Just be sure that you can repeat it at least five times.|`|B12E4rYiaa	Most people go by how much you weight and if you can bench your own weight or more then that is good. If you're under 18 it's best not to build as yet but to tone do do more reps instead of adding more weight.|`|6sPcYQr0aa	A good rule of thumb, its that if you can bench (free weight), your own weight, you are stronger than most. Most people can't bench their own.|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	If by that you mean you can rep 130, then that is extremely good. If you can max or do less than 5 reps with it, then thats good.

AA10454278	hmmmm, A very good quesstion. <br>  <br>  I have been an asthmatic since 1954 and never have had a migraine at the same time.  I am on a lot of asthma boards and have seen a lot of doctors for my asthma through the years and have never seen your question before.<br>  <br>  I know you will probably get this answer a  lot but here goes anyway......<br>  <br>  Check with your doctor<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless
AA11707529	First, what type hair do you have? Dry, normal, or oily? Mine is oily [meaning it gets dirty real fast], and I use a "clarifying" shampoo. The thing is, if I use too much shampoo, or too much conditioner, my scalp gets really itchy, and I get dandruff. <br>  <br>  Find a shampoo for "normal to oily hair" or one that says "clarifying" on it, and use just enough to cover your head... no excess. The same with the conditioner -- again, for normal-to-oily hair. If you use too much conditioner it will dry out your scalp, and make it itchy. <br>  <br>  Once you get it right, the itchiness will stop until your hair needs washing again. That's the way oily hair works. Before I figured out my hair was oily I used "normal" products, and my head itched constantly. <br>  <br>  Try these things, and remember, you may have to experiment a few times on how much shampoo and conditioner to use at first. And NEVER use a shampoo/conditioner mix; that never works with oily hair.|`|VsMtCrk7aa	You may have allergies to the hair products you use. Try some hypoallergenic products for your hair care.

AA12266052	Coccidioidomycosis is a pulmonary or hematogenous disease caused by the fungus Coccidioides immitis, usually occurring as an acute benign asymptomatic or self-limited respiratory infection. The organism occasionally disseminates to cause focal lesions in other tissues. Symptoms, if present, are those of lower respiratory infection or low-grade nonspecific disseminated disease. Diagnosis is suspected by clinical and epidemiologic characteristics and confirmed by chest x-ray, culture, and serology. Treatment, if needed, is usually with fluconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin B.
AA11348786	When I was younger, I was in the admitted to a hospital for phlibitis.I couldn't walk, and after being placed in a room that finally came available late at night, I was placed next to a patient who was dying from emphysema. The room was not well lit, and I never have, or will ever forget that night. He struggled for breath, fighting to live until my medication overcame my ability to put the sound of his deep breathing out of my earshot. I turned my back to the idea of the clicking of the machine that I believe was helping his airflow and fell asleep. I awoke to an empty bed, and in asking the nurse, who was changing the sheet on the other bed about my roommate, she explained that he had died during the night. I would not wish emphysema on my worst enemy because I know that this is a horrible way to surrender life. I hope that compassion is in the heart of any support grouping, of anyone with this malady.Really, not a good thing, at all.|`|uGIzTttsaa	well i found a website about lung cancer that i thought would help <a href="http://www.lungusa.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=dvLUK9O0E&b=2060245&content_id={62C3D98B-887D-4C19-B7AA-C558C240D450}&notoc=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.lungusa.org/site/apps/nlnet/c...</a><br>  <br>  i hope that helps also <br>  <a href="http://copd.about.com/od/whatisemphysema/a/emphysema.htm" rel="nofollow">http://copd.about.com/od/whatisemphysema...</a>

683fba774a10fec8e7e8b8ea4c6b7561aa	There are no periods without the discharge of blood, which is caused due to the regular cyclic desquamation of the endometrium of the uterus.<br>  But rarely in girls especially at the time of their attaining their menarche, they may have cramps, feeling of discharge, but no blood seen! This may be due to a congenital imperforated hymen, thick hymen, or a hymen with a small hole when the discharge of the periods is accumulated in the vagina giving a picture of a hemocolpos. However there no need to worry in this regard; as a simple hymenectomy, or a suitable drainage of the menstrual fluid may relieve and cure the condition.|`|mTyRnCMmaa	you cant have a period with no blood coming out otherwise that defeats the point of it.  a period is the lining of the womb coming out when the egg is not fertilised|`|svtrTIz3aa	how it could be happen?<br>  of course no|`|9YlQ5HEhaa	It could be that the blood is clotting and becoming stuck inside you...I think that must be what you mean...then you might have to have minor surgery, or sometimes they can bring it on medically.
pMmOXlZ6aa	Its not unhealthy, but it will be really hard for your body to work at its full potential, if its being starved till 4 pm. Your stomach will shrink, and you will become weak|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It doesn’t really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|sqR0iyuWaa	Yeah, it could slow down your metabolism so that if you start eating a more normal amount, you'll gain weight quickly. <br>  <br>  I eat all the time, but I know people who are much heavier than me who always seem to say they're not hungry. They probably don't eat often enough.<br>  <br>  But if you feel healthy, then maybe this eating pattern just works well for you. Everyone is different.|`|KicLroHDaa	That habit puts your body in a constant survival mode, everything you eat will turn to fat in a survival effort to preserve energy.<br>  <br>  Having small meals throughout the day is the healthiest way to go.|`|E4WGxzXzaa	yes its unhealthy. you will slow down your metabolism eventually causing yourself to gain weight when you do eat. you need to eat regularily throughout the day.|`|FoEWvYEsaa	it will slow down your metabolism..you need to eat something for breakfast even if its a granola bar on your way to school...|`|A0SO84Mzaa	This is extremely unhealthy. Basically, you are starving yourself until 4. Your metabolism is going to slow to a crawl, you will have much less energy through out the day, what ever you do eat will be stored as fat, your body will use what ever means possible to keep you alive so it will comsume your muscular tissue, and your brain function will also slow to a crawl when compared to when you are supplying it with a steady source of nutrition. You really should eat at least 3 meals a day, or 6 smaller meals spread through out the day. It is very true what they say, breakfast is the most important meal of the day. You are breaking your fast. Basically, if you don't eat enough then you are slowly starving yourself to death (literally).|`|vIIsf9ezaa	As long as the meal is a well balanced one it isn't too terrible, I ate like that for a long time.<br>  <br>  However, if you are too busy to eat, buy some bagels.

Some women resume ovulation immediately, while it can take several months for others.

n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  STDs are diseases that you get by having sex and are the most common infectious diseases in the United States. They are diseases that you get by having sexual contact (vaginal, oral, or anal) with someone who already has an STD. <br>  <br>  The only way to know is to be tested. Although STDs sometimes have symptoms, it is very common for girls not to have any, especially in the early stages. By the time symptoms do show up, the infection can be advanced. Remember, you may not always recognize STD symptoms.<br>  <br>  Condoms provide good, but not perfect, protection against some STDs, especially gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and trichomoniasis. But condoms do not provide complete protection against all STDs. Some STDs like herpes, HPV (warts) and syphilis can still be transmitted through contact with areas that are not covered by a condom.<br>  <br>  If you follow the link, you will find more information about STDs like; <br>  Q.

KdFXk0ajaa	Blood tests are not accurate screening tools for marijuana use. The urinalysis is more accurate not for the THC itself but for the metabolites associated with the THC. Maybe the pediatrician was concentrating on other illegal drugs. Here is a link from NORML. National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws. It explains what might have happened. Plus the specific gravity (weight of urine in relation to water) has to fall within certain parameters for an accurate test. Back in my military days guys in the lab would either add water to, or leave the cap off of samples to make the specfic gravity either too high or low for an accurate test. Here is some of the content from the link below:<br>  <br>  B – blood testing<br>  <br>  Blood tests, unlike urinalysis, detect the presence illicit drugs, not inactive drug metabolites. In general, THC only remains detectable in the blood of cannabis consumers for a few hours (though low, residual levels may be detected in chronic smokers for up to 12-24+ hours if more sensitive technology is used). Because of this narrow detection window, blood tests are typically only administered in the workplace post-accident in order to estimate recent cannabis consumption. Therefore, most after-hours consumers have little to fear from a blood screen.<br>  <br>  Of the estimated 55 million drug tests performed annually in the United States, approximately 90 percent of these are urine tests. While often inaccurately referred to by employers and drug testers as an impairment test, urinalysis can not detect the presence of any illicit drugs – including marijuana – and can only identify the presence of non-psychoactive drug metabolites indicating that a substance has been previously consumed at an unspecified point in time. Unfortunately for cannabis consumers, pot’s primary metabolite THC-COOH is fat soluble, and may remain detectable in urine for days and sometimes two-to-three weeks after past use in regular smokers. Fortunately, most standard urine tests can be easily influenced by dilution.<br>  <br>  Guess you dodged a bullet however if a sensitive test is used looking specifically for marijuana by urinalysis.. it would take 30+ days for you to come up clean on a urine drug screen.|`|sO13nCh6aa	Luck....the drug tests that are given initially aren't very specific or accurate.

sQu3LLqtaa	A women's energy multivitamin every day should help as they contain extra B vitamins for energy.<br>  <br>  Coenzyme Q10 is produced within our bodies but less is produced as you get older so with advancing age it would help if you take it.  Perhaps the right time to start taking it is when you are past 60.  You can find further information in a web search for "coenzyme q10" + energy.|`|H0aiDO9Paa	According to the majority of the research. CoQ10, a naturally occurring body chemical, is an important factor in helping cells turn food into energy. All cells need to generate energy, so in theory supplemental CoQ10 might help congestive heart failure by enabling heart-muscle cell to contract more forcefully. In addition, CoQ10 is an antioxidant, so it theoretically may help prevent further weakening of the heart muscle by preventing chemical damage from oxidation. Some older studies on the effect of CoQ10 supplements in heart-failure patients have shown slight improvement. However, all those studies had significant limitations. In contrast, two recent, better-designed clinical trial found no improvement. On balance, the existing evidence does not support the use of CoQ10 for heart failure. And good luck.

It is something that every restaurant can make and will not overwhelm you with calories.<br>  <br>  But you need to cut out the snacking if you want to lose 10 more pounds.  No cookies, stick to things like fruits which have plenty of naturally occuring sugars for your sugar cravings!|`|17ixPSQQaa	Subway is way to go if your hungry but don't want to cook. Just remember not to get oil or salt on the sandwich. Stick with the turkey or the chicken sandwich and try to limit your pickle, olive,peppercini, jalapeno intake cuz the contain alot of salt.<br>  <br>      Most fast food places have salads.|`|z3z1qz7Maa	Eat more fruits and veggies.

Just think for a minute that you have probably tasted everything anyway.  So, remembering what it taste like and also smelling it do a reverse.  Order the salad or the fruit cup, ice tea without sugar.  Or if it's a Restaurant ,be like the the rest, you know like skinny girls already do play with your food and offer it out for taste The next day you'll have leftovers for lunch.Food Courts also have low cal varieties to try.  Believe me, this hard, it's been said that food addiction is the hardest to break away from because it involves so many choices to give up.<br>  And, the big thing we forgot and all would like to forget is our daily exercises.  Start out with walking and maybe tapes or even low-key ex. right under your desk.<br>  I think you've got the concept and you're going to make it.  So, pass by the food court and go and buy your swim suit because everybody will be seeing less and less of you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck,  It feels good to do something for yourself.<br>  <br>  Your Kitchen sounds find.  Just get some fresh fruit for a snack sometime.

AA11447210	How many calories you burn depends on your own weight, and the intensity you workout for the duration of your exercise.<br>  <br>  Check the source link for a calories burned calculator that may give you an idea of what you're burning.|`|1dL6fU0Haa	1 hour of elliptical will usually burn between 500-700 calories.  That depends on your weight and the level of intensity that you are working at.  Most machines will allow you to input your weight before you begin your workout so if you do that you will have a more accurate record of how much you are burning during your workouts.|`|tDjqjmCMaa	It is possible to lose weight rapidly but you should be realistic and understand that if you lose weight rapidly then you will almost certainly put it all back on again just as rapidly. The one method that really showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials left, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today.

6YnwXCIaaa	Chiropractic school is 4 years.  These schools are accredited, but they're accredited by chiropractors so make of that what you will.  From what I've heard, there are some schools that are very good and there are some that really only want your money.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I would not go to a chiropractor who claims to be able to treat anything like infectious diseases, cancer, heart disease, lung disease, or really anything but musculoskeletal disease.  I am dubious about their overall training in basic principles of health and disease.  Also, beware the chiro (or anyone) who tries to get you to sign up for 3 appointments a week for years on end.  They're being good business people, but perhaps not the best health care advocate.  Do not do cervical spine manipulation if you aren't comfortable with it.  There is an association between that and strokes.  It might be small, but it is preventable (in that, if you don't have cervical manipulation, it can't cause a stroke from a carotid dissection).

AA11048920	You would have to ask a neurologist that question. I do know that the lesion hasto be in the white matter of the brain. There are also lots of things that cause lesions such as certain drugs and medicines, strokes, cancer, viruses and infections, head trauma, surgury  as well as headaches to name a few. A lesions is any abnormality in the brain. Many people are born with  lesions and they are merely indicative of the fact that the brain is not perfectly formed like everything else in the body. I have a grilfriend who was diagnosed with MS where I live. However when she went to a neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic, he told her that the lesions she had on her MRI were indicative of the type caused by  migrain headaches not MS. Having a lesion is not necessarily proof of MS. A neurologist will only diagnosis MS, if  she/he sees both acitve and old lesions.  It took me ten year to get a defnitive diagnosis of MS. This is not an easy disease to dagnosis since the symptoms come and go and all of them are indicative of other diseases. I wish you luck I assure you that there is a lot of life after a diagnosis of MS. You might want to contact the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, or the Multiple Sclerosis Foundation. They both have websites. You can always join an on-line MS group right here on the web at Yahoo. Just visit Yahoo Groups.

Whether you get better depends on you.  <br>  1) Get exercise<br>  2) Meditate for 10 minutes every day.  Do more when you can.  It'll get easier with time.<br>  3) Get your omega-3s.  Capsules or oily fish (mackerel, sardines, anchovies).  <br>  <br>  This is not an overnight cure.  It took me about a month to notice any changes.  By the way if you are manic and elated as much as you are angry then you may be bipolar.  At least what the medical community labels bipolar.  If you only get angry, you may be depressive.  Either way I've been there and the most helpful thing I've ever done is start meditating.  It clears your mind, quietens annoying voices, stables moods and enhances concentration.  It does take time though.  But everyone can do it.  Good luck, you'll be fine.|`|sAN0IDOeaa	well it could be borderline personality disorder. my mom was misdiagnosed as being bi-polar but was really that other thing

ufgv7oTjaa	I've never heard of them before, but the best way to find out would be to call the company and ask them to prove their quality.

8VUZDKdAaa	I realize different people have different ways of responding to different drugs.  In my personal experience, I did not respond to Lexapro at all.

I understand this is not always the case.|`|cnnu1IFtaa	Yes - Lexapro is escitalopram, which is the active isomer of the drug citalopram (celexa).

iK3YYRaTaa	And the answer is:<br>  What Are Normal Blood Glucose And Blood Sugar Levels<br>  There are various methods to determine blood glucose level. Some tests give you accurate diagnosis of diabetes or pre-diabetes, while others will tell you how well you are managing your diabetes. <br>  <br>  Fasting Blood Sugar Test:<br>  Measures the blood sugar level after 8 hours fast or overnight. Normal fasting blood glucose level is less than 100mg/dl. If your fasting blood glucose level is from 100mg/dl to 125mg/dl then you will have impaired blood glucose level also known as Pre-Diabetes. If your blood glucose level is above 125mg/dl then your doctor will diagnose as a patient of diabetes. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may repeat the fasting blood glucose test on any other day. If you have blood glucose level of 126mg/dl or higher in two consecutive tests, then you may have diabetes. If you have blood glucose level greater than 200mg/dl and you have symptoms of diabetes like increased thirst or hunger, frequent urination, weight loss, blurred vision etc, then you may be diagnosed with diabetes mellitus without confirming it with second test. <br>  <br>  Random Blood Glucose Test:<br>  Random blood Glucose test gives your blood sugar at any time in a day. Normal random blood sugar level should be less than 200mg/dl. If your random blood glucose level is between 140mg/dl to 200mg/dl then you will have pre-diabetes. <br>  <br>  Oral glucose tolerance test<br>  This test measures your response to sugar. First we measure fasting blood glucose level, and then glucose solution is given, after that we measure blood glucose after 1 hour and 2hours. A normal blood glucose level after an oral glucose tolerance test is less than 140 mg/dL. Level between 140 mg/dL to 199 mg/dL suggests pre-diabetes. A blood glucose level of 200 mg/dL or higher two hours after you drink the glucose solution may suggest that you have diabetes mellitus. <br>  <br>  Glycated hemoglobin (A1C) test><br>  This test is not for diagnosing diabetes, but it shows you how well you have controlled your sugar in last 2 or 3 months. Normal value is less than 7%, however if it is more than 7 then you and your doctor should think of changing your treatment of diabetes. <br>  <br>  Always Remember, your blood glucose measurement alone is not enough to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may do some other tests to find out which type of diabetes you have.<br>  <br>  From an article:<br>  you don't have normal sugars for a certain age and weight. Your ped endo is very kind. In a normal nondiabetic patient when we are considering criteria for diabetes we look to the latest ADA criteria. <br>  Criteria are as follows, fasting sugars should be under 126, sugars 2 hours after glucose load and mixed meal at times should be under 140, random sugars should all be under 200. If you drink a coke, no doubt we could get your sugar up there and it would be handled fine. Now also you may wake with a sugar of 65 and this be normal as well. <br>  Now in my kids with diabetes, I want their sugar to stay above 70 so they do not go low! <br>  I hope for bedtime sugars about 120 if they are little, so sugar norms are relative.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	When my son was 7, low was considered under 80.  Check with kid's parents to see what they consider low.  Any time my son said he was low, I'd check his sugar to see if he was right.  More often than not, he was low when he said he was.  Check to be sure.

You should have the parents contact the hospital or childs dr to see what's in your area.  If wouldn't hurt to make you aware of things and how to treat him.  They should have you a care card, that is how to treat him if he's has a low sugar and what to do in an emergency.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	You must absolutely talk to the parents about what levels this child should be at. Usually the kid is right, especially when it comes to the very nasty taste of the glucose tablets.

A1c less than 7<br>  Before meals 90-130 <br>  1-2 hours after meals <180<br>  <br>  AACE says... A1c less than 6.5<br>  Before meals less than 110<br>  1-2 hours after meals <140<br>  <br>  Check with the parents as to what constitutes a low!|`|EMmGFqgJaa	Yeah if your babying sitting a kid with diabetics they parents should really give you the information on that.

jdah4ZA2aa	You need to get to the root of the self-issue problems that lead you to having these issues with food.  Food problems are a symptom.  We use it to fill voids or to gain control when we lack it.  Perhaps see a therapist?

LGdwi71Qaa	go to the emergency room if you vision is impaired and your body doesn't feel right you need to be seen imediatly|`|H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible. If a minor blow to the head causes any of the following problems: a visible wound; classic signs of concussion, including loss of consciousness, disturbed vision, headache, stiff neck, nausea, confusion, or unsteady gait; or any symptoms that worsen in the days after the blow or fall. In such cases a doctor will test your memory, concentration, and coordination, any of which may be impaired if the brain is damaged. Questionable finding may warrant a closer look with a CT scan or an MRI. Both exams can reveal signs of bleeding in the brain, which may require surgical drainage. (Resist taking anything but acetaminophen to squelch pain; aspirin, ibuprofen, and other anti-inflammatory drugs can increase bleeding and mask certain worsening symptoms.) Note that you're not out of the woods for 8 to 12 weeks. During that time, blood can collect under the covering of the brain, causing subtle symptoms such as balance problems or involuntary hand or foot movement. If so, drainage would also be required. And good luck.
34VXCyvVaa	Yes.  If you are diagnosed with several types of cancer at one time (say, breast cancer and brain cancer), then one is usually the primary cancer and the other cancer has metastasized (spread from) the first cancer.  But you can also get different types of cancer at different times in your life.  Sometimes treatment for the first cancer puts you at greater risk of other cancers.  Sometimes other factors (genetics, smoking, environmental factors such as secondhand smoke and chemical exposure on the job) can put you at greater risk.|`|kZT828wJaa	You can randomly happen to get more than one type of cancer, but its unusual as it would generally be a random occurrence. While it is true that cancer can spread if its in stage four (metastasis) it remains the same form of cancer. Lung cancer which spreads to your brain, spinal cord, or liver, remains as "lung cancer" regardless of where it goes. This holds true for all forms of cancer, as the type of cells that are spreading are all from the original organ, it doesn't corrupt different cell types in organs it spreads to.<br>  <br>  That said, it is of course possible to randomly acquire more than one form of cancer, and I know people who have had one form of cancer, and gone on years later to acquire another form, but this is usually unrelated, just very bad luck.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	Certainly. The original cancer can spread (so your lung cancer becomes, say, liver cancer), or two unrelated cancers can occur.|`|9924978a027d4db9bf72b068fc058d30aa	Yes.|`|iSayo0kwaa	Sad to say there are over 200 types of cancer.<br>  The cell the cancer attacks is the type of cancer he/she gets.<br>  Unfortunately it can spread to any of the 60+ organs in the body.|`|D4XWrwuaaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Personally I have had colon cancer twice and liver cancer right now.|`|hBmafVYoaa	Absolutely.

2z1h5mfOaa	I don't know what you weigh, how tall you are or your age (I gather you're quite young).  It's difficult to advise, as it really depends on these three factors.  Nowadays a lot of women want to lose weight and are starving themselves - you said "if you already exercising and eating f**k all?"<br>  I have had a real weight problem all my life, and all I can say is that Weightwatchers have really helped me now and in the past to lose weight because I really needed it for health reasons.  What I like about their plan is that it is there, for you, for the rest of your life, if you agree to stick with it. It will help you stay within your goal weight limits once you have achieved it, rather than going on yo-yo dieting, following some silly weight loss programme because that's what a celebrity has done etc.  Weight Watchers don't deny you any food.  They just make you aware of what you are eating and how what you eat / drink etc will affect your weight and your health.  I can fully endorse them if you really need to lose weight or feel you are not eating the right stuff.|`|2eGMXYaIaa	You need to do cardio! When I say that you have to work hard and get your heart rate up. So many people say they do cardio but they walk or job leisurely on the treadmill or elliptical. Running is the best way to shred excess fat (make sure you have good knees). It's not about losing 2 or 3 pounds here and there because it is very easy to gain it back. You have to change the complexion of how your body functions. Consistency is the key. <br>  <br>  The more you workout your metabolism will burn fat at a higher rate. <br>  Eventually you want your body to work for you, not work for your body (if that makes sense). And if you want to lift and workout I recommend doing high intensity circuit workouts where you are doing an exercise one after another, to again, get your heart rate up and increase your fitness level (not be one of the those people we do a set, rest for 2-3 minutes and do another one). There is too much down time, that's good for increasing strength but not overall fitness. Diet is just as important as working out!|`|4w5kDz9daa	I would like to share 3 of my favorite tips to help you get started on a weight loss journey. Just by following these simple steps you'll learn how you can fight obesity and start losing weight today. You'll soon discover that you have more energy and confidence than you ever thought possible.<br>  <br>  More Info Here:-<br>  <br>  <a href="http://healthcaretips4life.blogspot.com/search/label/Body%20Weight%20Tips" rel="nofollow">http://healthcaretips4life.blogspot.com/...</a>|`|VZIPRJ3eaa	When it comes to losing weight, there are 2 ways to do it:<br>  1*)  I just want to lose weight.. I don't care what kind, I just want to see the scale go down.<br>  2**)  I want to lose fat and only fat.  I don't want to lose muscle.  <br>  <br>  1*)  Losing weight is much easier than just losing fat, but for many people, this is still their primary goal.. especially very obese people.  They just want the scale to drop.  If that's your goal, I would strongly suggest the Weight Watchers diet over all other diets.  It's very effective, easy to do, and proven to be the best overall "lose weight" diet around, over all others.  It even won the "Diet Face-Off" at livestrong.com, when all weight loss diets were competing against each other. Read more here:  <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/diet-face-off/" rel="nofollow">http://www.livestrong.com/diet-face-off/</a> <br>  <br>  2**)  Losing fat only is much tougher, but..  it's the ideal way to lose weight.  Any time you lose weight, you can only lose muscle, fat or both (water too.. but that's not true weight).  With most "diets", you are going to lose as much muscle as fat, and usually more.  Losing "fat only" is what you want to do if you're trying to look the best you can for the pool this summer.  You definitely want to keep all the muscle you can.  Think about 2 guys.. both 5'11 and 180.  One has a belly with fat and the other, exact same height and weight, is ripped, with abs and looks like a walking anatomy chart.  His goal has been to lose fat.. not weight.  The best 2 diets for this are 'Body For Life' (<a href="http://bodyforlife.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://bodyforlife.com/)</a> and 'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' (<a href="http://www.burnthefat.com/)." rel="nofollow">http://www.burnthefat.com/).</a>  Both will yield results at burning fat only.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is the better of the two.. as it will even demonstrate how to add muscle while burning fat.. the true secret to getting "ripped"!  'Body For Life' can be found at any bookstore.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is available online only.  It's a 340 page pdf document created by bodybuilder Tom Venudo (who has only 4% bodyfat and is over 40 years old!).  They also have a great member site that you can join for $10 a month here:  <a href="http://www.burnthefatinnercircle.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.burnthefatinnercircle.com</a> .  Tom answers your questions himself on that site.. instead of other sites that just give you a host of all the other members offering advice.  Both of the diets encourage the same.. eating 6 meals a day (females can opt for 5) and cardio several times a week.  Body For Life is a little more geared toward fat burning only though.  You won't gain much muscle.. but if you have  muscle already, you can rip up very nicely.  'Burn the Fat, Feed the Muscle' is the most work for sure, but will yield the most impressive results of any diet on the market today.  <br>  <br>  Why so many meals a day?  Your body needs a continual supply of glycogen for energy.  Eating every 3 hours, the food is digested and directed into cells requiring energy right then.  Once the cells have received all the energy they need, the body stores the extra glycogen in your muscles and liver.  However, there's only so mcuh glycogen your body can store.  Eating more than you should at any one meal makes extra glycogen now convert to fat.  This is why you have to know exactly how many calories you need every day.. and why it's so important to eat the right amount at every meal.  Remember.. 1 pound of fat, is just 3500 extra calories that your body stores.  It doesn't take long to put an extra 3500 calories in your body.  <br>  <br>  What if I eat a lot less so my body can't store the extra calories as fat?  Even worse.. your body is smart enough to realize that it doesn't have enough calories it needs for the day (your BMI) and to compensate, it slows down your metabolism, so it doesn't burn calories as fast.  And.. anytime your body is in this fasted state, it takes emergency precautions.  It tries to hang on to energy as long as possible, so it quits burning fat for energy altogether and starts tearing your muscles down for energy.  Muscle is anabolically active tissue, so this is the easiest place for your body to get needed energy.  If you do this day after day, you will become sluggish and tired from a slow metabolism and your body will lose most of its weight from muscle.  Some fat will get burned this way too.. but it's the last to go!  Your body will start breaking fat down last, after it has used as much as it can from your muscles!<br>  <br>  In summary, the best way to lose weight is burn fat through eating right and then exercising it off.  Starving fat doesn't work.  A girl should be getting around 1500 calories a day.  <br>  <br>  One more note.. if you're very obese or way too thin, BMI calculators often won't show the correct results for you.  See a fitness professional or your doctor to determine your BMI.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
6sPcYQr0aa	Everyone make the mistake that if you have belly fat to work out the belly to get rid of it..... nope, you got to work out the full body.<br>  It doesn’t really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|1dL6fU0Haa	Actually, all abdominal exercises can be equally effective at working the stomach muscles when performed properly.  Personally, my favorite exercise is the decline crunch because I find the extra-added stress of gravity on my abs really helps me to isolate the muscle.  However, someone else may favor leg raises as their ultimate ab blasting exercise for its high-intensity and challenging level of difficulty.<br>  <br>  The important point here is that everyone is unique and we will all have varied responses to different types of stimuli and one exercise may be more effective for one person over another.  That is why it is up to you to experiment and find out which exercises will challenge you the most and give you the best results.<br>  <br>  My recommendation:  Variety is key!  Doing the same exercises over and over will only lead to staleness and force your body to plateau.  If you really want to work the abs good, try doing a new exercise each week and work it to failure.  Keeping the body guessing will help to maintain a constant state of change and adaptation!   <br>  <br>  For more info, check out a free personal training website:  <a href="http://www.one80.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.one80.com</a><br>  Here you can have a program tailored to your workout needs everyday that will include tons of ab exercises with video support to help you with your belly.

zx5zzf53aa	What works better and faster: low carb<br>  What is easier to stick to and keep the weight off in the log term: low fat|`|G1OSlub8aa	low fat, your body needs carbs.|`|MN4M1tqsaa	no question about it, low carb has been shown over and over and over to be the best diet for fat loss.  Low fat was a fad in the 90's that led everyone to eat processed sugary foods which lead to obesity.  Don't go low fat, you wont get anywhere.  In fact, fat is needed so you will be hurting yourself.  Carbs cause a large insulin release which makes the body go into "storage mode" because it thinks it has an abundance of food and will try to store the carbs as fat.  protein and fat trigger no insulin release so the fuel is not stored.  insulin is generally required for fat production and today's processed foods cause massive unnatural insulin spikes.|`|EMmGFqgJaa	The news just talked about a study on loosing weight <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/25/best.diet/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/25/bes...</a><br>  <br>  Like the above poster said there is nothing wrong with carbs. If you don't take in carbs you don't have energy. The bad thing is simple carbs vs complex carbs. Complex carbs are better for your body because they get slowly released into the body and they are typically whole wheat items and certain kinds of pasta. Simple carbs get turned to fat quicker because if you don't use them as energy. They are white bread, plain bagels, potatoes, etc.<br>  <br>  If you read the study like what most nutritionists say the only way to loose weight or maintain a healthy weight is to watch the amount of calories you take in. If you want to loose weight you need to burn more calories than you take in.|`|y4eTE1Ihaa	The obvious way to burn fat is to eat less and workout more often, the problems appear when we in reality try to put that into operation! There are plenty of stumbling blocks out there aren't there?! The only diet that really showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it was highlighted in Fox News and USA Today. I shed 30 pounds, it really does produce results!
6eLNPhiOaa	I am suffering from exactly the same symptoms as you have described.  The feeling of not being able to complete your breath in, having to yawn to finish it.  Without meaning to scare you I have just spent 5 weeks in hospital with an asthma attack, and came out laden with nebuliser, steroids and inhalers.  Having had loads of tests done, yes I have asthma, but I also have what is called dysfunctional breathing!  Which I think means that your breathing pattern goes sporadic and a miss.  It is (so Im told) nothing to worry about but will have to try to retrain my brain to breathe normally again.  Hope this helps.  Thanks|`|qSwGwO5Kaa	Stress and anxiety can cause people shortness of breath or breathing troubles. And see a doctor is good advice. Good luck!

2z1h5mfOaa	Wait and see how it goes - there is a lot of "gastric flu" around and sometimes it only affects you mildly.  If it persists after a week, and you have no other symptoms, go and see your doctor. If you do get other symptoms, and they are worrying you, check with doctor.  Gastric flu tends to have symptoms of sickness (nausea/vomiting) as well as headaches, feeling flushed or having a temperature, perhaps diarrhea and feeling really feeling below par, and sometimes also aching muscles.  If in doubt, if you feel really poorly, seek medical advice.
6YnwXCIaaa	It sounds like you're generally deconditioned.  Good for you for getting more active.  You don't have to go full bore at once; just keep working at it and the shortness of breath and leg soreness will gradually lessen.|`|13cc03f46e318a1a2bae06264512cbc6aa	Living a sedimentary life style will do that.  You get a build up of sediment so to say.  Do very light stretches as part of your routine.  Our bodies sometimes hate exercise when we have been laying around.  The stretches can help the muscles and the veins in the back of your legs get going again.  Massage your legs, too.  <br>  Eat high anti oxidant foods and take a light multi vitamin.  Don't lay in bed for more than 8 hours.  Drink lots of water because your body will try to flush the trapped toxins ie the sediment.  Those toxins are also what will make you feel sluggish and light aches and pains until you get this fixed.<br>  <br>  Go to the doctor and get a check up to put your mind at rest.|`|6TFrcaoyaa	your just not conditioned. your calves (back of your legs) are the main muscle that you use to walk, theyre sore cuz thyre not conditioned. same with your shortness of breath, just need to build up your stamina. and if your doing this all the time now, your body will get conditioned, so the shortness of breath, soreness, and tiredness will go away.|`|5jqFOTSDaa	among the other things others have said you might want to get on a normal sleep patter like got to bed at 9 or 10 and get up at 7 or 8, it sound early but if you got to sleep by 10 and got up at 7 that 8 hours of sleep! also do you have an occupation? and not just a job but other things you like to do? having things to do will help keep you active with out having to go for a walk for the sole purpose of exercise, maybe get a dog and walk it twice a day.|`|DibzbnVhaa	sounds like lack of exercise and a bad diet.

lz302Y1Xaa	We went over something like this in Stress Management. You're probably talking about the "twilight" phase of sleep, as she called it. It's like the very beginning stage of sleep where your mind is half-asleep and you might see some things that aren't there, but you also can still be aware of what is going on around you.|`|3LJbKwKjaa	When the brain sleep, electrical activities are less than in the day time. Neurons works whit electrical energies (small energy). Normally, exist a right source of this small energy. In the night time, this source must be slowly, sleepy. If you eat after 7: 30 PM is possible to have little problems with sleep.|`|VEYBxej2aa	You may be thinking of sleep paralysis. This can happen when just dropping off to sleep or when waking up. During sleep, the brain sends out a chemical through the body which effectively 'paralyses' you during periods of REM sleep, with the intention that you won't act out your dreams. Sometimes the brain produces too much of this or mistimes its production and as you start to fall asleep [or start to wake up] the chemical is still in your body, although your brain is beginning to wake up. Sometimes you may be in the middle of a dream but can still see or hear what's happening in the room around you, at the same time. Sometimes you are just completely awake and aware, but paralysed for a short time. It can be pretty scary, but relaxing your body will bring you out of it faster.

As long as the condom did not bust while inside, or his semen did not get in or around that area you should be fine. Those tests are pretty accurate and only like 1% of the time they are wrong. Just in case, I would keep your appointment with the doctor. Your would have been better off waiting until your married.|`|BRDqfAy3aa	read below - "Missed period - are you pregnant?"|`|pCEAIihqaa	Probably not. Taking plan B throws off your cycle. It made your period come early and then you may not get your next period until 4 weeks after you were originally supposed to get your period.|`|2VeQdw03aa	ffffff|`|eus7WqzUaa	Your not preg.  You are gonna be just fine.  Prevention/pills/depo shot/etc can cause a change in your period. If you stress to much you will not have one either. Just relax. You do need to get blood work done to check your levels.  <br>  <br>  Look, this is a newer form of birth control.  You do need to go to the doctors but I think your fine.  I think you need to go for your peace of mind.  See what other birth control is avaliable for you.|`|fKuvMPCiaa	No, you can miss a period because of stress or sickness. you might be so worried about being pregnant that you're stressing yourself out and that is why your period is late. If the 3 pregnancy tests are negative then it's pretty much guaranteed that you're not.|`|F46UH3WYaa	Maybe. The levels probably arent high enough for the hpt. Once you go to the OBGYN and do the blood test and get the results, then you can make decisions. I took a hpt and it was negative but it showed up once I went to the doctor.|`|AA10331655	I dont think you are.......with  3 negative tests its very unlikely, your period may be late because of stress or because of the plan b...but definetly put your mind at ease and see your obgyn|`|fB7HJgAHaa	wow..is this question actually going anywhere...wherever that place is...its very very far away from me.|`|PN7XMglOaa	Yes , you are pregnant .|`|5tbFuG1Maa	yes im in LA|`|6grpWNO3aa	Plan B was your menstrual cycle. This is the reason you bled for more than a week because there was no egg to fertilize therefore causing you to menstruate and tricking your body. Now because of this, your body may be a little out of wack from the normal and it will take time for you to ovulate again, therefore giving you another menstrual cycle. If you are stressing out then this will cause you not to ovulate, due to the body being stressed. Relax, more than likely you are not pregnant, and you should ovulate shortly therefore, you will get a period 10 days later.|`|ZS38T8M7aa	It doesn't sound like you are pregnant because you don't have the symptoms of pregnancy.<br>  When I got my period late once, I looked it up in a medical book and missed periods can be related to stress, among other things.<br>  This turned out to be why I missed my period, and now they are regular again. I suggest trying to de-stress. This may be the cause.|`|eMSP740Taa	No i really don't. I think that the whole Plan B thing may have messed up your cycle and that's probably why you bled so much. It also depends on what day of your cycle you had sex on. Women usually ovulate between days 13 and 15...so if you weren't even close to those days, the possibility is very minuet. If it was close to those days....then maybe there's a chance.|`|bcix4Fnfaa	Just b/c you do not feel or see symptoms of pregnancy does not mean you are not pregnant. Some woman (lucky woman) will not suffer allot of the symptoms until 6 to 8 weeks. I would see your doctor as soon as possible.

Hope all is well :)|`|dg83K2Uraa	If you took Plan B within the designated time frame then i would probably say NO... your period might have shifted because of the issue or because you were not using your nuva ring like you normally do.

qr1XzgeNaa	What it sounds like is just a small hematoma.  A hematoma is just a blood blister under your skin.  The ice will help the swelling go down and it will not be bad for the blood.  It will hurt for a while, but the best thing to do right now is RICE.  Slowly start moving your knee when you think its doing okay. But if you start to get a fever or chills, night sweats, it could be a sign of an infection.

You should gently open the top with a needle that has been stuck in a bar of soap and then open it where it has come to a head and VERY gently squeeze out the pus.  Then apply an antibiotic salve and don't pinch it or bruise it.  If you bruise it by popping then the tissue is already traumatized and will take longer to heal.

You should go to the hospital or your doctor ASAP.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|c55O7jqXaa	You probably need to have it checked out, but I suggest icing it 20 minutes on and then 1 hour off and 20 minutes on again. Take a stronger pain reliever like Ibuprofen and see if that helps. You could be low on potassium. Increase your bananas in your diet and gatorade and see if that helps. <br>  <br>  Otherwise go to the doctor and let them diagnose you and go from there.
5rJ6nf2oaa	You can do this. You don't have to buy anything except normal food.<br>  What you do have to do is to stick to a diet plan that works even if you don't feel like it. Otherwise nothing will help.<br>  <br>  Can you focus on following a diet for 8 weeks? If you can you will succeed. I do this diet every year and I know it works, normally I lose 1-2 kg per week. You can combine it with limiting calories to 1200-1400 per day or not, it's up to you. It was originally worked up by a doctor, Sandra Cabot, who specializes in liver and digestive system disorders. It's called The Liver Cleansing Diet and it works by rstoring your liver to optimal fat burning capacity amongst other good things.<br>  <br>  For 8 weeks, eliminate red meat, animal fats, dairy, all processed food and anything containing additives/colours/flavours etc. Replace with fish/seafood (not fried), some lean chicken, lots of fresh vegetables (raw is best), salad and fruit, and wholewheat bread, pasta and rice. Now you can see that carbs are included so there's no need to go hungry. The whole process will work faster if you drink lots of water and have a fresh raw vegie juice every morning (eg carrot, celery, apple).<br>  <br>  Read the articles I have attached for more info, included are tips to get started and an example diet plan. This is a nice diet. And it's free.<br>  <br>  Hope you like it and good luck.|`|PcJG3lrDaa	Well you see back in the days of the Civil war when Clara Barton transported water to the soldiers she was able to lose a great deal of weight maybe you should do something similar to that <br>  I hope I helped

Dont be so hard on yourself. Your a great person. Your obviously intelligent to be top of your class so often. And your friends value you more than you think. As for no-one liking you- you round nice enough to me, and i'd happily have you as a friend. <br>  <br>  You should talk to your family about things. Explain to them how bad it is and admit to your suicidal thoughts. No matter how many problems they have, they will want to know if your desperately unhappy.  I know you think they dont because Maybe their caught up in rows a lot or something, i dunno. But your their kid, and they'll still want to know. If you really cant bring yourself to talk to your family, talk to a teacher or a school counsellor. Or if it makes you feel better, write to your brother or visit him if possible.<br>  <br>  People pick up on negativity, low self worth and lack of social skills. People your age will either use that as a weakness and bully you because their little sh*ts, or they'll feel awkward with you and find you hard to understand. So you need to project yourself differently if you can.<br>  <br>  Make sure you walk tall and look people in the eyes. Smile whenever you can and say hello to people who may be friendly. Join some out of school groups as well.  Particularly team building ones, like acting or a sports team. Yep you'll feel uncomfortable- its way out of your comfort zone and stretching you, but it will help you learn new skills. You may like to look at assertiveness courses in your local area as well. <br>  <br>  If people laugh at you, but its in a friendly way, laugh with them rather than taking it to heart. Stop looking into things too deeply and analysing- most comments do not have a negative undercurrent. <br>  <br>  Remember, your probably a bit too sensitive right now. So you are often reading body language wrong. And you probably misunderstand a lot of what people are saying because your reading too much into it. Trust people more- there not all out to get you! <br>  <br>  The big thing here is not to care what people think of you! Hard i know, but you have to grow a thicker skin. If for some reason someone is nasty, let it bounce off you more. Rather than denting you. If this is something you cant manage on your own, talk to a therapist or counsellor who will help you change. I had to do that when i was your age, but it really helped.<br>  <br>  As for self harming- its probably a release of negative emotions towards yourself, and a way of feeling in control. I know its a terribly hard thing to control. The feelings that go with it feel too much of a release. But please think twice. My arms look terrible! And since i've got past that part of my life, looking at my scars really depress me. you DO have the strength to stop it. Just put your mind to it and stop seeing it as a comfort. Just tell yourself you really dont want to do it. And never consider suicide. It would be a terribly tragic waste of life. Your incredibly valuable , whether you think so or not.<br>  <br>  And your not a ***** in any way. Youre just someone whos shy, and a little bit socially inexperienced. You can build up from that though. I didnt start school till i was 8 because of medical issues and family problems. I was allowed to be taught at home. But then i had to start school. I found i didnt know how to talk to people or make friends, and that i had been taught things totally differently so i was behind in my work. Everyone already had there group of friends and knew what they were doing. I was bullied and people laughed at me. The teachers in the end actually made a child be friends with me because i was considered to have social problems. This made it worse as i then felt a total freak!  When i was in high school things had reached their worst. Bullying had got really severe, my self worth and self harm were at there worst. And my parents didnt know what to do with me. So i decided to fight my way out of it. I'll be honest, its f**king hard! And people react funny to you changing. You feel uncomfortable at first too. But it is able to be done and its worth it.  It took me several years to be completely better. But i also had several personal problems to deal with at the same time. So it could be quicker with you.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the monologue! Lol.  X|`|o4EGjfIJaa	i will be your friend :)|`|DLuDg2vyaa	I know how you're feeling, im supposed to be in year 10 going into year 11, in primary i had no friends at all, and in year 9, i had a mental breakdown.

Im 15, and i don't have any friends, and i also want someone to hold me and love me. <br>  <br>  I really wish i could help you, its a bad thing to be alone. <br>  Just stay close to your friends you have now, then sooner or later you'll be in college/sixth form doing things you love. Please keep your friends, because having absolutely no friends at all really screws with my sanity.<br>  <br>  Don't forget you are not alone.<br>  <br>  Im a total hypocrite, im not even in the situation for looking after myself, never mind someone else.|`|RLoilwCNaa	I don't even know you but I care.

I don't really have any experience but I'll give it a try. <br>  I typed in "self harm support" on google and there seems to be a lot of pages on it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.thesite.org/healthandwellbeing/mentalhealth/selfharm?gclid=CLzPxKDo-pgCFQFhQgoduzTAmA" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesite.org/healthandwellbein...</a><br>  <br>  I believe that when kids enter secondary school it's like a fresh start. The people who aren't from your school don't know anything about you so you can a good first impression and just talk to a lot of people in school and just try really hard to make friends. I know there are "divides" in schools as I see it at my school everyday, I joke about it but I wish it was gone. I know it sounds weird and I'm sorry but make friends with similar people who aren't "popular" and in a similar situation.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit: I tried to add you to my contacts list but you are not allowing anyone in. If you make contacts with people on here you can ask them questions about pretty much anything. You can ask me about anything anyway.|`|uCtj31SNaa	you should get some counsling.. and some self estem everyone feels this at some time you seem to focus on this and it makes it worse and other pic up on it.|`|A01gMQkuaa	firstly im sending you a great big friend hug. what you really need to do is talk to someone, are u brave enough to ask someone for help? its not easy i know. do u have any other relative you could go to ask? do you have pupil support at school? or you could ring your doctors and make an appointment for yourself. you cant go through this on your own, the first step is always asking for help. dont take too much time thinking about it just go for it just ask.once you start to talk about your problems life will get easier and you will feel better about yourself. it may take a while but u can and will get there. self harm is just a way of taking the pain from the inside to the outside, it never solves the problem just hides it for a few minutes. its a way of coping with whats goin on in your head. there are a lot of self harmers so your not alone.my heart goes out to you and i hope that you can find the inner strength that you have and ask for help. please do. it will help i promise.take care x|`|AA11348786	Sounds like depression. "If I were you", I'd call my mother and father right now, and tell them that "I need your help, right now". Don't worry about what you think they can handle about your situation. Please, tell the principle, a favorite teacher, a guidance counselor, a cop, a crossing guard, a priest, a rabbi, "a safe adult" that you trust, or a fireman. Someone in authority who will lead you from the confusion that you may be going through RIGHT NOW! You may not have a broken leg, but you are hurting more than you know. Let one of these types of people help the situation. Trust an adult who is a service provider. Its easy, and you can do this just by asking for help. This is what I would do for myself, and though I'm not giving you any kind of professional advice, some people might use this suggestion to thier benefit.|`|VEYBxej2aa	It might help to know that millions of people of all ages and backgrounds have felt like this at one point or another. Although you feel alone right now, I can promise you that there are millions of people who have felt the exact same way and have come through it and been happier. Sometimes it takes specific intervention, such as counselling or a change of address. Sometimes all it takes is time. I can appreciate it must be really difficult for you now - I've felt the same way you describe before, and I know I found it very lonely and difficult to deal with.<br>  <br>  As far as being called a freak, that was one of the things which used to bother me most. I was bullied for being different, because people simply didn't understand my view of life or the things I was interested in. Having grown older, I saw that almost all of the people who'd bullied me were unhappy themselves, and they were just passing it on in a vain attempt to feel better. If you're feeling insecure it's easy to put the spotlight onto someone else, but it doesn't work long-term.<br>  <br>  Now, however, I have more friends than I can keep up with, and they are all very different people who appreciate me for my idiosyncracies rather than put me down for them. They love me for me, even though they don't always understand me. I found these people naturally over time, and it's not something you can force but I can absolutely promise you, there are people out there who would be happy to be your friend. It's maybe just not the right time for you to meet them yet.<br>  <br>  I was called a freak because I was different. I still am different and I'm proud to be so, because it means I am being honest with myself. You're the only person who has to live with you 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, so it is so important that you can live with and love yourself. And now the people that love me, love me for being me, rather than for being a fake person I've created.<br>  <br>  I would advise that you ring a helpline such as ChildLine [0800 1111]. They'll listen to you first and foremost, and might give you advice if you really want it. But talking can help you to work through and identify your problems, and I promise that the people who work there care about you, even if they don't know you personally. I wish you the best of luck.|`|eVEUOGF4aa	Hi buddy.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I had the exact same problem! No joke :'( <br>  <br>  I'll tell you my story. And, I have no advice sorry, as I am too trying to make friends. Only read if you want to - <br>  <br>  When I was extremely young, I had no great friends. Everyone liked me, but I just didn't bother with anyone, just ran around the school yard alone singing Disney songs (hey, I was a toddler, and I didn’t mind). As I grew older, I developed friends, and was in the popular group (although I wasn't a bully, slapper, etc. I was actually nice to everyone). I started secondary school, making new friends and was once again apart of the popular crew. In the gang, there was six of us, all best friends. But over time, they started developing a taste for the flesh of boys, even though I was thirteen, I didn't give a toss about boys, I was much more interested in education (as corny as it sounds ... I just wanted a good job). The five girls began turning into VERY nasty bullies, they picked on EVERYONE. They changed so much, but I stayed the same, trying desperately hard to keep them the same way. They began to forget about me, on week-ends they would always go out having a blast, I grew sad, because in school they would brag about how amazing it was, with no thought about how I felt. Then they ACTUALLY forgot about me all together, I was just their shadow, watching them leer over anything male related in sight. I felt so alone, but I was worse than this (I can't explain EVERYTHING here, but those are a few points). To be very honest, I didn't care if I was popular or not, I was only in the popular crew because me and those kids were GREAT friends. But, I had no friends then, I decided to look for other people to bother with in school. But the five girls said that I was leaving them! I didn't understand, they wanted me to leave, they hated me. Nonetheless, they got everyone in the school to hate me. Everyone would call me names, such as Snow White, Casper, The Milky Bar Kid (because I am so shockingly pale! Not that I care). Kids would spread rumours, and I occasionally got beaten up everyday, even by kids who are younger or shorter than me. My mother got sick and tired of me "complaining" she just told me to shut up about it, so I had no one in the family (there's bad stuff going in my family too). I have told a few teachers, but each left in disastrous results, I even ended up with a broken arm by a few children. Everyday when I got home, I was so angry with everyone that I would hit myself hard in the skull until I left bruises and I passed out, I would pinch myself until I bled ... Yeah, extreme.<br>  <br>  So, that's my story. Maybe it's pointless, but .... Just telling you that you're not alone. I've done absolutely nothing to them, and this is how I'm treated. But, I've stopped self harming because it's not my fault! When I leave school, I'll never have to see them again, and they'll regret it. It's kind of hard making friends right now, since the plastics have gotten everyone onto me, eh. Who said life was easy? :(|`|naEk1QkSaa	Wow! hard life! U need a GOOD therapist 4 the help ur looking 4 here! That will help!<br>  <br>  Oh yea, I forgot to say u can e-mail me! I'll be any ones friend!! Well almost anyone! I'll be your friend!
BTI0XOptaa	Adults and nymphs are only able to survive for 2-3 days off the host in optimal conditions.Under normal circumstances however this is more likely to be measured in hours rather than days as the adult louse is highly susceptible to dehydration and will quickly starve.Eggs can survive away from the host for up to 7 days but will not hatch without the warmth of a human host.<br>  <br>  Wash upholstery in your car as a precaution, but a nit that falls out attached to a hair needs the warmth of the scalp to hatch. Without this, it will simply die. The chances of it finding its way back to that scalp are minimal.<br>  <br>  With this in mind it is fairly obvious that compulsive cleaning is totally unnecessary.It is more important to make sure there is no live lice on the head than there on furnishings etc.<br>  <br>  Also head lice DO NOT spread like fleas.

They do not fly or jump, these are common myths. <br>  <br>  Feel free to check out the articles at the following sites for more advice.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	parasites rarely leave their host voluntarily.|`|12VQ4ETcaa	Vacuum your upholstery really thoroughly.  You can also kill the eggs by ironing the material.<br>  <br>  Get someone in your family to check your head every day for a few days, and then check theirs just in case.  What you're looking for is either a crawling bug, or eggs close to the scalp.  You can tell them apart from dandruff because lice eggs are kinda sticky and very hard to scrape off the hair.  If you don't see anything after a few days, you're probably fine.|`|UOqOay0yaa	eww|`|6ErVPePEaa	Head lice have no wings, they can only crawl - so transmission comes only from direct contact with other infested people or their belongings. Indirect transmission can occur through sharing personal articles that come in contact with the scalp, such as hats, scarves, hair accessories, headgear, headphones........... fleas jump... Lice will not jump from a persons head to the next.

VM6XG5c3aa	There are success stories.. but right now you are gonna have to take care of yourself...<br>  <br>  1200 calories a day is not enough to remain healthy!!!!<br>  <br>  Under eating affects how our thyroid hormones are made and function. If you are not eating enough thyroid hormone levels will actually DROP!!! that will cause you to be MORE hypo with an even slower metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  It also causes a shift in how thyroid hormone is converted in the body. Normally the body converts the thyroid storage hormone, T4, to the active thyroid hormone, Free T3, which then attaches to T3 hormone receptors.. and allows our bodies to function in a normal and healthy manner.<br>  <br>  When we are skipping meals and under eating the body has to take steps to keep us from starving to death and that is done by dropping the metabolic rate.<br>  <br>  It does this by converting that T4 hormone to Reverse T3 hormone. Reverse T3 blocks T3 hormone receptors. A blocked receptor.. well.. it's like that cell is turned off.<br>  <br>  The more cells and functions that are turned off the less calories the body needs to stay alive.<br>  <br>  It's priority then becomes to conserve calories and MAKE fat, rather than burn it.<br>  <br>  Hormones can get messed up during the challenges of pregnancy that will correct themselves, given proper conditions. It's also possible that you have a thyroid disorder that requires more than just short term help.<br>  <br>  It's important to get a proper diagnosis, a reason for why you are hypo thyroid.. that will then help to determine the best treatment options for you.

A Peptic ulcer pain is of a burning type, felt in the midriff or epigastric region, along with burning sensation behind the chest and acidic regurgitation. It is usually felt early in the mornings i.e. when the stomach is empty and is relieved with taking food, with antacids e.g. Gelusil, Mylanta etc.<br>  Another type of pain associated with an ulcer is that of a stomach ulcer,which gets aggravated by food.<br>  Have you tried taking some antacids and seeing the effects?<br>  Are you into some kind of drugs or medicines?<br>  Are you 'stressed out' or under some mental tension?
ufgv7oTjaa	Well, any OTC sleep medicine could carry a big risk of addiction, so you want to be careful about those. If you'd like, there are popular and effective natural sleep aids that don't have a risk of addiction.<br>  There's Melatonin, Valerian, Chamomile, Hops, L-Tryptophan, L-Theanine, Passionflower, and Scullcap (an herb).<br>  You can try any one of those to help you sleep naturally.<br>  <br>  Also, make sure you avoid sugar, caffeine, and exercise for at least 2-3 hours before you want to head to bed to eliminate other common possibilities of sleeping problems. If none of those help, it's possible you may need to see a Sleep Specialist to see why you aren't sleeping right, but most people don't get to that point after trying some of these options.

But if its really the wall it could be due to a number of things such as rough penetration either from sex or toys sometimes you could get some cuts. You could also have some warts, blisters, or cysts developing. Some of these are caused by std's and cysts are completly normal. You could still to planned parenthood and get an exam done for free with income qualifications.

The problem is suffered by many people, even adults.<br>  <br>  You may want to check with your doctor, to make sure you don't have a UTI (which can sometimes cause temporary incontinence). Even if you don't have the problem during the day, while sleeping it may be more evident.<br>  <br>  Aside from that, you can try Kegel exercises to help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles (which will give you better control over urination).<br>  <br>  Finally, if you are worried about wetting the bed, you can consider wearing some sort of diaper (Goodnights, Depends, etc).

XNc5moJEaa	The pain associated with Scaling and Root Planing really depends on how severe your case is.  Some feel no pain, while others feel minor discomfort.  If you are worried, have them numb you up prior to the treatment. Some are fine without any numbing. Afterward, if your gums feel tender, swish with a warm saltwater rinse.

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|AUOp1j5Saa	It's a possibility but I don't know enough about them to say for sure.<br>  <br>  I've known people who've taken Hoodia and experienced some adverse side effects.<br>  Really, you need to consult a doctor and the websites you bought these pills on. Additionally, you shouldn't be taking Hoodia and Orlistat at the same time.
GsBBhfFHaa	When it comes to weight loss, it doesn't matter which machine you use really, anything that's low level that doesn't labor breathing will allow you to reach metabolic oxidation and start metablozing fat for energy as long as you are doing it long enough which 45 minutes would definitely work. The body takes up fat from all body parts equally when being metabolized so you can't focus on one part. You don't really need to switch from the elliptical, but i'd suggest changing it up every now and then to avoid boredom from repition. The fastest way to build muscle size/strength is using the overload principle (lifting until failure) in the 4 to 6 rep range, but unless you're really looking to gain size in the muscles, i'd suggest 12-15 rep range and doing more sets. I would suggest using more compound exercises that use more muscle groups so go with bench press for chest, triceps, and anterior delts, and lat pulldown/seated row for back, biceps, and posterior delts, and as for legs, squats/seated leg press are both good for hitting the quads, glutes (butt), adductors, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius (calves). Make sure you're giving yourself enough time in between sets to fully recover and never work out the same muscle group on 2 consecutive days. With heavier weights, in the 4-6 rep range, give yourself a 3 day split in order to recover fully meaning 2 days of rest for that particular muscle group, although you should be working out the different muscle groups on alternating days.|`|G1OSlub8aa	You can switch between the elipticasl and bike and stair climber to prevent boredom.<br>  <br>  TIghter butt - squats/lunges<br>  Tighter Thighs - squats/leg extensions/lunges<br>  Tighter hips - adducter/abducter machines to help build muscle<br>  Arms - Dumbbell curls for biceps, Tricep press downs for triceps, dumbbell shoulder press for shoulders.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Wow you are under weight.

Men don't like skinny women.|`|TPTpwarwaa	-it all depends what you like to do, i mean if you feel good about doing your cardio on the elliptical machine-then stay on it. It burns pretty good calories and works your legs good. If you don't like running, the next best thing is to walk on the treadmill about 3.9 or faster and put your incline up to about 7-10%. that really works your mid section great!<br>  -treadmill, stair stepper. i wouldn't really recommend the bike since it doesn't burn many calories and you only work your legs (versus treadmill or elliptical you're working your upper body also)<br>  -If you're unsure what machines to use, they usually have a picture on them to show you which machine to work out on and what muslces they use. if you're at a gym, go when one of the trainers are there, and they should show you the machines for free (since it only takes about 15 minutes) and ask them to go through it when you if they don't, ask any questions-especially about reps and such. Otherwise, you could always ask one of your guy friends who does weights too, they should have some advice.<br>  Also, remember on any cardio machine (especially the elliptical and treadmill) don't hang on to the handles, during any of the time, since you don't burn nearly half as many calories versus hanging on to the handles.

USoqyjaAaa	Not likely because the malaria parasite is not prevalent there.  However the mosquitoes that can spread malaria are present through much of Europe and the United States, areas that are not known for malaria.  Therefore if a person contracted malaria and became ill after returning to the home country, it is theoretically possible for the malaria to be spread to others through mosquitoes, so it is important if this happens during mosquito weather that the patient be protected from mosquito bites.

iSayo0kwaa	Not sure about irreversible damage...<br>  I heard that if a person stops smoking for 5 years, the lungs are able to repair themselves about 50%. <br>  I don't think that one pack a year does such great damage compared to a person who smokes one pack a day, every day for one year.<br>  Still it does do harm.|`|EoroQbCraa	it does do some harm, but not nearly as much as those who smoke a pack a day...etc. you know?  if you stop smoking for 5 years straight, then the lungs have a chance to repair themselves 50% at least.  good luck!|`|kZT828wJaa	That really depends on the individual, but generally speaking, anything is possible. Your lungs can clear out a lot of chemicals and residues from your lungs once you quit smoking, and within a few years your risk of lung cancer will diminish greatly. Unfortunately any damage that you sustain before you quit smoking may be irreversible. Various breathing problems, especially those involving scarring of the tissue in the lungs will permanently reduce your breathing capacity and leave open the possibility of complications.<br>  <br>  If this information is for you or someone else, I could only recommend quitting smoking. No matter what you can't make things worse by quitting, and if you don't quit, you will eventually get complications. Your chances of catching lung cancer are about 1/3, and of those who catch it, the mortality rate is extremely high.(I know there are those who say the risks are all over blown and exaggerated, I heard that song and dance from my dad the whole time I was growing up, and they continued until January, when he died of lung cancer)<br>  <br>  <br>  To the other contributors, just to clarify, when the author of the question wrote "Pack Years" that means on average one pack a day for a year. They do that to measure approximately how much you have smoked. Two packs a day for a year would be two pack years. Half a pack a day for a year would be 1/2 a pack year.

I had to have a minor surgery to get rid of the discharge and to check the ovaries and tubes to make sure there was no more or that none of them had been damaged i was told if it happened again they would have to keep doing the surgery. it was very basic 2 cuts and a scope threw the belly button. You should ask your doctor whats the best option though. when mine ruptured he told me if i hadnt gone to the hospital i would have died i passed out couldnt walk was pale not eating and in lots of pain so please go get it fixed.

947a0dc92dd1bc409cf80a04f33e48e0aa	Look into High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)....search it on the web. It's the best way to do cardio to lose weight, and it's low duration, so it shouldn't negatively affect muscle mass as opposed to long duration cardio. For instance, compare a long distance runner's body to that of a sprinter's body.|`|oUjRZS4haa	To keep your muscle make sure you eat plenty of lean protein like fish and chicken. Cut down on fat and carbs and eat a balanced diet. Try running and swimming, or go to the gym. Its good to do a variation of exercise. You will target different types of fat and keep yourself interested. Good Luck x

I also train in mixed martial arts, and I played four years of football in high school, and played hockey after that.  I always wore a cup.  FYI, all of the professional fighters in the UFC and other organizations wear a cup.  <br>  <br>  Don't feel like you have to force him to wear one.  If he gets his there, he will regret it, and wear one after that.  If he says he has taken shots to the groin, "and can take it" he's lying, or he has some kind of medical problem.  More likely... he's lying.  <br>  <br>  Professional fighters much tougher than him like Matt Hughes and Mirko Cro Cop have dropped to their knees due to groin shots, and they were wearing a steel cup.|`|y2SX4gMfaa	I was heavy into sports (football, wrestling, and boxing) for over 10 years and I only remember taking one serious hit to the groin.  It has nothing to do with "wimpy", as the biggest guys in the gym usually are smart enough to wear one.  For me, I never wore one because they were mostly uncomfortable and hard to maneuver in one.  For ultimate fighting stuff I would definitely wear one.  One too many hits WILL cause damage.

There are a lot of scammers on this site trying to sell that berry. I've never tried it but no drinking it will not cause you to lose weight.

It's not going to stunt her growth or anything like that. But I don't think there's any risk just because of your age. It's going to have the same affects as if she was 33. There's nothing wrong with it.|`|0Y1RbF9gaa	it really has the same effect for adult... you lose brain cells and weed can be the gateway to other strong drugs like Coke or Heroin|`|a340t4XDaa	she can get hurt and die really soon tell your mom or dad to talk to her's|`|IDCNOKbWaa	it will make her hungry, happy and sleepy...just like the rest of us :)

Its the other objects you touch while on way to or inside a restroom that holds more germs than a seat. sinks doors handles paper towel dispenser's faucets light switches, tables etc etc. Think how many times a seat is actually touched if female not much on other hand a male alot when they lift if they do.... So its best to wash your hands every time you go no matter where it is and at times you find you have no water or towels use a hand sanitizer  works just as good.Plenty of germs in a work station than a restroom...|`|sOO93u5Oaa	The only thing I could think of is maybe crabs, but diseases and things like that can't live long on surfaces.

Definitely UTIs you could get, he said.  The bacteria from a UTI can travel from the toilet seat and through your urethra.  If it's not taken care of, you could get a kidney infection.|`|urkNRr5Kaa	I don't like toilet seats at all in public places because for guys most of the time they don't lift the seat and end up urinating all over it.  I don't know why it is so hard to miss the toilet.  <br>  <br>  But, if it bothers you like me most places know have paper seat covers or you can build a nest to put down with toilet paper.  That way you protect yourself.

I took antipsychotics for Tourette's, and sometimes they gave me reactions.  I don't know much about coming off, but their side effects, namely tardive dyskenesia can linger, sometimes permanent.  I've read that coming off Risperdal is hellish.  That there is a lot of agitation and a lot of physical sort of "crash and burn" to it.  Also the symptoms will rapidly reappear, and sometimes I've heard they can actually be worse than before when you stop suddenly.

dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.|`|If2ww2i9aa	It's probally discharge.<br>  Just wear a pad so it wont smell if it really does.|`|tsoc9tihaa	its natural<br>  you can smell it more because its yours and you know its there<br>  spray yourself with perfume to make yourself feel better<br>  but dont worry - all girls have it x|`|PyjZVn28aa	its discharge...but i dont reccommend using scented things down there...it can cause infections....just keep it clean wash it with soap everyday and make sure you get all the soap out...if you dont then it starts itching and thats what starts the infection....also when i use pantiliners it causes me to be itchy...what you are experiancing is very uncomfortable but its either that or being more uncomfortable and itchy...|`|fioNl1k7aa	i have the same problem. my bf had his hand in my pants and when he took it out, it smelled really bad. he was so grossed out, he couldn't finish, this was very embarrassing. now he ask if i washed recently, before he goes near my pants......|`|2861f4b38f22c59d4c2607ae117a9c58aa	No worries.

It's unbelievable.To know a supplement to take to help lubricate your joints, better try search it on google..
CYCIlR7Eaa	A broken toe is very painful. here's some things to do to help. <br>  Swelling that occurs after the injury worsens pain.<br>  <br>  To decrease swelling (and pain), keep the foot raised above the level of the heart as much as possible.Prop the foot up on some pillows. <br>  <br>  Reclining in a chair is also helpful.<br>  Put ice in a plastic bag and apply it to the injury for 15-20 minutes every 1-2 hours. Frozen peas may be used in place of ice. Place a towel between the skin and the bag of ice or frozen peas to protect the skin.<br>  <br>  Let nature take it's course.<br>  Hope this helps.|`|effd7be144beb70d6948e09eb4bfc262aa	i don't think they do. hey should put a ice in a zip lock bag and then wrap that in a towel or wash clothe, wait til it starts getting cold and he should hold it on his toe, 15min on, 15 min off for about and hour. its getting really swollen and the ice will help but you need to do it now not tomorrow, it wont help than.  aside from that try to bandage it together with the toe next to it. stay of it to give it a chance to heal.<br>  i am not a dr. just have had a sister and friend with broken toe and the dr really doesn't do anything but tell you about the ice. when he does use it, he shouldn't wear some big old boots, but loose shoes and walk carefully on it. you don't want to damage it anymore. if any cuts on it, use neosporin.|`|fd7190dbf41367abef107c3ae34b04cbaa	pull it stright and tape it to the next one unless it is broken higher up but just a toe?  gotta tape it just like a finger|`|vszOEaOZaa	very little. make sure it's aligned and maybe a foot brace. not much more than can do with it|`|c55O7jqXaa	Well I have broken toes several times and basically when you go to the ER they take an xray to see where it is broken and if it need to be set they will do that, but if it just a hairline fracture they will just wrap it up and send you on your merry way. Some broken toes require a brace on your foot in order to walk, but I can tell you most you just have to tape up your toes and put on an ace bandage and try to stay up off of it. <br>  <br>  I use to do Martial arts and I just managed to get thru with my broken toes.

If you are girl between the age of about 9 and early 20s and not or minimally sexually active, you should get the vaccine.  Very many sexually active young people carry strains of the humanpapilloma virus. Some (men, especially) don't have any symptoms and they pass it around. Some strains cause genital warts; some strains cause cervical dysplasia and ultimately cancer in women--and unlike with most other cancers these days, many women who get cervical, ovarian, or uterine cancer die from it.
sO13nCh6aa	When they say salt substitute they mean something like Mrs. Dash (or anything else for that matter) that contains Potassium Chloride.  <br>  <br>  Klor-Con is a potassium supplement often given in addition to diuretics that deplete potassium.  If you get too much potassium you could develop hyperkalemia (i.e. too much potassium) and other negative effects.

v8Jw4wRPaa	A smear test checks for cervical abnormalities, and often there will be noticeable abnormalities that point towards an STD if you have one when the smear is sent to a laboratory. It will be particularly noticeable if you have contracted HPV, a virus which can later lead to cervical cancer if allowed to lie dormant in your system for a long period of time.<br>  <br>  Most smear tests nowadays will incorporate an STD check as standard, but you should be certain that your doctor operates by this principle, since some will only check for cancerous or pre-cancerous cells. It's an ideal time to take swabs as you're literally in the perfect position, so it's a good idea to request checks even if you don't think you have an STD, just to know that you're 100% clear on that date.|`|92iuiuZKaa	Nope.

Think about doing something else, like hanging out with friends, going somewhere fun, go for a walk or run, play some sports, play video games, etc...<br>  <br>  Although, there's really nothing wrong with masturbating, at times you will tend to get horny and your hormones will be going crazy.

3WcCeOqdaa	My dentist has been slowly replacing ALL my amalgam fillings with porcelain.  Not only do they match the colour of your teeth but they will not leach into your other teeth like amalgam/silver fillings.  Don't get the silver - get them replaced properly.  Find a new dentist.|`|NLAek2bJaa	Ok, amalgam fillings are perfectly harmless or else they would not have been placed in mouths to begin with. The way they are triturated or mixed, the mercury can not harm you. The amount is so little, it can not be weighed. There has not been one report at all anywhere stating that amalgam fillings will cause you harm and nothing has been reported that anyone has been harmed. I have silver fillings myself and my own dentist. They are the best thing that you can get for several reasons. First, yes they last a really long time. The life of an amalgam fillings can be over 20 years or longer. Composite fillings life only lasts 5-7 years. You will constantly get them replaced. The bonding does not last very long on composites. They can break down and start decay. Amalgam fillings are anti bacterial, decay can not produce under amalgams. They are especially stronger on your back molars because they are used with the most pressure with your chewing. <br>  Most dentists today are more concerned with looks and cosmetics than health. You obviously get white fillings for your front teeth because thats what you see. Your back teeth are better off with amalgam fillings for their strength and less bacteria so they will not have to be replaced. Trust your dentist. He knows what hes talking about.

1Bto3sZeaa	Use Hydrogen Peroxide as mouthwash/gargle daily for a few weeks/months depending on how white you want your teeth.  H.P. is great as a mouthwash and has an effect on tooth enamel similar to any teeth whitening program on the market.  In fact, if you look at the active ingredients in those teeth whitening toothpastes/programs, you'll see Hydrogen Peroxide listed above all else.  It's about $3 per QUART.  Much cheaper than anything else on the market.  You can basically whiten your teeth many shades whiter in about 1 - 2 months time for around $3.  Not bad huh?  Give it a try.  Btw, H.P. has the best germ/disease fighting properties of anything out there as well.  I use it every night.  I wish you luck.  Take care.|`|xBgKqAPHaa	I use a product called Maximum Teeth Whitening . You order it over the internet.

Anyways back to the point dnt worry im 100% certain your bro wont tell because he does it as well and theres no reason to. Parents realise that at the age of 13 and up hormones are raging so they probably already no you relieve yourself through masterbation. If they find out they probably will just laugh about it.

Your brother went through the same thing when he was your age. Guys are at the mercy of their hormones during their teens meaning you will be masturbating more frequently and curious about things like porn. Brothers can sympathize with you more and are more understanding about things like masturbation than parents might be. Masturbating isn't something to be ashamed of so don't feel like you are doing something wrong. Don't feel weird about your brother catching you. Brothers are suppose to talk to their younger brothers about girls, sex, sports all the while imparting their wisdom to help guide you through a confusing time in your development. My friends who had older brothers talked to them about erections, jerking off, porn, sex and how to get away with little things. I saw them in their underwear at times, saw their butts when they mooned us and heard what they have to say about life. Don't stress dude, the worst thing that can happen is your parents talk to you about sex and changes your body will be going through.|`|DibzbnVhaa	I highly doubt he would tell on you, for younger teens is perfectly normal, however, please don't use the living room couch, thats just nasty, people sit there.<br>  If for any reason he tells your parents they will most likely not say anything to you.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|A0lSFMNbaa	Diet and exercise together.<br>  Eat only healthy things; i.e- salads, water, fresh fruits and veggies, etc..<br>  If you feel like you are hungry wait 10 minutes, and if you still feel hungry then eat. <--- This really works.<br>  goodluck!, I trying to lose 45 by July.|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  I have answered this question so many times that I now just copy and paste my story !<br>  <br>  If you want to loose fat, I suggest eating a well balanced diet.<br>  Grilled or baked lean meats, fruits, fiber, vegetables, water and un - salted nuts. <br>  Exercise 5 days of the week, alternating with cardio and strength training.

You either need braces or invisilign.|`|LixIw7bpaa	Expect to pay a lot of money up the *** for a few years...<br>  <br>  Go with braces.|`|3WcCeOqdaa	I'm not entirely sure about surgery.  The idea of braces is so that your teeth and bones move over time.  If they move too quickly, your teeth can end up falling out!  I know in the past that orthodontic work was sped up because people didn't want to wear braces for so long but only time can ensure that when your teeth/bones shift that they will STAY where they shift to.  Otherwise, if it's done too quickly, they will try to move back and your gums/mouth will have no support for your teeth, causing them to loosen and fall out.  My orthodontist told me that my teeth could be straightened in a matter of about 4 months but I wouldn't have them for much longer after that.<br>  <br>  What is the appeal of surgery?  Why do you think this is the solution?  All good things are worth waiting for.  Patience is a virtue.  <br>  <br>  I personally have porcelain braces so it does not always appear I have anything on my teeth.  It makes me more comfortable with them and myself.

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.

If you're experiencing dizziness (or nausea), then you should see a doctor about your headaches.  Dizziness can suggest that you are actually suffering from migraines (not headaches), that  you have neurological problems, etc.<br>  <br>  2. I've never heard of people having their eyes sting with headaches.  Sore eyes, yes.  Stinging eyes, no.  Seems like you should ask a doctor about that too.<br>  <br>  3. You've really given us next to no info regarding your headaches.  What does the pain feel like?  When do they typically occur?  Is it only the back of your head that hurts?  Etc. Without this info, it's hard to give you any kind of definitive cause of your headaches.  I suggest doing some research on the internet.  I'm a headache sufferer myself and I have found the internet to be quite useful in terms of determining my headache type, etc.

Most people don't naturally have the pearly white teeth that everyone desires. The list of reasons for that is: a natural yellowish tooth color, or a discoloration of the teeth that happens for a variety of reasons: smoking, high consumption of caffeine and old age.<br>   <br>   Luckily, nowadays the market is filled with products designed to give you those bright and shiny teeth after only a short treatment. There are homemade treatments, over the counter products and dental whitening treatments that are performed by dentists. The variety is large and can be confusing. So, what are the things that every person who is looking to whiten his or her teeth should know?<br>   <br>   <br>   1. Budget - make sure you know your budget limits. Ideally, everyone would go to the dentist to have their teeth whitened, but it can be pricy, and sometimes you can achieve great results with a much smaller investment. However, some teeth bleaching products are known for providing unsatisfactory results more often than not. One such product is teeth strips, which will sometimes whiten only parts of your teeth and leave uneven spots of your previous teeth color.<br>   <br>   2. Dental Crowns, dentures, veneers and teeth implants - teeth whitening products will not whiten anything but your natural teeth, so if the majority the teeth you want whitened are crowns or implants, then the whitening process will only cause your discolored teeth to stick out more from between the white teeth.<br>   <br>   3. Dental Pain, gum and teeth sensitivity - these are common side effects of most teeth whitening treatments, and should pass within a couple of days. However, for this reason, people who suffer from gingivitis (gum inflammation) shouldn't bleach their teeth.<br>   <br>   4. Homemade dental bleaching - these solutions can seriously damage your teeth. Among these solutions are: strawberries, lemon juice and baking soda. These treatments can ruin the tooth enamel.<br>   <br>   So, when you are looking for a teeth bleaching product, make sure you consider all the elements involved, so that you'll be able to fully enjoy the result!<br>   By: Hill<br>   Other Blog Reviews<br>   ?Chicago Solution Dental Teeth Whitening<br>   <br>   Teeth whitening product reviews | At Home Tooth Whitening<br>   <br>   Whitening strips and professional treatments aren’t the only ways to keep your teeth...???Read more...<br>   <br>   <br>   <br>   My review is awesome! | renaissanceinitiative.org<br>   <br>   To be honest I am not really sure.

Some want the child's member to look like dad's<br>  3.  When circumcised, there is less hygienic maintenance required<br>  <br>  As an aside, recent studies have found that in people are having unprotected sex, the transmission of HIV is significantly lower in circumcised males.  This is certainly not "safe sex," but in populations where other measures are not being taken, the infection rates are considerably lower in those who are circumcised.|`|iZDsMCghaa	I agree. I see nothing necessary about it but I think some people do it to protect their kids from that stigma that can sometimes come with being uncut. I know lots of people like to say its dirty and leave you disease prone but all you have to do is , whats that word, ohhhh yeeeaahhh, bathe!<br>  Pulling the foreskin back is no different than a woman having to clean around her "lips". Should we get cut,too? Im glad I had that choice. Plus, being uncut offers more sensitivity to the man.<br>  <br>  MICHEALD, your hilarious! I dont thing men who arent circumcised pee on themselves and do you really think they have trouble having sex? hahaha|`|rIFqv8nvaa	There are benefits.

iK3YYRaTaa	One to six grams of cinnamon, daily for 40 days, reduces fasting blood glucose by 18-29%, triglycerides by 23-30%, LDL-cholesterol by 7-27%, and total cholesterol by 12-26%. There was no 'dose-effect'; thus it's not known if less than 1 gram a day would be equally beneficial. The changes persisted, largely, for 20 days after the patients had stopped taking extra cinnamon.<br>  <br>  How does cinnamon work in this way? That remains to be determined. It's likely that somehow there's an increased sensitivity to insulin. And cinnamon also has antioxidant properties.<br>  <br>  Read this study:<a href="http://www.healthandage.com/public/health-center/1/article/2812/Take-Cinnamon-for-Diabetes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthandage.com/public/healt...</a>|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Unfortunately all the hype was disproven, but if it's working for you, I suppose it's harmless.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-research/summaries/baker-cinnamon-has-no-benefit-for-people-with-diabetes.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-researc...</a>|`|aW59AbDaaa	I don't think it's particularly appropriate to quote a single small study that is six years old now and has been largely discredited.  Cinnamon may have some small but measurable beneficial effects for diabetics.  It sounds as if you are one with a positive experience.  If so, that's great.  No one knows why cinnamon improves blood sugar readings, but if it works for you it's a better alternative than a lot of the approved medications.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to an article that is more skeptical about the benefits of cinnamon:<br>  <br>  "After examining the final fasting blood glucose, A1C levels, and lipid levels, researchers found that cinnamon had no real effect on people with diabetes. The type of diabetes, type 1 or type 2, did not matter."
B1COLthhaa	You have DID (dissociative identity disorder) ..you need to seek help for it. Usually this occurs when you've been abused, have you? Although there are alternative reasons to explain it as well, like external influences. Keep a white board handy and try to talk to your other person on it. It's been psychologically proven that this method works.|`|CadIYXdXaa	You really should try to find professional help, there may be free counselors or support groups out there that can help. It sounds like you need to bridge the gap between yourself and "skinz" and merge them into one person.
dLFpdOndaa	You need to develop explosive power from your legs and strengthen your core.<br>  <br>  1. Jump rope<br>   <br>  2. Deep-knee-bend squats. If you have never done a squat workout before, then start very light. This exercise will quickly build power and explosiveness in your legs. <br>  <br>  3. Do some deep-knee-bend jumps. Bend down quickly with your back straight and explode up. Once your feet touch the ground, immediately explode up again. Do this as many times as you can for one set. Rest and get your breath back, then do another set. <br>  <br>  4. Jumping high is not only about leg strength. Core body strength can really increase your jumping ability. Crunches will strengthen your stomach and improve your vertical height. <br>  <br>  5. Strengthen your calf muscles with toe raises. You have already worked on your upper legs, so complete your ability to explode into a high jump by exercising your calves.

4DAOhKFLaa	If they don't burn/itch then it's probably not from shaving. It could be an allergic reaction to the laundry detergent you use, which would show up in areas of friction of clothing against skin, like your thighs.<br>  <br>  Or, it could be keratosis pilaris, a minor skin condition that causes small, pimple-like bumps on mostly thighs and the backs of arms. This is probably what it is. I had this in high school, and never figured out what it was or how to get rid of it. I was buying DermaDoctor's "KP Duty" cream and body scrub and it worked wonders, BUT it was pricey. Then, I figured out that if you use regular body scrub (from Wal Mart or wherever) and rub it in in the shower, rinse off, and put lotion on the area when you get out, you get the same effect of using the expensive stuff.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0Uv2LiILaa	You need to moisturize.

AOCqOTfBaa	Hi Mia333,<br>  <br>  Five days will be pretty hard for you to gain musle, but if you could give it more time<br>  <br>  Incline Pushups on Smith Machine: <br>  Set the smith machine bar at chest height. Stand about 2-3 feet away from the bar. Lean forward and grab the bar with an overhand grip. Keep the balls of your feet on the ground and lower your chest to the bar.<br>  <br>  Do 3 sets of 8 repetitions per workout.<br>  <br>  Each workout, lower the bar one notch on the Smith Machine until you get to the lowest rung. You're almost at full pushups now!<br>  <br>  Push up Holds: <br>  But you still might not be able to do more than 1 or 2. So let's get stronger where we are weaker - at the bottom.<br>  <br>  From the top of the pushup position, lower your body slowly (for 2 seconds) to the bottom position.<br>  <br>  Hold this position for 5 seconds.<br>  <br>  Then slowly lower your body all the way to the floor, drop to your knees and then get back up to the full pushup position.<br>  <br>  Do 3 sets of 3 repetitions of the 5 second hold.<br>  <br>  Add 1 repetition each workout until you are up to 3 sets of 6. By now, you should be able to crank out quite a few pushups. Have fun and don't beat anyone up with your new musles!|`|AA12116167	I have never been able to do a push-up either, and I am pretty well fit. The main thing that you probably lack are triceps and chest muscles. Do tricep curls, or try this: find a chair or bench and and squat down in front of it like you might sit in it, but in front of it instead. Grab the edge of the chair with your hands (thumbs on top, fingers on bottom) and lower and raise yourself by pushing up and down with your triceps. (You will be sitting down past the front of the chair and raising yourself back up). This is a good exercise to do if you don't have weights. <br>  I really don't know if you will be able to do a full push-up in five days though! It takes time to build muscle, and you might just find you are incredibly sore by the time you have to do it and can not even do a knee-push-up. <br>  I don't think it is fair for them to expect everyone to be able to do a push-up. Maybe they will cut you a break and let you do knee-push-ups instead :)|`|3WcCeOqdaa	Start with doing push-ups on your knees until your chest and triceps get stronger.  You will be able to do these more easily and do more of them.  Each day, always TRY to do one full regular push-up.  Try the "log" - support your entire body on your flag hands and toes, like you are ready to lower yourself down to do a push-up.  Strengthing like this will help... and eventually you'll be able to lower your body AND bring it back up - voila!  A push-up! <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TSKKKeftaa	everyday lift weights<br>  go to walmart and get 5-8 pounds<br>  do bicep curls, and overhead tricep lifts do 15, 3 sets for each<br>  also do the plank, it works arms and core<br>  <br>  for the push up get on all four(hands and knees) and start off with 5, 3 sets<br>  start of slow and work up do it 3 times a day<br>  <br>  it'll hurt and suck realll bad but it'll work<br>  <br>  good luck!!<br>  <br>  answer mine please?!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuMyn9IbIHGvjaRTCTEQ9.jAFQx.;_ylv=3?qid=20090226121103AA5jU7b">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|pXX2ophFaa	Take some steroids they taste good and show mucho gain in muscle size.

You would be better off adding fruit to the plain kind.|`|iZDsMCghaa	The fruity yogurt is loaded with sugar. Its like having two fruit roll ups. Its better to have plain yogurt and add fresh berries.|`|clTSDRy1aa	Targetted weight reduction is quite tough, many people would state impossible, however the one diet that clearly delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I shed 20 pounds, it clearly does produce results!
01kEv36Faa	Once your muscles are toned and strong they shouldnt be sore when you work out.  The soreness comes from stiff underdeveloped muscles.  The more you work out the larger and stronger the muscle becomes.  Why do you think that someone with well developed muscles can pick up something heavy without effort?  Straining the muscle doesnt develop it, just gives you muscle strain|`|niZBsn9Qaa	that's easy. You're body has adapted to your fitness level. If you want to feel it, push yourself more. Increase intensity, weight, reps, sets, speed, anything you can do to kick it up a notch.<br>  <br>  Remember, the body will tell you when its being challenged, thus muscle soreness (your muscles breaking down and repairing themselves...which is a good thing) so if you're not feeling it anymore, your body is bored.<br>  <br>  CHALLENGE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)|`|3a4o2e9Naa	its cuz you have been doing it for 1 year right for a long time so there for you are going to get stronger like your muscles so why would they|`|e1d72ae6e85a1760fd4cf02521c6d9b7aa	It depends on why you're sore. Muscle soreness can also related to lactic acid build up in your muscles.  As you get fitter and increase your lung capacity, you build up less lactic acid when you work out.  <br>  <br>  Or, you could be ready to up your weight.  Try using 8 lb weights where you usually use 5 lb weights, etc.  <br>  <br>  Also, talk to the instructors.  After 5 years, they probably recognize you.  They may be able to give you variations on each exercise that will make them more challenging.|`|jKBQgwEqaa	well have u been doing the same workout for 5 years? if so u need 2 change it. ur body gets used 2 the same thing when ur at the gym and u need 2 change ur workout|`|5f128396df7759d37e252f9ad5e76f75aa	It's possible you need to challenge yourself more - increase reps, increase weight or try a new cardio routine.
AA12058427	man i tried a lot of different pre work out drinks over the last few years.  Ive been taking superpump 250 for over a year now.  I probably dont get quite the same rush as i did when i first started taking it, but i still love it.  Ive kinda settled on two scoops before each workout.  i think it has a lot more beneficial ingredients than something like NO Explode which is basically a caffeine/ sugar rush.<br>  <br>  Check on amazon.com or something, its usually quite a bit cheaper than going to GNC or another supplement store.|`|G1OSlub8aa	its a nitric oxide delivery system, you will have longer more sustained and bigger pumps with your workouts.
5rJ6nf2oaa	Well you will certainly be better off without all that sugar, but the rest of your diet will determine whether or not you can lose weight and be healthy in general. Look at the amount of animal fats, additives and processed food that is in your diet and that will answer your question.
W3bUPSGlaa	Being a virgin can be a plus.<br>  <br>  Being ignorant of sex would be unacceptable though. There are many avenues of education that don't involve penetration - including literature or actual physical intimacy to a certain point.<br>  <br>  If you are a girl, it is a huge plus, unless you're dealing with a guy who places such small value on this important part of living that they rather be with someone "pre-equipped and experienced" than to share and grow with you in your relationship.<br>  <br>  For a guy, it's a mixed bag, NEVER TELL beforehand (there's a risk of being categorically rejected by close-minded people), but practice and read up on how to perform well. Don't be one of those brainless idiots who gasses out in 5 seconds the first time. Make sure it's something to be remembered, and not just by you.|`|MXRXG62oaa	well i was a virgin till about a week ago ( i know, i technically should answer this).... i think its a sign of strength (sorry herhuggybunny)<br>  i think it shows that you respect yourself and your body. i think it is a very honorable decision especially living in todays sex-obsessed culture.... i never felt like an outcast, i always felt proud of myself that i waited for my husband-to-be. And likewise, hes happy that he waited for me. He has never kissed another girl, and ive never kissed another guy. Its so sweet/fairy-tale/and romantic, and i wouldnt have it any other way.<br>  Not only is he the best ive ever had, hes the only. Why compare? Its so specialy to have only seen one boy/girl naked in your whole life. <br>  <br>  Now i think its fine to have sex before marriage as long as you marry that person..thats just my opinion though<br>  <br>   you only live once.... so why have regrets? save it for someone you love and who truly loves you back :)|`|kNluf8ohaa	Well it depends how old you are lol, I am 13 and proudly a virgin.

Don't be involved at all|`|b7vYsbYNaa	the fact that your even concerned about this eating disorder is a sign you dont have it right now..its called attention seeking....people who have it dont know they have it they deny it...dont feel bad about eating i think everyone goes through spells of that kind of thinking i did and lost alot of weight but it also made me very ill and now i am healthy again...seriously if you get any worse talk to friend and a doctor...:) hope you get better..:)|`|gb4beCZTaa	i wwant to too... i hate bullying.... i was pretty much the center of bullying when i was smaller.... and i wanna be anorexic too.....
xfgVGqvXaa	When I answered your other question, I hope I didn't make you worry that you had an eating disorder!<br>  <br>  I think the important thing is to stay within the "normal" weight band.  I don't want to be overweight and I don't want to be underweight.  If I was near the top of the "normal" band (which I am) I would try to eat a bit less.  I was near the bottom, I would try to eat a bit more.<br>  <br>  You are in that "normal" band, so I don't think you have much to worry about.  Don't worry about having an eating disorder, and don't worry about gaining weight.  Just weigh yourself occasionally to make sure you aren't going too far in one direction or the other.|`|AA12093442	no<br>  just means you eat smart and am healthy<br>  you cannot be classified under the eating disorder categories|`|mQ02xLwXaa	Not really unless you become underweight because of it|`|vEv2YwWdaa	That is strange.  You are just fishing for attention.  You have a mental disorder.|`|0kIkCagPaa	I know exactly how you feel im the exact same way and no its not an eating disorder, alot of people are like that.

The best way to tell is if it interferes with a normal way of living...for example you should not feel anxiety when eating, or you may not be eating enough to keep you nourished.<br>  <br>  As a rule, thoughts of food should not occupy too much of your time. If it does, then you should consider whether or not things have got out of hand! Because even if it isn't harmful NOW things are likely to get much worse over time, and that is when it can destroy your life. and become far more difficult to get out of. <br>  <br>  Only you can be honest with yourself though! Deep down I believe you think you might, since you ask this question. So please be careful, and take care of yourself by seeking help. Remember you are very precious! And you are loved.|`|ChmuSKpVaa	no, it just means that you like how you look. good luck though.
yFJDkZANaa	Ok well done for taking this to alot of thought cos most girls just rush into it without thinking twice and regret it after. <br>  As for waxing if it's your first time removing your pubic hair NO it will hurt loads if he won't mind why not just trim a bit down there if you want shave just take a hot bath that will open up the pores and lather up loads of shaving cream and shave personally for me i always put conditioner on afterwards to stop itching and rashes.<br>  Stretch marks i'm sure he won't notice all men are bothered about is having sex not looking at your stretch marks i know how you feel hun cos i used to have lots on my hips and i was self-conscious but my ex-boyfriend took no notice of it. <br>  Well what about trying contact lenses??<br>  If you can, do it during the day but make sure you are relaxed don't rush into things. Use lots of lube it will make things easier! Good Luck xxxxxxx|`|BIg5bWkMaa	wax or shave don't scare him away.....if he loves you those wont turn him off and most guys arent bothered by them at all....do what ever makes you comfortable with your glasses my personal experience take them off they get in the way but then again thats why i got contacts.....Make your first time memorable go crazy have sex in his car or yours or if it makes you happier and more comfortable to it when your parents are gone if its his first time chances are he wont last long enough to get caught anyways.|`|lSoNAOoOaa	don't do that..|`|dpgXzMenaa	Don't wax... stretch marks don't matter, and you might wanna get rid of your glasses if the sex gets really vigorous, but they won't be in much the way otherwise.<br>  <br>  For some girls, it hurts a lot... for others, only a little... for still others, it doesn't hurt at all. Same with bleeding... and there's no way to really know which it's going to be for you until it happens.<br>  <br>  You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following... and if you're not comfortable with *all* of it, you're probably not ready, no matter what age you are:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex should be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy of openly sharing your bodies and their reactions without shame... because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|HIO0yvK0aa	1- it's going to bed very painful? and for all you know he won't mind?<br>  2- stretch marks? errr nooo, if he loves you then he isn't going to care about the odd stretch mark.<br>  3- he may think it kinda sexy if u wear something that goes with your glasses, for all you know they could be a turnon for him, but if your really that against them, you could get contact lenses.<br>  <br>  you need to sneak around to have sex with your boyfriend? as for location book a night away at a hotel or B&B or something?<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|tFoSy2YRaa	1) Don't feel pressured to wax it all off, but definitely make sure its tidy and clean, you'll feel more confident anyway. But don't leave it until last minute, or you might have red bumps or something.<br>  2) No - he loves you and he'll be so happy about this, he won't care.<br>  3) Yeah, take them off. They might get broken! Touch is more important than sight during sex, especially for a girl!<br>  <br>  4) I'm not sure exactly, but don't take any chances of being walked in on. Are your parents really strict, or don't they like your boyfriend, or don't they believe in sex before marriage? I would suggest talking to your mum, explaining why you're ready. But if you truly know you are and you love him don't tell them if it will just cause trouble.|`|7Kmmqy32aa	Well if your comfortable with doing it i find shaving is much better than waxing, using a bikini razor is much more easier but it doesnt really matter.. just leave the stretch marks but if you are concious of them you can use bio oil or vitamin E capsules rub this on 2x a day and they should go away in 3-4 month.. just wear your glasses and then see what happens and were be spontaneous!!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|rhHgrohdaa	Do NOT do it.|`|jvLNWFPjaa	don't know, I'm still a virgin|`|AA11193401	no wax<br>  no<br>  leave them on<br>  that will work

sR7jM0UCaa	In my opinion I don't think it is ever "deserved". That's why it's called abuse. <br>  I've met people like him. I can't quite say what it is but there's just something not right about them. I might be wrong but he sounds like he's messing with your mind just because he doesn't want to get the blame or get involved with the authority.<br>  <br>  There must be another way to solve their problem - other than beating her. I don't think that's right at all. Is he okay? I mean, mentally stable?<br>  <br>  You've only heard his side of the story, what about his wife?|`|TdqeC0vmaa	Their is never a deserved reason to be abused. No one has a right to emotionally or phsysically hurt someone else.<br>  <br>  IF , and usually this has more to do with the paranoia and or insecurity of the abuser than with any facts, the person they are with is bad untrustworthy manipulative mean and awful..... why on earth would you stay with them?<br>  <br>  If someone was treating you badly being a cheater untrustworthy manipulative then they obviously do not love you and no amount of head bashing is going to make them love you anymore.... what it may do... which is exactly what the person who abuses wants.... is make someone who the abuser is terrified is too good for them ...too beautiful ...too smart... too independent... to ever really love them feel so terrible bad and pathetic about themselves that they will never go away because they think no one will love them and they deserve to be hit. <br>  <br>  Its NEVER a two way street unless their beating the crap out of each other. Abuse is never justified. It is the act of a coward with low self esteem. Terrified that every woman will only hurt them paranoid and so fearful their partner is better than they are and so will eventually leave that rather than risk equal trust and love they'd rather beat their partner mentally and physically to a point where they are totally submissive slaves giving fear rather than love just so they wont ever go away. <br>  <br>  Abusers are small and pathetic. And trying to rationalize it to you is the same manipulation they use to make their abused partner beleive it is really their fault and that they deserve nothing better. Dont fall for it!|`|ufweP4wdaa	no it is not deserved & please do not allow anyone make you believe that it is.If his wife is that horrible to him what is he still doing there but the same question goes to her why is she still there. everyone has a choice & it is sad to think that the power a person has on another is disgraceful. eventually either the husband or the wife will build up the courage to walk out as this is not always easy. it took me seven years to leave my ex-husband that is when the physical abuse stopped.|`|AjH5MqtVaa	No she does not deserve to be abused!  You should not buy into his manipulation of the facts.  The fact is that everything that he is doing to her is illegal.  Don't you think he is trying to make a pass at you?

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|TiUkZEUiaa	stop eating and run like five miles a day 3 times a week|`|b8e2bc9f3753405233ebcc96825942cdaa	A friend of mine lost 20,000 pounds in just one year.

qMVOV9t4aa	Yeah lack of oxygen or blood to the brain would do that. Nothing a little exercise wouldn't fix.|`|ieHKqlGMaa	It could have been a sudden drop in bp (blood pressure).

m1Yr8EMAaa	Ok, first go to oxygenmag.com. It is for women and has all the answers you will ever need. Second I love how people say they carry their weight very well.

You just think you carry it well.|`|t9H3fQPoaa	I would see the doctor. before you start any diet or exercise, as you want to lose a lot of weight. but healthy eating is easier that you think. have plenty of fruit and veg and drink water. and your doc should be able to give you a list of local classes, and a diet sheet. but maybe you could do your work outs with your sister or your husband.<br>  Good luck in losing weight kept at it, and you will do well and be a size 8 before you know it.|`|OtDms9wEaa	Well first of all, a size 8 is not 125 lbs. I weigh 108+/- and wear a size 0/00 now, but I used to weigh 125 - 130 and I wore a 5. If you are 5'8", you should not want to lose that much weight, especially since you say you are healthy and carry it well. If your sister is 5'9" and she wears a 6, then she is probably too thin. I am too thin and I try very hard to put weight on, so I try to inform people that there are many negatives that go along with being very thin.<br>  Eat well, walk often, strech, take vitamins and supplements and try yoga|`|TEeX06WWaa	i found the information here

ETbb9BfSaa	Cardiovascular exercise along with proper diet and nutritional habits will certainly help you lose the fat around your stomach. Generally, cutting the amount of calories you take in throughout the day, along with proper supplements for your body and your goals would most likely be your best choice here to achieve the goals you're looking at.<br>  <br>  Abdominal exercises with strengthen the muscles in your stomach so they're more toned and stronger. Take a look around on the internet for some fun abdominal exercises that you like (doing sit ups can get boring after a while). Be sure to mix up your cardio exercises as well, since doing the same thing over and over can lead to burn out if you're not enjoying your normal activity.|`|7XidY1QGaa	Your best bet is cardio.  Everyone has muscles all over the body- you just have to work off the fat (even the small amount) around them so they will show.<br>  <br>  You might need more than 30 situps a day but you can always build up; maybe try 30 on Monday, 40 on Tuesday and so on.

You'l also replace energy stores that have been burned off.|`|G1OSlub8aa	When you get home from the gym you can eat the sandwich|`|3WcCeOqdaa	I think it's best to eat immediately after working out.

UZJ7wVc8aa	The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise. If this seems confusing, you can get a free personalized workout routine at <a href="http://shtrainer.com" rel="nofollow">http://shtrainer.com</a>|`|Du8QhOmaaa	first i would start walking on a treadmill.

But a chocolate diet isn't healthy.  Why not see a nutritionist to find healthier foods to bulk up with.|`|NLAek2bJaa	First of all, eating chocolate every half an hour is very unhealthy even if you are trying to gain weight. There are other means to gain weight that are more healthy for you. <br>  Anyways... chocolate and sweets are not the only things that ruin your teeth. Food in general will cause tooth decay. But, in general, if you brush your teeth after eating will help your teeth from bacteria and food being stuck all day. It is still a good habit to get into, because your teeth will always be clean and prevent decay.|`|E8gGr83Waa	It could help but some people like myself have teeth that are prone to cavaties. Mine are deep ridged and the dentist uses a sealer on mine to protect against cavities. My son never brushes his teeth but like twice a week and he has no cavaties but his teeth are different than mine. I brush alot and I would still get  cavaties. So ask your dentist and also ask for a sealant to be put on your teeth. its like a coating. it really helps. to answer your question i dont think it hurts to brush straight after at all. Just use a soft toothbrush so you dont injure your gums.

There are 2 types of diabetes Type 1 (juvenile-this is where the pancreas doesn't make any insulin requiring daily injections) Type 2 (adult-the body makes some insulin. This type can sometimes manage with just diet and exercise others take oral meds and sometimes shots).  Both types must manage with diet, exercise, and testing blood sugar. Alot of people think that diabetes is caused from eating to many sweets and this isn't true. Causes can be contributed to weight, diet, family history and they have even done studies and have linked it to a virus.  There is no cure, but they have made advancements in treatment (ex: insulin pumps, glucometers, humulin insulin etc.....).<br>  I hope this gives you some ideas.

3KyVMVncaa	Well, that depends on how large the cavities are. Yes, you are right about the front and they will be coming out soon but, a cavity can double in size in only 6 months. I think you should definitely have his molars fixed seeing as he wont be losing them for quite sometime. I would make an appointment for those to be done and at the visit ask your dentist if the front ones are 100% necessary. If your dentist wont explain your sons situation or tries to push you in any way I would change dentists.<br>  Don't worry about your son becoming "dental phobic" as long as you tell him its going to be a nice visit to get the "buggies" out of his mouth, he should be fine. Pretty much all kids who freak out at the dentist, is because the parents have told them bad things or made fun of them for having to go. He will be fine. Good luck!|`|4CgYIHWYaa	I had a filling when I was about 5 and it scared the hell out of me and I then started a phobia of dentist . Im pretty sure it was me feeling the filling and not injection even though he thought it would be best. When i needed a filling i didn't get one and my teeth decayed, i had 3 decayed teeth removed, so if you leave it this could happen. My baby teeth never all fell out naturally and i had to get them pulled out before a brace so they may not fall out and molars tend to stay along longer but for the front teeth they come out easier.|`|OxoumjYJaa	Well if the dentist told you that he wants to fill them then it should be finebut otherwize he'll have to use Silver since they are going to fall out soon.|`|af3a28b07826dce8ecfc28a5eaa91e13aa	It depends on how long till they fall out. A person's health can be affected by bad teeth. If the cavities get too big they can cause pain as well. It's a decision only you can make.
wDtA9hrhaa	You are deffiently anorexic. And i must tell you the binges do stop! I binged a lot too, b/c i could only eat 500 calories, and would end up binging very very bad. The only way i got to stop was to just tell my self i i feel so much better when i eat and have more energy. I don't want to live life obsessed with food. Food is good. The binges will stop after you stop starving yourself trust me.
Y3ghamr7aa	Just chew slowly and enjoy what you are eating<br>  I used to eat fast too, then i started to chewing slower and taking smaller pieces of food at a time|`|BH7VpjJNaa	Eating quickly can lead to weight gain because you don't give yourself time to feel full.

I have taken Nexium and can say for a fact that the Prilosec is just as good in reducing the discomfort of Gerd and acid reflux. You might try the small size, the 14 day box of Prilosec.You may have to ask at the cash register, if it is not on the shelf, people are beginning to steal it, and now the drugstores have to keep it under glass. I would ask your Doctor about Prilosec and if you can try it. Also you do not have to wait to take the Aciphex. But in case of doubt, again, ask your doctor.<br>  To raise the head of your bed, get two cement blocks, and put the top of the bed on the blocks. Don't eat or drink after six O'Clock.

gr4IFLsMaa	I really don't know for sure, but I know if you stop taking the medication, the symptoms could return so it's advised not to discontinue a medication without doctor's approval.  Also medications like Abilify and Geodon have to be stopped gradually and not "cold turkey".  You can suffer withdrawals.  I know.  I've been there with stopping Abilify too quickly.  (discontinued Abilify due to side effects).  I would think that Abilify and Geodon are more of long term medications rather than as needed medications.  That's all I can really say on the subject, but best to speak with the doctor.  They have more knowledge than a yahoo answer person.  Best of luck.
JwecpnBVaa	well it would maybe work, but it wouldn't be good for you, and that is a very small maybe.<br>  <br>  think about it, if you fill you body with fats and carbs and high calorie foods, its going to be very difficult to burn them off.

AA12095483	I don't understand your question - what do you mean by 'that could be done with athlete?"<br>  Do you mean how many pushups can an athlete do?

GGmaSpHDaa	Lifting weights will not hinder your growth. This is just an unfortunate myth that keeps being repeated. <br>  <br>  Doctors recommend strength training for youth.  It improves athletic performance and helps prevent injury. <br>  <br>  Various medical websites have articles on this.  For example, see the following statement linked from the Cleveland Clinic: <br>  <br>  “Despite the previously held belief that strength training was unsafe and ineffective for children, health organizations such as the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the National Strength and Conditioning Association (NSCA) now "support children's participation in appropriately designed and competently supervised strength training programs."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/strengthtrainingforyoung.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.infosports.com/clvclinic/stre...</a><br>  <br>  NSCA position on resistance training for youth.<br>  <a href="https://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/YouthforWeb.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://www.nsca-lift.org/Publications/Y...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/download/Youth%20Hot%20Topics.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.nsca-lift.org/HotTopic/downlo...</a><br>  <br>  While you won’t stunt your growth lifting weights, you can be injured.  It is very important to get instruction in proper lifting technique.  If you don’t have an adult to instruct you, get this book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Strength-Power-Young-Athletes-Faigenbaum/dp/0736002189/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225944504&sr=1-3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Strength-Power-You...</a>|`|pQNwuyuvaa	it has an definite impact on your growth ...weight lifting is recommended  after 20's where  you dnt grow much after that|`|t81MEJ82aa	That's a myth. It's not like your body knows that in 90 days you will be 17 and stop growing at that day. The best way to ensure you reach your maximum potential is to be healthy and have strong bones like weight lifting helps you achieve.

In simple terms, you are what you eat.  Your body needs Energy (calories or Kilojoules) to support itself and if you eat more than what your body needs, it will be stored as fat.  Weight loss can only occur if you eat less than what your body needs.  But please note, weight loss is not necessary FAT loss.  To lose fat you need to exercise too.  Diet alone will reduce your weight in the form of little fat and also muscle tissue but when combined by the right exercise, you will not lose muscle mass but only FAT.<br>  <br>  Brisk walking is a very good exercise.  Do this at least 30min 3 times a week.  Try and avoid processed food high in sugar and saturated fat. <br>  Sugar has high calories and fat is already in a form that can be easily absorbed into your body.  Not all fat is bad, only saturated fat increases your cholesterol (LDL), and that can lead to coronary diseases.|`|3353iGfJaa	Hey, I've known worse. DO NOT STOP EATING!!! It worsens your dieting.

You'll gain weight from eating too much and exercising too little.<br>  <br>  If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories. You can find some more information at the Beginner's Guide to Dieting - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a>|`|n7KCez59aa	Hi !<br>  <br>  No, you will not gain weight if you sleep during the afternoon.<br>  <br>  I have answered this question so many times that I now just copy and paste my story !<br>  <br>  If you want to loose fat, I suggest eating a well balanced diet.<br>  Grilled or baked lean meats, fruits, fiber, vegetables, water and un - salted nuts. <br>  Exercise 5 days of the week, alternating with cardio and strength training. Do not cross out anything from your " diet", save the 2 days that you do not work out for being able to eat junk foods. You will not over indulge, after 2 weeks of eating a well balanced diet, on the 2 off days you have, you will not want as much junk food. <br>  <br>  I lost 105 pounds in 1 year by eating this this way.

If you loose more than 1or 2 pounds/week you are probably loosing only water weight or you're starving yourself and the weight will come right back. That still means you could loose 20-25 pounds safely and healthfully!<br>  <br>  Find a calorie controlled diet that you like.  Weight Watchers, South Beach, pretty much anything will work as long as you control your calorie intake and get enough vitamins and minerals. You should have a consultation with a nutritionist to find out how many calories per day you need.<br>  <br>  Get into an exercise routine that you can stick with. No matter how much weight you loose, you'll look better if your muscles are toned.<br>  <br>  Don't focus on being skinny for a vacation as your ultimate goal.

nmozvlGPaa	Diabetes is a silent killer.  So is high blood pressure.  She absolutely should get a full medical checkup.  She can save a few bucks, but she could die doing it.<br>  <br>  Both diabetes and high blood pressure are usually linked to obesity.  If your Mom is obese and 'apple' shaped - fat in the abdomen, then it is very possible that she has sleep apnea.  This means she stops breathing when asleep and the body must wake up to prevent death.  This means her sleep is of poor quality and if she falls asleep as soon as she is quiet for a minute or two, it is a strong indicator of that.  <br>  <br>  sleep apnea also raises blood pressure and can people can die from it!  Reggie White, the famous football player died from it.  They make machines that help you breathe at  night and many sufferers of apnea are helped greatly by the machine...<br>  <br>  Please convince her to see a doctor ASAP.  Make the appointment yourself and even offer to pay. <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	mother need a complete medical check up   sound like the first stage of alsiemers  diease ...|`|wO8yECYqaa	i don't quite know what other things this might be, but if she can't afford it, why don't you try taking her? if you can't afford it, then maybe work some over time? or get a job if you have one, i don't think i can offer much advice though sorry, i hope your mom feels better soon!|`|qyDvwd8Vaa	she could be going through the change it can  affect women in all different ways my poor mother was all over the place and her memory still isnt great try your best to get her to go see her doctor a bit of hrt(hormone replacement teraphy) might do her good good luck
bhvW1nMbaa	I had this problem in middle school. <br>  my teacher told the councilor who called my parents. I don't know if they have to tell in high school.<br>  you might want to consider talking to a local pastor or someone like that. but since you want to talk about it, you're on the right track. i can totally understand you not wanting your parents to know. but you might want to go ahead and talk to the councilor or inquire about how much they can keep secret before telling your parents.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck,<br>  Lola.|`|tdqD9DcSaa	I think that the self-injury in your case is linked to a emotional problem that could be from emotional pain somewhere in your life. You hide your scars so not to drawl attention to you, you lie to people that care about you protect them but also so you don't have to deal with the attention of people knowing, and you wish you could tell them that you were self-injuring. As for telling a teacher or councilor that you self-injure, it is the law that if a teacher comes into contact with a student that is being abused, suicidal, or self-injuring they have to report it to the school councilor and then from there contact the proper people to get you help (in your case your parents). I will suggest that you do need to get help and that if you are unsure of what to do talk to your councilor and have a family meeting set up so that he/she can be there to help explain your reason for self-injury and to help your parents understand more clearly so they don't get as upset.<br>  <br>  I personally got reported by a teacher that saw a cut on my arm when I was washing my hands in science class (i was wearing long sleeves but had to roll them up to not get them wet). She called down to the councilor and said I was cutting. Latter that day I got called down to the councilors office and one of my parents were there. We went inside and he had me role up my sleeves to show him and my mom the cut. I was lucky enough that I had shop class and blamed it on a piece of equipment that I was working on and told them it didn't look to bad so I didn't report it to the teacher (I was in my 2nd year of high school). I was lying to them all, I was a self-injurer.

796222031a5d3c4eed560bdbe8ac734aaa	If you are a member of a gym, see if they offer a class called Body Pump. Its a one hour class that includes cardio and weight training at the same time. <br>  <br>  I'm sure you have plenty of muscle, you just need to shed some fat to see the definition. <br>  <br>  A good combination of cardio AND weight training is important. Don't neglect either. Cardio gets your blood flowing and burns calories, which burns fat. Weight training builds muscle with burns more calories than fat cells do. The more muscle you have, they more calories you will burn. <br>  <br>  Drink lots of water, watch what you eat, continue weight training, and do some cardio 4-5 times a week for at least 30 minutes. You'll lose it!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|mYTVka5Taa	Doing cardio before and after weight lifting is best.<br>  <br>  You can have awesome muscles but if you dont do cardio it will be harder to see them.<br>  <br>  I'd say at least 15 minutes before and 15 after, that way you get the 30 minutes (at least) you need a day and splitting it up is way easier than doing it all at once.

BCgt7oaKaa	Tramadol: It's a moderate pain medication,  which starts to work withing the hour. Try not to take it if you're on other medications, or also with alcohol. Not recommended for use if pregnant. Some side effects of this drug include seizures (life-threatening), dizziness, headache, somnolence, constipation and nausea. These are the most common side effects. To prevent constipation drink lots of fluids. <br>  <br>  Hydrocodone is also a moderate pain medication, works faster, but doesn't last as long. Medication should be avoided with any allergies with ibuprofen aspirin or acetaminophen. Side effects are confusion, dizziness, sedation, hypotension, constipation, nausea. <br>  <br>  Overall, they're both the same thing, although there are many more risks with hydrocodone as it is a much more dependent drug. The chances of addiction are high. Use caution and take only the recommended dose, as you should with any medication. <br>  <br>  HTH!|`|bUqh8fo4aa	I took it for a while for my back pain I eventually had to go to Hydrocodone(vicoden) so I am thinking that while it is several steps above an otc it is not as strong as vicoden<br>  Hope this helped--|`|cMssi4qraa	for pain it is quite effectiv epecially if u combine it with an over the counter med like aleve or tylenol.personally I think it lies somewhere between codeine and hydro.<br>  <br>  not sure if u also want to know this and I apologize if no but as far as producing opiate like euphoria it sucks. people that say it does are full of crap. all it will do in high doses is maybe stimulate a little and give u massive seizures.

AA11953398	It's quite simple. Curvy is when a girl holds her weight well (i.e., people find her attractive) She has hips, which make her carry herself well. Fat is when a girl is shapeless and does not hold her weight well.|`|n7KCez59aa	HI !<br>  <br>  Well, I'm a girl, but I guess I can answer this anyways.<br>  <br>  A woman who is curvy has an hour glass figure. This means a medium to large chest, which makes her waist look small, and hips that are wider than your waist.<br>  <br>  A thin girl has no chest, no butt and no hips. This type of figure is like a stick or straight line from head to toe. <br>  <br>  A fat girl has the figure of a circle. No defining curves of the chest, waist or hips.|`|W0a6EHb1aa	The best way to burn fat is to eat less food and move more often, the difficulties arise when we actually try to put that into operation!

Change your diet. Try and obtain most of your calories from complex carbohydrates (this will give you energy and keep you feeling full). Remember, you lose fat by burning more calories each day than you consume. Example: If you burn 2000 calories each day just by existing, and burn 300 more through exercise, eat less that 2300 calories. Never skip breakfast. Snacks are fine as long as they are healthy. Examples: fresh fruit and veggies, rice crisps, peanuts, yogurt, etc...) Also, little things will help tons! Like, switch to skim milk, eat low fat yogurt, use cooking spray instead of oils, opt for the low fat foods, eat whole grain bread... All these things will help a lot. <br>  <br>  2. Drink AT LEAST 8 (8oz) glasses of water each day. The more water you drink the better. Especially if you are working out.<br>  <br>  3. Try and do 20-40 minutes of continuous cardio exercise (jogging, speed walking, elliptical, biking) every day, at least 3 times per week (the more days you can do this, the better).<br>  <br>  4. Create a weight training schedule. Try to do some general strength training exercises at least 3 times per week. Remember, muscle burns fat. So, the more lean muscle tissue that is on your body, the faster you will burn fat.<br>  <br>  5. Stretch! This will help to lengthen and tone your muscles. Some studies even show that it can help to prevent injury. It also feels awesome!<br>  <br>  It sometimes takes about 8-12 weeks after starting a weight loss regime to see results (depending on the intensity of your fitness plan). So be patient, and keep with it! It will pay off.<br>  <br>  good luck! and if you have any other specific questions, send me an email, i like to help :)
dpgXzMenaa	I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Everyone can (and everyone deserves to) enjoy the pleasure of orgasm, including everyone who chooses to enjoy it alone instead of (or in addition to) having sex with someone else.<br>  <br>  Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second.<br>  <br>  I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure. It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation. You will *definitely* know when you have one. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm. Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbating is normal and healthy, and learning what pleases you sexually is good for you... especially because you'll know what to tell (better yet, to show) your man about how to please you when you eventually decide you're ready to have sex.|`|DtwqUqPTaa	hi..<br>  <br>  it's ok just enjoy with your body have fun,have relax and going on.|`|uJPcq36Daa	theres no harm in it at your age. its perfectly natural for everyone.|`|Opu49z33aa	Yep normal.

zfD0NX5oaa	tell her exactly how you feel. it seems to me that you really want to, but your concerned about how she feels. And tell her exactly what you said about how you dont mind if you have to wait and that you dont want her to tell you what she thinks you want to hear. By the way, if yourr not sure if your IN love with her and she's IN love with you too, then be prepared to lose her just in case. b/c most of the time  (with my friends) if they have sex with someone they're not in love with, it usually just ends up in heartbreak. So my overall answer is have sex if your truly ready. And by "ready" not only do i mean use protection, but make sure your sincerely in love. Plus, (from what i've heard) it's so much better & less awkward when your both ready. If your really ready make sure she is too. And if you still have second thoughts about how she feels about it, then maybe you need to take a step back and analyze whether your the one who's not ready. Whatever happens, good luck=)|`|a93da064b9ad5aa87707eafa3fe3d894aa	It just depends. If you have a loved one to give your virginity up to, then go for it.

Im sure you dont wan this to happen, so you need to let her bring up the subject. dont worry, she will get curious soon, and if you were talking about it with her before and you stop she will become even more curious.|`|ElSx2Mu6aa	the way this is written it sounds like you want to have sex and are unsure of how she feels, get to know her better, she might like you better if you wait a little because she will have a better emotional connection to you, I would say wait especially if you are young|`|Plq0BGSgaa	wait!<br>  <br>  <br>  pleeeeeeeease wait.|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	69?

B2cvkTp7aa	Ok, this Chanel M answer guy is answering EVERY QUESTION with his free trial version of Acai Berry. Guessing he gets money if you start buying it. I can say there is no magic pill to make you skinny. If there was, it would cost $500 a month and have a patent and FDA approval. Acai is an excellent antioxidant, just not a diet aid.<br>  <br>  I would say first get a thyroid test. Mine slowed down when I was 27 and I gained 30 lbs in one year and could not lose it. Then I had a thyroid test, got on a daily (lifelong) prescription, and have lost about 25 lbs.<br>  <br>  I also use the "5 factor diet" book by Harley Pasternak. It is a diet where you eat 5 times a day, each meal has 5 ingredients or less, and takes they say 5 minutes to make, I say  10-15 for meals, and 5 for snacks. <br>  <br>  It has really worked well for me, and you are not hungry or weak. I have no relation to the writer of this book, but it has really worked for me. It is so much food I sometimes can't finish my meals. My mother also got on it, and she is losing as well. Once you lose all the weight you want, you only do the diet a few days a week and eat normal the rest to maintain your weight. <br>  <br>  I don't know that this would work for you, but just thought I'd try to help.<br>  <br>  Maybe just go to the bookstore and copy a few recipes, and if you start losing, then buy the book. If you are otherwise healthy and active, I think your problem is either thyroid or just eating a bit more than you should.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best! Good luck! It sucks to diet, but the results are worth it.

Just relax. Take a weekend for yourself and do nothing except what you want to. You just need to slow down for a day or two and collect yourself before you jump back into your life.

If you just calm down for a bit, you'll be able to pick yourself back up again.

Plus time. No shortcuts
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|GsKIZZPwaa	simply: eat less. - no soda, no sugar, no cookies, no fast/junkfood, no salty things, no rice, no bad carbs,<br>  <br>  Excersize 30 mins a day..

uzfdgFSxaa	Go see a Gastroenterologist.  They can diagnois and treat your symptoms.  It sounds like IBS and can be controlled with proper treatment.|`|648ea51d75b359e14d9b6d08b816f6c0aa	Go SEE A DOCTOR NOW!!!!!<br>  <br>  Why people keep asking on the internet instead of going to hospital.|`|DAwEx4Egaa	Could be something worse, but that's not bad news. Your symptoms sound a lot like Celiac Disease or Gluten Intolerance, in which case a change of diet is all you need. Celiac can be diagnosed with a simple blood test in many cases - make sure the doctor checks your Gliadin (sp?) levels. In any case, you need to see a doctor, even if you can only go to a local clinic. Make sure you tell them of every symptom you have, even if they don't seem related. And try keeping a food journal for a while - you may notice that certain foods are triggering your problems.
nmozvlGPaa	There is live sperm in pre-ejaculatory fluids.  If the boy friend touched himself and got his finger(s) wet with this and then immediately fingered the girlfriend, then it is theoretically possible for her to get pregnant that way.  Sperm was introduced into the vagina.<br>  <br>  It is an old wive's tale that sperm die on contact with air.  <br>  <br>  If your 'friend' was at the right part of her cycle (about 2 weeks from the start of her previous period) she certainly could get pregnant this way.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	i very much think non't ...|`|5EfJu34taa	wat does pre c*m mean?<br>  anyways the answer to your question is that only if they both had sex(guy inserted his p*nis into gal's vagi*na) then she can get pregnant.so jus find out if they did so.
wT9KXIC0aa	No, there is nothing wrong with masturbating, it is natural and healthy.|`|GEqyvwXAaa	masturbating is not only not wrong, it's a good idea. by masturbating you can relax and achieve sexual release without risking STIs or pregnancy. it doesn't give you hairy palms, it doesn't make you go blind. nowhere in any religious text that i know does it explicitly forbid masturbation; and even in Genesis it implicitly forbids it only for men (it's a "waste of seed", but masturbation doesn't make women ovulate).|`|dpgXzMenaa	It's perfectly OK and right.<br>  <br>  God isn't going to punish you for masturbating. It's never happened to me, and here's a conservative estimate of the number of times I've masturbated to orgasm in my life.<br>  <br>  1973 to 1981, 7 per day = 20440<br>  1981 to 1997, 2.5 per day = 14600<br>  1997 to 2008, 10 per week = 5720<br>  Total to date = 40760 orgasms in 36 yrs<br>  <br>  If you and your religion are "against masturbation", then you and your religion are against being human. Period.<br>  <br>  Learn what being *human* actually is and judge yourself against humanity itself, not against misinterpreted legends.<br>  <br>  The only reference to masturbation in the Bible is the story of Onan, and the only reason he was condemned for masturbating is, it was his responsibility in that time and place to father some children by his dead brother's childless widow, but he "spilled his seed on the ground" instead of having sex with his brother's woman.<br>  <br>  Onan's "sin" wasn't masturbation... it was his refusal of a social obligation (God's *command*, supposedly) to continue his family's genes.<br>  <br>  Why is it such a taboo? That part's easy: a lot of people are scared to death by the idea of anyone (especially very young children) having the slightest sexual awareness at all outside of marriage... and they've been teaching that fear to their children for generations beyond counting. Their fears are nothing more than superstitions, but hey, organized religion is all *about* passing a society's superstitions through the generations.<br>  <br>  I don't suppose you've ever been permitted to learn the truth about all the people that masturbate... but it might interest you to know that infants masturbate (often to orgasm if they do it at all and - rarely - even during the last week or two before they're born)... that by the age of 12, almost 1/3 of all girls have been masturbating to orgasm at least occasionally for half their lives or more... that at age 15 it's 2/3 of them who are doing it regularly (many of those are doing it more than once a day)... or that by the age of 20, more than 80% of women are doing the same - regardless of whether they've ever had intercourse. Even very old people do it.<br>  <br>  Chances are only about one in 30 that your *parents* don't masturbate.<br>  <br>  Tips? Well, I can't tell you every step there is to have an orgasm... every girl and woman is different, and it would take way longer for me to type it all out than it would for you to give yourself one... but one thing you can do to find out is check out these webpages:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-basics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbation/masturbation-techniques.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.clitical.com/female-masturbat...</a><br>  <br>  Read the pages all the way through, and try some of the things suggested. Take your time (it might take a whole afternoon the first time), and just enjoy learning what feels best for you. Sooner or later, you'll have an orgasm in one or more of these ways, and they get better each time if you're one of those lucky girls who can have them again and again.<br>  <br>  Then you'll know what one is and how to have one, for sure.<br>  <br>  An orgasm is all the things you feel and all the things that happen with your body at the peak of sexual arousal and pleasure. It's a reflex we're all born with (just like knee jerks and sneezes) that our bodies have in response to sexual stimulation. You will *definitely* know when you have one. There's nothing else anywhere in human experience that feels that way.<br>  <br>  It can take a girl or woman anywhere from a few seconds to a couple of hours to reach orgasm. Both of these are pretty unusual but perfectly normal, and anything in between is just fine... and most can get there in much less than 10 minutes when they masturbate.<br>  <br>  Just before orgasm, you might have a feeling a bit like you have to pee, but it's not quite the same, and when your orgasm first happens, there'll be a very strong (sometimes intense and *powerful*), warm and sometimes tingly feeling that spreads from your clitoris to your vagina and then through your whole lower body. Then very quickly your clitoris, your vagina, your crotch muscles and your butt-hole will squeeze and pulse a few times while that feeling spreads all over you. <br>  <br>  During all this, your heart will beat *very* quickly, your toes will probably curl, you might feel like you need to hold your breath or like you have to breathe really fast, your body will want to tense up and might jerk or shake or shiver, and you might make some noises (grunts, gasps, groans or cries) that you can't really control. You might "squirt" or "ejaculate" a lot of fluid from your urethra (don't worry, it's not pee). The physical and emotional pleasure that you'll feel everywhere at the same time is just about the best feeling a human body can have.<br>  <br>  (Everything you "might" feel or do above isn't always going to happen... some orgasms are much less overwhelming than just *very* pleasureable.)<br>  <br>  As that feeling becomes more gentle and starts to go away (after maybe 5 to 20 seconds), your whole body will begin to relax, your skin will flush pinker (especially over your chest) and you might feel sort of like having a nap... or like just lying there and letting your mind drift... or even like doing it again (and again... etc) right away.<br>  <br>  It's not often, but it *can* happen sometimes that there'll be no interruption at all between several orgasms in a row, and it can feel like one single orgasm... intense physical pleasure and whole-body tension and release that can last anywhere from 30 or 40 seconds to several minutes.<br>  <br>  Have fun with it and don't worry. Masturbation is having sex with the only person you'll ever meet who knows *exactly* what you feel and what you like, even if that changes every second. It's normal and healthy, learning what pleases you sexually is good for you, and when it comes to having sex with the one you *want*, you'll be able to tell them (or to show them if you like) the things you like best.|`|NvGqiA4vaa	No it's not wrong! It's normal and relieves stress and tension and it's good for you. And of course it feels good. :)|`|WBKpSl5jaa	the guy with the long answer wants to be chosen as best answer lolz|`|7xc8jgLXaa	of course not!!|`|bf8lx9gxaa	Masturbating is perfectly normal.

r4uzzi3qaa	You probably just have really high metabolism, so you can eat pretty much whatever you want and you can burn it off easily. So I suggest just eating healthy. Your doctor will tell you if you need to gain weight and if so, how. <br>  <br>  ?|`|AA12035186	Maybe you have a tapeworm.

vLcOoy5paa	You need to add weight training to your exercise routine.  By building lean muscle mass, you'll up your basic metablic rate allowing for you to burn more calories in a day.  <br>  <br>  Here's an analogy that may help:<br>  <br>  Think of all of the cardio like adding a dab of gasoline to the fire.  It quickly increases the fire, but doesn't sustain for long.  By adding weight training to the mix, it's like adding another log to the fire, it sustains caloric burning longer & grows the fire.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your weight loss & dedication, but take a week and add up those "cheats".  I think that you'd be amazed to find out how quickly they add up to 1/2 lb here and a 1lb there.  I know it sucks to stick to the diet, but low cal alternatives handy to prevent you from cheating.|`|A5nZFjEoaa	It's your diet. Try cutting dessert maybe. Or eat fruit. about pasta and a footlong sub, it's wheat, but that's still carbs.

He's in 4th grade and I also have a problem with the school he goes to.  It seems they pick on him there, and the teachers don't do anything when he's being bullied, even though there's a rule about bullying.  So I have an idea what you're going through.  Your parents (or somebody else that will get results)  need to contact the Superintendent for the school district.  They are sort of like the principals boss.  If you/your parents have records of phone calls, emails & letters that have been sent to the school, that's even better.  It also helps to get an Advocate to help represent you & your parents in dealing with the school, changing schools, etc.  It's free for an advocate.  Please don't give anyone the satisfaction of killing yourself.  You want to see them again at your reunion & be beautiful & successful & knock their socks off!!  If you need any help, I'll be happy to do what I can.  One more bit of advice I can give since I was bullied when I was in grade school & middle school everyday?  They thrive on picking on the "weaker" kids.  They love it when you cry.  If you act like it doesn't bother you, they'll move on to someone else.  It's ok to cry, but try not to do it when they can see you.  It'll just keep them coming after you.  Take care!<br>  <br>  Jen|`|Pd0L0Jqdaa	Oh God! I feel so bad for you. I went to a school JUST LIKE THAT! I got severly abused by my teachers and peers. My teachers would hit me - alot. Students would kick me. Yell at me. But you must tell your parents. Or if you really must - get kicked out. Disobey all the rules. Get yourself out of that situation. Do whatever you must. You have my permission. If your parents won't help to have to get yourself out. I know how dreadful it is to be in a school like you are in now. I got beat up tons of times at that horrible school of mine. Like I said, Get yourslef out of there! I'm so sorry this has happened to you too.|`|rkC443vnaa	omigod! i am horrified by what is happening to you! gosh, what i would do is majorly talk to my parents and refuse to go to school, until they transfer me or like you said cyber schooling. you definetly need friends. i am going to email you, and add you as my friend.

BLD9EEWNaa	First of all, adderall won't get you A's, even though it might help.  <br>  <br>  Second, PROBABLY nothing bad will happen to you if you take it (half the medicated kids in America are on adderall- I was prescribed it for a year), but the beauty of being prescribed medication by a doctor is that they know things like whether or not you have a specific allergy, heart condition or blood pressure problem that could make adderall really dangerous for you.  There's a very good chance that nothing bad will happen to you at all.  But there is that slim chance...<br>  <br>  Third- you may not like the way it effects you.  I liked it at first, but then it just made me feel like I had too much caffeine in my body, and my body was always tense, but my mind wouldn't concentrate.  Sometimes I felt like my chest was just going to collapse and the emptiness inside me was going to eat me from within.  So I stopped taking it.  <br>  <br>  Fourth- If you take it, take into account that the more days you take it in a row, the more tired you will be when you stop taking it.  If you do decide to take it, 20mg should be enough, and I would take it every other day- sometimes the affects of it carry over to the next day.  <br>  <br>  Just be careful until you know how you'll react to it.|`|cSqx1DxKaa	I don't get why kids think Adderall is a magic cure-all for bad grades.  Taking stimulants isn't going to help you get good grades; it's going to make it hard for you to sit still long enough to study.  <br>  <br>  You need a tutor or a few days of staying after school for extra help.

Im a junior in college and I convinced my doctor to gie me aderall to help me study for school. It works but the effects wear off and the side effects suck.

Aderall is a very addictive medicine and at 15 if you take it and you dont need it your going to put yourself into a bad situation.|`|GDW03Axcaa	Adderall can be habit forming and must be used with caution.You should not take it casually.

It is dangerous to take it without a prescription.|`|Z8qBgv8taa	If you have ADD/ADHD I dont think it's a problem.

6bd5dc5ab362e218189d7e6247b7a2f6aa	Hi, I am a former disability claims examiner for the social security administration's DDS, or disability determination services agency. <br>  <br>  The federal disability system (and this includes social security disability and SSI as well) is set up so that a person can work and apply for disability benefits. If they've been previously approved for disability benefits (for a mental or physical impairment), they can also work and receive disability benefits.<br>  <br>  The social security administration does not bar a disability applicant or recipient from working. What is taken into consideration is how much money a person is making while they are either filing for disability or receiving disability.<br>  <br>  The cutoff amount is known as SGA, which stands for substantial gainful activity. Every year, the SGA amount changes. For the year 2009, the SGA amount was set at $980.00 meaning that, in 2009, a person could apply for disability, or receive disability, as long as their "gross monthly work earnings" did not equal this amount.<br>  <br>  Translation: if your gross monthly earned income is less than $980 (in 2009 that is; remember that the SGA amount goes up each year) then you can receive disability benefits. If your gross monthly earnings equal or exceed this amount, you become ineligible to receive disability benefits.|`|1oBilGHuaa	The person can try to get an easy part time job that he/she knows he/she can do.

The longer you go without brushing, the more stains your teeth will have and it will get harder and harder to get rid of. And yea you can use whitening strips but they make your teeth really weak if you use them too much.|`|2fYyw4LBaa	If you know your a bad 'brusher' just make the time to do a better job at brushing your teeth AT LEAST twice a day... and yes if you do not brush properly with braces on you will get stains.... that look like little white squares or dots where the braces use to be. Use a mouthwash in between brushing to get rid of food and bacteria. good luck|`|FH2iKFcJaa	Thats just disgusting, yes you can end up with stains.|`|3KyVMVncaa	Yes, trust me. I too was lazy when I had my braces. And I have staining. My teeth have white spots toward the gums called de-calcification. Its the stage before a cavity. I've done the white strips and they only seem to make the spots brighter and more noticeable. So, unless you want to shell out hundreds of dollars for a Professional whitening treatment when you get your braces off, you will be stuck with stains. <br>  You should get yourself into a new routine. Brush when you go take your morning pee, and when you head to bed, or take a shower. They say it takes 20 times before something becomes a habbit. So stick with it and pretty soon you wont be able to leave your house or go to bed without taking care of your smile! Good luck!
Lau1sLTDaa	i wouldn't say BAD for them, but it will certainly slow down the movement of your teeth, resulting in having your braces on for a longer time. but we all have those times - something comes up, so you need to reschedule. don't worry about it.|`|2fYyw4LBaa	2 weeks wont make too much of a difference if anything it'll just take 2 weeks longer to get your teeth straight.... its not necessarily bad for your teeth... it just prolongs the process.

iMfk6bO7aa	I recently tried Bromalite and liked it a lot.  I have to admit it really did “clean me out”.  I would recommend reading reviews before you buy to make sure that it is the right choice for you.  I read a great review on <a href="http://bromalite-colon-cleanse-review.blogspot.com." rel="nofollow">http://bromalite-colon-cleanse-review.bl...</a>   <br>  <br>  One other recommendation I have is that if you do take Bromalite, as with any colon cleansing product, make sure to drink lots of water.  By drinking water this will help alleviate any constipation.(wish I knew about this before)  Hope that helps!
mlaLgoaSaa	well, you burn about 340 calories/hour at a pace of 4.0 mph... so, in order to burn 500 calories, you would need to walk about 1.5 hours. <br>  <br>  And... as for which equipment burns the most calories, fastest... it all depends on your heart rate (bpm) and how long it is sustained. so, if you jog 30 minutes on a treadmill, maintaining a heart rate of 150 bpm, and you worked-out on an elliptical trainer for 30 minutes, maintaining a heart rate of 150 bpm, both exercise sessions would probably be burning about the same amount of calories.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.

Cause I DO Get Made Fun Of.<br>  I Exercise Too But Really NO Results Eating Junk Food Just Makes It Worse. It Makes You Less Healther.|`|k1HcSg5Zaa	ok i have the same problem i have been trying muscle milk.. i am aswell very active so muscle milk has 230 callories and 80 calories from fat, it also has 25g of protein.. the way how it works is that if you drink it and not be active after drinking it, u gain weight, and if u drink it and work out after, then that gain weight turns the fat to muscle. the way how i use it is i drink 1 bottle in the morning, then go to school, after school i play soccer.  so before soccer i drink another. after dinner i sometimes take 1 more depending if i am that full or not.  it is up to u how much u want to take.  my average weight gain a month is around 7 pounds, and one time i had 14 pound weight gain in 1 month.  muscle milk is expensive if u buy botttle seperatly.  i commend you to go to big stores like costcos or something like that, so u can buy a package of them... or whereever u can buy a package of them.. they also ussaully sell seperate bottles at deli's but it is more expensive.  unless ur lactose intollerent, try to get the regular one, because it has more fat than the lactose 1.  my fav flavor is chocolate.  it might taste nasty at first but it grows on u and u end up liking it.  try to use it if you want it really works and helps.  i only have been using it for 4 months but so far it is good. i am 14 and  4 months ago i was 5 feet and weighed 72 pounds.  i am now 5 1 and curently weigh 105 pounds.  i am trying to now keep it at this weight as now i am just using muscle milk before i work out for some muscles!   hope this helps! =) TRY IT.. if you decide to use it than e-mail me and tell me how it is going at mrcrodude@aim.com!

ItJzrvQ4aa	an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.
QnJvJ67uaa	Why my blood pressure dropped when I had a C section I started shaking. If the nurses weren't worried that's probably all it was.<br>  Good luck with baby :)|`|CT3t80suaa	Different people respond to blood flow irregularities differently. Some people shake, others simply crash to the floor. It would depend upon blood pressure and a bit about general fitness levels.|`|7b5d7721387ea9716cf48828f5d4cc1caa	I got very faint after giving blood (though didn't faint) and it can be to do with the sugar levels in the blood before giving blood.

When I was in the 2nd grade a kid behind me had one.. He fell out of his chair shook and tried swallowing his tongue.

ZuYTZ80Gaa	There is no issue at repeating and repeating TB tests, you stand no chance of getting sick.<br>  <br>  All that it is is a protein (PPD) that is a part of the TB bacteria, injected under the skin.  If the body has a reaction to it, you get some local swelling, and it means you've been exposed to TB (and you need further testing).<br>  <br>  I personally do mine once a year, and after I encounter a patient that has had TB...so it turns out to be 3-4 times a year.|`|AA12398758	A good person to ask would be your nursing instructor.  It seems, if you can prove you already had it and it is recent enough for them, you wouldn't need another.|`|f8mLpPXlaa	No. There's no problem. If you told one about the other they might cancel theirs. But if they insist don't worry about it.

wMx9Z2gTaa	Hepatitis C is a virus that causes chronic inflammation of the liver. Under normal circumstances, it remains "silent" for a long time and may not produce symptoms for years. Even if there are no symptoms, the virus is present in the blood stream and in other body fluids. It is contracted by direct contact with those fluids. Blood transfusions, IV needle contamination, and needle sharing by drug users are all means of transmitting the disease.<br>  <br>  I believe your friend can become a nurse, but she will have to be extra careful to use "universal precautions" when treating patients. Your friend will also be followed by her doctors to monitor the health of her liver.<br>  <br>  You can go to the US Center for Disease Control for more information.|`|AA12097239	She can have the virus but she doesn't have the disease and might never have it.

If he's got nerve damage to the main optic nerve's I'm afraid to say he'll never get his eyesight back and it'll never get better. <br>  My husband is almost blind and only has a regular eye test at the opticians, he's not under a hospital anymore because theres nothing more they can do for him. Same goes for our daughter she only has eye checks at the opticians, they can only do what a hospital could do for her. <br>  My father in law is totally blind and has no check ups at all, theres no point in his case, but like I said it does depend on why the blindness is there.|`|2GaCSyRKaa	The eye department at the hospital should advise him .<br>  If not, go to a good optometrist for a regular eye examination. He/she will give him advice.|`|E047GSKdaa	Eye exams can determine a person's general health.

a6a4afaeae9743a281b59fbb111afadaaa	It sounds to me like they're jealous of the happiness you've found in your relationship. True friends would be happy that you're happy. If you love the guy, and he loves you, then there's no reason for them to try and tear you apart unless they're jealous. <br>  <br>  If I were you I'd tell them that you're going to be together, and they can either be supportive and accepting of that fact or they can say goodbye to your friendship.|`|il9vgn2qaa	If your friends keep saying how different you and him are, i would personally just ignore them as they always say that it's the opposites that attract. Also it's your relationship and not your friends, i would try and not let them interfer so much. It also seems that maybe you and your own friends are drifting apart abit, maybe because of the things they're saying. <br>  Just see how things go and maybe ask them why they are coming up with such crazy ideas?

5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	Imaging in musculoskeletal medicine really doesn't help plan the course of treatment (aside from major stuctural damage).  That being said, it's perfectly acceptable to go to PT without a specific diangosis.  We rarely need to know that exact pain generator, your mechanical presentation is more important.  It's part of the physical thearpy evaluation to determine if it's a "shoulder" problem or a "neck" problem (ie, a pinched nerve).  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't recommend the expense of an MRI (could be up to a $1000 co-pay) unless you have widespread neurological deficits, profound weakness, or if you have the symptoms in both upper extremities . <br>  <br>  MRIs almost never help me direct treatment.  <br>  <br>  I'd specifically recommend a PT who is certified in mechanical diagnosis and therapy.  Go to www.mckenziemdt.org to find one.|`|EqfWi7Ohaa	Sometimes doctors refer people to PT for initial eval and then if that eval shows increased pain. weakness etc. Pt will then recommend to the MD that nerve studies or MRI etc. need to be done . It also gives the MD leverage with the insurance company so they can't deny services so easily.|`|n7qcfWxkaa	Try a good chiropractor.  They can do amazing things.  My chiropractor has treated me successfully for pinched nerves, whiplash, back and neck pain, fatigue, TMJ, restless leg syndrome, and mild carpal tunnel syndrome, among other things.  I don't know what I'd do without him.<br>  <br>  Yes, they treat shoulders, arms, and wrists.  Get references from people who use them.|`|eZDoQPg8aa	It never hurts to get a second opinion.  Try an orthopedic specialist this time.  He may decide to send you to a neurologist but I'd start there.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	If you don't think movement and exercise will help your problem, then don't go.  Yes, if your dr. cannot figure out what it is, you need a specialist.  For a nerve problem that would be a neurologist.<br>  <br>  TX Mom

Primary care is the family health service provided by doctors (GPs), dentists, opticians and pharmacists although the distinction is becoming more blurred.<br>  <br>  Local hospitals <br>  Care homes (nursing/residential homes)  <br>  Drug treatment services <br>  Walk-in centres
GfG6wupTaa	It probably is a reaction to the anesthesia. Have you ever been put to sleep before? Or, what kind of pain killers did they have you on? Morphine makes you throw up also.pretty much any kind of opiate will make someone throw up.

170GrvE0aa	You can get them but I suggest you shouldn't. First of all,  the price is pretty extreme,a pair of prescription glasses and sunglasses can cost less than a pair of transition lenses! Of course, you need a reputable shop. I bought all my glasses from www.optical4less.com. Also, I don't find transition lenses that useful because you can't really control them. I don't find much advantages using them. I really recommend just buying the prescription sunglasses/normal glasses. Good luck.|`|1IyzZTpjaa	I paid an extra 75.00 for mine. But even if you have to pay 3 times that much, you will love them. It is worth every penny. <br>  <br>  The astigmatism makes no difference.|`|p27jMTFuaa	Yes you can get transitions with almost any prescription.  Astigmatism is no problem.  The cost ranges depending on the office. $500 seems expensive for just the transition upgrade.  I have heard anywhere from $60-$120 (United States) for the typical transitions upgrade in addition to the base lens price.
vDr5aROwaa	There are a lot of things that you could take to regulate you to where you don't have to get diarrhea. Why don't you try the activa that comes out on tv. My girfriend tried it and she says it works real good. Also frosted mini wheats before you go to bed at night will also make you go. And make sure that you drink plenty of water. Water will always help you get rid of the waste. Try these things before you start making yourself get diarrhea. When you get diarrhea, you also get rid of the good bacteria that we have in our intiestines that we need. Good Luck|`|fQch3BkEaa	i suggest you take some of those laxitives thingy's they helped me when i was in hospital and was clogged up after the operation
Po2UqfvWaa	it doesn't get better only worse and that's sad i know. safety around your son has to be done. however, it still is their home. there may be a time you just have to say sorry we can't come. this is an issue for your husband and his family to decide what to do. you can look up agencies that may be able to help you. but like i said, it's your husbands family and they need to do this and your husband step up to the plate. i only say this because you are not legally able to make decisions for the family. your husband could force medical treatment if they see that his father is a harm to himself and others. this conversation should be taking place with him not the in-laws|`|DUq74Xr7aa	You just need to stick to the mentality that he probably wont be with you much longer.<br>  <br>  If he does have dementia then he wont be remembering much of what you say, so you just need to be really passive in the conversations.<br>  <br>  Don't get angry, don't get worried, just understand that this happens.<br>  If things are really that bad you should probably think about consulting doctors, getting the right medications, things that will make life easier.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't want to recommend putting him in a nursing home but it's always an option, some people do that. - Perhaps you've taken care of him long enough.<br>  <br>  Overall though, it's just a day by day thing, don't think about how much worse he's gonna get or how much longer he has to live but just know that it wont go on forever and that you and your family members have to deal with it just as much as he does. It's a painful process, I have a family member with dementia too and I've got to say I'm glad we're not having to take care of her.|`|paerqxfMaa	Is your FIL a military veteran?  If yes, contact your local VA and make an appointment for  him to be evaluated.  That's the easiest.  Otherwise, you need to stress to your MIL the issue of HER safety as well - my father went the same way and my mother was exhausted.  I finally informed her that he needed to go the hospital to be evaluated and we would take it from there - I told her that although he may not mean to beat her to death, it happens all the time - they are confused and agitated and have an unknown source of strength.  They, of course, evaluated him, and he was placed into a nursing home for the last 14 months of his life.  It wasn't pleasant, but he didn't really know, he was safe and well cared for, my mom could visit him as often as she wanted and did have to deal with the day to day care that he required.  It was the best thing for everyone concerned.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	Honestly I think in most cases it is best to put them into a assisted living home of some sort... they become too dangerous to themselves and others.  You should not include him on any conversations regarding this subject. You need to have a talk with her and maybe do some research before hand explaining to her how dangerous it can be because she can't be helping him every second of ever day ..they are worse than  a baby because they can reach things, they know how to turn stoves on etc...<br>  His physical and mental needs are too much for one person ...he really should be somewhere where they can keep him and everyone around him safe<br>  <br>  God bless & Good luck to you and your family|`|rvoo4rBjaa	As long as they are in denial there really isn't much you can do.but there are support groups that can help in many ways so when they are ready to accept it have the information at hand for them. Hopefully there won't be any accidents then the proper authorities would step in and they would not have much choice.
OEcXRYVFaa	its probably just a pimple from irritation or sweating when you sleep or just your breast rubbing together kind of thing. i get them sometimes in the summer from the heat just make sure your showering properly if you sweat and don't pick at  it if it isn't popping and you tyr to make it thats how you get a scar. and if you want to fade your other scar use bio oil or vitamin e oil works great

Make her drink lots of clear fluids, like water, in order to keep her hydrated.<br>  <br>  If she is throwing up blood or has been throwing up constantly for long periods of time, or you suspect food poisoning maybe you should take her to the hospital.<br>  <br>  Sometimes people get sick, it is not necessarily a big deal, don't worry.
mlaLgoaSaa	hmmm... 2 weeks isn't much time. i would recommend drinking lots and lots of water. eat a low fat, low calorie diet. keep your heart rate in fat burning zone for at least 35 minutes continuously, at least 5 days per week. and do a low resistance/high rep weights circuit every other day of the week. still, two weeks? i don't know how much improvement you will see in such a small time frame. good luck.

iAv9P3HTaa	A "quick" way to get abs is in the combination of diet and exercises.<br>  It depends on body fat with males it starts showing under 10%.<br>  These exercises much more effective then push ups or sit ups:<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Crunch<br>  Lie with the ball resting under the mid/lower back and place hands behind the head or across the chest. Contract your abs to lift your the torso off the ball, pulling the bottom of your ribcage down toward your hips. As you curl up, keep the ball stable.<br>  <br>  <br>  Crunch & Reach<br>  Begin with body straight over the ball, light weight extended behind you (not shown). Contract the abs to lift and bring the weight over the head, crunching up and twisting to the right, contracting the right side of waist. Repeat for all reps and then switch sides.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Modified Plank<br>  Begin by placing elbows on the floor and resting body on the knees. Pull the abs tight to hold your body in a straight line from head to knees without sagging in the middle, eyes looking naturally forward. Hold this position for as long as you can, relax and repeat 3 or more times.<br>  <br>  <br>  Knee Tucks<br>  Start in plank position on the ball, with the ball under the shins/ankles. Roll the ball towards you with your feet, tightening the abs into a crunch.<br>  <br>  <br>  Woodchops<br>  Attach one end of a resistance band to something sturdy and wrap the band around your hand a few times for the right tension. Grasp the band in both hands and begin in a lunge position, reaching down with the arms Keeping the arms straight the entire time, rotate and lift the body towards the other side while sweeping the arms on a diagonal. Return to start and repeat before moving onto the other side.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hip Extension on the Ball<br>  Lie on the floor with feet heels propped on ball. Keeping abs tight, slowly lift your hips off the floor (squeezing the buttocks) until body is in a straight line. Hold for a few seconds and lower<br>  <br>  <br>  Ball Taps<br>  Sit on the ball with strong abs and straight spine, hands behind the head. Contract your abs and lift the right foot, tapping it on a medicine ball in front of you. Lower and repeat with the other foot, alternating sides. Use your abs to keep your balance.<br>  <br>  How to Work Your Abs<br>  <br>  * You can effectively work your abs with 3 non-consecutive workouts a week<br>  * Do 1-3 sets of 12-16 reps of each exercise. If that's too easy, make sure you're doing each exercise correctly and using perfect form. You can add a dumbbell or plate to crunches to add difficulty.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|g2R7e2eVaa	sit ups and crunches|`|gCAoXG9Baa	i have a good girl 4 pack and i do this everyday--><br>  <br>  put your feet on a chair (raised about 1 foot off ground) and stretch your legs out strait, i know its no profesional workout, but boy does it work! it really tightens and sculpts your core, then also just do alot of crunches, you can do thousands of small ones that dont take alot of effort, they wear you out but they'll give you easy abbs and a flat sexy tummy:) (do this for about 1-2 hours every day)|`|O0SD7e3aaa	Do crunches, not sit ups sit ups work mostly the lower stomach but crunches aren't all the way up they're half way up and work the middle of the stomach & the abs. Also believe it or not if you walk or run that works. Another exercise you could do would be bring your knees to your chest, lay on your back and do that make sure to do it about maybe 15-20 times a night and i'd recommend 25 crunchs the first week then 35 the next and so on.. good luckkkk!|`|pquw7AdQaa	try reverse sit ups!<br>  But remember ab exercises only work your mid section but don't get rid of the fat

Im losing lots of weight, plus i eat very healthily. You can email me for support :)|`|AA10232909	I know it's tempting to want to lose weight fast. Here are a few reason not to.<br>  <br>  1. Your skin has expanded along with your body as you grow.<br>  If you suddenly lose weight you are going to have loose skin. Your skin needs time to adjust to the new size..  <br>  <br>  2. There are effects on your heart and other organs of extreme weightloss. ( not good)<br>  <br>  My suggestion is too look at it like this<br>  <br>  What are you eating? why? how much?<br>  <br>  It's great that your exercising.. :) Keep up the good work.. However, I learned that diet is 70% of the weightloss;( <br>  <br>  1. Salt- watch the salt intake on everything.. read labels.. be under 2000mg a day at the most<br>  <br>  2. Sugar- Cookies , cakes , icecream all contain sugar - unless sugar free  which will turn to fat if the energy is not used.<br>  <br>  3. Feed the body.. starving yourself doesn't help either your body is like the engine of a car.. it needs fuel to run ... ppl recommend eating serveral times a day ( I never did this because of time/ money)<br>  <br>  ok another way to look at it is a mathmatical solution<br>  Calories in vs calories out<br>  Your body burns so many calories a day if you taken in less than that amount you will lose weight. www.dailyplate.com<br>  <br>  This is a great website! It will tell you how many calories you need to eat to lose the weight you want in a certain time frame..

wGTisY1aaa	You cannot just do sit-ups to help get rid of love handles or make your stomach flat, and you cannot get thinner thighs by just doing workouts for your thighs. If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts. All of this combined with a proper diet full of lean protein and carbs, and you should be in business. If you need anymore help email me.

I take Sundays off to rest and relax. Push pull for example is doing triceps extension with or without a break then doing biceps curls and adding reverse or regular crunches in there to make sure I get abs in and it cuts down on time. I do abs a lot to keep my core strong. I try to get all of the muscles in that area to work together on the same day. Do the amount of weight for what you want to accomplish. Say for toning, lightweight and high reps (15-20) and 3-4 sets. To build muscle, 2-3 sets and 10-12 reps. All beginners need to start with 1-2 sets and 8-10 reps with lightweights. Remember to stretch after your workout to keep from cramping up.10-15 minutes of stretching is optimal. This workout can be done all at once or like you would do 2 a days.<br>  <br>  Monday- biceps triceps and shoulders/ cardio for 65 minutes <br>  Tuesday – cardio 1hr and 15 min/abs<br>  Wednesday - chest back and abs/ cardio for 65 minutes<br>  Thursday cardio 1 hour and 15 minutes<br>  Friday- legs/ cardio for 65 minutes <br>  Saturday- cardio hour and 15 minutes/ abs<br>  Sunday- off<br>  <br>  This routine has helped me lose 70 lbs of fat and 16 inches off my entire body and gain 45 lbs of muscle after having a baby.

Her doctor told her to just manage her time more wisely, not procrastinate, do her work right when she got home, relax a bit in her newly-gained free-time and then go to bed earlier than she normally did.  This was about 4-5 years ago, and now she's totally fine.

gbUKzTyVaa	its not about eating, really... well, you want to eat healthy, balanced, 5 bigger meals a day, and eat alot of meats and proteins and even protein shakes....<br>  <br>  butttt the MAIN THING you wanna do is play sports, and lift weights! once you're basically done growing, you can lift weights.  by building up strength, you will inevitably build up muscle- thus the GOOD KIND of weight! guys dont want the girl to EAT her way to more weight... but a curvy toned girl with a little muscle is kinda sexy|`|jN83NgfTaa	eat more carbs and protein.<br>  Don't worry, your metabolism slows down as you get older so you might gain those 10 lbs soon.|`|CE8ZUKL9aa	That's a pretty avg. weight and you aren't underweight like I am, so you don't have to worry.|`|tMJhvpeEaa	eat some spaghetti and drink a lot of milk also eat and drink a little bit faster don't eat to slow but not that fast also|`|lVKwnFvjaa	At 14 you probably haven't finished growing. If you bulk up now, you might end up being a 500lb porker by the time you are somewhere between  18 and 25.  Beyond eating sensible, nutritious meals, let nature take its course.
mG2lZRrXaa	I think your friend should decide that.
5j3hQfa0aa	With your child's medical hx,they will have to be careful with medications. Yes, your child's doctor can give you a prescription to help keep your child calm. As far as the dentist pulling or capping will depend on the extent of damage to the tooth,nerve damage,ect. Above all, keep telling the child she/he did nothing wrong and you and the doctor and dentist are there to help her/him. Thank GOD, we live in a country we can receive medical care for ourselves and our families.
1accebcfa5f7af07e3721c9f3d2645cbaa	Both sides? How long? Would need more info. to help. Sorry. I would go to the doctor obviously if this is causing alot of discomfort. Tell your parents if you haven't already.|`|IkHTD61Gaa	idk, but that happens to me too. it's kind of a sharp-ish pain.

I'm on my period right now wearing a pad and it is ANNOYING!|`|089fc69ee0731b62401c891ee082f824aa	used them for 14 years and i dont mind them, honestly i forget that i wear them cos they dont bother me.<br>  tried tampons loads of times and i hate them dont think i couldnt ever get used to them and seein as pads are comfy think ill be sticking with them for another 25-30 years.<br>  hope this helps|`|BRDqfAy3aa	discover all possible menstrual hygienic products - see below|`|c988da9cd1b646c85c7d380dd8048467aa	Gosh I HATE using pads, but I also hate using tampons so I think pads are a better solution, even thought I hate them :S|`|7xc8jgLXaa	well, i don't LOVE them (but that may be because I hate my period LOL) but I certainly don't mind them. I've worn them most of the time for 8 years and I don't think they feel like a diaper or anything until they need to be changed.<br>  <br>  I use Stayfree Ultra Thin w/wings and they are thin, comfy, and discreet|`|xbedCzcraa	Yeah i don't mind wearing them. <br>  they don't bother me at all. <br>  and plus i don't think i like the idea of having a tampon inside of me. lol.<br>  <br>  used pads since i started my period. 5 years ago.|`|8NZC6LsRaa	I cannot stand the idea of using tampons, so pads are my only alternative. I certainly don't like them, but what else can I do??|`|mAQHyfCYaa	I don't like having to wear them but I'm at high risk for TSS so I can't use tampons :( so while they are annoying I am used to them. I wish I could use tampons though.|`|AS8VyrVgaa	go with pads. they're easier.|`|5iaLSL6qaa	eww<br>  no tampons|`|0wjn0d22aa	I could not use tampons for awhile so I had to wear pads. They get one my nerves. I like tampons because it is cleaner and you don't feel like there is a big nasty things between your legs. Try different sizes and also tampons and you will see what you like.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	I bleed very heavily, so i stick with pads. I hate them, but i just starting using these pads called "always infinity" and they're great. It's very light and feels like nothing at all. Best pads ever, i will wear nothing else.
XI9iOfOSaa	This is normal for most men. One (usually the left) hangs a little lower than the right|`|AA10350894	Pretty much every male has one testicle that is larger then the other. You will also notice that one hangs slightly lower then the other as well.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	No.  I asked my family doctor about 20 years ago.|`|K0iFV73Gaa	You should get a physical every year. No, this is not abnormal. One will hang lower for sure. If their are unusual lumps or pain than their is a problem. Just look. Cancer will be up behind the back of the testicle. Healthy would be smooth. Hard kind of like a boiled egg but not hard like a rock.|`|ZvW8dvt4aa	no, its not cancer, most men have larger testicles, and one hangs lower its ususually the left one don't worry!!!|`|XmD61yBpaa	No, like me, you are an odd-ball. Be proud of it, I am !|`|ehnxg6Utaa	so do most normal guys.|`|f7GPOxooaa	go to the doctor no one on the internet will be able to give you that answer <br>  but that can be very serious!<br>  my brother had that and was too embarrassed to tell anyone until 5 years later he was finally diagnosed and because he waited so long he had a very tough 3 years with treatments and surgeries|`|vJBq8ZFkaa	this is completely normal one testicle hangs higher than the other i will put a website in the bottom go to it and it might tell you|`|3AY5lS9saa	Quite normal buddy|`|kTkUQvl9aa	all guys have one testis bigger than the other<br>  you are normal
f4AJHCHKaa	Lots of women take them when they are not pregnant. I have never heard that they slow down your metabolism. I dont think that it will hurt anything.
8WYWEDOpaa	What country were you in and where are you now?<br>  <br>  You didn't mention how your spine is effected by the Harrington rod.<br>  <br>  Patients into their 60's (and even older) have fusions.  Its always risky to add or remove rods but I doubt that being 22 is more risky.<br>  <br>  The process for removing a rod is much like putting it in.  The doctor will have to go through your back to get to your spine, chip off the bone that has grown around the rod, and then take it out.  Recovery will also be much like it was previously.<br>  <br>  Harrington rods often cause "flatback".  This is a condition where your normal lordosis (or sway in your lower back) is removed.  Maybe not removed all the way, but at least reduced.  Over many years, this condition becomes quite painful and if pain meds don't help, re-alignment surgery is the only treatment.  (I don't have H-rods but do have flatback.)|`|xNEhI9XOaa	Well, you sound like a brave person doing your best to cope with what must be a bad situation.  I have every sympathy.  However, you are asking the wrong people.  The people on YA wouldn't know a Harrington rod if it was shoved down their throats.<br>  <br>  You need to ask your doctor and your specialist consultant these questions.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.
Ba5PVgHMaa	Eat about half of your meal an hour before you work out, like spagetti or something high in protien, itll give you alot more energy. Then eat the other half after the workout. Its just as important to eat right  after you work out, as it is to eat right before you work out. Your body needs that stuff to prepare, and recover.|`|ZyQbfhYRaa	Make sure you have a little protein in you before you workout, and then eat after your workout.  Your body can burn more afterwards, and you won't feel nauseous during the exercise.|`|78eefad2fa8273a595fc47a0853b001baa	eat before a work you will feel better and have more engery
QnJvJ67uaa	Personally I always feel fatter lol..I feel puffy and woozy.|`|lTNcvqyHaa	If you do you may have fluid retention. Check your ankles for puffiness. Then see your doctor|`|LP1vTJCFaa	Your stomach is probably not distended because you have not eaten throughout the night. Also, you are "technically" taller in the morning than the evening due to compression of your spine by standing/sitting during the day, but not by much.|`|677cd9504a4dd2cc20e08837396ca7adaa	I wish I could find a mirror Ilooked skinnier in!
9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, you can still be ovulating at 13-16 days.  The normal ovulation period is around 10-14 days, but it could go to 16 if someone is under stress (an example only).<br>  <br>  Yes, dietary changes can throw off a period but I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.

Swallowing hurts.|`|wMunBQ9Oaa	Cigarettes will kill your asss!  That should be enough reason right there.  They'll make you wheeze at night while you're trying to sleep (it'll sound as if you have some puppies whimpering in the bed with you), they'll give you emphysema or lung cancer or both, if not that they'll just make your chest burn like they use to do me.  I quit the som biches last October, but now I'm beginning to dream that I have started cheating by smoking again.
B6Te6MIVaa	Well heyyy (:<br>  so of course your meal plan is almost near perfect. Very well balanced and well spread out to keep you staying full! The only thing I would suggest is eating a bit more for lunch. That seems extremely small; I don't know if it would sustain you since you are doing so much exercise. For your snack since Im guessing it's after school you definitely need protein and healthy carbs. So either a healthy relatively low (200 cal) in calories protein bar would be awesome. Or buy "better n eggs" its all egg whites and 1/4 cup is only 30 calories and 6 grams protein! You could have a 3/4 cup of that with a whole wheat wrap and that would be amazinggg. And so much protein!<br>  Geez your dinner is small too haha. How many calories are you limiting yourself to? I think you definitely need no less than 1500 calories...make sure you are getting that. Otherwise you will be weak, sore, and low energy. Notttt good. but otherwise, good job at planning (:
8j7FCEOraa	A girlfriend and mine back in high school were smoking in a back alley at night. We turned the car off and started doing our thing. We look up, and thought we seen someone walking towards us! Of course being high and not wanting to get caught we were freaking out! 20 minutes later, we realized, it was a light post.<br>  <br>  :)|`|fQh5Qkkkaa	nothing really strange, unless my weed is laced.<br>  but once it was laced with some mescaline,<br>  and i saw the universe.|`|sVrkjixAaa	My friend had a green glow somehow (not sure why).

PAvYZJK2aa	it is not right at all|`|IM3QwSS2aa	hitting - no; neither my son.<br>  <br>  <br>  spanking for discipline reasons - yes.|`|39ixfEIraa	Naw not these days, well hitting a girl is out of the question. maybe if you had a daughter who is 4-7 years old and u gave her a spanken than that would be acceptable, but to "HIT" than no....i have mixed feelings supposed and adult woman you know 25 years old starts beating the crap out of you than i think you should be able to at least push her on the ground and sustain her, if she has weapons than malee that *****|`|EcCbforQaa	Up until about the age of 7, yes. But not if your really angry.|`|Tq98g20raa	obviously not...|`|awskuSGBaa	No, theyre are better ways to discipline.|`|lpadt3bCaa	There is a distinct line between "hitting a daughter in anger" and "disciplining a daughter with by spanking or slapping".   Although, I have never slapped either of my daughters, I do "believe in" and have spanked them as disciplinary action.  I believe there are also age appropriate guidelines that should also be followed when disciplining any child, regardless of gender.<br>  <br>  "Hitting a child, in anger, is never 'right'."|`|zLUQJxJkaa	No not a girl or any woman (unless she had a knife or was a terrorist).<br>  My daughter would depend on her age and what kind of striking.. a spanking at 4 years old would be fine, but not at 12. You also can't hit the child with any foreign object, that means you can only use your hand for spanking.. using a foreign object is illegal.<br>  No hits to the face either.<br>  In terms of anything else no, a man should never hit a woman. If he does he's a coward.|`|AA11522944	This is always a very controversial subject.<br>  <br>  My wife and I disciplined our boys with smacking but there had to be a serious reason for doing it... usually when they were hurting each other.<br>  <br>  I don't think either of them got 'smacked' after about age 10.<br>  <br>  It is a parents responsibility to control their anger and not 'lash out' unjustly or as a result of their own frustration.|`|nsVbWXKraa	the only time, and I do mean only time hitting a girl is the following..... When u are married and the WOMAN is always hitting u, kicking u out of the house, kicking u out of the car and have u sit in the sun for no reason just cause she is mad, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  All these things and more happened to my uncle during his first marriags, she was the abusive one.... he should have ended it sooner but continued it for 5 years..... that is unacceptable... in this instance I believe that the man must stick up for himself and only defned himself, not attack..... if hitting her is the only way to stop her from attacking then by all means do it but only until she gets away or off to wear u can leave and get help... other wise she will scratch and hurt u if she is the abusive type... only then it is acceptable...<br>  as for u though he should not be hitting u, like beating, abuse..... Now if she did soemthing wrong, is a snob, etc. etc. then a good put u over his knee and spank you I believe that to be acceptable, maybe a slap in the face but not a full blow puch u know..... Its called parenting and it isn't easy.... but just to hit someone because u are mad does not make it right... and he should not ABUSE U..... dicipline u yes but not ABUSE....|`|cr2KKT6Naa	no. a little spanking sometimes is sometimes the only thing a kid understands. but  a spanking shouldnt of ever have to happen either. if you talk to your kids when they are young. they do understand right from wrong. i never had to spank my daughter. i did slap her hands one time when she was shutting off the tv  all the time. one slap to the hand and that ended. i said no many times before that. good luck on your kid|`|KchNxZ6yaa	Nooo Why Would You Hit Someone You Love Men Who Hit Women Are Cowards **** Dem|`|oC11Lcf2aa	No. It's psychologically damaging and not necessary.|`|ehnxg6Utaa	no and not my sons either|`|a1YedErQaa	I don't think it is right or civil to hit anyone, be it male or female, people should be more sensible.<br>  <br>  Discipline wise, 'spanking' I could see being necessary for a younger child. Usually the spanking phase with children ends when they are reaching the age of double digits(10+).|`|ET7BftMpaa	No way!  There are a lot of ways to show your anger or disapproval besides hitting someone.  A man should never hit a woman unless it is self defense with a woman holding some sort of weapon but even then, I think I would be reluctant to hit a girl/woman.|`|X14vFTaiaa	like if I had a kid and just hit them for just being pissed, no, it's wrong, but in discipline, I feel it works, you tell a kid not to play with a power cord, he does anyways, spank him, don't just tell him again.|`|k7YMROOBaa	no because it breakes up thier relationship and if u are married u prob will endup with a worse relationship and get divorse
xTm5hK4vaa	Yes, you should be fine 19 hours apart.|`|Tc23KWgzaa	What does it say on the bottle?  I suspect that you can take two tablets every 4 hours, no more than 6 tablets in a day.<br>  <br>  Don't take it within 4 hours of bedtime.  Excedrine works really well because it has caffiene in it.<br>  <br>  TX Mom
gr4IFLsMaa	This is just how you will feel during the beginning stages of the medication.  It should wear off as you adjust to the medication.  If it doesn't the dosage or timing of the dosages could be adjusted.  You will not feel like this forever.  Just be sure to keep in contact with the doctor and be sure to let him/her know how you feel at each appt. and he/she will make the adjustments as needed.  I wish you best of luck and I hope the Seroquel works for you.|`|2eee3d9288232f099e9b265f904ce90aaa	If the tiredness doesn't improve in 2-4 weeks, you should talk to your doctor, you may need a lower dose, or a different medication.|`|qfuhHeDjaa	eventually you will even out on them as your system gets used to it but you may never feel like you do when not taking them...

wIpkGuRhaa	try drinking more water. water has a lot of benefits including speeding up your metabolism! try drinking 8-10 glasses a day and cut out sodas and sugary drinks I would not encourage adding more calories bc my husband said adding 400 calories a day is proven to make you gain 1 pound every 2 weeks so i would continue eating how you are and drinking plenty of water and also try to do higher intensity workouts and make sure your heart rate is in the cardio burning zone while working out!<br>  =)|`|JzY8x9Umaa	Dont eat more calories. Jog.
yXLDkKVIaa	Yes Water helps nicely|`|gbUKzTyVaa	drinking more water ALWAYS helps you lose weight, and it always helps you MAINTAIN A HEALTHY WEIGHT as well!<br>  <br>  that and a good nights sleep... extra crucial effort on the track, weight room, or basketball court/soccer field.... and eating a healthier, more balanced, more natural diet.|`|FEb0qWoVaa	Try the p90x program. They focus on exactly that. Muscle confusion and such. Have you seen any of the commercials? It seems like a fantastic program.
tq1eQwRZaa	I think you probably could lose weight with that, it just might take a while. Everything sounds delicious though, cuz im obsessed with healthy foods. My only suggestion is to replace the 1/3 less fat cream cheese with fat free cream cheese. In my opinion, it tastes just as good as the regular kind, but has only 30 calories in 2 tablespoons and no fat obviously.|`|eRzrH8vTaa	i lost 15 pounds in one week, restraining to eat 1 pop tart for breakfast, one small bag of chips, and an apple for dinner ;) haha, also never eat past 5 and you'll never gain any weight what so ever
0u79iDAvaa	pearl drops cause irreversable tooth abrasion (basicly sands them away to nothing)<br>  <br>  i would definatly advise colgate arm and hammer liquid calcium as it actually makes then stronger and fills in any cracks which would usually collect stain with calcium and keep them white and healthy.|`|n6XwqMELaa	its good, but there are many other whitining soloutions on the market now|`|cTszXzPjaa	Waste of time and money.

I am like that, and all of my friends who are women are like that as well.  Just look for women who look healthy, and generally speaking, you'll find someone who meets your standards.  <br>  Also keep in mind that a girl like that deserves a man you keeps care of himself.  If you want a beautiful, healthy woman, in all fairness, you need to be a beautiful, healthy man.  Lose some weight and treat your depression.  After all, your dream girl deserves a man that is just as dreamy as she is.  Good luck.
l8Xlae3paa	it depends. if its american chinese its unhealthy. its not even chinese its just...idk it doesnt even have flavor to me. there is so much grease and the chicken is gresey with fattning sauce that they tried to make better and the soy sause has tons of sugar and its just horrible. but chinese chinese is very healty..still depends on what you eat. like in america somethngs homemade can be unhealty like homemade hamburgers its better than bought but its still not very healty, however other dishes can be very healty. in china or asia, there are fattning homemade dishes but its way healthier than baught. but overall its mostly healthy.|`|taElYijzaa	If it is unhealthy, 1.3 billion would be weak today.<br>  But on the contrary, they have the fastest development of economy.|`|8SRjELNBaa	Wow, completely not true.  It depends on how you make it.|`|MDnqaQ9yaa	Depends on what kind of Chinese food you're talking about. If you mean the Chinese food from the corner or something, that is unhealthy. It has MSG in it and that's never good. Plus they precook everything before it's served to you, so there really isn't any nutrition in it. There's also a lot of soy in the food.<br>  If you mean REAL Chinese food, it's healthy, any home cooked meal is healthier than outside food.|`|qcgBsAhsaa	uhhh l love chinese food. it is not unhealthy.

Sometimes touching your boobs can help out if it doesn't weird you out.|`|1dec07efdeb7db57f7f679cacf79cb9baa	iono but maybe that is an orgasm..<br>  I like to stop just when im about to ***..and then keep going and stop again ect!

i6gTSnxLaa	i understand what your going through my mom is very sick (mentally) she tried to (well lets just say something really bad), my grandparents are dead and my dad doesn't want us. my brother is also always running away.<br>  <br>  i get depressed to, its ok life is bad with alot of people. some worse than others. im only i dont ndon't it will ever get better im still tryin tryinggure that out for myself, but you just got to try. your mom needs you, so does your brother. <br>  <br>  and your NOT pathetic. and your right you dont ndon'tother peoples sympathy cuz symapthy doesnt mean much it just means they feel bad for you doesnt mean they'll try to help. <br>  <br>  just hang in, dont run away like my brother did it may seem like its an easy way out but then u leave your little brother wounderin when you'll come back or why everythin is happening.<br>  <br>  like i said before just hang in there, i no it seems hopelss now but itll get better. people out there love you one way or another! your brother loves you so does your mom and dad. just because they may have (im not trying to be mean) a screwed up life doesnt mean you have 2 have one to!|`|8ul4UBPBaa	Yes there are a lot of us out here who have felt the way you do.  You are not alone.  You sound very depressed.  The first thing you need to do is make an appointment with your pediatrician.  When you talk with your doctor ask for a referral to see a mental health provider.  Your pediatrician  should be able to prescribe an antidepressant to get you through if necessary.  You will have to tell your mom, you need her help.   <br>  <br>  Trust me, you will start feeling better, and you will regain the strenght<br>  you need to get you through daily.   Don't be afraid.  I also went through things that no young girl should  go through. Lonliness was a big part of my life when I was growing up.   I only wish someone had given me the chance to see a specialist.  I also wish that I had access to the medicine they now have available to treat depression.  There are people out there who are going to problably say you should see a therapist and talk it out.  Therapy is very good, but it may take weeks or months before you start feeling better. It souds like you need help now. <br>  If you become determined to get better and suceed, you will, and the things you are going through will help make you stronger.

Bii5FvqLaa	I think that contacts are a great option! You should definitely consult your optometrist before purchasing any type of lenses.

It's easy for one person to look at the next and wonder, "How can they do that?" no matter what the difference is. <br>  For example, my daughter has ADHD. Before she was diagnosed, she couldn't understand how other kids could just sit and read without squirming and running. On the other hand, her friends wonder how she can come up with wild and funny ideas that are fueled by her ADHD. <br>  I have an aunt who has depression. She cannot understand how some people can just be happy when she cannot make herself happy for anything. Normal people wonder why she just doesn't snap out of it already and enjoy the good thing in life. <br>  As for people like us, we have a certain pattern or number in which we do things which is not unlike the same compulsion that causes my daughter to lose focus or my aunt to cry. It just happens and we have trouble shutting it off the way normal people can. <br>  It's as if our brains are faucets. Normal people get the models that are easy to turn and they don't leak.

6NZeItMAaa	with a low-fat diet you will lose your fat and have better health.<br>  <br>  FOODS TO AVOID<br>  <br>  SOUPS: All creamed soups are high in fat content. The commercially prepared ones are particularly fat-heavy, and since the fat cannot be readily removed from them, they should not be used. <br>  <br>  MEATS: Glandular organs such as sweetbreads, brains, kidneys, caviar, fish roe, and giblets are high in fat content and should be avoided. As already mentioned, liver is an exception to the list of glandular organs. It is desirable as a valuable nutritional source of essential vitamins and minerals, and because of the "protective" content of phospholipids that counteract the action of fat and cholesterol. <br>  <br>  FISH: Certain fish are high in fat and are best avoided. Bass, bluefish, butterfish, deviled crab, eel, herring, mackerel, scalloped or fried oysters, pompano, salmon, sardines, shad, and trout.<br>  <br>  DAIRY PRODUCTS: Whole milk, cream, butter, and cheeses such as American cheddar, Swiss, cream, creamed cottage, cheese spreads, Gruyere, Edam, Limberger, Liederkranz, Parmesan, Roquefort, and Yogurt made from whole milk are all high in fats and should be eliminated.<br>  <br>  EGGS: Egg yolks are exceptionally high in cholesterol and fat content. They are often used by medical investigators and researchers to produce atherosclerosis and "hardening of the arteries" in experimental animals.<br>  <br>  BREADS: Hot breads, pancakes, waffles, coffee cakes, muffins, buns, doughnuts, Danish pastry, sweet rolls—all contain some appreciable amount of lard, butter, or egg yolk. Those especially interested in home baking can find recipes for these fat-free breads and pastries in low-fat cook books.<br>  <br>  DESSERTS: All those made with butter, egg-yolks, or cream, such as pies, cakes, pastries, cookies, custards, éclairs, gingerbread, shortcake, and puddings. Notoriously high in fat and cholesterol are ice-cream, parfaits, and frozen creams.<br>  <br>  Miscellaneous Foods<br>  <br>  Avocados, coconuts, nuts, chocolate, cocoa, fat contained in the usual salad dressings, gravies, and sauces are all very fatty. Animal fats, including lard and suet, should particularly be avoided in cooking. Frying should be completely eliminated in the preparation of foods, not only because of its high fat production, but also because of its unhealthy way of interfering with the normal digestion of foods and essential nutriments and vitamins, the irritating character and effect on the digestive tract of the fried fats, and the destruction of vitamins and essential foodstuffs in the food that is fried. Even vegetable fats are best not used. An exception can be made for vegetable oils such as soya oil, corn seed oil, and cottonseed oils.<br>  <br>  Alcohol has no fat content, so there are no restrictions on its use other than by the dictates of common sense and self-control. Don't forget that the calories in liquors can easily mount up!|`|CHyStlDZaa	more fruits and veges for fiber and exercie and u shouldnt be eating 6 small one. eat 2-3  big meals (like a plate of steak or whatever) and exercise and stretch before u exercise cuz u might pull something. i hope it helps. oh! and just so that u dont snack, chew on sugar free gum because it distracts u from eating :)

62606e92b3ab21e8b1abda7881267fceaa	I have had an ovarian cyst and the consultant said not to worry as it will go its self After an ultra sound the cyst had shrivelled and i have no more pain,|`|woOeYFrEaa	I've had ovarian cysts.<br>  <br>  They are not related to endometriosis at all so no worries there.  Ovarian cysts are very, very common.  Many women get them and don't even know it.  Probably the only way they would impact your fertility is if you had PCOS (Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome).  In that condition, your body never ovulates normally, it forms cysts every time.  If you just have one cyst on your ovary, you probably don't have PCOS.<br>  <br>  I'd wait to talk to your doctor, but I definitely wouldn't worry about your ability to have children in the future.  Cysts are just a very minor malfunction that can happen when you ovulate.  Basically your body prepares multiple eggs at once and the best one is chosen to be dropped into your uterus during your cycle.  The other eggs are told to self-destruct and something happens and one of them doesn't get the message and forms a cyst.  Usually not dangerous or harmful.<br>  <br>  Hang in there!  I know its scary but you really have nothing to worry about.

HcS8vzNCaa	It appears that your parents are making you eat foods you prefer not to eat.  Obviously, you can't not eat anything or you would die.  <br>  <br>  If they are trying to force you to eat bad food--which is unlikely--you should sit down with them and explain this to them.  Do some nutrition research of your own, and, armed with that evidence. show them why certain kinds of foods they are serving aren't healthy.  Try to reason with them, to show them that you prefer healthier foods.  If they won't serve healthy foods, tell them that you can fix your own meals.<br>  <br>  However, if they are trying to serve healthy food to you, and you just don't like it, your case is weak.  Children often don't like vegetables, but it is up to the parents to serve them anyway.  If you don't get in  the habit of eating them when you're young, you will probably not eat them as an adult either, and your health will suffer.<br>  <br>  If it is the quantity of food that is in question, tell your parents that you are full, and can't eat any more after a certain point.  You can simply put your fork and knife on the plate and excuse yourself from the table. Don't forget to compliment the cook before you leave.<br>  <br>  "Delicious dinner, Mom," you might say.  "May I be excused?  I have a lot of homework to do."  Be assumptive. and stand up to get ready to leave the table.<br>  <br>  If you are simply not hungry at times, just reason  with your parents and tell them that you just dont' feel like eating now.<br>  <br>  If all of this fails, if they are simply unreasonable people who force you to eat no matter how you feel, you should go to your school counselor and ask her for advice.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with this.  Keep in mind that most likely your parents are trying to do the right thing, to raise you to be healthy and productive.  Take a look at photos of prisoners of war who have been starved to death, like the Jews at Auschwitz during World War II.    You don't want to end up like this, and if you don't eat, you will.|`|a44bdf9ab4b4445fd8c12378bca3da45aa	ok,<br>  i know i should be telling you how starvation is wrong and it won't help and etc but i'll just answer the question for ya<br>  <br>  "mom/dad, i've got homework" <br>  chuck it in a plastic bag and get rid of it when they're out or<br>  Tell them you're just eaten, like get a plate with crumbs leave it lying around.
rdKuvxYJaa	you have a imbalance in your diet of to much grain that are not whole wheat or whole grain. to much starch in one setting with eating potatoes and corn at the same time, and eating chocolate eclairs or anything in that category while trying to loose weight and build muscle is a huge NO NO.  stay away from fried foods period and eat your heaviest meals at lunch time instead of evening closer to bed time. drink at leased 8 8 oz of water every day and read your labels you will be surprised at what is added to canned goods and boxed things that are bad for trying to loose weight. measure your food and only eat a cup of each food and keep it all in moderation. the more protein you consume the more weight you will loose and the more muscle you will gain, speaking of that, muscle weighs more then fat but take up less space so instead of relying completely on the scale measure your weight loss by how you feel, how much more energy you have and how well your cloths fit or smaller change in the size of clothing you have to get to fit your body. and remember it wasn't over night that you put that weight on and wont take over night to take it off. you want to loose between 2 to 3 pounds a week and develop a healthy eating habit and lifestyle in order to keep it off for the rest of your life. good luck|`|3059c69d713a3b3f99a4757099599918aa	Sure it'll help, but you have to be patient and stick to it. If you're straining now find something more comfortable, or get into a routine of eating less. Walking/running is generally the best excercise to lose weight, and 6 small meals a day is good. Think about trying to substitute things in for butter and eat less carbs. But its good you're changing habits and you will deffinitly start losing weight. If you plan to work out do high reps 12-15 and around 3-4 sets to lose weight instead of gaining size. But keep it up it sounds like you're doing well, don't burn yourself out too early with the excercise though and vary what you do everyother day or so. Goodluck kiddo. Having an excercise partner as well will help you a great deal.

XgbIJkcmaa	That isn't the healthiest of all daily meal's but I would say about<br>  Chocolate pudding = 120 - 200<br>  The oasta varie because I don't know how much you ate but I would figure probably around = 400<br>  small chocolate bunny = 150<br>  vanilla pudding = 120 - 200<br>  <br>  Total 980 - 1140<br>  but you shouldn't worry about the calories, it's not the calories that make you gain weight it's the fat count of the food you eat.<br>  <br>  Hope This Helped! :D|`|STQuFtaYaa	I would say around 1500 calories, but it depends on the portion sizes. Its hard to tell without having seen what you ate. You might want to eat healthier though, seems like a lot of sweet stuff and no fruit or veggies.|`|nhgQKvwEaa	That's not very good diet food. You need to cut the chocolate out, and add fruits and veggies. You probably ate about 1,000 calories.|`|jsxphZJEaa	I cannot tell you how many calories as :<br>  I have not seen portions<br>  I have not seen ingredients<br>  However, this is an unhealthy diet, calories could range from 1000 - 3000+....depends on so many various factors, plus what did you drink? what side items? Is this all you ate?  I would suggest reading up on nutrition and obtaining bok on calories and foods.

Zs3SvoKfaa	try waiting a few more days, since it could just be a nasty bruise. sometimes bruised bones and sprains hurt more than clean breaks. make sure you try the r.i.c.e method. rest, ice, compression, and elevation. if the tingling goes away, that's good and it probably doesn't need to be examined by a doctor, but if it doesn't and it is still hurting you, it's probably best to get it looked at, even if it turns out it's not broken. <br>  hope it feels better!|`|5902755f27163f031c036cd6f0fc0367aa	I can answer this from my own repeated banging of my elbows.

If you don't, the antibodies could cause Grave's disease in the fetus. And when I say battle, I mean this will be a battle with your doctor. They don't like to cure Grave's disease. They usually won't test antibodies. But everyone with Grave's needs antibody testing. You can't stop meds until you are in remission - meaning that you have no antibodies.

Surely she won't tell you, it's just how things are now. You should ask if he has a journal, and if she doesn't, you should buy her one and tell her to write all of her thoughts down. Try not to put too much stress on her, or try to push her for answers, or even guess what's wrong for that matter. I never told my parents anything that was going on, but I wrote, and it really helped.|`|HQzUUnkBaa	Why do you think she's depressed? She could be, or she could be just going through the moody changes that come with growing up. If you really think she is, try talking to her about it. Ask her what's wrong, and spend some time together. If she doesn't want to talk to you, try talking to a close friend of hers before making any judgments on the situation. She'll be happy that you are concerned about her :)|`|sdkU1BWPaa	Take her to her doctor and get her on an antidepressant. Also, she should take a walk everyday out in the sun. About 15 minutes or so.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...</a>|`|818f0845593455a429e589978171c7bdaa	Cardio and lower your calorie intake.

oZpqEdI7aa	YOUR A MOM NOW!!!<br>  IT WAS OK WHEN EVERYONE LIKED YOUR BEHIND BEFORE BUT NOW ITS ABOUT PARENTHOOD!!<br>  GROW UP|`|nhgQKvwEaa	oh please. You have no butt, get over it. my advice, get fat. dunno.|`|I6dIkhbOaa	I have to laugh about the person that said the butt is mostly fat! Our butts are one of the largest muscles on our bodies! I used to do some of the original TaeBo workouts and some of the butt exercises on there did amazing things for me! The ones I remember most are getting on my hands and knees and lifting the leg out to the side MULTIPLE times (like probably 50 - 75) until I wanted to cry! That would make those nice divets in the side of the butt and push all the stuff to the back. Then the other (same thing, hands and knees), with your knee bent, lift your leg up behind you and then push it out straight. This lifts the butt up and rounds it out. You find the right exercise and it will stand that booty right up and round it out! It shouldn't take very long if you are already slim and do it every day to the point you want to fall down and cry! Nothing wrong with wanting a nice, round, hello! booty, I say! I know my husband loves mine!|`|YhYSZlroaa	you know, exercises are meant to lose weight, not get more. if you are thinking that you want it musle, well your "booty" is pro dominantley fat so sorry. I suggest that you go eat some bread|`|78eefad2fa8273a595fc47a0853b001baa	do some butt workouts|`|1dL6fU0Haa	1.  Squats<br>  Squats are a no-brainer and as they are clearly one of the best exercises for the legs, hips, butt, and thighs.  This involves the simple motion of standing up and sitting down over and over again.  With each movement, all of the muscles of your but are fully engaged and making sure you get a nice soft landing with each descent.  The deeper you go, the higher the intensity and the more you will feel the muscles tighten up!<br>  <br>  2.  Lunges<br>  <br>  Lunges are another great addition to any butt-wrenching workout as they help to isolate each individual leg.  Start by taking a massive step forward with one foot and then stop there.  Slowly bend both knees thereby lowering your back leg towards the floor and then right before your back knee touches, push yourself back up to the top and then repeat.  I would recommend you did 10 repetitions per leg 3 times each switching in between.  <br>  The only draw back to this one is that it can have an effect on the knees if this is a weak area for you so if you experience any pain while performing this one I suggest you skip it.<br>  <br>  3.  Glute’s<br>  One of my all-time favourites…Glute extensions are very effective at isolating the muscles in the butt region and helping to shape and form the area quite nicely.  Simply get down on all fours, take one leg and kick it back behind you over and over breathing out as you kick back.  Make sure to keep your head down and think about pushing something away from you with the heel of your foot!  For this one, I would recommend a repetition range of about 20 done consecutively for 3 sets.<br>  <br>  4.  Hip extensions<br>  This one will surely get your butt working…Start by lying down on your back with your knees bent.  With your hands down on either side of you, lift the butt as high as you can towards the ceiling!!!!  Hold it there for 2-3 seconds and then lower it back down to the starting position.  The higher you go the more you will feel it and make sure to squeeze the butt real tight at the top and then slowly drop it back down to the floor.  Repeat this 20 times squeezing it hard for 2-3 seconds at the top each rep and you will be one step closer to fitting into those nice form fitting jeans ;-)<br>  <br>  5.  Stiff-legged deadlifts<br>  This one is a little more difficult and more on the advanced side but once you can master it, the results will be worth it!  To start, stand up straight feet together.  Slowly bend over making sure to keep your knees absolutely straight!  Go as low as you can while keeping the back straight and arched, once you feel a pull behind the knees, make your way back to the starting position and then repeat.  To add resistance, hold a small weight in each hand and let your arms hang down as your bending forward.  Remember, it is crucial that you keep the back straight to feel this in the right spot.  If you feel it in the lower back, you’ve gone too far.  Do about 15 repetitions for 3 sets stretching the hamstrings between each set in order to prevent and cure a saggy butt!<br>  <br>  Don’t forget that on top of all this, to really add the finishing touches to a nicely shaped butt, I would strongly recommend you make an effort to also include about 2-3 hours of cardiovascular activity each week.  Whether on the bike, treadmill, elliptical or simply walking outdoors or playing your favorite sport, if you can work that into your program you will decrease the amount of fat in the surrounding butt area so as to really see your results pay off!|`|wIpkGuRhaa	there are a few exercises you can do i use to have a flat but and after doing these exercises i finally have a but!! I did straight leg dead lifts which is where you stand on something about 5 inches from the floor and pick up a workout bar while keeping your legs straight and bring it up to where your back is straight and bring it back down and back up and do 10 reps 3 times then you can do squats with a workout bar on your back and make sure you go as low as you can and do that 10 reps 3 times you can also do the workouts where you are on all fours (like a dog) and lift one leg back as far as you can 10 reps 3 times on both legs then lift one leg to the side and do 10 reps 3 times on both legs im not sure what that is called but we use to call it fire hydrant because you look like a dog when he pees on a fire hydrant plus since you are gaining muscle you are burning calories =)|`|jpVFYgHraa	lol
el8yX5q3aa	NOTHING....get some popsicles and try to drink some tea...but don't keep irritating things until the stomach settles down.

fd821b24200f8a88262c7fffef0051f1aa	Hi, from reading the above answers to your questions I had better give you some factual info on the subject.#Yes mercury is used as a filling material but a small amount is mixed with other metals and materials(amalgamated) hence the term amalgam filling. It is the strongest and longest lasting of the filling materials and also the hardest wearing. It also has alot less micro leakage due to shrinking over time(which means decay can form underneath a filling and you wouldnt be aware of it) this happens alot with with white(composite fillings). You are most at risk of exposure to mercury when you are having your filling placed and/or removed.It is stable inside the tooth. This is why they use suction when placing a filling to catch any loose pieces. There is no harden proof that mercury(amalgam) fillings damage your health. Its usually holistics who want all the poison out. <br>  Hope this helps|`|BDPc9P4Faa	Yes. People who have fillings don't even know that's where most of their health problems are coming from. <br>  They did a test, and took out a kids fillings who kept having heart problems, and put it in a rabbits mouth. That rabbit immediately died of a heart attack, and the kid stopped having problems.<br>  And no they aren't taking mercury out, thats what they're telling people but its a bunch of bull**** because people started questioning it. <br>   Its not the orthodontists fault, they only know as much as their taught in school. Its the people in charge of it all that know well what their doing. Just like they continue to put toxic sodium fluoride in our water and toothpaste and tell us its good for our teeth.|`|OD3FqMaKaa	yes i could never understand why they did that as when i was at school mercury was treated like a deadly poison as you say<br>  <br>  i think they are starting to change the mercury fillings, guess they originally needed metal that was soft enough to form fillings|`|0u79iDAvaa	The mercury is very minimal and holds the alloy together ( Amalgam ) which is the strongest filling material, and although there is mercury in the amaglam it does not cause any damage while it is in your mouth because it is contained within the tooth and the filling.<br>  <br>  while they are putting the filling in there is very slight vapour from it but you would have to get hundreds of fillings for it to make a difference,<br>  p.s - you get more mercury from a tuna sandwich than a filling.|`|4CQf9G4kaa	I didnt think they put mercury in fillings anymore. Yes, it is poisonous to humans, that's why they removed it from those glass themometers the dr used to stick in your mouth when you were ill...  milliners used to be driven crazy by using it when making hats... that's were you get the phrase 'mad hatter' from....<br>  <br>  hope some of my ramblings helped! :)|`|Hx2YtXykaa	They don't any more.  It's a banned substance.
kDvKc3npaa	Try NuvaRing.<br>  <br>  I don't know what the ParaGaurd is but NuvaRing is just a ring you put up there once a month, take it out for a week and put a new one in, there really isn't much to remember and it doesn't effect your daily life.<br>  <br>  You can have sex just the same and don't have to worry about it misplacing itself since it just goes up inside the vagina and doesn't need a specific spot

You should be getting it soon, maybe not this month, but fairly soon... you're body is gearing up for it and the hormones are working overtime. <br>  <br>  You may want to ask your mom about these things too, she can give you a good idea of how things will probably go for you, as she has already been through it.<br>  <br>  Don't rush it, you're still young and when you do get a full period, your periods are probably going to be irregular and may not even come every month for awhile.<br>  <br>  Irregularity is normal for the first few years.  Then you get to the point where you can basically predict when and how long.|`|x9fuxbrMaa	I would wait and see mine was really light the first time you need to calm down(not sarcastic) wait it out if you are the kinda of girl who talks with her mom about everthing but ask her, if you ar afraid of leaaking put a little peice of toilet papper down, it could of actally been over that fast so you might not see it for another month so stay calm|`|HDnZlQDYaa	not to sound nasty or anything, but theres no other normal way i can say this, when you get your period sometimes it looks brownish and nasty at first when i first got my period i thought i pooped myself but then i relized i didnt soo, that sounds really nasty but thats the truth , so it may be your period.|`|J9GUBU3zaa	Sweetie, tell your mom!

Well u might not start right away after u saw that brownish stuff. b'cuz wen i was 10 i got soo happy and anxious because there was a little blood in my underwear wen i went to the bathroom. i got soo mad wen i didnt start right away, well a few weeks l8r i did. So dont get ur hopes up..... or enjoy the time u hav b4 u start ur period. I think its completely normal. but once u do start ur period u should start like really soon after u c brownish discharge. o and dont worry if it comes and its not very heavy, it may b like that the first few times. Also if u dont have 1 every month thats very common for the first year or 2 (trust me i would know mine dont come the same time every month).            If it does this for a while (the brown-orange-red thing) and u dont start then tell ur mom and ask if its normal.                                       Hope i helped!!! =)

nyGz0Q9Daa	ok 2 years ago i was 11 years old 5'8 and 225 pounds. now I am 13 years old 5'11 and 160 pounds. everyone thinks i had surgery I didn't tho. Ok i rode my bike a lot over the summer. And cut out all fatty foods . I know that part sounds hard but it is not. instead of burgers try ham or turkey wraps. At subway get a wrap or veggie delite. They are actually pretty good. Try to fit in the occasional salad. JOIN A SPORT! that is important soccer,softabll,basketball,track,swim anything really. you just have to eat healthier and excercise. Hope that helps :)|`|f26Vbwo9aa	You should eat really really healthy with no cheats that is, you should exercise a lot like 60 minutes a day, and NOT WORRY ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT!

EqfWi7Ohaa	Not usually unless it is caught very early on. Flushing your system with lots of cranberry juice and taking cranberry tablets sometimes can change the ph of your urine so as to cause the bacteria to die and be shed easier.|`|AA11280073	No. They get worse. Infections don't heal themselves.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	A urinary tract infection in your bladder can grow and spread to your kidneys. Untreated infections can cause more problems than simply treating them. <br>  <br>  Go to the doctor.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Not really.<br>  The key is once you start noticing the symptoms, drink LOTS of cranberry juice. Don't waste your time on getting the junk cranberry juice they sell in conventional stores. I am talking about the PURE cranberry juice that you get in health food stores. It's a little pricey but it does the job. The juice in grocery stores are usually watered down crap and serves no purpose if you are drinking it to treat a UTI.<br>  I get them (UTIs) occasionally and this is how I treat myself without resorting to see a doctor who will eventually prescribe me antibiotics which damage your flora.
VmiLwLt7aa	Any drug can cause this... If he's blowing tree (marijuana) he'll likely be happier around you while high but that doesn't normally make people act angry afterward. <br>  <br>  My guess would be meth/crack and depending on where you live I can make a better guess of which of the two it is (meth is more prevalent in rural/white areas crack more urban areas). I doubt it is heroin or you'd see your friend getting very sick frequently when he was out of money/heroin for a couple days (by sick I mean VERY sick, throwing up, etc...).<br>  <br>  I doubt he's popping vicodin or percasets because they usually just mellow the hell out of a person more than make them up beat and friendly. However, a strong addiction of percs and/or dalaudid (I doubt he's on dalaudid, an addiction to that would run him hundreds a week) could cause similar withdrawal as witnessed in Heroin.<br>  <br>  I'm not too familiar with coke addiction so maybe that's a possibility too... I heard it can cause drastic mood swings and the type of high is dependent on the person.<br>  <br>  But yeah, my guess is meth or crack if he's on something. Then again he may just be going through a tough time in his life or aggravated with something which is causing these mood swings?|`|jy52NZEjaa	okay, probably adderall, ritelin, or cocaine. =/ people usually isolate themselves when on these drugs. and it well split your mind like crazyyy.|`|25d446cf62508e0d3ad669755f76bfb8aa	Most all drugs, legal or illegal can cause mood or personality changes in some people. Talk to your friend when he's in a good mood, but don't accuse him of anything. Listening to what he has to say may clue you in to what is going on.|`|fF1WbPltaa	All of the recreational drugs are mind altering and can cause mood swings.
3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	To lose weight (fat), include more fibrous slow digesting carbs, as opp. to the fast digesting ones. <br>  <br>  No white breads, fast foods, sodas (not even diet) no ketchups, sugar, only skim milk, not 2%, skim and whole grain non sweet (sugary) cereal, whole wheat bread, maybe buy some soy or whey protein.<br>  <br>  Include lean meats like ham, and other sources of protein. Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging. Be active!<br>  <br>  Jog stairs ;and also do some lunges until it burns, do this every day or 2 days, keep going and don't give up, same with eating, you need some fat, so one or two fish oils daily.<br>  <br>  Eat fish (not fried, be careful, very careful for bones) Peanut butter on whole wheat (no jelly), which has protein, and don’t worry about the fat in that. Avocados, has fat, good fat; eat it when your hunger cravings get you. <br>  <br>  When you do crunches, also twist on some to work your sides, keep tension on your abs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Need more info, go to bodybuilding.com|`|03g0WSvZaa	try the Lil Jack workout  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezris" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKCGe2Ezr...</a> its fun and it works|`|AA10085558	Acai Berry Blast is the world’s #1 SUPER FOOD!

AA12208063	Starving yourself would be eating fewer calories than your base metabolic rate.  So yes, you can eat some and still be starving yourself.|`|pquw7AdQaa	it means consuming a very little amount of calories!<br>  I suggest you do some research or read someone's story online before you strve yourself|`|1CqTmAVXaa	Starvation is a severe reduction in vitamin, nutrient, and energy intake, and is the most extreme form of malnutrition. In humans, prolonged starvation (in excess of 1-2 months) causes permanent organ damage[citation needed] and, eventually, death. The term inanition refers to the symptoms and effects of starvation.<br>  <br>  Individuals experiencing starvation lose substantial fat (adipose) and muscle mass as the body breaks down these tissues for energy. Catabolysis is the process (medical condition) of a body breaking down muscles and other tissues in order to keep vital systems working – vital systems such as the nervous system and heart muscle

There are plenty of websites you can search in that will show you where it is and what to do. you're not a slut, you're just discovering yourself. sometimes actually putting something inside you is not enough. You're more likely to climax from clitoral stimulation.
0ff94ba9320182f79127dc5f55cbcaefaa	I've already tried to answer your other question - will ask the same question about pain management here: <br>  <br>  What did the pain management doctor do? Have you tried antidepressant or anticonvulsant drugs? Both of these drug types are well known to help with nerve pain. Has anyone ever mentioned something like a spinal cord stimulator to you? Ketamine? Desensitisation therapy for your foot? <br>  <br>  I know how much it hurts to be touched, but you HAVE to work on that or it's only going to get worse. Start out with something really soft, like cotton wool, and gently brush it against your skin. Increase the pressure and the coarseness of the materials you use as you are able to tolerate it. I know it hurts - I've lived this disease since I was 14 years old. I'm now 24 and completely crippled by it.  <br>  <br>  Have you ever tried Mirror Imagery, as I asked in your other question topic? It sounds bizarre, but try it. Sit with a mirror between your legs so that your painful foot is hidden from view - all you see is your good foot, and a reflection of your good foot. Practice gentle movements of your good foot while watching your 'bad foot (i.e. the reflection) do those same movements in the mirror. It helps some people with CRPS and in other neuropathic pain syndromes, and it can't hurt to try it.<br>  <br>  EDIT: I'm really sorry to hear that. Have you looked at a spinal cord stimulator or intrathecal pump - both are implants that go into your spine, but help your limbs. SCS in particular is designed to help nerve pain.
o1LD5pXAaa	I suffered from bulimia, depression and self harm myself for just under a year and I know what it feels like to be aware of every ones opinion of you. The mst important thing is that you need to not judge yourself; bulimia and anorexia are more physiological than anything. There is no norm for this type of thing and no one is going o judge you for the way you're feeling.<br>  <br>  You should be so proud of yourself for trying to take action against this problem, seeing as most people in this situation are unable to realise this for themselves.<br>  <br>  With your eating habits, i would suggest seeing a doctor. This way, you can get advise on where your weight should be, how to keep yourself healthy and how to tackle all of the other problems that come with under eating.<br>  <br>  Personally, I found counselling helpful with my depression and self harm. I was reluctant to seek medication as anything that can be prescribed is addictive, but there are herbal tablets you can buy that life your moods and as stupid as it sounds they really do work to an extent. <br>  <br>  To me it just sounds like you need to rebuild your wn confidence and self worth before you're going to be strong enugh to tackle all of this, so whether that is something you feel you need to do alone, through friends or through a third party, it's not as hard as it seems. <br>  <br>  Like I said, the fact that you want to sort this out for youself proves you really do have a lot to be proud of, you just need to remeber no one is going to judge you.<br>  <br>  I really hope everything works out for you, sorry if this really wasn't helpful<br>  x|`|PRCfCSDxaa	Keep telling yourself you're normal.<br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and go see a doctor.|`|he7D7huDaa	ive had bulimia and depression and come out the other side my friend so ther is light at the end of the tunnel but i tell you now i didnt find help in doctors or shrinks they try but in my mind i just did no good for me. i just learn to live with the way i am and yep days do come up when i look and think om fat but i just dont care anymore i would rather think im fat or i am fat than go through that again. hope you sort ya self out soon and you find your own way to cope with your problem thats all <br>  i can say. see thats the same response you get from the doctors as them jerks that have answerd you just eat more. for those of you who say just eat more SHUT UP YOU DONT KNOW WHAT YOUR ON ABOUT.|`|zU1hrRIgaa	You keep asking us not to judge you, when you're judging yourself! There is no such thing as "normal". Stop trying to catagorize yourself. <br>  <br>  A) EAT SOME FREAKING FOOD<br>  <br>  B) Talk to someone! Don't go poking around online for help.

AA11481224	not linked you need more fiber in your diet<br>  <br>  eat more whole grains and nuts|`|DRSv6SOLaa	I would get a check-up if it continues!  (Use some fiber in the mean time!)  :)|`|Rb3MmzKlaa	It could be b/c of a messed up period, yes.  Check w/ a doctor if it keeps going though.
PRCfCSDxaa	I'm dieting right now, too. Basically, I'm doing the same thing except I'm not lifting weights hehe, I'm just toning. Drink LOTS of water...I wish I could emphasize more on water because the more you drink, the more helps it does for you and your weight loss. Try to get some cardio (Dancing is my favorite) in there. It'll help burn tons of fat/calories and boost up that metabolism. Also do lots of jump rope, or anything that keeps you jumping. Don't eat after 9 PM because that's when your metabolism works at it's slowest pace. Special K is a good source of food to eat whenever you are hungry, too.|`|pquw7AdQaa	try doing high intensity interval workouts they're short and keep your metabolism high for up to 36 hours!<br>  also try searching "Negative calorie foods"|`|85KrSJh3aa	I suggest you use a natural system to help you lose the weight you want.

xBgKqAPHaa	I use a product called Maximum Teeth Whitening . You order it over the internet. For like $30 AUD you get 2 syringes of the whitening gell, instruction booklet and a moulding thing for your teeth and instructions on how to do it. Its easy, pretty quick and great value for money compared to some of the things around. I did heeps of looking around the internet before i ordered.<br>  <br>  It has worked great for me, i put it in my mouth now and then just to keep my smile white. I liked it so much that i have re-ordered it since finishing my last lot!<br>  I get lots of compliments on my white teeth and this is the baby to thank!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.maximumteethwhitening.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.maximumteethwhitening.com/</a>|`|vvVV7xvaaa	The crest whitening paste that you put on at night with an applicator brush worked quite well for me and it is relatively in expensive.

If you think pain will help relieve your stress, there isn't anything in the world like the burn of a good work-out.  Take your iPod and blast music, or just listen to the sounds of the world going by.<br>  <br>  The best part about this?  It's a healthy pain.  You'll be sore, some days, and out of breath.  But overall, the health benefits are fantastic.  When you exercise, your body releases hormones called endorphins, and they can give you a happy feeling; kinda like a *high.*  And trust me, being addicted to running will be so much better than being addicted to cutting yourself.<br>  <br>  I hope things work out for you, sweetheart. xoxo
9pLdhuBnaa	You need to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they think could be causing this, but even before doing that I would recommend letting your mom know what's going on so that she can help you keep an eye on the situation.
HltEZkvQaa	The first thing you'll notice is that you start to feel different (balance wise- a bit like being drunk).<br>  <br>  Then shortly afterwards you'll get this slight sense of wonder. The world will seem slightly different but everything will look the same.<br>  <br>  Thoughts will flow more freely (which could lead to paranoia if you're in a negative setting). If you close your eyes you'll find it's easier to see things you imagine.<br>  <br>  You may get tingly feelings on your skin (feels good, not bad).<br>  <br>  You'll start to feel warm and fuzzy like there's an invisible bubble around you. You'll notice that nice things feel nicer (music, chocolate ect). You should smoke it with other people. If you start laughing it'll feel better than ever before, and you'll find yourself laughing <br>  uncontrolably at things that normally would only seem slightly funny.<br>  <br>  Your mouth will probably feel dry (coz of the smoking) so you'll want to have a drink with you. Also munchies aswell.<br>  <br>  trace amounts will stay in your system for up to 3 months.|`|GaLw1qMwaa	the first time you will get paranoid because you will hear your heart beating really fast.  once you realize you cant die from pot you will then laugh ALOT , your eyes will feel heavy , and then you will get hungry , and then you pass out.  it will only stay in your system a week maybe, if that. its not like it will take alot to work.|`|UqWHXO16aa	the bad- you get the munchies like crazy and might end up eating more than you eat, you get paranoid, and you get thirsty bc your throat burns a bit.<br>  <br>  the good- its fun, makes you relaxed, makes you happy. :) and thats it lol|`|e9d744730c1945534ece9c6d73f61f0eaa	I've never tried it and I'm not sure if I ever will, but it sounds like it is nice.<br>  I can't imagine that inhaling any type of smoke is good for you, but I heard that marijuana isn't that bad for you. But at the same time I've heard the exact opposite. The smoke I would imagine could really damage the lungs and throat, but if its only once or twice, I can't see that being a problem. I know that pot really helps with pain and stress management, so those are some good things, other than just the high.<br>  <br>  One last bad thing, it's illegal. Getting caught could be very bad in the future. Even if its just once or twice that you did it, if you get caught, most people don't care. Also it comes up on drug tests for months and months after it was actually smoked.<br>  <br>  In the end, there are a lot of bad things, and a few good things, but I guess the high makes it worth is to a lot of people.|`|xb6uZrluaa	Ok the bad for one is that it is totally illegal so if he wants to risk getting arrested to get high then go for it but if he is that resposible he wont touch it.<br>  The good I would have to say would be that it is totally relaxing, everything is more beautiful and funny. If you only smoke once and don't become avid about it it will only stay in your system for two weeks instead of a month.<br>  But be carefull if you smoke to much NO YOU WONT DIE but your head will be so dizzy it can easily make you nautious but usually some cold water will fix this|`|dmvpmLVSaa	Smoking pot is not bad in any way shape or form. If it is your first time, it will be hard to actually get high, but its different for everyone. In the morning he might be a little brain farted but it soon goes away. I suggest for his first time to smoke a **** load and listan to green grass and high tides by the outlaws. Another song to listan to would be freebird by lenard sykynard.|`|XGPML3Lsaa	its good stuff. you'll feel calm relaxed but ur mind feels a little cloudy..like that feeling when something is on the tip of your tongue but u can't quite remember it..not in a bad way really..youll feel more creative and think ideas (good or bad) that make sense while ur high that u wouldn't have though of if you weren't high .....There are no bad side effects of doing it just a few times and it doesnt make u stupid.  I just got my bachelors degree and  I am in grad school and I smoke occasionally and im fine.. everyone is different htough i guesss  ... also u get hungry and it makes food taste better|`|6zCalKvKaa	It depends what the experiment is if he is just going to smoke it he could die from smoke inhalation or overdose. It can also make you pregnant.|`|jITZS1j5aa	He will feel very calm but also dizzy|`|6Ss31wyBaa	He will get very paranoid.|`|SO7zRZK9aa	One or two times will no negative affects at all, assuming you aren't stupid enough to get caught.
ETbb9BfSaa	I understand where you're coming from. Some of the people posting on here post a picture and just want a good review, they know it's a good picture of themselves.<br>  <br>  But, you need to realize that in some cases, the fact of the matter is, even though people may be tall and appear to have a lower weight, the majority of their "weight" may be actually made up from fat and adipose tissue. Others on the other hand, simply lack the self-confidence needed to see themselves in a positive way, and have a poor self image of themselves, which is another issue within itself.
UymjYnGHaa	Most Gyms should do, you will only be allowed to use the CV machines no weights until you are 14 /15 i think. I am 15 i went throught this stage and my brother has just joined my gym and he is 13 as well lol :) Hope this helps xxx|`|aIakDSstaa	A lot of the council run gyms have what they call "resistance"equipmentt, this doesnt use weights and is suitable for teenagers to use. Id try your local leasure centre first.|`|f4WVWNxuaa	My local leisure centre does a under 16 membership to their gym, you can use the gyms at certain times and only certain machines, you might wanna check out things like that.|`|gHyu4Hqaaa	Some council run lesuire centers in London one day a week where school age children are allowed to use the gym.

There are loads of temptations in the real world don't you think?! The sole thing that clearly worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a few free trials left, it was reported in Reader's Digest and CNN. I shed twenty pounds, it clearly does work!|`|AYIEpXCOaa	If you want a really general and broad idea where you fit in, just find a website or a health book that has a Body Mass Indicator (BMI). It does dictate fat mass of muscle mass, it just says either you are underweight, in-the-right-area-weight, overweight, and obese. Hope that helps.|`|726c39d028b26cddd2db5c6325f9c0e4aa	I am 5' 8" and 145, I am actually kinda skinny (apart from a bit of a gut).

bxxwhP04aa	The colonoscopy is the very best diagnostic tool there is, and if any abnormalities are found, they are corrected right then and there.  The virtual colonoscopies are NOT accurate, they missed four polyps of mine several years ago.|`|224d1d60d1b56362532d0d7f33ab994daa	Do you mean that screens for colon cancer? Yes, a virtual colonoscopy, or CT scan, is used. <br>  <br>  However, the advantage of traditional colonoscopy is that if polyps are found, they can be removed at the very same time. If they are seen under CT scan, a colonoscopy must be scheduled. 2 procedures required in that case, vs. 1 with conventional scope.<br>  <br>  Fecal occult test detects blood in stool, but is nowhere near as good at catching early precancerous lesions.|`|2OQuDVYvaa	The gold standard is the colonoscopy.  Next would be a barium enema; however, like the virtual colonoscopy you may miss potential polyps and if any polyps are found you need to have a colonoscopy to remove the polyps.<br>  <br>  That's why the colonoscopy is the best choice.
mC2PXK4Faa	im 14 and smoke everyday but im not addicted. i could stop whenever id wanted. its called a stoner, not an addict|`|ot0WW8lZaa	Don't listen to them. It's impossible to be "addicted" to weed. Some may say you can get "psychologically addicted", but in the same retrospect, you can also become psychologically addicted to video games. Once every week won't make you get a dependence. And you only crave it because you like it. I smoke everyday and I could stop any time I want. And I don't wanna hear "That's what all addicts say", because I had to stop for an entire five years when my job did extreme testings for it and I had no problem stopping. Prior to this I smoked everyday for 15 years. I've been smoking since I was 13. I do not work at burger-king. I am a former garbage man and am now a supervisor that makes 100k a year just to drive around and make sure garbage men are doing their job. I'm far from a failure and make more money that many who have chosen a life of sobriety. I don't have anything against that, of course, but I'm just saying that bud isn't a "gateway drug" and does not **** up your life like the media says it does.|`|7MXNwFaHaa	OK weed will kill u and u will have to go through a hard very hard time in your life if u keep doing it and all most impossible to get out of try to find something different to do like instead of doing weed go with your bff ( one friend that does not do weed ) and have a sleep over and talk about something different and think about it it is making your life harder and your family if u have not told them plzz do they can lead u to the right place but then u have to make the decision to keep making the right chose plzz do the right thing|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	I smoked pot for years before I got married and had kids. You are sort of addicted in a small way, but you can walk away from it. I did, and it took about 60 days but then I did not miss it any more. It is a lot easier habit to kick then hard drugs or cigarettes, or alcohol.<br>  and you really should stop. That stuff is hell on your lungs.|`|wWTOjCcoaa	ur addicted to the high, it usually happens when you find being sober really boring and you just want to be high to  make thing feel better. i smoke everyday, usually before i go to sleep.|`|6cc543542598d9c7bc967e59c411667aaa	R u STUPID? Your 13, get a better habit. Like read maybe??? You need to stop. It is addictive, My ex is very addicted and has been smoking since he was 14, he is now 43 and can't go a day without it, without having panic attacks. So if you care about yourself you will just stop NOW.|`|uNd6OPCdaa	yeah <br>  i do it everyday<br>  started when i was eleven now i am 15|`|RYf3sf6Daa	u usually cant get addicted to weed<br>  but once every weekend is probably the most u should do|`|C2mhU9CKaa	no. and everyone who said yes is stupid. and yes weed does harm your body but ive talked to several doctors who have all told me that everything it kills grows back in a maximum of 7 years. But i smoked weed almost every day since i was 10 to when i was 17. Weed is really hard to become addicted to, i walked away from it after 7 years of it. And it can actually help with alot of things, im bipolar, have ocd, and chronic anxiety and i didnt have to use any medicine while i was toking everyday. its the first 4 days of quitting that usually gets people but after that its not too hard.|`|BYRbBw2uaa	Depends on if you have a predisposition in your family to be an addict. Meaning, if you have alcoholism on your Mom or Dad's side of the family you have a good chance.<br>  <br>  What you need to look at is why you want to get high or alter your mental state. At your age it could lead to more devastating consequences as you get older.|`|2cnSGnyHaa	NO.<br>  its normal to crave it. you are not addicted yet.<br>  id say you wont get addicted unless you start getting baked everyday and go through withdrawl syptoms when you dont smoke.<br>  trust me.<br>  just be careful, you are young.<br>  otherwise have fun and dont get caught:)|`|vbAq8GkOaa	yeh who cares dude youll start smoking every day and getting high before school...its not a bad thing trust me especially once you get into highschool youll see how many kids smoke buds everyday... being a stoner is a fun life as a teenager just dont get caught ha|`|U91xlYS8aa	No, you can't get addicted to it. Craving it is something natural. Haven't smoked it in a couple months and I'm craving it =)<br>  Anyways, you're kind of young to smoke weed|`|fQh5Qkkkaa	Weed is impossible to get addicted to.<br>  <br>  You can crave it because you like it,<br>  but it has no physical addiction.|`|L4XrL4v5aa	I think you are starting to get addicted..<br>  my friends do it every day.. and if they miss a day they don't feel good and get head aches...

I just can't believe how stupid people are saying how smoking weed will screw up your life forever lol. I honestly think you're a little young to be smoking but not your not really addicted. Marijuana is less addicting then caffeine and sex in reality. It's a very safe drug to be using but if you crave it that's not such a good sign. That probably means your having problems in your life and you feel the need to be on a substance. Marijuana is a valid medicine for depression though so maybe its not the worst thing using it occasionally.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Although im not against weed, you are too young to be smoking it.<br>  Wait until your old enough to know the consequences of your actions.<br>  I personally think weed should be treated as alcohol.|`|r1Vg6djRaa	ok seriously David and the dude underneath him are 2 of the FEW  people  here who REALLY KNOW what they are talking about.<br>  <br>  dont listen to any of the dumbass people who say weed is gonna kill you bla bla bla. they all need to educate themselves on the matter.<br>  <br>  im craving choclate chip cookies right now does that mean im a addicted to cookies?|`|ja1tMj3Aaa	Yep and have fun working your way up to assistant manager at Burger King when you are 35.|`|JiRa3lgkaa	yessssssssss|`|MU8Z9pIPaa	I agree with Life...

azxbIaVfaa	depending on what grade you're in, grades can/can't affect on the job you get, and the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  I just moved to Maryland two years ago this August. I used to go to a Montessori school where they don't really test you, only on the worldwide things. Now I go to a much better school. I used to do really bad on my tests. But recently, I have been doing really well in every class. I guess my point of this, is that it just takes time and a lot of studying. A few studying tips: don't study for like 3 hours straight, take a few 10-15 minute breaks to do whatever you want, but only 10-15 minutes b/c then you might not get back to your work. Try having a schedule and write down your homework and any events you have that day. Try to plan, when you will do what, including studying for tests. Also, if you have exams, keep all your tests and quizzes and other notes, in a exam binder so that when exam time comes, everything is organized.<br>  <br>  Calming down: during 10-15 minute breaks, try listening to some relaxing music, maybe get a small snack, get a drink,<br>  <br>  I hope I helped|`|flaOQzZoaa	Oh dear hun that is not good at all. The fastest and most effective technique you can use (which you can actually do yourself when you get upset and stressed) is EFT - you can download a free manual of how to do it on yourself at the official website www.emofree.com. It has like a 95% success rate. I actually run stress classes and the results we get with EFT is incredible.<br>  <br>  Some of the issues you are talking about might be trickier to do on your own - but still try it anyway - im confident it will help you. I offer telephone or web therapy too if you need it.  If you get stuck or need help or advice get in touch - you can go to my website too which has more info and some videos on EFT which will hlep you get started.<br>  www.thelife-clinic.com<br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  <br>  Kelly.|`|2d09327ea4cd614cbb7db85428b4dd5eaa	Jesus Christ.

Also, just forget about everything and take some time to loosen up. As for your grades, just do your work and feel confident about it. you'll pass if you just trust it.

I think her insulin dosage needs reviewing and the mother needs to see a dietitian to educate her. <br>  <br>  I can see that you are in a very awkward position. Is the child at school? Perhaps a word with the school nurse might help? <br>  <br>  There is no excuse for a mother to be so ignorant in this day and age. If that child end up dead which she will do if something isn't done, it will be nothing short of manslaughter.|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	If these things are not low carb or sugar free or diet, take some controll. Invite her over more often, give her healthier snacks. And hopefully she'll become more fond of these foods, and ask her mom to get them instead of the other things. In someway, this is child abuse (her mother, not you! :)) and if you go to a doctor soon, ask him/her for tips.

AA11307345	Just talk about it! The best plan is to say what you heard to your father, and help him understand what you're going through. If you don't want to talk directly to somebody (I probably wouldn't!), join an online forum or makes online friends with IM. Then, just talk it out with your buddies, behind anonymity. <br>  <br>  I know you must be going through hard times, but if it comes to you thinking about committing suicide immediately, tell your brother or father about it. He may say you're a mistake, but he probably still cares for you; and also, just give the new school thing time. I've moved around a lot and have been the 'new kid' a few times, so it would add a lot of frustration. You'll meet new best friends, and especially when you've already grown more (when you become best friends during 1st grade, the two of you would split into two different paths since you're not so alike as you were in 1st grade, but if you meet new friends now, it'll last much longer.)<br>  <br>  Good luck, you can make it through :)!|`|nsgeWjspaa	i can understand how that can make you feel hearing what your father said is there anyway you could live with your mother ? you are so young i feel so sorry for you one day your father will have regrets that will haunt him at night what ever you do do not harm your self that will not fix anything if you ever need a friend to talk to you can email me sorry for the way that jerk treats you you deserve so much more hang in there and keep your head up|`|MkRDYwUtaa	Well, even though your dad might think you are a mistake, God didn't.

AA12208063	Just eat a sensible amount every day.  When food controls you it is a problem. Food is for our survival and shouldn't be something that controls us.  I think talking to a professional can help and perhaps a dietitian.  Eat at least 1200 calories a day and don't "save" all those calories for one meal - spread it out over at least three meals.|`|OlXhEVNEaa	heheheheh.....force yourself to stop eating and feel the pain....get used to a smaller amount of eating...and remember no pain no gain....im talking about when your hungry and don't know what to eat do just eat something because its there....just find something else better to do like draw...or play the ps2 or something else to get your mind off eating stuff...e-mail me for more advice....|`|5LyLuQRFaa	Don't listen to media corporation's hypnotising flare over humanity...it's great to be a healthy weight but don't feel pushed by society to be skinny.

Also, if you do not seek help it will likely consume you, that and eating disorders often cause other diseases, drug habits, and death. Get some help, please.<br>  <br>  <br>  check out www.homefreehomecontest.com|`|kayPYreQaa	I personally think you have an Image problem and should consult a Doctor or Therapist. Society puts too much pressure on being skinny. You don't have to be Skinny to be happy and healthy. You can as any Doctor or Personal Trainer There are skinny "fat" unhealthy people too. If you want to keep your weight down/ loose weight you need to reduce your caloric intake. I think you should make sure you eat a good heart healthy breakfast, a reasonable lunch and light dinner. I wouldn't be surprised if you end up gaining weight the weigh you are going. When you only eat once a day you Body thinks OMG when am i going to eat again I need to store some for later so anything you eat could en up turning to fat. So keep you metabolism going by eating small meals/snacks during the day. Try to to eat any carbs after 3pm and try not to eat anything past 7pm because after 7 most people are less active and what you eat will not get burned off. Also make use you exercise, Best time to exercise is in the morning to set the day off right and eat do not eat before you exercise because you will just feel fat and bloated and not want to work as hard, and after its important to eat something light and drink lots of water.|`|3LqDcv1oaa	I know this is stupid typical answer but really, you should try planing out 3 square meals a day, that are healthy and filling. Then try to exercise 3 times a week. And remember that your beautiful no matter what size you are. Also maybe you could join a gym and get to know some similar people to help you keep on track.|`|9xTMRkKWaa	Here are some mental symptoms of anorexia:<br>  <br>  Distortion of body image or excessive importance placed on body composition or shape (you do this).<br>  Denial of seriousness of low weight (you do this).<br>  Intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, even if the person is considered underweight (you do this).<br>  Ritualistic eating (including cutting food into a planned number of bites) (you do this).<br>  <br>  You should get counseling to deal with your feelings regarding food.  It is not healthy to worry so much about your food intake or lack of it.  It is important at this point (since you have now acknowledged your problem) to seek help from someone familiar with eating disorders.  You may be able to talk to your counselor at school to find someone who can help you.  You can also talk to your parents (they have noticed, believe me) or if you are a college student you will have resources at student health.  Good Luck!

Don't lift everyday because you wont be building muscles, you need to let your muscles rests so they grow.|`|1hApuJTHaa	"Most bodybuilders will tell you "protein, protein, protein. . . " Actually, it takes more energy to burn protein than carbs. You may have a harder time if you increase your protein too much. The basics: eat every 3 hours if possible. Increase your complex carbs. Think of your meals as a 2/3 carb 1/3 protein portion. Eat right before you go to bed. Otherwise, you are starving your body for 7 - 8 hours. Do not skip meals.<br>  <br>  Take a good multi-vitamin. If you are into supplements, I recommend creatine on 6 week cycles with a 10-14 day break between each cycle. It is not necessary to spend hundreds of dollars on supplements each month. Drink 12 ounces of water with meals. Second, dedicate yourself to a good strength conditioning program. Combination free weights and machines. Concentrate on power exercises (ie: squats, bench presses, etc). Work out 4-6 days a week for 1 hour at a time. Before working out, stretch and do about 10 min of cardio (bike, treadmill, jump rope, etc). Try to minimize your cardio because you will burn calories and increase metabolism like crazy. Maybe, only do 30 minutes of cardio,1 day a week, in addition to your 10 minute warm ups before lifting."<br>  <br>  Not by me, copied and pasted from the site below.

a50adc767b2a79758a91103f0f987b08aa	Why the recent surge in popularity? Many sauna enthusiasts and doctors have heralded the abundance of health benefits of saunas. Perhaps the most obvious and immediate advantage is the sense of calm that comes with prolonged exposure to therapeutic heat. In today's fast-paced, hectic lifestyles, unprecedented levels of stress have the potential to weaken our immune systems, making us more vulnerable to illnesses and disease. Regular sauna sessions can help to reduce these high stress levels, contributing to an overall enhanced sense of well-being and a greater resistance to sickness. Sweating also helps the body to release heat, regulating our core temperature.|`|AA11476749	Saunas help eliminate toxins from your body, as well as relaxing after a workout.  While some minor "weight loss" occurs, it is water weight and will come back after drinking your first beverage following it.

OIBIqDGtaa	Wow! I cant believe how similar your story is to mine. In 7th grade i was hella skinny too. i never weighed over 100 lbs until the summer going into 10th. I now weigh around 127 and im only 5'. I did start feeling depressed at first but now im somewhat at ease. Now i just not ignore it but try not to think about it. ive been getting active more to lose the weight. being active has helped boost my energy and its a good way to get rid of depression. Its also helped for me to be a healty skinny with muscle and tone. Instead of like before i was just kinda skin and bones which is not attractive i realize.|`|HhKOOX8zaa	you are perfect right now.<br>  you should talk to a good friend bout this.|`|Ba5PVgHMaa	125lbs, is NOT fat. Dont go back to being anorexic, its really not healthy at all, it does so much more damage than you know. If you like the dicipline, join a sport, or find something else like this that you can put that energy into. You are way too young to be worrying yourself so much. I have a natural big bone sturcture, but i've learned to accept myself and just be happy in my own skin, and thats what you need to try and do.|`|fVfusXeSaa	Your weight is fine, healthy.  I'm 5'7 and 130 lbs, and considered pretty skinny among my friends (and were not the kind of people that like fat people 50% of my friends have battled eating disorders)  <br>  To fill the empty feeling, find something else that makes you happy.  A lot of anorexics have an addictive mind, which means that they always want something that gives them a feeling of success.  But don't turn to smoking or drugs or alcohol or sex.  Take up an instrument or decided to get really good grades or decided to have an abundant amount of friends.  Find someone to talk to about anorexia who won't judge you (i've got mine).  <br>  About cloths: go shopping! this is such a good opportunity! buy empire waisted cloths if you want to hide a belly.|`|fhoFrk9Yaa	Honestly, I have felt the same way. My freshman year of high school, in fact, is when I felt like that. I hardly ate. And I didn't weigh much. Now I weigh almost 110 pounds, and I feel like I'm a little fat, but I know I'm not. I'm sure you are not fat. Look it up. Look up your BMI (Body Mass Index) and that will tell you if you are at a healthy weight or not. :)<br>  If you really do like the discipline, join a sport, or go to the gym and walk a little bit every day. Swim. Exercise. Eat and maintain a healthy diet.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  If it doesn't, I'd go and see a therapist. I'm not a professional, so I can't tell you why you are thinking about that, or like that, but a therapist can. They can also help you find ways to stop thinking like that, or at least try to help. <br>  Please don't starve yourself. You may see it as discipline, but your friends and family see it as suicide and self-inflicted pain. ):|`|7swefA6Paa	try putting that discipline into excercise instead, it may not sound fun, but once you start going to the gym it is completely addicting.  you will love seeing muscle, or starting to see abs, etc|`|tq1eQwRZaa	I have an ED too...not quite anorexia, cuz i eat 1000 calories per day but im scared to death to gain weight. Im technically underweight at 5'1 and 85 lbs. Ive been the same weight since i started high school (im a junior now) and before that i was tinier and shorter. Every time i eat something i "shouldn't" have i feel extremely guilty. I only allow myself safe foods and i dont eat stuff i used to love a year ago, like chocolate and cookies and ice cream. Ive been small my entire life, so i dont know why i always feel so fat. I measure my waist and my thighs at least twice a day, to make sure they havent gotten any bigger. Im constantly cold and my ribs and hipbones are showing. Its pathetic.

AG9msdUDaa	I believe that digestive rate is somewhat independent of metabolism, but is definitely influenced by metabolism. The more food you eat, the more food you need to processes, so it may seem as though digestion is 'faster' if you eat more, but the truth is, you just have more food going in and pushing older food through the intestinal tract. And it also depends on what you eat:<br>  <br>  Solid versus liquid - liquids are emptied from the stomach more quickly than solids.<br>  <br>  Fat content of the food - fat slows the digestive process and delays the availability of any Calories to the muscles.<br>  <br>  Sugar concentration - especially in liquids, a sugar content of more than 10% will slow stomach emptying. (The use of complex carbohydrates, will offset this to some degree and offers an alternative strategy to maximize Caloric intake.)<br>  <br>  and what you do:<br>  <br>  Physical activity  - the mechanical activity of digestion is slowed by any vigorous activity. In running the mechanical stimulation of abdominal contents from the sport itself slows digestive tract functioning.<br>  <br>  And it can also be influenced by the type and amount of probiotics in the intestines because some species are better energy extractors. This means that two people eating the same diet can be different weights.

Obtain a copy of your medical records from the base where the surgery was perfomed.  Have any proof that there was no further injury after your discharge.  Once you have been evaluated, you may be able to claim disability.  The VA will help you fill out and file the necessary forms.

If your body has already adapted, it means it doesn't need to change.  <br>  <br>  Lift heavy weights, control what you eat, and do intense cardio.  Also, get proper sleep.  That's what will create change.<br>  <br>  Also, make best friends with this site: <a href="http://exrx.net/" rel="nofollow">http://exrx.net/</a><br>  <br>  Edit: "to get cut do less weight, more reps with no rest and cardio."<br>  <br>  BULL.  Need proof?  <br>  <a href="http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/Myths.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exrx.net/WeightTraining/Myths...</a><br>  <br>  Specifically, look at the "High Repetitions Burn More Fat Myth"<br>  <br>  "Typically a set's duration is 20 to 30 seconds. For the average fit person, it requires 20 to 30 minutes of continuous aerobic activity with large muscle groups (e.g. Gluteus Maximus and Quadriceps) to burn even 50% fat; fat requires oxygen to burn. Performing a few extra repetitions on a weight training exercise is not significant enough to burn extra fat and may in effect burn less fat. If intensity is compromised, less fat may be burned when light weight is used with high repetitions. The burning sensation associated with high repetition training seems to be the primary deterrent for achieving higher intensities.<br>  <br>  Higher volume weight training (i.e. 3 sets versus 1 set of each exercise) with short rest periods of approximately 1 minutes can stimulate a greater acute growth hormone release (Kraemer 1991, 1993; Mulligan 1996). Growth hormone is lipolytic in adults. It is hypothesized that maximal effort is necessary for optimizing exercise induced secretion of growth hormone. Growth hormone release is related to the magnitude of exertion (Pyka 1992) and is attenuated with greater lactic acidosis"|`|uxctidZkaa	to get cut do less weight, more reps with no rest and cardio. only eat when youre hungry and some carbs right b4 u lift. none of that 6-8 meals a day anymore. stop drinking alcohol and soda pop if you do already.
QODJNf1oaa	aww, thats really nice of you to do that for her. The best way to do it is by combining exersize with less calorie intake. Since she wants to lose weight, she probably feels bad about herself right now and eating bad is making her feel better about herself. If you really want to help her, then whenever she feels like she wants to eat bad you have to say to her, "just think how good you will feel in a few months." or suggest going for a walk, or doing something that involves activity (wii fit). The type of foods you can eat is all fruits and vegetables, low carbs (like low fat pasta, whole wheat bread) penut butter, yoghurt (great for losing weight), lots of salad, fish, milk, eggs...and drink lots of water because it fills you up and makes you not want to eat the bad foods that you normally would. I think that tea is okay with honey, but she should probably stay away from anything that is sweet will probably make her want to start eating bad again.|`|nDzenpkwaa	First the tea question.  Tea is great for you.  Antioxidants will help your body stay healthy and away from things like cancer.  It depends on how much honey you put in there. A little won't hurt but if you drown it, you are ruining your attempt to stay fit and healthy.  The best food, while not tasting great, are the foods high in fiber.  Stay away from fatty foods high in calories.  <br>  <br>  Grilled Chicken - no bbq sauce, use salt and pepper for seasoning<br>  Salads - radish, cucumbers, celery, Spinach<br>  steamed veggies - add a little salt for flavor<br>  and for your fiber, drink coffee in the morning add only milk if you don't like it too heavy. At night make yourself a Metamucil shake before bed.  The orange or pink lemonade are pretty good.  You'll have more frequent bowel movements and this will keep you fit and healthy.  <br>  You should also exercise...|`|jsxphZJEaa	First of all you need to reduce the sugar intake in your diet, that is the most important and start adding approx 8 -10 glasses of water per day. Next lose the junk food, chips, etc. also, exclude diet drinks and caffeine.<br>  Replace fast food and processed foods with fruits, veggies, and proteins. Some grains and carbs are fine too. Then increase your movement, by walking or lite exercise to start.  You will see a huge difference in short period of time|`|wKbRwH3haa	I strongly feel that pills (herbal especially) are not the answer.  The answer is fruit and vegetables, fish and meat without skin or coatings on it.  Eat all meals in moderation, don't eat more than you need to satisfy your hunger.  Anything fried in oil/ butters, should be avoided, using cooking techniques like steaming, grilling, boiling and roasting.  Nuts and seeds are also good in small potions. <br>  <br>  Honey is a good natural sweetener, high in sugars, but apparently good for weight loss.  Honey has lots of health benefits.  <br>  <br>  I recently got into some bad eating habits, ive gained 10lbs since christmas by eating whatever I wanted (which is great until your jeans don't fit anymore!) and am trying to be as healthy as possible, I like stir frys at the moment, lots of veg, fried in a tiny bit of hot oil, with fish or chicken.  Good luck :)|`|HVuIZP7Raa	Well you need to swich to whole grain bread to curve hungar and eat small snacks throughout the day like almonds,low fat yogurt, and fresh fruit to keep you satisfied. Lifting weights will allow you to burn the most calories and also always eat a protein source for breakfast because studies show that people who do eat protein like a protein bar or egg whites burn up to 60% mor calories throughout the day. My favorite snack that I eat all the time is sugar free jello with light cool whip (fat free and only 20 calories) Good Luck!|`|1oEhpwGvaa	broccoli!!!<br>  green beans<br>  cucumbers<br>  apple slices<br>  cantelope<br>  cottage cheese<br>  Kashi<br>  drink green tea<br>  <br>  also tell your girlfriend to try the special K challenge|`|RcqBodwVaa	you must avoid junk foods like burger, pizza and all<br>  and you should include more vegetables and fruits in your diet; besides a healthy diet a bit or working out could help a lot as well|`|wGTisY1aaa	Try these good nutrition meals.

The thing is if you don't do anything about it not only will it hurt you but your parents will find out any way via your behaviour with the condition.<br>  <br>  Your parents don't NEED to know why your going to the doctor and you don't NEED to tell them. Put yourself first as this is best for you and those effected by any possible mental illness you may have.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best and I believe you have the strengh and will to what is best.|`|P72xATuDaa	I would take some online tests first. if they say yes. the go to a councilor or doctor or whom ever you choose.

I don't remember the exact name of them, but just go where the eye, ear, and nose care stuff is in the store and look around and you should find them pretty easily.  They're kind of expensive (the ones I got were about $10).  And they may not work right away, it might take a couple times.  But they eventually worked for me...but everyone's body is different.<br>  <br>  Yeah, don't plug your nose and blow...that will probably make it worse and it could really damage your ear if you blow too hard.|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Go to a health food store or website and try the candle (I'm not sure the proper name, but ask around an employee will know what you are talking about). It sounds strange but works great. Basically you put it in your ear and burn one end, it creates suction which gets all that nasty stuff out of your ear. You will need a buddy. Good luck!|`|ENeVo6bkaa	You will have to let it just happen on it's own. That happened to me too and I tried everything, but nothing worked. It will pop on it's own :) Don't force it because you might end up really hurting your ear.|`|AA10335589	yawning is the best or...............go to the doctor because trust me bug go in the ears, it has happen to my mom and my mother in law.........so if it's something serious...........go to the doctor!|`|Zdh6pVqMaa	I had this same problem about a year ago after flying with a sinus infection. I went to the doctor and was given some antibiotics, but unfortunately nothing helped....they just eventually unplugged themselves. I would suggest not plugging your nose and blowing-that could do damage to your ears. Since I don't know how you ears became clogged it's a little difficult to diagnose, but I would say that if you can't tell that they are getting better in a week, or if they are getting worse or hurting to go see a doctor before there is any serious permanent hearing lose.|`|Bsimt0Dgaa	YES!!<br>  <br>  This just happened to me.  It has happened to me more than once.  There is a build-up of wax deep in your ear canal, and it is most likely pressing up against your eardrum.  You need to go to a doctors office and have him/her flush out the wax.  If you use a q-tip to try and dig it out, you will only make it worse (trust me I know).<br>  <br>  My doctor gave me some advise if this ever happens again.....<br>  <br>  Put a couple of drops of olive oil in your ears.  Then use a cotton ball to plug your ear up.  The olive oil will soften and loosen up the waxy build-up.  Do this at night before you go to bed.  Then in the morning, stand with your head tilted in the shower to flush out the olive oil.  This may take a few days before you get any results.  If you want immediate results, go get your ears flushed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YzQ8VzI6aa	It should usually go away within a day or two. If it persist, you should go see a doctor. Inner ear is very delicate, and if it continue, it may cause damage.<br>  <br>  some methods i use<br>  1.Take a warm shower then lie down with your head slightly lower than you body. It should be gone by 5-10min<br>  2.If you are on a enclosed space, try going out for a walk.

9EVcTnUWaa	I would make a doctor's appointment and talk to them about it. Get a referral from then and than go see whom ever they refer you to.  Since you're 18 you don't have to get your parents permission to go to the doctor. IF you want ask your mother to go with you to a session with the therapist so that they can explain the realities of depression to your mother. even if she can't totally accept it she'll be less likely to ask you for things you can't give her right now.  Having a professional talk to your mother would be the easiest way to do it.  IF you want have your mother go with you to the doctor when you ask for the referral. Than have your doctor explain things to your mom, since it's a professional she's more likely to at least listen.  That might open a dialogue with her and that's a good thing.|`|g09x06Zpaa	Well, this is tough because of what she already believes. She might even think that your just saying you have depression because your friends have it. (Part of a trend).<br>  <br>  Ask her to go to the doctor with you (for something else that isn't depression) and then tell the doctor about the results. She's less likely to be confrontational about it when the trusted family doctor says you have it and he suggests medication or therapy. <br>  <br>  You're actually 1/4th of the way to getting better if you're willing to accept you have it. But you need a support base, and that's where medication (to get you stable) and therapy (to get you motivated) come into play. You need all three things to actually get better. <br>  <br>  Your mom is partially right; you need to be self motivated enough to get better. But the pills really help stabilize you to the point that you can get better. <br>  <br>  Also, you should include how old you are in this topic, =]

gERaZGZeaa	Yes, eggs are good for you.  Anybody who tells you otherwise is uneducated and incorrect, and just repeated what they hear on the internet from other uneducated and incorrect people.<br>  <br>  All vitamins and minerals, all the good Omega-3 fats, and about half the protein of eggs are found in the yolks.  <br>  <br>  Also, the amount of cholesterol in food that you ingest doesn't really have an impact on the cholesterol level of your body.|`|ZY2GT7edaa	eat the egg whites<br>  egg yolks are where the cholesterol comes from<br>  eggs are good for you other than that|`|grjDkG00aa	yes you can! you are 19 years old and active and basically the amount of daily protein you need is 36g! that's daily...2 eggs amounts to only 13g of protein. Eggs are not as bad as you think. Not only do eggs have the most perfect protein component but they contain lecithin, which aids in fat assimilation, and most important, they raise the HDL levels,(the good cholesterol) <br>  It might interest you to know that 1g of protein=4 calories & 1g of carbohydrates = 4 calories. In other words, they have the same calorie count. If you are concerned with your physical well-being, eat a balanced diet. Some people assume that by eating more protein the thinner and more muscles will ensue. Protein doesn't burn-up fat!<br>  And, believe it or not, one beef taco or a slice of pizza will give you more protein than 2 eggs or 4 slices of bacon, or even a whole cup of milk.

The twitch/tic thing sounds like that might be a part of it, but the unresponsiveness could just be his personality. <br>  <br>  I think what's important is to ask yourself: do you need to know, why is it important, and will knowing if he does/doesn't have it change your relationship? <br>  <br>  Sometimes you can just leave these things be :) Or you could talk to him directly, if you feel he'll give you a good answer or insight.|`|S4X8zOUoaa	Well the description you're giving isn't exactly what you'd base a diagnosis on.<br>  <br>  It's possible. But it really doesn't have to be. And either way, what name you give it won't make a difference, because it is not something that can be cured or changed.
211fb3132ed73b4619f11d053f93f3e3aa	It could be a rotator cuff or collar bone injury.  Did you injure it recently?  Do you have any problems with your neck?  Do you sleep in a weird position?  Have you ever dislocated your shoulder?  <br>  <br>  I know... that's a lot of questions - lol!!  But answer them if you can.  I can check back.  <br>  <br>  Immediately, I can recommend that you take Advil and get a parent or friend to massage it.  Try some heat or ice - whichever makes it feel better.  Do this for 20 min on and 20 min off.  Do that for about an hour, or an hour and a half.  Then use the heat or ice as you like, but don't use it for extended periods of time.<br>  <br>  Call an orthopedic doctor to schedule an appointment.  Sometimes they are booked up and its hard to get an appointment right way, but call to get an appointment as soon as you can.  If you can't get in soon enough, call your primary doctor.  If the pain keeps getting worse, as your parents if they can take you to the emergency department for x-rays to be done immediately.  Also, while you are there and they are doing the x-rays, the doctor will check your range of motion and give you the proper medication.  They will also decide if you need to rest your arm - put it in a sling - or keep it moving.  This is also important.<br>  <br>  Check out the link below.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|MtO5BXOBaa	could it be from carrying a heavy backpack/book bag?|`|1LaWDd7Eaa	It could be the position of sleeping or it could be the posture you're sitting or kneeling, crouching, for e.g when you're watching tv or reading. <br>  <br>  <br>  In the Mornings, afternoon evenings /  night. exercise the arms and Shoulders,  circling back,  forward & sideways to prevent future injuries and pain.

Any constant over head movement...?<br>  <br>  I've been a whole swimmer my whole life & actually just had surgery two weeks ago on my shoulder. Apparently I tore my labrum- which is like a meniscus of your shoulder-- about three years ago and it's just been tearing since. I never would have guessed the seriousness of it until part of it showed up on an MRI. I'm not going to lie, it hurt a lot over the years, a constant pinching every time my arm was in an awkward position or anything over my head. (swimming, for example, hurt, but because i'm stupid... I ignored it) You're smart for recognizing this. It got to the point where it would hurt to just brush my hair in the morning.--- that is when I realized it might be a problem. lol - It would hurt a lot when I would sleep too, probably because I would rest my head on my shoulder.<br>  <br>  Just for comparison--- the popping you hear in your shoulder seems similar to mine. It would crack and pop and make these weird scratchy noises whenever i would move it or raise my hand to answer a question in class, etc. <br>  <br>  If you have any reasons to have a shoulder injury from overuse, etc , I suggest you go get it looked out before it gets worse. The biggest problem they found with mine was that I was growing as it was tearing so parts of my shoulder grew over it causing it to be even more messed up.<br>  <br>  If you have a trainer at your school I would go see what they think, if not hit up the physical therapist's office, or an orthopedic surgen.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|ARCF5U82aa	Sounds like masturbationitis.|`|wtr0aDpBaa	Go to the doctors|`|xMnN99T8aa	Rotator cuff injury.

dpgXzMenaa	One simple and cheap way to help with cramps (it's also the quickest, and the most convenient and natural... but you may find it difficult to talk about with your kid) is having an orgasm by masturbating.   It doesn't work for *all* women, but it does help many... and for some, it can get rid of cramps entirely for a while.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.epigee.org/menstruation/sex.h...</a><br>  <br>  "... an orgasm can cause your uterus to contract, enabling it to use up excess prostaglandins in the process. Prostagladins are hormones produced by your uterine lining. They help to stimulate contractions that move menstrual blood out of the uterus, and are also responsible for those cramps that occur throughout your period."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kadir-buxton.com/page8.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.kadir-buxton.com/page8.htm</a><br>  <br>  "Primary Menstrual Cramps can be a debilitating problem for some 10% of women. Conventional treatment can even be as drastic as exploratory surgery whilst looking for a cure. A less intrusive solution is available. Orgasm from masturbation has been found to relieve the painful symptoms of menstrual cramps. Whilst it is not always convenient to masturbate for the necessary five minutes until the pain subsides, hands free masturbation is still possible. In order to do this one simply has to clench and then relax the vagina repeatedly for five minutes. With this method no one need know of the discomfort being suffered, and the pain soon goes.

Is she on birth control to help make the symptoms subside? They out me on the pill for this reason and it did help but my body didn't like the pill for other reasons (but everyone is different). Once you see a doctor, they might be able to help. Unfortunately, this might be how it is for her. Staying home with a hot pad on her stomach might help. Using pads and trying to get some exercise helps. Good luck!|`|7xc8jgLXaa	i recommend Ibuprofen (Advil) and ThermaCare Heat Wraps.<br>  <br>  ThermaCare makes heat wraps specifically for Menstrual cramps but I've also used the neck and shoulder ones for cramps and they work pretty much the same way (the menstrual ones are just smaller).

A lot of girls get on it if they have bad cramps.|`|VhHVjMe8aa	My oldest had this problem and she had a tipped uterus, her Dr. put her on the pill and that helped.|`|mrysAOpGaa	midol may help briefly, or advil.  She needs medical attention though because sometimes severe pain with a period could possibly mean other things such as cervical cancer, cysts on the ovaries which could lead to bursting and causes more pain, she may have a problem to where she may need a hysterectomy ( these are all possible reasons, i know from experience) they may want to put her on birth control and a medicine called naproxen ( thats what i was on because i had the same pain problems ) she may not have any of these, but there is a reason for the severe pain and it needs attention.  Also, i dont know what her being gorgeous and what her physical stats have anything to do with her menstraul issues but whatever.  Get her help if you can its very crucial and benificial to her health.|`|TbYQyxM0aa	Naproxen Sodium will knock ANY menstrual cramp pain out! You can get a presciption or over the counter. But, I urge you to take her to the doctor's because a normal menstrual cycle should not cause cramps with such severe pain. She can have an underlying problems and a HUGE doctor's bill may be worth it. All states have some form of Charity Care, which will help you with medical bills if you prove financial difficulties.|`|j3rKUI3eaa	I had this exact same issue when i was the same age. <br>  <br>  I don't like taking pain medication too othen so the first thing my doctor suggested was going on the contraceptive pill, which eased it a great deal. The I added to this cutting out all caffeine for a few days before and during that time of the month, drinking loads of water, and making an effort to do some gentle exercise, like a little walk around or soemthing. Also some sort of wheat bag or hot water bottle for both the lower back and tummy is really soothing too.|`|AUOp1j5Saa	Naproxen is the best you can do without a diagnosis of a more severe underlying problem.<br>  Midol is alright for some but naproxen is better in general. If the pains are still so severe that she cannot go to school then you can start talking about alternatives like acupuncture or even mild opiates (Tylenol with codine) with her OBGYN.|`|ZCAnfK3Taa	bananas help and a hot water bottle or a hot bath or some light exercises can help cramps|`|zcZGRPc2aa	i agree with the naproxen answer it is like the best thing. wish it didnt have to be prescribed though|`|crgI7ZR5aa	ahhh ur such a good father i wish my dad cared about me...midol or just show her this website it helped me it has so many ideas on how to make her feel better...good luck<br>  <br>  being girl.com|`|yNCN1L64aa	Heating pad and IB Profin/Motrin is the best for me.  Her being in that much pain could mean something like endometriosis (where the type of tissue that lines the inside of the uterus grows on the outside).  If you have a planned parenthood close to you, have her go there for a yearly exam and talk to the dr about her severe cramps.  Seeing as you have no insurance, and she is young, they should cover the costs of the exam, or at the very least it will be cheaper.  Sometimes as you get older they will ease up.  But it's always good to have those things checked out at least every year.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|plFzUai2aa	Have you taken her to the doctor. I have a friend like that and she was diagnosed w/ PMDD. An extreme form of PMS. In other words: intensified symptoms of the symptoms we already experience. If over the counter medicine doesn't help w/ pain, some prescribed medicine like Naproxen or Motrin will help w/ pain. However for the moods and hormonal part birth control may be a good option. I had to use this to regulate my menstrual cycle. However you did mention she was a teenager so you may not want to do this. <br>  <br>  I am also a fan of Vitamins. I started taking a B-Complex multi-vitamin on a daily basis and this was extremely helpful in regulating moods and helping w/ cramps.<br>  <br>  Best bet, doctor/clinic visit. Since there is not a lot of money try looking into a planned parenthood/family planning sort of office. They should at least give you a start. Hope this helps.|`|cfd8bb6be76d4a0d0ff19515a2b85440aa	Midol will work but if she is having severe pain she needs a bit more. It is quite common. Many girls her age are put on birth control to help. The meds help regulate her and ease the pain. She's at the age that she needs to be getting checked out anyways. A lot of times if you go to the gyno they have free samples but you can always go to the local health dept they factor the med payments on your pay check.|`|g10uz8nAaa	you can take her to planned parent hood...i believe they can give her birth control for free...now dont think im saying for sexual becuase im not...when i was 15 my doctor put me on birth control because my menstrual cramps were so bad i was vomiting an missing school...for 5 days straight<br>  <br>  the birth control can help with her menstrual cramps alot...if that dosent work...the day before she starts her period then she need to start take motrin or midol...so by the time her period comes she wont cramp as bad

xc8bnpCvaa	nope. That is just like someone at work telling you they are taking the latest greatest whatever and you decide to go buy it. <br>  They don't write you a prescription for it etc... they just recommend the product. Basically all they are doing is endorsing a product. If someone chooses to go buy it that is up to them, the recommender is not getting paid right? He/she isn't going and buying this stuff and RE-selling it are they?  <br>  If no, I don't see where they have done anything wrong other than tell someone they need medicine for their spirit....

XSu3dedGaa	You need medical attention.<br>  <br>  Nosebleeds follow a 10 minute on 10 minute off rule.<br>  <br>  After 10 minutes of pinching your nose, release the pressure, if you haven't stopped bleeding, reapply for up a further 2 periods of 10 minutes. If you still haven't stopped bleeding you need to see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Because this is impacting on your life as a whole, you need to see a doctor, and tell them everything you've told us. Only go to A&E if the nose-bleeds don't follow the 10 minute rule.<br>  <br>  Nobody here can give you the correct diagnosis, we can't see you, we can't scan your heads, we can't help, we can only make educated guesses, these won't help you. Most people on Y!A have no medical training at all, and those who do are on the wrong side of the computer to help you.

It'll problably feel better in a little better naturaly unless its something more serious like the flue or something.  Just rest, drink plenty of liquids, stuff like gatorade if you have it to hydrate you incase you throw up.  <br>  But also try an over the counter stomach medicine.  Ask the pharmasist at a drug store what they reccomend.  <br>  Hope you feel better.

p27jMTFuaa	I would make sure you take AP chemistry and biology.  This will give you a leg up when you start college.  You have to take so much chemistry and biology that its worth it to be able to get right into the real stuff and skip the intro stuff.  Skip the AP physics as it won't save you much time in college as you will have to take the same two classes either way.  I would try to take calculus while still in HS as it will give you a leg up with your math in college.  I wouldn't worry as much about AP classes for the humanities.  You might want to take those in college as filler courses anyway.  Taking a full load of only pre-med courses can be terrible.  Its nice to take some gen-ed with those tough science ones.  So concentrate on the science and math.  <br>  <br>  Also remember that med-schools look at the whole person and not just the academics.  So don't neglect the other parts of yourself.  Make sure you have fun.|`|T4uZeVXjaa	You will need to get a BSc, then an MD, then do an ophthamology residency.  <br>  <br>  So for high school you only need to worry about what courses will get you into a BSc program.  Check with your guidance counselor about the requirements for colleges in your area, but likely you will need to concentrate on math and science.
cilYUWgtaa	I believe we can (sort of) choose when we die. I worked in a nursing home as a nurse's assistant for a time. There was a woman who was clinging to life (or so it seemed) and had been for days. I went into her room on first rounds (I was a night aide) and noticing the religious items in the room, assumed she was of the Christian faith. I said to her in a quiet voice "It's ok, Jesus loves you", and left the room. I checked back on a hunch 20 minutes later, and she had passed. There were many other examples of when a spouse died, the survivor died days later, as if they were hanging on to life to make sure they were cared for, and once they passed, it was "ok" to die.

They help at first but once your body gets use to it, it won't have any affect on your body anymore. 15 is too young to be taking diet pills.

1accebcfa5f7af07e3721c9f3d2645cbaa	You don't have to move slow. And peeing or pooping has nothing to do with where the tampon is. You don't have to take it out to do that. Your activity doesn't need to be altered because of it. Don't leave one in more than 6 hours. You probably will have to change it before than anyway. It isn't a good idea to sleep with it in. You should use a pad at night. Toxic shock problems can occur if you do.(rare) Good luck!|`|mMGDavCDaa	lol just go pee when you haveto go!!! and as for forgetting don worry you wont if you can't stop thinking about it!!!! trust me you will no when its time to take it out and whn you do angle it and slowlypull, it could tke a while but normally it just slips out|`|IkHTD61Gaa	lol chill.you can do anything and every thing that you would normally do with a tampon in. don't worry about moving slow, i ran trak at my school with one in. and the trick is when you pee is to put your hand around your backand hold the strind back towards your bum to avoid peeing in it, but you don't have to take it out every time your pee, i don't. just relaxand think about how much more comfortable you are without a pad.|`|fQch3BkEaa	dont worry about it just think of it as not being there like an ear ring if you cant put up with it go back to wearing pads and stuff

DPegPYRPaa	If you have a cracked rib it is basically pointless to go to a doctor unless you want them to prescribe something for pain. They can't cast it and they can't do anything for it. <br>  <br>  Are you having sharp pain while breating deep? That is how I know. It hurt so bad!<br>  <br>  I got one 4wheeling and went in and they told me exactly that. They could only give me something for the pain. the only thing you can do is wait it out, take it easy, and give it time to heal.<br>  <br>  And the poster above does not know what he is talking about...|`|inWCSvM8aa	I doubt you have a cracked rib... otherwise, you would already be seeking help at a hospital from the pain and not posting on the Internet.|`|Ff8j6btEaa	my brother ust roke two ribs and he said he hit the ground o hard  he didnt feel anything after a minute, all the docter could do is take this cloth and rap it around is back, and he took tylonal, and he just cant do active sports. so if you go to the doctor all they will do is take an xray and tell you if you cracked it or not, maybe you should wait a few days b4 you go, and just be layed back, just watch some tv or something if it still really hurts go check it out at the doctor.<br>  <br>  hope this helps!!!
fbGv4iZ1aa	Yes that was a very normal response for your body to have.  Good for you in not trying again.  Nicotine is the most addictive drug in the US and many other countries, and the hardest to stop using.  <br>  <br>    If you were a smoker and had not had a cigarette for several days your body would have done the same things, smokers don't smoke for that light headed feeling, that feeling is due to the nicotine entering the blood stream and the carsongenics that enter the lungs.  It's very temporary side effect to smoking.  Keep up the good work in not wanting to smoke,  Wish I had.<br>  <br>  Ashtray Mouth in Oregon|`|yNi1adRqaa	I hope that your curiosity has been satisfied. Smoking is like getting poked in the arm over and over with a fork. Sooner or later the fork and the cigarette are going to cause some severe damage. The lightheadedness that you experienced is the restriction of the blood vessels in your brain caused by the many chemicals in the cigarette. If you smoke long enough you will stop noticing that. But please pay attention to it now, it is your body warning you that smoking is not a good thing. We know that smoking causes cancer! I don't smoke, but I do have cancer - I wouldn't wish this on anybody. Please do everything you can to avoid cancer.|`|Ebffvr2jaa	I have been a smoker since I was 14 and I am currently 42. I never planned on getting addicted or any thing like that. However I can tell you if you play with them they will get you and trust me it is not an easy habit to break. I am working on that now and it sucks AZZ!  That feeling they give you should be proof they are not healthy!  PLEASE DONT SMOKE EVER AGAIN!!|`|ijXOMlIsaa	yes thats normal.

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	A hacksaw blade works pretty well, but it's very slow because you can't hold the blade at an optimal angle in order to avoid cutting yourself.|`|hoDin3UYaa	Removing it yourself is not a good idea at all. Removing it yourself could possibly re-injure your arm or worse. I suggest going back to your doctor.

eekwpTMRaa	Toast w/natural pb<br>  fruit like apple for jumpstart energy<br>  milk or juice (4 oz)<br>  <br>  Snack: (2 hours later)  fruit like banana and kashi granola bar or anything with fiber and carbs<br>  <br>  Lunch: sandwhich with actual veggies on it and meat and cheese. or have the veggies on the side. And small dessert:) as a treat. crackers and or more protein like hard boiled egg. <br>  <br>  Snack: bowl of cereal :) veggies  or salad. hard boiled egg now rather than lunch or both<br>  <br>  Dinner: baked meat, not red meat. Or a wrap. Avacado and veggies and maybe more fruit :)  Soup to fill you up before dinner starts<br>  <br>  This is my meal many days and i love it. Bfast is small b/c if you really have a full meal then you'll be sleepy and tired. i mean really what do you need the energy for? its not liek your running 10+ miles, this will give you brain energy and help you start your day off good. <br>  The snacks arent that great but i really dont snack too much and its not that great. you can swap lunch and dinner all the time and swap carbs and veggies with other varieties. The soup is a great trick, this is similar to what i had in europe and its great for a day. lunch and dinner should be big, but lunch the biggest since its holding you over if you dont snack between l&d.

Check out: <a href="http://www.weightlossmiraclesystem.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightlossmiraclesystem.com</a><br>  <br>  I recommend it because it's an all-natural and permanent solution and was rated #1.|`|clTSDRy1aa	Actually, you don't need to diet per se if you want to lose weight, the one thing which definitely showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it has been reported in Fox News and USA Today. I worked off 25 pounds, it definitely does produce success!
W2z5dCrmaa	It depends on how often, good eating, and each of us is different on the outside, like we are all different inside.<br>  <br>  Some Dudes have large seminal vesicles and a bigger prostrate gland, so they come up with a huge load. Male porn stars are picked for many reasons when they audition, and a handsome face is only a small part of the requirement. Some are picked for good performance, some are picked for having large gear or nuts, and some for both.<br>  <br>  Some are picked for the amount of wad they pump out, others for how long the pump in getting it out.<br>  <br>  In porn you aren't always seeing what you think that you see. There are scenes where there is tube hidden on the other side of an actors Dick, attached with skin adhesive. When he ejaculates, they pump almost pudding white mixture through the tube and it looks like a quart of c*um flying through the air in pulses and accumulation somewhere like on a face. You can tell by looking at it that it isn't really semen.<br>  <br>  Now think for a second...how many Ladies in real life too, want their faces smothered and dripping with semen running down all over it? Is there some hidden excitement for them in it?<br>  <br>  This so is not reality and makes for warped perception.<br>  You aren't going to be able to do that unless you fake it in filming like they do.<br>  <br>  Me! :- )|`|b2d07243a56fe86e58deeafb008493abaa	movies can make anything happen, they makes the men in porn shoot more c*m than is humanly possible with fake movie making tricks<br>  men only shoot about a teaspoon or two of c*m|`|mMmNEljxaa	I say, maybe he was saving it up for the occasion it may have been a Valentines Day treat, I could say so Sir.|`|pFm2kga5aa	well that depends on how old you are and how big your Testes (balls) are it is different for everybody
VCIZJQCJaa	Bone cancer types are considered to be one of the most dangerous types of this illness and they require great care and specific treatment.but beyond dangerous bone cancer can be extremely painful.if you think about it every time you move bones are involved so every time you move with bone cancer it hurts.in children it is usually called  Ewing's sarcoma or osteosarcoma,it is diagnosed with x-rays and imaging tests.usually surgery is involved and chemotherapy.i don't know exactly why kids are more likely to get this perhaps it is genetic or more likely  the amount or TOXINS in society,and some kids get knocked around more in sports|`|1jwk8LHAaa	hi you can found information about your problem in this blog <a href="http://drugtreatmentforcancer.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://drugtreatmentforcancer.blogspot.c...</a><br>  <br>  thx:)

It seems like the shaving is causing the irritation. Also if pad are irritating you should try tampons.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	It could be a number of things.  Can you switch pads first?  Try it to see if that helps.  Seems like the waxing thing might irritate your skin more, but I think they make sensitive-skin waxing products...might try going to a professional first if that's the route you want to take.<br>  <br>  Irritated...do you mean you're just sore, or is it actual ingrown hairs?  I've heard lots of GOOD stuff about Bikini Zone, which is found in stores in the shaving aisle.  I've bought it, but have yet to try it.  That might be an option.  Good luck!
Vk7kkrcLaa	try the freshlook colourblends true sapphire. it looks really good on brown eyes. turquoise tends to look obviously fake and gray is nice but maybe a little too common. It can make you look pale and drained out sometimes

The molecules in green tea are very stable and non-reactive, in fact, most of the benefits of green tea stay stable until they exit your system, there is no chemical reaction when making green tea and not much of one after you drink it whether it's hot or cold.|`|veMA1a6paa	Ive heard that drinking water or green tea ice cold is better than drinking it warmer.

Desitin is good for soothing irritated skin, it is diaper rash crème.  If it is a fungus get some athletes foot crème like lotramin (sp)   and apply before bed.  Make sure your hands are not being exposed to any external food like sugar starch etc.  You are not a baker by trade are you?  Also, make sure you too cut down on the foods that feed fungus, like sweets and starches, ie donuts pastry etc.   <br>  Have you been exposed to anything lately, chemicals, waste, etc?<br>  If you are afraid of using a chemical fungal crème then the health food store has some great topical anti-fungal preparations,<br>  *tea tree oil- it smells strong but i like the smell put it on straight or mix with a lotion that you like.<br>  *H202- hydrogen peroxide.  you can mix this with a gentle hand soap about 50/50 and wash your hands with it several times per day.  It will be runny so put it on and rub it around for a good while before rinsing.<br>  *Important,  look in to getting some.. <br>  beta 1,3 glucan.  It is a food supplement made from of all things fungus.  It is a sugar molecule that comes from the cell wall of Bakers Yeast.  It dramatically boosts the immune system and is the best all around supplement I know of.  There are a lot of expensive brands with different levels of glucan.  I like NOW brand because it is cheap and of good quality.  Take about 500mg per day on empty stomach with 8oz of water.

Rvs1mVqwaa	No one likes to hear this, but it sounds like an anxiety attack.  Some people cry, some have chest pain and shortness of breath....some have bowel problems.  Next check up with a doc, let them know what happens.

Yep Its bad but I'm used to it.|`|EUKTs1BUaa	You could have irritable bowel syndrome. I would take a good look at what you are eating. Also research this syndrome online and learn all you can about it if this is what you got. Nutrition and eating the right foods may help alot.........|`|tkpBDLwYaa	I agree with Sandy.  It sounds very much like anxiety.  You have this awful feeling in the pit of your stomach, your body reacts.  Your other symptoms also sound very much like some sort of anxiety syndrome.  It may be specific to what's going on around you right now, or it may be something you were born with.  It's most definitely not pleasant, and your mom's reaction may be her way of coping.  It's not that she doesn't care about you.  She may feel the same, but is telling you what she was told.<br>  <br>  Best advice is to get some counseling so you know you are not the only one dealing with this, and let your mom know the earlier you do it, the better off you will be in the long run.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with you.

Remember, there is always someone better than you out there.|`|h2kMk88faa	I concur with the statement about "improving your grammer."

c7YVksUlaa	Its good to ask your guy how he likes it, some guys have things way off limits, others like kinky stuff.  Like the guy above who likes a finger in the butt....I'd freak out if you did that to me!<br>  <br>  Here are my general tips: never use your teeth, never bite, keep everything wet, look up at him.  I love it when my g/f looks into my eyes and smiles while sucking, that is the biggest turn on!<br>  <br>  Oh, and don't stop when he reaches orgasm...keep going just a little longer, it feels so good!  I also like my g/f to run her free hand over my lower stomach and thighs, gently with her nails caressing softly.  Stay steady, you can speed up towards the end, but try to stay steady. (I'm gonna stop here, just the thought is making me hard...)<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you can swallow gracefully, do it. If you don't want to swallow, keep a tissue nearby to discreetly spit in.

Place your tongue under the head of his penis and run your tongue up and down from the tip to the base. You will feel him respond if you are doing the right thing. WATCH YOUR TEETH. This is a mans favorite part of his body and he will not tolerate teeth marks. During this process you will begin to taste his Pre come, it will be sort of thick and salty . When he shoots you may choke on his semen because it is thick and warm and sticky , so be prepared. Better yet use a condom. The deeper in your throat he can put his penis. the More intense it will be for him. good luck|`|ZIOLl00xaa	start off by teasing him a bit and play with the tip. make sure you keep your teeth secure behind your lips.

VZIPRJ3eaa	His metabolism would slow.  His body still needs energy but it would jump into 'Starvation Mode', which is what happens when your body realizes it doesn't get the calories it needs for energy.  So.. all day long, his body will convert muscle to glucose for energy.  It won't touch his fat because fat is the last thing the body uses for energy when it senses 'Starvation Mode'.  <br>  <br>  In effect, he'll actually look worse.. not better, because now he's got less muscle and the same amount of fat.  <br>  <br>  This is why you have to eat the correct amount of calories daily (generally about 2400 - 2600 for men) and then exercise to lose fat.  Only then does your metabolism stay high and your fat get burned.. instead of muscle.|`|uwp2ttSBaa	It would actually do much more harm than good. When you begin to starve your body begins breaking down its fat stores, and in extreme cases muscles too, though usually not in one day. He really wouldn't lose weight, and the minute he did eat anything the body is programmed to replenish the fat. Not drinking anything would be even worse, your body NEEDS water to lose weight. Water is the main thing that flushes unwanted substances from your body (through urine, sweat, saliva, blood)|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It doesn’t really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	If losing weight were that easy, we would be a nation of skinnies wanting to learn how to gain weight.<br>  <br>  However, he would be very thirsty and probably very hungry.|`|fecUjSr1aa	you're talking about an obese man not eating for a day?<br>  <br>  the answer is NOTHING ... you don't lose weight in one day or even one week. obesity is a body disorder that cannot be cured by not eating. some people do gastric bypass surgery, some indulge in a long term exercise-diet program to deal with the problem.<br>  <br>  side effects of not eating? how about hunger? and then after that, all the more he will eat a lot. the intestines do not stop processing food and when there's no food to process, they grind themselves, and then develop ulcer .. is it worth the risk? he might end up spending more on medicine that he would on food.<br>  <br>  i'm not trying to scare you here but i'm just stating from proven facts.<br>  <br>  you want more information ... try <a href="http://www.webmd.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com</a> .. there a lot of things you can learn from there. <br>  <br>  here at yahoo answers, unless you chance upon a real expert doctor, all you get is general knowledge answers ...|`|Cfsn8GOUaa	Decent response by Mase, except for the Detox Diet.

v8Jw4wRPaa	Obviously without being your doctor or seeing you, I can't diagnose you. But it sounds to me like Irritable Bowel Syndrome. This is more common in females, often in the teenage years, and often causes a hardened stomach, bloated feeling, and mild to severe constipation.<br>  <br>  Irritable Bowel Syndrome affects a large number of people, and people find it easier to control by cutting out or increasing certain foods. Even if you don't have IBS, taking these simple tips may well get rid of your problems:<br>  <br>  1. Cut out yeast and gluten. Look for foods that say they are gluten-free or 'suitable for Coeliacs' and buy brown bread, pasta, and rice rather than white. Another possibility is of course, that you have Coeliacs Disease (an allergy to gluten, pronounced See-lee-acks) as this would also match your symptoms.<br>  <br>  2. Eat yoghurt with added probiotic cultures such as lactobacillus and streptococcus. These aid the digestive system and bifidus digestivum specifically slows digestive transit in order to minimise bloating.<br>  <br>  3. Eat foods rich in fibre. Often breakfast cereals will have added fibre. Whole grains and raw vegetables will do the job. Increasing your intake of vegetables, preferrably but not only raw, is particularly helpful in correcting this sort of problem.<br>  <br>  4. Cut out chocolate, caffeine (so tea, coffee, Coca Cola), and alcohol, if you consume any already.<br>  <br>  5. Reduce your intake of red meat if possible.<br>  <br>  6. If you are taking any iron supplements, discontinue them or lower the dosage as these can cause intestinal problems and in particular constipation.<br>  <br>  Also, keep going back to your doctor if this problem doesn't go away. It is your doctor's responsibility to diagnose you if you have a serious problem, and sometimes persistence is the key with a condition that is restricting your everyday life but difficult to diagnose.|`|fhzVMPBvaa	it might just be your period.maybe it is pms or pmdd which is a little more serious,ask your doctor about that and look up PMDD symptoms.maybe you could get on Yaz,which helps releive PMDD.<br>  <br>  for now,go easy on salty/sugary foods.dont drink soda/coffe drinks.not too much water either cuz water causes bloating.try exercising a little and you will see bloating go down,its probably nothing serious.|`|0Xl4wZpMaa	omg... maybe its ure period? or it can be something more serious if it keeps on hurting i think u should go to the emergency room. but it might just be like food poisining and like ure body hasnt been able to get rid of it thats all.|`|4lQ5AuUcaa	probably a tumor.

You may have some sort of issue with the stomach muscle itself not emptying properly.|`|qGBklnngaa	hmm, What did your doctor actually say was wrong? You could need a scan just to make sure there's nothing "growing" inside. It is definitely not normal, what you are experiencing, but could well be nothing to worry about. Sometimes, our digestion can become eratic and slow for no reason, so try taking activia yoghurt to reduce the bloating. It could be an intolernace to dairy or gluten, or anything, so why not try to cut these out of your diet and see if these reduce the bloating. It could also be stress, muscle tension or even pre-menstrual pain and bloating. I would persue this with your doctor though, goodluck!|`|uhheZyfAaa	try taking a laxative, and drink more water|`|AA10524071	Try not to eat late at night and don't eat too much fiber or raw veggies, drink lots of water.|`|5cSD8mcZaa	There is the possibility of an obstruction, but it sounds more like you might need a good cleaning out. Not anything major like a "high colonic" but perhaps an antacid and/or a laxative with a stool softener in it.<br>  <br>  Bowels should move at least once a day and sometimes more when you do not drink enough fluid or are not very active. Try doing some chores around the house, cleaning your room and keep those liquids up, and you should see a noticeable difference. <br>  <br>  The main point is to stay regular, and a lot of doctors recommend fiber supplements like Metamucil so that you are less likely to have constipation problems.
305UhTfjaa	Nah.. yearly deaths from alcohol and tabacco are so highh up in numbers. while marijuana always seems to stay at zero.. so i doubt there's anything too wrong with it.<br>  Watch some marijuana documentaries.. they have a lot of good facts.|`|8nm2psyKaa	Yea EXACTLY what HYPHY said...|`|IZ1ZZHyCaa	No...its not bad for U...but i think smoking period is bad...if U smoke it once nothing is going to happen....they say that it can cure people..if they got cataracts....|`|Ebecdbt1aa	Any kind of smoke is "bad for you" to inhale...your lungs were designed to breathe air, not smoke obviously.<br>  <br>  That being said, all of the air you breathe outside has smoke, and tons of other chemical or carbon compounds floating around in it...<br>  <br>  To get a handle on how "bad" it is, you need to compare it to something else.<br>  <br>  For example, tobacco....  is a highly addictive LEGAL narcotic that kills hundreds of thousands of adults each year and millions if we're including the unborn.<br>  <br>  A lot of things in life are bad for you, ironically these are things people enjoy most.....  butter, salt, sugar, coffee, tobacco, alcohol  ...drunk sex, fried food.  All of which are legal.<br>  <br>  You can become chemically / psycologically addicted to anything you "enjoy", because your enjoyment releases endorphines in your brain (liquid happiness).  Humans are fundamentally addicted to "joy".  In this sense Marijuana is highly addictive....because it's just so damn good (to those who like it).<br>  <br>  The same principle applies to chocolate.   If I told you you could never eat another chocolate bar or anything that contains "caffeine", because now it's illegal....(why is it illegal ? - Answer: "because caffeine is addcitive and bad for you").....would you listen ? would you obey, like a good citizen ?<br>  <br>  I think marijuana should be legal, we should end prohibition, ..for the same reasons we ended prohibition of Alcohol. To reduce organized crime, regulate consumption and sales, while generating revenue through sales tax and tariffs.<br>  <br>  If the only reason marijuana is illegal,...is because it's "bad for you"...then there's a lot of things that shouldn't be legal right now.  Fast food is bad for you....should we outlaw Big Macs ?<br>  <br>  Michael Phelps,...Nine gold medals....  smokes marijuana.  Does anyone believe that he would have nine gold medals if he smoked cigarettes instead ?  Both of which are "bad" for you, but the one that is worse is legal ?...why is that ?... I think most people already know why.  $|`|axiA5mMoaa	Not if you don't care about your brain cells, I mean some people don't need all of their brain cells anyway.

dpgXzMenaa	For some girls, it hurts a lot... for others, only a little... for still others, it doesn't hurt at all. Same with bleeding... and there's no way to really know which it's going to be for you until it happens.<br>  <br>  You're ready for sex as soon as you want to do it *and* are comfortable and happy with the following... and if you're not comfortable with *all* of it, you're probably not ready, no matter what age you are:<br>  <br>  First... really be *sure* you wanna "do it" with the guy you've chosen.<br>  <br>  You're a virgin, and your first full-on sex should be with someone you're really gonna want to *be* that intimate with for a while, and I don't just mean the physical intimacy of openly sharing your bodies and their reactions without shame... because there's a lot of mental and emotional stuff that comes with the hormones and hangups that fill the sexual territory between partners. You'll be MUCH better and happier for choosing such a person, even if that "while" only turns out to be a few weeks... trust me on this point, OK? <br>  <br>  First-timing can be pretty disappointing for girls, not just because it's often painful (at least at first), but also because nervousness and awkwardness for both of you can make it very difficult for *you* to concentrate on your own pleasure. You don't have to worry too much about *his* pleasure: except for some possible emotional stuff, he's going to enjoy it a *lot* - even his first time. Young men are lucky that way, sure, but it's also a very rare man indeed (but not at all a rare woman) who can have several orgasms in less than half an hour. :-)<br>  <br>  Advice? Tips? Good things to plan for and think about?<br>  <br>  Make sure you have lots of total privacy for quite a long time (three hours or more is a good idea) because not only might there be some uncomfortable, embarrassing or painful moments along the way, but there's more to the first time than just "doing it", and you'll have a lot of stuff to talk about afterwards - you do *not* want any of this to be interrupted.<br>  <br>  When it comes to intercourse, tell your guy that *you* will be the one to say "stop" if anything's wrong (like pain, or even if you just chicken out) and that it's up to him to remember that when you tell him "stop".<br>  <br>  If it should happen that your first time *will* be painful, bracing yourself against pain will only make it worse. RELAX... as he enters you, try pushing just a little bit as if you're trying to pee - this will relax your pelvic muscles and *greatly* diminish any discomfort or pain.<br>  <br>  Don't even *try* unless you're very turned on and very slippery... a couple of orgasms first by masturbating/oral (*before* intercourse!) will also help your vagina to be more relaxed, stretchier and more insistent on having something inside - and if you don't get very wet no matter how horny you are, have some water-based lube (KY, Astroglide, Wet or similar) handy and no matter what, go SLOW until you're comfortable.<br>  <br>  That lube will also help prevent breakage of the condom. Yes, the condom. There's a name for people who rely on "pulling out" as a method of avoiding pregnancy: "parents"... or sometimes "parents with STDs".<br>  <br>  Any pain you may feel will go away in a few minutes to a couple of days (sometimes there's a little bruising), and after it's over with, each time will be *much* better if you stick to everything above.<br>  <br>  Oral sex is also fine any time at all for either person, at least if both of them are comfortable with it and enjoy it. Doing it until the person receiving has an orgasm is nicest, but that isn't necessary unless you both want it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Source(s):<br>  I'm a guy, and I'm almost 50 years old, but I would have benefited hugely from most of this advice myself the first time *I* had sex - at age 13. No regrets, but I know now that we both would have fared a lot better if we'd thought about these things even for a few days.<br>  <br>  Since then, I've raised 4 kids who've grown up to be fairly responsible and (more important) sexually healthy people. I'd *like* to think that their mothers and I were the ones who helped them to become that way.|`|BRDqfAy3aa	read below - everything about First Time Sex|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	it was a throbbing pain for a few hours.<br>  <br>  having blood drawn is nothing  compared to sex.|`|BIg5bWkMaa	it honestly doesnt compare to anything. just lube it up and take it slow|`|LMRaSXFeaa	it didnt really hurt my first time, it just felt like if you havent had sex for like three months and then you get back into it, not that bad.|`|MXRXG62oaa	its just a little bit of burning/stretching... not bad though. my man went very slow, very gentle...<br>  <br>  he had fingered me before which really helped to reduce the pain.<br>  breaking the hymens the worst, but that can be done through fingering.

6wKW0urqaa	A few years ago I had a slight problem with the drink myself. And there is no way in hell I would go to a group counselling session. I sat and thought about all the times I would drink in the week, it was mostly on nights when I was alone and had nothing to do. So I decided that instead of wasting my time on the bottle I was going to do something constructive. I taught myself to play guitar, to draw, and went through countless amounts of books. I found learning new things gave me a great sense of accomplishment, took my mind off everything else. I still drink on occasions, but never alone anymore, and defiantly not as often.|`|9EVcTnUWaa	You need to talk to a therapist who's used to working with people with drinking issues and at the same time is trained in dealing with other psychological problems.  You'll probably have to go into therapy in a clinical setting.  Go for your social phobia first and when you have the intake interview let them know about the drinking and the reason that you can't do the AA thing.  That will let them know what to recommend as a treatment plan.  Call the nearest hospital and ask for their psychiatry department and than set up an intake interview. They will be able to take it from there.  IF you live in a large city, than look for a hospital that also deals with addiction issues, that will ensure that you can find a therapist who'll be able to help you.|`|3y9AlP6Raa	Your not an alchoholic.<br>  Find another excuse for attention.<br>  <br>  Alcoholism is an illness. not a fad or fashion, those with it are real and need help instead of monies being wasted on the `unloved`.|`|17vLpGIBaa	Try aa. it might work.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	True.

0OB7yAFwaa	I honestly think that you are pregnant and you just happen to be a women who continues her menstrual cycle throughout the pregnancy. I know a few women where that has happened, and they went to a doctor to see if they were pregnant. So have you been to a doctor? If not, I suggest you go to one ASAP to find out what's going on. I don't think the watery discharge was because of the prenatal vitamins, it may just be your body building up the lining for the baby and some slipped out. I'm not sure, but I strongly suggest you go to a doctor. I really hope that helps you out. :)

One of my moles was removed in 5 days time, none of them took longer than 10 days to be completely removed.<br>  <br>  I would recommend Dermatend because it uses only natural ingredients, and it comes with a 100% guarantee. I ordered Dermatend at www.mole-wartremoval.com which is a web store by amazon.com, buying a product I wasn't too sure about from a large website, really gave me a good feeling if you know what I mean.

xsizQ5X1aa	To me it sounded like that was your first REAL high off weed. I started smoking and had done so about a dozen times before I really got high. Had the same sort of experiences you occurred, felt like everything was spinning, couldn't remember anything about anything, but would warp back into reality for a moment just to go back in.<br>  <br>  Actually most of my friends didn't get high the first time, it took them about a dozen times or so before they actually did it.<br>  <br>  If you smoke again, I'd do it at a safe location, it won't be as intense, but will still be a fun time, as long as you remember not to freak out.|`|aXjRf1UFaa	It's bescause it was your first time the first time is always the time you get the highest a way to stop this is stop getting high it can cause lung cancer and mouth cancer if you want to live a healthy life it would probably be better to stop getting high|`|7585zXZIaa	okay so to hide it use visine for red eyes. Then play it off like you are tired so yawn a lot and wear like a big hoodie and wear the hood when you can. You will look like you got very little sleep but people wont think you're high. and yeah thats what happens when my friends do|`|AA11590358	id say either it was laced with something, or its just not for you.|`|FeRC5jkoaa	This is very normal for your first time trust me. The first time smoking pot is always super intense, my first time I did it at my friends house and we walked down to the stop sign and i completely forgot what happened 5 seconds ago and started getting scared... Then i forgot who i was, and who my parents were.. then i couldn't stop laughing. I began to walk home and i felt like it took me an hour when its only a 5 minute walk.. I also thought it was like 2 o'clock in the morning when it was only 8.. Its totally normal trust me lol. Theres nothing like the first high .|`|fbHA13meaa	sounds not to fun huh? thats what it does 2 u...u feel either really good and like it or like crap. i hope u now know it felt like crap and wont do it again. do u play sports? it can effect ur game and make u play worse cuz ur lungs and health|`|tfL7zaxMaa	Your first time getting high is usually pretty crazy.

Probably with PCP. Usually you do not get high your first time if it is regular pot. Can you hook me up with your dealer?|`|aL0OCQG3aa	Dude that was laced with something, dont buy from that dealer again.|`|2RInFX4Qaa	Your First Time is always your biggest High Lol|`|ZIu4DVslaa	i hope that you know that people can track down who u r by sending this|`|x2DweOpqaa	well since it was your first time getting high, your tolerance is really low, thus getting higher than a regular weed smoker would. it's normal to have an extreme high if you smoke enough. if you didn't smoke a lot, then it's possible that the weed was laced (especially since you usually don't get high your first time). extreme highs are different for everyone, but basically it's normal to trip like that.<br>  <br>  when you're high, you get paranoid and feel like people can tell that you're high. but usually, others can't tell unless you're REALLY high. kids that smoke before school probably use visine for their eyes, and then just chill. they're used to it, so they don't freak out.<br>  <br>  if you caugh a lot lot after smoking, it's possible that your vision can be more shaky.|`|an23kSIaaa	yes it is.... it could be that you were breathing through your nose and not through your mouth!!! (trust me it happens) usually that means that you were not able to handle the amount of pot that you smoked.... <br>  <br>  you can't keep yourself from looking high, if you can't handle smoking the pot....<br>  <br>  no it does not, it just mans that the inhalations that you are taking are too big...|`|CU8ezQVHaa	Oh, please don't damage your body like that! It does sound like the drugs you did were strong. But you didn't handle it well, no one does! It's just damaging your brain and body! I DO NOT recommend that you do it again, OR go to school like that. You may even be allergic, who knows. Better, Who can tell you? It's illegal!|`|neZIwHlTaa	1. not normal, was obviously laced <br>  2. if its laced or your on pills, its not easy to keep it hidden, especially w/ hallucinogens. none of it is easy to hide really, but sometimes teachers just wont call you out<br>  3. coughing doesnt get you higher|`|putvW0fIaa	that was definatly laced. maybe chewy? my boyfriend smoked some that was laced with coke and he didnt know. he felt like he would black out for periods of time and he wouldnt know where he was or what he was doing. could that be it?|`|jDbuHPBeaa	It was either laced, or some fire *** ****. <br>  That could be normal, I've had some pretty intense experiences.<br>  It might've been mixed with salvia, a mild hallucinogenic drug.|`|kr1yr9Nmaa	it was probably cuz it was your first time<br>  no its not normal everything is the same when your high but everything is funnier|`|MZHXUcXbaa	No but that happened to me once onetime i closed my eyes i thought i was in a different world it was ****** up<br>  usually its a lot more chill|`|bQFLPh7Vaa	That's not normal at all... it probably had something else than just weed. Give it some hours... it should be going away.|`|fTcS9TJuaa	Damn, u had soom good green!<br>  <br>  Just take it easy on it! to much can kill you shortly!|`|PaFkPZlYaa	dude that weed was spiked with something. that is not normal, trust me.|`|K1eNpai4aa	I've been smoking a long time. From my experience coughing does get you "more high" because it opens up the capillaries in your lungs. I personally don't cough much anymore since I've been doing it for a long time. There are two different types of called Indica and Sativa. Indica gives a much stronger body high that relaxes you and all of your muscles. Sativa is much more of an energetic head high. You probably have only smoked indica because it is much easier to find as it grows more easily. As you smoke more you will cough less and less and you will also learn how to control yourself better while high. Depending on how much i smoke I can usually handle myself around anyone and if you put in a little Visine no one can tell. As for if that was a normal "weed high" it all depends on how much you smoke of what type of weed. It also depends on the quality of the bud and how big you are as a person. You probably were just not ready for it and since it was your first time you were surprised.<br>  <br>  Happy tokin!|`|8j7FCEOraa	Well, if it was one of your first times it could be a normal high.<br>  If you smoked often I'd be concerned.<br>  Are you sure nothing was laced with the weed? If you dont know/trust the person you got it from, dont smoke it.<br>  Yes coughing alot will get you more high.
lYQgf4sCaa	that should do the trick but you might want to look at full body training to start with. split training tends to be for more experienced weight lifters looking to bulk up. Also it's better for burning fat e.g 6 exercises, 3 sets, 15 reps (lower weight, higher reps for fat burning and toning)  Make sure you listen to your body as that is alot of working out for a beginner.. don't overtrain. A split routine can sometimes be more demanding and might cause a beginner to quit before they see any results. doing full body would also give you a couple of days off. this is a good thing as the body needs rest right... As long as you're in it for the long haul you should be right. There is no quick fix it's a lifestyle change. good luck mate.|`|2eW4z4Hmaa	this looks pretty interesting|`|QzU5QrZYaa	No it will not be effective. You are missing SOOO much with that plan. Where's your chest, where's your back. As well as that what parts of your arms are you going to work what parts of your legs are you going to work.

Lots of things.  Cut back on your carbs too.

NLAek2bJaa	The dentist is trying to diagnose the problem basically on the whole side where it hurts, so yes he does look at all the teeth in the one xray. You may think one tooth is hurting but it may be the one next to it. They look at all of them to make sure there are no other problems any where else. It is ok, they know what they are looking for and if there was a problem, Im sure he would have told you. Just if problems persist or pain gets worse, let them know. Follow instructions that they may have given you to take care of the problem.|`|tMdXnnRQaa	They look at all teeth in the picture......as adjacent teeth could be causing the problem as well....not to worry.

7sPa32GSaa	You should start counting calories because even though you're eating healthier, you may be eating MORE calories.  You gain weight by excess calories that you don't burn.  Try keeping track of food you eat with a free website like www.sparkpeople.com (my favorite) or www.mypyramidtracker.gov or similar.  It helps to make sure you're not eating too many calories.  Another problem could be you're not eating enough calories and your body is in starvation mode and storing it all as fat.  Sounds annoying, but make sure you're eating within your recommended calorie range for your age/gender and eat 1/2 as many calories as you burn (for example, you burn 300 calories, eat an extra 150).|`|KASMkR5Maa	ok u need to change you diet exersize with unhealthy food will cause you too loose flab and if you dont burn offf clories stay.<br>  <br>  advice foods to eat after working out<br>  eggs plane oatmeal turkey brest chicken brest fruits and vegies <br>  make shore to eat oat meal it will help you build musle stay away from breads inless it whole weat and all add fiber|`|FaVYRoXqaa	If you're still eating more food than your body needs, you will gain weight.

Deppends on many things, your metabolism, age, health, size, diet and so on.<br>  The best thing to loose weight and keep it is portion control. It is really simple and easy. Also, instead of eating three or more big meals a day, try spreading it out to 6 or 8 smaller meals. That will make you burn more calories digesting and it wont keep you hungry.

AA11065140	I think you're misunderstanding Anorexia.  Anorexics don't stop eating because they're stressed, or eat when they're hungry.  They stop eating because they have a misconception that they're fat.  They eat when - and only when - they can control their caloric intake.  And nobody is "Anorexic from time to time".  Certainly, many of us get stressed out and have low appetites from time to time, but this does not mean we're Anorexic...it just means we're stressed out and have a low appetite.  <br>  <br>  Anorexia is a psychiatric disorder that doesn't go away, and often feeds on itself.  As Anorexics gain "control" over their diet, it becomes much like a physical addiction.  Think of it like you think of alcoholism - it's a lifelong problem that requires the patient to work for "normalcy" for the rest of their lives.|`|IKOsBOIyaa	um, if you starve yourself, so you look good, you have issues. it's really bad for you. and yes, you are killing yourself faster... people who are overweight die of heart desiese at around 50, people who wont eat die in 30s from lack of nutrition.|`|2hb0Lr2Raa	there is no cure for how your brain functions... it's like major drug addiction|`|iikdZKO7aa	The Eating Disorder, Anorexia, is a unique reaction to a variety of external and internal conflicts, such as stress, anxiety, unhappiness and feeling like life is out of control. Anorexia is a negative way to cope with these emotions<br>  <br>  Anorexia is often classed as a mental disorder, as sufferers convince themselves of things (about themselves) that usually are not true or severely exaggerated.<br>  Sufferers can learn to control their life and eating habits to prevent falling back into the cycle of anorexia. But as with any mental disorder itcan not be cured as there are always possibilities that it can be triggered, often by a stressful event. Statements such as you have used above  (You get stressed out you lose your appetite. That's not your fault that is how your body reacts to stress, If you eat when you are hungry and only hungry and maintain your weight then why is it such a bad thing that people are anorexic from time to time during stressful periods) are perfect examples of trying to rationalise the disorder. As for the statement about not killing yourself, you are. By starving your body, or binging you are putting major stress on all your internal organs. Anorexics often suffer organ failure due to this fact.<br>  Both my Aunts suffer with this and getting to the stage of seeing them with feeding tubes in as they would not eat and their body was shutting down is one of the worst things to see in a person you care about. You really need to speak to someone as you abvously have not grasped all aspects of this disorder and you could find yourself on a downward spiral.|`|qGh1HhPwaa	"from time to time" with anything is ok, but then it turns into a monster<br>  <br>  "It's not like we are killing ourselves faster than people that overeat and that are overweight" Remember Karen Carpenter (maybe not)|`|MRDJu8v3aa	Anorexia is not like most other diseases. It is an emotional/psychological disorder. All psychological disorders are extremely hard to treat and for all intense and purposes, impossible to cure. Like alcoholics say, once an alcoholic, always an alcoholic. <br>  <br>  Anorexia is best described as a self-image and self-loathing problem. I have talked to a lot of very beautiful women who, no matter what anyone told them, thought they were extremely ugly and overweight. It is not that they just fasted for a day or two. They had prolonged time of eating disorders such as eating too little, exercising too much, vomiting, taking weight control products, etcetera, in an attempt to lose weight unnecessarily.  I knew one women who drank Ipecac  at least 4 times a week. <br>  <br>  Often, anorexia is accompanied by depression. While we have wonderful meds for depression, there is little we can do for the anorexia. Long term psychotherapy is the only way to manage it. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the danger is that not only to they lose fat, they also lose muscle… including damaging their hearts. The damage to the heart is often irreversible. <br>  <br>  It is hard to say whether or not your fasting to lose weight is a sign that you are anorexic but be careful. Look at a weight chart to see if you really are overweight and ask a doctor for guidance in losing weight.
28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	1) It hurts about a 1, unless you are not fully numb. I only give it a 1 because the Novacaine shot can be a little ouchy. You WILL feel pressure, and hear the drills and such in your mouth...this is what normally freaks people out. Other than that, you feel nothing.<br>  <br>  2) The procedure involves hollowing drilling down and clearing all of the cavity, and then building your tooth back up with filling and supports. It takes up to 2 hours depending onthe severity. Average is about 1 - 1.5 hours.<br>  <br>  3) Not too much pain afterwards either. You may feel a bit of soreness, but nothing more than a Motrin would treat. The only pain for me is in my jaw, from holding it open for so long.<br>  <br>  4) You will be numb after the procedure for about 2 hours. No worries, you can take up the time by making funny faces at yourself lol.<br>  <br>  5) YES> there is a numbing gel that they can put on the gum area before you even get the Novacaine shot...my dentist calls it Magic Gel, so I'm not really sure what its called...but they should know what you mean if you ask<br>  <br>  6) Nobody. Its considered a minor surgical procedure, so everyone in the room must be sterile. Also, since there are so many small tools, etc around while they are doing it, somebody else can easily get in the way.<br>  <br>  7) Make sure you eat beforehand. If you don't you may get nausious. Also, its hard to eat for 5 or so hours afterwards, so you'll be super hungry. If you have any kind of allergies [runny nose type] make sure to take medicine before hand, because it SUCKS to have a runny nose while they are working on your mouth. Don't drink a lot of liquid before hand, because it also sucks to have to go pee while they are working on your mouth. DURING: Ask your Dr if they have those movie goggles...they are like glasses that you put on, and you can watch a movie while they are working on your mouth. If not, ask if they can play a CD of yours, or better yet, if you can bring your iPOD. There's not much to do during the root canal, so its nice to have something to concentrate on. Turn your phone on Vibrate LOL...mine was on last time I went to the Dentist, and it rang 3 times while I was in there...luckily my dentist enjoyed the Pink Panther Ringtone :)  AFTER: Don't drink anything carbonated [beer, soda etc] for about 48 hours, as the carbonation can loosen the large filling you just got. Take a Motrin while you are STILL numb, that way you don't feel any pain after the numbness goes away. Eat soft food that night, so you don't put any pressure on it. Until you get a crown, don't chomp on any hard food with that tooth, as the filling might break<br>  <br>  Good luck, and remember...it doesn't hurt to get procedures done by the dentist...it just scares a lot of people because you are very aware of what they are doing. Bring your iPod, and you can concentrate on something else the whole time...just make sure not to sing along LOL<br>  <br>  UPDATE: Forgot to mention this, but when they do a Root Canal, they remove all of the nerves in your tooth. Because of that, it shouldn't hurt afterwards, just the gums and jaw around it. If you are still feeling pain after 2 days or so, go back to the Dentist and ask them to do an XRay of your tooth to make sure they got everything.|`|XZlFLecLaa	i just had one done two days ago... what hurts kinda is the shots of novicane... it hurts but is bearable... it feels really uncomfortable afterwards ... not like an ow pain but like an annoying pain... hard to describe - sorry... <br>  it took about 2 hours start to finish ... waiting room, waiting for novicane to take... etc.<br>  you will still be numb for a few hours after ... mine lasted about 5 hours but i could feel it wearing away gradually... <br>  <br>  with the novicane you really dont feel anything while its getting done... the novicane shot is the worst ... BUT its not that bad ... just a pinch... dont focus on it... there will be a few places they will put the novicane... so thats the worst part... ask for pain killers for after-- and take them once the novicne starts wearing off... <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  i get super nervus at the dentist but they made me go in alone... just take deep breaths ... try to stay calm and try not to focus on it... im going in to have my crown put on tomorrow... uuugghh! <br>  <br>  its really frusturating and annoying-- good luck!|`|efLPLAt9aa	so i have never had this done but my mom did she said it doesn't hurt very much while it is getting done it just feels uncomfortable but it gets sore for a bit after . good luck|`|DkVofG9paa	1- i would say hurts about a 2-3<br>  <br>  2- procedure will take about 30-45 minutes<br>  <br>  3-the worst part about it is feeling the drills.  my tooth was so bad that i could feel her working on my nerve so it hurt a bit for me for a split second<br>  <br>  4-you will feel numbness for an hour or so.  <br>  <br>  5-the dentist will numb you up before they give you a shot to numb your more.  you can call your dentist before and ask them if they have any anti anxeity pill they can give you or something to help for when you first walk in.. they did this for me before.<br>  <br>  6-definitely one person can come in the room with you.  depends on how big the room is and how much room your dentist has if they will allow more people. <br>  <br>  7-i went to work right after my root canal. you will be ok.. it's just a scarry thing to think about.  drink liquids after the root canal and avoid chewing so you dont bit yourself and not feel it. <br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|cYtPfXkJaa	First, don't panic. <br>  <br>  1) Mine was maybe a 1. Almost painless. Just a little bit of pressure. The injection didn't even hurt. If you feel pain, ask for more anasthetic.<br>  <br>  2) Sometimes it is one visit, sometimes two. Mine was two 20 minute appointments. I guess it would take 30 mins if done in one.<br>  <br>  3) The most pain will be before the procedure. During, you are anasthetised. After, you have no nerve left in the tooth. Believe me, it will be such a relief if you currently have toothache. Like I said, don't suffer in silence. If you feel pain during, stop them and ask for more anasthetic.<br>  <br>  4) The numbness lasts for 2-3 hours afterwards. When it wears off, your tooth/jaw may feel sensitive but not painful, because the nerve will have been removed.<br>  <br>  5) I didn't feel a thing in mine. I believe you can ask for a gel that numbs the gum before they inject the anasthetic, but it shouldn't be necessary. They can be painless.<br>  <br>  6) I'm not sure about this one. I was alone, but I'd assume one person would be allowed in. Probably no more than that, but you might as well ask.<br>  <br>  7) My main advice is to relax and breathe. Don't be scared to tell them if something doesn't feel right.<br>  <br>  It's not as bad as people make out. Once it's done, you'll be so relieved! I thanked my dentist a million times, even with my numb face.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.animated-teeth.com/root_canal/t1_root_canal.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.animated-teeth.com/root_canal...</a> - This should help you know what to expect, so you won't be too surprised and scared by anything. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you. I'm sure you'll be pleasantly surprised! x|`|gWlmU1KJaa	hurt when they are doing it?<br>  <br>  no, maybe 2, keeping your mouth open for ages is  the bit i dont like, and the vibes from the drilling<br>  <br>  2, takes about 20-30 mins<br>  <br>  3, slight pain when meds wear off, an hour or so, and will go away in a day or so<br>  <br>  4.  meds will numb you for an hour or so<br>  <br>  5. nope, you already get what he can give you, perhaps ask him to numb the gum with the gel stuff before he injects, to save you feeling that<br>  <br>  6.  one is enough, the dentist has to get around you to work, one to hold your hand!<br>  <br>  7, when you come home, a good rinse with mouthwash to get all the taste out!|`|9J3f4o8qaa	the dentists will put ur gums to sleep ofcourse cuz we'd die from the pain if they didn't xDD<br>  Also we're lucky that the scientists discovered a certain chemical that protects ur immune system from toxic bacteria that grows when u get a root canal! <br>  also when time comes ur able to get teeth restoration if u want ur adult teeth back. <br>  I had very poor dental hygene bcuz of lack of saliva, Im not even 15 yet and my adult teeth are wiggly! but only a little, Im glad its just a little, Ive main tained that status for 5 years with crest and cogate.

After that it's a breeze.<br>  <br>  4) Yes. Quite a while. A few hours or so.<br>  <br>  5) Yes. He should offer you Novocain anyway, but if you can still feel anything on your tooth, request more. It took three shots to make me finally completely numb.<br>  <br>  6) Usually one person can come in the room with you. But some dentists prefer that no one crowds the room at all.<br>  <br>  7) It's not as bad as it sounds at all! Just make sure you're good and numbed. You'll hear some scraping noises, but not feel them. Just remind yourself it's just the noise and you can't feel it. Express any concerns to your dentist and he should be able to talk you through it. Good luck!

Use your hands and mouth at the same time, and be sure to give extra attention to the head of the penis.  Don't worry about gagging if you deepthroat it, guys love the wetness and they love a girl who will get nasty.  also don't forget to pay special attention to the testicles, and that area right between the testicles and the rectum, although i doubt you are to that advanced point yet lol.  most of all just relax, its ur boyfriend

I assume (though I'm VERY much against abortion as a form of birth control) that many women get abortions because they *feel* as if they have no other option and it is their last resort which usually does not end in happiness...<br>  <br>  i did do a quick google search as well and did not find any happy stories but saw MANY unhappy women testimonies...just saying|`|cf5961a316debfb7203fffd630bd740caa	<a href="http://www.imnotsorry.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.imnotsorry.net</a>|`|p0LsYvJTaa	Here's a Web site: <a href="http://www.imnotsorry.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imnotsorry.net/</a><br>  <br>  Testimonials from women who had abortions and are content with their choice.<br>  <br>  I had a termination recently at five weeks' pregnant.

Ddfff5psaa	woah mase that was a long answer for a simple question?? it has about the same amount of calories... the pulp isn't what has all the calories, but it does have all the fiber...|`|cL6CWj2waa	NovaFeel:<br>  <br>  check this website<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novafeel.com/calories/calorie-chart-drinks.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.novafeel.com/calories/calorie...</a>|`|6sPcYQr0aa	By doing that you just took a whole lot of the best things for you from those fruits. Don't juice them, eat them. You take out most of the fiber and great nutrients. <br>  It doesn’t really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.
9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	A good GP will not prescribe you with Valium or any of the Benzo's. They are a poor form of anxiety management. The risks from taking Benzo's simply outweigh the benefits and there is very little benefit to be gained from taking these drugs in the first place. <br>  <br>  Tolerance to these types of drugs will develop very quickly. You only have to take this drug for an average of 3 or 4 days in a row and you will experience some degree of withdrawal. <br>  <br>  An SSRI and CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy), which has a 70% success rate is far more beneficial.|`|Rk46lIBwaa	I hope you don't succeed. Diazepam is a very old, very addictive and very ineffective drug for anxiety with some studies shown it to be LESS effective than placebo.<br>  <br>  Overall the most effective management for anxiety is non pharmacological, it is called CBT, cognitive behavioural therapy. Long term success rates for it are quoted as 70%.<br>  <br>  If there is a time delay SSRI drugs are affective in reducing symptoms.|`|0PQdeKzaaa	Hi you cant convince your doctor to give you those drugs as its already been said valium is the worst you can get ! your doctor will be the 1 that decides what you actually need if in fact you are suffering from anxiety ? normally what you will get described would be something like prozac but they wont prescribe it unless they really have to ... sly|`|VPlKbDplaa	Hi jat<br>  <br>  There are safe herbals you can take instead so why don't you go down that route. ALL prescribed drugs will have some side effects.  <br>  <br>  It could be that you are just deficient or have a higher requirement for the B vitamins right now. B Complex vitamins are known as the anti-stress vitamins.....why don't you try these. They work for me when I am feeling over-anxious. I don't take them all the time just when I feel the need and I take a strong one: B100. But B50 is a good strength to start with, timed-release formulation and you can get this from Holland & Barratt. In addition to that I would also take a Dolomite tablet. It contains magnesium and calcium in the correct ratio (that is optimum for your body) and magnesium is known as the anti-stress mineral and calcium too can help the nerves.<br>  <br>  So I would try B Complex Vitamins and the natural supplement Dolomite. Both can be bough from Holland & Barratt or other large health stores, or online. <br>  <br>  If these don't help, though I think they should, there are herbs you can try instead or as well as.....Lemon balm, Passiflora incarnata (passionflower) or Avena sativa (oat straw). All three can help with anxiety. Try one of these. You can get them in capsule form or you might be able to find a tincture. Bioforce do a tincture of Passiflora with Avena sativa. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps. <br>  Best wishes.|`|zdu3gh8jaa	Along with what others have suggested, have you never thought of meditation and relaxation techniques. I find that regular meditation sessions reduce my stress and anxiety greatly. It's just a suggestion that could be used alongside all other types of medicine. I hope you find something that helps you soon.|`|dtXzOGoKaa	they would probably only give you a one or two week course due to how addictive they are|`|4277201b67af194037740747ba2be513aa	Try asking your doctor for some propranolol instead. It's non addictive - unlike valium - and can be taken long term. It works by blocking the action of adrenaline on the heart so physical symptoms of the anxiety aren't present - your brain then has a chance to calm itself down and you'll feel more chilled out. <br>  <br>  I also take l-theanine for anxiety - it helps you chill out. Also, try passiflora and valerian at night. <br>  <br>  If you're depressed then 5htp can help and it also has the effect of making you less anxious and prone to worry. Take it at night and it will help you get off to sleep. <br>  <br>  Don't start taking valium - it's addictive and the effects don't last, so you'll end up needing larger and larger doses over time. You'll end up dependant and zombiefied. <br>  <br>  Other things to help with anxiety are: magnesium, the vitamin B complex and cutting out caffeine completely - even in tea.<br>  <br>  Don't let the doctor prescribe you an SSRI antidepressant. The effects don't last and the side effects are terrible. Tell him you want some propranolol.|`|fQh5Qkkkaa	For your anxiety, or to get messed up?

m4GfeRy7aa	I don't think theirs anything wrong with you, because I think I know what you're saying cause I went through something like that. I seriously started thinking something was wrong with me, I thought I was bipolar/depressed because I'd be happy one second and sad the other. I wasn't motivated, and the days would just drag on and I would just follow the same routine. Also, other people could sense it, sometimes they'd ask if I was crying. But later on, when I made more friends and found something I was interested in, it all got better. I realized it was just a "phase(?)" I was going through in life and I think you are too.<br>  <br>  My advice to you would be to try to get more focused on something. For me, it was art. Also try to make new friends, or talk more to your old friends, arrange plans to hang-out or something.<br>  <br>  Grades: Sometimes it just happens. Try to find something that really interests you in school and try to focus on it.<br>  Friends: Try to make new friends, one step at a time. People have been betrayed before (ex: me), so don't worry about that.<br>  <br>  P.S. If you do seriously still think somethings wrong with you,  you need to talk to a professional. They'll know if somethings wrong with you, or if it's just a "phase" (don't know if that's the right word). Try talking to your school counselor for help.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, hon! =)|`|OUbNSXjJaa	You should worry only if many things are wrong with you.

Worrying constantly about your mental health will drive you crazy. You know yourself best, sit down with your parents and tell them your needs. Tell them you'll feel better if you see a doctor. You could even show them what you've asked here, if you have trouble finding the right words to get your point across.|`|eD51aBzlaa	it sounds like depression, u should go see a doctor. and then everything will b juss finneee :)|`|MDQtJ0lmaa	I would talk to your parents about seeing a doctor. Due to your symptoms I think you may have ADD, or attention defecate disorder. Talk to your doctor about possibly seeing another doctor and getting some tests done, and also ask him/her if there is any possibility of getting some medicine to help you focus a little more. But in the meantime, try getting better friends who care a little more about grades and school and stuff like that. Also think about getting a tutor. But for a tutor, you don't have to pay tons of money to have somebody come over once a week, instead ask a friend who is in your class and really good at the subject you are studying. I hope this helped!!!|`|OiQSYuE8aa	I had the same situation. i really wanted to do a lot in my life...but some how I couldn'gt concentrate. I had good friends too and i started losing all of them one after another and had the feeling that I don't really have anyone to share my stuffz.I started googling for and reading some quotations that'll boost up my spirit and help me get going and make new friends (while keeping in mind that making a good friend for the time being, not for ever). For me, the most effective quotation was " you're the only one on earth to use your ability." you can search for more.<br>  For making friends, always try to do something helpful for friends, like giving a ride or doing their homework , this way they'll start liking you and you can practise while doing their homework. :)<br>  Hope these  will help.<br>  Hope this will help.|`|zcYmB1Gnaa	You do have another route for help.  There should be a school councilor who you can go to for some advice.  Most schools allow a one time visit without parent permission.  I am a teacher, and yes I think you do need some help.  If you can snap out of this in one or two weeks, it's all normal and a part of growing up, but this sounds like it is going on too long.  You do not want to start spiraling down so low that you can't get back up.  GET HELP.  Your emotional state is affecting your school work and you need to keep your academics up to succeed in this world.  Again, get help and don't wait.  YOU ARE WORTH IT.
mAQHyfCYaa	Sunday start is usually easier. Waiting only 5 days instead of 7 before starting your next pack won't do much harm. I may slightly alter when you get your period by up to a week, though usually only a few days at the most.<br>  <br>  However, to be safe you should use another form of contraceptive (like a condom) for a week after you change your start.

The doctor will then probably do a breast exam, which consists of the doctor quickly checking for abnormal lumps in your breasts, and she will probably do a pelvic exam and pap smear as well. The pelvic exam will consist of the doctor checking to be certain everything is normal "down there"; she will probably put two gloved fingers inside your vagina, and take a peek at your vulva. The pap smear will consist of the doctor putting a speculum in your vagina, which is kind of like a shoehorn, so that he/she can get a clear shot at your cervix, which is all the way at the back of your vagina. After the speculum is inserted, he/she will take a cell sample with a scratchy q-tip to check for cell abnormalities. It sounds invasive, but its over quickly, and it shouldn't hurt at all. At most it will be a little uncomfortable. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f4ef8ccd6e715f516bc37db8d8ec64f9aa	If you're sexually active, they'll definitely perform a pelvic exam aka mess around a little "down there" and probably perform a pap smear. However, I went when I was a teenager (for the same reasons) and not sexually active and they didn't perform any type of pelvic exam. If you're not sexually active, some doctors do full exams, and some don't. But don't worry. I've had both male and female gynos and they've all been extremely professional. There's really nothing to worry about.|`|fZgwb1rqaa	Well I was prescribed on b/c when I was 14 because of acne, and bad cramps. When I went at 14 they didn't do a pap smear or anything they just asked a few questions about my cycle.

Don't stress about it, it's a little awkward and uncomfortable at first but it doesn't last very long.|`|wbuG0efyaa	I went to the gynoecologist for the same reason he put me on birth control to help with it.

It's just good hygiene, and at least you won't be angst-ing about THAT.<br>  <br>  If you use douches, DON'T use one at least 24 hours before a pelvic exam. It could mess up your Pap smear or make it hard to detect a vaginal infection.<br>  <br>  If you get your period the day of the appointment - cancel it and reschedule it for a week or two. Or you could decide to go and just use the time to talk.<br>  <br>  Write down the date of your last period. You should be keeping track of your menstrual cycle. (Check out the Beinggirl Period Calendar in About Me - it's a great tool for charting your period.) You could also write a list of any symptoms that are bothering you to bring to the exam.<br>  <br>  Asking questions<br>  <br>  A pelvic exam is a great opportunity to practice talking about your health. For generations, people never questioned doctors about procedures or medications. Dumb! So ask questions like your health depends on it - it does.<br>  <br>  Before you go, make a list of questions to ask. Using the Glossary at this web site will help you to use the right words when asking your questions. You can also read the sections on Menstruation or Female Anatomy to get a clear picture of what's going on - and get clear on your questions or concerns.<br>  <br>  You can ask your questions before the actual exam, when you're first meeting with the doctor, during the exam, or after. NEVER be afraid to ask questions. If you don't feel comfortable asking or if the doctor isn't answering your questions, you may want to change doctors. You want to be able to ask questions and feel that your doctor is really listening. With any doctor, you should ask what exams they will be doing, why, what the medications are for and what you can expect.<br>  <br>  So here's a checklist of info and things you might want to bring to your pelvic exam:<br>  <br>      * The dates of your last period<br>      * The length of your periods and your cycle<br>      * A list of questions for the doctor and any issues you'd like to discuss<br>      * The names of any medications that you're taking. (Write down the name of the medication and the dose, or just put the bottle in your purse and show the doctor<br>  <br>  You may have questions about S.T.D.'s (sexually transmitted diseases), birth control, or pregnancy. Your doctor can answer specific questions, and probably give you brochures and info on these topics. But you have to remember to ask, so write it down.<br>  <br>  I am going to the gynecologist! What fun!"<br>  <br>  OK - so most of us don't feel EXACTLY that way the first time. We know a pelvic exam (also called a gynecological exam) isn't a trip to the beach, but most girls and women say that their first exam wasn't as bad as they thought. The exam itself is usually painless, and it takes only about 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  Which means it will probably take you longer to read this walkthrough than it will to have an exam. So read on, get informed, and get comfortable. The more you know, the easier it will be.<br>  <br>  Who does pelvic exams?<br>  A lot of different kinds of health care professionals can do pelvic exams. One is a gynecologist (guy-nuh-CALL-uh-jist) - a doctor who specializes in women's reproductive and sexual health. These doctors usually are also obstetricians (called OB/GYNs), who see pregnant women and deliver babies.<br>  <br>  You could also go to a pediatrician, family doctor, or internal medicine specialist. Before you go, find out if these doctors actually do the exams - some prefer to refer you to a gynecologist.<br>  <br>  Some other health practitioners can also do pelvic exams. These include:<br>  <br>      * Nurse practitioner<br>      * Certified nurse clinicican<br>      * Certified nurse midwife<br>      * Physician's assistant<br>      * To keep it simple on this site, we'll use the term "doctor" to talk about the professional doing the pelvic exam.<br>  <br>  You can find a doctor a few ways. A lot of people feel that "word of mouth" is the best. Ask a friend or a female relative who she uses. If you have health insurance, check with your insurance company for a list of participating doctors. You can also ask your family doctor or the school nurse for a referral.<br>  <br>  Why get a pelvic exam?<br>  Usually a pelvic exam is a routine visit. But here are some reasons why a teen or woman should have her first pelvic exam:<br>  <br>      * You're 18 and have never had pelvic exam<br>      * You're 16 and haven't had your first period<br>      * You're having a problem - like painful periods or PMS<br>      * You've been having periods for 1 or 2 years, but still aren't seeing regular patterns<br>      * You have irregular periods or have missed more than three periods<br>      * You have vaginal itching, redness, sores, swelling, or unusual odor<br>      * You have abnormal discharge - this is any vaginal discharge that differs in consistency, color, or quantity from what you normally see<br>      * You're flow is really heavy, unusual, or lasts more than 7 days (you have unusually heavy flow if you go through a super plus tampon or super pad in less than one hour)|`|7j2Sb892aa	I feel sorry for you. you will get a pap smear.

AA11309717	have you been diagnosed by a physician or is this a self diagnosis? If you've been diagnosed by a physician he/she should have given you a script for meds for your assortment of conditions. My guess is that if you have meds you take them on a regular basis that will help with the motivation for your schoolwork and your organization. If you are self diagnosing then your next step should be going to the doctor to either confirm what you already believe or to find out what really is wrong with you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

eRX96A73aa	I have the same thing except for my ringing is constant. I can't really hear it unless the room is completely quiet or when I cup my ears with my hand. It is in my right ear and when I went to the doctor he diagnosed me with Tinnitus. <br>  It is just a term for people who suffer from ear noises. Some people hear 'cracks' or 'pops', but most people have the ringing. It can be cause by many different things. A lot of people get it from years and years of listening to the music too loud, and some people just get it just because. <br>  I have ringing in my ears because of my Thyroid problem. The imbalance of hormones causes the constant ringing in my ears. <br>  The ringing can get louder or can have a 'flare up' when you get sick or when you get an allergy attack. It's a pretty common disease.<br>  But! you may not even have this disease, you may just be getting a head cold that is causing the pressure and ringing in your ears, but if you have the ringing for a long time (a few months) or have had it for a long time, then you probably do have Tinnitus. <br>  Check out this website and it will give you more information.<br>  It's not really harmful to have this disease it is just more annoying than anything else! <br>  Good luck, hope this helped!!|`|2JTBPhuuaa	I get that once in a while.

But i have a friend and she told me like this superstition or whatever and when you hear that it means that some1 is taking bad about you but I don't think it's true so don't worry about it being that.|`|CN0cLscZaa	Any type of ringing or sound in the ears that doesn't come from an outside source is called Tinnitus. There are a number of things that can cause tinnitus, but hearing loss is the most common. If you want to know how to deal with your Tinnitus, I would suggest that you go to your doctor and ask him for a referral to see an otolaryngologist (aka Ears Nose and Throat Specialist (or ENT)), obviously it would be best if the ENT specialized in tinnitus. ENT's that don't specialize in tinnitus can't really help you (trust me I know). And you should see an audiologist to have a really good hearing test done. The information that the ENT and audiologist gives you will help you determine what is causing your tinnitus, and whether or not it is treatable.Tinnitus is not the actual problem, it is a symptom. If you want to treat the tinnitus, you have to treat the cause.<br>  <br>  The causes of tinnitus are ear infections, Meniere's Disease, aging (aka Presbycusis) some fluid in the ears, some medications, acoustic trauma (such as from the noise of planes, firearms, or loud music), sometimes but rarely a benign tumor on the acoustic nerve can cause it.<br>  <br>  Also, doctors really don't know why you hear the ringing sound. A new common theory is that it is all in your head. If you have dead hearing cells, your brain doesn't know how to deal with the absence of the signal, so it creates it's own sound. It is much like phantom limb syndrome, an amputee might feel pain from nerve endings that were on limbs that were amputated. Your brain doesn't know what to do when it's not receiving signals from nerve endings in the ear, and it assumes that there must be a sound, so it creates the sound.<br>  <br>  In the mean time, you might want to try using white noise. I find that it is soothing and drowns out the ringing in my ears. You can go here, <a href="http://www.simplynoise.com/," rel="nofollow">http://www.simplynoise.com/,</a> and download some free white noise mp3's. They really help.<br>  <br>  I have a bad case of tinnitus and I can hear it 24/7. My tinnitus was caused by noise induced hearing loss and there is no cure for it. I would highly urge everyone to visit my blog, <a href="http://mylifewithtinnitus.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mylifewithtinnitus.blogspot.com/</a> , it may help a few people.|`|rj57MKHYaa	well it happens when you have broken or disrupted your eardrums with a loud noise.<br>  <br>  if you put your ear up to the wasin machine and hit it with a coin ull hear ringing anyware from 5min to forever. its not smart to do it... lol...<br>  <br>  id go to the doctor if i was you.|`|0z45q8UWaa	Tinnitus<br>  <br>  More info in source|`|hJU59dAJaa	maybe from listening to too loud of music|`|vMByDy1raa	There is a medical condition that people have ringing in their ears and it can be corrected.

FVDbVcnCaa	I wouldn't say there is such thing as a "average" size... because every man is different.

When they then heard about weight loss in association with hypnosis they usually asked themselves 'How exactly does hypnosis for weight loss work'? It's no secret that many successful people such as top mangers or top athletes make use of this method in order to optimize their behavior. But does hypnosis for weight loss work equally well? Let us discuss the basics of hypnosis and see if it could also be helpful in terms of losing weight.<br>   <br>   <br>    Hypnosis has long been a matter of debate. Some people believe in hypnosis, usually because they have read about this method or because they actively make use of it and obtain positive results. Other people are skeptical and don't believe in hypnosis, mostly because they have not yet occupied themselves with the matter. Hypnosis has nothing to do with magic and simply works by conditioning your subconscious. By giving your subconscious instructions you can change your habits for the better. It's not as complicated as most people think; you will just have to learn to communicate with your mind on a subliminal level. That's it! Now that we have covered the functionality of hypnosis let us get more into detail about weight loss.<br>   <br>   <br>   How exactly does hypnosis for weight loss work? Basically you will just have to apply hypnosis in the above-mentioned way by providing your subconscious with the desired instructions. First, you should analyze your weak spots when it comes to your eating habits. Let us assume that you drink a lot of lemonade which contains a lot of simple sugar. In order to avoid the increased intake of lemonade you will have to give your subconscious adequate instructions. This will help you to dramatically change your behavior for the better.<br>   <br>   Does hypnosis for weight loss work in general? Hypnosis has been used as an effective method to modify peoples' behavior and help them to manage their overweight status. Several studies demonstrate a significant effect of hypnosis on the management of weight loss. The American Society of Clinical Hypnosis (ASCH) is the largest U.S. organization dealing with health and mental health care. They make use of the art of clinical hypnosis and have carried out a nine-week program of hypnosis for weight loss purposes. The bottom line of this study was that people who had been hypnotized achieved better results than people who had not been hypnotized.<br>   <br>   Another study showed other positive results of hypnosis. In this study 60 women were categorized into two different groups, a hypnosis-group and a non-hypnosis-group. The hypnosis-group with? ? of 17 pounds compared to the non-hypnosis-group who only achieved a weight loss of 5 pounds. In this way they have proven the question does hypnosis for weight loss work in general beyond any doubt.<br>   <br>   Hypnosis is definitely a very effective way to get rid of extra pounds. With the right how-to-do information you can be the one who can provide your subconscious with the adequate instructions and, thus, easily change your behavior for the better.<br>   By: Oliver Hetzel<br>   Article Directory: <a href="http://www.articledashboard.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.articledashboard.com</a><br>                                                                Self Hypnosis For Weight Loss: Stop From Eating When You're Not Hungry                                                         <br>                                                            Just think of how many clothes...???Read more...<br>  <br>                                                                Hypnosis Weight Loss: Some Ways To Stop The Weighting | Hypnosis ...                                                         <br>                                                            No body likes to count calorie...???Read more...<br>  <br>                                                                Diabetic Diet Hypnosis Download                                                         <br>                                                            Download Stick to your Diabeti...???Read more...<br>  <br>                                                                Carbohydrate And Low And Diet                                                         <br>                                                            Is hypnosis process doe...???Read more...<br>  <br>                                                                Hypnosis for weight loss | ADHD Is A Gift                                                         <br>                                                            Hypnosis is extremely e...???Read more...<br>  <br>    Does Hypnosis For Weight Loss Work?

YIs51Vp8aa	The last part of your question is why it is so popular!  IT DOES WORK!!<br>  The workouts are very effective.  It is like having a bootcamp and trainer right in your home.  it is the complete package.  You get the workouts and 90 day plan, meal plans, support and variety.<br>  <br>  Believe the results you see in ads and on TV  this is the real deal!<br>  <br>  As far as what it is:<br>  P90X is a great program that will really get you results! It is an advanced program so be prepared for that. Some people start with Power 90 or the Power90 Master series first and work up to P90X.<br>  <br>   The program is excellent and does really work!<br>  <br>  The Workouts are about an hour long and there are 12 of them. They alternate days of resistance training and cardio. Each resistance day includes the Ab workout as well. The workouts are broken out by body part (like Chest and Back, Shoulders,Biceps and triceps etc.)<br>  <br>  You can select from 3 eating plans and 3 workout plans depending on your goals. <br>  <br>  It is a full fitness solution and you will see results and not be bored at all.  It is like working out with a personal trainer everyday.  In fact several of the trainers at my gym use the program and the exercises from it with their clients!

If you are working out every day you should be taking in well over 2000. Also look at how long you've been working out. If you have just started recently, your body is busy building muscle. Thus you may lose weight slowly or actually gain weight for a short time, since muscle weighs more than fat. <br>  <br>  Also, beware of eating name brnad health foods like TV dinners that come in boxes.

4w5kDz9daa	Depression strikes many people at some point or another in their lives. The persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, anxiety about the future, loss of energy, loss or enjoyment in activities, and changes in appetite and sleep patterns can rob us of joy, fulfillment, and productivity. Fortunately, many cases of depression can be managed through natural means. While there may be severe cases in which pharmaceutical approaches are required, in many milder instances, using a natural method like an exercise program can be very effective in reducing symptoms and elevating mood. While exercise may sound distinctly unappealing when you don't want to get out of your bed, keep in mind that as you feel better, exercise will become much easier.

They'll get better.<br>  <br>  If your depression is bad enough, you should seek help, however just making some changes in your lifestyle may help if it's mild and temporary.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your weight may be causing some of the problems.  You don't have to go to the gym to work out.  Take a brief walk, put on some music and just dance around crazy.  Find something you enjoy to do that makes you move, even if it's less exercise than you were doing before.  Just do something.<br>  <br>  Cutting chocolate out of your diet will, but don't deprive yourself.  Splurge sometimes and eat some chocolate, and have a smaller dinner.  Obviously, you can't do this all of the time because chocolate doesn't have the nutrients that regular food does, but it will make you feel better when you have a craving.  The only thing that really matters when trying to lose weight is the total amount of calories you are eating.  The less you eat, the more weight you will lose.  So one chocolate you don't eat is maybe 100 calories less you ate that day.  One chocolate does matter!
5KAreKDjaa	Apparently no one's heard of kilograms lol<br>  I'd say 55kg is a healthy weight, not sure what the average weight is but I suspect a lot more than that|`|N1jDiLSBaa	The pattern for losing weight is easy - consume less and exercise more often - the difficulties surface when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are a lot of opportunities to fail in the real world aren't there?! The one method that clearly worked for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I melted away 25 pounds, it clearly does produce success!|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	125 - 140|`|TPTpwarwaa	It all depends what your body frame is, or anyones really.. but when i was 16 (i'm 20 now) i was 5'9 and i weighed 125-130, which i have a medium build body i suppose-wore about a size 5
Ks1uiHReaa	ugh I had BV once and that was the most discusting smell ever. I think if you had it again, you would know.I most certinaly would.If your nervous just make an appt with the doctor! cant hurt, right??? good luck ;)|`|AA12227599	Sounds like a Bacterial Infection. There is a cream for that but I can't remember what it's called. See if your GYN can call it in for you.<br>  It is definitely NOT a yeast infection unless you are extremely itchy, and over the counter meds will not get rid of it.|`|4lQ5AuUcaa	Its sounds like the clap. Stop sleeping with strangers every day.|`|bdiSM1UXaa	Oops. That sounds like a yeast infection. Usually, when doctors prescribe medications such as "Flagyl" to treat BV, they are fully aware that most often than not this particular drug ends up causing the person to have a yeast infection. If you're really unlucky, Flagyl won't treat your BV and cause a yeast infection on top of it. <br>  <br>    From what you wrote, however, it sounds like you have just a yeast infection which could be treated by over-the-counter drugs such as Monistat. If it is your first yeast infection, it's probably best to go back to your doctor.<br>  <br>     Cottage cheese like discharge coming close to your periods after you've been treated with BV,  very much sounds like a yeast infection. Contrary to popular opinion, unless it's your first yeast infection, you will not itch like crazy. I have friends that have it before every period and itch a little but not to the point where they complain about it. I myself had yeast infections where it was somewhat uncomfortable but I didn't even go to the doctor and just treated it with Monistat.<br>  <br>   Also, there are home test kits available otc for vaginal infections. It tells you whether you have a yeast or bacterial infection. Last time I purchased it, it cost about 10 dollars.|`|6hBKoN6Jaa	Sounds like a yeast infection.  Call the doctor right away.|`|MHQkgpdqaa	i have no clue ,<br>   call the doc and ask her. <br>  or get like cream for it ?<br>   vagisil or w.e ? :)

2861f4b38f22c59d4c2607ae117a9c58aa	If you start taking the pill you won't get your period. Just get some from a free clinic take them until your birthday and stop after your birthday. Your period will come after you stop taking them. <br>  <br>  I did this when I was going on a trip and I didn't want mine to come either. It works!|`|ON84EQaBaa	There's no way you have any control when you period comes, if it comes down on your b-day just make your plans on another day.|`|6hBKoN6Jaa	If perchance you do come on your period on your birthday, simply tell your boyfriend that he has to wait.|`|tGcNmDUZaa	You could go to the doctor and get some pills. But really, I would just tell him. If you want to "do it", try the shower. ;)<br>  <br>  A product which I have tried is Insteads, they are disposable menstrual cups, small things that sit inside and catch your flow and you can forget all about your period! You can also have sex with it in so it'll be like it isn't there! I love them.<br>  <br>  Check out the website in the "sources" part of my answer, buy a box and practise. You'll have it down by your birthday, have a great time!|`|mHSaUWv4aa	Nothing you can do that'll work forsure.<br>  Try working out alot this month....they say it slows your period down.<br>  If you do get it don't let it ruin your birthday<br>  tell him what the deal is....and make next week your belated birthday "party" :)|`|paCHaDWVaa	You can't stop your period. It's going to start whether you like it or not! That's one of the perks of being a female.|`|Z2YgGifCaa	There's probably not much you can do at this point, but are you on Birth Control pills by any chance?<br>  <br>  If so, my doctor told me once that I could skip the last week of pills, the sugar pills which usually start your period, and go straight on to the next pack. But every doctor will have a different opinion about this, so talk to yours before you do anything.<br>  <br>  If your not on BC pills, ask your doctor if Seasonique may be right for you. There are other variations of this pill, but that is the brand that I take and you only have a period every three months. I just started mine about a month and a half ago and I just now got the breakthrough bleeding, so it should buy you at least a month or so. But it might be worth talking to your doctor about.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and GOOD LUCK!|`|OtHl10gsaa	well drink alot of soda but first try to see if it stops it or makes it come faster cuz for me it stops it but comes back a day or 2 later depending on how much i drink|`|Ndj9ln7Iaa	If you dont want to be on for your birthday take tablets which will stop it.|`|IkgyyPtYaa	well dont be shy about it to him, let him now, and wear a few pairs of knickers ;D

But if u can't afford it go to your local Walgreen's or drugstore and talk to the pharmacy.  That's what i usually do when I don't really think I need a doctors opinion.  It sounds like your sinus is infected and it really doesn't matter how much OTC medicines you take you will definitely need some antibiotics!|`|JGN1Rk1iaa	sheesh people no need to get so attitudy... lol.... well i thinkthat u should just rest a lot... drink a lot of water... and dont go 2 work or school.. and maybe ur best off to go to a docter. but u dont need 2 go to the hospital thats a little over board + more money... so yeahh.. try that u should get better soon and hope u dooo! <br>  <br>  :] hope i helped yaaa|`|pIgSS5Nqaa	Why would you go to the hospital for that.

Don't go to work or school. Drink/eat fluids. Yeah eat your fluids! Like soup is great for you or bread and water is good. I would take a warm bath not too hot not too cold and get right into bad right after make sure your hair isn't wet though!<br>  <br>  If it goes on for more than 2 days, arrange it with a friend or a family member to take you to the doctor or have a doctor come to you!

dpgXzMenaa	Manual and oral sex - uhhh... that is, masturbating each other or going down on each other. <br>  <br>  If you're really into avoiding *contact* without avoiding sexual pleasure, masturbate together... you can each show the other what works best for you that way and each learn what sorts of touch the other likes, and both get a heck of an arousing show to make your own masturbating pleasure even better.|`|kYHOMU4Caa	<a href="http://www.alltopshoes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.alltopshoes.com</a>|`|3lYBFgqwaa	Theres no other way to say these things romantically but.. finger her or lick her out<br>  <br>  No intercourse needed :DD|`|0FXVTZf7aa	Why don't you two look at the website below and talk about it.  It points out all the premarital sex in the Bible that your church will never tell you about.  Then you can have a conversation about "turning up the heat".
Y5IUse1vaa	Good grieff, I remember it well. I had to ask my mum to get me some "Doctor White" pads.. I had already been using toilet roll and thought that it would cause a scene if I used all of it!!!  As it happened, the shops were shut and she had to ask my neighbour is she had any spare pads. I was totally mortified!!!!|`|tAcWksQYaa	Wow! That's cool! <br>  <br>  My mom was away at a VERY important meeting so I had to wait until she got home to tell her. But before I could tell her she herself went to the bathroom and saw that there was the wrapping of a pad in the trash. So she called me and before she even said anything I told her I got my period. That was 5 days ago. IDK if my dad even knows. I think she migh have told him...|`|w77mTzfEaa	It was REALLY embarrasing for me. <br>  <br>  My brother (11) and i were brushing our teeth, and i was sitting on the toilet, lid closed ofcourse, and my brother said : whats that?! And to my horror there was like a little spot of blood on my white knickers (i was wearing a skirt). i was daed embarrased!|`|apzX48W4aa	I didn't know what it was and I was freaking out about it. Then she told me what it was.  lol|`|3lYBFgqwaa	I said to my Mum, "Err Mum, I think ive started my periods.....-worried face-"<br>  She then got this massively proud look n her face and was like "omg youre a woman!" and then was all smiley and grabbed me into a hug and i cringed sooooooooooo badly<br>  My dad told me he loves me to bits however he never ever ever wants to hear abut that kinda stuff from me xD<br>  Cos he's too much of a "real man"  lmao =D<br>  Stupid guy.|`|yFJDkZANaa	I was about 12 i had been out shopping with my mum and sisters then i got home went upstairs to the toliet i looked at my knickers like a spotting i just told my mum she just smiled at me and gave me pads and told me to ask her if i want use tampons. Been having it for 6 years now and using tampons for 3. x|`|dpOJwPJbaa	It was really embarrassing, after I noticed the mess I ran straight to my parents with me trousers round my ankles.<br>  <br>  They then explained to me that boys don't have periods and that in fact that I had internal bleeding.|`|hJHJyUWPaa	i was so embarressed i didnt even tell her until about 4 months later whne there was now sanitary towels in the press! I was so embarressed even then and havent ever talked to her about it since. i first got it almost 11 years ago!|`|LMRaSXFeaa	my mom got home from work and i told her. then she told me i couldve stayed home from school if i told her in the morning.|`|4Pa8TnLeaa	i just said.. mum i started my period <br>  not the biggest event of my life really lol
sQu3LLqtaa	Your ideal weight would be 115 lbs so below 95 lbs or above 135 lbs could be regarded as underweight or overweight.<br>  <br>  You are borderline underweight but if you feel OK you are probably OK.  Some gym instructors actually tell people not to take too much notice of height weight tables.|`|5ZXAVeZVaa	As long as your eating healthy and exercising I don't think it could be considered underweight, depending on your age.
txkTyn0laa	Appointments are free there so is the pill. PP came into my school last year and gave us a week of lectures and how they work, so trust me, i know all about it|`|Lr3lZ4draa	PP is completely confidential, so even if you use the insurance, they wont know|`|fZgwb1rqaa	There is a probably a Central District Health or a South Central District Health or something like that where you live. I would recommend that place over Planned Parenthood because you can get b/c for free for sure. They base the cost of your birth control on your income, and if it's low enough they'll just ask for a donation. IF they happen to ask for a donation ask for an envelope & tell them you'll mail it in... <br>  <br>  District Health officers are ran by the government, whereas Planned Parenthood is a private company so they usually charge you if you're over 18.

NLAek2bJaa	First of all, horrible idea. Yes, no dentist will do that for you for several reasons. Once you do something like that to your teeth, it permanently stays that way. Your going to have trouble eating and probably bite your lip or gum tissue making you bleed all the time with sores all over your mouth. You would be cutting on enamel, so if you cut too much of it off, your getting down into the layer called Dentin, it is much more sensitive, it will be more painful the more you eat, especially drink. You will then be more prone to decay starting and if it does, it is closer to your pulp, or nerve of the tooth, and it can end up as a root canal... trust me its not worth it for a short term cool thing to do right now while Twilight is out. I like Twilight too, but dont ruin your teeth. And, if all that happens, it will cost you a butt load of money just to fix your teeth. Again, not worth your time. Especially, when you get older, your going to wonder why you shaved your teeth down to points when they will not go back to normal.|`|RzWNjUgraa	operating on your teeth yourself will never be safe at all. you must be extremely careful. i actually tried it and unfortunately it didnt exactly come out how i wanted it too. i can also promise u that no dentist will agree to that. if u were to use a nail file i suggest u use one thats not so sharp or u may end up cutting your mouth. that would not be fun. i'd say before u try this find someone to spot u if u kno what i mean. be careful and good luck.
OsT64mqMaa	Alright, well you aren't going to lose weight JUST by changing your diet, you also have to be active. If you have the money and the time, I would try getting into a gym, or even using the Wii Fit, it works great, and has many different types of workouts.<br>  <br>  As for the food, it doesn't really matter WHAT you eat, as long as it's not incredibly unhealthy. A good way to tell is to count calories. You should normally intake 2000 a day for a good diet.|`|RVe1sN09aa	Exercise is the key! Go on a website like calorieking.com and look up calorie intake of certain foods. Then look up how many calories you should be taking a day (this is determined by age, gender, weight, and if you want to lose weight) - there are lots of tests online.<br>  <br>  Then combined with all this info, each day only consume up to that limit of calories. On top of that, 30 minutes a day on a exercise bike will make you lose probably about 1kg a week.|`|f4ef8ccd6e715f516bc37db8d8ec64f9aa	Everyone's always looking for a quick fix, but the best way to lose weight is the kind you've described. Eating healthier foods and exercising is the smartest way to lose weight and it also makes you healthier, stronger, and establishes a maintainable lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Try to make each meal contain at least one protein, one starch, and one fruit or vegetable. For instance, breakfast can be cereal and peanut butter on celery or an apple. Lunch can be a simple lunch meat (lean turkey or ham, not bologna, hotdogs, etc.) sandwich on whole wheat bread (which tastes better than white IMO) and a fruit or veggie. Dinner can be chicken, fish, or steak with a baked sweet potato and broccoli. <br>  <br>  And though this sounds like a stiff diet, remember you can eat more than this. Just make this your foundation and you're less likely to fill in those hunger gaps with junk food. Great snacks can be anything from pistachios to dried fruits, eda mame or pudding snacks, even yogurt (I swear by the Yoplait Lemon Meringue and Key Lime Pie Whips).<br>  <br>  Compliment this by exercising. Cardio's great for burning fat, and I've found that doing the elliptical 30-45 minutes a day can get my heart rate up and make me feel great. If you're more outdoorsy, try walking/jogging, canoeing, rock climbing, or skating. Just find a way to get active. Grabbing a buddy is also a great way to make sure you don't renege on your workout plans and have a good time.<br>  <br>  Remember, the simple rule for losing weight is to consume fewer calories than you expend. Eating sensibly and leading an active lifestyle mean that you're doing it right.|`|1f20f1da208219dd5783e152b06f05abaa	A protein shake for breakfast, a protein shake for lunch, a small dinner, no snacking, no eating after 5 pm, and Tae Bo 5 times a week.  I lost 70 lbs. in 6 months.|`|WBv2vD4haa	eat breackfast like a king<br>  Lunch like a Peasent<br>  dinner like a Poor Person<br>  <br>  walking helps you loose weight in all areas|`|p8HOUxNVaa	make sure to eat a filling breakfast and try foods with fiber they help your digestive system and keep you full longer
ZjhQ6PL8aa	If you had a peanut allergy you certainly wouldn't keep eating peanuts now would you?  While you definitely can go to the doctor, keep in mind if you go he's probably just gonna tell you to only drink things that don't cause this reaction.|`|h0ypk4Dtaa	Sounds like you are sensitive to caffeine. Try drinking a caffeine-free soda and see if you have the same symptoms. This is pretty common, as soda has large amounts of caffeine, some types more than others.
LGdwi71Qaa	ok not!!!!!! not having sex is the best protection condoms are the only thing that will protect you from sexually transmitted diseases other than not having sex at all.|`|Q5qpMLOVaa	Are you really going to take anything off Family Guy as something serious ?<br>  <br>  There's no other "items". None. Zero.|`|aXnVFFUkaa	a bin bag?|`|XcRxiJUcaa	I don't know how old you are but you can NOT use a trash bag.<br>  I'm pretty sure that if you want to protect yourself from getting preggers, a condom or birth control is the safest bet. <br>  <br>  I'm still laughing at this question. It's kinda like in Knocked Up when they say if the girl is on top she can't get pregnant because of gravity. Totally wrong.|`|t3Zuec0taa	Try a sandwich bag...but the fold-over kind, not the kind with the zipper. The zipper might hurt after a while.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	You could shove a nail in the hole of his thing..lol|`|avaQoSORaa	u could pull it out and stick it in her mouth
HXpR2bw0aa	Sorry hun, but I used to be a 36D and I have recently lost just over a stone. I now still wear my 36D cups, but I often wear my old C cups, because they fit again!<br>  <br>  But don't worry, because it's good. I mean, if you lost loads of weight, but your boobs stayed big, then you'd look weird... So its a good thing!<br>  <br>  But I know how you feel...   :(|`|wzAhxdpKaa	It cannot be done.  If you lose 20 pounds with tea or any weight loss method.  Weight will come off all over your body in the same proportions it was added as you gained.  There is NO way around that.  The only solution that can help reduce in only certain areas is liposuction or plastic surgery.
YDr8EO5Taa	Only if it's hungry.|`|ReFjTVBCaa	Probably not, your cat would have to lick it up. Cats can't actually drink anyway, and if it's throwing up then why would you want it to drink something.

7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	it could have been something as simple as a pimple.<br>  <br>  I have had these on my vulva - very painful but disappear without trace after a few days.<br>  <br>  <br>  I wouldn't be too concerned, but mention it to your Dr at your next regular check up.|`|iNniJqgfaa	Go check it out, it may not be cancer but it may be something else, check it out in case|`|YLe6j6t4aa	That bump is a sign of herpes you might have gotten it while using a public rest room|`|cftWwsidaa	yes i would check it out i dont think it is i hope it isnt
ZA0yDMLvaa	thats only going to happen for the first few days. thats because your body is not used to the meat in your body and has turned of all the meat digestive systems in your body, thats why. feel better though.|`|1GUtq3Cnaa	Here's a recollection of mine from a while ago, so it might be a little off.<br>  My science teacher said that once he was in Germany. He didn't read a label on a sausage because he probably didn't want to take the effort in translation. It said that the meat needed to be cooked, but he ate it raw. He also ate chocolate with it, causing the brain to THINK that chocolate was poisonous! I think he said it went away after a little while of that re-training his nervous system. So the point is, you probably have spent so long believing that meat is bad for you that your not conscious mind caused a slight allergic reaction. If you keep eating meat it should go away in a few days, maybe, if I'm right.|`|ch8DC4z7aa	Sometimes the mind plays tricks on us. Maybe it's because you ate the meat as you had to rather than because you wanted to, your mind was telling you that you don't like it and so you were sick. A sort of placebo.<br>  <br>  I don't eat eggs. I'm not allergic and its not necessarily the taste, I eat things with eggs in  them such as cakes or meringues (as long as I can't smell the eggs in them) but if I eat a flan or my tongue even touches a boiled egg I throw up and feel ill for days.<br>  <br>  You said you only ate it once right? Just try again with a different meat or something that is covered in a lot of marinade or vegetables that you like and see how you feel|`|ApG0DpzXaa	I'm going to presume the chicken was fresh, and well cooked, etc.. and that this not a food handling issue.<br>  <br>  This is probably a mostly psychological reaction.  All kinds of emotions and personal values and conflicts are tied up to the act of changing your personal identification from vegetarian to "mostlytarian".<br>  <br>  These (valid) issues are making you feel ill.<br>  <br>  Just for the devil's advocate of it, I know that unfamiliar types of protien have made people sick in the past, (An orthodox raised Jew who became notably less orthodox tossed his cookies the first time in his life that he ate pork), but this also may have had a psychological component.
aXnVFFUkaa	i used the weight watchers point system<br>  i found i very easy to follow<br>  <br>  i lost up to 4 pounds a week and all together lost 2 stone|`|BlMNm9Ccaa	Not familiar with Herbal Magic.

gWlmU1KJaa	yes, mention it!<br>  <br>  it might just be a leakly filling, it happens a lot!<br>  <br>  they can do a root canal, it isnt painfull as the meds work, BUT its uncomfortable with your mouth open for ages as they work|`|cYtPfXkJaa	If you're concerned about it, it's best that you have someone look at it. It could just be a sensitive tooth, but if there is a leaky filling it's much better that you get it sorted early. That way it will just need a replacement filling and not a root canal. As you don't mention any pain, it seems unlikely that it will need a root canal, but even if it does don't panic, I'm 21 and had my first one a few weeks ago and it was painless. Don't listen to the horror stories - dental procedures have moved on in the past few years!<br>  <br>  Hope it gets sorted out for you. Nothing worse than tooth pain x|`|Jgzf2Pbeaa	my aunt had that same thing and she told her dentist so they did a root canal (or how ever you spell it) it did not hurt unless she ate|`|FYnCohXYaa	YESS<br>  or it can't get worst and more painful<br>  i had that, it didn't hurt as much as i thought it would|`|aMELFGh0aa	It would be a good idea to tell your dentist. In the meantime you might try Sensodyne or it's generic equivalent. It's made for sensitive teeth.

If the problem gets worse, go straight to casualty as you may have an infection.<br>  <br>  NHS direct can also find emergency dentists if you contact them, assuming your own dentist isn't able to fit you in.|`|USCQxtn5aa	eat soup through a straw <br>  <br>  thats not good if you cant eat properly see a gp or dentist|`|iynxbd9Daa	go to the dentist|`|1Jz21wyLaa	You probably have temporalmandibular joint disorder - TMJ dysfunction for short, basically a sore jaw joint!<br>  <br>  A dentist can construct a splint for you to wear at night to correct the way your jaw sits.  In the meantime, stick to a soft diet, take painkillers and apply heat to the affected area to help relieve the pain.  The best painkillers would be paracetamol, ibuprofen or prescription medications Nortriptyline or Amitriptyline.  Also, ask your dentist or GP to refer you to your local hospital's Oral Maxillo-Facial department in order to have this assessed further.<br>  <br>  I suffer from this myself and it's horrible but if its any consolation its fairly common and easily managed with the right tactics.  Hope you feel better soon!

zIyC4Jumaa	I started taking it when i was 16<br>  started taking it for contraception, but also for irregular periods<br>  Its more affective for contraception than condoms, 99% effective against pregnancies, however no protection over STDs. <br>  Pros: easy, effective, no uncomfortableness from condoms lol, no faffing about you get when putting condoms on or anything like that, regulate ur periods so you know exactly when ur gonna come on, and if thats inconvenient you can carry the pill on to control your periods to suit your needs<br>  Cons: I sometimes forget to take it, although you can just take it later in the day, but it is reccomended to take it around the same time every day. doesnt protect from STDs so you do have to use condoms if you may be at risk.<br>  anyway i hope this helps :)|`|RWiom35vaa	loestrin 20 at 17 years old and now i'm 23. best pill for me. it lightens my periods to virtually nothing and i've not had nay side effects. no complaints here!|`|DfABElERaa	I started using it when I was 17, it has never given me any problems at all!

Z2YgGifCaa	I also have problems with ovarian cysts and what you described is exactly what I go through. However, I also have endometriosis, which can also be extremely painful. Has your doctor ever checked to see if you might also suffer from Endometriosis?<br>  <br>  If it were me, I would make an appointment with an Ob/Gyn and talk to him/her about your symptoms because while it does sound to me like its ovarian cysts, there are multiple other issues which could also be going on and it is always better to be safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  Also, you might want to consider getting on some form of birth control, unless you are currently trying to get pregnant because it can stop the ovulation which is often times what causes the cysts to begin with. I know before I was put on BC pills I was in pain two or three weeks out of the month, now there's nothing other than the occasional cramping, so it is worth considering. Either way talk to your doctor as soon as possible just to eliminate any other possible concerns.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and GOOD LUCK!|`|paCHaDWVaa	It is quit possible, I had some ovarian cysts. My body gave me all the symptoms of a pregnancy, so if your in pain I would go to the doctor.|`|9ZTYDMNPaa	Cysts come and go every month.  It's the bodies natural way to take care of itself.  My doc said you get small cysts around the time of your monthly cycle.  It could mean you have another hugh cyst and it hasn't burst yet.  You may want to contact your doc, birth control pills help control cysts from becoming large and burst.  Endometrosis is another problem that it sounds like.  Call the doctor.  I've always had problems growing up,  had several surgeries for and endometrosis.  Take care of yourself and Good Luck at you dr. visit.|`|5GPDrBPLaa	I have small ovarian cysts.  I feel the sharp pain on my lower left side.  Some days I can barely walk...I'm literally limping because it hurts so bad.  I do get bloated, but I've never felt nauseated.  Then again, mine are small, so I'm sure if yours is bigger, it could cause that.<br>  <br>  Talked to my doc about it and he has me taking BC pills constantly (no placebo) to keep me from ovulating.  This has helped tremendously...no pain.<br>  <br>  If it hurts that bad, I'd call your gynecologist.  They can do an ultrasound to see how bad it is and if it needs followup.  Good luck...I feel your pain...literally.

r4xRkqzdaa	okay, the vagina is INSIDE the body... there's no possibility of it 'sagging' outside of the body.<br>  <br>  what you see on the outside is called labia.  for some women, it is normal to hang down a little bit.  labia is latin for lip... so they are basically a bigger and a weirder version of a lip.  some women even have to have surgury to cut down their labia because they hang down so low and cause a lot of pain (however not very common)<br>  <br>  the only thing that can make your VJ 'looser' is pregnancy, but that's not too much.  your vagina can still hold in a tiny tampon so there is not reason to think that you are 'stretched out' or anything like that<br>  <br>  trust me, every VJ is different and looks different on the outside for everyone and guys love that they are different.  15 is too young for a sexual relationship with a boy, but trust me, when it's time he'll love it and won't think that it looks stupid

5wcgYT8uaa	i hate having periods on holiday :@ it's so annoying<br>  <br>  basically your period occurs every 28 to 30 days or something like that<br>  so get a calender and count forward 28 days from when your peiod started so that will give you a rought idea<br>  hope this helps :)|`|0OB7yAFwaa	Since you only just started your period this month then I don't think you will get it in March. After all, your period is highly irregular when you have only just begun. I would suggest that you count 28-32 days from the 5th of February to see when you are next expecting it. If that is before your vacation then that's great. However, I would suggest that you bring a whole bunch of supplies with you just in case. I really hope that helps you out, and have a great vacation :)|`|G2UxkIJJaa	well it depends really but before i get mine a few days before i sometimes get stomach aches and you mite just feel under the weather you mite be able to tell through some symptoms you get a few days before but if not then just take some spare pads or tampons and if it doesnt happen then thats good but if it does then just get on with your holiday it shouldnt stop you good luck hope this helps x|`|kXVagSmbaa	well, my boobs usually get bigger [like swell up, but not actully swell] haha. or else you start to break out, like my friend. but if your stressed out then you mostlikly will miss it. yeah my birthday is march 17th and i hope i don't start then, it will suck:/|`|rAcHFUvyaa	You could have gone on the Pill but it's probably too late now as the Pill is generally started sometime during your period...you would *probably* get your period sometime between the 1st-5th of March, if not it will be slightly earlier or slightly later.|`|6TFrcaoyaa	i didnt get mine again till like 2 months later, but i wouldnt know how it would be with you. i would say just bring pads with you so you dont have any trouble. dont count on not having it.|`|K5Wr8Mcaaa	I heard that a women's cycle is suppose to run every 28 days.

f8mLpPXlaa	To lose someone you care about, even temporarily, leaves a hole in your heart. This is a saying because sometimes it really does feel like there's something missing. It's really an emptiness in your soul. You'll be coming across that feeling a lot in your life. We all do. And we each deal with it in our own way. So there's really no point in telling you to do this or that because you have to find your own path. You are a unique individual and while you are a child you try different things, experiment but some day you'll realize that you can handle any situation. Be happy now that it's only temporary separation but learn from it.<br>  Know that everthing that happens to you in life is teaching you something. Be open minded enough to see the lesson in everything.|`|DBUmR8FTaa	This is normal when someone you care a lot about is gone. You miss them. It is ok to have a empty feeling. Can you still communicate with them? They would not want you to not eat. I understand when you are upset you have no appetite and everything seem to taste like card board. You have to stay busy. Think about it like this how sweet it will be when they come back. Start thinking about planning a party. It will give you something to do and something to look forward to. I know it is hard but parting and getting together is a part of life we all have to go thru.It makes us appreciate our loved ones so much more when they return. Go out with your friends and keep your chin up.That choked up feeling that you have that you can't eat and that hole in your heart will be heal it will be ok they will return.|`|qeSXDEMZaa	To "have a hole in your chest/your heart" means you feel like a piece of you is missing. Generally people use the phrase "a hole in my heart" meaning, now since they are gone; that piece of your heart that you had for that person is now empty. It is a sign of affection for someone and a very nice thing to say to someone to show you care. Hope this helps.|`|lophd4T4aa	I'm no doctor but I am a student of bio-medicine and psychology so to the best of my knowledge it seems to be depression and this is normal considering your situation. In time this will most likely pass. If not my suggestion would be to seek aid from a licensed Psychologist. <br>  <br>  Hope I helped you out. Remember, you aren't alone and if you want it to be, in time, things will be ok. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|baSRQUiPaa	it means that someone you really love like a mom or dad has left for a while and you feel like you have a whole in your chest is because you miss him very much and want them back when your father comes back you wont feel it anymore
q4WcyJ6Laa	That shampoo is a waste of money. Your friend can't fake that one.|`|13k2WKx8aa	No. There is absolutely no way to cheat it. The only way to cheat it is to shave your head. The test works like rings in a tree.<br>  <br>  What they're measuring is the densities in the hair's structure. If they wanted to, they could do the same with your fingernails. They way out of the fingernail test would be to remove all finger and toenails.<br>  <br>  The shampoo is total bullshit. Don't waste your money.<br>  <br>  Side advice: If you know your going to get tested or potential to get tested, why do drugs in the first place? I suppose an inability to reject or turn them down would denote some form of dependence or addiction. Eh, what do I know.|`|2cnSGnyHaa	theyre f*cked.<br>  trust me, <br>  there is absolutely zero way to cheat on those.<br>  im sorry :(

9EVcTnUWaa	You don't say how old you are but you're not old enough to have done everything.  I'm 54 and I haven't done everything and my 85 year old parents haven't done everything. You have to figure out why you're bored and what you want to do with your life.  Since you don't say how old you are its kind of hard to suggest something.  But the easiest way to get rid of boredom is to look out side of ourselves and help others.  Figure out where you are in life and where you want to be in 6 months a year, 3 years and 5 years and do what has to be done to get there.  IF you mean that you're bored at this particular moment and can't get to some place to buy a new, book or music or what ever it is you like than go into the kitchen and fix yourself something to eat using what's in the fridge and make some thing you've never had before.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	A good long RPG or action-adventure could help pass the time.

I dunno, don't worry about that though. Don't start verbally abusing people though or suck it in. You're better then that. I'm sure you're great and once you find some great friends and get comfortable with yourself you won't care anymore. People really don't care about that kind of stuff when you reach high school or the "real world."

yE2vM76naa	Its largely genetic (which oddly as it sounds, is NOT to be confused with hereditary fructose intolerance - which is a liver problem, not an intestinal issue)...<br>  <br>  I actually suspect that its the other way around, that the intestinal condition makes you predisposed to other opportunistic infections, yeast being one of them...|`|mTSYemNgaa	Use "Mega Flora" to replace the "friendly bacteria" in your  intestines to clear up candida. I used to have systemic candida and I take 2 Mega Flora a day and I don't have a problem with it anymore.|`|8e5f9cb1082d891d0f3075f0e2e92d34aa	Candida (Yeast) can cause many problems if it takes control. It can cause alot of digestive problems, and some even think that there could be a link between candida and mental illnesses such as depression. This yeast (Like all fungus) produces toxins. These toxins are actually what causes the symptoms. Think of it like a psychodelic Mushroom. Mushrooms, yeast, fungus, are all related. So anytime you have a fungal infection of any kind, it can cause all sorts of mental and physical symptoms. I would not at all be suprised if Candida can cause fructose intolerance.

uVMlNvLoaa	Hun, if you don't wipe them out with antibiotics, it's just going to keep coming back. UTI's are not to be taken lightly! I ignored mine one time and almost ended up in the hospital with a kidney infection--you certainly can't afford that! Go to a clinic somewhere, or try and get an appt with your doctor--I know your budget's tight, but with health you really can't cut corners.<br>  <br>  If you start getting cramp-like pains or stabbing pains in your lower back, get a severe headache, or throw up, get to your doctor or ER asap. That's the signs of a kidney infection, which can shut down your entire system if you don't take care of it.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Don't ignore this because of tight money. If you don't cure it properly, it's going to get a LOT more expensive very quickly.<br>  <br>  Do what you have to do, to get it examined and get some antibiotics.

ERnZPKTlaa	Shin splints are not easy to get rid of, and even if it's in your right leg it could be due to the dominance and amount of usage on that leg. I suggest if when you stretch the calf try to angle your foot or leg so that you feel the pull where it hurts, just do that twice a day and it should diminish the pain. Before stretching, you can apply a heat pack, and then after stretching, apply an ice pack. Hopefully that will do it.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)
oKg42gQMaa	Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a heart rhythm disorder that can potentially cause fast, chaotic heartbeats. The rapid heartbeats, caused by changes in the part of your heart that causes it to beat, may lead to fainting. In some cases, your heart's rhythm may beat so erratically that it can cause sudden death. <br>  <br>  You can be born with a genetic mutation that puts you at risk of long QT syndrome. In addition, more than 50 medications, many of them common, may cause long QT syndrome. Medical conditions, such as congenital heart defects, also may cause long QT syndrome. <br>  <br>  Long QT syndrome is treatable. You may need to limit your physical activity, avoid certain medications that can cause the condition or take medications to prevent a chaotic heart rhythm (arrhythmia). Some people with long QT syndrome also need an implantable device to control the heart's rhythm and to prevent against sudden death.|`|llEdx8Q2aa	<a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/long-qt-syndrome/DS00434" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/long-qt...</a><br>  <br>  I think that should help you :D|`|YvjPePdIaa	yes my mom died of it and i have it along with other family members<br>  <br>  I’m trying to keep this simple and easy to understand because it is very complicated. So as you know, your heart is what keeps you alive. But, what you might not know is that your heart’s rhythm is energized by electricity and when this is not normal, it can lead your heart to have chaotic rhythms which can potentially cause your heart to fail. This is what happens when you have Pro-Long QT Syndrome or LQTS. <br>  <br>  so basically when you have a arrhythmia or chaotic heart beat for whatever reason when it is sped up exercise, caffeine, etc. it becomes too chaotic and is too inefficient and stops beating causing you to die,faint,etc.<br>  <br>  check out longqt.org
GykweMSfaa	I think you have to describe  more a specific situation , if you want any relevant answers
f8mLpPXlaa	The endoscopy you're probably referring to is a flexible tube they put down your throat and look around at your esophagus, stomach and such. I've had it done down my  throat, into my lungs and up you know where. every time the worst thing was having them start the intravenous. Once they have that they give you some medicine that when you wake up you'll ask them when they're going to start. You won't feel a thing, guaranteed.<br>  God bless and help you through this and make you well again.|`|lophd4T4aa	now an endoscopy is a very minimally invasive procedure. And aside from minor temporary discomfort there should be no pain. A mild (usually conscious) aesthetic is usually given depending on the procedure. A tube is inserted rectally or orally (depending on the location of the problem area that needs to be seen) and the tube is gently fed in until the area is reached. A camera on the tube allows the visualisation of the problem area and then the tube is removed and the procedure is finished. It is a very routine procedure and you have nothing to worry about. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps|`|bh8BrwrLaa	hi,<br>  Yes i had one done. Don't be scared as you won't feel any real pain. You may feel a little discomfort as a small tube was sent down your throat to your stomach. They give you a mild sedative so you don't rememeber a thing after the procedure is done. I was quite nervous also but it was really ok. So good luck!
BTI0XOptaa	No, there is no reason to be afraid. Head lice only transfer through physical contact, they do not jump or fly as is sometimes believed. <br>  <br>  Adults and nymphs are only able to survive for 2-3 days off the host in optimal conditions.Under normal circumstances however this is more likely to be measured in hours rather than days as the adult louse is highly susceptible to dehydration and will quickly starve.Eggs can survive away from the host for up to 7 days but will not hatch without the warmth of a human host.<br>  <br>  Wash the inside of your car as a precaution, but a nit that falls out attached to a hair needs the warmth of the scalp to hatch. Without this, it will simply die. The chances of it finding its way back to that scalp are minimal.<br>  <br>  Do NOT shampoo with pesticides 'just in case.' The lice preparations you buy from a chemist are pesticides and every pesticide has the potential to do serious harm, even if used 100% as directed.<br>  <br>  You really don't have to worry too much about it until you find live lice in your hair. If you have an infestation, please see the following website for more articles and information.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|RXI8ImdIaa	lol<br>  <br>  <br>  No, don't worry about it just yet. If the co-worker herself ends up having lice, then maybe it's a slightly bigger issue for you.<br>  <br>  However adults in an office do not spread lice like kids at an elementary school do. I bet you're not braiding each others' hair, and sharing brushes, and putting your heads down together and so on.

But still if you were to stand with another person and lock your lips together and breathe each others breath you're still breathing through your nose. Any way, let's just say you could find a way to breathe each others breath there are mechanisms in your body that would, even in the most dedicated effort cause you to pass out and start breathing naturally again.<br>  Wow! Sometimes I wonder how much misinformation is out there.<br>  Don't believe everything you hear my friend.|`|30auhBwDaa	You cannot breath carbon dioxide because your body only inhales oxygen or O2. Carbon dioxide CO2 is not in hales because the bond between the C and the O2 cannot be broken. On could run out of oxygen which will cause hypoxia or low oxygen level.

If it does I would probably see a doctor, get an x-ray.<br>  If it hurts to breath and even touch ( assuming thats semi- lightly) then there is a good chance that it is broken.  You can check WebMd or a site like that if you want.|`|AA10780513	I had this thing called Pleurisy once where the lining of the lungs or something gets inflamed and when I took a deep breath, it felt like someone was stabbing me in the ribs.

I think you could use a doctors opinion and they can help you find out what's wrong.|`|KtCRMHI9aa	that certainly sounds like a broken rib, guy...i've had many...if it is, a doc can't really do anything...he'll give you something to help with the pain, though...and regardless, and especially since you have asthma, you need to go see him/her, since you need to be sure it's not something else...|`|MtKmKDVlaa	Sounds to me like you may have broken a rib....you could see a doctor however there is really nothing you can do for a broken rib.<br>  <br>  Try Advil or some sort of pain reliever!

Soft soap, though in a different category is basically the same thing...even if you have used it for years, it doesn't make any difference...you are allergic to it now. How allergic to that will be defined by what happens to you when you use it.|`|xSw48qj8aa	If your tongue hurts that bad that you can't eat for a while, I'd say stay away from kiwis!<br>  that's weird that you used to eat them all the time when you were little though. it doesn't run in the family does it? because my whole family (basically) is allergic to cats, and i never had a problem with cats until one time, i was at my friend's house and playing fetch (haha lol) with her cat and i got a huge hive on my arm. <br>    so i think u might be allergic. stay away from kiwis!|`|PF4NTkJgaa	You might be allergic.<br>  When I was little that always would happen!<br>  Are the kiwis you ate sour or something? Coz when I eat really sour stuff heaps my toungue hurts... <br>  I hope I helped :)|`|yIRjrIwvaa	same|`|nefDWu8yaa	whenever i eat kiwi's my toungue hurts too...<br>  i think its because of the brown part. i know for sure that im not allergic so i dont think you are either.|`|77NzfiVkaa	I get the same way with fresh pineapple. It's not quite as bad as what you described, but yes it is a mild allergic reaction. I still eat it though, cuz it is delicious. :)<br>  <br>  And it isn't weird that you used to eat it but you can't now. Allergies can develop over time as you get older. Sometimes going through puberty causes new allergies too. That's how it was with my seasonal allergies (still don't know exactly what I'm allergic to). Allergies can also go away over time, so something you were allergic to as a kid, you might be able to eat now.|`|AA11091145	Hi.  I think you have oral allergy syndrome (OAS) is caused by cross-reactivity between proteins in fresh fruits and vegetables and pollens.

UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...</a>|`|FxRDrCxOaa	sorry to tell you but fat is located in certain parts of your body has to do with genetics you have to loose overall fat to loose back fat and belly fat

It works the same as Proactiv's three step system, but there's a different lotion for nights.  I wash my face after I work out, which means I usually wash it three times a day - I don't recommend washing your face more than that.  Also, what you eat and drink should NOT affect your acne.

Usually one of the things you would look for is the mole changing sizes. Another thing to look for is if it not round all around, if one side might be round and the other uneven. Look for bleeding around it, a scaly area. But definitely take her to the doctor to check it out. Being that you have told her about it, you should research on types of skin cancer with her at your side so that she can understand what's going on.
AA10350210	The systolic pressure (if you are talking about blood pressure) is the measure of when the heart contracts and pushes blood through the vessels. It is the top number on the reading. The diastolic pressure is when the heart relaxes. 120/80. 120 is systolic, 80 is diastolic.|`|l23ttRePaa	The top number is the systolic blood pressure reading.

It sounds like you have hit a plateau. You need to switch up your programs and keep trying new workouts. Do both strength training and cardio. For cardio mix it up do some swimming some running some biking some sports etc. If you do the same exercise over and over your body will adapt to it and you'll get diminishing returns. If you've done nothing but the treadmill than I bet you've hit a plateau.<br>  <br>  Also you didn't mention your nutrition plan.

People do it all the time, just keep sitting and be glad you're not donating plasma where you sit there with a needle in your arm for an hour and a half after being in the waiting room forever.

Now I am going to suggest that if your snoring is really bad that you check with your doctor about having a sleep study done. You could have sleep apnea (snoring is THE biggest symptom). Sleep apnea can be very dangerous, your oxygen levels drop, you can go into cardiac arrest. Do you feel sleepy in the daytime no matter how how of sleep you've gotten? Do you wake up coughing/gasping for air? Do you wake up with headaches? If you do, check with your family physician! <br>  <br>  If you don't think it's an apnea, then you could try breath right strips, possibly that snore spray I have read about (can't remember the name, but you should be able to find it on google). <br>  <br>  Hope this helps some! Good luck!|`|GmbuL7Bgaa	Snoring is a fairly common affliction, affecting 40 percent of men and 25 percent of women. If you snore, you make a raspy, rattling, snorting sound while you breathe during sleep. Older people are particularly prone to snoring: About one-third of people ages 55 to 84 snore.<br>  <br>  Despite its frequency, however, snoring is a sleep disorder that can have serious medical and social consequences. The tips that follow may help you sleep more peacefully.- <br>  <br>  Prop up your upper body with pillows and sleep on your side to get a better night's sleep. See more sleep pictures.<br>  <br>  Sleep on Your Side - <br>  You're more likely to snore if you're lying on your back, and sleeping on your stomach is stressful on your neck. <br>  <br>  Lose Weight - <br>  Excess body weight, especially around the neck, puts pressure on the airway, causing it to partially collapse.<br>  <br>  Avoid Alcohol and Tranquilizers - <br>  Both alcohol and sleeping pills can depress your central nervous system and relax the muscles of your throat and jaw, making snoring more likely. These substances are also known to contribute to sleep apnea, a dangerous condition that has been linked with cardiovascular disease. And they should never, ever be used together. If you have difficulty sleeping without sleeping pills (or if you use alcohol to help yourself fall asleep), discuss it with your doctor. <br>  <br>  Get Your Allergies Treated - <br>  Chronic respiratory allergies may cause snoring by forcing sufferers to breathe through their mouths while they sleep. Taking an antihistamine just before bedtime may help. If your nose is stuffed up, try using an over-the-counter saline spray or a humidifier. <br>  <br>  Buy a Mouth Guard - <br>  Your dentist or doctor may be able to prescribe an antisnoring mouth guard that holds the teeth together and keeps the lower jaw muscles from becoming too lax. <br>  <br>  Stop Smoking - <br>  Smoke damages the respiratory system. <br>  <br>  Keep a Regular Schedule - <br>  Get plenty of sleep. Go to bed and get up at the same time each day.<br>  <br>  See a Doctor if You Are Pregnant and Snoring - <br>  Sometimes, women who are pregnant will begin to snore. The snoring may begin because of the increased body weight and because the hormonal changes of pregnancy cause muscles to relax. Whatever the cause, snoring during pregnancy may rob your baby of oxygen. Talk with your doctor about it.<br>  <br>  Elevate Your Head - <br>  Sleeping with your head raised may take some of the pressure off of the airway, making breathing easier. Raise the head of the bed by putting blocks under the bed posts, or prop up your upper body (not just your head, which can actually inhibit breathing) with pillows.<br>  <br>  Excessive snoring may also indicate that you have sleep apnea, a serious sleep disorder. The National Sleep Foundation (www.sleepfoundation.org) recommends that you see your doctor if:<br>  <br>      * You wake up during the night choking and gasping for breath<br>  <br>      * You have been told that your snoring is disturbing to others<br>  <br>      * You don't feel refreshed when you wake up<br>  <br>      * You are extremely tired during the day<br>  <br>      * You wake with a headache<br>  <br>      * You are gaining weight<br>  <br>      * You have trouble concentrating, remembering, or paying attention<br>  <br>      * Your bed partner notices that your breathing pauses during sleep<br>  <br>  -It's important to have sleep apnea treated, not only because it interferes with your daily functioning, but because it boosts your risk of vascular disease. Sleep apnea can be treated with lifestyle modification, surgery, oral mouth guards, or a CPAP machine, which blows air into the back of your throat while you sleep. For more information see Sleep Apnea In-Depth.<br>  <br>  I will post some links here that I hope help you.   :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stopsnoringtipsnow.com/?t202id=616&t202kw=stop%20snoring&gclid=CNPUtbG9-5gCFSPxDAodhnmsmg" rel="nofollow">http://www.stopsnoringtipsnow.com/?t202i...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stopsnoringtips.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stopsnoringtips.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.putanendtosnoring.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.putanendtosnoring.com/</a>
f2KRMmMJaa	You honestly need to discuss this topic with your dr since there are so many options. But at your age you really have only 4 options, the pill, vaginal ring, patch and shot. I don't recommend the shot, too much hormones, weight gain, and possible facial hair. But the pill, patch, and ring are basically all the same medication. But the pill can be a hasle since you HAVE to take it everyday around the same time. The ring, you leave in for 3 weeks, and leave it out for one week. But for me, sex hurt while on the ring, and I personally hated it. But the patch you change every week, and I found to have the least amount of side effects compared to any other option. But if you pick the pill, there are many options out there, but I recommend yaz. It has many benefits that you can discuss with your dr.

CciXZNYraa	Here are a few tips;<br>  <br>  WHEN to eat for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Eat (at least) three times a day. <br>  Because when you eat only once a day, your metabolism gets slower than it already is! That's the main reason. Sounds funny, but to lose weight... you must eat (the right things, of course) <br>  ? Eat low-fat, high-fiber foods such as salads and vegetable pastas.<br>  ? Your last meal should be before 18:00. Try. <br>  OK, one apple after 18:00 <br>  ? Don't starve <br>  Starvation is not good for losing weight, nor your health. <br>  Starvation is the worse thing you can do in a weight loss diet. <br>  ? Try oatmeal instead of cornflakes for breakfast--eating oatmeal can help reduce cholesterol levels, and its high fiber content will keep you full longer.<br>  <br>  WHAT to drink for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day ! <br>  Can be tap, plain, mineral, sparkling. I just love mineral sparkling water! <br>  This improves your bowel, reduces the "hunger" sensation, and hydrates your skin. Your skin will look much better after the first weeks! <br>  Don't believe the slogan "water makes me fat". Beside being stupid... you might get into serious troubles with your kidneys. <br>  ? Drink ONLY natural juices, freshly squeezed! <br>  Don't drink Coca Cola, Pepsi, Spite etc. during the diet. Even lite or light versions. <br>  ? Avoid those vending machines by carrying around your own healthful foods and leaving pocket change at home.<br>  <br>  Exercise for losing weight... <br>  <br>  ? If you want quicker results - exercise would be good. <br>  ? Don't just sit in front of the TV and eat peanuts... <br>  I guarantee THIS won't work for your weight loss... <br>  ? Start a regular exercise program and stick with it. Don't be afraid of those sweat suits and Lycra pants! <br>  ? Start swimming. Swimming is an excellent exercise to get involved with, since it increases blood flow and uses muscles we don't regularly use. Start a swimming program and try to do it 3 times a week. You will feel excellent and rejuvenated.<br>  ? Choose an exercise program that you enjoy, and don't shun the unconventional. For instance, did you know that regular vigorous dancing is exercise too?<br>  ? Also Cardiovascular exercises such as running, jogging, or aerobics will help you lose that unwanted belly fat. Weight training can also help you lose body fat because the more muscle mass you have, the more ability your system has to burn body fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	To lose weight (fat), include more fibrous slow digesting carbs, as opp. to the fast digesting ones. <br>  <br>  No white breads, fast foods, sodas (not even diet) no ketchups, sugar, only skim milk, not 2%, skim and whole grain non sweet (sugary) cereal, whole wheat bread, maybe buy some soy or whey protein.<br>  <br>  Include lean meats like ham, and other sources of protein. Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging. Be active!<br>  <br>  Jog stairs ;and also do some lunges until it burns, do this every day or 2 days, keep going and don't give up, same with eating, you need some fat, so one or two fish oils daily.<br>  <br>  Eat fish (not fried, be careful, very careful for bones) Peanut butter on whole wheat (no jelly), which has protein, and don’t worry about the fat in that.

Hey, and guess what, us other nudists don't give a s#!t either. If you want to be a smoothie, fine. Wax it or shave more often so your skin gets used to the frequent shaving, but don't do it because you think other nudists care how long your unit is. We don't.

I would suggest trying wax (yes it hurts) it tends to get you smoother, less chances for ingrown hairs (OUCH) and it takes longer to grow out so less itchies! If you are going to use the good ol' razor, then shave daily, so you don't have the little hairs that grow, no itches that way either.

46f08ffa5c76fa0a99f7bd318d1d05d2aa	Long, but I hope it helps...<br>  <br>  Different braces are more visible than others. I wore a Wilmington brace from under my arms to just over my hips for 10 mo., then had surgery shortly before I turned 14 (1985). My top curve was fused using stainless steel Harrington rods and bone chips from my hip. I had to go back into a brace about a year after my surgery for 10 mos. while my bottom curve stabilized. Neither of my braces was too visible. Clothes could easily hide them.<br>  <br>  With both braces I had to wear them for 23 hrs./day. You have to have a strong sense of self and not let it mess with your idea of body image. It's clunky and you don't look/feel like everyone else, but keep in mind why you are wearing it. You want to keep your body as healthy as you can and try to correct your back. <br>  <br>  Liking your brace...The first few nights, it was hard too fall asleep in. Once you get used to it, sleeping wasn't too bad. But now, some days if I'm feeling a little achy, I miss it. You could be lazy and let the brace do the support work your muscles usually do.<br>  <br>  The braces...figure flattering they're not!  You'll have to adjust your size. But you have a legitimate reason to go shopping! <br>  <br>  Some braces are larger than others, some more visible than others. Being where mine was, axilla to hips, it wasn't very visible. I wore loose babydoll tops in the warm weather, and sweat shirts and sweaters in the cool. You may be able to go up a size or two, but also check out maternity or plus size clothes (some of the same designers for juniors and misses are designing for maternity and plus). Maternity tends to work better because only your torso is changing sizes. Pants and shorts go up a size, elastic waists, drawstrings, or you can uses one of those expand a waist button extender things. <br>  <br>  Hot weather in a brace...your brace, curvature, and physician determine how many hours a day you wear your brace. I was only allowed out an hour a day. <br>  -I stayed inside as much as possible (although our AC broke one summer, ugh!). Read, go to movies (it's always freezing in our cinema), the library, shopping, etc.<br>  -On mild days, I laid on the floor in front of an open sliding glass door, the breeze would blow in a little between the brace and my skin…spent lots of time reading that way.<br>  -Always wore a fitted sleeveless undershirt (A-shirt) under the brace (mens come in packages of 3 and are cheaper than womens); prevents chafing<br>  -On days I was outside, when I came back in I wiped any skin that was under the brace down with rubbing alcohol to remove the sweaty, grimy feeling (get your mom to do your back); wiped down the inside of the brace; and changed into a fresh undershirt.<br>  -I was only allowed out of the brace an hour a day, unless I was in the water swimming. So I swam whenever I could talk my folks into taking me. But you have to be in the water, not just hanging out at the pool.<br>  <br>  I'm as normally functioning as anyone. Having surgery in summer, I never got off schedule with school. Graduated college at 20 and have been an OR nurse for 16 years, one of the most physically demanding areas of nursing (lots of lifting and lots of standing in one place for long periods). I've had 2 children without difficulty (didn't even use an epidural). I love to travel (I don't set off metal detectors), yoga (though the fusion prevents some positions), and SCUBA dive. I can pretty much do anything I want...but don't tell my husband I use the scoliosis to get out of vacuuming :) My bottom curve aches now and then, I'm supposed to take 1-2 Alleve at bed time, but us nurses are awful patients, so I don't do it regularly.|`|BsGT44FWaa	Well, I wear a boston brace for scoliosis and have now since I was in 6th grade (I'm in 8th grade currently). Anyway, you should get your brace about 2 weeks after your measurements are taken. Having a brace doesn't really "hurt" but at first your body can be a little sore while getting used to the adjustment. Now im usually more comfortable IN the brace than out. <br>  <br>  My brace inspired me to make a website for girls like us who have or are getting a back brace. It has hints, tips, advice, and so much more.<br>  You should check it out : www.freewebs.com/urnotalone  (u might have to copy and paste)<br>  <br>  If you have any questions, comments, or just need to vent feel free to e-mail me at soccerchic_102794@yahoo.com <br>  <br>  Hope that helps!
ParFJxnSaa	I suggest that you practice the Progressive Muscle Relaxation, and try the other relaxation techniques in section 11, at ezy build, below. Medication is an option for later; if they prove insufficient by themselves. BPD is addressed in section 15, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> Be aware that, because of their upbringing, people suffering from BPD tend to see things in terms of black and white, rather than shades of grey, and often idealise, then devalue, in relationships. They also tend to have a great fear of abandonment, and sometimes go to extreme lengths to prevent it. A tendency to abuse alcohol and/or drugs, or high risk activities may be present. Use the locators, in section 1, at ezy build, and the phone book, to find a therapist who uses Dialectical Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or get a good book on the subject, and give to a therapist using Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy (fairly common, and probably nearby) and ask that it be incorporated into your treatment.<br>  <br>   Read "I hate you: don't leave me." by Jerold J. Kreisman, m.d. and Hal Stras. A workbook that offers good coping skills is Marsha Linehan's Skills Training Manual (a DBT Workbook). The Stop Walking on Eggshells Workbook: Practical Strategies for Living With Someone Who Has Borderline Personality Disorder by Randi Kreger and James Paul Shirley Try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/</a> for these, and others. View: <a href="http://www.2knowmyself.com/uieforum?c=showthread&ThreadID=72" rel="nofollow">http://www.2knowmyself.com/uieforum?c=sh...</a>   ~~~ THERAPISTS: It depends to a certain extent on what your tentative diagnosis is: people with Borderline Personality Disorder, for example, need to be challenged from time to time, by therapists using DBT. A good therapist will get you to examine the appropriateness of your actions, or thought patterns, and offer the occasional suggestion. Some therapists, however, work from an "I know best" basis, and, even though they may actually do know best, their approach often isn't as conducive to progress as others, who take more of a middle position. On the other hand, there are those who try to be your friend, when what you really need is expert help. I suggest that you try at least 3 new therapists, and initially select one you feel most comfortable with, because a good degree of rapport (which takes time to build) can help a lot, with therapy. Closely examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators, there, and/or in the index page of section 1, at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> (and phone book, but only if necessary). <br>  <br>  Personally, I'd select a clinical psychologist who believes in only recommending minimal necessary medication, if at all, because they don't issue prescriptions, so are considerably less likely to be involved with the rewards, and inducements offered by sales reps from "big pharma": the large drug companies, to psychiatrists (there are links to, or articles on how psychiatry has become corrupted by money from drug companies, and "how doctors are being manipulated", in section 1: worth reading!). It's important to not only feel comfortable with your therapist, but also to know about their qualifications, and the type of therapy used (read section 1). Some people are in therapy for many years, and pay a small fortune in fees, so recognise that therapists may have a vested interest in keeping their patients coming back. It pays the rent, and permits them to feel that they are fulfilling a useful function in life.|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	First of all, many people are misdiagnosed. If you do not have fear of abandonment or chronic emptiness, it isn't borderline. It may be bipolar or PTSD from serious sexual abuse. Google "complex PTSD" for more info on that.<br>  <br>  The best treatment for borderline is DBT (dialectical behavior therapy). Apparently, over 80% of people get much better with this treatment, and in a person's 40's, hardly anyone has full  borderline anymore (you kind of grow out of it. Probably you pick up coping skills as you age, would be my guess).<br>  <br>  I don't think meds help true borderline very much - the DBT is the thing to do.  But if you are misdiagnosed (common!!!!) then you need a proper diagnosis. I have bipolar and was sexually abused, and got labelled borderline many times because of many suicide attempts, but I have no fear of abandonment, and many excellent relationships with others. It turned out Ativan was causing all my suicide attempts (paradoxical reaction, common!!!!)<br>  <br>  Walking on Eggshells is supposed to be an excellent book.

FVDbVcnCaa	Well there is no "normal" way to measure that. From the Human Sexuality class I'm in we went over some Sperm facts two days ago actually so it's funny I saw this Q. She read the longest recorded ejaculate and your's wasn't as long as that so no worries. Different things contribute to how long & how much comes out. For example not masturbating for a while and then blowing your load will increase how much and how far it will come out as opposed to masturbating in the morning then later that day... not as much will come out.
TYFSWhh3aa	there is no way except surgery.|`|osY0xlhTaa	The most effective and safest way to get a bigger penis is with penis enlargement exercises. The idea is to gradually increase the capacity of the chambers in the penis to hold blood. The bigger the chambers are, the more blood they hold when you get an erection, and so the bigger your erect penis is.<br>  <br>  Pills don't work because all they do is increase the blood flow, not the amount the chambers can hold. At best all they'll do is give you harder erections.<br>  <br>  There's a good site with info on all the different methods and detailed exercises at <a href="http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.BiggerBetterMan.com</a> - check it out.

You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|2324ca2619e6dee826826d027a6a3effaa	That sounds like a very healthy plan to me! The only thing is it is impossible to predict how much weight you will lose in two months. 3500 calories equals one pound lost. This means you either need to burn 3500 calories or eat 3500 calories less to lose a pound. You can google "calories burned calculator". Then you can plug in your height and weight and age and it will tell you how much you burn on a regular day. Then you can see how many calories you need to eat or how many calories you need to burn. A healthy goal is 500 calories less a day. 500x7 equals 3500 so you will lose a pound a week. Losing more than 1 or 2 pounds a week means you are losing muscle too. Muscle helps to burn fat even when you are doing nothing, so you don't want to lose the muscle!|`|I4aTlL4Faa	yes that's perfectly fine. But don't go under 1200 calories!...... as long as you balance proteins and carbohydrates (yes we need carbohydrates for energy..) you should be fine. My advice is substitute all white flour for whole wheat because is less process and the body digests it faster  and it doesn't convert into fat. Example: brown whole wheat rice and bread, bake sweet potatoes instead of white or red potatoes., vegetables like broccoli are perfect because they don't have that much carbohydrates and are high in fiber.

AA10344737	It is best to wait at least two weeks before having sex without a condom.  Personally, I would go more.<br>  <br>  Your weight can influence how the birthcontrol works. Generally, the heavier you are, the lower the rate of protection goes down.  Also, stress can play a role.  More stressed-->lower protection.<br>  <br>  Again, at least two weeks. And when you do, make sure to have plenty of handtowels nearby.  Things get messier!<br>  <br>  Have fun and congrats on being responsible and taking birth control!<br>  <br>  *Just a personal note.  I would continue using a condom since the STDs are out there.

6sPcYQr0aa	If you still feel fat, than you are just not happy with yourself yet. So, get in better shape, stop trying to lose fat and start thinking healthy. <br>  It doesn’t really matter what you eat (besides the obvious junk food) and when you eat it, as long as it has the nutrients your body needs and you give it to your body when it needs it.  You cant forget protein, which is not only a main building block for your body but for your mind as well. I will explain.<br>  One of the worst things you can do to your body is stop eating. Your body needs fuel just like your car needs fuel. And just like your car, the better the fuel and oil is, the better the cars performance, the better the food and liquid is that you put in your body with too make you "run" better.<br>  If you are trying to lose fat. Try to raise your metabolism by eating smaller meals, more nutritious meals, and about five or six meals throughout the day.<br>  Also, remember that if you are working out you are also building muscle, and muscle weighs more than fat does. So as you lose the fat and gain the muscle your weight might not adjust for a while until your muscle building reaches a plateau and your body begins to really tare away fat.<br>  If you do not want to eat five or six small meals a day. Eat three meals a day, smaller portions, then between breakfast and lunch have a healthy snack or meal replacement shake, and another between lunch and dinner.<br>  The idea is to teach your body to get rid of all extra fuel it doesn’t need, which are fats, carbs, and simple sugars for the most part. And once your body begins to understand that you are giving it the fuel it needs when it needs it, then your body will no longer store fat cells as a fuel reserve.<br>  It is also a good idea to use a body cleanser, or detoxify before beginning any change in diet. Especially if you are going to begin eating healthier. The process might cause head aches or muscle cramps depending on what your body has become used to. Also diarrhea is a common side effect of most cleansing programs, but don’t worry this is a sign that your body is getting rid of the toxic substances. The cleans will help your body to easily extract the nutrients it needs from the food you intake and bypass the rest as waste.<br>  To expedite the process it always helps to concentrate on full body workouts to keep energy storage empty. Also, drink water, water is used to clean your body inside and out. Stay away from caffeine and soda.<br>  This will take time. But once you are able to achieve routine with your eating habits it is one of the easiest ways to keep the fat off.<br>  So with this, your diet can be very flexible as well. You can have sweets and things but for best results I would stay away from all simple sugars, like candy.<br>  Good luck and God bless.|`|871Wx9M2aa	Yes, there is something wrong.  Sounds like you have unreal expectations for yourself.  Your stats are good.  Don't get the wrong idea, because you will always until the day you depart this world want to improve yourself.  Its part of what makes us human.  Get with a personal trainer and learn how to build and progress both with the right diet and the right exercises.  With that body, toning up and little definition you would be awesome.  Just do it right.  Oh, and to build requires eating good plentiful nutritious foods.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck and love yourself first|`|rMbmVzEqaa	Yeah there's a major problem: You have no self confidence.<br>  <br>  <br>  5'2 107 34 24 32<br>  <br>  <br>  In the end, those are just numbers. What matters most is how you feel.|`|OgTvqmJ9aa	you are perfect.
ItJzrvQ4aa	There are numbers of reasons why a person is not tall, and most of them do not<br>  have any effective treatment.<br>  Probably the commonest cause is genetic, that is to say that one or<br>  both your parents are below average height, or that short stature runs<br>  in your family. There is really nothing that can be done about this. <br>  The other cause that most people know about is a deficiency of growth<br>  hormone, which is produced by the pituitary gland situated at the base<br>  of the brain. If a deficiency of this hormone is discovered early<br>  enough in life, it is sometimes possible to give treatment with<br>  injections of growth hormone to increase height. However, by the time<br>  you get to 17 years of age, your bones may not respond to the effect<br>  of the hormone. The only way to find out if you have this condition is<br>  to discuss it with your doctor. Blood tests an X-rays to see how your<br>  bones are growing can usually make the diagnosis, but for treatment<br>  you would need referral to a specialist. These investigations should<br>  also show if there is any other cause for your short stature. <br>  But you should not think that it will definitely help you. Medical<br>  science can not make you the way you want to be - and it is true not<br>  only for height - so it's better to accept yourself as you are. Tall<br>  people are not necessary happier than short people - look at the<br>  tallest man in Ukraine, who was stripped of his title, lives alone<br>  with his mother, and has constant legs pain!<br>  The exercises they advertise on-line may increase your height<br>  temporarily for 0,5 - 1 cm, it's hardly noticeable and does not worth<br>  the trouble: your height varies during the day on its own.<br>  Very occasionally, surgeons will try an operation to lengthen the<br>  bones in the legs. This is very difficult, and takes many months or<br>  even years, and a series of operations. It is a dreadful operation,<br>  and I mentioned it only because you may have heard of it. Never<br>  consider mutilating yourself for a miserable increase in height, and<br>  be happy as you are.
Q5qpMLOVaa	Your body needs various resources in order to fight off the virus. All this extra work will result in an increase in metabolism.|`|6sPcYQr0aa	It should slow down if you aren't eating as much, but if you do the right thing and force feed yourself through the pain of the sickness and keep your metabolism up you should get better faster.
EYNfbJbeaa	Targetted weight reduction is quite tough, many people would declare impossible, nevertheless the one method that definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it was highlighted in Fox News and USA Today. I shed 25 pounds, it definitely does produce results!
wwwy8bmOaa	well are you over weight , excercise, or have heart problems????|`|mHSaUWv4aa	Me too. I find that I feel better if I get LESS sleep. You're probably always OVER tired.|`|JD3p3GG6aa	you sound like your anemic, low iron can make you feel tired and weak. Try some more iron in you diet.|`|rAcHFUvyaa	You should go to your doctor as you could be anaemic and may need a blood test to check this.<br>  <br>  Being anaemic means you have a low level of iron in your blood which can make you tired all the time and not have much energy.<br>  This is what I had and my symptoms were the same as you describe, I had multi vitamins too but not iron and that was why.<br>  <br>  If it's particularly bad around your period, then you should definitely check, as you lose iron from the blood lost which makes it worse at that time.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

AA11101968	Ask an actual doctor, not Yahoo answers.  Come on!|`|6hBKoN6Jaa	Well first off, your girlfriend needs to go to the doctor to confirm that she is pregnant.  If she's in pain for some other reason, she definitely needs to see the doctor.  Try making an appointment for her with the doctor so you can get the true answer for this question.|`|AA10313901	She needs to get to a doctor because she may be having a miscarriage.|`|9OyIL8P9aa	Yes she can take Tylenol but I would get her to the doctor to get a pregnancy test done, because if she thinking that she might be and is in pain,then it is possible that she might be having a miscarriage( I should know I had one in Dec)|`|LGdwi71Qaa	tylanol is the only safe med to take for pain while pregnant.
9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, it could interfere with your period by potentially causing more bleeding (an example only).<br>  <br>  I would recommend checking with your doctor as well to see what they say.
UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|wqZbkYpMaa	i think they are all great

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  If man made it, don't eat it<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Walk your dog, or walk a friends dog<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

Also, jog for 30 minutes every morning. <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/diet/atkins-diet-what-it-is" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/diet/atkins-diet-wh...</a><br>  <br>  Acceptable food list:<br>  <a href="http://www.atkins.com/Program/FourPhases/WhatIsInduction/AcceptableFoodsList.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.atkins.com/Program/FourPhases...</a>
gwVQo1NIaa	the reason why you are spotting instead of having your period is because you are stressing therefore your body is in shut down mode which is not allowing your body to function right... same thing happened to me but i didn't have my period for 5 months straight from stressing that i was pregnet... but i wasn't all along! stop stressing so your body can get back into rythem... other than that go to the Doctor you might need to get your hormones checked... email me and let me know how you go.. also the morning after pill can have that affect..|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	Don't worry, it's probably the Plan B, it can really mess with your system. You should probably take a pregnancy test just to be safe though.|`|MBGAocDNaa	i'd get that **** checked out|`|e1f14553031ea73247b5b1290c459513aa	The only way you are going to really know is to go to the store and get a pregnancy test kit. If you get lucky and it isn't a pregnancy, you should call you doctor and discuss this with them. Is this the first time its happened? <br>  <br>  If you ever have a condom failure like that again, immediately talk to Planned Parenthood about "the day after" pill which is designed to help in situations like this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-topics/emergency-contraception-morning-after-pill-4363.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.plannedparenthood.org/health-...</a>|`|IAejVIFmaa	Calm down!<br>  I think its prolly stress, but you should take a pregnancy test just in case.<br>  lovelove,<br>  Jules|`|764Hudunaa	uh oh|`|PdDbzxvzaa	Don't worry if you are preganant you can have a quick abortion just buy the pregnancy test if it comes positive just goto the clinic and get an abortion.|`|h5NP5HEwaa	I don't think you're pregnant because even though it's late you got your period ..You can't get your period when you're pregnant unless you have two uteruses but thats rare. Just get a pregnancy test to be sure|`|MHQkgpdqaa	i think its just stress and the plan b.<br>   calm down! stress will make your period worse and late .<br>   doctor told me this .<br>   relax i doubt your pregnant. !|`|eYmIlVnGaa	you could be, take a pregnancy test. Plan B pill isnt guarantee but it sounds like you're most likely NOT and the plan b pill just messed with your cycle some.|`|J8XL3u7aaa	uh oh just maybe the only way to tell is that special test PREGO TEST but yea could be caused from stress see a doc|`|hMF3kg3Baa	Go get a over the counter PG test and check it out.|`|6NJqxRNmaa	YOUR EL PREGO|`|4lQ5AuUcaa	plan /b/ always works|`|3fW0hMJiaa	if you took plan B then more than likey you are perfectly fine.  stress can cause your periods to do funny things.  you are ok.|`|7mgf3sxcaa	If I was you I would go to the doctor you might have more to worry about than just being pregnant Like STD|`|icUCVqn6aa	this best thing for you to do is take a home prgnacy test or get a blood test that tell you quicker
afnPGd0raa	Ha ha well its sometimes random rare but true most of the time its because its because its somewhere in your bloodline like maybe your grandma or something<br>  <br>  Still its very possible.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	While your blood type has to take after you parents blood types, the rhesus (the + or -) in your blood type can be different than your parents. It can cause some problems during pregnancy if you and the baby have opposing rhesus'. They probably think the baby has a + rhesus (85% of people have a + rhesus) and are giving you a suppressant so your body does not attack the baby's blood cells.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	Something odd happened to me too. My mom is an O,  so obviously I was born an O, but a few years ago I had my blood drawn for something and it came back that I am now a B. ???.  It's unexplainable, I don't know.|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	Yes it's possible. Your parents are probably heterozygous for rhesus D antigen, eg CDe/cde or cDE/cde. One of their 2 genes is rhesus D (antigen +) and the other is rhesus d (antigen -). You seem to have inherited both genes coding for absence of the D antigen ie cde/cde.|`|xMnN99T8aa	I believe that the type would have to follow but not necessarily the Rh factor. There should be tons of info on line or ask the Doc.
2eGMXYaIaa	Yeah but it likely won't be the healthy way.  And if you shred it too fast and with improper methods you are more likely to gain it right back.  <br>  <br>  You need to do cardio! When I say that you have to work hard and get your heart rate up. So many people say they do cardio but they walk or job leisurely on the treadmill or elliptical. Running is the best way to shred excess fat (make sure you have good knees). It's not about losing 2 or 3 pounds here and there because it is very easy to gain it back. You have to change the complexion of how your body functions. Consistency is the key. <br>  <br>  The more you workout your metabolism will burn fat at a higher rate. <br>  Eventually you want your body to work for you, not work for your body (if that makes sense). And if you want to lift and workout I recommend doing high intensity circuit workouts where you are doing an exercise one after another, to again, get your heart rate up and increase your fitness level (not be one of the those people we do a set, rest for 2-3 minutes and do another one). There is too much down time, that's good for increasing strength but not overall fitness. Diet is just as important as working out!|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Maybe if you follow a really strict and detoxing diet like the juice diet.  And don't start thinking it's going to taste great, because you are going to be drinking everything:<br>  <br>  Morning Sunshine Smoothie<br>  2 large oranges<br>  1 red grapefruit<br>  6 frozen strawberries<br>  1/2 banana<br>  <br>  Squeeze the juice from the oranges and grapefruit.<br>  Put the juice in a blender and blend with the strawberries and banana.<br>   <br>  <br>  Watermelon Dream Juice<br>  2 cups cubed watermelon, cold<br>  2 cups cubed cantaloupe, cold<br>  1 inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled<br>  <br>  Pass the ingredients through a juicer.<br>   <br>  <br>  Strawberry Thirst Quencher Smoothie<br>  1/2 cup frozen strawberries<br>  1 cup orange juice<br>  2 tsp. fresh squeezed lemon juice<br>  <br>  Put ingredients in a blender.<br>   <br>  <br>  Carrot Cleanser Juice<br>  4 large carrots<br>  1 stalk of celery<br>  1 apple<br>  handful spinach<br>  juice from 1/2 lemon (optional)<br>  <br>  Pass the ingredients through a blender.<br>  <br>  <br>  I know a girl who lost 20 lbs on it but let me tell you she spent a good amount of time in the bathroom :/<br>  <br>  But this juice diet keeps your metabolism up so you won't get fat when you stop juicing.  Drink 4 juices a day, don't eat anything.  Do it for a month, then off for a month.  Alternate and you will actually be healthier because it cleanses your body.  Good luck.|`|uVCo4pGoaa	Wow, i was basically in the same boat as you about a month and a half ago. You need to change your diet and start exercising. I know it's probably not the answer you want to hear haha, but diet pills and other weight loss formulas really don't work in the long run. Ill tell you what I did. I searched the internet high and low for solutions to quick weight loss, but I didn't really want to take any diet pills. I came across this website that said you could lose 9 pounds in 11 days, so naturally I was like no way! but, i still went ahead and looked at it! I finally decided to just try it, i had nothing to lose! I ended up losing 45 pounds in a little less than 2 months!! I was stunned... but it really does take dedication, and you need to follow the plan, or obviously the results aren't guaranteed. <br>  the website is below, i strongly recommend at least trying it.. it worked for me!!<br>  hope everything works out and good luck!|`|5KAreKDjaa	Apparently the only way to lose weight is drinking tea and eating berries ^^ Probably not the best solution, stupid scammers.<br>  Anyway that works out at 5lbs a week which is a lot! Umm you'll have to totally slash your calorie intake to probably an unhealthy level but yea it's possible. I hope you have a skip full of will power!
AA10098963	Your 3 previous answers are correct.  <br>  <br>  I went on a strict diet and stayed on it for a year--losing tons of weight and eating mainly vegetables.  I then went on a maintenance diet and upped the calories a bit but stayed away from fats.  I religiously kept of journal of everything I ate/drank during the day--compete with totals of fat, carbs, and calories.<br>  <br>  I ended up in the hospital for a totally unrelated ailment.  My cholesterol was through the ceiling.  The nurse insisted I had been eating fried foods or eggs.  She actually became rather argumentative.  I then gave her my food journal that I took with me everywhere I went.<br>  <br>  When my doctor arrived, he pointed out to the nurse the errors in her assumption.  Some people just have high cholesterol naturally.|`|5iOHJHUzaa	You got great answers I just want to add one more thing. The fact that you're a vegan makes your high cholesterol less dangerous.|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	Sure sounds like it's genetic. However a really good diet can result in a high cholesterol due to a predominance of HDL. If this is the case then you have nothing to worry about, in fact this type is protective. However if you have high LDL then this is not so good and yes it would be surprising in a vegan but possibly hereditary. In this case you would probably be advised by a doctor to take medication.|`|5KAreKDjaa	geeeeeeeeeeeeeenetics! More and more doctors are starting to think that hereditory factors have more influence than diet.<br>  Btw cholesterol is made up of two numbers. One (your high density lipids) should be nice and high and the other (low density lipids) should be looow. So it's actually not how high the total number is but the ratio of these two fats. So maybe you have a high total but a good ratio?|`|6NXJNOjJaa	could be hereditary...
AA10554882	You don't specify what day you took the Plan B pills. <br>  <br>  Is your period on time? Was it earlier or later than expected (had you not taken the pills)<br>  <br>  Plan B is known to interrupt your regular cycle, it could come earlier, or up to two weeks later. If it was a 'normal' period, then you should be pretty confident that the pill worked. Give your body a couple cycles to regulate itself. You would worry if you didn't have a normal period up to 2 weeks after taking the pill - then, pregnancy would be a possibility.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps some.
CJ75pkgzaa	I'm no trainer but keep this diet up, strictly though and yeah it will work|`|1ss17pyzaa	sounds ok include more protien in our diet to help with your muscle|`|Slys1OJqaa	I had way too many pounds in all the embarrassing zones until I tried out acai berry, I know they say that pills don't work, nevertheless they sure worked for me, and they've been featured on CBS News too.

I used to do that all the time... or you are so busy that you realize you haven't eaten all day so you end up coming home and instead of eating a real dinner you just like eat the fridge!? yeah I had some serious problems with those, but I ended up kicking all those habits over time. I actually started a program online. It tells you all the "secrets" to weight loss and all the mistakes that people make, which make them gain weight. It teaches you what to eat, when to eat, and how much to eat. And if your up for exercise, it even tells you what you can do in regards to that. It worked for me, and if you really dedicate yourself to it, it can work for you to. I would follow the plan for like 2 days and then I would want ice cream or something so bad, so i came up with a little trick... its kinda bad but whatever. everytime i wanted something bad to eat, i would go to my room and put on a bath suit just to remind myself why i should stick to the plan! i ends up working really well! try it, and let me know what you think! the website is below<br>  hope everything works out, and good luck!

rwDGnWyZaa	Hi there. I am just like you. Full time job, a baby, and a house to clean. Where's the time, you ask? You have to make time. Here's what you do. Buy a workout video and do it at home. It's easier said than done, but you have to put your mind over the matter. If you can give yourself 40 minutes every other day, it's a reasonable, yet practical goal. Lay your workout clothes out the day before you workout and then as soon as you get home from work the next day, put them on and workout--even if you don't want to. Try it for 2 weeks instead of one..and so on and so on. Once you get past the two week mark, you'll feel like you have to do it.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, push the baby in the stroller throughout your neighborhood. A brisk 30 minutes is all you need.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you! =D|`|I8SjPyeBaa	try dancing you exercise your abs, legs and arms. Tery  drinking more water and cutting your portions of food.

Get over the hump! Soon you will find that working out is quite exhilarating! It will give you more energy and you will feel refreshed. Just give your body time to get used to it. Start out slow w/every other day. Don't push yourself too hard or have unrealistic expectations. Leave something to look forward to for the next workout. Incorporate a workout while you clean.

Those 12 pounds werent fat though, so you still have all the fat you had. What you have lost is muscle, water, and parts of your organs which have deteriorated. Keep it up, and you'll start noticing blood coming out of your body from your heart lungs and other organs being ripped apart for energy<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit<br>  <br>  Omg you're not even anorexic. You're TRYING to be anorexic. Well im glad you're trying to do something you cant. The guys right. Once you eat you're going to gain around double what you lost. So thats 24 pounds right there. CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!|`|t81MEJ82aa	Not eating and losing weight is worse and by a mile. I'll never understand why people starve themselves and go on crazy diets instead of eating healthier and exercising. Would seem a lot easier to do, not to mention safer.<br>  <br>  You may have lost 12 pounds now, and you will probably lose more weight next week if you do the same thing but your body is going to think you are starving and slow down your metabolism. By losing weight this way, you will mostly lose muscle and water before the fat comes off, which is not a good thing. Plus starvation does damage to your body because you are depriving yourself of key nutrients therefore causing damage to your bones and internal organs. I've never seen an old anorexic. While being obese is not healthy, it is better than being anorexic by leaps and bounds. It's not even close.<br>  <br>  But about time you start eating again your body will hold onto the calories and not allow you to burn it. If you are doing this for looks, have you ever seen good looking anorexic? Have you ever seen a mentally balanced one? You certainly never heard of healthy one either.|`|x3EPqezJaa	Anorexia kills something like 10% of the people who have it, and severely damages the bodies of the others--their bones and organs have been damaged by starvation, and they'll likely die of something related to that.

3VeqE9Oaaa	Hi Gemini,<br>  <br>  The flrst questlon that comes to mlnd, ls what changed? what ls the source of your welght galn? stress? a boyfrlend? work? any new pattern change, or life shatterlng change? Have you talked to your dr. lf you see no changes? lf you know what the 20lbs ls attrlbuted from, then we'll know better how to make the change. The next step ls not stresslng over lt, because the stress leads to pressure, whlch becomes unbearable. l teach my clients to let go of where they've been(for you, the 120lds, also because, let's face lt, you are now 23, and your body ls changlng, hormones etc, so you can't thlnk of welght as a number anymore, because you can't go back, and lt's only golng to assure failure lf you just focus on 120lbs), but lnstead to focus on what they can do to be posltlve NOW, and put lnto affect a healthy eatlng plan. You have an ok dlet, but be careful, don't go overboard wlth the frult, veggles, breads or salad dresslng. Though we thlnk they are healthy, they still have calorles and the carbs add up, and work agalnst weight loss efforts. <br>  <br>  How many meals per day are you eating? You should be eatlng 5-6 small meals per day, balanced, but lower ln carbs(these meals keep you blood sugar levels steady throughout the day, and boosts your metabolism, so that you burn fat. Eat foods more like egg whltes/wlth 1 yolk, talapia, fresh tuna,lean red meat, oatmeal, potatoes, 4-walnuts, a tsp. olive oil. <br>  <br>  Tralnlng 5 days? 1 & 1/2 hrs? way to much! The key to welgh loss, ls to have more muscle mass, the more you have(l'm not talking bulk, so don't worry), the more fat you burn, but all the tlme you are tralnlng, you will burn that muscle lnstead of the fat. To loss welght, you need to lift weights, try different ideas each tlme you traln, but no matter what, don't do welghts more than 3-4 days per week. On the other days, do LISS(low lntenslty steady state) walklng, nothlng fast, no lncline, just your normal walk, 40 mins ln the mornlng, (when you don't lift, on non-welght tralnlng days), on an empty stomach.....thls burns fat & calories. Later ln the day, do another LlSS, the same way, but thls tlme only 20 mins. before dlnner, after school, work, but remember, on non tralnlng days....DON'T TOUCH A WEIGHT! LET YOUR BODY REST! On the days you lift, don't do any morning cardio, but you can still do the 20 mins LlSS later in the day. lf you can get your 40mln walks and lifting sessions in the mornlng early as posslble, thls will get your metabolism roaring throught the day, then hum along with the 20min boost later. So, the few days you lift, you will build muscle, and eat enough to keep it, so you lose weight. Once you begin to thlnk thls way, and adopt these prlnlples, remember, muscle welghs more than fat, so the scale may not move much, but you will look terrlflc, feel great, and need new clothes. Thls ls the hard part, keeplng my clients off the scale! Stay away from the dlscoraglng mlnd games that the scale plays. lf you follow thls concept of welght loss, you will be adoptlng lifelong changes that will brlng you a healthy welght throughout your life, and you won't need a scale. When you feel yourself slipping, because lt does happen, scale back on your carbs ln your dlet, but never panlc. When you are active, you need more carbs to fuel your activity, to hold onto muscle. When you are less active, due to whatever takes place ln your life, you need less carbs, but never go zero, ever!!!<br>  <br>  Do allow youself to have one food per day, that you will enjoy and maybe can't live without.....l have a small bowl of chocolate lce cream every night.....yep, the trainer does! I am active, l can burn lt up. Please remember the lmportance of balance ln eatlng and a tralnlng plan, never go extreme wlth one, becasue they go hand ln hand, you won't be successful wlthout both balanced!<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!

796222031a5d3c4eed560bdbe8ac734aaa	Yes, it is a different type of work out. You probably burned more calories on the elliptical because it is a workout that your body wasn't used to. It's good to switch up your routine. When your body gets used to a certain type of exercise, it because more efficient at it and burns less calories. <br>  <br>  Switch things up, and gradually increase the difficulty if you want to keep seeing results.

eurEdK41aa	Well, for only being 5'2 that is considered overweight. However, we must keep in mind that since you are so active much of that may be muscle tone, but nevertheless it can't all be muscle tone. A healthy person of you hieght should way 110-120 lbs. However, if you carry a lot of muscle tone and are probably big boned that you can stand to be 125-130. Now this is on the assumption that you have all this muscle tone because the problem with you might be that even though you exercise a lot you probably have a poor diet and eat unhealthy food. This is typical for people who are very active because they feel they don't have to worry about what they eat anymore, but that is not the case. If you start eating healthier and keep exercising you'll probably loose some weight and still keep some nice muscle tone. <br>  <br>  Still don't feel bad about yourself, everyone's different :)|`|gF49d7Jcaa	Because theyre *****.|`|TCctLAPCaa	Uuuuummmmmm you need to lose weight hun.

Dreaded it to the point of making myself sick over it. Unfortunately, you're going to have to make up the time at some point. My hairdresser and I once had this discussion, and he skipped so many gym classes in high school that he had to make it up in summer school. The good part about it though was there were no jocks in summer school for gym, so that may be a good out for you.
6wZbsPn2aa	Well, in the US that is 5' 8" and 174 pounds.<br>  <br>  This is overweight- but not by a lot. Your chest size does not necessarily have to do with your weight. I think a healthy goal for you would be to lose around 20 or 25 pounds (around 11 kilos). <br>  <br>  Keep going to the gym and drink plenty of water.<br>  Hips exercises would be side-way crunches and trunk-twists (which is moving your torso from side to side).<br>  <br>  Best of luck!
