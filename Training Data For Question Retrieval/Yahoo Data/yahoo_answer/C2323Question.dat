Couple years back when i was 10 in primary school i was at home because i had a banging headache. Someone kept on phoning constantly for like 1/2 hour and b4 my dad went to work he said dnt pick the phone. After like an hour of constant phoning i picked up the phone and said F word off to the person calling me turned out to be the receptionist at my school. The next day i went to school and they were all angry with me but i never knew that in the background they all thought what i did was funny. Apparently they were laughing there heads off in the staffroom about what happened and were saying "you must have really pissed him off" and "that's hilarious".       So are teachers really that layed back i thought they were always serious. My mums a Solicitor but she got a degree in teaching so she teached for a couple of months. And told me how teachers laugh at the "dumb" kids etc and they say "ahh i just teached the dumbies" and how they love the smart kids and hate the bad kids and kind of talk about them like saying "that one will never be a success his dads probably a druggy"      So is it true that teachers are that layed back and laugh about ocurrences like my one. And talk about students in the staff room?

Today speaker was one of the most respected iconic figures in the aviation community; he is aviation enthusiast, aviation mechanic and a pilot .Winner of Charles Taylor Master Mechanic Award. A president of Aero club of Pennsylvania since 2005 till 2007. His name is Walt Ellis, start learning his flight lessons in Jan19, 1958 at an area called Ashland, New Jersey.    After earning his privet pilot license, he continued his passion in pursuing his commercial rating, Instruments rating, multi engine rating and earning his CFI certificate.   Because of airlines rules and restrictions back then he wasn’t able to get haired by any airliner due to his vision limitation and for not holding bachelor degree.    For his love and passion to the aviation he didn’t quite, he found his area of expertise where he was accepted and welcomed as Airframe and Power plant mechanic besides becoming an Inspection Authorized licensed.    At the end of his speech Mr. Ellis give a word of advice from his golden experience by saying “propeller is important today and the spinner is the most important”.   I am pretty sure without the A&P airplanes and airlines cannot fly anywhere. Matters of fact lots of airlines depend on mechanics heavily on maintaining their airplanes to keep them self in business. But in the other hand this job considered one of the most hardest jobs ever that takes lots of responsibilities in making the airplanes airworthiness and checked to be up in the sky . An A&P Mechanic is responsible for completing maintenance on aircraft in a timely manner. I cannot see myself as mechanic due lack of interest. Since the opportunity is wide open to me in choosing my career I am still dreaming of becoming a pilot, and I will pursue that dream no matter what it takes and to do everything in my power in not letting anything stop me.

Must such a request come from a company or can a private citizen request such information? Seems like some times it is the perpetrators who are protected.

How is the general student body?      I'm curious about learning more.  By the way I'm from Minnesota.

I took intro Chemistry and Biology at my state school.  My average for those was 3.2.  My major was Econ and Math with a 3.5 GPA.

20081016050644AA8r2Ef	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Why pay professors for their lectures?	I don’t understand the educational system that we have in the world today. Like at my university - I have 4 lectures per day. The professor comes, reads his lecture and he earns good money for each hour of his lectures. Why not get those professors to make a text version of their lectures and post them at a university learning portal (like the one we have). If he needs to update his lectures, he can do it anytime online to keep the learning process up-to-date.       The students could be more flexible with their time and learn with the speed they prefer. And the government would spend less money on those lectures. I don’t think that receiving information in a lecture is better than receiving it while reading the same material. Besides if you miss a lecture it’s such a hassle to get the material of that lecture. You have to ask your fellow students to let you have a look at their notes, you have to go to the library, look for those books, where you can find the material that you missed and spend hours trying to find the right information. Why not get those lecturers and professors make things easier and make their lectures into a text version for the students to read them – just like you read a book?

It was Saturday morning, and I constantly screwed up my eyes in pain. Jillian had dragged me out of bed an hour ago, and now I was lying almost dead on the couch in the corner of the room.      “You so deserved that…” Hanna came over, looking sternly at me. “That’s what you get when you’re hanging out with Matthew McGregor when he’s drinking.”      “What?!” I yelled, but quickly calmed down, because my head just ached more when I spoke louder. “I didn’t go to bed with him like any other girl would do!”      Hanna threw it off. “I’m sure you would have if you’d had only one more sip… what got into you? You’re the Head Girl, for crying out loud!”      I looked at her, my eyes poisonous.      “What about the Head Boy? He wasn’t exactly sober either?”      Hanna just rolled her eyes and sat down next to me, wrapping her arms around my body.      “Sally… That was a bad, bad, BAD move. Do you even know what you did before we came and rescued you?” She whispered, keeping her voice down so I wouldn’t cry out in pain.      “Can’t say I do,” I sighed. “Unless Matthew or anybody tells me...”      “Do you call him a reliable source? He had been drinking too, you know.”      “Yeah, well, he wasn’t drunk! He probably remembers. I’ll go ask him,” I said firmly, trying to get up without getting the feeling of a thousand knives burying into my body.      “Oh no, you’re not! I’m getting him down here, you can’t even stand up properly,” Hanna exclaimed, getting up and making sure I settled down again. “Be back in a moment…”               “It’s the party-girl!” James came over to me, singing in a cheerful voice.      “Get away, James, your decibel-level is a bit too high for me right now…” I murmured. I pulled my blanket over my head, covering my probably hideous-looking face.      “Ok, sorry,” he whispered and came to my level. “Anything I can do for the tired girl with the worst hangover?”      “A glass of water would be nice…” I yawned.      “A glass of water it is!” James yelled, smirking and dancing up and over the floor.      ‘Ouch, that yell hurt…..What’s with him today? He seems unnaturally happy…’      Will came over next, I didn’t get why I had to be so popular when I just wanted to hide away and sleep in the closest cupboard. He was looking tired as well, but not nearly as bad as I did.      “I’m surprised you’re still alive, Sally!” Will said irritably. “Guess who dried up all the stuff you threw up last night?”      “Sorry,” I said, trying to reach out for a hug.      “Don’t think so, Sally… you still stink, I’m afraid. Don’t know what made me come over here in the first place!”      “Ah.” I blushed a little.      “Well, be glad you threw up, or you might have ended up in the hospital. You didn’t save any, to put it that way…”      “Hm… can I ask you a question?” I dared to say, still half-hiding my face.      “Sure, shoot,” Will smiled, sitting down at my feet.      “What did I … er… do when, well, you know… the alcohol had started running in my veins?” I forced out.      Will pretended to be thinking.      “Hard to tell how many bottles you had, but it sure came up again after some hours. Before that you lost it completely, you just messed around like drunk people happen to do, you know?”       “Meaning?” I said firmly, sitting up as far as I could manage without passing out.      “Well... You noticed James being a little… happy this morning?” he began.      ‘Holy mother of God! I couldn’t have… That’s not POSSIBLE… Please tell me I didn’t sleep with him… Anything but that… Oh my GOD!’      My mind was going berserk. My eyes were widened into a shocked expression, and I held my breath as Will continued.      “He made you… well… let’s just put it this way; you’ll slaughter him when you find out… that…”      “TELL ME!” I yelled, throwing myself down onto the couch again as the pain ate my brains out.      “Ok, Sally. He made you burn all the stories you’ve written for… well… practically every month up till now. Then you had a nice little twisted game of snap, or ‘strip snap’ as Matthew called it, ending with you sitting there in your underwear laughing like a little baby with your unfocused talking. When you were about to remove the straps of your bra, Hanna and Jillian burst in and rescued you…”      ‘What? Thank God they came in time… thank God I didn’t sleep with James… Or showed him my more intimate places… Oh, the relief!’      “And not to mention… You kind of went at it with Matthew.”      ‘NOOOOOOOOOoooooooo…’      “WHAT? What happened! Am I still a virgin? Will!!”      He laughed at my desperate reaction.      “I must say Matthew impressed me. The poor chap stopped you when you were half-way through pulling his trousers off. You went mad, Sally!”      ‘No, no, no… this isn’t happening!’      “Sally, be glad it ended there. Be happy there weren’t that many seeing you behave like that. Because that could cost you your badge…”      I started crying. I was so super-sensitive these days it scared me.      “I’m sorry, Will!

You can spice it up a little with vocab and stuff but please don't make it too ridiculously good haha even though she said i could have someone proof read it... it needs to be similar to the original. THANKS A LOT!!]                  Maya Angelou’s “Finishing school“, is full of irony.              Irony can be seen right from the beginning. You wouldn’t expect someone who went to a finishing school rather than getting a rigorous education to succeed as an author but the author, Maya Angelou, shows that she went to a finishing school saying “became my finishing school” (102). If Mrs. Cullinan, who was ugly and barren, could have had children with her husband they probably would have been pretty.  It is likely however it is also ambiguous if the Coleman girls were the daughters of Mr. Cullinan (Angelou 103). If they were the daughters of Mr. Cullinan, it shows that since they were so pretty, the “spitting image”, of their father, and didn’t look much like their mother, if Mr. & Mrs. Coleman could have had babies they probably would have been pretty (Angelou 103). Margaret used to arrive at work early and leave late but later on she would arrive late and leave early (Angelou 103-104). You wouldn’t expect it after Margaret’s reaction to the new name, Mary, but Glory actually liked her new name (Angelou 104). You also wouldn’t expect Margaret to work for Mrs. Cullinan for a week after Mrs. Cullinan gave her a new name because Margaret said about Mrs. Cullinan’s friend who suggested to give her a new name “if I was starving I’d never work for her….” (Angelou 103). Perhaps the most ironic part of the story is that after Margaret broke Mrs. Cullinan’s china for calling her Mary, Mrs. Cullinan called her Margaret (Angelou 104-105). Just as the story began with irony, the story ended with irony when “The flying crockery caught Miss Glory right over her ear” (Angelou 105).      Irony was a clear theme in “Finishing School”, especially situational irony.

Any parent who chooses to work while raising a child must balance the pros and cons and find a way to put their child first and ensure that the child is nurtured, loved, and feels protected.                I can understand there are parents that work long hours to provide for the family, sons and daughters to have the things they need such as, food at the table, clothes to wear, a roof on top of their head and feel secure, provide their child with a good education. put them in a recreation activities or a tutor center so they can get ahead in school. And most of all so that their children can get to have a lifestyle like every other kid and not feel an outcast in life.      But there are some downsides to all this as if the parents is always away from home and working, their child may feel lonely, and in need of the parents attention. Also their would be little or no communication in the household.

When I walk up she gets this huge smile and says hi with a lot of excitement that she doesn't show to other students. When the bell rings and if I'm one of the last there, she'll come walking over with a huge smile and ready to talk but I'm always in a "hurry to leave". It's awkward being alone in a classroom w/ a teacher. I'll say something to a friend or w/e (I'm a more playful and humorous kind of person around friends) and when she walks by she'll often start laughing and covers her mouth with her hand. We have similar humor and personalities. What's weird is that I've seen her many times looking at me from across the room with a smile. When I look up and see her sitting there looking at me, while we're testing or talking to friends, she doesn't look away. That's hard to read. I'm not creeped out by her. She's 28, so pretty cool/fun. I just never socialize with teachers.      What do you think she's doing? Do you think she's trying to be a friend? I didn't think teachers normally did that. Only reason would be because of personality. Cause I don't know why I'd be a standout. Do you think I should start talking to her more? Be a fave student...      Adios :0)

I'm getting close to the end of my junior year in college and I am in so much debt!  I have the Florida Prepaid College Plan but it doesn't cover everything so I'm usually stuck putting it on credit cards or borrowing from my mom to pay it.  Over a good while I've racked up some debt on credit cards with this lifestyle and I need a way to significantly take a chunk out of it here and there.  I've never applied for financial aid and I'm about ready to do so.  My question is, can I take that money I get from financial aid and use it to pay off some debt as long as I still pay for whatever tuition costs that I have?  My plan was to have my mom pay for whatever is left over and I can take the grant money and I drop it some credit debt.  I go to Florida Atlantic University if that helps.  Thanks...

20090223054358AAKWCO5	Education & Reference;Teaching	I dont know what to do about this teacher...?	Ok so I have this music teacher and to me she is out to get me.  When I started doing assignments in her class and online I always handed in my work the same day she assigned it even though we had a week to complete but I didn’t want to wait a week otherwise I would probably forget about it.  So now there’s this assignment that came that she told us we could work together so I decided to work with my cousin that is in the same class we each took a portion of the assignment and did it and then switched portions and turned it in.  I turned my assignment in first and then my cousin turned hers in (keep in mind we have a whole week to do this and we turned it in the same day she assigns it).  Then come Tuesday morning I go to music class to find out that the professor is calling students names that forgot to complete the second part of the assignment.  She calls my cousin but not me and we turned in the same thing so then I go up to her and ask the professor why she didn’t call my name so the professor looks and tells me it’s because I didn’t turn the assignment in.  I ask her how could this be and she tells me its because I didn’t turn it in on time so on the computer it says I missed the assignment yet it has all my work on it that I turned in and yet to this teacher she says hmmm that is strange so then she tells me she will look into it and to do the second part of the assignment that I missed which was what I did.  Then on Thursday the grades are up my cousin receives full credit and I receive a 20 out of 100.  So I go again to the teacher and she says oh well you lucky I didn’t give you a zero instead and I am over here like what? Are you serious? I’m going to get a zero for something I worked hard on and turned in way before and you give me a zero?  I’m still trying to fight for that grade and she tells me just forget it because I won’t be changing that grade.  So then comes the next assignment where you have to write a poem my cousin and I work on it individually and before we turn it in we ask each other for a line since we were missing one so we switched lines and worded it different then come to class and the teacher tells us it’s obvious to me that you and your cousin copied off each other so you will have to do it again and now it’s a harder one. Please help I don’t know what to do anymore

My daughter is only 6.5 and I am concerned if increasing the length of lesson time would actually be in her benefit. I feel that she does not really have very good sitting and she might be stressed in 45 minutes. Also it will be more expense for us. She is taking many weeks now to finish one piece, Earlier it used to be very fast. One piece in one week. Her teacher does not allow her to go on next piece till she is done with the previous one. I understand that with Time Music pieces are harder, but I feel my daughter should have gained that knowledge also to finish the pieces in similar amount of time.          I can not question on teacher's knowledge and experience. She is the best in this area and has 40 plus years of experiece too. She once said that My daughter has learned lot more than one eight year old had learned in same amount of time. I sit with her Practice sessions for most of the time, but not always. Also she is appearing in Theory Level 1 exam coming Sunday( I assume she will pass that). Is it a good growth passing level 1 in two years of lessons? Should I consider increasing her lesson time? Any response in this will be helpful.
20090223053514AAib4kf	Education & Reference;Words & Wordplay	Help with re-write..check for spelling & grammer!?	EASY 10 POINTS! HELP ME RE-WRITE... I HAVE A WRITERS BLOCK :(      Essay Questions 1: Discuss two photographers or artists who influenced you as an artist and citizen. Be as specific as possible. Include descriptions of artwork where appropriate.               After completing my research I have found that the people who inspired me the most were the people closest to my life. My cousin Raissa Venables, a published photographer/ artist dedicated her life to the teaching of her experiences and knowledge of photography at the School of Visual Arts. Her experiences have enabled her to travel to Germany and eventually open up a gallery there. She is my inspiration because she has taught me that even though photography might be a difficult field; those who work hard and have an education are the people that achieve the most.  After her publication was released I sat down with her and she described each piece and how it was created. Describing the importance of composition and lighting allowed me to reach new heights as I then incorporated what she had taught into my own pieces. Through her encouragement I felt confident in my quest to major in photography as she taught me to always do what I love. Along with my cousin, my uncle Gary Messenetti has welcomed me into his home to teach me the means in which it takes to become a professional photographer.  At an early age my Uncle Gary knew that he had a passion for photography and decided to dedicate his life in undercover private eye in the police force. As a second job he also photographed weddings each weekend as a way to explore his creativity. One afternoon he  sat me down and told me that success is a state of mind.  So is failure, which can be seen as success when you look at it the way Babe Ruth or Thomas Edison looked at it. You can become depressed because of your failures or they can energize you and allow you to look at your experiences not as failures but as attempts that are paving the road to success. As an artist you will rarely succeed on your first try.  This is especially true if you are trying new ways to represent the world and to express your vision. A certain amount of trial and error is necessary, and a certain amount of failure is to be expected.  If you let your failures discourage you, you will not maintain your creativity; instead you will be creative for some time, and then fall into depression when you fail to be successful at your first attempts. I have found within my own experiences that a failure is certainly a setback and it can show the limits of your knowledge. You failed not because of your lack of talent, or are incapable of success but the lack of knowledge to succeed. The process of acquiring this knowledge is what will enable us to expand our current boundaries, and it is knowledge is what will make us go beyond our actual limitations.

20090223045403AAxf3iT	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Is college the only option?	I hate college. But it's not for the normal reasons, like that it's hard, or I'm just plain lazy (which probably doesn't help, however). I currently work at a minimum wage job, and I know I don't want to do it the rest of my life, but I don't know what I actually 'want' to do. I never actually wanted to go, however, my aunts, uncles, grandmother, mother, father, girlfriend, girlfriend's family, mailman (seriously), and seems like everyone else have pleaded, begged, blackmailed, or otherwise convinced me to go. So here I am, halfway through the semester, miserable, because I have no idea how this is helping. I'm not learning anything I didn't already know from high school, and right now I'm "ironing out" the basic classes. The homework load doesn't help any, because I have to work a full 40 at work to pay all my bills (living on my own). I'm not paying for the college, as my father generously offered to pay, so I can't drop out, like I want to, because I know I didn't pay for it.      I don't so much want to go to college yet, because I know I'm just wasting time, and money (even though it's not mine). It's just drudgery. So where do I look? How do people normally find out what it is they want to do for the rest of their lives? I don't want to wait so long that I get stuck in a bad place the rest of my life, but I can't really better myself as of now, because I'd go halfway in, and decide that I couldn't stand what I was doing. Do I just do odd jobs, until I get inspiration? Or should I travel abroad? Like with the military, or red cross, or the peace corps, or something? I'm into a wide variety of interests, but there has never, ever, been just one thing that piqued my interests more than the rest, so the follow your dream stuff doesn't really apply. If the rest of life is this confusing, then it looks like a loooooong, looooong trip I'm in for.

With a little genetic tinkering, fast-growing fish and freeze-resistant fruits will help feed an overpopulated planet, but such hybrids could unwittingly wipe out the food chain. Eco-scouts will be on the lookout for so-called Trojan gene effects, and bounty hunters will help the usda eliminate transgenic species that get out of hand.       But what education do they require?

20090223072604AANyxPm	Education & Reference;Higher Education (University +)	Study abroad and admission at the Ivy...?	I am applying for Cornell and USC next fall, and also thinking about studying abroad in Argentina soon. Here is a question. I was originally thinking about going study abroad next summer in 2010, but I realized that that was after admission has been ended and the experience of study abroad would not help to get into those competitive universities.       Though my primary reason for going study abroad is not to help admission, my academic standing does not stand out great at those universities and I really wanna go one of the two.       Actually I do not have enough money at this mement for the study abroad, so I will have to loan from a bank.       I am just not so sure how much going study abroad helps when it comes to admission.      This is my academic status.      GPA 3.7    Honor student at Valdosta State University (One of the GA state institutions)   Already fluent in two languages (English and Japanese)   SAT math 760 Critical reading 690 Writing 700 Japanese 760 Math level 2 740   Communication major   Being very active in campus activities.

20090223073828AAg6rQB	Education & Reference;Other - Education	I feel inferior and worthless because I'm not a straight A student?	I always found subjects difficult, GCSEs, A-level's, and then university, I got loads of Bs for GCSEs, a D for French, and in A levels I got AAB, I didn't get to grips with English. I hear corporations as well as Oxford and Cambridge only regard all A's as being good enough (Einstein and Sidis didn't do that). I don't achieve that. But I'm good \ gifted at other things, like History.
20090223073838AA1xO34	Education & Reference;Special Education	Sent home for spitting?	Hi.  My 5-year-old son is moderately autistic and tends to spit in class. This only happens at school, as it does not happen at home.  I read that when autistic children are frustrated and upset, they spit, so I'm not sure exactly what's happening with the class.  They claim that he has occupational therapy as well as speech therapy.  By the way, he, for the most part, is nonverbal and only parrots certain words and does not communicate in normal conversations.  When I speak to the teacher and her aide, I get the feeling from them that he's a nuisance.  I hardly ever get progress reports from this teacher, and I'm really upset with the whole thing.  I'm not familiar with all kinds of cases with autistic kids, but this seems wrong to just send him home for this.  He is, after all, in a special education class.  Am I wrong for feeling this way?  Any ideas?
