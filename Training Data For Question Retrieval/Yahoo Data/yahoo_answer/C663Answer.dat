TlUWxH2qaa	Well I fell out of love once. She wanted me so bad and begged me to get back with her but I said no. I really didn't feel the love I could ignore her whenever and didn't give two shits what she did.<br>  Well 9 months later she finds someone else. I find out but didn't seem to care. She didn't sweat me anymore and I got worried. Then she goes out with the guy and I realize you don't know what you have until is gone. I lost her and realized I did love her and needed her in my life. Tables turned and I was the one begging her to come back crying everything. A month later of nothing but pain she leaves the guy and gives me a nother chance. She said she had to make me suffer and loose her so next time I had her I would appreciate her and cherish her. Now we are so in love and happier then ever.|`|7ZFre562aa	If you really loved them in the first place, the feelings wouldn't have gone away. He probably got tired of you and is trying to move without hurting you as much as he could.|`|RCfc9hMKaa	You can't make someone like you and he'll resent you for trying. Hate to say this to you, but you need to move on to something that will work.|`|7JFT4zt7aa	I'm in the same situation. I know he misses me but he won't take me back because he doesn't want to use me.

AdeD0xMuaa	Looks DO matter - they just aren't as important as people think they are. For example, looks might attract a mate but that doesn't mean they will have a good relationship.|`|JWSkzyQ7aa	Hahaha. <br>  This is were media comes in ppl. Everyone is supposed to slender, perfect and pretty. But you know what? They're people who are not that great looking, and they have better personalities than the pretties. BUT EVERYONE IS UNIQUE AND BEAUTIFUL AND THEIR OWN WAY. Not that i am bragging, but even those with decent looks, have good personalities, as many people do too. It's just that personality in the long run matters more.<br>  Do you get it?|`|4d3Md9pnaa	Looks matter if all you want is a quick **** or a trophy wife forever.<br>  <br>  Guys who are actually DECENT don't want a sexy mannequin as a wife. They actually want some brains, too.<br>  However, looks do matter to an extent. They aren't the ONLY thing that matters.|`|aGXankr2aa	Beauty & the Beast, The Hunchback of Notre Dame & Esmerelda, Wayne & Coleen Rooney, Julia Roberts & Lyle Lovatt, Mickey Rourke & anyone.  Just a few reasons why looks don't matter.|`|80t10xWGaa	They're lying to seem less superficial than they are. Looks do matter, they may not be 100% all of the equation...but they matter.|`|DKEOJ0h6aa	Really if you have the knack in you to accomplish things then you really won't give the credit of achievement to your looks!!<br>  I mean that looks are only an accessory that a person has got and yes at first sight it might be the looks that attract you to a person but until and unless you don't have the ability your sexiness won't get you anywhere rather than in the bed with a man/woman  :P.|`|cn2B9ebJaa	im from the caribbean and its different, its the girls with the curves tht finish first most of the time. the skinny ones r the ones tht get picked on... im skinny and lots of guys wud say stuff like, i cant wait for when u start puttin on wieght or u wud look so gud with a fat *** , caribbean men r more after curves. so i agree with u in the opposite way<br>  <br>  but to me really, its mostly the slutty acting stupid ones whether they fat or meg, tht guys r attracted to|`|yuOuoCfDaa	Cause sometimes, it just doesn't!!!  Only superficial individuals get caught up in that and why, because they are looking for acceptance from what they consider to be in and acceptable.  When you are good looking and confident you usually dont have a need to be superficial.  Your contentedness lies in substance more that whats on the surface.  Nine times out of ten the surface can be very repulsive!!!<br>  <br>  Regarding your question, that is how the world turns.  Most of those relationships if not established from the beginning can be the worst experience in life.  Some men marry beautiful women and have an agreement which makes both parties happy.  Their relationship is not based on false love it is more like an devoted understanding|`|c1i7Mn1Baa	Looks are always going to be important to people but in the long run looks take a back seat in a relationship.  We are all going to get old and looks will fade.  The relationships that will last through that are the ones that are based on something more than looks.  The beautiful people might get married faster but it doesn't mean it will last and that's the whole point of marriage.|`|EJVKqFiHaa	Looks don't matter. They may get intial rejections from those who look at a glance and make a decision before getting to know you, however when it really comes down to it, its your spirit people fall in love with when they get to know you.<br>  <br>  If anyone believes in love in first sight, its just lust because you don't know who that person even is. Could be emo kid or physco bicz.|`|37ana68Haa	well let me just say this when guys say looks dont matter they mean they dont matter a lot they do matter because most guys want to like what there putting there penis into lol they mean if your alright lookin then looks dont matter most guys think if your funny KINDA cute cool to be with then looks dont really matter thats exactly what it means|`|9Qx6UqsPaa	sigh it is the circle of life.<br>  LOOKS DO MATTER.<br>  but personailty is good also.<br>  i mean my bf is quite cute and has an AMAZING personailty =]<br>  but yeah i think they both count equally.<br>  i mean if all you have is looks then youve got nothing.<br>  <br>  you know?|`|oDLdqrJfaa	Looks don't matter for men.........that saying is incomplete.....it goes " looks don't matter for men but do for women" but most people shorten it down to looks don't matter.|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	no matter what you say, looks matter to an extent. you have too be attracted to the person you are with in order for the relationship to work.|`|IURGzfnKaa	yes looks do matter because verey human being is first attracted towards opposite sex because of physical looks|`|CqB5ryTFaa	Relationships are based on attraction and the initial way you are attracted to someone is looks|`|E0KhrgnSaa	the MEDIA!|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Looks do matter. Humans are visual creatures.|`|hLjTyAYXaa	Let me put it this way! Looks does matter but Personality Matters the MOST!! 50% looks 100% personality! This is for fact!|`|iBH7NTl3aa	People who do well in life do so because they sell themselves! people like them they are fun to be around!|`|Q5eLg9Hvaa	They matter to me. Why would I have sex with someone that I am not attracted to?|`|xYgFcEfwaa	for me not, i m not into physicl appeareance...|`|WMR8hVlfaa	Women who are pretty by common standards get hit on more because they look the way the media portrays beauty. <br>  <br>  You sound really jealous, tbh. I suggest you stop worrying about what other people are doing and work on your own self-esteem/confidence issues. Trust me, once you stop caring what others are doing and focusing on what you don't have you will be SO much happier. <br>  <br>  And tbh if someone is overweight and hates themselves for it, other people are going to see that and react to it. If you have a thicker body but you're healthy and love yourself then you won't have problems. But there is a HUGE difference between healthy and happy vs. unhealthy and unhappy ... and it's easy to read.<br>  <br>  If someone repulses me physically, then I can't have a relationship with them. It's just common sense. Attraction is just that -- ATTRACTION. You have to be attracted both physically and emotionally to someone in order to have a healthy relationship.|`|d97328305dbf70df85d7603032b0e440aa	There is alot of people that believe looks don't matter, but still plenty that only want to date attractive others. I must say that looks don't matter to me, but my husband is hot. Alot of time when I was single I did first get the hots for a cute guy, but the ones I seriously dated I did because of the type of guy they were. I think it may be more towards the men that pay attention to looks. My husband told me that looks don't matter, but he does look at me as attractive as well. On some chances it may be coincidence. I think it's more of the younger age group that want to date a hot guy/girl than a respectful, decent one.|`|LLSSv2Oyaa	IF you looking for a good night, or just to have a hot girl on you're arm, obvisouly you go for the hot girl who may be dumb. but if you're looking for the person to spend the rest of you're life with you go for the one that has a heart and YOU are attracted to, it doesnt really matter what others think just that you're attracted to you're partner.|`|BJXPRQVsaa	Well just like other's have answered;<br>  <br>  Looks do matter unfortunately.<br>  In my case I dont always go for the most attractive guy;<br>  i Look for that edge and the confidence that he has.<br>  <br>  Overall I think for any individual if you carry yourself off in confidence and have that different edge you will find someone that will find you attractive, you just have to believe it yourself.<br>  xx|`|NC5GCk5Yaa	looks do matter...its stupid girls that say they don't.....btw...the reason that goodl looking ppl get the best jobs is because people tend to give good looking people the benefit of the doubt.|`|z9hyTp0jaa	looks isnt everythin u should go for personality and sense of humor really thts all tht counts.|`|Grt0HdLYaa	because...looks make them bite but personality reels them in|`|MVJdwyIkaa	Wow! Great subject for controversy. My personal opinion is that looks unfortunately do matter because at first sight an opinion is made. Is it shallow? indeed!! Its the smart, well adjusted person that digs a little deeper. You are absolutely correct in your assumption. I always try to remember "don't judge a book by its cover". I saw a study done on this very topic and it said that all of us at first sight make an opinion on someone within the first 5 seconds. pretty sad huh!|`|smGdv04paa	Well, being hit on and getting married are two very different things. Obviously guys are going to hit on the hot girl, they're just human after all. But honestly, finding someone you really care about isn't related to looks for most people. Just because you have had bad luck doesn't mean that's the norm, not the majority of the time. Not to sound shallow, but of my friends and family, I'm arguably the prettiest (and they've told me so!)... people hit on me all the time, but I haven't had an actual boyfriend in two years. Literally all of my friends, and both of my sisters, and all of my cousins, are in relationships that they're either married, engaged, or are planning their lives together. The only people that I know that are single are gorgeous and intelligent. Who cares about being pretty when all the guys you date end up with someone who you'd describe as "chunky"?<br>  So, it's not the majority of the time. If you're having such a hard time with meeting the right guy, maybe try new ways of meeting people - online dating maybe? I've known a lot of people that met amazing guys online, including my amazing "chunky" sister.|`|xcJwxyRRaa	Looks have always "mattered" in the material world..<br>  we're a visual society, especially in this generation...and especially in the younger generation.<br>  it's the smart and wise people that KNOW that looks do not equal true inner beauty, brains and so on.<br>  If you look around at most regular normal married couples, depending on where you're at in the country i suppose, most are not that good looking, overweight and so on... ..at least here in this city of over a million people..trust me on that one...Yikes! <br>  I wish i could even show you ..even pictures from the papers..<br>  of course good looking people are usually attracted to other good looking people as it's a fact that Attraction is Not a Choice.<br>  Sooo, as the last 20-30 or so years have happened and all the good looking people get together and had kids, married or not, the gene pool also got better looking bc good looking people have good looking kids in most cases..and so on down the line...|`|POHWTDPRaa	Of course looks matter. But they aren't the most important thing and that's what that phrase refers to. It is used mostly by people to whom looks are incredibly important. They are overcompensating. The rest of us don't have any problem admitting we want someone we think is good-looking because that isn't all we base our decisions on, partner-wise.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	At the beginning it does because of attraction but after that it doesn't it matters what is inside.|`|jcL7gDMKaa	Yeah but the stupid girls may get all they guys but those guys only want them for sex, they have no interest in the girls' personality or what stuff they like. A relationship that LASTS and leads to marriage is based on more than just a pretty face. Guys also tend to like girls who look more natural and have curves not stick insects who have their faces plastered in chemical based products.|`|oojO4WAraa	Because they are liars.  Looks DO matter.  If they say otherwise - they are lying or deluding themselves.|`|cHM2US6xaa	Looks do matter simple as that.<br>  <br>  I never say " Looks don't matter "<br>  <br>  They do, if it didn't then we would all look the same.|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	there are psychological factors, such as face symmetry that make people more attracted to others naturally (but not by the standards of society's impression of what beauty is). that's one factor as to why 'beautiful' people get the better jobs. <br>  a lot of people say that looks don't matter, because they know that fact and want someone that doesn't care whether or not they look good. CONFIDENCE and INTELLIGENCE are the most BEAUTIFUL traits in my opinion. it doesn't matter to me how successful someone is, as long as they are true to themselves (even if they give me sh*t defending their points of view).
gibnbbWDaa	I'm not and have never been married, but I would be excited to know I meant that much to her. In my opinion its a symbolic thing and I don't think he would be anything else other than happy to wear it! Good luck!|`|sVQ0IB0Gaa	I'd think it would be a good kick in the *** to get you one. go for it.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Don't forget one for you, too! :D|`|8Ypkfr7jaa	Ok uhm, I think..... try to talk to him first about how you feel about being just married and not having a ring. He should know that - every girl wants to wear one. Tell him the idea of you buying him coz he might feel little.. like you know.. insulted if you do the thing he should have done. Good luck girlie. It's so nice of you to consider buying him the ring.|`|AA11220327	i got my husband an engagement ring a few weeks after he gave me mine.

Since I don't know you or your friend that makes it impossible to tag you guys with good nick names. Think of something they did or said in the past that made you laugh or got you in trouble, such as shoplifting-----i.e. "fingers" or "sticky" or if they fell while walking in high heels or tripped over nothing  "stilts" or  if they accidently let something slip like a dirty word or a secret. It's really all about how well you know the person and how they are.|`|B7kPUmUWaa	Nick names should be personal and come from stories or things that happen. We don't know your friends, so we can't really give good ones. Come up with them based on funny or crazy things or their appearance.

Take charge of their finances and work out how long it would be, if they went into work every day and got their full salary, until they were able to rent somewhere to live. Let's say it would take three months. Then tell them what you have worked out and tell them they have to be out in three months. Tell them they have to go into work every day otherwise they will have nowhere to live in three months. Sit down with them and don't yell, talk to them seriously. If they get their full salary and are out in three months, great. If they keep calling in sick, kick them out after three months. It shows that they are not grateful enough to you. They will have to look out for themselves.

However I stop smoking about a year after I started. Mainly because I met my husband and he doesn't like to be with someone who smokes. So I quit for him, and myself..not because my parents didn't want me to not smoke.<br>  <br>  My parents are non smokers. Both my sister and I smoked when we were teens, my mom knew it, yelled at us..which is why we never smoked in front of our parents. It wasn't allowed.|`|6c694750ebd6aa4c9fc2901e8ad350a3aa	I'm like you, I never had to hide my smoking from my parents.  I believe I am a heavy smoker now because of this.

As messed up as it sounds, i think the reason behind hiding it is out of love and you dont want to dissapoint them. my reasoning was cause i didnt want them to think they did a poor job at raising me.<br>  <br>  I know quite a few people whos parents let them despite their parents being non smokers, and that reasoning i belive is out of them not wanting their child to hid anything from them.<br>  <br>  i dont belive its abnormal, you just have loving parents|`|s072WzNDaa	I started at 13 too. Both my parents smoked, but I tried to hide it from them. My mom got kind of suspicious when she started noticing some of her cigarettes missing.

I was buying my own smokes and they knew I was hooked.|`|vR4k5iVCaa	if your gonna do it than why hide it. i mean if we say no it's gonna happen behind our backs so might as well let them do it. along with letting you know the pros and cons of what you are doing.|`|0dd0cKUGaa	It really depends on the parents.

What is funnier is that you are going to get a boatload of answers chastising you for being so shallow and cruel....of course, not everyone can detect a phony fake question.  Good one!!!<br>  <br>  Seriously!  very funny!  :)|`|rqFbNhAGaa	that is cruel, really really cruel!<br>  <br>  be the godfather it won't hurt you, it's nothing more than a title and just legally recognises that if something happend to your sister her baby will be looked after, for your sister to ask you to do something so important means you mean a lot to her, mothers don't just pick anyone to be the possible guardian of their kid you know, out anyone she picked you just accept it and grow up this is not just any "ugly baby" this is your niece or nephew! (you haven't specified gender) you are it's uncle eitherway as her brother you will be part of it's life so deal with it|`|gU8pP7d5aa	How in the hell are you going to call someone baby ugly @its your sisters son,you probably was butt ugly when u came out and what if she die you need to think about what u are saying before you in up hurting feelings,better yet someone hurt yours|`|KR3AYA7faa	Good thing you don't have to believe in hell to go there you jerk!|`|Nui0TEH9aa	Are you for real?<br>  <br>  Mr. Atheist, why would someone make you a godfather?  You suppose to be teaching/training the kid about God now why would someone pick an atheist for that role?<br>  <br>  Ugly babies can grow up to be good looking people.  Have mercy on the kid, are you handsome siblings tend to look alike and so do the children of their siblings.|`|05367a0d7cefb29c0600aa24d75c941faa	Lets look at this scenario. This exact qn is written by ur sis abt u and ur baby. She says the baby is damn ugly and that she wouldn't want to look after when ur dead. Doesn't it seem cruel to u? Who cares whether u are a atheist or not...we are talking abt family dude! I am dissapointed in knowing this qn totally...=0(|`|jvvpTwvpaa	awh dat messed up you not suppose to judge by looks dat jus mean!!!! your sis picked you bcuz she knows you would be da right person 2 take good care of her child if she passes!!! it takes a good heart to choose sum1 to stay wit der child!!!!!! and your judgin by looks!! its still your nephew and you should appreciate wat ur sis is offering you!!|`|q8R3sr0caa	First let me say this to DEM... your stupid for believing in god. Who are you to say that people not believing in god are stupid. In my opinion the bible was written by a skitzo.... hearing voices....COME ON! <br>  <br>  On another page, this is a pretty funny question.|`|vYxDiz6Caa	You Don't Have To Belive In God<br>  But Just Do It For Your Sister Anyways<br>  Hey The Baby Might Grow Into His Looks|`|Ka7DlJOSaa	First of all if you loved your your siblings you would care if the child was ugly or not!  Your an asshole!|`|0jeWHxKmaa	your stupid if you dont believe in god..|`|Cj2uorAeaa	you are not a nice person|`|zFQi5U5Naa	your a dick
2KC467tFaa	Save your virginity for the person who you really love. If you lose your virginity to someone you don't really care about and begin sleeping around, your self-worth, self-esteem, and self-respect will be shattered. You will feel like an object, and there are fewer things in the world to make you feel worse. It can take years for women to gain trust in themselves back. Self-esteem is another sacrifice. I lived that life. It may seem like it's fun and great from the outside, but it's a completely different feeling when you're the one living it. Sex is wonderful, but I never knew how amazing it should be until I met my husband. I felt loved. I was seen as a person who meant the world to someone. I wasn't just a thing or a body anymore. It took me 7 years to love myself and realize I deserved better than what I was going through. Don't do the same thing. Some women never find a way out of that life. They go on living life with no self-esteem and end up in abusive relationships because they don't think they deserve any better than that.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	Hun in some ways I think you need to rethink that very mature part.<br>  You are mostly just jealous and resentful it sounds like to me. why does love sicken you? You should be happy for people who have found some happiness.  You<br>  are acting like a spoiled little kid seeking to just be spite-full just because someone has something you do not have. Don't be that way. It is a no win situation for you that you can only blame yourself for being in.|`|oyZEs1Fxaa	wait till ur 18...ur obviously not ready..or wait till ur married|`|dPk7dr7laa	sixteen and unmarried is too young. people wonder why thye are so stressed out when they find out they are pregnant. If you save yourself for your husband you will not regret it. Sex with a boy at your age is too risky and you will have a lot of heartache. You will break up with the guy and have the humiliation of the sex  you had with him once you are no longer together. My husband and I waited and I am so thankful. I was 23 when I got married and he was 21.5. He knows that he is the only one i have been with and vise versa. I don't have people frm the past to compete with and no regrets either. I can also be honest with my kids when I tell them to wait like mommy  and daddy did.|`|3ekncEpaaa	honestly its not a bad thing to be a virgin, i lost mine when i was eleven, im sixteen now lol.... i think that what you need to do is look for a single guy find certain characteristics about that guy that you think you like and maybe show him a few characteristics of your own, love doesnt sicken you its just the thought of you not being with anyone, its normal, i personally would like you just to be yourself, no showing off... but first you have to find that guy|`|Rez6KpoNaa	don't give in i was 18 when i first had sex and that has not made me a bad person if ur friends go and rob a bank it doesn't mean u have to there is nothing wrong with being a virgin|`|l18jsspOaa	Just wait until you think you are ready.|`|t4DP30r6aa	It doesn't sound like your ready, wait until you grow up some more.|`|tLBjsrEFaa	just relax its not that big of a deal, you have the rest of your life ahead of you|`|VyWvhDjEaa	Umm don't think about that stuff! You are sixteen!|`|AA11830777	You are 16 and unsure. I would wait until it feels right. It's normal to feel left out, feel like you are missing out on the fun. This is why so many young girls, regardless of how mature they are, have sex too soon. <br>  It is okay to wait. Chances are that the one you end up losing your virginity to won't be the 'one'. However in the long run if you wait your chances of regretting it later lessen. <br>  There are so many reason to wait. Accidents happen, at 16 you are not prepared to deal with pregnancy and the emotional turmoil of having to decide what to do in the event that it does happen.<br>  Also keep in mind that even ppl that seem decent and clean can also carry a disease.<br>  My advice, obviously, is to wait. You won't regret waiting. That's for sure.|`|vXa7IeDiaa	Don't feel like that..You are still young you will have plenty of time to meet a man and get to know him and then decide to have sex.Don't feel left out because your not doing it.You having your virginity is a great thing.I am 23 and I lost my virginity at your age and I regret it. I wish i would of waited instead of doing it because all my friends were hoes and were doing it too..Just be happy for the ppl telling you their sex life.And be grateful to have your virginity.Its a beautiful thing and its something apart of you that you can never take back once you give it away.|`|rvoo4rBjaa	Make the right choice and stay pure. When the time is right and you meet the perfect guy and marry life will be good and it will all have been worth it. You are smarter than making bad choices that can cause alot of heart ache and problems. Find something that you enjoy and get really into it so that you don't have to deal with others and their bad choices.Get into a youth group at church and you will be around new friends that have the same values. keep up the good things your doing and it will pay off.
Tc1BO5kkaa	my friend is like that too! but not as bad as yours. no i dont think that you were wrong to end that friendship|`|ZZkInusMaa	no you are not wrong ! <br>  i would be angry if my friend did that to me and my boyfriend <br>  and they are pleanty more bffs in the see dont you think ?<br>  sh was probobley jealous of your relationship and was trying to get attention .. <br>  you did the right think
ZZkInusMaa	OMG thats strange !!<br>  why dont you ask her quiety why she is doing it !! <br>  because it she did it to me i would have flipped at her lol !<br>  just ask ?<br>  maybe she likes you ? <br>  good look <br>  lets hope she dosent want a foot rub lol !!|`|M6QvkEBEaa	you don't need to wait until she taps your foot again dude! you know the signals already been givin'. now you make your mov. what you have to watch out for is you wait too long and oone day the tapping stops :(<br>  go for it!
d7bJIgqlaa	I think that is a nice idea.  My husband had his dad as his best man.  I think a lot of southerners do that. :)  I think you should do what you always want and if you do I think you should tell him what you just told us...about him always being for you.  I think he'd appreciate that and be honored to stand beside you.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	That's a really neat idea.  I was at a wedding in August where the father was one of the groomsmen.  I don't remember if he was the best man or not though.|`|4lL34wJnaa	I have seen it done.  It gives the father of the groom an even more important role.  THe father of the bride is traditionally a big part of the wedding, so why not have the father of the groom be the best man?|`|4UUVrWXtaa	My fiance wanted to do that at first and when he told me i explain to him that his dad is already very very important in the wedding and i didn't think he should be apart from his mom at any time during the ceremony or reception to be with him.. (which was pretty selfish and stupid)..<br>  Now that i think about it (and have already told him too) i think is a great (unusual) idea, because your father has been with you at every step of your life and knows you like noone else..<br>  And a best man is someone who would represent that knowledge and will always be there for you.. so.. go for it!!<br>  My fiance however, has now asked his closest brother (to whom he was best man to at his wedding) to be his best man!!<br>  Good Luck and i'm sure whatever you decide to it will be great!!|`|KzNv0gmaaa	It's your wedding, you can do want you want, I think it sounds like a great idea, and I'm sure it's been done before.|`|sGP6s7uraa	My cousin's husband had his father as his Best Man and my fiance almost asked his dad to be his Best Man, too.  I see no problem in it.|`|V8uvefQDaa	My Hubby to be has asked his grandad to be his best man!!|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	Hey, Barry-<br>  <br>  I think it would be a very nice tribute to your dad to have him be standing up there at the altar as your best man.  I have heard of it being done before, too.  What's more, my mom is my maid of honor because she and I are crazy close and I can't imagine anyone else standing up for me on my big day.  You should totally honor your dad this way.|`|wWzK6eJaaa	I say go for it, theres nothing wrong with that. I mean honestly if ur dad is ur best friend or the best man u have in ur life rite now then y not. Some people would kill for a relationship, like the one you have with ur dad. I say just do it and u will prob feel better if you stick with this decision cause it seems important to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck with the wedding!!|`|xSXP7MnWaa	I think he'd be honoured. Although, the original job of the best man was to marry your wife if you die in battle... not so good having your dad in that sense. Lol.<br>  <br>  But yeah, I think it would be a really nice, sentimental, loving gesture|`|mQSk7fB6aa	I have known two grooms to choose their father to be their best man, and it has worked out fine.  The benefits of having your father are experience, and you know he'll perform wonderfully.|`|3AXlgGgUaa	I don't think that is common, but i don't see the harm.<br>  <br>  Its your day, your choice and if you want your father to be the best man - then that is upto you.|`|046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	I think it is a wonderful idea!  Congratulations on your upcoming nuptials and for having such a great relationship with your father.|`|AA11220327	a friend of mine recently had his dad as his best man, and it was great. everyone really enjoyed the idea, and the dad was very proud to be asked|`|lPXscuKSaa	Most of us down south do that. I think that it's only the people who live up north who get there ex lovers to do it.|`|xuiSfzgraa	I think it's a great idea!  If you want your father standing up there with you I see no reason why you shouldn't have him..|`|6qHHO2UPaa	I think that's an excellent idea, I'm sure he'll be delighted & very proud!|`|kN4EaiUDaa	i think its a great idea. there is no particular way to plan your wedding. do what makes you happy and the wedding we'll be beautiful
1Z0Lmrk1aa	Because he thinks she's cute and he is trying to catch her attention.
uFRIsdC7aa	MEN DON'T LIKE THAT MUCH EXTRA HAIR SHAVING.|`|3d5b2006369d379cd04e938a9cd52652aa	I am a woman and no they don't like women who have armpit hair. That would turn them off because you'd feel like a guy to them and may not smell good..<br>  Sorry but you need to keep shaving.|`|vO4uvoYBaa	hell no, men do not like extra hair especially armpit hair, thats a turn off and cause for a man to talk real sh** about the female that does that|`|AA11447210	If you are 'fed up' with shaving that means you'll not shave legs or pubes either...they are much more inconvenient to shave than pits.<br>  <br>  Sorry you're bored and trolling this morning, but for those who seriously wonder about a question like this, it would not be visually appealing by US society standards, not to mention would increase the likelihood of armpit odor even if you used deodorant.<br>  <br>  Do what works for you honey...the more guys you repel, the more options for the other women out there. ?|`|T4N6a7MQaa	That's the height of laziness. Don't shave your pubic area but by all means shave under your arms.|`|XJlD2kPsaa	its not exactly the most attractive thing, but i wouldn't call it repulsive..|`|C4bxnKDXaa	Huge turn off sorry|`|8ReUKb7Baa	I was going to say yea why not !  The guys grow their facial hair<br>  every now and then when they get fed up of shaving.<br>  <br>  The only thing is if your not in a cold country, you need to keep<br>  it x clean as it keeps the smell in on the hairs.<br>  <br>  I was going to also say, yea like x hair where ?  on the nose , the<br>  ears ?   the bum is a good place .... some people like that|`|BTrIBF9Eaa	In my experience, some men like it in the hippy/natural sense.  Many REALLY dislike it and it could be a deal breaker if that's the case. So, it might be good to evaluate who you are trying to woo.|`|u8WyN7cHaa	depends on where they have the hair...<br>  <br>  here are examples:<br>  <br>  armpit...maybe<br>  chest...heck no!<br>  vagina..oola laa (yes)<br>  booty...aah! nasty!|`|033a5e91931aa693dfd0d410087ef5e8aa	Hi,<br>  Hair on your head only...everything else should be ever so smoooooooth!|`|AA11332035	Hate it! It looks gross their and on the legs. However, I give a thumbs up on the vagina.|`|FzFSzilmaa	only if you put in beads too... :D|`|Midbg5BJaa	Hmmm....<br>  <br>  Different, I'll give you that....|`|zAzZ3xcOaa	There may be people into that... not really in the U.S. well possibly but its not to much out there.... Today's standard is to have as little hair on your body as humanly possible. Do what you want. Keep in mind though... The world is harsh... you will catch much criticism for this. So if you can deal with that... do it... Just please don't start a revolution..... cause i like hairless chicks... (well they can have hair on their heads.. heads.. not face) and the last things I want to see is half of america growing out leg hairs and arm pit hairs to prove a point... Oh god... you know Hollywood Stars would jump right on that too... <br>  <br>  I could see it now..... led by Kelly Preston and Oprah Marching down the street... "RAISE YOU HANDS FOR EQUAL RIGHTS!!!"  and hundred of women raise their hands to reveal bushes of armpit hair... ugh....|`|ED4nlW4raa	Yea, don't shave your legs either.  Then move to France and they will love you there.  But this isn't good for American men.|`|z2TjjnxVaa	No I don't think they do. It's harder to maintain your smell, on a hot day your  BO may be horrible. You'll have to start wearing mens deoderant.|`|MeGehliuaa	Well forget men, it gets all smelly and sweaty when there's hair. You want to be hygenic don't you?|`|32P7VxUlaa	My short answer would be: NO.  I'm sorry, but brutal honesty is my name.  Only pubic hair is ok, but for some guys even that's a turn off.|`|TVzA5WE8aa	hm... Women with armpit hair is hm... not a good idea?|`|FBzdlncBaa	No!<br>  <br>  I have a phobia of armpit hair on chicks. I honestly cannot stand it.
4T93bWjYaa	dude,honestly,who cares what she says/thinks.shes ovboiusly really shallow,and not worth your time.your eyes are just normal-your cute.dont worry.<br>  help me with my question pleasee|`|aGZlnzBxaa	They look "normal" to me. I've never heard of someone judging by the size of someone's eyes. I'm thinking maybe it was just an excuse to cut it off? Your eyes look fine to me. Just blow it off, if she judges by your eye size, she sounds outragously picky, and who knows what else she'll complain about!|`|0FwVGYEYaa	not really ,she is seriously tripping|`|vaM2S1RLaa	no your eyes are normal, but your friend looks stoned.|`|XsBburttaa	haha...Lol...Well, You look Foine to me...I think she dumped you because of something else. Cuz ur eyes Look fine to me. and you're Philipino so you have a normal eye. She's just trippin'. Much Love!|`|GHYHW70taa	i'm chinese from hong kong and i have pretty small eyes... but your eyes are so not big! they are just right :) dont worry about it. she probably thinks you're too good for her so dont get worried about it!|`|35u9RVVFaa	OOH! i like ur eyes and ur cute! lol (^_^)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and she only doesn't like u cuz she's jealous that u have big eyes and her's are so tiny. lol|`|gf1tCSBlaa	Nope
3P0acmgQaa	People don't always easily admit to having fetishes. I suggest try various fetish events on 'the scene'. If your fetish is a little unusual you will need to 'play the numbers game' and meet as many people as possible. Be patient. Here are some event sites for starters:|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Maybe because they think you’re going to punch them out, lol. Have you considered trying BDSM dating sites?|`|83y9Vu5oaa	maybe cuz it makes em think ur gonna punch em. or that your just joking around and you will never be dating material|`|1JB73DZJaa	wow, your question throws me off.<br>  maybe because it's weird and kinda gross.<br>  i don't know but if i were you, i've give up on my search and move on.<br>  <br>  i wish you the best of luck with everything!<br>  <br>  if you need any personal advice, feel free to visit my website,<br>  www.freewebs.com/ask-lila<br>  <br>  sincerely,<br>  Ask-Lila|`|PS83gPGoaa	wel mayb there isnt any
dfIphwUSaa	she is just a sweet and nice girl...it doesnt mean she likes u...|`|S4QBvAaGaa	First off, to answer your question, it's possible that she just might  not want that kind of relationship right now, or that you might not be her type.<br>  Secondly, stop checking people's dating history!<br>  Good Luck! :)
tKm8CdFHaa	first of all:<br>  You need to relax <br>  you found his number and sms, by that do you mean <br>  u found sms' from him<br>  <br>  are you sure her friend wasnt texting him :S<br>  <br>  they went out for a year and probably were still good friends<br>  you asking her to cut all contact from him is kind of a bit harsh<br>  she wouldnt have meant to hurt you if she did cheat on you<br>  <br>  you really need to confront her about it and find out what is really going on before you go accusing or getting all hyped up<br>  whatever you do dont go have a go at her before you find out what happened, you'll get your head kicked in :)<br>  <br>  hope i was just the slightest help<br>  xx|`|h3rN7snkaa	confront her|`|vVh7ex7daa	Ditch her! she is obviously an idiot with no emotion!!|`|mkyFiylSaa	get rid of her shes making fun of you and cheating on you.dont continue getting used by girls theyre not worth it.you are.j.hartas@talktalk.net   let me know.|`|nmiXLhwCaa	Kindly ask her about it.|`|Lj2xy1m3aa	get her alone...confront her by tellin her how mad u are bcz she's lying to u..and then break up with her showing her that ur not a just a toy and that she cant play with ur feelings...|`|WfzBxUIQaa	have u tried hitting her?|`|IOYisVssaa	my dear frend john becoz u found her x's no in her frends phone it doesnt mean she is cheating on u.its better u ask her directly wats going on and then depending on her answr take action <if u hav lost confidence on her im sure ther r lots of other people watinig in the world for u|`|HoljgV3Kaa	dude honestly,<br>  take things slow.. talk to her about it and dont get too attached yet.<br>  she cheated on you so obviously she's not THAT attached to you.<br>  Slow like a pro fast like an ***
LSXdwRDUaa	try asking her out again|`|MWCZfjjPaa	well first of all, how old are you guys? and how long were you together? just wondering because that will make a huge difference, if you guys broke up because of her parents, and she is out of high school, that is really sad. but anyways going on.. im thinking that she regrets her decision of breaking up with you big time. and that she still really has something for you. but it is up to you whether you want back into that realationship again. but then the fact that she didnt text you back makes me wonder if she is even trying any more, or if that's her way of moving on and before she could fully move on, she had to apologize so it didnt eat away at her conscience any longer.<br>  <br>  GOODLUCK!!!!
BKr3y30maa	First of all, you have only been dating him for 2 months...so the fact that he is so controlling this early in the relationship throws a big flag up in the air, in my opinion.  I would tell him that you don't appreciate him telling you what to wear, how to apply your makeup, and where to live!  Stand up for yourself.  Sounds like he is trying to change you.  Tell him he either accepts you the way you are, or he doesn't.  If that doesn't change his behavior, then I would move on.   There are plenty of great guys out there.  Don't waste any more time on someone that doesn't love/like you for you!<br>  <br>  Btw, i'm going to star this for you to see if we can get you some more opinions.|`|NqbBjS0raa	Since my answer is off the cuff and unable to chat with you at this time of post, I see underline control issue and cultural differences between you two  that permeates troubling relationship ahead. His history denotes problems and usually people who have long relationships but no solid marriage could suggest the other females in his life had enough or figured he wasn't going to cut it with them. (sometimes it's hard to read between the lines, so you might never know what happened) All else standing the age difference isn't a problem, but the cultural male differences on the way the male grow to manhood might be the issue with his personality.  ( maybe or maybe not in this case) It's hard to be objective having not seen him or met him. I think you should proceed cautiously with this guy. I don't like the vibes I get from you......Maybe I can catch you on line some time to further discuss it......|`|geamDWBtaa	what the hell, he is 38 and ur 24 ya it shouldn't be an issue, but you can do better and he sounds to controlling, and it sounds like hes trying to make you his little slave...........get away from him and make yourself happy, if that's you in the pic you are gorgeous and can do much better............good luck
wWVsxBbJaa	It means he's sorry and cares at least enough to let you know it.|`|nd1l31Ihaa	Are you kidding. Girls, when you ask a question like this, do you know that you are paranoid, or do both of those answers mean the same thing?|`|v54iRRPMaa	felt bad about it.|`|oJLntrWwaa	You are saying sorry.|`|H1eshhEIaa	If he gave you a frog, it would not be any better.    He stood you up means he didn't have the time,,,,,,or the desire to be with you!   NO, do not make excuses for him.   Trash the flower, and walk away.   He is just trying to keep you on hold.|`|Q5eLg9Hvaa	No one can tell you what he was thinking. You have to ask him and figure it out for yourself.
LETd2hQwaa	Ok, umm. What is your mom thinking? You might wanna talk to to her. Maybe she's scared of her little boy growing up too quickly. How old are you... maybe its normal (to miss her, not to live like that). You should try talking to your mom to figure out what she is going through. Missing the girl is normal even after so long because your feelings are real.|`|QC1ewfBcaa	You can. Have you been keeping in touch with her? If so then feel free. That is usually normal due loss of something close to you and like.<br>  <br>  I can't explain it, but yeah. You can, if you kept in touch. If not then she probably doesn't remember you. Ya know?|`|CuHspVa7aa	No, most people don't have the time nor resources to move and revolve their lives around their son's random girl he just met.<br>  <br>  But about your question, that's personal. If your emotions are still there than you're missing her. That's the way it is but yeah it can be common to miss someone like that, particularly for people who don't have a lot of choices with women in their lives.
A7QROnjLaa	Take her to a strip club. Yeah we went there and had a fun time, till I got a lap dance which she paid for. lol<br>  <br>  Yes I liked it a lot.|`|GRyFxwTbaa	Go camping with her parents.<br>  <br>  Yes.<br>  <br>  No.|`|Ucovfo2Xaa	Let her sister borrow $1,000.  <br>  <br>  Yes<br>  <br>  No<br>  <br>  Haven't gotten it back yet, either.  and it's been 6 or 7 years ago.|`|oi6eHkPzaa	a gf once said to me " Stephen, you'd be much better off if you just never spoke".

That's where the healthy diet and exercise comes in.<br>  <br>  For those that say "just be yourself"; If the person's self is that they have low self esteem and they are self loathers, and they don't take care of themselves physically, therefore they feel tired and lazy all of the time; should they just keep being themselves or should they try to improve who the are spiritually, mentally and physically? There is always room to improve one's self and some times it behooves you to do just that for your own happiness and wellbeing. <br>  <br>  So "just be yourself"? If you like who you are, sure.<br>  <br>  Try "the complete idiots guide to Zen living" for starters. It may open your eyes to a whole new way of looking at yourself and the world.<br>  <br>  “When you are through improving.... you are through.”|`|69a3a186d127a8ba06157bc67c0546fcaa	If you want you feel good on the inside I think you should first have a faith, be good to others and think of other people first.If you want to look good on the outside, do a makeover change your hair and your clothes, go to a spa and get a facial...It really isn't that hard to feel good on the inside and on the outside

Evaluate this and then if you are willing to go for the genuine love life and marriage proceed to the next step.<br>  <br>  Well you meet her at times when she says about her boyfriend or asks of a girlfriend or if she asks whether you like her looks ask her the following.<br>  <br>  1) Well be frank how would you feel if I approach you for a marital relationship in mind? What if I tell you I wish to marry you? (Asian girls like being cornered and would be frank if you ask them of their interest straight forward yet with all politeness)<br>  <br>  2) Well you look too good today Well I wish I were your lover!! (This is direct yet she likes that you go heart out for her. Even if she has someone else in mind she will not start a fight!)<br>  <br>  3) Hey I want a wife exactly like you can you lend your DNA? I feel you are looking for someone else aren't you? The fact is I am your friend but I don't know whether you will like to marry someone just like me!(You let her know you are inclined but you make her feel like you wish not to hurt her. All girls love this approach!)<br>  <br>  <br>  4) Well will a girl like you are marry me? Just for a moment how would you feel if I declare my love to you? What would stop you if you are not loving anyone else?<br>  <br>  Take time but don't loose a friend and never miss a girl who wishes to get married to you. As you may never find another!

Q13UIQGyaa	he is just being an immature a**. he is making fun of you. that's what some guys who have never been hurt or been in love do. wait till someone messes up with his feelings and he's gonna come crawling after you, literally.|`|8565b49c4ec74d9d30aa73e64f8f59a5aa	question is not clear
oUDDsVu5aa	Sit him down and tell him your not wanting anyone else you are with him as long as he treats you right and if you ever feel like this relationship isn't going anywhere then he will be the first to know but until then he has nothing to worry about other than the fact he wants to get mad about every little thing ask him why he does that and if he has a point and you are making him feel like that in some way then be willing to change that but if he has no reason at all other than his own issues then let him know how it is making you feel and it must stop or the relationship will never go anywhere other than you both wasting time until it becomes to much to handle and then there is no relationship at all. If he has trust issues and you have done nothing to cause them then tell him to get over it or else there is nothing left to do because trust is a must in a relationship and if he doesn't trust you then there is no point of trying and the mad part he just needs to grow up and stop blaming you for everything use an example like if you had a bad day and you and him was going into a place and you stumbled and fell and ask him how he would feel if you looked at him and said why did you do that why did you let me fall why didn't you caught me what was you thinking i am mad at you for this even though it was my fault you where there and didn't stop me it is all your fault he would say that is just stupid to blame me for something that is your fault and your reply should be yes it is and it is also stupid for you to blame me and stay mad at me for everything that isn't my fault as well so you understand how you make me feel then so stop it <br>  If he doesn't get that then he is truly not going to get any clue to how to deal with a relationship and really needs to grow up some before getting involved with anyone.<br>  best of luck I hope this helps|`|e27fe1a9205b53137b4cbd03b8a47947aa	Leave him. now.

CCXMW0HYaa	You know, just the other day I told the girl I liked that I liked her more than a friend, and she felt the same. The reason why I'm telling you this is because I also mentioned that I didn't care if she rejected me. I cared more about our friendship...however I had to let know how I felt because I couldn't function right. Part of confidence is "not caring." You can live without this guy and you've gotten through life without him up until this point. So it's a bonus if you get him and you haven't lost much if he doesn't feel the same.

AHexXClbaa	This is quite normal when you are the youngest; your mom is having a hard time letting go.  It is very hard for some parents to realize that their children have become self sufficient and no longer depend on them for everything little thing.  If she is not satisfied with the work you have chosen, maybe it is because she would like to see you continue your education and have a better life.  Having a Masters tells me she is an achiever and wants the best for you.<br>  <br>  Have patience with her and schedule some quiet time with her and explain how it makes you feel when she acts that way.

Money is independence and that means you are growing up, and that's hard on moms.Shes not ready to lose you .She is lashing out in anger because she probably doesn't realize that shes afraid to lose you .In a moms head she is suppose to make you a strong independent adult, in a moms heart it happens too soon.Give her time and know she is struggling inside with letting you grow and letting go Spend some time with her if you can
tBkJob3daa	You have done more than you ever needed to for this woman, so don't be guilt ridden to leave her. She goes ballistic because she knows that she trapped a good guy, and why would someone like her ever want to let that go. It won't be easy, but get out of this abusive relationship and find a woman that you love and vice versa. Life is just too short for these kinds of head games and not all women are like this.

So, if that doesn't mean that he likes you, I don't know what does. Good Luck.|`|HoljgV3Kaa	alrighty... you sound like your somewhat young so I'll be brutally honest.<br>  <br>  Don't waste your time wondering. Hangout with the dude, dont even ask him to ask you out, just get to know him and let him know you. If he likes you sparks WILL fly... period. Chances are he's young too and prolly asking the same things himself. Maybe he's shy so he wont ask you out. Maybe he knows his twin likes you. Seriously attraction isnt a secret code, you just know when they like you, make it obvious you like him and if it turns out he doesnt like you like that, dont fret about it. Obviously he likes you to some extent otherwise he wouldnt be so friendly around you. Whats all this dissn and stuff, i mean seriously? no offense but thats high school stuff
YXRRpodKaa	When you made the decision to cut the ties from the men in your life you should have demanded him to do the same. It's never to late. I don't think it has anything to do with jealousy. I understand that some people have friends in their lives and they will never be a problem to your relationship, but we all have some that will be if we let them. It took me while to really grasp how important that is to do.(cutting my past out)<br>  <br>  I was in a serious relationship for a few years. He randomly dumped me, and of course being single again I gained a lot of new male friends but still clinging on to my ex. When I met my current boyfriend It was hard for me to instantly cut them out. I knew I had to because they wanted more than friendship but I didn't do it right away. So my boyfriend and I together blocked/deleted them people from our lives. They were causing so much trust issues and they weren't worth it. I deleted all of my ex's poems, and pictures and everything. It was holding me back from flourishing in my new relationship. It was hard but it got easier. I'm thankful I was able to move on successfully and be happy in my new relationship.<br>  <br>  I remember arguing with my boyfriend "Its not like I'd cheat on you. He's just my friend nothing more. Why should I stop? Its all innocent." Then it hit me one day. He and all the rest of the guys aren't important at all. They don't mean anything at the end of the day. They just caused tons of issues between my boyfriend and I. <br>  <br>  No way in hell would I talk to someone of my past knowing it will just damage my relationship. Some people need that extra push to realize things, and if wanting my boyfriend to stop talking to the girls of his past makes me insecure, paranoid, selfish and immature, then I'm guilty! But, we're happier than we've ever been.<br>  <br>  Seeing as you're engaged, its best to sort this all out before walking down that aisle. As well as all the other issues that are secretly bugging you. Example, Another issue I tackled with my boyfriend was how I didn't like him watching porn. I thought omg he'll think I'm asking to much and just dump me. I was thinking, he'll never understand how it makes me feel. Then after discussing it numerous times. He got it, and realized how much it affected me. <br>  <br>  Good luck, remember who cares if others think your jealous or insecure. Its your relationship, and YOU need to be happy too.<br>  <br>  =)|`|umsyPxlEaa	It has to be both ways otherwise it totally is not fair. If he can talk to them than so can you.|`|1AP5gVygaa	Hey. From what I've read it appears that you have a certain justification<br>  for being upset given that you have sacrificed a friend due to his childish behaviour for the sake of the relationship. The main issue here is trust. Can you honestly put your trust in him and accept that he is only speaking to these people in an innocent capacity or do you think otherwise? Since you know him far more than we do, I can only say that you yourself have to decide whether you can trust him. However make sure that you get in touch with your ex and be friends with him - if you want that - and if your partner throws a tantrum tell him if he can have friends so can you. Hope everything works out for you. Take care. :)|`|R5IAmQAVaa	It sounds like your fiance is being honest with you... no lies... what more can you ask for?<br>  <br>  Honesly, yes, you are being an insecure, paranoid, selfish, immature, *****.... BUT... I don't blame you for doing so.  Its completly natural.<br>  <br>  Just be glad he is honest with you, there are tons of women who wish they had someone who didn't sneak around their back to do things, and get used to it.|`|yQ17wBSgaa	Have you told him how much it bothers you? If you have and he continues this behavior it means he has no respect for you and you shouldn't be marrying him.

U need to have a serious talk with him and let him know how you feel.<br>  <br>  In the same breath though, its really nice that he's so open with you, to the point that you talk to the woman. That is not too common. Almost sounds innocent, but the point is that you're not comfortable with it.  Talk to him|`|aGZlnzBxaa	Well, lol.<br>  I guess I would call it jealousy, but you DO have the right for how you feel. I am in the same situation (kinda). My boyfriend and I talked about marriage, not engaged yet, but we have had some rough spots. The thing is he cheated on his ex when he got with me, saying he wanted nothing to do with her, and as SOON as we got together and she broke up with him (after finding out we were together), she starts calling MY phone, coming over OUR house, and he even helped her move. I was REALLY pissed because of the fact that it was his EX which he said he DID NOT want nothing to do with anymore. I am the jealous type, just because I've worn my heart on my sleeve and been taken advantage of. But, I dont see how in any way it is right for any man to stay in touch with someone their partner isn't comfortable with them talking to, and then to get mad if you talk to an ex? I can't really tell you what to do because I dont know myself. It just seems unfair, and we shouldnt have to put up with it!|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	He is being totally disrespectful to you and if you think for one minute that something weird isn't going on then your sadly mistaken!  No guy treats a woman he truly loves and cares for this way.  So it sounds like you need to either put your foot down or you need to move on because I would be willing to "bet the farm" that he isn't being faithful in every way...physically, mentally etc... You are not paranoid or selfish or immature... you are being a realist.|`|vvdc5EnTaa	well I deal with this same problem. You do need to be more sure of yourself and remind yourself that you are the one he is with but at the same time, you need to let him know what you can and can't handle. Still comunicating with a girl he used to swap nude photos with is unacceptable. I wouldn't allow it in my marriage. What you need to do in order to make this work is to accept that he has friends *which I think you are doing already* but tell him what his boundaries are... like no flirting, to not be friends with his exes. <br>  <br>  But I am paranoid myself. This is just what I would do. If he doesn't listen then he doesn't care enough. You have good reason to be concerned.|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Your right, your not the one with the problems.I totally agree with you and what your saying.He shouldn't be talking to none of his exes and any other woman in that way.Your saying it's innocent? is denial..do you want to go through this while your married? it's basically telling him it's ok, you really don't have a clue what they're talking about behind your back or let alone what they'll do if they meet up..he is basically telling you to accept this and because you love him so much your close to doing so.My advice would be to tell him,it's either you or them..because you simply cannot take it anymore (it has nothing to do with insecurity..and if you are,the things he's doing is causing you to be this way) if he chooses you then he should cut them off and if he doesn't..then you should just move on and cut things off,because somewhere down the road,they'll be problems and you don't want to marry a guy, who talks to other women all the time.|`|e50e6ca9411acd39c8aec91e4abe2b89aa	Have an open and honest talk with him. Tell him to place himself into your position. The two of you need to decide what is good and workable in your own personal relationship. And in my opinion yes you have every right to be upset with his behaviors. These are not casual friendships. Don't fool yourself. You should give him a taste of his own medicine. Rekindle your past relationships. And see how he likes it "obviously not at all" I would certainly reconsider my decision to marry him.

AA11659805	I'm getting married in 16 days hun.... my parents and siblings will not be at my wedding.  They do not approve of this marriage (i'm mexican and he's white) but i've been with my fiancee for 4 yrs. now so I've gotten over it... His family and our close friends will be there so it won't bother me.<br>  <br>  I don't think it's weird at all.... stuff happens in life and sometimes it's out of your hands. If people ask, well you can either explain the situation or politely say that it's too personal to talk about.... and hopefully they get the hint.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully this helps :)|`|3gljWitCaa	i dont think its weird at all<br>  no one in my family is invited to my wedding, personal choice<br>  but my fiance's family is all coming.  <br>  its not weird, there's no rule saying that both the bride and the groom have to have equal number of family present<br>  <br>  good luck and congrats on your upcoming wedding :)<br>  hollyy|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	The only person who was at my wedding from my side of the family was my dad.

I don't think that should be one of your main concerns.. You should pick the people who are closest to you and have been there for you - not just choose people because of blood relation. <br>  Congrats!! Hope everything works out perfectly :D<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Oops, I misunderstood the question.. lol.. Sorry 'bout that.  I agree with everyone else who posted, it's not weird.  I chose which ones of my family members were invited, instead of inviting all of them. <br>  Just don't divide seating up into, Bride's and Groom's side, and most people won't even notice.. And if they do, just say, "Unfortunately they couldn't make it."

You can maybe send out of town people the website address and they can figure the date out for themselves.|`|m0WUEtqXaa	Its your wedding , do things your way.

Remember if this had been sex and she ask you to stop and you didn't it would be rape. Maybe she feels you don't respect her enough. Or maybe it shows that you think she is the only one for you and she thinks she has you wrapped around her finger and you won't leave her so she thinks she is control.  The next time she leaves you for her friends just walk over and say since your so busy I am going off with the boys and do just exactly that leave her alone, don't hang around moping so she can show off to the other girls how she controls you.  She should soon get the message.|`|eknuWrLLaa	Yup.<br>  Step 1<br>   Break up with her n tell her she doesnt love you<br>  Step 2<br>  Ignore her ( yea it gonna b hard cuz u love her so much) <br>  Step 3<br>  See how she reacts. If she cares , then getting her attention will become the least of your concerns!! ;) You will have all of it.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Dont give in 2quickly when she comes crawling back trying 2convince u that she does love u. Make her sweat n really learn her lesson! Be patient n strong, it wont happen overnight!<br>  <br>  Ps/warning: THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF SHE REALLY LOVES YOU!|`|CKXESdfuaa	hrd to tell<br>  give her some space and see what happens<br>  if everything is the same dump her.|`|GyTS5dYiaa	i am a girl so i can give you adivce because i did the exact same thing to one of my boyfriends so get ready.....<br>  <br>  she is not that into you anymore... she may say that she is when you guys talk but in reality she just doesnt want to hurt u because she knows u like her alot... 16 is to young to be getting tied up and you need to just be a kid... i know that having a girlfriend is fun but when you hit 17 and 18 you are going to want to go out and not have to worry about her... she fact that she is leaving you hanging and "neglecting" you  (whatever) that means just shows that she isnt in this whole boyfriend/girlfriend thing anymore............. cut the strings before she cuts your heart into peices.................. TRUST ME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br>  GOOD LUCK HUN
P0TpiScPaa	It all depends on that person and what type of person she is.<br>  But if she likes to party then nothing should be wrong with it.|`|EdB0ghKwaa	Sometimes girls like this, as they know you fancy them!  Then again, it can put some girls off if they think that is all you're after!<br>  <br>  My advice (as a 36 year old who has been there and done that!), is to take things slowly.  Girls will probably find it a turn on, but there is no need to rush into things!  Try not to be too smooth, and don't make the girl feel as if she has to respond to you.  The best sex is with someone you love and respect, not a one night stand.  Men and women see sex differently, with men it is spreading your wild oats, and with girls it means something.  Take your time to get to know this girl before you take it further, and practice safe sex!!!!!!|`|fb0ad31580ee2dd9c25d798bf0b062dfaa	of course! they love it. that means that the guys thingy gets bigger and girls are turned on by that. i know i'd love that!!!!!!|`|Px990WYDaa	depends.<br>  <br>  if you already know the girl... cool<br>  <br>  if not and shes a slut, she'll like it.. otherwise yuck. just trying to dance.<br>  <br>  did she keep dancing with you, if she did then im sure she enjoyed it|`|52yQw4gsaa	well for me when that happens i laugh.

They don't want to get sexual or their dance partner.<br>  <br>  Some aren't disgusted because they see it as compliment.|`|V3uY8Cyzaa	depends on the type of girl but earthier they would laugth at you or they will be creep out or they will like it and if they like you.|`|dCJx9vEVaa	lol well it depends on the girl..if she likes you she wont care..if she doesnt like u then shes gonna think ur gross and weird|`|PTEiY7O1aa	slags will love it<br>  decent girls will be a bit like ewww wtf?<br>  <br>  but then what decent girls 'grind' with boys?|`|Z96I7wlgaa	and you jizzed in your  pants...lol jk sorry uh that would be creepy and i would lagh about it later with my friends|`|E5Ya66Ibaa	if they like you its not as bad but its still a little off putting|`|2xveInVWaa	Well some girls do.

You don't know what love is yet.<br>  <br>  Anyway, your mom is a quack.|`|iLKnmyAMaa	your moms a tightass, and she's not gonna change her views just cuz you tell her to. you could try showing her how much you "love" him (even though you have no earthly idea what that word means when you're that young) and she may be more lenient.<br>  <br>  by the way, i wouldn't recommend having sex right now. you're really young, and even if you are really safe, things happen. if you don't even wanna talk to your mom about kissing a boy, then you REALLY don't wanna have to tell her you're pregnant. plus, it's a HUGE change, emotionally. wait until you're older, cuz you never get your virginity back.|`|eknuWrLLaa	2tell u the truth, your mom is right! She is trying 2protect u from guys cuz they can b assholes! <br>  <br>  I lost my virginity @ 16 yrs old n am now 20 n after 3yrs of being with him, i am not with my first any longer.

eii7o9Poaa	because people who cheat don't think about the other person and how it will affect them. This man who cheated doesn't love his girlfriend. He might say and even think he does, but he's probably never experienced love because if you were actually in love you'd never want to risk that for sex. I'd say a lot of people who cheat are actually too selfish to leave their partner, because honestly their partner would be better off having a chance at love with someone else who would treat them right. As for the 'even if it's just once with one person' comment, you don't know that. Guys who cheat generally keep it from their girlfriends and therefore it's safe to say they don't have a problem with lying. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry if you're the girlfriend in this situation who was just cheated on. You're better off without this guy. And I'm sorry if you know the girlfriend too, but tell her if you do. She deserves more!|`|AA10774810	They're lying about loving their girlfriend.  When you truly love someone, cheating wouldn't even cross your mind.|`|733yHonMaa	i personally believe if a guy cheats on his gf, he never loved her. you dont intentionally hurt people you love & care about- & don't want to lose or disrespect.<br>  <br>  with that being said, they say it b/c...<br>  <br>  they think they have to-- b/c most people are quick to say it in relationships<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  they say it b/c they **think** they love the girl<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  they say it b/c they are jerks & want to benefit from the physical aspect of the relationship.|`|x7uYAPaSaa	Because they are mixing between the girls. There girlfriend has something that the other woman doesnt ect. So if they cheat but still keep there girlfriend, then they are happy|`|RAatxTeSaa	Guys are so RETARDED.... that's why they cheat. LOL but if a guy really loves a girl he wouldn't cheat on her. So if i guy tells a girl he loves her and cheats.. hes a LIAR!
WaYC7W9Haa	The quick answer is: You got serious way to young!!!  Now you've gotten to know you body more and learn a few tricks and hubby is past the experimental faze and probably a simple man.  Either work it out or simply explain that you just don't want to be in this relationship.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|9tTeBy6waa	sounds like both of ya'll have some soul searching to do!! Good luck! Either way follow your Wishing heart|`|KEUFaCkUaa	ya, no way this ends good.  you'll probably try and dump him cuz he sucks and you'll be out with your new guy and your ex will show up and shoot you both.  i can see it now.|`|vIiG3NILaa	This guy is trying to control you with his "love" for you. You need to seriously consider leaving him. He got you young. 25 and 17 is not an acceptable age difference. You got taken advantage of. The times you broke it off with him because you needed to live your own life, he should have gotten the hint that you were too young for him. Every time he says "don't leave me I'm nothing without you" is just him being insecure and not wanting to let you go. You need to see a Theripist and try that but if it doesn't work you need to leave him and be alone, truly alone and find out who you are without someone else. but in my personal opinion, he's a creep. and getting in good with your mom, not a good sign.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Honestly, I think he's being real with you now and seriously making a change for the best. If you don't want him and you want this other man, then you need to end it with your husband BEFORE anything happens with the other man. <br>  <br>  But! Heres the downside ( yes theres usually an up and a down)<br>  Let's say you leave your husband for this other guy, do you realize what's going to happen? Once the newness wares off in the relationship with the new guy you will soon find that you should have stayed with your husband. Because with all the crap the two of you have been through, he's at the point to where he knows if he screws up you are gone for good. But with this new guy, you will only have to deal with a whole new set of issues and problems. <br>  <br>  Don't be a whore and have ANY contact with this man at all while you are still married. That would only make you trailor trash whore, instead if you REALLY need him that bad, divorce and leave your husband first. <br>  <br>  TRUST ME!|`|bO2rzfISaa	I think your husband is obsessive and controlling and chose you at 17 (when he was a grown man) because he thought he could keep you under control.  He's comfortable with cheating and you are too. There's so much wrong here I don't know what to advise. How about counseling?|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	He loves you a whole lot more than you love him. You need to grow up. In fact, the fact that he dotes on you is probably why you don't find hm exciting anymore. Like I said, grow up and see him for who he is.|`|qsLhVZd8aa	The grass is rarely greener on the other side.  Stop talking to this other guy and work on your marriage.|`|94gC814Eaa	He sounds like he is very manipulative and is smothering you, and it sounds like your unhappy, and having been for the most part in your situation and im guessing that you love him and care for him but are no longer in love with him. My advice is leave. You feel like it isn't your life,<br>  and you are lost. I really doubt you will find your happiness being with him cause by now you have found out you could do better as far as finding a happy normal relationship. I don't feel like your giving up at all im sure you have tried seeing as you have been with him since you were 17. You have put years of your life into this, don't waste more being unhappy. Leave<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  also Im sure he will be hard to get rid of I'm sure because of what he did in the past so be ready for that headache|`|AA10248966	Oh my G- You leave this gay ASAp. he is a per vent control freak, and the sweet side is controlled rage waiting to ex[pl ode at yOu and ot could beget physical. end this charade.<br>  Go into hiding somewhere and divorce him.

And, of course, you missed out on all those thrills that present themselves when you're young.<br>  <br>  Let me assure you that what you missed is not what life is all about. Hanging around, dating, having unattached sex, does not offer you contentment. Speak up with your husband and tell him what you want out of life. Listen to him and find out what he expects. Life is difficult enough alone. Sticking it out, the two of you can make it easier to cope with the world.<br>  <br>  Check out my source and find out more about relationships|`|H3WHxCgaaa	You both have some serious fidelity issues.  Seek marital therapy.  Find a good counselor.  When you can't sort it out yourself you have to call in the professionals...|`|LcOPL8gCaa	I think you did get married to early and your not ready for a real commitment.<br>  I believe you should get a counsler. Because if your really in love with him then you'd never think about someother guy right?<br>  I think you guys really need to talk and tell him to quit sucking up. Be serious with him tell him how you feel. Talk about you might get a divorce. I wouldn't trust him, he's talking to other girls, but i wouldn't trust you either.<br>  <br>  So I'm not sure all up to you hunny...<br>  Good luck & best wishes|`|chENztVEaa	Sounds like the two of you have some real trust issues going on with one another.  You said he was a sweet guy but you didn't say whether or not you feel you love him.  If you do love him and you are willing to work on your marriage than you need to communicate and try to build your trust with one another.  You didn't sound like you were really ready to settle down with him to begin with so I am wondering if you honestly love him or just gave in to convenience and his pushy attitude. It sounds to me like he is trying to make some efforts to make things right.  Don't have a child until you have your life and relationship more stable.  You should be enjoying this part of your life to the max and I feel it is early in your marriage to be having this kind of feelings, that is what made me question your love for him from the beginning.  Keep in mind though that sometimes in marriage you have to ride the waves, you are going to have ups and downs, highs and lows, so don't do anything hasty.  Try communicating with one another as much as possible and be honest about your feeliongs and trust issues.  Good Luck!|`|emKXU1QFaa	I can't tell you what to do but it sounds like you knew before you got married that even though he was sweet and safe, etc. you still were not totally in love/committed to him.  I do beg to differ in that he doesn't seem as nice as you think (least on paper).  When you broke up before he stalked you and interfered with your new relationships and now he's doing it again, controlling the situation and not giving you any room.  You need to decide if having a comfortable,safe life is worth it or not.  <br>  <br>  Either way you need to specifically tell him he's smothering you and if he doesn't give you some room he will be forcing you to make a decision to get some room physically.  Ignore him contacting your family that's just another way to keep you, so if you do leave they will give you flack.  However, if you do break it off with him contact them ASAP let them know some of the why's and they are not to give him any info on you.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Therapy, you took your vows so you should honor them and do all you can to make this work, remember how you first felt about eachother and strive to feel that way again, you both need to put the effort in, goodluck.|`|jd5a3Pk5aa	Sounds to me like he may have some guilt of his own he is packing around.  He wants his cake and eat it too, meaning, he wants to do all that mushy stuff with other women and keep you for himself as well.  It honestly sounds to me like neither of you are ready for a lifetime committment.  Too bad this wasn't discussed at more length prior to getting married.  I'm not sure counseling would even help for the both of you have a taste and yearning for the single life.  Above and beyond all...DO NOT HAVE BABIES ANY TIME SOON!  <br>  <br>  If you are that miserable with your marriage, then I would strongly suggest for you to get out.  You might not have all the "niceties" that you have now, but in order to be happy, you hafta take some bad with the good.  Life is too short to live miserably.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, your spouse sounds like he is gonna be the smothering kind.  Crying, begging, pleading, promising you anything and everything your hearts desire if you don't leave him, but in a situtation like this, you will hafta be strong, move forward and not look back.  And keep moving.  If his clinginess persist, what was once between you two can become very bitter.<br>  <br>  Good Luck in whatever you decide to do.|`|yd2SP7d6aa	You are a freaking mess.  You are to much of a wall flower, you have no confidence (insecure), you never learned to stand up on your own and you allowed yourself to marry a cheater and a man that is taking steps to "control" you (by exerting pressure from as many sources as possible, including trying to get your parents to be on HIS side). This is why I shudder everytime some girl (I don't dare say "woman") marries early..they never develop the ability to stand on their own two feet) On top of that, you obviously haven't learned that marital vows should matter, that you shouldn't put yourself in a position where you start thinking of another "man".<br>  <br>  My honest advice is that your marriage is doomed and you should hit the reset button. Afterwards you should AVOID any real relationship with a man for a year or two untell you have rented, payed your bills, went to school, found a better job etc.  Maybe after working at succeeding (instead of riding someone elses coat tails) and being on your own, you will develop some confidence in yourself and realize you don't deserve an idiot for a husband.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Well, if you went to school, got your own job etc. than I still have no idea what the hell happened to you.  You might simply lack common sense as its not to difficult to realize if you are married that you should avoid hanging out with members of the opposite sex (as the "odds" of you developing feelings for said person, especially when your marriage is already struggling, goes up rather dramatically).
BbcBTIrUaa	HEY!!! I DID THE SAME THING!!!!<br>  I already failed though, but I am still keeping it on of course..<br>  <br>  anyways another time I also did this thing where<br>  I wouldnt masturbate for 2 weeks, if I failed I would start all over again<br>  but for three weeks, if I had a wet dream, I would only start all over<br>  again without adding a penalty.<br>  <br>  I went like 4 months trying to accomplish this...<br>  and I finally did it, I realized I had no wet dreams if I slept on a couch.<br>  <br>  you can do it though.. just dont tempt yourself,<br>  there are alot of things out there that you can distract yourself with,<br>  never go ANYWHERE alone!!!, especially to the bathroom!!!<br>  If I am anywhere alone I start getting ideas and become tempted.<br>  If you go to the bathroom, make someone give you a time limit.<br>  <br>  and sleep in the living room, or with other people around.<br>  <br>  and its true, it does get more sensitive and easier for you<br>  to "finish it off" the longer you are with out it, so<br>  the longer you go with out it, the more you have to be careful.<br>  <br>  and dont listen about the build up thing, there are alot of guys who  go asexual, they dont die for not letting their "passions"<br>  out.  your body takes caer of itself.<br>  <br>  I am not giving myself penalty for wet dreams anymore,<br>  so what I do is PRAY TO GOD FOR WET DREAMS!!!|`|uHQmgV9oaa	dude I must say that you are an idiot first off. lol what the hell do you tell people??

2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	1- You should send out your invitations 6-8 weeks before the wedding.  Any sooner and you risk the invitations getting lost on people's kitchen counters and forgotten about.  Any later and you risk the possibility of the guests already having plans for that day.<br>  <br>  2-People will know where you're registered in one of two ways: they will either call up your parents, MOH, bridesmaids, etc. and ask where you are registered, or they will receive the registry info from your MOH and bridesmaids when they send them the bridal shower invitation.  another way they could find out is if you have a wedding website, because it's perfectly acceptable to post registry info on there.<br>  <br>  3- Yes, you must send a stamped, self-addressed RSVP card.  One way to cut down on the expense is to have RSVP postcards instead.  Postcards only need about half as much postage as a regular envelope.<br>  <br>  4- Most bridesmaids assume that they are responsible for the cost of their wedding attire, but if you suspect for any reason that one of them expects you to pay for it, just tactfully let them know that the cost is their responsibility as one of their bridesmaid duties.  (Like you could say, "I picked out this dress because I thought it would be an option that all of the bridesmaids can easily afford.")<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	1- invites should be received by the guests no later than 8 weeks out<br>  2- nah people put registry info in the invites all the time now.  just don't print it on the actual invite.  insert a separate card.<br>  3- very rude not to include a SASE.  also people won't rsvp quickly like you want them to if they have to find an envelope, write it out, find a stamp...people are lazy!  make it idiot proof for them or you'll find yourself making calls a week before the wedding to find out who's coming<br>  4- they should know they are paying for their own gowns but if they've never been in a wedding they may not know the drill.  don't come out and tell them all pushy like, just work it into conversation like, by the way the bridal shop said that your balance is due by X date.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	1. about 2 months<br>  2. word of mouth or you can set up a wedding website (theknot.com has a good one) where you can put that info on the website. put the web address on a separate card and put it with the invites.<br>  3. yes it would be rude<br>  4. usually they do know, but a good way to make sure of this is to ask them what their comfortable price range would be so you have an idea when you are looking for their dresses.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Send out invites 3 months before wedding, I assume you have spread the word by mouth to as many people as you can anyway.<br>  I am in UK so I dont know anything about being registered but if you mean a wedding gift list then its normally mentioned separately with the invitation.<br>  We never sent out RSVP cards but just a phone number as most people said they were coming as soon as they got the invitation.<br>  I bought all 5 of my bridesmaids outfits, my chief bridesmaids, my matron of honour and my ring bearers too.<br>  I dont understand the concept of them buying their own outfit when they are doing something for you, surely its only right to buy for them.|`|BUET39wmaa	I would give people approx. 3 mos notice<br>  <br>  gift registration should be handled by the maid of honour I think<br>  <br>  you should send a self addressed stamped env with invitation unless you leave instruction to call or email their confirmation<br>  <br>  bridesmaids usually buy their own dresses and should know this. you can help the situation by including them in the selection process because it is their money|`|8IA3d3NNaa	1.

Remember, these guests are already responsible for buying a gift, most buy a new outfit ( at least ladies do) and take time to travel for the wedding. You don't want to have to make people find out where the invite goes, buy an envelope, and stamps. I myself, never have stamps in my home unless its around the holidays (for cards) because I never mail anything. PLEASE include a self-addressed envelope with a stamp.<br>  <br>  4- Some bridesmaids might not know, so you could send out a friendly email reminding the ladies of when the dresses need to be bought by. I'm sure you can figure out a clever way to say this so you don't sound rude.|`|YfxydPF5aa	I would send them out at least two months ahead of time, so you can get them back and let your venue know the final count. People will ask where you are registered if they want to give a gift. I don't know about rude, but it would seem like something was missing if you didn't give out envelopes with a stamp. Plus if you give the guests everything they need I think the will be more likely to get the RSVP back in time. Bridesmaids should know, but I would mention it to clear up any confusion.

My guess is guys have flirted with you before but you might not have noticed because you're too busy wondering what you're doing at the time. A little confidence goes a long way.|`|Qe95LNxYaa	how's your hammer hanging?<br>  <br>  been single is so nice i had a girlfriend before and she was totally nuts broke up whit her she did take is so good then i date it a girl for a month she left me now i give up and don't care about it anymore like to stay single nothing to worry about|`|y2nC8BUGaa	because you're shy.<br>  <br>  Talk about anything.

That's so easy. Go online and search for any single men and ask him out for a date.|`|wQZ1ycI6aa	Conversations should be easy with people who know how to listen. In my opinion most of the people want to be listened to, but they don't know how to listen or don't have patience for the people around. A conversation could be started, by relating to a common thing you have with the person beside you. Or simply by making a funny remark. Remember it doesn't need to be something special, just something that enables you to receive some feedback.|`|ERbJbxbDaa	Why don't you have a boyfriend?<br>  <br>  There are two options here:<br>  1. YOU ARE UGLY!  EMBRACE IT!

xwrLADBCaa	It's very easy.  You say "Excuse me, keep your hands to yourself or I may have to break them for you".  She has no right to touch any one.  I don't care what the reason.  You need to speak up and put her in her place.  That's what she needs.  Besides, what does being christian have to do with anything.  If she so christian she wouldn't be acting the tramp she is.|`|1epjqrflaa	Your husband should be the one to say something to her.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	the thought of any woman in her 60s having hots for anyone scares me. <br>  <br>  but then, i think Farrah Fawcett is almost 60.<br>  <br>  she look like her?|`|AA10941788	Wow I can see the jealousy in you big time<br>  Dang get over it........GEESH!!!!|`|PYpQrhYdaa	I don't understand this run-on babble.  Is it a bunch of women or one single woman?|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Each of these "men" need to tell her to keep her hands to herself in a polite but firm manner.  It is OFF the charts rude for her to be doing this.  The men need to say with a smile, "I'm sorry, but I avoid that type of physical contact because it might cause confusion".  If she plays dumb the answer is, "see, one of us is already confused, and I'm not even sure which, and that is why I avoid these situations and need to know that you will respect my wishes".|`|bO2rzfISaa	My experience with the elderly leads me to respect them, not try to change them. Don't you think all these men could address this if they wanted her to stop? She's probably lonely, and she might even have a touch of dementia.

Imw1cGohaa	50/50|`|AA11209233	It's still 50/50.  It doesn't matter what children he or you have had in the past.|`|czvZCbjxaa	The sperm can carry only the X gene or the Y gene. The fact that there were many girls in the line does not mean that you guys are genetically required to have girls. You have an equal chance for a boy and a girl. So just hope you have a boy.
zY8uu241aa	It does sound kind of sketchy, I'll admit, but I don't think you have anything to worry about.  He might have told you there would be other people there so that you wouldn't worry about exactly this.  If you were hanging out alone with a guy who liked you and your boyfriend asked if it was just the two of you, would you make him worried and scared by telling him, "Nope, I'm hanging out with a guy friend of mine who likes me and it's going to be just the two of us alone for a while,"?<br>  <br>  If you're really that worried about it, then just ask if you can join them next time; if he says no, ask why and you can make your judgment off his reason.  If he says yes, you've got nothing to worry about.  I don't think you really have anything to worry about anyway, but hopefully this helps nonetheless.  Good luck!|`|4dXcZhuTaa	no, if you should be worried more will happen, and when/if more happens, you need to break up with him for being an idiot.|`|zGZe0mt8aa	i think you can trust your boyfriend and  you should do some true research before accusing him like that, maybe thee's nothing between them.|`|1UWBjoLgaa	Nothing to worry about|`|4TtPUHwzaa	Even a sheet of paper has two sides.|`|I80ozj3kaa	no not YET|`|xA1fdVimaa	possibly.  if he didn't lie about it, i'd say no.  but he did (of which, he lied either because he didn't want you to feel threatened & jealous, or because he has feelings as well).<br>  <br>  the most likely situation is simple - the rumor that she likes him is true, & he knows this, but is doing his best to "keep the peace."  he isn't trying to hurt you or make you worried, he's just trying to deal with a friend that caught feelings without losing the friendship ... & at the same time making sure he doesn't betray you.<br>  <br>  you're best bet is to call him out on his lie (he definately does not want to get in that habit).  make sure he knows that honesty between the two of you is the most important thing (if either of you stop trusting the other, the relationship isn't going to work).  & after he tells you what's going on, do what you believe is in your best interest (let him handle his business if he's really trying to do the right thing ... or walk away if he's not acting right).<br>  <br>  don't stress ... just take a breath & talk to him :)|`|wu47J6WPaa	I can't say because I don't know your guy's exact relationship; how long you've been together, how close you are, or if he's ever lied to you before. I would just be careful because since she's in an argument with her parents her emotions are obvoiusly shaken and she might be vulnerable and try something.|`|BFmWv4ZUaa	Well,<br>  If she is a real friend you can be sure even if she did like him that nothing would happen.<br>  And if he does really like you he would not cheat.<br>  But hey always check and be sure?<br>  <br>  Just casualy ask him, And if you think he might get mad then ask your friend. <br>  Or if you dont want to ask-Make more effort with your friend see her more. Or see them at the same time.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps. x|`|x9FGHC8Zaa	If your boyfriend is making you worry and is lying to you then you shouldn't be with him. Nobody has a need for someone in there life to do that to them. It is unhealthy for you. You will find someone that treats you better and doesnt put you through that crap.|`|W20KslFzaa	If he lied to you, it's a problem.<br>  He wouldn't lie unless he was doing something he thought was bad enough that he needed to lie about it.  Or unless you're a control/jealous freak that couldn't handle him being alone with another girl.|`|EAYaoG5laa	If he lied about it, possibly. Ask him about it.|`|a2t1hnl6aa	Dude... worry. Why'd he have to lie? Guys lie for a reason..... unless he knew you'd get jealous.|`|JJ16dVgWaa	you shouldnt worry too much if something goes wrong then keep moving in life hes not the only guy out there|`|bM8zIAadaa	well, it's his friend and im sure you have some guy friends ,too so he probably feels the same way if you hang out with them. You should never listen to rumors , ever because they aren't true.<br>  And if he does cheat on you, then he isn't right for you. then you should get someone better. Hope this advice helps, good luck!|`|KKfoCV8vaa	Well you should not get so worried because it can be a sign to him as you don't trust him at all. Which then leads to arguments then you may end up breaking up. So don't get your self so worried about him, just relax and put your trust in him!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|VodSyMZIaa	If he felt compelled to lie you should be wondering why.|`|FiN1V6tOaa	Nuthin to worry about|`|JMkTLs9caa	YUP ........ u got cheated on !!

Have you seen a doctor?  If you smell "fishy" it could indicate an infection called "gardenella", which is a protozoan infection of the vaginal and is sexually transmitted....you and your partner will need to take a medication called "Flagyl" to irradicate it.  <br>  You can also have "Trichomoniasis", "Clamydia", "yeast infection", among others.  All of those have treatments that you and your partner will need to take to get rid of it.  Do not regularly "douche", that wipes out all the "good" vaginal flora and the vagina's nature ability to cleanse itself.  And you can get a "rebound super infection".  The market has all kinds of feminine products....all of which should NOT be used on a regular basis.  Natural odors are the biggest turn on for a man, so don't try and cover up your femininity with those.  But do get checked out by your gynecologist.|`|2b39e12aad73ae2fda69e018286d6baeaa	sounds like he is making excuses,  try some different douches, and perfumes, if nothing changes, dump him.  or get an outside unbiased opinion, have another man smell your hoo hoo, see what he thinks.|`|wJ0iLG0raa	rightfuly he should luv the way u smell.<br>  <br>  the way u are naturally is supposed to be a natural turn on ><<br>  <br>  if he doesnt like it, he possibly never will.<br>  <br>  an idea is to get a wipe, buy musk, spray/drop some on2 the cloth/wipe& wipe ur area with it right after u shower;)|`|uNdculYPaa	try using some Feminine products . you can get it in the drug store|`|jBigEy0Caa	Regular bathing<br>  <br>  Edit - Wow you're 17 and married, kinda young ya think?|`|VuUz8NgKaa	Wash it.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Take a bath; wash yourself!|`|wwB3csfYaa	Bleach|`|9Xcpqvl8aa	You have to wash frequently or at least use a feminine wipes every after you pee.

Female should always have hygine esp. down there.|`|oML597wvaa	you should probably ask your doctor, unlike these other punks I am not going to immediatly assume you are a dirty girl. I am however going to assume your hubby is a dirty guy. Make sure he washes is ding-a-ling and surrounding area thouraghly before intimacy, (and his teeth and mouth if thats ever used.)

Not everything is his fault.  You need to ask yourself why you did all of this to yourself.  You stated he didn't have a job but you let him move in anyway.  You did that and you can break that.  Why stay with this guy.  Let him find someone else he can mooch off of.  Stop being a doormat and stop acting like a victim.  Leave him you are unhappy.|`|7c7e7239a13fa3735f761565b7230571aa	no he prolly wont change and he will end up being a very lonely and bitter man; you did the right thing getting out of there because you know what?...............you deserve better than that.

YOU ARE NOT THE BAD GUY, THAT WAS HIS WAY OF MANIPULATING YOU.<br>  <br>  You did not enjoy the sex you said it yourself, he never made love, he just used you to release himself.   I say getting him out your life was the best thing you could have done.  Congratulate yourself for not ending up having a baby and getting married to this leach.  Go do some things that make you feel good about yourself, start working out, take a class, pamper yourself you deserve it.

You are going to make a GREAT (not shitty) guy happy. This man used you. I know this because my dad did the same things to countless women. You're not missing out on anything with him or his daughter. You feel bad because you wanted to change him and couldn't. Its not your fault. You can't make a man be a man if he doesn't want to. He'll always be a little boy until he sees how awful he is.|`|6Sln5Tbmaa	You probably feel that way for the same reason that you let his broke unemployed @$$ move in with you.  Because you liked, or even loved him.  It happens to the best of us.  I think because the bad choices you made to be involved with this person, it turned out being bad for you, hence you were the "bad guy".  But you are smart, and you got  away from it.  Just continue to be smart and stay away from him.  Use this as an example as to why you should stay away from guys like him in the future.  It is just as important to follow your mind (which it does seem like you have one) as it is to follow your heart.  Let the two of them communicate sometimes.

AA11621397	Ask her why she is always accussing you of being 'jealous' of everyone, tell her to quit it and that probably she is jealous of everyone and just shifts the blame to you!|`|AA10421757	Stop telling her stuff. She is probably saying you are jealous of someone because you are hating on someone all the time so she knows too much of her business. If that's the case then stop telling her stuff.

AA10677333	Put it this way, you should just care as much as people appreciate. <br>  <br>  You have your opinion and you have expressed it. It is up to her to decide. After all, it is her life. As long as she does not do anything to affect your life, I said just leave them where they are :)|`|v398Qalyaa	she is being totally two faced, i would find it difficilt to remain friends with her, if that was me i'd tell her i couldn't be friends with her while she is totally taking the pee like this|`|gCdP3NJGaa	Hmm. The danger is if you blow the whistle on them you run the risk of them blaming you- the 2 doing the dirty for being caught out and the innocent g/f because you were the one who wrecked her life ( you haven't, the other 2 have, but that's how she'll probably see it). Your friend is being nasty to you because she knows you're right but doesn't want to hear it.<br>  Tell the 2 they have a week to either end it or come clean to the g/f, otherwise you'll do it. By giving them the chance to do it, if you then have to tell her you can say you tried to stay out of it but you couldn't stand back and see them make a fool of her. She'll be hurt but not by your actions. <br>  As for your 'friend' doing the dirty- would you still call her a friend? If she could do that to one friend she could do it to you as well. Ditch her quick!<br>  And as to why should you do it- in the g/f position, would you want a friend to keep quiet or to tell you? I personally would rather know, but it's about how you define friendship, I suppose|`|KHsWu1zbaa	yeah seriously, this (bad word) of a girl needs to get her ego in check. She's really NOT that hot sh*t. That's disgusting, she's a whore, and the fact she thinks it's perfectly acceptable for her to be sleeping with the boyfriend of her FRIEND? Clearly she doesn't know what a friend is. <br>  <br>  And i'm sure if there were some skank doing this to HER behind her back, she wouldn't be too happy about it.<br>  <br>  Tell your friend. You'll have a better relationship with her in the end and you can kick this nasty girl to the curb.|`|ISnJu0W3aa	it shouldnt come from you but if she finds out its happening and that you knew about it shes gonna hate you as much as the other girl. to her it will seem like you are in on it and making a fool out of her. not fair i know but thats the way it will go.<br>  <br>  tell the boyfriend you know whats going on and if he doesnt tell her within a week you are going to have to tell her yourself. she deserves to know and it should be her bf who 'fesses up. but if he refuses you need to step up. its the only fair way to her|`|CUc2gqzjaa	just bounce|`|sCr2iTczaa	Honey if she finds out and finds out you knew and didn't tell her she might be mad.... I would just stop associating with the girl who is the home wrecker though, i'm not trying to say anything mean but a lot of people say you are who you hang out with and it is true your friends ways could rub off of you and she doesn't sound like a very good friend. If you care about your friend you would let her know what is going on. I know you probably don't want to get in the middle of it and start anything no one does.

Obviously your friend doesn't care about other peoples feelings.  Give her a wide berth.  I would find it very hard to to trust her in the future.  As for your other friend, how close are you?  Will it affect your relationship if she finds out that you knew and didn't tel her?  As I said its a tough situation, but only you can really answer that.  Let your conscience guide you.|`|Ok4lJYVYaa	You don't need friends like her. If I was you I would tell the girlfriend, and hope she believes me over them.

f883ee7d57e2525418837ade51f4e9cbaa	I'm not a chick, but I've dealt with enough women to know where this is going. Buddy, let me tell you something that took me a while to learn: women know if they're going to sleep with you within FIVE MINUTES of meeting you. If you're not on the list right away, you're NEVER going to be on the list. Women are creatures that work heavily on feeling and emotion (they like to label it as "chemistry," but the effect is the same), so if you don't get those juices flowing right away, they never will.<br>  <br>  Sorry to be the bearer of bad news. But at least you can stop wasting your life on some chick who is never going to return the feeling.|`|AA11961366	You've already seen her lack of commitment. Give her lots of space, and if she really wants you, you'll see it. If you're looking for commitment, you should probably move on - it sounds like this girl has issues, that you can do nothing about. We all have insecurities, some people deal with them differently. It sounds like hers are affecting you.|`|0505c285673953f330355da1912cbfd2aa	well SHE DON'T LIKE YOU ahem she doesn't like you man. move on|`|0f751e38e7ae86d898105d238c37bf34aa	go for it. u'll never know if u don't try.|`|1818c9fa88b86ca1920e063c3902f68caa	I think she may be in doubts about her feelings towards you. If she doesn't want to commit herself to you, forget her. I think when someone loves another there is no place for insecurities. Women like to have boys around interested in them, because they feel special, you know? But she doesn't love you. Good luck!|`|3a854799a9fcbb0723ed83440d9b0838aa	1. She ain't gonna commit.<br>  2. You are her back-up plan. You're not a bad boy, are you? You have a job, don't you?<br>  3. Tell her you're not an emotional tampon, and tell her to **** off.<br>  4. Go here: www.mgtow.com<br>  5. Unplug.|`|442ed6b211a99a09ce2888a279ad50d8aa	This is standard female behaviour towards someone on the "friends" ladder.  Read up on "ladder theory".  She doesn't LIKE you.

Incidentally, how many years have you wasted on this girl?  Too many is the answer.  You can try to keep going, but doing what miss Krissy Hip says will get you a sexual assault charge real quick.|`|61279e93ca32438e2e8ea321d20423eaaa	wow... insecurities are hard to deal with. plus the fact that she sounds possessive. thats not really the kind of girlfriend you'd want to be with coz otherwise, you'll just end up arguing and fighting everyday.. and thats a lot of drama to deal with. tell her exactly how ur feeling and if you think that its just not getting any better, then as much as it would hurt, let her go. coz lets be true, the longer u keep her, the more u hurt urself.. i wish u all the best|`|a383cf5e2732f4d3c9cce99d8dd8fdd5aa	im sorry to say this but she probably likes you but just not enough to commit. you should try playing hard to get (stop calling, make yourself busy) and see how she reacts to that. chances are she'll want you more.|`|a8678471a964971f2367173074ad3482aa	Maybe it's time to step away and stop bugging her about it. As you already know women are very indecisive. We are that way because we don't want to end up with someone that is going to do us wrong!
5bacc1cc323e2eb4efa28841684b64e1aa	She's got some serious emotional scars, probably something that happened to her as a child that she hasn't coped with.  It prevents her from getting too close to others for fear of being hurt or abandoned, so she detaches before she gets attached.  It's great that you care about her, but if she's not ready to face her pain and work through it there's not much you can do to help.  This is something she has to do herself.  Tell her that and that you're willing to help, but if she's not willing then you need to restrict this relationship to that of an acquaintance and not get emotionally involved.|`|a1b7d4998562e5b5759a4a2fb2de9472aa	sounds like my ex, the closer she gets to you the more she is scared that your going to leave her.

And at the end of the day, either you address the problem and try to resolve it or you continue to let it upset you..|`|0b635848858188e9ee8e14a3e3f8e5deaa	My advice is to move out. Give her a good amount of time to find someone else to take your place. If she asks why you are moving, tell her that you do not feel that you are able to live together and that since you value your friendship so much, you would hate to see the currant living arrangement destroy that. <br>  <br>  Roomates can be great or they can be a nightmare!

e5e0eb2da447881324c0472cc3164236aa	Being in a marriage does not mean you have to like all the same things and do all the same things, but if you don't, you need to make sure you are both considerate of things that the other one likes. If he does the things you like to do simply because he knows you like them, and if you do the same for him, it shouldn't be a big deal. If you are different, that is ok, but your differences in personality should compliment the other one. My husband and I have totally different personalities, I am way too trusting and very outgoing, he is overly cautious about people and is more introverted. But our differences balance each other, when I am about to do something stupid because I trust someone, he reminds me of what could happen and I re-think it and make a more informed decision. Differences are good sometimes, as long as they don't turn out to be a constant battle and as long as you have fun together, trust each other and can communicate. Good luck, he sounds like a good guy!|`|54b6847dc9b6ad83a06dc8a99f68325eaa	I think you are just having cold feet. You love him so just go for it, he seems nice. Good luck sweety. Hope it turns out great.|`|8d98cd80effaca29984916124fa7cbdbaa	u've been with him for 2yrs so that says a lot..n more over he gets along nicely wid ur kid. sometimes we r looking for qualities in our partner that we dont have...so may be marryin cud b the best thing for both of u...just be positive about this n all the best.|`|bb62f8ae89d440897b0ebc89430b4b3faa	You found a man to accept you and all of the things that make you-you.  Me and my husband do not have the same taste in music or other stuff like you and your fiance but if he was interested in everything I do or did or watch or listen to damn that would be boring.  We have been together for 51/2 years and married for 3 on Wednesday and his differences and mine are what keep it interesting.  I think it is awesome that he will go and do the things you like for you.  You should worry when he wont do those things even for you.  It is also awesome that he is good with your child.  If he wasn't I would run the other way.  If your differences haven't ended your relationship so far how would they ruin it when your married.  You both have a chance to learn about each other and what makes each other tick and celebrate that.  Would you really want to spend the rest of your life with a mirror image or with someone who makes it interesting?  I think you are having cold feet and there is nothing wrong with that.  You wouldn't be human if you weren't.  It sounds like you found a man who loves you unconditionally and that is awesome.   Good luck in life and your marriage and celebrate the differences.|`|c33be93c55f9feb30616065bb8df29c4aa	yes, you are|`|e215d38688bb60aeda81bda2d1eaa985aa	I was in the exact same situation, minus the kid, and I had the same kind of thoughts. I wasn't sure if I was marrying him because I really loved him, or just because he took care of the basics. Different interests don't matter as long as the common belief is that you two love each other unconditionally. You don't have to like the same music, or enjoy doing the same activities. Believe me, you will both learn to meet in the middle. Show him you are willing to try doing what he likes and at some point, he'll do the same. I watch football with my husband, and he'll sit in on shows like America's Next Top Model, just to be with me. Find a middle ground, and trust your heart! Good luck!|`|9e2130ec276925af9eb23573fa721694aa	Look at the differences, and ask yourself - can I live with all of this for the rest of my life? The main thing is not the differences themselves, but to realize that things will not change after you two are married. If you are ok with the way he is, and can accept his ways - and he can do the same for you - then there isn't much to worry about. I think, the greatest problems arise when people try to change each other to suit their idea of perfection. Acceptance is key.|`|84e39878c78991cb562d7674cf145cbfaa	Take a close look at the opposites that you are concerned about.  If its only a  matter of music then there is no concern.  And being a bit of a  home body is not all bad as long as its not a total thing.  If he goes out with you for you but still has a good time then it dont seem so bad.  Best thing to do is discuss your concerns with him.  The best of marriages come with open communications and by sharing your concerns you will only make your marriage stronger.  Good Luck!|`|0b635848858188e9ee8e14a3e3f8e5deaa	You're cute! My husband and I have a lot of differences as well and it worked out great! Find things that you have in common. My husband and I like to paint and play Mario Party. :) We have also read a few marriage books together which have helped me understand why my guy isn't into cuddling and it explained to him why it is so important to women. It doesn't sound like you have anything to worry about. If you are getting stressed out, talk to your guy about it. It's going to really start getting stressful in about 3-4 months...make sure that you are communicating with him then too. :)<br>  Congrats!|`|37dc7f19fb27ec91e25f9c39591d089daa	Just remember the reasons u love him!<br>  He obviously loves you because believe me he would not do all of this if he was not truly in love with u!|`|9a1eb97689a998e5c4bdd3b7fcbea028aa	I think you have nothing to worry about it. He sounds like a great guy. He loves you ALOT!!!! good Luck and wish you both the very best.|`|AA11204355	me and  my fiancee are opposites as well. it makes things interesting believe me. ur better off with him than someone just like you. that gets boring. It can be a challenge sometimes because we dont think the same but ultimately I know how much he cares because he is willing to adjust to someone so different. it lets me know that he is completely invested in the relationship. with time and compromise your relationship will be totally harmonious. ...just sounds like cold feet.

It may seem hard to believe sometimes, but guys don't like total airheads.  It sounds like this guy wants to talk to you about more than homework since he gave you his number and talks to you on AIM. I recommend calling him and talking about a class question, then move on to what you think of the class and teacher. then transition into something that doesn't have to do with class and see if the conversation keeps going. if it does, you're well on your way to building a great friendship and probably more. I had a similar experience last year when a guy I thought was just a friend kept asking me questions about the class but was actually flirting with me. so don't be afraid to be yourself out there. if you become comfortable with telling things to each other, he'll tell you how he feels about you himself.|`|4b72166a368fc2c1b1d35fc4a0f3b3b9aa	It means he is interested in you, it could be he does not what else to say s he is helping you woth home work, well, he may be nice.|`|56edbe67de90187274eff9c0ddc7ce46aa	it means that he really likes u and want u to give him a chance <br>  if u don't like him fust tell him that nd I think he'll stop bothering u <br>  GOOD LUCK <br>  ......... , . - . - , _ , ....... <br>  ......... ) ` - . .> ' `( ....... <br>  ........ / . . . .`.. . . .. ........ <br>  ........ |. . . . . |. . .| ......... <br>  ......... .. . . . ./ . ./ ........... <br>  ........... `=(.. /.=` ........... <br>  ............. `-;`.-' ............. <br>  ............... `)| ... , ......... <br>  ................. || _.-'| .......... <br>  ............. , _|| .._, / ......... <br>  ....... , ..... ..|| .' .............. <br>  .... |.. |.. , . ||/ ............... <br>  , ....` | /|., |Y.., ........... <br>  ...

If the other person is really hurting by your actions then stop it. Quite a bit of manslaughter cases have occured as a result of this because the person being teased sometimes lose control and retaliate. The flip side to that is the teased person sometimes feel helpless and commits suicide. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you is a fair and appropriate way to live. There are much more fun ways to live ones life.

If you can tell me more details like how she acts when you talk to her I'll be able to help you out more...|`|AA0MuMt3aa	Try writing her a little note then leave it in her locker with your number or something. Or, when you're alone, write a note, then give it to her, and wait for her to read it and say something if you can't say it out loud. Otherwise, you're just going to have to pluck up the courage and just be yourself around her. Pretend she's one of your mates, and if that doesn't work then just ask "What's the worst that could happen?" The worst is she just goes away and thinks you're a bit weird, or she doesn't reply to the note, but if she has a problem with you being yourself, then you wouldn't really want to be with her anyway, and she's not worth it, so then just move on and carry on normally with life.<br>  Good luck!|`|ZyWMPooJaa	me too, i know that and i know how to deal with it. first talk about things related to class/work then start talking about things she likes and then youll be quite comfortable talking to her. she'll feel same but dont over do it. take it slow and dont be nervous. good luck.|`|oOKsI0QSaa	same thing here. i felt like a complete idiot whenever i was around him. id start babbling or couldn't speak at all.

AA12142492	You obviously really like this girl, and if you want her back you should tell her. The worst she can say is 'no' but if you never ask her you will never know. I really think you should try talking to her. Be completly honest, first of all ask if you can talk to her for a bit and then explain to her your reasons for why you broke up with her and how you have changed your mind and you would like to go out with her again, say things like she has a really good sense of humor and a great personality. Complement her but don't over do it because she will know you are being false. Hopefully she will listen to what you have to say and reconsider going out with you again. If not, don't worry, try and stay friends with her, tell her you want to be friends. Most importantly, tell her how you feel, if you don't, you will never know her response.

336dcd6064130830c2bb5a690642e887aa	The first thing that comes to mind is playing him a game of strip poker. I'm sure he would really like that. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what your budget is, but Card Player runs special cruises so many times a year for poker players. The next one is the caribbean, so that might be a nice trip for you too. Check out their site at <a href="http://www.cardplayercruises.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.cardplayercruises.com/.</a><br>  <br>  I have found lots of really cool poker stuff on ebay. I just bought a deck of cards that were owned by an ex vice president from their recently. I have also found lots of other cool poker stuff there like old west pics of poker players and antique poker chips and old west style cards. <br>  <br>  Amazon.com has lots of poker t-shirts, poker tables, fold out poker tables, poker books, poker videos, poker glasses. <br>  <br>  He might get a kick out of getting Greg Raymer's lizard type glasses. Search for them on e-bay. They make great poker eye glasses. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure how big he his on reading, but if he doesn't own "The Theory of Poker" by David Sklansky then make sure he gets a copy. It might really help his play if he hasn't ever read it.<br>  <br>  You could open him up an online poker account if he doesn't have any. He might enjoy that. Paradise Poker is one of the more classier places. Also Party Poker or Poker Stars would also be great choices. <br>  <br>  A great educational DVD for poker is "The 2004 World Poker Players Conference". I have watched many poker DVD's. This is one of the few where you can actually get some pretty cool information and advice.<br>  <br>  You could also get him a poker magazine subscription. That's the sort of gift that will keep on giving for a while. Those are the kind I like to give. Card Player runs probably the best poker magazine. They have been around longer than all the other major poker magazines in publication today. <br>  <br>  I hoped this has helped in some way. I'm confident that you will find something that your husband will really like very much. Happy Anniversary to you both.|`|e108ee963f30e687ab8fcc68edbc419eaa	Get him a fold out poker table.|`|AA11465145	Does he have a poker table? Or how about some poker shot glasses? <br>  <br>  P.S. I admire that you are very supportive of your husband's hobby. My boyfriend is addicted and it is very annoying. LOL|`|d01dd9a78aa4d95cb05ccdad1e898534aa	i have seen some really nice gifts at the mall, that is Poker themed.  look for something he doesn't already have, or can replace what he does, or buy him a whole set of items and put it in a gift basket.  he will be so happy and appreciative that you are so thoughtful of his hobbies.
mvKDbb2uaa	Okay.  <br>  <br>  Just let it go.  It's been agreed that the baby is not going to the wedding at all.  Your fiance's sister, who is in the wedding party, will be there for the whole thing and that should be enough.  You don't need your BIL there for the whole thing.  What you need to understand is that not everyone goes to the ceremony anyway.  If your BIL wants to be like that, then let him...he's not really proving much of a point to be honest with you by not going to the ceremony.  Leave it as it is and don't bother giving him the attention because then you're just making the situation worse.|`|nqINitkmaa	I understand why people don't allow children to be at ceremonies or receptions, but if the mother of the child is in the bridal party then you should let them come, you are requesting his sister to be there that day, you are being unreasonable not letting the child come. I can understand not letting other children be there, but its his nephew, and his mother is standing up in the wedding. You are the one being a baby about it.|`|AA11328507	Uh are you just venting or did I miss the question?  In any event, its YOUR day and it should be YOUR way. G'luck!|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	Oh for GOODNESS SAKE!   You are pertpetuating the drama by making it a big deal.  Get over yourself and stop being a freaking Bridezilla.  If it's immediate family... as in the Groom's nephew... then you are a jerk for making it a huge deal.  Execeptions are made to the "no kid" rule for immediate family all the time.  Quit your whining.|`|e944de21d2b8be3991f127b78c28319daa	To make such a big deal about it is rather ridiculous, it's not as if you are singling the kid out.  All I can say is I hope in the months to come that they/he will come to his senses.  The kid would probably have a miserable time at the ceremony anyway, or at the very least he won't know the difference.  It's not like he would remember going (kinda like those parents who shell out tons of $$$ to take their 1-year-old to Disneyland...).<br>  <br>  Hopefully it all works out.  The wedding is a ways off so hopefully he'll cool down, if you feel so strongly about it then you were right to put your foot down.|`|uoCq9B7yaa	Sorry, but I agree with you.  It's your wedding.  I can see a baby coming to the service (IF they have a crying room).  I have kids and they are a distraction for all involved, especially when they get tired.  Besides, when it comes to the reception would they take a baby to a bar??!!!  I would just ignore the whole thing.  You have enough on your plate to be worrying about them.  Adults only shouldn't be a problem.|`|Q8XhdOPkaa	Um, Bridezilla?<br>  <br>  You do realize that the baby is going to be part of your extended family once you're married. And the child is a 1 1/2 years old.|`|bES0ltC8aa	what???|`|172ce5768d6da3a331db950080899378aa	You are being ridiculous! Why are you making this big of a deal out of it? You are going to let his entire family get upset and cause a problem because of your fiances nephew!? Its fine not to have children there, but one child that is your fiances nephew and has a mother for a bridesmaid should be allowed to be there. Quit being so difficult and just let the kid come there!|`|AA11065140	Seriously?  They can't just get a sitter for the evening?  Honestly, they're acting like babies themselves.  Welcome to it...sometimes, having a kid is just not convenient.<br>  <br>  And anyone who can't simply realize that this is how you want your wedding simply shouldn't come - to the ceremony or the reception.  The point of having guests there is to give the guests a chance to tell the bride and groom how happy they are for them...if that's not why they're coming, then they should stay home.<br>  <br>  And the nerve of some people!  If he's going to come for a part of it, but not all of it, the part to attend is the ceremony...coming for the only reception just says, "I don't care about your important event, I'm only here for the free food."<br>  <br>  I firmly believe that your fiance should confront him...in a rational, adult manner.  He should express his disappointment, and reiterate that it's not a personal choice against him or the baby, since you clearly are not allowing anyone to bring kids.<br>  <br>  And for what it's worth, you're not nearly the first, nor nearly the last to decide that children shouldn't be included.  It is very, very, very common for weddings to be adult-only events.  As a matter of fact, many of us who have children prefer to get sitters for this type of event even if the kids are invited, just for a bit of adult fun!<br>  <br>  I'd also venture to guess that things will change by the time the wedding comes around.  In another few months, they'll probably be begging for a chance to get away for an evening alone!

I have 1 friend who will dump a girl if she asks him to go out 2 saturdays on the run as he s scared it is becoming a routine!<br>  <br>  It doesnt mean he isnt crazy for you, from what you have said I would say he thinks you are amazing and really loves you. its just he may be the type of guy who is terrified of even the hint of committment.<br>  <br>  So I would say well it depends on your age - if you are 16 and dont want to marry until you are 28 then just have fun and I guarantee he loves you.  If you are 29 and you want to be married already then he could take a year or a few years to get used to the idea.. but dont worry he definitley loves you.|`|8cce8e167fe7b8b69add68098233fcd8aa	dont worry about it he obviously really really likes you and you should enjoy that just leave it for now and see where trhings go but it sound like your a lucky girl to find someone like that
f06Sy0dfaa	Stop waiting for him to make a move and let him know that you like him. You better snatch him up before someone else does. Some guys are too shy and don't know if the girl is intrested unless she lets him know. I made the first move with my bf... and we've been together 3 years now. Maybe ask him to hang out with you on the weekend and then tell him that you like him.. more than a friend. :)<br>  From what I read he is waiting for a signal from you.|`|7TvYrN3Paa	your not in love but you sure like this guy lot. Love is a word that you will know the meaning to when you fine it. I can't really help you with the whole crush relationship but if one of you doesn't take the first move this whole crush relationship is going to get old fast.|`|WW2JKr0Yaa	Yes I think it's love, the two of you need to go out some where it is just the two of you, the  movies, dinner, the mall, walking through the town. Talk about things and get away from the friend scene so that you two can talk and do your thing and not have to worry about anything else or anyones reaction.|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Yes you're in love or close to it! The only way to improve this relationship is to start hinting that you're free on Friday night and oh do you like to IM or text? Then when he answers ask him if he ever wants to chat he can have your number.<br>  <br>  Just talk to him and when he stares at you stare back; then ask him how he's doing. Just start making yourself available; he sounds dreamy!

SXS2Gf72aa	I was thinking he may like you at first (because the whole nicely making fun of a girl thing tends to mean he likes her) but then I realized definitely NOT. He's just using you and you need to realize that instead of worrying about looking good for him. That right there makes me wonder if you're just wanting him to use you.<br>  He doesn't like you (in a wanting relationship kind of way) because he got a coworker to ask you out, he still hasn't given you him number, and he's been gone for four months without contact, I assume.<br>  And you letting him finger you just puts in his head that you're EASY. So why would he want a relationship if he thinks he can easily get in your pants?|`|8f6fff32b0caffa89ef6b762f487ae26aa	You sound young and he sounds married or with someone.

Don't let him take advantage of you.|`|mfh8ySOgaa	um his answer would be, im getting lucky tonight?<br>  <br>  seriously, are you really asking "do you think he likes me?" .. yeah i think he likes to mess with your head and you fall for it. hes a coward man whore. and that's all he wants. but im assuming you dont mind?? since you do it every time....|`|p5VKqKU7aa	i think he likes you sexually no offense!|`|ERziXzdAaa	he fingered you and your asking does he like?<br>  whore!!|`|TqOsXq8Oaa	you should just forget about him and move on and met new people|`|cHhmnwe8aa	I don't think he knows what he is doing!

Vibrators are very popular nowadays with women.Lots of women have toys in the bedroom.It is just added pleasure and excitement.You have to go with the flow.You will soon find out exactly all the things you can do with one!! It spices up a relationship,it adds to the pleasure.Relax into it,you will have so much fun.It is nothing to do with your performance,women just like to try things out.Your wife just wants to spice things up!<br>  Once married it is very easy to let things go stale,you are very lucky to have a wife who wants to experiment.
79631809ef9f21bf17b3d211b5b710a0aa	Trust me when I say I speak with experience... if you truly want this relationship to work you can't have any other foundation than total honesty... better to be honest now then to have this come back to haunt you later...|`|AA12263940	I am going to tell you honesty is the best policy! Tell him now. if he finds out later from someone else then he will probably be very mad an up set. You could lose him all over again. I doubt you really want to do that.Tell him and let the chips fall and see how you two end up now instead of later because the longer you wait the harder it is and the worse it is going to get. Good Luck!|`|AA11507482	Ok before me 3 ladies have given there opinion. I agree with number 1 and 3|`|AA11636874	If you're never going to see this other guy again, don't say a thing!  You didn't cheat!  Your fiance dumped you!  I have learned the hard way that sometimes to much honesty is a bad thing!  Would your fiance tell you if he did the same?  Think about it!  You did nothing wrong and you shouldn't worry.  Besides, your fiance could use this information against you in the future!  Be strong and keep quite!  Good Luck!

bb6fb7d9b1792cfc88ed667c55cab4b8aa	I can not think of any reason he would feel he would have to do that unless he is doing some thing bad.But do not assume that, first just talk to him. If my hubby was doing that every night I would just ask him why he feels he needs to erase the history.<br>   Is porn something you think he could be getting embarrassed about, that he would feel he needs to hide it from you?<br>   Why would it have to be a fight? I ask my hubby thing normal just as we are going to sleep ( do not know if this is the best time, but it works for me) and we just talk about what ever it is.<br>  <br>   But what I get for what you are saying IS YOU NEED TO TALK before you build it up to something so much bigger then it may need to be.|`|JgvQDjf2aa	If he knows that it would bother you or upset you that he's looking that's probably why he's erasing the history. Guys look at it, my husband will and at first I was suspicious like you until we talked about it. When you might not look as good as the girls he's eying up on the screen we can get self conscious and a little or alot defensive, and I understand The allure of perfect bodies. I love my husband and would never trade him buuuuut if he had a tight ab more muscular body that was less hairy I wouldn't complain lol. We can all fantasize as long as that is where it stays. Tell him that hiding the fact that he is looking at it is not looking good on his part and ask him not to be so secretive. Try watching with him this could really make things interesting, or try sending a little porn to him yourself via text and video messaging. We women exude sexuality no matter what we look like as long as you can find confidence in yourself and you might find he enjoys the flesh and blood woman in front of him more than the over inflated breasty bimbos on the screen :)|`|ghHpGlVDaa	Umm you will have to bring up your concern, as this is affecting your relationship with him.  Marriage is about being open, honest and transparent, and you can share anything with each other.  It's a worry if he is being secretive and hiding what he's doing, and also taking away time which he could be spending with his wife.|`|AA12037013	From experience.<br>  <br>  The time your husband is on the computer and away from you is not nurturing your relationship. Whatever he is doing so late on the computer is what he is letting interfere with the relationship.<br>  <br>  It is surely porn or communicating with another woman.!!!<br>  <br>  You seriously need to bring it up. If there is nothing to hide then why erase???|`|0WstfAmzaa	Just talk to him about it..<br>  I know it's the most cliche' advice, but trust me, I know from experience.  Tell him how you're feeling - make it about your feelings and not what he may or may not be doing.. He'll either be honest with you, or he'll lie, but at least you know that he's 100% clear of your feelings on the matter.  And once you've talked to him about it, let it go.  He knows how you feel, so he'll do the right thing.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	I am the administrator on the computer and we do have parental control reports...if I was that concerned I'd actually look at the report on his usage...<br>  <br>  Before you have to go to those lengths - have you asked him what he's doing and why he's erasing the history?  Maybe it's porn and he feels you'll freak out...maybe it's something more (I hope not).  You won't know until you ask!|`|CF1R0TPvaa	I stay up every night looking at porn, and I erase my history.

You should talk to him about it.|`|ZEitfScGaa	You need to talk to him and ask him what he is doing. He is obviously hiding something.|`|LNSiLxlBaa	He's looking at porn or chatting with other women. Hate to break it to ya.|`|52b0f62af53dd437245aea3bc2df6601aa	Does he have trouble getting up in the morning to go to work and/or is his job performance suffering because he is too tired due to being up late?<br>  <br>  If so, I have a HUGE problem with him being up late.  I don't care what he looks at and I don't care if he deletes his history (not like I check anyway), but what I DO care about is his ability to function in life.  If anything (porn, drugs, games, reading, writing, sticking pennies up his nose, etc.) interfered w/ his ability to participate and be successful in life actives I would be all over him in a minute to help him get his life back on track.<br>  <br>  If not, then I can't even begin to care.<br>  <br>  edit - I would like to mention that my history clears itself every time I exit the browser.|`|Deb4iqbvaa	I'd get a computer program that allows you to see what sites he's going on, then install it when he's not home.<br>  <br>  While I agree that looking at porn isn't a big deal, it could be more and that could be why he's ereasing the history. Plus he does it when you're asleep, so that worries me. <br>  <br>  I hate to put the idea in your head, but he could be watching an actual woman via a live web cam. There are sites where you tell the woman what to do to herself sexually and she does it; most of them are paying sites. Some people are addicted to porn like gambling and it could cost a lot of money like gambling. And if he's watching an actual woman, its not the same as some cheesy film. I'd actually consider it to be cheating.|`|XYHbte2maa	Unless you have reason to believe he's into some other devious activity(which it doesn't seem like you do) he probably is looking at porn. And just doesn't feel like discussing it with you or having you stumble on to the stuff he's been looking at. If he is, it's possible he isn't getting everything he needs from you sexually, or who knows, maybe he just really likes porn.<br>  If it's really bothering you, you should bring it up. Maybe since you guys have joked on this subject before you can bring it up in a joking manner? No matter what, nothing really good can come from secrets in a relationship.<br>  <br>  Oh, and definitely do not listen to anyone about keylogging and spying on your husband to find out what he's up to. Even if he is doing something you're disagreeing with, you would be killing his trust in you.|`|oML597wvaa	No, don't let it go, don't let it fester either. Tell your husband how you feel and what your fears are as to what he may be doing. Tell him that you are not willing to be replaced by porn. My first Marriage had to be ended ver abruptly because a secret porn habbit turned into an HPV. Thats right my hubby started with fantasy and moved on to full out cheating, all because I was unable to put my foot down in the very begining.|`|YBwJvDUEaa	How good of a relationship could you have if he's spending late nights on the computer and covering his tracks. I can't see how sharing your concerns with him would start a fight unless he has something to hide. If it is innocent then he will do whatever it takes to ease your concerns.|`|pVBH6iCYaa	i clear the history on my PC because i don't want my wife finding out that i still like radio control cars and toy trains. <br>  <br>  lol.|`|AA11210211	I would sit down and talk to him,tell him how you feel and ask him what he is doing.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	After 20 years of faithful marriage this is my suggestion:  <br>  - Tell him the ground rules<br>  - Give him some space<br>  <br>  Rules:<br>  1. NO interaction with live/real women.  Watching a video is passive, "chatting with/emailing" real people is different and sometimes leads to something.  <br>  2. NO substituting computer stuff for real world intimacy.  If he is doing this IN ADDITION to a great sex life with you ok.  If this is INSTEAD of, than you need to find out how to make your sex life the incredible part of his life that it should be.  <br>  3. As for him denying it.  I would just say:  Then lets put the computer somewhere in the open, so when I walk around I can see whats going on, if you have nothing to hide then you won't be secretive.  Otherwise lets agree to the ground rules.|`|m8UEGUaGaa	He definitely has something to hide. Porn is likely the reason. If this is a shared family computer then it is a good idea that he delete the history. Don't be afraid to ask "your husband" what he's looking at or deleting. Why don't you just walk in the computer room/office one evening when he thinks you've gone to bed? If your afraid to get answers from your husband then yes, it's time to let go.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Your husband could be looking at porn or he may be having an on line affair (No sex involved obviously). Either way, he is providing something that he feels the need to have. Porn can become addicting. That would be my biggest concern. I do not have enough knowledge to advise you....so would suggest you see a counselor on your own. They could probably do a better job that I can.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	You should not let it go. Either he is addicted to porn or he chatting with other women/men. You should stay with him one night and try to find out. He needs professional help if he is into porn even after being married. If he is into other women or men then you need to take some drastic steps.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Its probably just porn and that is why he is ignoring you.<br>  <br>  Its probably all your fault.<br>  <br>  Your job is to cook and clean for him and bear and raise his children.<br>  <br>  His sexuality is all his own.....you get nothing.....<br>  <br>  According to THESE people here on Yahoo Answers, anyway!|`|3fbc09a4f95e4122e563714d654a599eaa	If it is effecting your relationship then I would say something.  As far as him listening he will for awhile but next time he goes on he will be even more sneakier about it.  As long as you have that computer in your home he will continue to be looking at the porn.  Not right but I can honestly state that it is guaranteed that he will not stop.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	At this point, it's bothering you enough to where you should just muster up some courage and ask him point blank, "What's so bad that you don't want me to know what you're looking at?" <br>  If you truly have a good relationship, that conversation should not be difficult to have.|`|Z9jlS2bUaa	Um honey, you better hope that it's only harmless porn. It could be really weird porn or somethng even worse than porn. What a great marriage you have that it's ok to erase history and no communication about it.|`|cDRXtuJCaa	well you need to confront this i just hope it adult porn he looking at, he could be cheating online or arange to meet ppl for sex etc seems a bit strange to be honest this would creep me out for,it not right to have secret life in marriage|`|FewhKlx9aa	I have a friend this happened to and now she's divorced and he's with someone else and no longer gets off on the computor.|`|NGKwsawdaa	Well if he's erasing it, that means he's hiding something from you.|`|tbJraueLaa	guilty as charged..|`|4o3jXz3Waa	Even if you wanted to just let it go, you wouldn't be able to.  This bothers you and it will continue to bother you until you talk to him about it.  Just be honest with him.  If the porn doesn't really bother you, then tell him, if he's trying to hide porn, then stop hiding it cause you really don't care.  Tell him you care MORE about the fact that he's trying to keep something from you than you do about him looking at porn.  Be calm and try to be non-confrontational when you talk to him to lessen the likelihood of a huge arguement.<br>  <br>  I really don't think you have any other option than to talk to him.
LAXbJfvwaa	There are a couple of options.  Dessy has some lovely dresses but I also find that David's Bridal and (to a certain extent) Alfred Angelo's are both a bit cookie cutter and boring.  You can definately do the traditional bridesmaid options which allow for two colours - but you could also check out standard formal or cocktail dresses - there is no reason that you can't get more than one of the same of these dresses.  Have a look at <a href="http://www.tjformal.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tjformal.com</a> - there are heaps of dresses and you can look at both options of the bridesmaids dresses or just standard 'social' dresses.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	davidsbridal.com<br>  edenbridals.com<br>  jordanfashions.com<br>  jasminebridal.com<br>  <br>  Those are the sites I have used the most.  While the main photo is often shown in just one color, the actual dresses are available in a wide range of colors (sometimes even fabrics, too).  Some of the sites will let you click on a different color and you can see how that color would look on the particular dress - - but be aware that different computers will show the colors differently so it is best to view a swatch in person at some point as well.|`|pfjxEZBmaa	Gah.

0jhzFOV8aa	Yes.  <br>  Sorry you didn't know your Dad growing up. You Dad may never have been a good father but if you had known him you wouldn't have any illusions about him.  <br>  You probably will always be attracted to older men, but at least try to use good judgement on finding a partner.

Everyone told me I was looking for a father figure which might have been true but honestly, I was just very mature for my age.  <br>  <br>  I think it could be a combination of both since an older man could provide you more security, safety and understanding, just as a father would and woman mature much faster than men do.<br>  <br>  In the long run, my relationship did not work out and he is still dating young girls so the best advice I can give you is date older men if it what you are attracted to but never rule out a guy within your age range because you never know what you could be passing up!  Great guys come in all ages, sizes and personalities so if you limit your choices too much you could possibly be passing up real potential love.|`|xQFtk1FXaa	maybe, im growing up w/o a mom and I always find that i enjoy talking to other moms...its not that im attracted to them but you know...i feel so left out being a girl without my mom there so they sort of substitute|`|8th9KY1haa	popdaddy gave a great answer.<br>  I also think than max.10 years.

edd42f73ff07afbfe3a2b220f65fe83faa	Honestly maybe she's just being really picky right now.  Maybe she's just keeping her options open and don't want to settle with you until she's sure you're the one.  That takes time you know.|`|AA11280073	Give her plenty of time.

From what you say happened, I would think it would bother anyone.

Maybe she likes you but is too overly afraid to try again.  She probably thinks is too fast or maybe she thinks you make a great friend or wants to analyze you a little further to make sure you can be a good faithful lover to her.|`|31afacd585ce32250ab966b7ff74d14aaa	Just be a friend and live your own life. If it is what she really wants, she will let you know. If she doesn't, she will let you know. Either way, by being a friend, you show her you care and can be a friend, and at the same time you don't lose sight of your own life.|`|421c8f8c199577a763ec8920182b7349aa	get over it..lol...im just kidding it is probably true though bcuz if u really like sumone and they brake up with u or sumthing its not like you'll get ovr it the nxt day so u should just date other girls and when she wants to then u can go out with her|`|5c0b130c3b5493d385442073fd78f42caa	I had a 3 yr relationship, my best friend hurt me, and then my mom got cancer...i work ft and do school ft...i pay for everything, and take care of my mom.

My best friend went out with a guy she's known since kindergarten but she had only really been friends with him for the past year. He broke up with her after a month over the phone. This happened 2 and a half months ago, and it still hurts her. Keep the flirting (or whatever guys call it) to a minimum, be there for her and you might end up being the knight in shining armor every girl dreams of.

I have a boyfriend whose favorite thing to do in his free time is play video games. The line to draw is free time. You shouldn't put video games before human beings. Yes, it is something you love to do and have a lot of fun doing and a girl will come along who understands that, but remember when you make plans with her that is your time together and when you have free time then you can play. Most girls wont like a guy who doesnt like to be out and social, but if you can do both than you will find someone who appreciates the effort you put into showing her she is important while not changing who you are. Don't settle, but dont become a zombie either. Best of luck.|`|a25c5589631fe8f7b20a009efcfdea0daa	lol there are girls out there, myself included.

A girl wants to feel special and not feel like an inanimate object comes first in your life instead of a human being. Ask yourself how much you play video games.

If someone isn't all that another person wants when they meet and get to know about eachother then a romantic relationship should not be pursued. It's best to date people who believe the same as you when it comes to religion.|`|8d2649a0a5df2930bae0fff3c675b2b0aa	That's perfectly okay.<br>  If relationships are of mixed moral values, things won't work out well and you'd disagree on so many things, maybe even something drastic, like cheating, etc.|`|AA10019604	I think it's ok.

He needs to accept her for who she is not what he wants her to be.  Sounds to me like he is looking for a reason to get rid of his girl.  If every person on earth is good enough for god, then why isnt she good enough for him?

It might be hard at first, but true friends are there for each other forever.  As his friend, you will be the one he turns to when times get hard.

I figure that when this wife leaves him too, I will be here to help him, again. (this is #3) <br>  <br>  Am I attracted to him? I think he's a hottie, but we have such a great connection, emotionally, and we are good friends, and he knows that I am always here for him.  I stepped back a little bit when he first got married but not so much anymore. Like I said, I don't agree with what he did but I am here to pick him up whenever he may fall.  He's my bud, and I can't let him fall without me trying to help him out.

e4d8acf62621155d3a622a3796056885aa	If it is was longer than 2 or 3 years you might want to take a look at it again. Since you have spent enough time with your ex, you know him very well. You shold try to look at why the relatinship did not last and ended up breaking. If you still keep thinking of the your ex and it has been longer than 8 - 9 months than it might be something ou need to take a look at. If you don't than it is not fair to yourself and your new guy. Besides, if you have spent so long with the ex and you cannot get him out of the head and you really love him... yes it is worth it.. just make sure he is on the same page as you and he wants and thinks of you just as much. Don't let anyone tell you not to do. You need to give another try! It is very hard to find TRUE Love and if you think it was him than you must look at it again. Atleast you'll know you tried it one last time.|`|4b72166a368fc2c1b1d35fc4a0f3b3b9aa	As you did say a long term relationship, don't you have enough time to figure out that you are getting nowhere?

23a477d2786b4263398e49277fe0d768aa	First of all, you aren't being ridiculous.  If your feelings are hurt, then there's no discounting that.  That's pretty bad that she wants someone else to walk down the aisle with your boyfriend.  If you don't think she's open hearted enough to become your friend again, then cut your losses and leave.  Act civil towards her but if she doesn't want your friendship anymore than you don't need that negativity.|`|80b8b140492c3473ea609c52fc59199aaa	you are young...get over it and move on.

Guys don't like a girl that is all over them, so keep doing what your doing and avoid being clingy.

I think that getting dolled up is a great idea! :)Good Luck|`|AA11589386	What you have to do is be yourself. That is what guys like about you. You do not have to ask him whether he like you or not.

You might be nice but bieng fat and/or ugly is a reflection on you and your self esteem and how you respect yourself. Girls who respect themselves and are normal care about how the world views them and how presentable they are when they walk out the door. There is no excuse for bieng fat in todays world and also no excuse for bieng ugly.<br>  <br>  Personally I steer clear of money grubbing girls, don't buy them drinks in a bar or lounge unless they came with me.<br>  <br>  Many guys also are nervous. You do need to flirt, otherwise a guy will think you are not interested and won't waste his time.<br>  <br>  You don't always have to flirt first, but sometimes it helps to show interest especially when you are already friends as the guy might feel you don't want more.|`|5cacd7c3cb34247904392e2c743bbde7aa	thats a tricky one, i cant understand why all my mates are in relationships and i am always the matchmaker to them.....when is someone gonna match make me???|`|96d14c9b70c4ef44a7c1f52676076b24aa	Thats a Great Question.

Most guys love it when a woman shows interest in what we do.  By no means should you read anything without his permission though if you care about him.  When he finds out, and he will find out, he will never be able to trust you again and eventually this will break you up.

You don't want him to get mad at you. If you read them while he's gone he might notice you read them and he will lose trust in you.

There are many student that are really mature for their age, and often teachers can relate to their students. However, there should be boundaries drawn between a student and a teacher.  It is very difficult in to have a close friendship because is easy to for someone else to get the wrong impression.  As far as dining out and watching movies together that is a no-no.  Unless this activity is done with a group of people, or the student and teacher is with in the same age group.  For example a senior in high school can do those activities (mentioned before), with a 22 year old student.  As long as the age group is the same (ex. 18-25).|`|AA10303112	You know its unethical....if you're a real teacher, that is.|`|AA11483301	uhh .. i cant say its unethical i would say the media blows it out of proprtion like those scandals wit students.. the teacher isnt supposed 2 but being friends is perfectly fine..|`|d1d44ff0b8944d8c3ceaa1842be6f896aa	I was very good friends with my sixth form college teacher when I was 16. We're both female so no question of sex, but I loved the subject and my teacher felt on the same wavelength as me. She ended up leaving college for unrelated reasons, but we met up once or twice in London and went shopping and to lunch together. I know it might sound weird to some people, but to me it felt totally normal. She liked me, I liked her and we weren't that much difference in age as she was about 25 at the time. We just got on and had loads in common. I think it might've been a bit strange if she's still been my teacher at the time we were socialising though. Generally speaking if a child is at school I don't think it is morally right for a teacher to become friends with a child, but if the student is 16 or older and it's at an adult institution it may be ok to socialise. Obviously sex is always wrong between a teacher and a student.|`|ebc0401a80a79edf85d0ca5d93512de8aa	it's ok but don't fall in love with her...|`|f6eeb830926f1963ac5958ed09d286aeaa	Hello Stevenson, Movies and especially Dining Out are things which a person would do with a date. Not a student. Be careful and be cautious of what people see which live in the same town! Rumors will begin to roll. Be careful of your career. Be extremely careful in general. It is ok to be friends but that is really crossing the line,,,,,, Dining out. Please Stevenson be careful.

Well, do you like him? Because its easily likely that if you like him, you could easily ask him out and it'll be a snap. Because he's simply flirting with you, if you dont like him, wait till he asks you out, and reject, it'll make you feel guilty for a while, but its alright, its not your fault for not liking him, and he'll get over you.|`|049293d1294daaed7314681cee59302aaa	For sure!

Even my coworkers told me that he never used to bother coming over to say hi or talk until I got there.  It was his way of getting me to notice him.

Also learn to prompt the conversations not necessarily asking direct questions but u can say ' i did so and so or had so and so in my school did you?' find out about what usually goes on around where he is that can be a basis for lots of discussion. so prompt him but also tell him how you feel|`|6d971e58749bd86fc0ce5b0b06ddf053aa	you should ask him how was it .. or whatever .. you need to break the ice and start having long conversations with him .. and he should do the talking but you need to start it|`|AA11097048	Fist off: you say to him, "BF, I think you are taking me for granted."  You then continue by telling him what your desires and expectations are.  If he doesn't want to have that conversation...then you may want to consider the idea that he is indeed taking you for granted and there are specific reasons he is not sharing things with you.  You have every right to expect him to share his life 'goings-on' with you...if he doesn't want to play fair..then you should consider letting him go.|`|AA11994789	Wait for the right moment to tell him that.  When you're in a romantic mood, for instance.  Tell him softly that you are very interested in his life.

AA11097048	Well, depends of the guy.  If he is a psychopath and a cannibal it may mean  he is hungry and is deciding between fillet and chops....but usually it simply means he has found something he likes...<br>  Unless it is something freakishly huge, then he is just looking at it thinking "oh-my-damn."<br>  <br>  Mostly guys check out what they fancy.|`|a949fe9d91dcf6e4540f1410108d42f5aa	No not necessarily, it's probably just hormones raging out of control

Now speaking from experience, i have been in the same position as you, It does not sound like he actually knows what he wants. The best thing is to tell him exactly how you feel, give him time to think things through, And take it from there! Take baby steps. Sometimes things are not meant to be, sometimes they are, But only fate can decide that!

ab5155a2185dd95788467cb93e36256caa	The face is the first thing that a human being learns to recognize and we have a special part of our brains that is dedicated solely to facial recognition. I would say because of this that facial features are the most important.

As mentioned, we are keyed to facial recognition from birth and humans instinctively know when a face is 'wrong'. I agree with the comment that 'Body' follows closely after 'Face'.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the 'adult' part of me realises that 'physical' - while often the first point of attraction - is not the only way that people can be attractive.

Be equally outraged about things that outrage him.<br>  Reach over and touch his arm when you're about to speak to him or otherwise get his attention.<br>  Use impeccable manners.

DO NOT ask him to call you or when you might see him again.<br>  DO tell him how much you have enjoyed talking with him, how wonderful it is to see him again.<br>  DO be aware of how receptive he is to your flirtation. If he's not responding, go flirt with someone else. He might just change his mind; if not, you didn't need to be wasting your precious time on him.<br>  Most importantly, Laugh and Smile and enjoy yourself.

d768942d7979ad2f5bdf31564d97b27baa	I think at this point after you have talked to this person about these issues, it's time to get a little bit more bold. now, it's all about respect and that goes both ways. I had a room mate in my younger years and my room mate was 15 years older than me and had 200 lbs on me as well and had the worst foot Oder I've ever experienced, Not having foot Oder myself (don't know why and even wore boots every day) I thought it was extremely rude that he would take off his boots and stink up the house when I had a female friend over and after I was embarrassed for the last time, I took his boots one night and tossed those 600.00 Tony Lama's in the pool. After he came at me and I put him on his asss, I just stood over him and said, now...lets make a plan over your stinking asss feet and bhla bhla bhla.. the bottom line was after you talked  to your roommates and getting out isn't an option, maybe showing them your real serious about the destruction of your property.You should go back to worring about hurting their feelings after they start worring about your stuff.

But the one always moving things around is really tipping the scale. He is aiming for a confrontation with u so, trying not to hurt his feelings doesn't even come into the picture. He already has some beef for u esp since he is always replacing urs with his & u spoke to him already.<br>  <br>  Go ahead. Move out. U'v already 'tried'. No one will blame you. Life is dificult enuff on the outside without u having to face harshness in ur own personal space at home when u supposed to be relaxing.<br>  <br>  Before u leave though, u could try having a word or 2 with the one with d odor for his own sake. its the good Samaritan thing to do.|`|AA11194855	oh this is like, the worst.  i havent personally been in this situation, but i've seen it happen. wut my friend did to tell the other person that they had SUCH bad B.O. & like, they never showered or anything,  & there was a grey line of frickin gross dirt around the girl's neck...well my friend was like, "im sorry, but you have really bad body odor and it is VERY offensive, please, just take care of yourself more often and shower daily."  & the girl DID get really upset, but my gosh. she ended up showering more often (thank goodness).

b0e380b7334a61860f262440508138cfaa	Hi, <br>  This is very good that you are worried about her satisfaction .<br>  In sex there are two things <br>  1. Fore play<br>  2. Intercourse.<br>   <br>  Woman can enjoy fore play maximum if you/she knows her G-Spots.By stimulating the G-spots she gets the maximum enjoyment. Which helps her to get Orgasm in intercourse.<br>  During the  intercourse  generally man care for his orgasm (Ejaculation) which give negative feeling to woman.

AA11280073	Wow, it sound like you have become the victim of bullies. Even though you are a tomboy, the time has come to change your style a bit to fit in. A little bit of make-up and some clothes with style won't kill you. You may even like it. Try having a party and invite some of the girls. See if you can make at least one friend. If it gets any worse, you will have to talk to a couselor at school. Someone could get hurt.|`|df9680445dd583418b9a787aedbd8b96aa	Because they are weak and shallow!!!! be yourself and be confident...as far as I am concerned..if they can dish it out...they should be able to take it!!!!<br>  Sounds like a bad casting of "mean girls"...you don't worry they will get theirs...they always do.

It's understandable that you would be angry and/or jealous of someone who is getting the attention (among other things) of the girl you love. I know from personal experience that I can't help the way I feel about someone when it comes to romance. Sometimes the feelings stay strong, sometimes they simmer down and stay that way, and sometimes the feelings go away completely. I've even had an experience where the feelings went away and then came back. I've found that if I step out of the situation, look at everything that has happened, and think things over that I can handle the situation better. Take your time.

I'm a Christian, I believe in God! And for that reason I believe that there is love at first sight. God sometimes maybe lets people (like me) see right away who He intended them to love and marry. Love is different with everyone because we are all different! You can't describe true love for anyone! Everyone's experience of loving or being in love is totally unique. Because we area all unique!<br>  I am so tired of the people that say smugly, "i believe in lust at first sight" because they don't know. I don't have problems with lust, and I have experienced that feeling of "wow, look, there he is, the guy I was created for". I just looked at his eyes from the side and I got that feeling. I wasn't looking at his body at all.<br>  Please believe me- that even if it hasn't happened to you, or never will, it is POSSIBLE<br>  Please do not listen to these other people. Although they mean well, I know personally that there can be real, true, lasting love (not LUST or INFATUATION! Boy am I sick of those dumb words! People just use them to sound grownup and wierd and fancy shmancy! {not to "dis" you other folks, but that's what it seems like to me :)} at first meeting- and yes, even at first sight. As to what it feels like... everyone is totally different. If you think you are in love, and you love someone very much, more than any one else, than you ARE in love- for the time being. You may, who knows, some day, find someone else who you will be able to love even more. Not because you didn't love the first one- you did, as much as you could at the time. But each new person you fall in love with you seem to be able to love more. Who can say whether we are all in love a dozen times in our life, or if we only "really" love one of those people, or if we never "truly" loved any of them? Love is different for every person, at every different time. Sometimes it makes you sad, sometime it makes you happy, sometime insecure, sometimes confident. No one knows. But if you think you're in love, then tell yourself you are and go with your emotions, whether you become mournfully melancholy or exuberantly happy. There is nothing sweeter than feeling something deeply and telling yourself you're in love, whether it's for an hour or a lifetime- or eternity. <br>  I fell in love from first sight with someone I only met once a year ago. I still am. For many reasons in a long story, we can't contact each other, nor do we "date" so there isn't a questions of all that "faithfulness" junk. But I knew at the first second that I was made for him and someday God will see we marry and live happily ever after. Sometime I will type up the whole story and post it on every "love at first sight" page and question and blog in the whole wide internet. Again, I am not saying that love at first sight is the only right kind of love. Maybe you will hate the person you eventually fall in love with! Maybe it will take you years to gradually love them! Who knows? I am not saying that it is the only true kind of love. With some people, it may take a while to fall in love with thier soulmate. But love at first sight is so very possible! Sometimes the good Lord is kind enough to show you right away. Like he showed me. The moment I saw him standing there, I knew all about him. His character- how kind and sweet he was, how helpful and patient. And don't say I was judging a book by its cover. Later in the day I met up with him again and talked to him for five hours at that wedding reception. And my first impression- that split second thought of "this is who I was created for and am meant to marry" was strengthened. And he is in my every thought and dream. I don't give a passing thought or glance to anyone else- it's just out of the question. I’ve only seen him only 3 times over the years. It’s been so long. But I still love him! I do! It’s real! I fell in love when I was only 13. But that’s how old Juliet was, and it was love at first sight and no one questions her! No one says “Oh, Juliet was so dumb, she didn’t REALLY love romeo, she just killed herself because she THOUGHT she did”. Why should you say that about me? <br>  <br>  There is love at first sight. <br>  <br>  Not lust.<br>  <br>  Not infatuation.<br>  <br>  Not a crush.<br>  <br>  Not a passing attraction. <br>  <br>  Real, true, lasting, beautiful, perfect love.<br>  <br>  Believe.

He'll eventually get your messages though and I think I'd wait and hear from him before attempting further contact.  The possibilities are endless....so there's nothing to gain by pondering the matter any further.  If there's a crisis that he needs your help with I'm sure you'll find out soon enough.  After 18 months you probably know him pretty well by now.  You'll just have to wait it out.  Good Luck|`|AA10935760	may be he is stuck in some problem,go n visit him its better to clear everyhting......................|`|459d22283bf4f0ad8bc8d8ea4a071bc2aa	The love of your life, and you are not in a committed relationship? Obviously, if this has been going on for 18 months, he does not feel the same way. <br>  <br>  I would look to moving along. He is not in it for the long haul, and you have built this up in your own imagination.|`|4bf4ab15b020af5bf89f30e932af331faa	maybe he left town or maybe the worst has happened. if you guys are not in a committed relationship (technically) he does not have to call you back until he wants to, he don't answer to you and you have to live with that fact.|`|6e4c1ca56d93ab6c823e2d1b49adee5eaa	Stop worrying..you all agreed on a open relationship, which means, he can date other woman, which means he has probably met someone else.  You are probably calling him too much and you are appearing to be a bit needy.  Stop calling him so much.  Go on some dates..when you start ignoring him, he'll come around.|`|0b635848858188e9ee8e14a3e3f8e5deaa	First of all, stop calling him and texting him. That just makes you look desperate. Why have you been with a guy in a non-committed relationship for 18 months? You say that he is good to you, but he will not commit? That sounds very odd to me. <br>  <br>  Here is the deal, you are not committed to one another, therefore he can do what ever he wants. Maybe he has found another girl, which is ok because he is not your boyfriend, so he can do what ever he wants. <br>  <br>  Are you having sex with him? Maybe he doesn't see you as girlfriend material because you didn't respect yourself enough to at least be official with him before being intimate with him. He could very well be ready for a more mature relationship and has found someone else. If so, this is a great opportunity for you to move on and find a different guy that is willing to be more then just "friends." You have seen what doesn't work, so do things different this next time. Wait on sex. And if he isn't your boyfriend, he is just a friend...nothing more. <br>  <br>  This is assuming that you are an adult woman. If you are still in school, move on, you'll find more guys in the future. Friends are more important then Guys right now anyways. Do not lower yourself to be some guy's "Friend W/ Benefits."|`|38ae57d1702f936b6e8785182599e38aaa	He isn't in a committed relationship with you, so you can't really complain about it or hold it against him.  Give him the benifit of the doubt.  He may be out of town, tied up at work or something of that nature.  If he thought you were worried about it, he would had called you back.   I know I don't call some of my friends back right away and sometimes I forget they called or forget to call them back.  No biggy when I do finally call them or they call back.   Hardly an issue to argue or get mad over.|`|aac9e99cfbd47367e4f29a390df5846caa	Try your hardest to back off. Maybe he just needs his space. If you over do it with the phone calls and the text it will scare him. Guys are wierd like that. Try to give your self a time line on not calling or texting. Try may be 3 days. Sit back and whait.  If he dont call back then he is not worth it. He may have a new girl friend. It might be hard for him to talk to you if he still has feeling for you.|`|ba3e4ca7e48eacb4c99ab14babf5b5ffaa	well since you guys are not in a committed relationship it just sounds like you guys are friends and he doesnt have to account to you on what he does and really doesnt have to pick up your calls if he doesnt want to becuase your not in a relationship with him. theres nothing wrong with you or him its just you guys are not together so that give him the right to do what he wants. find someone who will want to be in a relationship with you and give you the attention you need.|`|e0b6ba10e705e56c24ad2ff5e062aedeaa	Any skeletons in the closet? One of them may have found him...|`|fb9514f3e9e5d047f66394b7739c40a1aa	Maybe some thing is wrong maybe you should pay him a vist with some candy and see if he is ok if he's sick stay by his side don't leave or he may think you really don't care

If he is playiing games, just act like you are secure and the real feeling will follow.  Besides, don't you think you are worth it?  Just because they are not prettier than you are does not mean he would not cheat on you.  The fact that you are committed should stop him from cheating, remember that.  Even if those other girls were hot, he is with you.  And for good reason!|`|13e9f4c8147935978151541b56c6de5faa	if he cheatin on u w/ ugly bitches then leave him. if they hotter than u he's doin what ne sain guy would gettin hot pussy|`|34aab1935da0d5ebe11227d7c214b0efaa	He is trying to front in front of his boys.

She uses an additional 2000-3000 vocal sounds to communicate, as well as 8000-10000 gestures, facial expressions, head movements, and other body language signals. This means she has an average of 20000 communication 'words' daily to relate her messages.<br>  <br>  Compared to women's daily 'chatter', men use 2000 to 4000 words, 1000-2000 vocal sounds, and 2000-3000 body language signals. This adds up to a THIRD of a what women use - about 7000 'words' a day.<br>  <br>  For men, the phone is a tool for communication and like any tool is used when the situation demands it.

He can either be your boyfriend or he can say he doesn't want too...  Be your own Leading Lady in your life!  Do Not Ever ask a guy what you mean to him (lable or whatever) you should know that by his actions!|`|AA11987197	No, you're just not hinting very well. Stop hinting! Hinting is a relationship killer! I've known more relationships killed by hinting than by infideleity!<br>  <br>  Tell him "I'm ready to be your girlfriend." And use words! Let the words come from your mouth where he can hear you! Then he won't be confused, becuase you'll actually be telling him what you want! Then if he's ready to be your boyfriend, he'll say something along the lines of, "Good, I'm ready to be your boyfriend," or he might ask, "What happened to 'no labels'" to which you can answer, "I'm over that, I'm ready for a label now. I want to be your girlfriend." Since this is a 360 turn from where you started, he's going to want to be sure. He doesn't want to fall for a trap, and if you've just been "hinting" that you're ready to be a girlfriend, that smells like a trap! It sounds like, "Oh, here, ask me to be your girlfriend so I can slap you around emotionally by reminding you I don't do labels."<br>  <br>  Take this as example to understand why  he's confused: I'm in computer repairs. What if you asked me to repair your computer, and I said, "Yeah, I can do that, but I don't believe in money, so you'll have to barter something for it." We bartered that you would give me some food instead. Then when we were done, I handed you a bill for $300. What would you say? You've done basically the same thing to him.|`|2e0d7279ae4d49dee7510e36a0a4d4aeaa	Boot the John out. You need to take a good look at yourself. Sleeping with a guy that is confused?

Ci siamo follemente innamorati in quelle due settimane, dopodiche' mi sono dovuta trasferire negli stati uniti dove ho studiato, e sto ancora studiando, per il quarto anno.<br>  Abbiamo, e stiamo ancora facendo, la storia a distanza, e non ho MAI avuto il pensiero di tradirlo. E lui neanche. Vallo a spiegare a tutti quelli che mi credevano ingenua, e che mi dicevano "avoglia le corna che ti sta mettendo" e altri che lo dicevano a lui. Il pensiero passeggero quando sei sola, quando lui gia dorme e tu sei sola nel letto vogliosa di baci, ci puo' essere anche stato, ma tornavo sempre a volere lui. <br>  La storia a distanza e' una m.erda ma tra pochi mesi finira', finalmente. Sapessi quanto m'imbestalivo quando sentivo amiche che avevano tradito i loro ragazzi che erano li', a due passi, con i quali potevano passare sotto casa per dargli un bacio, o anche soltanto dividere la sigaretta insieme, cose cosi' piccole che io avrei dato, e ancora darei, l'anima per poter fare con tale nonchalance. Mi arrabbiavo col mondo intero, col karma ed il fato e l'universo e loro, specialmente, ma poi sentivo la sua voce e mi sentivo sempre piu' unita a lui e capivo che avevamo qualcosa di veramente speciale.<br>  Dunque non tutti tradiscono, ma coloro che tradiscono non sono veramente innamorati, la verita' e' quella. Perche' in passato ho tradito percio' ti posso parlare per esperienza. <br>  Non t'offendere, non tutti capiscono l'amore. E non prendertela solo con le donne, perche' pure i maschi non scherzano mica!

Well I think you should approach him by saying "hi" or something. This is worth a try. If he is a loser, then he won't answer. that is a good indicator of jerkishness lol. So what if it is random to approach him? Anyways, if he is good at something, like playing the drums, and you see him carrying drumsticks or something, that is a good excuse to talk to him. I know it is scary, and most people would not have the guts. But I hope you do, and I hope everything goes okay. Tell us what happens, okay?<br>  Good luck!|`|YzQGB4ouaa	Make eye contact and wait.  If he doesn't approach you after a few glances, get "accidentally" in his way.  If he ignores you totally he's not interested.  If he touches your waist to prevent him from bumping into you, you are one step closer.<br>  <br>  The next step is talking (or dancing if in a super loud club).  Get him interested, ask him questions that he can not just say "Yes" or "No" to.<br>  <br>  If you want to take a chance, you can always try to find him on the cell-flirt service( <a href="http://x.azjmp.com/0KLjv" rel="nofollow">http://x.azjmp.com/0KLjv</a> )  It's pretty fun to get a text message from across the room from a hottie.

Oh, I'm sure you think it's no big deal; he's just a man, right? You think you're allowed to smack him a few times if he gets out of line.<br>  <br>  Do him a huge favor and break up with him. If you hit him again, I hope he calls the cops.|`|8adee73ccc06e52ea84f99eba7588af8aa	You were violent with him?

You should give him your excuses.<br>  However, it is obvious that we can't compare hitting a physically weaker and smaller person (for example, a child or a small woman) to a man. Phtsical harm depends on the body structure. If we would give a tap in the shoulder to a baby, that would be physical abuse, if we do it with a colleague, it is just a sign of friendship. Also, it is not just a question of size but of sensitiveness. A mature person should know when they have gone too far. <br>  The same applies to every comparison between any other two mature human beings irrespective of their sex.|`|AA10591117	He has you trapped.  If you don't get physical/verbal w/ him, he'll keep escalating his aggrevating behavior until you do.
ca106532e616edadb064105bc89011e7aa	Sounds as if she is young and immature and playing games. She means well though, she is just going about it all the wrong ways. Appears as if she likes you but at first did not want to come off as too willing, so she tells you "we should take it slow". Then she did not like it when you followed her advice to take it slow, so now she says she is not sure about having a relationship with you "because you are not rushing into one with her". Now she is trying to be manipulative by trying to make you think someone else is interested in her. My advice to you would be to really look before you leap. She sounds very wishy washy, this can lead you into a lot of confusion and frustration. Hope I helped.|`|4779eb7eebe6ca2d910d56a9b6745e39aa	Forget her, move on and have fun, no point in waiting around...|`|7a75gAXiaa	I think you should go after her i mean if you like her i would go after her and tell her how much you love her and be honest and don;t lie|`|AA11985584	She is being imature and does not know what she wants.  Look for love elsewhere and good luck!|`|Zso1AnxQaa	Sounds like to me she is confused and doesn't know what she wants.<br>  Just be friends with her for a while and let her get her head straight. Wait a couple of months or so, then talk to her about relationships again.<br>  If you are there for her through he good and bad relationships, she'll view you as a good friend and you'll become even closer to each other.<br>  Good luck !

If you mean sleeps with them, well, it depends on the situation and the people involved.  I intend to save myself for marriage, and I know many people who are doing the same.  The kinds of guys who are after a piece so soon may be as you describe, but I certainly would not expect anyone else to be.  You shouldn't believe everything you hear.  Some people have absolutely no sense and no taste when it comes to the opposite sex.  Good luck!|`|AA11707323	Yes that is very true.  That's why the advice to women is always make him work for you and continue to make him work for you even after your married.  Men dont like anything that comes easy and they will take you for granted the second they can.  You always need to have the upper hand and you always need to be one step ahead of them.

Just keep trying the casual, hopefully he will get it soon|`|Cxq6kifdaa	just make eye contact with him, and let him know that your trying to get his attention, evenually he will come to you.|`|YLbMAY4oaa	you sound like you really like him but if he hasnt made a move than you should just go on to the next guy dont waste all your time on one guy if he wants you than hell say it|`|azKxvLkwaa	dont try to get him if he likes u he will come to u at the right time girls dont run down boys run us down|`|nJE8bQ5saa	Well it sounds like your in High School or So.... I think you walk up to him and say hi, and from then try to build up a conversation, but if your not the type to walk up to someone then try to stand out, or take friends with you to talk to him, then when you feel comfortable to talk to him by yourself, the next time go alone.... I hope everything works out for u!!

lXkYILvcaa	dont worry man i used to be afraid of dancing myself in high school. And i got all afraid that i would screw up or something. But as long as you got a girl, and both of you appreciate each other. You'll have a really fun night. Slow dancing is easy because all you do is put your hands around her hips / side and she puts her hands over your neck and you move a little bit. Grinding is difficult to become good at, but slow dancing is funner.|`|8006c7ebb9ff62a1f5a8e971007ca320aa	put your hands on her hips thats usually what ppl do. then she will put her arms round ur neck and might put her head on ur chest. thats bout it. lol.|`|YOHp2PWkaa	watch the other peolpe at first|`|wrnagaSlaa	You hold her hips and she holds your shoulders in the basic slow dancing, you just move in a small circle rotating it. Look into her eyes. I would try practicing if your unsure, I wish you good luck!|`|MobWncEFaa	ummmm.....just go to a dance instructor and try.<br>  No money?<br>  Ask your mom..|`|AA11502176	slow dancing is easy, i prefer it. Depending how close you are, you just hug each other and sway back and forth, and make out. forget that last part. <br>  <br>  hold her hand in your left hand, right hand on waist, move together, doesn't matter where or how, just try to do it rhythmically and in time with music, comes completely naturally though. <br>  <br>  Faster dancing, generally have a little more space, move your feet and do something with your arms, it really doesn't matter. You'll have the best time if you don't care and just react to the person your with. Fool around, walk like an egyptian, make funny movements and get sexy sometimes. <br>  <br>  easy as pie, just need to believe in yourself.|`|86a96d3da3b8c998b43c7d6cf6ac39c8aa	why don't the both of you practice before the dance!

3e62268f401c0665ff9312997df67486aa	they might be really mean to you if they are that type of person. they might do this to make sure you think they don't like you, even if they do.<br>  they might show off for you. By showing off i mean they might raise their hand in class more often and be more aggressive in sports, things like that. <br>  they might be in that activities that you are in<br>  they might suddenly like the same things you do<br>  and thats all i have|`|EX3WarGoaa	they will stare at you constantly. they will talk to you and hang around you more often. they will email and IM you a lot. they will also "Somehow" be in almost every activity you are participating in. they will also listen to you often, tell you secrets, and other stuff they dont tell their freinds.
rZF8oiaRaa	I know that right now it seems unfair to you, but realize your mom loves you so much and just wants you to be safe.  Ask your mom if you could have your friends over to watch movies, or have her drive you and your friends to the mall, she may be willing to sit in the food court or do her own shopping, while you and your friends hang out.|`|253b096af15c8d279b63971e8bb647a0aa	Quit crying.  In my book, you are spoiled.  Every day my mother tells me about how stupid and ugly I am, and how I ruined her life and that she wishes I would die. I would take your mom ANY day.|`|41636f8fb5d54a6a840da147610f2b39aa	My mom was like this when I was your age. Pretty soon she will start letting you have more priveleges. but the first thing to do ( and it helps speed up the process) is to show her that you are mature enought to do things on your own.|`|AA12225497	I don't understand the last part real well. You sound alot like my sister's friend. She is 16 though and she basically can't go anywhere. Her parents are really over protective and stuff. They won't let her hang out with my sister, go to the movies or even talk to boys online or the phone! My sister is upset cause she can't even hang out with her friend. Your parents are just concerned about your safety, remember that. They are not doing that because they are angry with you or just being strict. They just want you to grow well behaved and safe. Lets face it we live a dangerous cynical world, where everyone has to fight for their life. Just tell your mom how you feel about how she is treating you. Say mom can you please just give me some type of freedom...ask her nicely. Try doing extra chores for her and treating her really speacially. Maybe if she sees you being very responsible she will think about giving you more time out of the house around other people...like I said this situation sounds so much like my sister's friend. Anyways I hope you find some way of gaining more freedom, hon......in the mean time though lots of luck :)|`|Zso1AnxQaa	You need to stand up for herself amd tell her "Hey, I am practically adult, and if you love me and respect me, you need to treat me like the gae I am.".|`|fb8a814c78b9ea803ce553353913cea0aa	Ask your mom if SHE will take you and a friend to the movies.  Or ask your mom if an aunt or other family member can take you and a couple of friends.    And if I were you, I'd make sure my friends knew it's not OK to talk crazy stuff about boys around your mom.  <br>  <br>  At least this will be a starting point with your mom.  You are still fairly young, so it isn't unusual how your she is acting.  Give it time, and try to convince her to let you do more chaperoned group activities.|`|ac42f7eebcea4b7123e259818cc05dacaa	What is she overprotecting you from?<br>  <br>  What are your friends like?

Get out of that "used," "cheated on" and "sucker" role, faster then you got into it. <br>  <br>  When you are young, your only responsability is to yourself, to get through school and to respect your parents. <br>  <br>  Walk away. Look at these postings, people who are 10 and 20 years older than you have so much pain in their souls about this kind of garbage. <br>  <br>  --- except they have children, jobs and a house-payments. This pattern is present in people's lives, and it can become a way of thinking. People can and do change, but spare yourself the pain and heartache. <br>  <br>  Don't start on that train. Start over, find new friends while you are young and still can.|`|1zbBBgUNaa	Sounds like the jerk is getting what he deserved!! Dont' worry about it anymore! Sure, he got to make out with your girl and now hates her, well guess what? SHE HATES HIM, TOO! She sees that you were there, now probably feels stupid enough.

AA11903338	Sometyms, but not always. Girls don't always mean exactly wat they mean. <br>  <br>  To me... I sounds like she might be interested in you, she thinks your cute, but she might or might not like you. <br>  <br>  If you just met her like a week ago for instance there is no way of knowing wheter she is "starting to have feelings for you" b/c she just started to get to know you.|`|2db560d9bbdc08c0bdad382b41a19758aa	shes stradling the border go for the kill while things are still hot|`|9f185e172e3699bc83f0c75d0db75b6eaa	she likes u<br>  make ur move<br>  but dont rush<br>  make it slow n steady<br>  <br>  good luck!
n46ygzlXaa	yes its true... hardly will a girl admit it on ur face but its still there.. but she needs to know for sure that the guy is after her not only for her "hot" status but much more... and u tell me how many guys u know are interested in more than just a bit of fun???
9f370bc437d12a2a92dbf03140c3972eaa	Try to talk to the girl & interrogate the reason for such behavior of hers. If she's in love with the guy, why did she go for America?<br>  <br>  If she's got valid reasons, try to persuade her to change the decision or decide about your future plan of action.<br>  <br>  But if the reasons are not valid, or if she's taken such decision keeping practical aspects in mind or due to confusion, I'd advice that guy to neutralize his feelings about the relationship and move on. <br>  <br>  It's easier said than done, but that's the way of life. It goes on.

AA11109801	I understand what your saying - best suggestion is tell dad that you would appreciate if he wouldn't dump on you about mom.  Remind him that you love him but he needs to let it go and move on especially since he has remarried also.|`|AA11537569	Some pain run deep but your dad should be over it now especially since he has remarried and made a life for his self.  But the problem is that he's never forgiven your mother for whatever it was he thinks she did.  When he truly forgives, then he will be able to move on and stop his complaining.  But unfortunately for you, you are the one that suffers.  You can make the statement to him that you are not your mother and you can't change what happen and that you would like to talk about something else other that.  Good luck.|`|35abfa1c2bf42a5171aa45212d0dc851aa	he needs counseling, but at his age i doubt he will go.  too bad, so much wasted energy.  you cant do much of anything if he wants to be miserable thats his decision.  just ignore it or offer some advice to see a therapist.|`|AA11146414	If its been 21 years since they divorced he obviously isnt ready or able to let go of the past in regards to the hurt she/he caused and just may need therapy. I suggest you tell him to get off your A** if he has something to say to her then he needs to stay it to her and not to you because you had nothing to do with their choices, actions or divorce. I have a 13yr old daughter from a previous marriage we divorced when she was about 18 months old he has chosen not to be apart of her life but if at any point IF he wanted contact with her I would not prevent it. I do not talk bad about him to her or in front of her neither does anyone in my family or any of our friends that know the true reason we divorced. I am also the step mother of a 6yr old daughter and I will not allow people to bad mouth my "other" daughters biological mother either. As many faults as she has the child doesnt need to be made aware of our opinions and should be allowed to form her own.|`|AA11798022	Listen You are not his sounding post.  He needs to keep you out of the middle reguardless of your age.  He should realize that you may want a relationship with her.  Tell him in a easy tone that you no longer want to hear him complaining and that the next time he calls or you call and he starts to complain that you will end the conversation and hang up.  He needs to stop and realize that maybe it was for the best for all parties involved. <br>  <br>  Sorry to hear that he is pulling you in!

However, if they stop soon, it might have been just a phase. You can talk to them about it wether they stop or not, and that is a more direct way to find out. I hope this all gets worked out! Bye!|`|e43af09176dd9cc830cb140f3b2928fcaa	f*ck'em they aint friends.|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	just wait<br>  if they are true friends<br>  everything will work out|`|e223c2bcf2658ef052b9f50017d7fba7aa	Those aren't friends. Tell them how you feel & leave it at that. They don't need any more explanation for treating you that way. I hope everything works out okay.
lk7OXsA7aa	Its a very tricky situation u seem to be in, but honestly i am a guy myself so i will give u the low down from a guys point of view. Best thing to do is to give him space, trust me, there is nothing more annoying then an ex asking u questions on why things are not the way he said they wud be. Back off and wait for him to come, trust me, sooner or later he will start talking to you. I am pretty sure he didnt use u, he felt he liked u, and after u two made love, well  guess he maybe just shyed away. Most girls think having sex with their boyfriend brings them closer together, truth is, 90% of the time it pushes the boy away. So just relax, and things will be fine, dont try and make things work as you will only end up making things worse.<br>  Hope that made sense.|`|536e3d62cde69387e086bc477cc68811aa	I would just ignore him!  You said you know where you are not wanted.  Obviously he doesn't want to be your friend right now.  So just relax and maybe in the near future you 2 may be friends again.|`|AA10280287	Did something embarrassing happen during your get together?  Perhaps he is avoiding eye contact and conversation with you because he is embarrassed.  Don't torture yourself, he m;ay come around once he gets passed the embarrassment (if that is what it is), if he doesnt come around, tell him how you feeel honestly and then try to move on.  You dont want to torture yourself.|`|aa741e73d7608d2af0f4792ae65de029aa	<sigh> Just one more example of what happens when teenagershave sex before they are ready. He had sex with you even though he know he wasn't going to be with you forever. And you had sex with him and you really need to admit to yourself that you also did not think this relationship was the one and only you will ever have in your life. So did you use him? You both used eachother, him for sex, you for the attention he gave you and now it is over. What is the point of drudging it up and making accusations? You made a mistake-you used and were used. Move on and don't have silly ideas of going back to being friends now that you have been intimate with eachother and have made some pretty strong accusations. He obviously doesn't want anything to do with you anymore and now you are pusing the issue. Drop it and move on and next time don't be so quick to open your heart and your body up to a guy who isn't ready to respect you, when you obviously don't have a whole lot of respect for yourself.|`|3a705bf0321bf4809136d6a880ae5862aa	It doesn't sound like he's interested in being your friend.  He did use you.  It's better to break up as soon as you realize it's not working, no matter what the day, or holiday.  I broke up with my ex the night before Christmas Eve (but granted, a week before that he was willing to "re-evaluate the relationship." Whatev), and yea my timing was bad, but there was no sense whatsoever in postponing it until the day after Christmas.  He did use you hun, and he has no right to be mad at you for saying so.  Props to you for standing your ground.  Now he's trying to make your mutual friends choose between you and him.  If your friends are going to choose sides, then they weren't your friends.  You don't want to be friends with a guy like this.  He's jerking you around, which it sounds like is what he does best.  Move on, and enjoy your drama-free life without him.  That's the best revenge.|`|GL6u7xJBaa	Sounds like shame. It's really difficult for a guy to say no to sex, but he should have had your feelings in mind. Society places way too much importance on virginity and the first time, and it only causes pain and misery for us. Don't let it get to you. It's possible that he didn't realize what it meant to you, but you guys should have talked about it. Too late now. Let him pout. Don't chase him. I hope your friends know what happened. There's no way they'd dump you.

Most people will tell you that you have to just be yourself.  As for bumping up your guy stuff, well, that's what you'll have to do.  Join a sport or other club where you are around people.  That is always a good thing to do whether you are a teenager or an adult. Be sure to practice making eye contact.  Practice in the mirror and then tell yourself you will make contact with someone for 10 seconds (that's along time for a shy guy) and then 15, and then 20, etc.  Confidence is killer for the ladies...

And, truly there's no harm in getting to know someone better- Time will tell if there's any substance to your relationship (should one develop).|`|1ae7486c6f3527855ce2c2499f850ac2aa	Yes in general people date and end up happy with people that they are most similar with.  For example, about the same income level, some of the same interests, educations, etc.  There is less conflict in the matter and lovers don't feel suporoir to the other.   But there's no hram in meeting someone new.

Either way it comes back will help you decide your next step, which is going on a date with this guy, or moving on to other prospective boyfriends.|`|wrnagaSlaa	Okay, first things first, you said you like him! I'm shy too, so I get up the nerves to write him a note asking him if he likes me(signed by a different person) or ask my friends to casually have a talk with him. Or if you just want to be blunt, ask him in a note or in person to date. Good luck and hope it works!

If he did, then move on.  You said that you kinda moved on.  Well, that means you have gotten over him better than expected.  Sometimes, someone new often works out better since every relationship is a stepping stone to a better and happier level.  <br>  <br>  But it all depends on what happened in your past relationship.  Without details, we cannot truly give you a good recommendation.  I often view ex's coming back due to them realizing how special you were and how they blew their chances.  If they had something good, then let them work to earn you back.  If they left you the first time, what will make them leave you again....could it happen again??  You need to make sure of this so that you will not set yourself up for another heartache and disappointment.  You can go back and takes your chances in a crap shoot or start something new with a new slate.<br>  <br>  Good luck  =)

7d3c78e568920b3f9a8c5a5f840213d4aa	You can conquer your fear by facing it. So what if you get nervous or scared, everbody does. For all you know he wants to tell you he likes you too.  Or you can wait until you're in your 60-70's and wonder what might have been. Humility last a short while, happiness can last a lifetime. Imagine if every guy who got turned down by a girl never asked anyone else out...it would be the end of mankind. If you're embarassed, who cares, take some crap from your friends for a month or two if he slams you, or be the envy of your friends for finding Mr. Perfect. If you constantly shy away you are destined for lonliness, eventually you will realize what is right for you.|`|501e1e8d33c2c3cc4ad0c161dbc7f109aa	I understand how you feel.  It is very scary especially at your age.. hey it is still scary at my age (40+).  I would just make an excuse to approach him with small talk.  It does not have to be about your feelings.  Just something you guys have in common...like maybe school, class, etc.  Good luck and keep us posted.|`|24b54e28961d51b5f80ac2bb8478388aaa	I'm going to assume your in high school, since you mentioned that your friends blabbed this info. Usually you find blabbers in all ages but it seems to be more common in high school. <br>  <br>  As afraid as you are, guys are much more afraid. Men have a lot of pride and big egos. Rejection is one of their biggest fears. So a lot of times you won't find men going up to girls unless they know for sure they won't be rejectect or after a few drinks, which lowers their inhibitions, but don't try that, that's not a suggestion.<br>  <br>  Don't rely on rumors that say that he liked you. Instead make it obvious to him that you like him. And be on talking terms with him. Like if you know his friends and you have friends that know him, come up as group whenever you guys see each other and mingle. And pretend as though you have no idea he might know that you like him, or that someone blabbed it to him. This is so to open the lines of conversations up.<br>  <br>  When you talk to him, look him in the eyes and smile, especially when he's talking about himself. Men love women that listen and take interest in what they say.<br>  <br>  Oh and also if you ever see him in a crowded setting, stare at him from the side. After a while he might be thinking that someones staring at him and then he'll turn to look to see who it is. When he turns to look, you look the other way.  Do this at a couple of settings over time and he'll know for sure that you really like him. And then he'll muster up the courage to talk to you.<br>  <br>  Don't rush anything.  The chase is what really fuels guys. And you seem to pretty patient.<br>  <br>  Also try to find his aim screenname and text him. I'm sure it'll be easier for you to talk to him online.<br>  <br>  Good Luck. With Love and Prayers, Smitha|`|2d02a06cf59ca9c243a8244985be892aaa	If he knows you like him then let him make the first move.

4fb6b213e9e9a08fcc63cd6c1a0cf2f6aa	Well, yes it is normal to feel the way you are feeling... but maybe she is happy since she was betryed by the man who was suppose to love her and only her... Maybe those skeltons where to much for her...............................<br>  <br>  <br>  Just love you mother and respect her because she has good reasons for acting the way she is an doing what makes her feel happy.....|`|EPfpkXC7aa	Actually, it's very common for a widow to meet someone very soon after their spouse dies.  Have you tried to talk to your mom about your feelings?  A lot of times when things are too painful to think about, we tend to put our focus elsewhere and it sounds like this is what your mom may be doing.<br>  You are not wrong for feeling the way that you feel; you have just experienced a great loss and your feelings are completely normal.  Maybe talking to a counselor may help or some sort of grief therapy.  I think you need to be open and honest with your mom though about your feelings and go from there.  I am so sorry for your loss.  Good luck to you and take care.|`|026407cde2bc8691b34593dbabae7e6eaa	It doesn't matter what you feel about your mom's behaviour and relationships.  Trying to persuade her would leave a lot of bitterness on the table.  People have odd ways of dealing with grief.  When people are married a long time, sometimes they need to test their appeal and worthiness to the opposite sex.  Give her time and space.|`|QbexYHbcaa	You can feel any emotion you wish.

d9idmHoBaa	Try to be a good friend to the one you love.... women have a tendency to love people they know can be a trustworthy friend first.... watch her reactions and then ask her out when the time seems right. - As far as her twin who's head-over-heels for you, my best advice is to try and be a good friend to her too, just let her know you don't feel that way for her. If you get one of the twins hating you, you're not likely to get the other to date you.<br>  <br>  Try being friends to both and slowly intoduce you feelings ( or lack of feelings) to both of them when the time seems right.|`|AA11375687	What is your question?

No one should have made you promise to keep you together because you are a child and dependent on other's for your care.  That's wrong.  You see that, don't you?  Try to give your grandfather a break because sometimes people have to do things to protect themselves for harm.  It's called tough love and maybe your brother needs a dose of it.

You might find out you don't care for him like you once did.|`|Zso1AnxQaa	It sounds like he isn't over your completely, if he's trying to contact your twin sister who just so happens to look like you (I'm guessing?).<br>  Also, he's looking at your profile pics to probably see what is new with you and if you're with anyone right now.<br>  He's defiently not  over you, but he's being immature,using your twin sister to get to you.

Hang out with a new/diff group of frends, volunteer at your church or school without that person, even stay home become closer to your parents.  Or join a sport, just try to get more active with people that doesnt include the one you cant get over.  Once you start having fun without them you'll feel like you dont need them...which you probably dont.<br>  <br>  goodluck with that!|`|5cacd7c3cb34247904392e2c743bbde7aa	it sure is hunni, just hang in there.  time helps, go out with your friends, the mist does lift eventually.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|70a47f94503a1953542e060626fbb52caa	my heart goes out to you!! but you will have to move on and forget. time will heal.<br>  many years ago I had a friend. he was my best friend. after a year of being friends we started a sexual relationship. It felt weird at first because for a long time with was just friends and out of the blue we started a sexual relationship which only lasted 6 weeks. when we split up my world was turn upside down. I not only lost a friend, a best friend but a lover. It took me 2 years to get over him. I forgot to say that the reason it felt weird is because he was gay and i never in my wildest dreams expect to have a sexual relationship with a gay man whom was my best friend. true true story honest!!<br>  good luck to you and so so sorry and email me if you wish to let me know how you are and if you want to talk about it.|`|AA11903783	If you know so well that you can't have someone then forget all about her and move on. Man, there are so many girls in your town or city and surely forgetting one will lead you to meet a thousand more. Do not waste your time on something you cannot have but try to work on something to build the relationship with somebody who will give you a chance for things to work out. It's not hard as you think it is.|`|VDMZhQLTaa	Write how you feel in a diary, that helped me when i could not have someone i really wanted. Go out with your friends and take your mind off it. If you are in contact with the person you cannot have - then tell them not to text/call you as often as you need a bit of space. Good luck, been there too! xxx|`|b5499b1354d6a6233719aa99aad2e334aa	hey,,,,,  you have to cut off all comunication with that person,,, so, no phone calls, no text messages, no IM,,,,  nothing! <br>  <br>  Avoid seeing him in person at all costs (if you can't avoid it, then consider a new job, if it's really bad)<br>  <br>  Then each time you think of him, tell yourself, that its ok, to think about him, but then find something to take your mind off him.... <br>  <br>  Eventually, after maybe a few weeks or a month, you will find other things in your life that will fill the void.<br>  <br>  So be sure to contact alot of your old friends who you have put on hold for this guy....

He will probably never change, you will be having to check in with him for the rest of your life.

If she makes fun of you, she isn't even worth calling a 'friend'. Don't sweat yourself over her. I bet there are other people who are willing to be your friends and not make fun of you. Or maybe she's just jealous of you and that's why she makes fun of you. Whatever, it is she shouldn't be doing it in the first place. Ask her why she is doing that.

05116125f9efaf15742153e9b7c38a35aa	I'm kind of going through the same situation where my best friend and fiance don't get along at all. This is how i think of it, if this were a true friend, she would understand that when a person is engaged or married, you can't dedicate as much time to her. It's not that you've changed, it's just your priorities are different. At least you're still making the effort to spend time with friends. A reason that you're friend might not be too happy is because she's jealous, or wants what you have. She won't understand that you can't spend as much time with her until she is engaged herself. A couple, especially a serious one, should have time to themselves, THEN time for everyone else. If she doesn't learn to accept it, she's not a true friend.|`|0436b573cfbd3ce6cb729bb40d6c8227aa	if u really love your fiance' don't worry about what ur friends think. they will come to there senses at some point. don't let them come between u and ur fiance's relationship.|`|AA11903092	tell them that you relaly love your fiance and that it is important that you spend lots of time with her. start a plan. like what day you hang out with your friend and wat day u hang out with your fiance. tell your fiance that your friend is important to you as she is. if she really love you, she'll understand. best of luck to you!|`|aec8fc43693d05607ccff83bc66858cbaa	maybe they are jealous.|`|e9b6dca0e0528c0ec4623c10b8d5236caa	it's wonderful that you're engaged, but it's also wonderful to have friends. if you're happy with your fiancé, why should you care about what they think? sit down and have a talk with your friends. tell them that, although you're engaged, at least you try to make the effort to think about them. if they still don't appreciate your attempts to spend time with them (even if it is just once a week), you don't need them as your friends. friends support each other. obviously these friends don't support you.|`|5447ef9f064fa150d15e8e98d44eb219aa	give your friends a chance to mature. unfortunately, your best friend is your fiance. and that does pose jealousy. they have been replaced, more than likely permanently. they know they will never have that closeness they had before. sad, but true. friends come and go. some you will keep forever. just be strong. it will get better.|`|f34f4f025cc56607001373270581d5b2aa	They just need to get over it.

They probably want to keep things just the way they were.<br>  <br>  There is nothing you can do, unless you want to call off the engagement....and that really isn't a solution, because as time passes, other friends in the group will start to fall out and have relationships on thier own.<br>  <br>  It is all part of growing up and maturing.

17c5cb2366dbbc2e1e1056108e3a28d3aa	While I cannot disagree with your sentiments about American women more strenuously, you have accurately described the *stereotyped*, idealized Asian female.<br>  <br>  The popularity of the image of the eternally youthful, submissive (i.e., feminine in the traditional, patriarchal sense), hard working, and appreciative (i.e., she knows her place) woman is due to three factors:<br>  <br>  1) American involvement in the Pacific front during World War II, when many grunts involved with the pacification of Pacific nations took Asian wives. In the US, these wives were accepted as rescued women - very traditionally feminine, indeed. Vietnam and Korea accelerated this image. (If you pay attention, you'll notice that a similar fetish is developing around Arabic and South Asian women right now . . . anything to do with the Middle East? Yes.)<br>  <br>  2) Asians have become a "model minority" in the US - in other words, they have more successfully met white, middle-class standards of lifestyle than other groups. This is largely because there is no taboo against interracial white-Asian marriages - a product of WWII and Vietnam. Because of this, many white men who might otherwise be against interracial marriage find Asian women to be acceptable mates.<br>  <br>  3) Perceptions that other women are becoming more manly are probably reactions to American women's increasing independence and power in this country. For men who prefer the more "traditional" or submissive style of femininity, Asian women - whose race bears the baggage I've described above - present an alternative to independent women. This is *not* to say that Asian women are actually more submissive, cuter, or any of that. That's a stereotype, and a damaging one at that!<br>  <br>  While I haven't personally noticed any decrease in the appreciation of other kinds of women, Asian women have, over the past fifty years or so, become more and more accepted in the US as the very epitome of femininity. It really has nothing to do with Asian women being objectively more beautiful or more feminine than other women - it has everything to do with the history of race relations, gender relations, and warfare in the US.|`|AA11950087	No sorry.

8446b0bd7a0c5d7795039d6c92b20599aa	You basically answered your own question: "..but I need to move on!" That's half the battle. I think the best advice would be to learn from the past and meet someone else that will meet your needs. There are many ladies out there that have just ended relationships like your's and are looking for new friendships. I don't know what your age is, but go where people hangout and get to know new friends. Expand your horizons. Try new things and you'll definitely meet someone else. You seem to be a sensitive kind of guy. You shouldn't have any problems meeting the right lady. As for the past, it's in the past. Leave it alone. You can always learn from mistakes. That's what experience is. You will be wiser for it, and if it's something she did to you, you'll know that the main thing in a relationship is communication. Just be open, friendly, accessible, be yourself, and good things should happen. Good luck.|`|AA12268785	reunion  AFTER BREAKING UP   is like eating your vomit just imagine it u will forget her in 10 seconds|`|1f52b601f0b34b6eea69d16f07f8b09eaa	Good things are really hard to forget.  May be you can focus on your interests like sports, arts and other things that will make you think about other things. Prioritize things and you will realize that not moving on is really useless. Talk with other people and socialize with them.

Ponder who initiated the end of relations. Try to find who was most at fault. Try to find out if your ex-girlfriend is dating someone else or if she is still single. Maybe then you will be able to decide if it is worthwhile going back to her or then make up your mind just to discard her like an old pair of shoes.|`|f8372c942b97ecd619d9fe6d98b610abaa	How to forget an ex?<br>  <br>  You can still love her.....be loyal to her in memory only.

b1d2f5cb299a38a3d1c2d9d79b9b7939aa	I asked my husband the same question (minus the red eyes...never saw that one before) as he is a black man and I am a white woman.  I'm not fat nor did I ever buy him shoes or let him drive my car.  I'm a successful woman with a master's degree and he's successful as well so there was nothing to gain by dating me.  He told me that black men usually date white, heavy women because of two reasons: 1.  Black men don't have an issue with heavier women.  What a white man would consider "heavy" a black man would find completely okay.  2.  The really heavy women aren't a challenge and can usually be walked on by other black men.  They can cheat on the women and because she usually doesn't have a lot of self confidence he knows she won't be going anywhere anytime soon.  Now, this is just a generalization...this isn't ALL black men or ALL heavy women.|`|3769ef89a1457fcf254b42fa731e9e49aa	okay?|`|970b0702bf9f936ceed5eb8cda79cea5aa	LOL good luck having this question stay up for more than a few minutes!|`|aa309a7c984e63c2422c5abd6730e942aa	Red eyes??|`|c65403b2b25890f51f5252b7f62f00b4aa	cant blame the guy for trying to get some shizzel for his nizzel. lol|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	Maybe he's high on drugs or drunk?

f229493a64909652c272653a7f69c9c5aa	Hi there !!!<br>  You say you do not like to go out, because you do not like to go out alone. Understandable, but if you were to go to places like a museaum, movies, book store, gym, supermarket, church ectt. you might find girls that <br>  a_ have the same interests as you or similar<br>  b- get back into the flow of socializing which is good for us<br>  c-feel better about yourself<br>  <br>  I would go to places and enjoy myself, visualize yourself meeting someone with your interests,, qualities you want to find in a woman, then just thank God, believe you received it and let it go. Then I would just be a happy golucky guy and go out , have fun, live life happy and voila something will show up. <br>  Physical appereance might matter for like a first impression, but you know what, beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, and our physical appereance it not everything, our personality, the essence of who we are is much sexier and attractive. Just remember to always have a clean and neat appereance, that says a lot of the person , if they take care of themselves (nails too)<br>  Have security in yourself, think of the qualities you have,and be happy.<br>  I pray you will find what you are looking for,<br>  just remember to be careful what you ask for.<br>  Love light and peace|`|8590bc79d4912424e516a2d2ba820a01aa	i can be a friend for any who want my email;salman_aya@yahoo.com im from israelmy name|`|d914cebc8371b4ae121d2f2cfca0aa38aa	There is nothing wrong with the way you are, there is someone out there for you, love will find you. <br>  <br>  Take care|`|e60b77f6ccb3b3608a0125fcf2a8f7f2aa	You can e-mail me if you like.<br>  <br>  adb0423@yahoo.com|`|469938505cd53615e50f1d0d1b8bb2c3aa	Unfortunately not going out much is your main problem. How do you expect to meet people if you don't go out? I know it can be a drag going somewhere on your own, but what about some group or club where you wouldn't be the only single person (and I don't necessarily mean a singles club either). Another great way to meet people is actually online. Though at times a lot of trust is needed to believe what some say.. lol Do you have any male friends you could go out with? No silly, not on a date. But one just to get out with, have fun with and perhaps even meet others. I'm married, and happily, but heck feel free to email me if you wish. :)|`|e5e6e36915361e9d61f4bd9866fd01f0aa	You sound like you have so much going for you.<br>  <br>  I know how hard it is to meet people when you don't go out much.  I stay inside alot too.  But out there really is where they are you know.<br>  <br>  If you join a class or a group where your interests lie (maybe writing, cooking or an obedience class for your dogs) you will meet people and not be alone (or at least no more alone that anyone else).<br>  <br>  Please try.  Join something.  Don't waste a good life typing when you could be talking to people, romancing a lovely woman.<br>  <br>  Me?  I'm stuck honey.  Disabled due to a spinal injury and recently diagnosed with MS I'm relegated to those forced to communicate this way.  I can get out but it's harder for me.<br>  <br>  So don't piss me off.  Don't waste something I wish I had.  Go meet some new people and count your blessings.  You deserve every single one of them.

Unfortuneatly, if you're family doesn't approve, I'd say, respect their wishes. Seven years at your age is quite a difference and not something easy to ignore. Yet, it will get easier once you grow older. Try looking around for someone your own age and don't jump to quick conclusions. This 28 year old isn't neccessarily your soul-mate. there are other fish in the sea. Go fishing =D   !!

I believe there is a HUGE line between public and intimacy. Shyness in public, if your with a guy, leads him to think you're almost ashamed to be with him. Just with friends, they may think you are insecure with yourself. Intimately, you should be shy untill you're about in your early 20's.

Testosterone is produced in the ovaries.  The reason you may consider talking with your doctor is because in very rare circumstances a tumor near the ovaries can cause an increase in testosterone and so you may want to check this out.  I'm talking rare so don't start worrying<br>  <br>  The bottom line is that your sexual drive is caused by hormones, a physical part of your body that has nothing to do with your thinking and what is truly you.  <br>  <br>  First of all you obviously need an attentive sexual partner.  Communicate clearly your sexual needs.  A loving partner will do everything he can do to satisfy you.<br>  <br>  Also, with a higher than normal sex drive, be responsible in life.  If you give it up too quickly in a new relationship be cognizant that this new person will classify you as being easy, which may affect a possible future relationship.<br>  <br>  So, talk with your partner, tell him why you have a higher than normal sex drive and work on the issue together.

Its when your focus is on what you like about another.

Love generally includes an emotion of intense attraction to either another person, a place, or thing; and may also include the aspect of caring for or finding identification with those objects, including self-love. Love can describe an intense feeling of affection, an emotion or an emotional state. In ordinary use, it usually refers to interpersonal love, an experience usually felt by a person for another person. Love is commonly considered impossible to define.<br>  <br>  The concept of love, however, is subject to debate. Some deny the existence of love, calling it a recently invented abstraction. Others maintain that love exists but is indefinable; being a quantity which is spiritual, metaphysical, or philosophical in nature. The views that love does not exist or is indefinable may underlie the fact that approximately 13 percent of cultures have no word for love. [1] [2] The remaining 87 percent attempt to define this abstract concept and apply it to everyday life. Love is one of the most common themes in art and often times is an excuse for " bad art". Some psychologists maintain that love is the abstract action of lending one's "boundary" or "self esteem" to another<br>  Overview<br>  <br>  Love has several different meanings in the English language, from something that gives a little pleasure to something for which one would die. And in contrast to the definition at the top, frequently people use the verb "love" to indicate want or desire for themselves as opposed to for another. For example: "I love that lamp," does not refer to desiring wellness for the lamp, but rather to the desire for the lamp. The word also frequently indicates elevated appreciation or admiration: "I love that artist," An individual might state.<br>  <br>  Cultural differences make any universal definition of love difficult to establish. Expressions of love may include the love for a soul or mind, the love of laws and organizations, love for a body, love for nature, love of food, love of money, love for learning, love of power, love of fame, and love for the respect of others. Different people place varying degrees of importance on the kinds of love they receive. Love is essentially an abstract concept, easier to experience than to explain. Many believe, as stated originally by Virgil that "Love conquers all", or as stated by The Beatles, "All you need is love". Bertrand Russell describes love as a condition of 'absolute value', as opposed to 'relative value'.<br>  <br>  <br>  Types<br>  <br>  <br>  Courtly love – a late medieval conventionalized code prescribing certain conduct and emotions for ladies and their lovers <br>  Erotic love – desire characterized by sexual desires <br>  Familial love – affection brokered through kinship connections, intertwined with concepts of attachment and bonding <br>  Free love – sexual relations according to choice and unrestricted by marriage <br>  Platonic love – a close relationship in which sexual desire is nonexistent or has been suppressed or sublimated <br>  Puppy love – romantic affection that is not "mature" or not "true." The term reflects a bias that love between youngsters is somehow less valid. <br>  Religious love – devotion to one's deity or theology <br>  Romantic love – affection characterized by a mix of emotional and sexual desire <br>  True love - love without condition, motive or attachment. Loving someone just because they are themselves, not their actions or beliefs in particular. <br>  Unrequited love – affection and desire not reciprocated or returned <br>  <br>  Scientific views<br>  <br>  Throughout history, predominantly, philosophy and religion have speculated the most into the phenomenon of love. In the last century, the science of psychology has written a great deal on the subject. Recently, however, the sciences of evolutionary psychology, evolutionary biology, anthropology, neuroscience, and biology have begun to take centre stage in discussion as to the nature and function of love.<br>  <br>  Biological models of sex tend to see it as a mammalian drive, just like hunger or thirst. Psychology sees love as more of a social and cultural phenomenon. Psychologist Robert Sternberg created his Triangular theory of love and argued that love has three different components : Intimacy, Commitment, and Passion. Intimacy is a form where two people can share secrets and various details of their personal lives. Intimacy is usually shown in friendships and romantic love affairs. Commitment on the other hand is the expectation that the relationship is going to last forever. The last and most common form of love is simply sex, or passion. Passionate love is shown in infatuation as well as romantic love. This led researchers such as Yela to further refine the model by seperating Passion into two independents components : Erotic Passion and Romantic Passion.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cultural views<br>  <br>  Although there exist numerous cross-cultural unified similarities as to the nature and definition of love, as in there being a thread of commitment, tenderness, and passion common to all human existence, there are differences. For example, in India, with arranged marriages commonplace, it is believed that love is not a necessary ingredient in the initial stages of marriage – it is something that can be created during the marriage; whereas in Western culture, by comparison, love is seen as a necessary prerequisite to marriage.<br>  <br>  <br>  Religious views<br>  <br>  Love, in the form of subjective devotion, seems to have been originally understood as the proper response to idealised objective natural forces (pagan polytheism). Later religions shifted the emphasis towards single abstractly-oriented objects like God, the law, the book, and the church (formalised monotheism).<br>  <br>  Alongiside these two objects of subjective human love (mono and poly), there a third view which recognises a state or truth distinct from (and often antagonistic to) the idea that there is a difference between the subject and the object (pantheism). Love is reality itself, of which we, moving through time, imperfectly interprete ourselves as isolated part.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Definitional issues<br>  Dictionaries tend to define love as deep affection or fondness.[3] In colloquial use, according to polled opinion, the most favoured definitions of love include the words:[4]<br>  <br>  life - someone or something for which you would give your life. <br>  care - someone or something about which you care more than yourself. <br>  In common use, care refers to a mental or emotional state of predisposition in which one has an interest or concern for someone or something. To care for someone, may also refer to a disquieted state of mixed uncertainty, apprehension, and responsibility; or a cause for such anxiety. Caring for an object, such as a house, refers to a state of attendant maintenance; or may also refer to a state of charge or supervision, as in under a doctor’s care. <br>  friendship - favoured interpersonal associations or relationships. <br>  union <br>  family - people related via common ancestry. <br>  bond.

A great deal of responsibility is also put on the shoulders of everyone in the public eye and those who are considered role models. Having been in an enviable and privileged position previously with her band, she should have known what was/is expected of her with regard to her personal conduct.<br>  <br>  Life is full of learning experiences which gives us the opportunity to learn from any mistakes we make, refine our character and ultimately, become better people.<br>  <br>  It's true, people need to be corrected when they make a mistake such as this, in the hope that they don't repeat it. But to be continually punished for it is wrong. All will be forgiven in time although not forgotten.|`|3mFsE93qaa	I think the way Davina treated her on her interview was awful, she was so nasty to her.  I think Jo was misunderstood.

I dont think that any of them were necessarily being racist they were all just being bitchy however when Jade was having her rant one of them should have told her that she was going too far it was unfortunately a classic case of a bully being supported by others who were too scared too stand up to her, but I do think that too much is being made of it and I wonder if the same fuss would have been caused had it been the other way round!!

b5b26df8e4d3363ba97caa423b1ba753aa	i say before valentine's day, for a couple of reasons:<br>  - There's so much pressure on that day, it makes people go crazy.<br>  - Maybe you're not the only one who's planning to send him an gift, and they might not be anonymous! You need to get ahead of the game.<br>  - If he likes you back, you guys can do something together on Valentine's Day :]<br>  <br>  Flirt with him at the lunch date, and see how he responds. If it goes well, look for an opening to tell him that you like him - or ask him out on a date this weekend, or next week. If that goes well too, then you can opt for a Valentine's Day date. <br>  It may be hard to reveal your feelings, you might be scared, but it's all about signals. If you feel that he's having a good time and seems like he would be open to another date, then go ahead and ask!

While she's going through her treatment you're going to have to put your anomsity towards her on the back burner.  If you try to get your husband to stop "helping" her, you're going o look bad in his eyes.  If you say anything negative about her right now, you're going to look bad in his eyes. <br>  <br>  The best thing to do is to just ride it out and be as supportive as you can to him and his kids.  Once she's cleared and in recovery, then you and he can move forward with your lives and if he has any brain cells, he'll think the world of you for making it easy for him.  He'll know that he is married to the most amazing woman in the world because you proved it to him by standing by him when he was trying to be there for her.  <br>  <br>  If you want to complain or anything, talk to your closest confidentes only.

I mean, she can't be THAT bad, he was married to her and had two kids with her, after all! It will be helpful if you accept that the situation isn't likely to change; otherwise you're setting yourself up for a lot of stress and disappointment.|`|AA11539824	It sounds like she still has feelings for him and is using her illness to get closer to him. (playing the sympathy card.) You need to be honest with your husband and tell him exactly how you feel before your anger builds up and boils over. The cancer is curable and she has a support group outside of him. He should continue to allow the children to see her as much as possible but distance himself otherwise. It might be a good time to get in touch with a GOOD Family law attorney and look at changing the custody arrangement. It appears that you and your husband are in a better position to take care of the children than she is and should anything happen to her you would be in a better position. This would also end your husbands child support obligation bringing more money into your home. I would not hesitate to do this in light of how she previously treated you.|`|U9JDSPFTaa	Remind your husband that you are married to him now. I know how you feel. Cause my in laws are like your husband's ex. They feel that he should do things for them all the time...like he's their personal assistant or something. If I were you I would go to court and have custody switch from her to you guys. There is no way you should be paying her child support if you have the children. That's crazy. If she throws a fit about it...just tell her that when she gets better you would be willing to let her have full custody again.

I would let him read it, and see his reaction.  You should be able to go to the courts and stop payment if you are keeping them full time.  Even though they say the cancer is curable, it may not turn out that way.  Pretty much, you will always have to deal with this since they have two children together.  Open up and be honest, it may just make you feel better to actually express how you feel about it to him, it will make you all stronger.  Counseling may be a good idea for you, him, and the kids, this is a hard one. good luck.|`|bacb96dfe9b19c816d378ee4a9423a9faa	She's afraid. Sure she was ruthless, but she is dying.

AA11332585	When you say your Mom has a new boyfriend, I am guessing that she and your Dad where together as some point. I believe you are mad because your life was ripped away. When parents split up it always damages the children the most. You had no control over what was going on and no  one asked your opinion. Now your Mom is with someone else and still no one is asking you what you think and what want. It feels as if is your Mom is getting a new life that doesn't include you, and she is forcing it on you. Your emotions are all over the place, most adults I know couldn't even deal with all the emotions you are dealing with right now. In life you most give away what you want the most. If you want love you must give it away. But really the person you want to fill love from is your Mom. Giving love to a boy is not going to give you the results your looking for. Try to look for the good things about your life. Tell you Mom you love her, and try to do things that show that. And your stepdad, try to respect him just because your Mom loves him. Really you have a decision to make you can continue to be angry and make it difficult for everyone to be around you including your friends. Or you can accept that sometime life sucks. Then make the best out of what you do have. I hope that helps. And you can always go to God in prayer.|`|Sl2LFpA9aa	God and pills are just pat answers that probably won't make you feel much better.  Try focusing on yourself: your own aspirations, the things that make you happy, and make sure you are doing some of those things.  Maybe you enjoy the arts, dancing, writing down your thoughts, cooking, sports... just pick one thing that everytime you are upset you can fall back on and put some energy into.  <br>    Then once you are feeling a little better about your own state of mind, if there are still things about your mother that are upsetting you, try talking to her about them calmly and earnestly.  You'll be able to express yourself more clearly if you aren't really upset at the beginning, and she will respect you more.  Good luck!|`|ZQq9YIUAaa	i been in that situation when i was 13 i even try to commit suicide but now i am 23 and i think i was over reacting i was jealous. relax and pray. that helps a lot|`|f64f2f5a0ded3a078f8740af72ec5b47aa	Seek God!

When you try to explain and she tells you, "you are being stupid"  I think what she really is saying is that she doesn't know how to help you.

Other popular sites to be married in Santa Barbara include the Rose Garden, right across from the Mission, the beach (well, obviously, but I wouldn't recommend it because many of our beaches are pretty dirty and crowded), San Ysidro Ranch, the Biltmore, Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History has extensive grounds as well.

9e2b4ef1d830430018f77a9406d19e99aa	I agree w/DrRJP.  Divorce is devastating. If you love someone, you should never hope they have to go through a divorce. The best way for you personally to cope is to look inside yourself. Quotes like "the first time that I have been in love in all my years of dating" and "I have never really experienced mutual love before" make it sound like you have relational issues? You say you have never really been in love mutually until this friend, who is essentially unavailable. Also, you have been out of the country, so the relationship could not have been all that intimate, but it did give you a chance at a "safe" romance. Your friend probably just needed someone close to confide in and you took advantage of that. Now you are "devastated", giving yourself yet another reason you will never truly be able to find love. Very tragic. <br>  Hint: Love is not selfish.|`|AA12187979	Don't date someone that is seperated.|`|qthjey1jaa	I hate to say it, but falling in love with a married person, even one who has filed for divorce is a bad situation and should never have happened in the first place. Even if she could break clean and had no health problems, the chances for the two of you having a successful relationship are slim. I'm not even raising the issue of whether it is right or wrong...just the reality.<br>  <br>  I know that this doesn't ease your pain, but you have to understand that it will be the best for everyone concerned. I'm sure you've heard about the downsides of "rebound relationships." This is one of them.|`|856f9f629e121d326752210489850fd9aa	What in the world is the difference between loving a person, and being attached to them? Love is the sincere wish, for others to be happy for others and free from suffering. Having realistically realized other’s kindness, as well as their faults, Love is Always focused on the other person’s welfare. We have no ulterior intensions or motives to fulfill our own self-interests; or to fulfill our own desires, we love others, all people, simply because they exist. Attachment, on the other hand, exaggerates others’ good qualities, and makes us crave to be with them. When we’re with them, we are happy, but when we’re separated from them, we’re miserable. Attachments are always linked with expectations of what others should be, or what they should do for us. Is love, as it is understood in most societies, really love OR attachment ? Let us examine this a little more. Generally speaking, we are attracted {drawn to) people because they have qualities we value, or because they help us in some way. If we carefully observe, through introspection, our own thought processes we’ll notice that we very often look for specific qualities in others. Some of these qualities we are drawn to are qualities within our parents,  or  qualities which society values.<br>  We examine someone’s looks, education, social status, financial status, and so forth. This is how Most of us decide on whether or not the person holds any true value, or not. In addition, we judge people as worthwhile according to how they relate to us. If they praise us, encourage us, help us, if they listen to what we have to say, if they make us feel secure, if they take care of us when were sick, unhappy or depressed, we consider them good, or sometimes righteous people, and these are the people we more drawn to, whom we are most likely attracted to, and the people we choose to be around with.<br>  In all honesty, this is very biased, for we are judging them, only in terms of how they relate to us, as if we are the most important person in the world & thinking the world revolves around us! After we’ve judged certain people to be good for us, whenever we see them, it appears to us as if goodness is radiating out from within them, but as we are more mindfully aware, we realize that we have projected this goodness on to them.<br>  Desiring to be the people who make us feel good, we become emotional yo-yo’s, when we’re with these people, we’re up, but when we’re not with them, we’re down. Furthermore, we form fixed concepts of what our relationships with these people will be, and thus have expectations of them. “When they do not live up to our expectations of them, we’re unhappy, disappointed or may even become angry. We want them to change so that they will match what we think they are. But our projections and expectations come from our own minds, not from other people. Our problems arise not because others aren’t who we thought they were, but because we mistakenly thought they were something they were not. We often use a type of Checklist also. Checklist: “I Love You IF ___________ !” This Love is Conditional and what we call love, is most often attachment. It is actually an attitude which overestimates the qualities of another person.<br>  ’Then we cling tightly to that person, thinking our peace and happiness depends on that person. We even often blame that person for our unhappiness.’ Love, on the other hand, is a very patient, calm, optimistic and relaxed attitude. We want others to be free from suffering and to be happy simply because they exist. While attachments are uncontrolled, and too emotionally sentimental, Love is Patient, powerful, and controlled(disciplined). Attachment obscures our judgment {our ability to make sound, wise decisions), and we become impatient, angry, and impartial – helping our dear ones, and those who do us no harm. Love clarifies our mind, & we access a situation by thinking of the greatest good for everyone. Attachment is based on selfishness, while love is founded on valuing, & cherishing others, even those who do not look very appealing to us. Love always looks beyond all the superficial appearances and dwells on the fact that they are just like us: they want peace of mind, happiness, and wish to avoid suffering. If we see unattractive, or unintelligent people we most often feel repulsed, because our selfish minds want to find attractive, intelligent, and talented people. On the other hand, Love never evaluates others by theses superficial standards and looks much deeper into the person. Love recognizes that regardless of the others appearances, they’re experiences are they same as ours: they want inner mental peace, happiness, and wish to be from suffering. When we’re attached, we’re not mentally, emotionally, & spiritually free. For we overly depend on, and cling to another person, to fulfill our emotional, mental, and spiritual needs. We fear losing the person, fearing that we’d be incomplete without them.” This does Not mean that we should suppress all our emotional needs, or become aloof, and totally independent, for that too would not solve the problem. We must simply realize our unrealistic needs and slowly, gently and patiently – seek to eliminate them. If we try to suppress them, pretending they do not exist, we become insecure, anxious, or possibly depressed. In this case, we do our best to fulfill our needs, while simultaneously working gradually to subdue them. The core problem is that most of us seek to be loved, rather than to love. We yearn to be understood by others, rather than to understand them. Our sense of emotional insecurities comes from the selfish obscuring of our own minds. We develop confidence by recognizing our inner potential to become a Selfless human being, having many magnificent qualities, then we’ll develop and have an accurate perception of ourselves, gaining self-confidence. We’ll seek to increase true unconditional love, to increase compassion, to cultivate patience, as well as generosity, right concentration and wisdom. Under the influence of attachment, we’re bound by our unstable emotional reactions to others. When they’re nice to us, we’re happy, but when they ignore us or speak sharply to us, we take it personally, and are unhappy. But pacifying attachment doesn’t mean we become hard-hearted, rather without attachments, there will be space in our hearts and minds for genuine affection and impartial love for them. And as a result, we’ll be more actively involved with them. As we learn to transform our minds & lives, through subduing our attachments, we can definitely have successful friendships, and personal relationships with others. These relationships will be richer, more meaningful because of the freedom and respect the relationships are based on. We’ll really care about the happiness and misery of all human beings equally, simply because everyone is the same inside: we all want inner peace of mind, Happiness, and to be from suffering. <br>  However, of course, our lifestyles and interests may be a bit more compatible with some people. Our friendships and our personal relationships will be based on mutual interests, and to help other people. Having such an attitude, we’ll be much More Patient, & tolerant toward others; will remain mentally calm, having Peace of Mind and Happiness, and we’ll communicate successfully with others in life.|`|AA11474975	If you believe in prayer, that's what I think you should do.<br>  I feell so bad for you, but if it is meant to be then it will happen.

Can their unreconciled difference be changed? This is the BIG risk you take when you get involve with someone who is still married.<br>  <br>  The "mutual" love is not lost. She call off the divorce so that she can get medical treatment. Relax, she is doing the right thing.  Getting help for her illness is her first priority.

879c1752d93d34942cbc3ecd894f0f43aa	It sounds to me like you have already decided to leave him. Otherwise there would never have been infidelity to begin with. It sounds like neither of you are happy so why not get out while you have the rest of your lives to be happy. Just because he is being nice now doesn't mean he will stay that way. Maybe both of you are in a comfort zone and that is why both of you stay. I am not saying divorce is the answer but take a long hard look at your current situation. If you are really unhappy then it isn't worth staying. Good luck.|`|c2dfad4dc1f663f9f98d8667a84e7f6daa	With the infidelity and physical fighting, there may be too much water under the bridge. I think at this point I would let go of the relationship.<br>  Your husband is snooping and accusing you of cheating so he doesn't trust you. He's throwing out the word "divorce" like it's not big deal. If it was, he'd talk about it when he came home.<br>  I'd be gone. I'd work on myself and if I was contributing to the physical abuse I would get some counseling to see how to get past it. Good luck.|`|a61d29f848346a3a635d768e9c48bb90aa	it sounds to me like your husband had something to be concerned about.  if you are considering leaving him for this guy that you aren't even going out with then it is something about to be serious.  if you never met this guy, would you be considering leaving your husband?   that is the question to ask, along with how long you think this guy is going to stick around after all the messiness of divorce with your husband.|`|8e7f855aa9f1f8e23cef12079dc4e9f7aa	i would see how things go with my husband over the next several weeks before i make any decisions. you obviously love your husband, if you didn't you would have already left. if things continue in the downward spiral then i would talk to him about everything and tell him that you feel it is time to part ways, hopefully as friends but if not it would be understandable.|`|Zso1AnxQaa	Well, who was the cheater and who was the one that was physically fighting?<br>  A good marriage is based upon honesty and communication, and what you need to do is be honest with him.<br>  If you can't be honest with him, why be with him at all?|`|ab58149e0e0dcca7a1ce70fb65c4b0ffaa	Try to work your marriage out first.  Number one, unless you have given him reason to think you are cheating he should have believed what you said.  Number two, he shouldn't haven been eavesdropping on your phone call.  Number three, he should not have jumped to conclusions and asked for a divorce just like that.  I would suggest going to counseling to deal with the infidelity and physical fighting issue.|`|c19caeaea348e2212c8b3b3cdf73bd5eaa	You should try to work things out first. But it sounds like you already have a plan B. Tell the other guy to back off a little for you to see if you can work things out. You are just getting some needed attention from the new guy . Don't let him take advantage of your bad situation at home. If the new guy is willing to wait, them call him once in awhile just to see how he's doing. Don't burn your bridges yet with the new guy.  <br>       Sometimes the one accusing their mate of cheating is the one cheating. I know personally you just have to cut your losses and move on.
e87f1c407f4d2389ce889a2002cff8d3aa	I would try to be his friend first, as part of a big group, rather than having to try to get him alone and talk to him.  I would get to know him and see if he likes you too.  Friends is a good first step.

042735ab287ff0a82f7a796b9074de52aa	I have a tickling fetish so I can speak from experience. I prefer being the tickler and I enjoy tying by ticklee to the bed.<br>  <br>  In your case, I think what you have on your hands is a communication problem.<br>  <br>  You should let him know that the intense tickling session was really detrimental to your health. You should put clear boundries as to how much tickling is acceptable and only under conditions you feel comfortable with. Being tied up to a bed and being tickled into a nervous breakdown pretty much has no boundries. You are letting him go as far as he wants.<br>  <br>  I would suggest maybe trying to control your ticklishness better by trying to hold out while being tickled lightly and WITHOUT bondage. Spend some time together tickling playfully. You can spend a session just on a foot for instance. Then move to another body part. You can slowly increase your resistance and at the same time I think your partner would enjoy it. Also, tickle him. If he is not ticklish, I recommend you look for a spot. The right pressure in the right place and you should get some reactions.<br>  <br>  Use a 'safeword' that invariably means STOP. This must be respected at all times. If he can't accept that then he will not respect you in other much more important ways. Make this clear to him.<br>  <br>  If you cannot stand being tickled at all and you really, really hate it, then I think there is little hope for your relationship. Tickling is an important part of my relationship and I do not consider myself to be on the extreme end of this fetish. My wife thinks its a little wierd but she goes along with it because she knows how important it is to me. If a tickle fetishist doesn't have that stimulous, I think 9 out of 10 times the relationship must fail.<br>  <br>  Good luck. As a ticklephile I really hope you find a way to open yourself to tickling. I know many non ticklephiles who have "converted" despite incredibly intense ticklishness. I wish that you and your partner are that fortunate.|`|d940b613c72e65dceb131f078c7f061eaa	The easy answer would be to say that you two are just not a match.  Even if he were willing to give up any hope of his ultimate satisfaction, would you really be able to accept knowing that you were depriving him of what he desperately wanted and needed?<br>  <br>  You could presumably both try very hard to find some other activity you could both enjoy and try to make it as good for him as tickling, but it doesn't seem incredibly likely to succeed if he really has a fetish.  It's possible, but somehow, if he could tickle you into a nervous breakdown and not stop before he went too far, he may not be the sort of person who could adopt such a line of conduct with success.|`|e87f1c407f4d2389ce889a2002cff8d3aa	You should only do what you feel happy to consent to in any relationship, and you health is a very good reason to give it a miss.  Maybe see if there is a compromise and you can tickle him!|`|AA11369069	Only do what also makes you happy. If there's no real pleasure in that torture, then you should NOT continue with it. If he would actually leave you just because you don't share his opinion on something (liking the tickle fetish) then you're honestly better without him. A guy who doesn't care for your thoughts and doesn't respect your opinions is NOT a guy worth sticking around with. <br>   Be open about it with him, don't be aggressive about it and put him on the defensive for what he likes, but let him know you're not into it, you openly tried to like it- but you just don't. He should be very happy you even were open-minded to try it in the first place.
fKwUDb7Iaa	It does seem unreal. No one truly knows who that person is on the other end of the 'net until they meet them. And with so many horror stories out about meeting strangers, you gotta be at least cautious.<br>  <br>  I've known 2 guys who met women over the Internet. One couple ended up living together for several  years, and broke up after having 2 kids together. The other couple married and are still living happily together. Neither couple met using the professional sites that are available now.  And hey, 50% worked out!  So, it's possible. <br>  <br>  I can see the appeal of it and the angst of it just feeling fake, missing something.  The jury's still out for me too.
NSukAVOvaa	I not really sure but i think its for the money. they dont care what he looks like if hes got a job or not. they just want every penny that comes in to his hands or just for the sex..im not sure how that is..cuz im only 14 but chyea..my mom had many boyfriends that i thought were losers but her new boyfriend is my BEST FRIEND we do everything together, fishing, biking, shopping, cook dinner,whatever..but women are just women lol|`|e87f1c407f4d2389ce889a2002cff8d3aa	I think that alot of women don't think they deserve someone good, whilst others like the thrill of the chase and the idea of 'taming' or changing someone wild and dangerous.  Either way - don't change who you are - we do eventually appreciate the better things in life.

People shouldn't say things like that. If u are that worried about it and it is affecting your selfesteem, u should think about getting some surgery or something. Your face looks great. People who look at someone nose when they are talking are rude. When u look at someone u should look in their eyes. God made us different and unique. There are some things about myself that i don't like, my hips, ***, thighs etc. Don't think about the things that make u self consious, focus on other features, like your eyes and personality, smile etc. Don't listen to immature kids who have nothing better to do than criticize ur looks. Beauty is what is in the soul. I don't have the highest self esteem.

Last remember to be soft and gentle when puckering,  taking your time and moving your tongue very slowly  when you feel theirs. Also when their tongue is in your mouth, pull back a little and tease the tip of their tongue with the tip of yours---tingly!

I know that it's hard to do but it will.  When guys spread something stupid like fart jokes, you make it even more pleasurable for them to do it by overreacting.  <br>  <br>  But since it's hard to not do anything, here's a suggestion: Since the guy you like is talking to your best friend (and I assume that your best friend knows the truth and that you trust him), have your best friend talk to him without your being there.  Man to man.  And then let it go.   He probably needs to hear it from another guy that everything is cool.  I hope this helps.|`|GUitXID3aa	hahaha, that's funny!!!!!!

In three years that happen and much more now emagine in 6 years? nomatter how much you love eachother you all won't be able to wait that long. Eventually somebody will break the chain or both. you can only tempt your self so much and to do so much. people change all the time and being without eachother is a major conflict... like i said ask her to move with you .. if she doesn't want to move on. you can't force things to be .. most of the things that are meant to be. tell her how you feel abou this and what this means for you. if you really think she is the one then give it a try if she's no the one she will pull a diffrent way. really you made a disition you weren't really ready for. at the time you were only thinking about your future and know your thinking about both... Remember that fear is not going to take you anywhere face your fears. Don't risk what you can't and know that is going to effect you so much .. risk what you think you can afford but don't be selfish make sure to talk to your partner about this.|`|df9a16eb4f516d196b59d94eaeeae163aa	You've been together for 3 years....time to sit down and discuss what you both want and decide where to go from there...<br>  you can't make this decision by yourself.<br>  communicate :)<br>  good luck!|`|xZG2ebkSaa	i think that maybe you need to think about weather you are eally in love with this girl or not. and you have to ask your self if you are ready to commit to her. i mean if your still young, and if your still not ready to give up the whole partyin single sean...then leave her there. but really talk about it. i mean she may not be ready to make that kind of move. i really hope you two r in love! cuz its the best feeling in the world! and i wish u the best of luck
e87f1c407f4d2389ce889a2002cff8d3aa	I think you meant guy - not gut! : )<br>  I would just make a point of hanging out when they are all around and getting to know him.  The best way to test things out is thru a mutual friend asking him.|`|a2JyMDpuaa	CANT BE DONE, just ask and hope its not too bad. lol
AA11438707	I wouldn't say you are correct, but I wouldn't say you are incorrect either.  I think its perfectly natural for you to have these feelings...they are legitimate concerns.  I also think, however, that it is important that you talk to him about these concerns.  It could be just that he feels comfortable and secure enough with you that he feels free to tell you about his past.  But if his anecdotes about his colorful past make you feel unappreciated and unhappy, tell him about it.|`|04731f93548b89b767b24225847e8de9aa	i totally think its normal for you to feel that way. i would too.|`|8sgfxIkCaa	yeah, the fact that he keeps mentioning his past is messed up... he sounds like a player. as hard as it is, either find a new guy or if you love this one then have a talk with him about you dont wanna be pressured in to doing anything and ask him to stop bringing up his sexual past cuz its not impressing you.|`|AA10363414	He a guy............|`|AA11597943	Some people are just more creative sexually and have had multiple partners...others are more conservative and less experimental. This is shaped by our personalities. I expect all his talk about his sexual past is to try and get you to open up more. To drop your inhibitions some and get freaky with him. I highly recommend it because it expands your horizons and what sex can be. However, you should also tell him that there needs to be compromise. You can be a freak sometimes but he has to not be pushy about it and become totally obsessed with sex either. It's about give and take. If you don't he will look elsewhere to get his rocks off....he needs the creative rush.|`|BoT5zWhtaa	He's a dummy. You never ever; talk about your sexual history,no matter what she says. I promise it will come back to haunt you.|`|cd08a1f25e7d8582a7de420cdbd326e0aa	that's the pitfall of good-looking guys. They won't appreciate sex as much as an ugly guy.|`|781d71752d258090b69b654451d07ecfaa	You are not wrong to feel that way at all. It is because he is proud of it. It's an achievment for him and he likes to remember those experiences. I did the exact thing and it was because I was proud that there were so many and they were so wild and crazy. I just kind of liked hearing the stories myself. I wasn't done having "fun". He may not be ready for soemething serious because when you find someone you truly love and want to be with, you forget about all those other things. I mean it's one thing to share stories and some information while getting to know each other but if he knows it upsets you and still does it then he may just not be ready and that's not a good thing. You can't change unwilling people and if he isn't ready to give up his past then sometimes it's better to just move on. Good luck.|`|130dba6dd4565d3d900d63269b7ab29baa	I think you are SO WRONG.... Unless he cheats, or cheating is in his past, you should NEVER hold anything a person has done (anything NOT illegal) against them. Its wrong for you to judge someone... You dont get that right. If you feel that insecure and have that low of self esteem, get help before you hurt this great guy...But realize that you WILL LOSE HIM if you keep on with the grudges. If he is a great guy otherwise... You would be a fool to let him go.|`|5a25a874fd157d42d5dab9b51465e809aa	remember the rule of 3 ... however many sexual experiences he has said he has had... divide by 3 and you will get the actual number. i don't think its appropriate for your guy to keep throwing his experiences in your face. you might want to reconsider if he is the real guy for you and see if you are only in love with the idea of being in love with him. consider what his motives are behind telling you all this. i'd kick him to the curb -- it's just not appropriate for him to do that. sure -- you should share info like that but not at the expense of making someone else feel bad.|`|7409e4cbb6391820c1736b4d807cd979aa	How you feel is how you feel which makes it real and valid.  You don't mention ages, but I'd say that he would consider being with you as special as he has considered it to be with anyone else.  What you need to do is talk to him in a non-confrontational way about how his bringing up his past makes you feel unappreciated.  If he cares he will do his best to deter speaking of it so much.  If he won't stop or says you are being to sensitive it's time for counseling or a new man.|`|qVMg9YRsaa	Well your feelings are better than mine. It wouldn't be touching me always bragging about his filthy past. Check him now or suffer later! You know he isn't right for talking to you about that all of the time.

That's it, that's all.<br>  Obviously he's toying with her and trying to toy with you at the same time. <br>  Wait him out, when he's done with her, he'll come your way if that's what you want to happen. Of course, you have to know that when he's all yours, along with all 120 pounds of testosterone, he'll more than likely flirt with her or someone else over your shoulder.<br>  He's a flirt and he's not serious about either of you it seems. Also, he could give a rat's booty about your friendship with the other girl. My question is do you value your friendship with her? If so, chill...if not proceed carefully realizing that Mr. is not ready for anything serious. He's just having fun.  <br>  So, keep it light and enjoy the attention. <br>  However, do realize that sometimes girls might get a little upset if they think you're flirting with their man, so keep your cool at all times. <br>  And, be open to other guys who are more available to you, you know the ones who do not have a girlfriend.    <br>  Enjoy!|`|DSbbT4QHaa	Next time he passes by, trip him on purpose and pretend it was an accident.

What if the shoe was on the other foot? He's going to continue to flirt with you but is going to keep his girlfriend. If he can have the both of you he's not going to choose. The best thing you can do is try to get over him before you get hurt.|`|6062e070bf7eb5061df725f054576a0eaa	This is a very competitive world we live in and alot of times you are going to like a guy who has a girlfriend already.  If you really like him, you need to continue to flirt like you are already doing and then maybe even take a chance and be a little more aggressive.  Guys love it when a girl is a little aggressive since it is so rare.  Yes, you will risk rejection, but if you ask him out for coffee and tell him that you like him you won't be left wondering whether he likes you or not.  He'll probably tell you.  And if he doesn't, he'll say something like he doesn't want to mess up his relationship.  And then you will know to give up on him and find someone else.  But at the least you should take a chance.|`|8cM4pbNQaa	well that's so easy I've said this before and ill say it again if he acts like a flirt he doesn't like you if he acts like a friend hes not interested if he acts like both snag you're man go getom girl<br>  <br>  xoxo <br>       lola|`|OZvoQw7Qaa	he might but guys always flirt no matter what and then when theyre around their gfs they act like nothing.. but girls do it to like me..lol|`|dbead58eb8474e7277182d6f4b88cc3daa	first you need to find out if he likes you so you dont waste your time|`|rvaXQnunaa	it depends on juet how close u and this girl is|`|wi6E0vnYaa	one clue that he doesn't like you is that he has a gf is it harmless flirting or play around with you flirting big difference diff meanings for each

Chances are, it'll catch up with you in a couple of years.  Eating balanced diet is about all you can do.  You're right don't eat a bunch of junk, but don't be afraid to indulge in foods that have lots of calories.  You might want to try an energy drink or nutritional supplement like Boost or Ensure.  I'm trying to gain weight too and I love Boost.  The most important thing is to take in more calories, not a bunch of fat.  Start paying attention to nutrition labels.

876d1eeabec47ce68ca4350bd5b92c84aa	I dont agree with Itwatkin because all he told you to is something that will please your man, when really what you want is whatever he said done to you. In a way he have a point. The best way to let a man know to take his time with his foreplay and love making is by talking to and promising to show him how you want it. Thats when you can jump in and show him exactly what you talking about by doing everything Itwatkin mentioned. Now you can do these things he mentioned all day long for years but the point is that he still wont have any idea that this is the way you want him to return the favor UNLESS YOU LET HIM KNOW THAT IT IS TOTALLY NECESSARY. You need to let him know that you want him but you need a little bit of time to get excited. Females take 10 min to get to that point, men can get excited in 2 and it is going to be visible. Females are the ones that need to get lubricated and relaxed in order to make sex very pleasuring. Some of us need time for that and a lot of play. Thats when foreplay is very essential. And i think this is exactly what you meant when you said 'romantic in bed'. So my advice...talk to him. Just dont bring it up after sex or during. Just talk to him sometime when both of you home and chilling. Make sure you approach to him by asking him simple questions like "Babe you think our sexual like the best it can be?" or "Hey, can we talk about this.....i always been satisfied with you but i think we can do better" or "I need you to take a lil bit of time, you think you can do it for me?", etc. Good luck and have fun.|`|ZCacLlRoaa	figure out what kind of romance you want and tell him|`|6062e070bf7eb5061df725f054576a0eaa	Just be direct with him and tell him what it is you need in order to be satisfied.

But here's the catch rub on him form herad to toe lick him, grab him, caress him but don;t let him touch you until YOU are ready for it. This will drive him absolutly crazy he will want to touch you so bad and stick to your guns on this if he tries to touch you just push his hands back or tell him you're gonna stop what you are doing if he does touch you.

Love is important but love alone does not help if there is no trust,respect,sharing resposibilities or tolerance with each other. I'm sure that you know how you are like and how your boyfriend is like in character wise. Its not easy with the society pointing fingers as if they know what is best. Most important thing is at the end of the day is both of you. Think wisely and all the best to both of you

4ff9e83df89d09ea265ebd077f2a59b2aa	I have never been through it personally but a close friend of mine had his BF commit suicide while on the phone with him not too long ago. I went to the service and he read a eulogy...and it was a very sad thing. I myself have been through two suicides...one of them being my grandpa...who didnt leave a note or anything. This was over 8 years ago...Yes I am still sad...and yes i feel very angry and cheated and frustrated about  it. Suicide is the ultimate form of selfishness. I hope you make it through ok.|`|5cacd7c3cb34247904392e2c743bbde7aa	i have been through the suicide of a close friend, he had mental health problems.  he feared hurting someone he loved.  so he ended his life.  i thought it was selfish, but now when i think of him it is with sadness not anger.  i respect his decision. <br>  <br>  its been 11 years just last week since he died.|`|K3QSitvVaa	A friend of mine commited suicide just over a year ago as well.  Sadly, he had problems and none of his other "friends" had the wit to see it.  Ironically enough he had won the lottery a few months earlier (a couple of million after taxes).  His past haunted him; namely substance abuse and the fact that he was expelled from college 1 week before graduating as an engineer.  We had drifted apart lately in part because I had moved to another country ( I was too far to even attend the funeral).<br>  <br>  When I spoke to mutual friends of ours they also manifested their regret.  It seems that he had distanced himself from them as well and acquired new ones who were only interested in him for his new found money.  The underlying theme throughout this is "WHAT A WASTE!" I know that money is not everything but a couple of million dollars should be able to buy some degree of hapiness.  He had tried to kill himself once before many years ago but that was before winning the lottery. The truth is that nobody saw it coming.<br>  <br>  Most everybody I knew considered him funny and handsome.  I guess it must of been a perception thing. For some reason he must have believed that his life was not worth living. Perhaps he had a momentary lapse in judgement.  His actions hurt many people including his familly and friends.  Me and a score of other people can't help but wonder if there was anything we could have done to prevent this tragedy.|`|uv2jjMQNaa	The word suicide: simply means intentional killing of oneself.  No one ever go througth suicide for a best friend,  No one with his or her normal senses will want to kill him or herself. Except the person is beyound  comprehension (which it's root is form depression or  fear ). coursed by lust of love one, maltreatment by Parent or guardian. but I want to say many that committed suicide, if only they are giving the chance to come back they will tell you they did the greatest mistake of their life. Dear you have to forgive your friend, and come out of depression, for I once tryed to commit suicide by drinking some poisoned substance, but I was so favoured  by the Lord Almigthy, for he saved me for his purpose. I Tell you, every day I thank God Almigthy for that. So please dont commit suicide, for the Lord, your Family, comminity, Nation and the world at large need's you. For that reason why you where created to worship the Lord, just this moment after reading this you will see how your life will be transformed by Christ Jesus. bless you.

R8Q6GoOfaa	She may be unsure whether or not to date you.  Or, another possibility is that she might be involved with someone else.  She could be considering breaking up with this person and dating you.  That could be why she hasn't committed to a date with you.  Try asking her when she can go out in the next 2 weeks.  If she can't give you a date, then I would suggest that you move on.  Good luck!|`|OSQ14EdSaa	Let her pick the day. She may very well be busy.

That doesn't make sense, but if you pinned me down and asked me if I really wanted to go out at all or am I just not wanting to say no, I would be honest and say what I felt.  Maybe you should just ask if she is interested in going out or is she just busy.  I host 8minuteDating events and hear from men all the time that they get matches, but the women don't ever have time to go out.  We have lots on our plates, especially if there are kids in the picture.  just ask.  then you know.

If she smiles at you alot, touches you, curls her hair, has her leg open to you rather then crossed, and if her pupils are dilated, among many other thing to tell she is at least somewhat attracted to you. Tho she won't necessarily do all those but do watch if she does any of those. It doesn't matter if she find u attractive but rather is attracted to you, women don't care for looks as much as men do, but im not saying women don't care bout looks. They just care more how you present yourself, how you hair is, how you smell, and how you dress. Women are complicated|`|HABC4Ophaa	Hmm, this is definately a tough one as us women are hard to read. <br>  You would probably know she is attracted to you if when you are talking, she only pays attention to you, almost as if there was no one else in the room, she will be interested to learn more about you etc. Some women are not this  upfront so coy smiles can sometimes be a sign, to find out you would need to talk to them.<br>  And the ultimate way to find out is ask them out for a drink sometime, if they say yes then woohoo for you and if they say 'yeah, susan and Alex should come too' then thats probably a sign she's more a friend. Good luck

Ressentez de l'amour pour votre femme comme au premier jour de votre rencontre ? êtes-vous le genre d'homme qui tombe amoureux de la 1ère venue? Tels sont les questions que vous devez à mon humble avis vous poser car il ne sert à rien de revenir à votre femme si vous n'avez aucun sentiment vis à vis d'elle. Arrêtez de la voir au moins pendant deux mois pour donner une chance à votre mariage ce temps de réflexion faites tout ce qui est humainement possible pour reconquérir votre femme,peut-être que la routine est à la base de vos problèmes.Si vous êtes toujours amoureux de cette autre femme ,alors soyez honnête en racontant tout à votre femme,ensemble vous trouverez une solution qui vous conviendrez .Si vous ne pouvez pas lui en parler alors soit vous restez avec votre femme et être malheureux le reste de votre existence (la durée de votre mariage jusqu'au jour où tout pète) si vraiment c'est de l'amour que vous ressentez pour l'autre et non un coup de foudre éphémère,soit vous faites le contraire.Dans les deux cas personne ne sortira indemne de l'histoire.Bonne chance.|`|OYVqPlSkaa	veut tu être polygame ? faire souffrir tes enfants demain ?arrête de jouer avec ta vie et celle de ta fileront un peu plus responsable et plus réalistes .après 2 ans de ton mariage tu parles déjà d'aimer une autre femme.si demain  tu divor?ais avec la mère de ta fille pour épouser cette arriviste ?a serais encore le même comportement si tu voyais une autre fille.quelque soit ce qui se passera dans ta vie ne faire plus jamais d'enfant avec qui que ce soit mais seulement avec ta femme|`|b323a61814d41aa54b614cac4f62fcd4aa	il n'y a que toi pour faire un choix...que veux-tu vraiment? rester avec ta femme et te garder une ma?tresse bien au chaud à c?té?

vz8DONEWaa	You won't want to hear this but when a girl says this often times it is code for she just isn't "in" to you. Think about it....doesn't it make sense for a romantic relationship to have a better chance of making it if the two people are already friends? It means they have taken the time to get to know one another and understand their good side as well as their bad. So I would think that most people would want to become romantically involved with someone they knew pretty well if the attraction is there. But I have a funny feeling that is the key in your case. She does like you as a friend but just isn't attracted to you as a boyfriend. Hey...its not a knock on you...some people like vanilla and some like chocolate and still others like strawberry so don't take it personally. What you have going for you is something you said to describe yourself. You said people thought you were funny and hands down that is the number one thing that women say they are attracted to in a man. So, you have that going for you so now you need to just use your charm along with your wit and go find another girl to focus on that will appreciate all those things and be attracted to you....and I do wish you well.|`|2aef05726285279aabdf8cdf33d05ea1aa	There is nothing you can do, it seems she's not interested.  Now, that being said, if you start dating a new girl this will likely make the popular girl jealous and then she'll want you.|`|ef529ae3ea0167aea784f6dfbf1f3c88aa	Pay her to go out with you.|`|klaO9kxoaa	So what i can guess is your in the friend zone, that does suck. But you could try getting her jealous, when your with her talk to other girls, make them laugh and have fun. If you see signs that she is jealous then you can make a move, ask her to coffee of something then work your way up.<br>  <br>  Also if your spending alot of time with her then cut it in half or more, get her to miss you then she'll want to spend more time with you later. Mainly one of the reasons she doesn't want you <br>  is cause your too available, women want a challenge.|`|AA12016994	Respect her wishes.  She is being polite and may not even be interested in dating any one yet.  The more you show yourself gentle, loyal and more of a friend the better of your relationships are in life.

AA11119577	My boyfriend is going through a tough time too.  I made him a cd with songs of encouragement, and he liked that.

That you love him, will always love him, and will always be there for him. Actions speak louder than words so more than likely, he already knows that you love him and are here for him!

It sounds like she likes the attention you give her, but maybe she isn't very much into you.  You should kind of back off and give her a taste of what it is like without you giving her so much attention, I bet she will totally be chasing after you. Go out there and meet other people too. You met her a few times and are already very attached to her. Spend time meeting other people and doing other things. Don't focus all you love and attention on someone who does not fully appreciate it and give it back to you.

I'd say he's not worth it either if that's all I saw of him.<br>  <br>  Parents are predisposed to look at a potential boyfriend or girlfriend negatively. They want to carefully scrutinize and critique the person who has their beloved child's heart. You have to show your guy for the good qualities he has. Encourage him to sit down with your parents and talk to them so that they can get to know each other. Also, follow their wishes about how you interact with the boy. If they don't want you seeing him, DON'T SEE HIM. Not even behind their backs. If you and your boyfriend show your parents you can be trusted to follow their instructions, they may ease up. Give them time.  Talk to them about how you feel and be willing to listen to them.<br>  <br>  If your guy is worthwhile, they'll know it soon.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Hate to tell you this, but parents are usually right about the boyfriend and kicking him to the curb.

Tell yourself something different. When you are older you will appreciate a man who has a sense of right and wrong, and who stands up for people who he believes need standing up for. Its part of having some integrity. Look at Charlie's qualities as a person - honesty, a sense of right and right, and whatever you value in a person, and not at specific instances in which Charlie said something that you didn't agree with or that made you feel jealous. I love it when my husband stands up for women, it means he knows that as a man and a human being he should stand up for things he believes in. <br>  And yes, if he never really like Mel, then he would probably take any opportunity he got to argue with her passionately about anything! I think you are worried about nothing. And the flirting... well, flirting can be fun and it does not mean anything when the person doing it does not mean anything by it. I flirt with men right in front of my husband and he rolls his eyes and makes fun of me and he flirts with women in front of me and I make fun of him - either telling him he'd never get them or they'd never be better than me anyway. It doesnt have to mean anything.
GVOENpmzaa	Forget that kid!  Anyone who will say crude things like the f-bomb to you isn't worth being around -- even if he DOES apologize or whatever.  But that's bull, that's for sure.  Don't put up with it.  It just sounds like he needs someone, and you're the lucky somebody.  He sees you as someone who will just conveniently be there whenever is good for him.<br>  <br>  Don't call him.  Or if you do, call him to tell HIM to f- off.  Lay down the law, sister!|`|O1jBM3jgaa	If I were you, I would tell him to get lost and change my phone number.  You don't need that kind of sh-t in your life and what your feeling is not love anymore, its only because he was your first,  it will take time to get over him but you have to make the first move to do so and your doing now by asking for help on how to.  Your tired,  let go of him.  The next time he comes around, threaten the cops on him, you don't have to it though, just tell him that.  I really hope everything works out for you.|`|kXaLbjNKaa	Do you really love him?  Go ahead and go and try to get him to tell you where this is going.

We broke up 2 mths ago. In the first week of the breakup, he seemed to have intentions of patching up but he changed his mind again. I said goodbye to him but things suddenly got worse and we started to hurl insults at each other, blaming each other etc. Sometimes I sense that he still has feelings for me but he is somehow holding it back. Yah...I got sick and tired of his antics and trying to hold me back each time when I wanted to give up. Eventually, things cooled down and we stopped contact with each other. <br>  <br>  I can really understand how you feel!!! There's some part of me which wants him to ask me out again and yet some part of me wants a closure and a end to all of these. Right now, I don't bother much about this broken relationship anymore. I'm just planning my own stuff, keeping myself busy and when I feel lonely or when I think about him, I'll talk to my friends instead or write in my diary. It helps and keeps me from contacting him. <br>  <br>  I hope my advice helped you! You can email me if you want to : Grace_Teo_4_Ever@yahoo.com|`|AA12254888	it sounds like it′s too soon for both of you to be friends again... i′m curious about why he treated you like that when you called him maybe he heard that you were dating someone else or some gossip about you reached him? you shoulw ask him about that. my advice will be not to call him, he is obviously not ready to be friends with you.|`|SLO8pbsDaa	quit taking him back, tell him its friends or nuthin, but i am sure you will get to the point that you have to just totally cut him off, and it will be a sad thing if you really are good friends, cus a good friend is hard to come by|`|qpCZrrzhaa	First can I just say, punctuation is your friend!!!! About your problem, it seems like he still has feelings for you but can't figure out what to do about it. Maybe he still wants you in his life, but it's hard for him to be just friends with you??

I've become so from practice  (yes, dating takes practice)<br>  <br>  Any time you want to be with someone, it's an emotional risk, so just open a can of courage.<br>  <br>  A good way is to invite him to do something simple, like get coffee, meet for lunch, study together--anything to let him know you want to spend time with him.<br>  <br>   If you spend time with him, you should be able to tell how he feels and it gives him a chance to get to know you.|`|AA10500168	Oh wow. Ok the way I told my last crush that i liked him was in a message on myspace.  Not the smartest way.  I didn't even care if he liked me back. One of my best friends said that he did and she was good in predicting if guys did or didnt like someone.  So I studied his every move when ever I saw him.  And I kinda noticed that he liked me too.  [But i did that after i told him. Boy was that a mistake] And he also was giving me signals.  Now he's in High School, and he never asked me out.  Bad story to tell you but ya.<br>  So on a new crush [im not really interested in any one right now, not that i know of atleast] i would study him, his past girl friends or/and if he never had any friends.  See who he hangs out with, see if he notices me.  Then if he notices me then i would see if he looks at me differently then his friends.  If he does then it is a good thing :D so when im pretty sure that he likes me, then i would tell him.  I tell him in person this time. :D<br>  Hope i helped :D|`|b7c68ce2ddcd1cb44cf60b322144a942aa	Just ask him worst case is he says he doesnt and you can stop wasting you time. and if he does then you are where youi want to be|`|db37c7b0a8d5e59d32814368c9c05173aa	just flirt with him alot and he will tell you if he likes you because guys definitely arent shy but if you dont want to wait you should tell people you like him and when it gets back to him you should see what he says are what someone close to him says he says|`|klQ2Xk9Maa	ASK HIM OUT or don't worry about it!

Sometimes (actually a lot of times) a guy that might not seem so attractive at first becomes MUCH more attractive when you get to know his personality and it makes you wonder why you didn't think he was hot in the first place. <br>  <br>  On the flip side hot-at-first-glance guys can become significantly less attractive if they are jerks when you get to know them.<br>  <br>  One or two dates should give you some time to get to know him better but shouldn't set him up for heartbreak should you decide you still aren't interested in him that way.|`|478ff119626655e0ea5ed17eb4c02b08aa	Over time you may find you like him alot, once you get to know him.|`|8iiQ2GFSaa	don't feel obligated to go, we hate that. mabye go out wiht him once get to know him better, then you can go from there.|`|DfwTglA7aa	i think u should try to go out with him to know what his like rather then deciding to break his heart now give him a chance and yourself a chance to know each other well first maybe u would like him and fall in love with him at the end of the day loves every where u just had to find it yourself|`|FWakrN61aa	i would wait a little and see if your feelings change|`|NaoasR5caa	Yes , give the little buck-a-roo a chance.

Then it is pity, and most guys rather not date you at all, than have you date them out of pity. Now if you are being more positive about it, then date the guy, see if you dont come to like him more and something come of it. It is all a matter of mind set really. Don't do it out of pity, do it out of hope for a better relationship with the guy.|`|W5Crnh8Waa	Well it depends on how much you like the guy in question. but in my opinion yes you should. it gives you a chance to get to know each other better|`|dceaf7c862b73777c192a5852d818b47aa	okay you said you like him, just go out with him.

This is hardly a commitment to a relationship and sometimes I think people would do well in dating to remember this difference.  Do something where you too can interact and you can judge the extent to how much you are interested in him.<br>  <br>  I've read somewhere, and my female friends seem to agree with me, that most women make up their minds in the first five minutes of meeting a guy on whether he is a potential lover or a potential friend.  This is even more interesting when I think of how many women think it's better to be friends first.  In these cases, it seems these women only really decide that they like a guy when they have a chance to get to know him a little better.|`|AA11353174	...no I wouldn't go out with him...that would be leading him on...|`|qorQsucFaa	umm give me a try....she might be surprised...if it works out great...if not at least you know both of you gave it a shot|`|uB7Z6PW3aa	depends on who is paying

AA10588653	I don't think acting like them would do anything - they sound pretty dense to get the subtly of it. <br>  <br>  I had a friend like that in high school. But I also constantly heard "I'm CUTE. I'm a PRINCESS!" ... Annoyed the hell out of me. So much that I decided that it wasn't worth it. I started hanging out more with people who DIDN'T make me want to gouge my eyes out. She still said it, but not having to pretend like her blabbering was legit made it much easier to stand. <br>  <br>  I suggest that. Find those friends that don't make you cringe every time they give you a call. Even the friends you're not close with - work on that, make them close friends. <br>  <br>  Honestly, you may like your two friends and want them to remain in your life, but when being friends becomes a hassle and not a relief, something is wrong. I'm not saying to kick them out of your life, I'm just saying that you've grown up and it's time for you to move on. Maybe someday your friends will catch up with you.|`|rmUHfwxNaa	Yea i'd have the same reaction. I say find a new hobby. I'm not saying ditch them, but get something better to do. They seem annoying|`|AA12076287	Maybe you should start acting like them and see how they like it...saying that everyone likes you and that you are inlove with 5 different men and give them a taste of their own medicine to see how they will react to all the drama
ed9c52fcc32bc21499c8007eec999f5faa	I haven’t seen the news recently, just the initial reports. <br>  <br>   It is awful that the world is not a completely safe place for our children.  But are there really parents who don’t know this?  You do NOT leave your 4-year-old ALONE in a hotel room while you go out to dinner.  And not just because of potentional kidnappers, but for numerous other reasons.<br>  <br>  What I find the most amazing is that this ONE case has gotten so much attention.  There are thousands of children that go missing every single day all over the world, and they don’t get this kind of attention, nor do they have people donating huge amounts of money for their return (it would be great if they did).  So, what was so special about this one case?<br>  <br>  I hope they find her soon and she’s okay.  And I hope other parents learn a lesson from this.|`|AA11405570	I am a Australian mum of two kids & we have seen the story about Madeleine on our nightly news.

Il y a la famille qui demande sans arret "quand est ce que tu nous présentes ta fiancée" et les amis en couple qui ont peur que tu deviennes une tentation pour leur conjoint... <br>  La société a encore des difficultés à accepter que certains n'obéissent pas au schéma "maison, enfants et chien (la cerise sur le gateau ! )"|`|h0DPeqjHaa	non!|`|B0i1P4eSaa	oui et non ! <br>  oui car nous vivons ds des scocietes qui n'admettent pas que quelqu'un soit seul car incontrolable ,et le but c'est de marier les gens , les endettes et leurs faire fairedes gosses!!<br>  non car c'est la vie qu'il ou elle a choisi sachant les avantages et les inconvenients!|`|UYprqICVaa	Je ne vois pas pourquoi!!!!!!!|`|YfJS0DUUaa	La plupart des héros sont de grand solitaires qui ont une forte personnalité du fait même qu'ils se la sont forgés eux mêmes et n'ont pas besoin des autres pour vivre ce qui leur confère une grande indépendance associée d'une grande dignité.<br>  <br>  Cependant je pense que ce n'est pas très rassurant pour l'entourage car le solitaire est un électron libre qui peut faire peur aux conformismes en tous genre. Les Autres souhaitent intégrer l'individu afin d'avoir un moyen de contr?le sur lui afin de l'intégrer à la norme de la société à laquelle ils appartiennent (famille, groupe politique, bande, religion...).<br>  <br>  Ce qui fait peur c'est l'effet loupe des médias que ce soit le cas des fictions ou des actualités qui mettent souvent l'accent sur le c?té solitaire des criminels.<br>  <br>  Vivre seul n'est pas problématique en soi, cependant ne pas avoir de contacts sociaux doit être considéré comme anormal car nous avons tous un instinct grégaire qui nous pousse à communiquer et entrer en relation avec nos semblables.<br>  Communiquer, échanger permet de relativiser et de se faire une opinion.<br>  <br>  L'important dans la solitude c'est qu'elle résulte d'un choix et de l'assumer.<br>  La solitude qui résulte de la déception peut para?tre comme un échec cuisant que le solitaire en question n'aurait pas réussit à surmonter et par là le catégorise comme un battu plut?t que comme un battant...<br>  <br>  La solitude en fin de compte comporte ses joies et ses peines qui sont inhérentes à la vie de tous les jours... Mais il faut savoir que les gens qui ont des relations sociales se sentent plus fort pour affronter la vie, sont jugés comme plus sympathiques, et plus sociables.<br>  Des études ont prouvées que la vie de couple prolongerait la durée de vie... cependant il n'est pas rare que lorsque l'un des deux décède, l'autre se laisse mourir à son tour.<br>  <br>  Bref, la solitude interpelle car nous ne sommes théoriquement pas programmés génétiquement pour la vivre. Elle peut être la cause de souffrance ou de frustrations.<br>  <br>  Cependant la solitude est parfois nécessaire et n'est qu'une étape de la vie : mieux se conna?tre, se ressourcer, méditer.<br>  <br>  Si la solitude est trop pesante on peut apprendre à vivre en société et avoir des relations sociales satisfaisante par le biais de thérapie cognitive qui va se focaliser sur le développement d'habiletés sociales chez l'individu... parfois un nombre restreint de séances suffisent à adopter de nouveaux comportements.<br>  <br>  Sur ce à bon entendeurs salut & I'm a poor lomesone cowboy!!!|`|dC7dYPFTaa	ben non pourquoi<br>  y'en a de plus en plus....|`|xZao0Zqraa	non au contraire  ils envies sa liberte <br>  bisou|`|ovGymGo7aa	non,<br>  pas du tout<br>  <br>  <br>  si ?a lui fait plaisir, et il a bien raison

seWZxCFSaa	Bonsoir!<br>  La tendresse est selon moi, une des expressions de la bonté.<br>  C'est manifester beaucoup de bienveillance mais avec une grande délicatesse, une grande douceur, c'est comme envelopper l'autre dans un écrin d'amour ou il se sente bien au chaud sans pour autant l'étouffer bien au contraire.|`|1c39e08f96d9f0d3c09935741b6ac369aa	Différente de l'amour et du désir, se rapprochant de l'affection, la tendresse est une qualité de l'attention qui s'offre, se propose, sans jamais contraindre, qui peut donc se mettre en réserve, en attente, sans se refermer, sans se bloquer à jamais. La tendresse se vit, s'éprouve, permet de recevoir et de donner. C'est une sensation fragile, une émotion imprévisible, quelque chose de secret et fugace faisant participer l'ensemble des sens. Elle transparait par les gestes, le toucher, la douceur, la délicatesse, l'attention, le regard, la voix, le respect. La tendresse permet de créer une relation d'affection.|`|1d5291075dab590fc63153a771bc2b10aa	un des plus beaux mot au monde <br>  bise|`|77e389f896ad076850e76602bd90e6feaa	une chanson de daniel guichard ? goulp!|`|wWoyq0IOaa	bonsoir Jacati<br>  c'est ouvrir les bras à ceux qu'on aime|`|5c303d6384583dfcb41f0d43fb2e83aaaa	une caresse sur le visage pendant un baiser avec celui que j'aime|`|8aGxky6daa	un proverbe dit que la tendresse fait fondre le marbre par contre la continuite de quelque chose fait creuser le marbre|`|Gooilyldaa	le respect de l'autre.|`|JW2TXRYxaa	Le geste délicat du partage,  le souffle de l'amour....|`|QK0ZjUheaa	Tendresse : Donner de soi, de la douceur dans un geste, un mot ou une attitude à la personne qui nous tient à coeur, celle à qui l'on donne un amour profond<br>  <br>  @h j'aime bien la définition de "skieur fou" ...|`|XXVUh6Egaa	Pour moi la tendresse représente l'emphatie. <br>  <br>  Quelqu'un qui a la capacité de ressentir ce que tu ressent et est capable de te supporter émotivement.<br>  <br>  Une fois cette tendresse/emphatie exprimée, cela a automatiquement un effet positif sur l'état mental d'une personne qui ne se sentait pas bien par exemple.<br>  <br>  Ah oui, ma deuxième définition de la tendresse est quand un homme devient inhabile devant une femme dont il a à l'oeil. <br>  <br>  Je trouve cela amusant à observer et beau à voir.

0cfa553aecb57c33710d398bac40aa80aa	I am a guy, so i can relate to what you're saying. The only reason a guy would push you away is if you were coming on too strong such as, talking about marraige, or kids too soon. If you talk down to him that will make him push you away as well. I have been through this many times and know the reasons for this kind of behavior. It doesn't matter if you're "good looking". Guys are not intimidated by women, some are just shy is all, but if you act like you;'re better than him then that will do it.|`|8kN9F0Zjaa	maybe you can consider the fact that most men, unlike women, would not make women as their world... most men would continue on their busy lives even if they really love the girl they are dating... we, women usually make the man we love as our world, i mean you want spend most of your time with him..but he wont do the same because they have  other interests, but it doesn't mean he is pushing you away.<br>  <br>  maybe you can be more patient in understanding them...and next time you dated with a guy...told you that he loves you...but you feel being pushed away again, you ask them about it so you can understand if its really pushing away...or its just how they live...|`|1BJKxu09aa	It's because we don't want to get too close to someone.

It's better to be alone than with the wrong man.<br>  <br>  Forget worrying if you are "intimidating in any way."  Be the best person you can be and don't try to be someone you aren't.<br>  <br>  And yes, good-looking, good job and self confidence are intimidating to many men because they want to feel needed.  Just make sure that you communicate an area of need so they know if they can fill it and then let them go if they don't.<br>  <br>  They get mad when you leave because they feel it as a personal failure that they cannot meet your needs.|`|0ox8VKwKaa	I think its a maturity issue basically.The macho tough guy has a hard time with his sensitivity and intimacy. In fact they are clueless. Its usually later for men that they start to change how they connect and relate to woman. I think a lot of women like older men for that reason.|`|rHSh8DDAaa	It is easy for a man to be intimidated by a woman, for whatever reason, and not be able to express himself. This isn't the whole answer of course, but it is a factor to think about...are you intimidating in any way?|`|Fs4fAwfwaa	Insecurity!?!<br>  <br>  They...well we′re afraid of looking weak.<br>  <br>  But if the girl is worth that we′ll drop our guard for her.<br>  <br>  Don′t disappoint us though!! ;-)<br>  <br>  Be good!<br>  Caleb|`|k2hPH2rgaa	they are insecure and fearful. otherwise, they would not get angry when u leave. they just dont know what they want for sure.... :-)

"Life is so short - enjoy it to the max"<br>  <br>  A|`|uz0n8fRIaa	Yup, he's into you.

Ask him what's he doing for lunch or if he'll want to grab a cup of coffee at break or sometime. Mini dates first so less pressure. Good luck! =)

(  Reconna?tre qu'on ne peut pas suffire - soi seul - pour sauver ce mec. Peut-être...  Peut-être.)<br>  C'est pour ?a que je dis: méfiance. Mais c'est bien de t'approcher pour voir et prendre la mesure de la tache. Seulement, à la moindre hésitation, à la moindre lassitude, n'hésite pas à prendre conseil auprès de gens compétents. Peut-être des adultes qui connaissent déjà bien ce jeune. Ca te permettra de mieux voir si tu peux continuer ou reconna?tre que tu ne suffiras pas pour le tirer d'affaire.<br>  Joyeux courage à toi en tous cas.<br>  C'est déjà beau de ne pas te détourner à la première difficulté . Ton altruisme t'honore.

cpTzAWyCaa	Hola<br>  <br>  espero que te sirva lo que te voy a decir:<br>  primeramente para salir de la depresión, necesitas perdonar a tu esposo, como, en tu corazon, si tu decides perdonar a quien te ofende sea quien sea tu corazon sera sanado, no es cosa de humillarte o hacer que nada paso ?No!, es simplemente que para que seas feliz no necesitas que el te quiera, necesitas quererte tu primero, y para que eso pase necisitas recibir el amor de primera mano, como?<br>  de quien nos ama mucho mas que nadie mas que nosotras mismas.    Dios y lo que necesitas primeramente es<br>  recibir a Jesucristo en tu corazon.<br>  <br>  Dios te ama tanto que dio la provision para que tu seas feliz, una vez que lo recibes, cambia toda tu situación, hasta tu marido.<br>  <br>  El día que tu seas feliz, la gente que esta a tu alrededor, va arecibir de ti amor, y se va a hacercar a ti y te va a corresponder.<br>  <br>  si tu quieres recibir a Jesucristo en tu corazon solo tienes que decirselo el te escucha y te conoce porque Dios es omnipresente, omnisciente y ominipotente<br>  <br>  que quiere decir que esta en todo lugar, sabe todo y puede todo.<br>  <br>  permite que el amor de Dios entre en tu vida primeramente.<br>  <br>  si de algo te sirve, yo sali de una situación como la tuya o peor aun. se destruyo todo mi matrimonio por adulterio, alcoholismo y deudas muchas deudas.<br>  <br>  y hoy puedo decirte que Dios restauro mi matrimonio, mi esposo ya no toma, ya no sale de parranda, solo sale conmigo, y estamos empezando a tener una nueva relacion como pareja. yo decidi primeramente recibir el amor de Dios.<br>  <br>  espero ayudarte con mis palabras. no estas sola, no devaluada, tu vales mucho porque alguien pago el precio y ese fue Jesucristo en la Cruz imaginate solo Dios podia pagar tanto por nosotras porque? porque nos ama.|`|3gruPX9Eaa	la verdad no se que decirte, por coraje hacia él, como

ultimos anos que te quedan los puedes pasar feliz, con otra persona que te merezca o sola, y tranquila, debes ir a un sicologo, aumentar autoestima, divorciarte, demandarlo, y luego salir a pasear, disfrutar conocer gente nueva, ser feliz, lo que no has hecho, o no has sabido que existe, te hablo duro porque siento coraje cada vez que oigo de un tipo abusando de una mujer y que este por ahi

8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	Distance yourself as completely as possible and give yourself time. When you "keep busy," make sure you're socializing with other people and putting yourself in contact to meet new ones.  Clubs, Internet, listening to music (very useful during these times), friends, families, animals.  By being in contact with other people you'll realize there are other guys out there, though you may not notice them right away.  You will when you're ready ;)|`|90963f59f493839bcab93f578ad1e747aa	get into your own life and go out with your friends... stay busy with crafts, hobbies. write a list of why you broke up and burn it. pray that god brings you someone worthy of you.<br>  read books that let you escape to a different place...<br>  listen to music. go for walks.|`|v7Kqx9W7aa	Time can do that. It depends on how long you dated. You will come to a point where everything doesn't make you think of him. Believe me I have been there and I know. At first you can't sleep at night for thinking about him. Then you're thinking about him all day. Then several times a day he comes to your mind. Then just a few times a day. Then all of sudden you realize you hardly think of him at all. I have found that sometimes falling for someone else brings you out of this a lot faster.|`|8wvxHyiLaa	well you have to find something that is obviously more important than him. Stay busy. Try God. Siblings activities, like sports events. hang with your friends. go shoping with your parents. <br>  <br>  you will still think about him in between moments and get sad, but eventually you will learn to live without him the way you did before you even knew him.<br>  AND you have to be angry enough not to care his feelings and put yourself first.<br>  <br>  I had this problem once before and I was depressed. I went to church to realize what things are really important. you spend hours thinking about someone who does you wrong, instead of the one who gave his life for you. why hurt GOD everyday?

c8036e2be9f61cc961a75857796ccb2faa	To be blunt, no. If you were deeply in love and leave a relationship, it will hurt for a given period of time, sometimes a life time.

SAME WILL GO FOR THE OTHER PERSON SHE/HE WILL NOT STAY AND WAIT FOR YOU, THAT OTHER PERSON ALSO HAS HER/HIS LIFE TO LIVE.

This is part of the very definition of love and human nature.  However, one can appear to leave it instantly depending on the emotions one is experiencing.

Could she stay with you until she got on her feet? Its not just her husbands problem, its her problem too... they are married and she continues to let him do that to her. Its not right and nobody deserves to be treated that way... the next thing you know she'll be appearing on that show Snapped... and its not safe when someone reaches that point.

It's usually a self-esteem issue. She has little self-esteem and thinks that she will not find it anywhere else. Even through the abuse, she sees that he still accepts her and she loves that. This has little to do with him. It's all about her. <br>  She has as much problem as him for she takes the abuse willingly. This is not love. It is just mutual destruction. For some people, women especially, they see the abuse as a form of love. Look deep, it usually goes back to family of origin issues and rests with the father. <br>  This is the key to the repair.|`|HL8PEDFLaa	No, if she really valued herself and maintaining a healthy life she wouldn't be with him. Many women feel that they have no other place to go, but what they don't realize is that there are a lot of organizations out there dedicated to helping women leave their abusive situations. Tell her she needs to do some research because it sounds to me she hasn't put a lot of thought into leaving him.|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Amber, it is obvious you are a very caring person and want to help your friend.

I have never been in a relationship like the one you described. She can get help from a woman's shelter and other places. Maybe being her friend you could put her up for awhile and help her.

Women in these sorts of relationships become very good liars, they cover and cover and cover up their husband's despicable behavior.  No one can be in an abusive relationship and be happy, the two just do not go together.  She's right about one thing though her husband or so called does have the problem, he will suffer from low self esteem, will use her acceptance of the situation as his power base to feel better about himself.  Trust me she does not love this man anymore, its her fear of the unknown that keeps her there.  As a good friend are you not able to offer her a place to stay until she got back on her feet as a good friend of mine did for me, it was what saved me and my three children in the end,  we now share a wonderful life, i found a good job, bought a house of my own and would never consider ever being in such a position again with a man like that.  All it took was guts, determination and the need to want better for myself and my children and the graciousness of a true friend to open her home to me for 6 weeks.  This man will continue to do this to your friend for as long as she will let him, he'll abuse her until she is just a shell of her former self, scary but that's in the end the reality of the situation that she lets herself stay in|`|nGkCYhfiaa	WOW! He has that much control over her, to the point that she has convinced herself she is happy. You're thoughts are completely valid. Someone needs to vigorously shake your friend. I hope they don't have any children. Does she have any family? Maybe if you offered her a place to stay until she gets on her own two feet, she might see that she deserves better and that there is help out there.|`|e2cb77e61d5d9c19992a2afc9272e221aa	I think you answered your own question here.  If I was your friend, I would giver her husband a choice.  If you continue to treat me like this, I leave.  As you get older, your self-esteem goes down, trust me!  No one should go through this in a marriage!  Either seek counseling together if she cares for him or leave.  Good luck!  I think it's great you care about your friend like you do!|`|vb6nB7ANaa	Of course she cant be happy she probably just afraid to leave and afraid of what life will be like alone for awhile.She shouldn't take that she needs to get out its never to late.|`|i0zqlI2Aaa	it could be possible.<br>  in some type of sick way.<br>  but im sure ur friend isn`t that type of person. because it doesn`t sound like it.<br>  but honestly if she was as strong as she claims she is, she would have the courage to leave him. and go through whatever she had to to start over no matter how hard it was.<br>  just like u said.<br>  i think she is just scared and convincing herself to live with her lifestyle she has.<br>  but im sure deep down in side she wants out.<br>  she is just scared of change.<br>  and sometimes thats something to be scared of.<br>  just pay attention closely.<br>  she might be crying out for help.
45yA4JBZaa	Cet air a été faussement attribué à Lulli par Cappelle sans aucune preuve.

le2BsaKnaa	When Janet is talking mean about Jane to you, nicely tell remind her that you are still friends with Jane and that you don't want her to talk bad about her. You can't stop Janet from talking mean about Jane, but you don't have to listen to it. If she still talks about it, try and get onto a different subject or something. Talk about just about anything other than Jane. If she catches on and still talks mean, then you need to keep reminding her and telling her that you will NOT talk mean about Jane. If it comes down to it and Janet wants you to pick between her and Jane, do not pick. Tell her that you want to be friends with both of them, so if she wants to stop being your friend that's her problem. Then, if she does do that, then I would think that she was never really your friend, but that might not be true. She might not have been the closest friend though. Just make sure that you stand up for Jane, weather she is around or not.|`|pABXrYNqaa	oh yeah......it's on!

Anzi ti dirò....esistono locali molto più confortevoli e tranquilli dove puoi tranquillamente iniziare una buona conoscenza|`|oHhEcBgjaa	No, può capitare dappertutto, sull'autobus, tramite altri amici ecc.ecc.<br>  Naturalmente però la discoteca è un lugo particolare, luci quasi inesistenti, ti puoi avvicinare ad una ragazza e puoi ballarci insieme, alcune volte bevi un pò quindi sei più estroverso e fai quel passo in più che non faresti da sobrio, ma spesso quando capita è solo per una breve storia se non solo per quella notte.

Si l'on ne veut pas se laisser "emprisonner" par une maladie, il faut maintenir, le mieux qu'on peut, avec l'énergie qui reste, des activités agréables, promenades dans des endroits aimés, contacts avec des gens, tout dépend de la personnalité. Ce maintien d'une certaine activité doit être légère, c'est à dire ne pas utiliser 100  % de l'énergie d'une journée, mais peut-être un 30-40%. Pour ne pas être totalement à bout après l'activité = ne plus avoir envie de refaire / retenter une activité similaire.<br>  <br>  Parfois plus aucune activité n'est réellement possible, hormis peut-être de parler, voire écrire. Là, d'avoir une croyance, religion ou spiritualité, ou philosophie, méditation, etc.. peut apporter énormément. (Et l'imagination !!!!!! Vivre de rêves. Tu me conna?s un peu, je crois que tu sais ce que j'entends par là.) <br>  1) permet de mieux accepter une "malchance".<br>  2) la souffrance, l'isolement sont d'une terrible efficacité pour aller dans le sens de la sagesse. Cette sagesse on peut ensuite la tranmettre.  Invalide du corps, mais infiniment utile pour le monde en tant que "sage", cela permet de compenser une frustration ("à mon age on ne devrait pas être invalide) par un plaisir ("à mon age, presque personne n'a une "sagesse" comme moi). <br>  Certains se sentent utiles, valorisés parque que a 60 ams ils ont par exemple au boulot une énergie - vitalité qui leur permet d'être bien meilleurs que des jeunes de p.ex. 25-30).  D'autres peuvent se sentir utiles, valorisé car ils ont 30 ans de sagesse d'avance sur des gens du même age. <br>  Il n'est plus de mode d'écouter les sages grand-mères de 80 ans, qui "radotent". Une personne bien plus jeune se confiera, écoutera, demandera infiniment plus facilement un avis d'une personne physiquement invalide, mais mentalement bien lucide, et ayant bien moins de 90ans. <br>  <br>  Voilà quelques avis et conseils. Je suis toujours disposé à donner un avis plus précis hors YQ/R. Je serai toujours là pour te donner un avis ou parce que moi-même, je suis, pour le moins j'essaye d'être humain avec toute personne, tout animal.   Bonne chance !!

Learned to lock the door after that..|`|AYfJWQuTaa	It happens to most people at some time or other, you handled it well anyway!<br>  Find a way to put something against the door that will give you a bit of warning or lock it!|`|y1Fihj3Maa	Yes, our youngest daughter walked into our room early one morning, found us in a compromising position, left the room and ran back to hers.  She was 18 at the time.  <br>  <br>  When we talked about it, she said she was glad to see that we still enjoyed each other in that way, but she could have done without the visual.  LOL.|`|kNAcutL0aa	last year, when our daughter is in her early 3...she is sleeping beside us and been woke up because of our movement, she asked why her dad is in my top...<br>  <br>  i did not say anything, my hubby said, just go to sleep baby, okay!|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Yes,<br>  <br>  This is very embarrassing.

I think it happens to everyone.  First your 7 year old will forget this.  Second you end up having sex late at night or shortly after the kids go to bed.  I had two kids and they would walk in during sex i ended up getting off like normal and started telling the kids when the door is shut mom and dad are not up that they should go play a game or something.  It took a couple of times to remind them but they did.  The other thing I would do is do a treasure hunt game so when they got up, they both would do a treasure hunt separately and at the end they both would get a treat.|`|nGkCYhfiaa	My son is still a baby, but I completely understand how you feel.

You'll have even more things to talk about (kids, jobs, spouses, etc.)  and as long as you have a strong bond, absence really does make the heart grow fonder.  There are some things you'll only want to talk to your siblings about.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Everyone's different.  All I can suggest is common sense- communicate regularly, and meet up at least a few times a year as circumstances allow.|`|GQJbOblQaa	Normally, the sweetness does not remain the same, particularly after marriage as everyone will have their own family to look after and they get busy with their career and personal life.  <br>  <br>  However, the warmth and love between brothers/sisters must not be allowed to die.  One must make sincere efforts to maintain contacts and this is possible by:<br>  <br>  1.  Wishing each other and other family members on birthdays, marriage days, festivals, New Year etc.<br>  <br>  2.  Never forget to invite them on any occasions for lunch or dinner.<br>  <br>  3.  Whenever you visit them, do not forget to carry a small gift of the item they loved in childhood.  <br>  <br>  4.  Appreciate and say good words about your brother/sister and their family members whenever you visit them.  Do not become a critic, even well intentioned.  <br>  <br>  5.  Never give unsolicited advices and never forget to congratulate each other on their achievements.|`|67115b1163cc8b9c69bf180fdf940ed7aa	Every Family is different actually, it depends on how they grew up as well..<br>  <br>  I know 2 large families<br>  **Family A- the siblings are all married over their 30 all of them are very friendly to each other,very caring they visit each other all the time.. The cousins are all friends some best friends..<br>  they invite each other for dinner and all that. The Family is basically very Loving and caring about one another.<br>  <br>  **Family B- The Siblings are all married also over their 30 as well..<br>  They do talk, but no love no care no nothing.<br>  when they have issues to do with money they get all caring and nice, so basically they use each other..they never bother to visit each other.<br>  They don't let their children play with their cousins and jealousy is a great role in their family.<br>  <br>  <br>  So it just depends on how the siblings grew up i think..<br>  i'm not really sure what gets to separate a family from loving each other, but i think just keeping in touch with each other, trusting each other, and loving and caring for each other will all help the family stay As they were..|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	yes still remains ' just keep on mind the good old days|`|POsgMHhLaa	don't interfere if not asked<br>  respect each others  privacy
866a46e62ddf9c26732be873ef09e2f0aa	Nel caso del ragazzo dovrebbe avvenire la rottura del frenulo ma nessuno in genere si psinge tanto in là. In quanto alle donne perdere la verginità con un aggeggio fa male più che perderla col parner, comunque che la verginità si perda con equitazione, ginnastica ecc. è una balla, al massimo si può perdere con una spaccata che però ti fa malissimo e resti senza fiato. Se si rompe l'imene poi esce sangue, chi di voi ha mai perso sangue in casi del genere? Ve ne sareste accorte. E' una voce nata per coprire gli abusi fatti sulle bambine che esse stesse non ricordano, quando una ragazza abusata comincia a ricordare le chiedo se ha perduto sangue al primo rapporto e in genere la risposta è no, pensavano fosse accaduto facendo ginnastica, ma nessuna ricorda un fatto in cui sia uscito del sangue.|`|7733c4c608f8030b21dd1c6e1d384fa0aa	Intanto non hai specificato il sesso. La perdita della verginità intesa come la intendono tutti è riferita alle ragazze, che la perdono , e non sempre , al primo rapporto sessuale.

YPHExEJ0aa	Speaking from experience and from i have seen with others, long distance relationships dont work. BUT, if it were possible both would have to be willing to make big changes in their lives if they wanted it to work out. Also, one of the 2 people will eventually have to move to where the other is living at for it to last. But you must keep in mind both of you guys have to keep realistic goals of what you both want with each other. Not one person alone should carry the torch if you know what i mean.

8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	It's possible, but not enough information.  The signs are pretty ambiguous.     He does sound like a shy guy, so if you want to find out, you may have to intiate a conversation.  Start with something small, like homework and class and see how he reacts.    He may be having trouble finding the courage.|`|XCEkqfJEaa	Oh so when someone asks if they need help carrying a chair down the stairs it means "i love you"?

It would be cute to like knock on his window in the middle of the night and say that you just happened to be in the neighborhood walking by.  Ask what he's doing and stuff.  If he turns and smiles at you when you walk past it might stand to reason he thinks you're hot too, so maybe you intimidate him as much as he does you.|`|Shd9juvzaa	Wow is all I can say. First off, you can talk to guys as you refer to "ugly" "average" and so forth. But you can't talk to this guy who is way hot. The truth is, he's a person just like you. just because he's hot doesn't mean he's the most impossible person to talk to or get. You're letting it get to you and you shouldn't. Okay, so he has  a girlfriend but that doesn't mean you guys can be friends. Instead of just passing by his house and waiting for him to do or say something, be the bigger person, go and talk to him. Nothing too fancy but just approach him when he's done practicing his "sport" and say that you are interested in learning whatever he's playing. It will defintely make you get closer to him and a definite conversation will start. Don't rush too fast and also don't be someone your not. It's a good thing that you are infatuated with this person but where does walking and looking at him ever help you out? If you can, and you see him working with his mom, go up to them and see if you can insist on helping, it would be better if she's working alone, then you could start talking to the mom and maybe the guy will come out and start asking who you are and then introduce yourself. But thats just if it happens. Be comfortable, be confident, this is something you want and you'll get it if you don't act like a little school girl. pursue it and don't miss out on the opportunity. Hope this helps, best of luck to you|`|s2puRm3Uaa	Sounds to me like your stalking him, your kidding yourself if u think ur not, "just going thru his window", are u crazy?|`|8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	Do not hop into his window.  That's kind of creepy especially if he doesn't know you that well.<br>  <br>  You just need to walk up to him and say "hi."  You can use any of the things you. saw him doing his way of opening the conversation.<br>  <br>  You should probably also open your mind up what can a guy you really want.  It sounds like you like this guy only because he's hot and you don't treat other guys very well if "ugly."  I think if you keep on this way of judging guys, you're going to get hurt and you're going to hurt a lot of guys in the process.  What you say you're doing to ugly guys very mean to them.  How would you feel this hot guy treats you with tdisrespect?
gBRJ0bq3aa	If you blew it with him it's for the best. I think what you did was the right thing texting and so on. I would have been pleased. I would have found it funny.  Anyway if you lost him, it is his loss not yours|`|4ugmTDOIaa	maybe the fact that you DID say you're not stalking him made him think that you are? guys are WEIRD...or maybe you thought the date went great but it didnt? dont think about it...let him call you!|`|NojtvCzcaa	Unless it was supposed to be a big secret that the two of you are going out, I don't know why he would have been irritated to see you at the game. Was it something he maybe didn't want his daughter to know? Or did she already know? He could have been irritated before you showed or maybe you misread his facial expression. I wouldn't worry about it. Wait for him to call you. If it takes longer than generally expected times two call him and see what the problem is. Whatever you do, don't stress about it, its probably nothing big anyway.|`|tgyGFgiMaa	No i dont think you did|`|bZsrX0Ytaa	Ask him.  It's all about communication...|`|CVfcSNc1aa	NAh, call him and make a coffee date.  Don't bring up the episode at the basketball game.

I would ask him in a nice way, if the reason that the relationship is going nowhere is because his family doesn't approve.  Even if he denies that he is influenced by his family, he will either start doing things to move toward marrying you, or he will talk and do nothing.  If he does nothing for 90 days, you should start making other plans without him.

I look at the personality first if its a quiet little girl it's not my type.. As far as looks it can go several ways. I really like shorter girls but on top of that I have a fiance that is taller than I am and she's beautiful. Legs are a big thing. The butt is another thing very appealing to a man. I believe that scum men are all about breast but then again I could just be weird? Anyways legs but smile eyes stomach and not ratty hair. Most attractive I would have to say it's between a nice stomach not to butchy or a nice butt. Not a big huge one either like a nice rounded one I'm not sir mix alot lol.|`|VWuT4oeyaa	I love a girls smile and eyes, but i must admit i do love breasts so much, that is one thing that i cannot stop looking at!|`|FGQu5DjXaa	first of all the face and thn goin down to boobs...and thn a gud body shape....fatty ones are so borin.....
OwBPVVx8aa	I think its perfectly fine to talk to some of his friends back home. The only way to get to know him is to know his friends and family, you know. Another thing, the girl that you talked to might be an old gf or something and their friends now, but maybe he doesn't want personal information to get out about him. Tell him that you think his friends are really cool back home and you would like to get to know them better, since they are the other half of his life, you know. If he has a problem with it, ask him why? There might be something he doesn't want you to know about!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|3td1R6gqaa	Well, I think that it is okay to introduce yourself. Yes, it's true that you should've asked first, but your boyfriend should've said that it's ok. Talk to him and find out why he's feeling the way he is, and try to work out a compromise. It's good to make new friends, and this way, when you and your bf go to the UK, you won't feel awkward in front of anybody! I think that it'll work out in the end. good luck!|`|ce150cba77d5a8e4bc72290ebf1eb4f6aa	Okay, A. Whats the problem with you introducing yourself to your guys friends...? Whats he hiding anyway??

I went through this same depression when my boyfriend moved two months ago. Although, he only moved to another city I still missed him like crazy when he first left. But we started to talk on webcam and by the yahoo computer phone and things started to get much better. I am able to see his face everyday and to hear his voice. It makes me feel much better and lets me know that the relationship is still working. Try talking with him on webcam with yahoo messenger and voice. It will take some of the sting away. Just know that if it is true love it will survive the distance and time. <br>  <br>  Take care|`|c8tYXvI5aa	Trust me it gets better with time.. Distance makes the heart grow fonder so dont worry if you guys really love each other then this will only strengthen your bond..

The bottom line is,there<br>  is not much you can do.While the child is with you try to give him the<br>  most stable environment that you can filled with honest love and values.Her drama is stemmed from hurt and fear, try to be understanding of that. Unfortunately it's the kids that get in the middle.|`|htWw0OlCaa	What you need to remember is that kindness kills..... And your husband needs to take her to court for visitation rights, and if he already has them then he needs to enforce them. Don't let her get to you, just be as kind as you can when you have to talk to her, and don't let anything she says or does gets to you. Because it will piss her off to know that she isnt getting to you. Eventually, she will get over her jealousy and see that what ever she does doesn't have an effect on you and she will hopefully give up. Best wishes
oUDDsVu5aa	Yes I know a guy like this I am one but this sounds like he is still in love with her and is trying to steal her from u the letter he has sent says one thing but means another he is trying to win her heart and would drop his current wife like a bad habit for her and is hoping she will do the same to you and be with him but the difference between him and I is I would not intrude on another marriage if I loved her and she is truly happy that is what I would want for her to be happy in life this guy is letting her know if your not happy like I am not happy them lets make some changes in both our lives that is what the letter really says between the lines he is hitting on your wife without actually saying it if I was you and she was my wife and I love her I would respond to his letter with this.<br>  I am sorry for your loss and your blindness back then also I am grateful to you for being so selfish and stupid to through away a wonderful woman like I have the honor of calling my wife be cause her love is true and my love for her is greater now than your love was back when you had your chance with her but found other thing more important than her i found her to be more important than anything else in your letter you say you married your current wife for convenience and there is no love there well this shows your character and a man if you were a true romantic and not a selfish jerk trying to ruin the happiness that me and my beautiful wonderful wife have together.See unlike you I truly love my wife and married her for love I am a man of honor not greed or selfishness like yourself. I will talk to her about you and respect her wishes concerning you but rest assured unlike you I feel she is worth more than anything else in this world.<br>  I respectfully ask you once and only once not to try and contact my wife again you have said your piece and achieved your goal as stated in your letters contents but please know this i have read your letter and i can read between the line the contents and motive of your letter just as she does and I am letting you know I am not a fool like yourself i would never treat her less than she deserve to be treated a wonderful woman. So that being said if you try and contact her again in any way I will not be as understanding as I am now trust and believe I will hunt you and find you and destroy you completely you mind body and spirit i will not stop until you know without a doubt you are so near death you can see the red in deaths eyes so don't make me end your life like you are trying to do to mine. understand this and embed it in your mind sire I will not give up my love as you did as easy as you did the best thing I can suggest to you is find love for your current wife and learn to live with it because things like your trying to do now is only going to make her a widow I hope I have made myself perfectly clear and if you still have any doubt in your mind how much i love my wife then feel free to test me but rest assured you will not find me very friendly and respectful to you in fact your test will be more for your fight for survival from me beating you to a bloody pulp<br>  <br>                                signed the lucky man who truly loves the woman you threw away also the man who will stop you dead in your tracks if you ever try to hurt her again DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME SIRE<br>  have a nice life and I wish I could say it has been a pleasure but it has not been having to make you understand that I am not as big of a fool as you think I am|`|kHRD7uUAaa	dude you lost me but the woman probably still had feelings as well  you just didn't know it|`|vb6nB7ANaa	yeah im lost to you need to write that out again.|`|kZb8QyfKaa	Mannn.. there are some reallly crazy people on here today..|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Sorry to say but your wife is just a bit being immature.

e1wj1yjkaa	It's just a sign of confidence. I wouldn't base it on whether somebody likes you or not. You could be giving the impression on liking someone when you look into thier eyes, but you could also just be giving a confident impression, which could cause this person to like you. Either way it's a good thing.|`|R2FK48Ujaa	it means that you are both paying attention to one another.  While one person is talking one person is listening and making contact and the person who is talking is looking to see how they react.  Thats the way it is by human nature.  If they don't make contact then they clearly don't care.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that looking at them gives an impression but it does give good potential.  If two people are looking at each other then they already have a symbiotic bond happening.<br>  <br>  hope this helps.
O1jBM3jgaa	It sounds like the person you're with,  aged you 10 years, the only thing I can say is to get out and find yourself again, be the person you were before you got involved.|`|7JnqIHxtaa	Well if this has only recently happened and only since you've been in this relationship it sounds like the person you are with is either holding you back or just does not bring out the best in you.  Are they a self-motivated person or lazy?  I have been feeling a lot of that same thing.  My guy never wants to go do anything and thinks that the stuff I want to do is silly and childish.  That can make you feel old.  I don't know what to tell you though.  I guess try to make yourself happy and do what you feel like doing to make you feel your age instead of older.|`|uaBqSLxuaa	I will be honest, in my opinion you have to stop that relationship and dream again, find your goals in your life, because life has only one recital, no second chance, only one. You mustn't miss it because when you get old you'll cry for all the thing that you could do and you didn't. And remember that for the rest of your life, don't let anyone to ruin what you want and who you want to be. Good luck.

If he is still not interested... move on hun!|`|AGaeOFcfaa	Good Morning: Truthfully I'd get on with your life...it's been 5 months & you've said that he has already told you that he doesn't like you..if you think talking with him might help....have talk with him & be honset about your feelings towards him...or write him a letter...& see what his response is...don't get your hopes up...sometimes things happen for a reason...keep yourself busy...one day you'll figure out the reason...you'll meet the right person in time...<br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  Sea ya<br>  Daytripper<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck to you|`|O1jBM3jgaa	Question him on this and say "if you say you don't like me anymore then why are you allways smiling at me?"<br>  or<br>  It could be that he is just being friendly with you and doesn't want to come across as a jerk,  in other words he's just being nice.|`|vQM7JTZjaa	from what i noticed, the best thing is to talk to people, what you like or dont like. and be honest. what can be worse?think:what can be worse than it is already?<br>  think the whole situation, go talk to him ,and than u know where u stand.<br>  if one of you is not sincere,than you two are a lost cause.
n46ygzlXaa	i say a friend like that is not worth being a friend, a friend never pulls a friend into bad stuff, and i can c u r good friend stopping her all this but no use if she doesn't listen and pulls u into it too...
mYBqb0c9aa	first of all you have to stop this self harming later in life you'll regret doing it and you'll wonder why like me i did it and i regret it. I have cuts on my arms and i cant wear a t shirt wihtout wearing arm bands to hide them but next time you feel like you have to harm yourself hold ice cubes instead you'll still feel the pain but it wont leave any marks. <br>  <br>  next why you are blaming yourself for what has happened might have some psychological factors involved. you could feel guilty at the fact that your mum has cancer probably because you felt you never spent a lot of time with her. you regret not having spent enough time with her. you need to realise that these things happen they say 1 out of 3 people will get cancer so its very common. <br>  <br>  also the school that you are in now seems like living hell probably because you dont know anyone there. Try making new friends to help the time fly by. but if thats not the case then try talking to someone about your problem the more you keep it to yourself then the worse you'll feel hope this helps|`|n46ygzlXaa	can u logically explain it to me or to anyone that its your fault or u are the reason for all the things are happening??? life is like that and thats the bitter truth, and u cant do nthn besides being being patient, time mends everything, no matter how bad it is...<br>  <br>  Ask urself one question, if u hurt urself or end ur life, how is it going to help anybody? what influence wil have on ppl related to u? will ur dad be happy by the loneliness caused after u r gone??? or wil ur mom b happy to know that her daughter died, before she did???|`|8qwuKTQraa	nothing here is your fault!! NOTHING NOTHING NOTHING!! please dont feel this way,. a while ago my grandpa shot himself and all i could think about was it being my fault! i cant imagine the pain your going thuough but i can relate. let me tell you something. those scars from cutting yourself dont fade they are always there to remind you. like a haunting so stop now it isnt makeing anything better and it will only make things worse in the long run. you can make more friends and for now there wil be one person you can spill everything to and i promise he wont juge you. his name is Jesus. thearpy is not for people who are broken. and counseling isnt bad at all trust me ive been there befor. talk to your school counseler. if you make her promise not to tell anybody then she cant, nobody has to know about it and you can get out of class for awhile. things are going to be alright. and if your mothre sews you for her getting canare then you can counter sew for harrassment. and get CASH if you win! that means your dads lost job wont be a proplen for a long time. cash wont make it all better but to help calm doun try meditation. just lay down relax and breathe out the negative and in the positive. then you can go to any relaxing place you want. as long as it is positive. a fantisy world is the best!! i realy hope everything turns out ok! good luck sweetie.|`|D9Ew8sLzaa	I may not have the answer to your life, but I know who could help you JESUS. I don't know if you ever invited him in your heart, but I guarantee you that he will change your life it has to start with you to take hold of him. He is your friend and always there for you even though you don't see him he is reaching out to you and he is hoping and praying that you reach out to him, Please take my advise and see the change in your life. I'll be praying for you and God LOVES you because he created you and you have a purpose in your life.<br>  If you need a friend I'm here issysweetness@yahoo.com|`|bWINcybJaa	Hope you don't mind i copied your statement to make a point.<br>  <br>  "  i dont want to go to therapy its for people who are broken and im not broken "<br>  <br>  which is all the more reason to go, i'm glad i went years ago or i would be broken today. not going to a therapist is like your on a dark street and you hear these foot steps following you and there getting closer and closer, that's the bad news, the good news is you just realized, you happen to be standing in front of a police station, are you not gonna seek there help also?<br>  <br>  To tell you not to feel what your feeling would be ludicrious, no one is in your shoes right now and you seem to have some pretty serious issues, quite frankly they won't go away for some time but they'll stay a lot longer if you don't seek professional help.  good luck to you.
zTIaynl7aa	Best thing I can suggest...and this is from personal experience...if the attraction is that strong...what are you going to lose right now? <br>  <br>  Also, most importantly...trust your gut.....i have learned the hard way on this....your natural instinct as a female will guide you....if you suspect or have doubts...don't persue....let it go and move on....<br>  <br>  Please keep me informed on the progress too<br>  <br>  If nothing has even really started, you aren't risking losing anything right now. If he is that shy...you will have to be the one to make the first move...close your eyes and breath deeply...and just whisper silently to yourself for a sign from the heavens....trust me, it works....<br>  <br>  Good Luck !|`|AA10277662	ask him one question DO U LIKE ME|`|WaPoUvyAaa	he's in some of your classes, so if i was you, i'd go and and ask him for help on an assingment or something... just to start converstaion and see how things go

5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	It depends on the country you are living in.  <br>  By the way, this happened to us and it is a horrible thing.  My father told my brother that he wanted his wife looked after, but after she died their house would come to us,his children.  He didn't leave a will and within a week of my father's funeral, she had sold the house.  And as she has two children, guess who's going to get the money!<br>  Yes, she should be provided for.  But actually, my father's money should not go to her children.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I forgot to say.  Talk to a lawyer and see what the law in your country says.|`|wnFaCgrMaa	I think you have to realise that your parent had remarried and although you may feel neglected, this was your parents spouse and is legally entitled to any estate.  If there was no will, you can't really contest it but if you are under 18 yrs old you would be classed as a dependant and may have some claim.  You don't say how long they were married but I'm sure that if your parent had wanted you to benefit directly there would have been some provision for you. Hopefully your step parent will be good to you now or in the future.  I found myself in the same position with my stepchildren.  My husband had given me verbal instructions but had written nothing down.  I was unable to tell my stepchildren because they would have been hurt.  I am trying in every way to honour what he wanted whilst at the same time providing for their future and for me it's not been a pleasant process.  I hope yours does the same.|`|AA10260487	if they was married your still waiting in line not alot you can do..|`|iFRTWg9Jaa	I don't know the law FOR SURE, but my guess would be that the law would state that your step parent would have the right to the estate if there is no will.  I am pretty sure that if there is no will, the estate would automatically go to the surviving spouse.<br>  <br>  Like I said, I can't say that for sure, because I can't quote specific laws or anything, but that would certainly sound like the way it would be.  Marriage means a lot in those instances.<br>  <br>  If you're really concerned.. I would suggest consulting a lawyer to find out for sure what the law is.

(in ogni caso se alla ragazza non piace te ne dovresti accorgere perchè cerca di evitarlo).

I'm sorry for you, but can't help to think that you opened this door for him.|`|SCg3kDz2aa	I think you two are young enough to have some fun around. Maybe it is time to sit down and discuss your future, how and what to do. STD? You may check it, it is always useful, independently of  any known cheating.|`|RCfc9hMKaa	It sucks when someone cheats on you, I'm sorry. It sucks even worse that he gave you gonorrhea... You need to give it some time before you consider forgiving him, I get the impression this happened very recently. You've got to consider whether you want him back and if you actually can forgive him. Don't get back together with him just so you can go to Spring Break. I would sell the plane tickets yourself. There are plenty of people looking to go somewhere for Spring Break and as long as you tell lots of people you have them, offer a decent price, and unload them to the first person who can pay you cash up front, you should come out ahead. Don't gamble on holding them for a friend who will "get the money to you" because you might miss the opportunity to get rid of them. And you don't have to sell them for dirt, but I wouldn't go into it assuming you'll make a profit either. The most important thing is that you get rid of them. You could even put them on craigslist.|`|djUMvICoaa	You have different levels of acceptability for cheating?  That's crazy, either you cheated or you didn't, the rest is immaterial.  It sounds like both of you weren't sure of this relationship, so it must be time to move on and learn from it.  And why weren't you using protection?  Are you nuts?  You're lucky that's all he gave you with what is being passed around out there.  As far as the plane tickets, take a girlfriend along, you sure wouldn't consider taking him would you?|`|29de67f94c5490271c7a3619e58bf1d5aa	So you cheated on him but nothing like that huh lol.. Sorry i find that line amusing.. Not to make light of your situation but first off no man or women is worth this much stress. As far as the std you made a mistake by trusting this man in the first place. It's something your just going to have to learn to live with.  Please seek therapy life's to precious just to throw away. And as far as the tickets? You  have way more pressing issues.|`|vZj1LH16aa	People are kids to give you answers like eye for an eye... Please grow up!<br>  <br>  My suggestion to you is just forget him and move on. If you can't get those tickets refunded, then forget it and think of its as a lesson. <br>  <br>  Trust me, you won't able to go through this event even if you tries to forgive him. That's life. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|msGQPrrjaa	Sounds it was just a fun thing.He probabally didn't mean it.You have cheated on him.What's the Dif?Sounds like you guys have a messed up relationship.Go on the trip and question your motives|`|0ox8VKwKaa	You both need individual and couples counseling to start|`|GqI8wY8Iaa	Don't waste your time on him. Tickets you say. Call me.|`|hQMiSlvMaa	An eye for an eye lol<br>  <br>  you cheated on him first|`|7twY5OIuaa	Hey, don't be so down on yourself. You guys cheated on eachother and it was a terrible lesson to learn but you've learned that you two aren't right for eachother. As for the plane tickets, sell them and if they are not transferrable then I'm afraid you'll have to be out the money because at this point, going to spring break with him will just be a disaster and you are in no shape to deal with anymore emotional trauma. Men always get worse in these situations before they get better and men are super skilled at leaving the emotional baggage with the person(s) who'll just take it.|`|FYdq7RVLaa	No sympathy,now you know how he felt(if you told him)|`|vpRRw49vaa	Your an idiot if you go

In such occassions be prepared to polish her shoe for the rest of your life.<br>  I dont think you're unfit for marrying any other girl. So at this age have more importance for your parents and your career. These two never comeback once lost.  Keep your cool, mind your business, if she has anything left for you she'll comeback. <br>  Please take care of yourself do not think of those who love you or someone else or whatever. One last thing, If some one doesnt love you or like you, its their problem and not yours.

Not to worry. just move on with ur life as she will with other guy.|`|7DSuEjUOaa	First off I'm sorry to hear this... I will say the best way to go about this in my opinion would be either ask her about this and tell her how you feel before it's too late. Or Maybe you should really think of something to change the relationship. Maybe she has just became bored.. Tink of something you both did when you first met and just do something fun again. Splurge on her for a night make her feel special. I hope I helped you. Good luck bro.|`|c4dcfa84514bd5e3c000ac273d6e22a8aa	VEERESH,<br>  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME IN WAITING A GIRL WHO IS NOT INTERESTED.

Dating is used to help determine if the one you're with is the one you want to marry. And I'm sure, that on a thirteen-year old's mind, is not marriage. So thirteen might be too young to have a girlfriend.|`|GdsBrHIdaa	no, its not...<br>  just dont get too carried away|`|4USvZW6vaa	i don't think so.. love has no age guide lines.. if u love her then let her know!
H7TqK6N1aa	sometimes life can be a downer, don't take it so hard on the chin. try and just step back and laugh at the absurdity of it all. try and join some campus clubs or sports teams. getting active is good! or maybe even find a study group if you don't have time for extracurriculars at least you'll have like minded folk to hang out with and take the stress out of schoolwork.<br>  <br>  as for the movie folk, they're losers just playing off on you being alone. maybe the choice of a happier movie might have gotten you a nicer crowd!|`|LkHzsRcDaa	If there are clubs that you are interested in and have time, join them. That's probably the best way to meet new friends. Don't try too hard getting phone numbers and such, just be nice and friendly; like you are trying to make friends. Otherwise, just think of going somewhere that provides good opportunity for interaction and making friends. Besides that, you need to understand and see whether a girl likes you or not before approaching her for a dance or date. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0qspJSt9aa	well you can ask this advice at jamrie.com<br>  its more of a personal advice website.<br>  people over there might be able to help you out.<br>  <br>  i go there all the time!|`|9K8Zksfwaa	maybe youre ugly?|`|IGDaE5Lkaa	You've got to have confidence in yourself. Maybe if you stop referring to girls as "females" and substitute it for "girls" maybe they'd think your less of a scientist studying them and more of a guy interested in them. Also, the muscles thing means you're trying a little bit too hard. Reign it back, take a deep breath, and chill out. If you're at a party and want to dance with a girl, talk to her a little bit first, find out her name, what classes she takes, things like that, and then ask if she's like to dance. Women love a gentleman.|`|vp8806Eraa	what do you like to do? what are your interests?<br>  <br>  Join some clubs for those interests. You'll meet people who'll share your interests, and friendship with those people should come naturally. You can't force people to like you - just relax and be yourself, and people will be drawn to your personality.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, then start selling drugs. Everyone likes a drug dealer.|`|wXQwX67uaa	Meh...<br>  I feel bad for you. I would at least try to be more self confident and out going. No don't go behind someone.Go to like a costume party or something and put on a mask.Then you can ask someone to dance.<br>  If you find out who the person you danced with was and she enjoys your presence then you can show her who you really are and then try to get somewhere.|`|GGwOjodDaa	............. too much imformation............................|`|9Ua6tAU0aa	Just get out there!

Approach people..always with a smile and just be yourself. I'm a Senior in high school, and I used to be really shy in the younger years, but I have just sucked it up and always was the first to say hello. People like self-confidence! so just be that person.  Your'e not alone in the world and someone will appreciate your strive.|`|jHIIsXKmaa	studying while working keeps you you busy, but you get to learn a lot right? how can you say that you're not sociable? don't you have a set of friends, rather close friends whom you usually hang out with? a guy who is attractive but has no confidence is a no-no, but a guy who is confident even if he only looks average will attract more ladies. so you really should work on your confidence. why should you be shy around the ladies? did you do anything embarrassing before? as long as you didn't, there's no reason to be shy.<br>  <br>  yes, instead of getting a girl's number as your priority in attending parties, why don't you get to know them first? say "hi, how are you" introduce yourself. BE CONFIDENT even if you're nervous. try practicing in front of the mirror. of course, don't expect good results already, you've got to practice. and instead of finding a girl at a party, why don't you start at your classroom? ask about the assignment or something. as for watching a movie alone, what's wrong with that? i sometimes do that because i want to enjoy my time alone. as for those guys who did that, they are so immature. <br>  <br>  remember, study hard, work hard, by the time you graduate, you will be able to have a great resume, then you'll have a good job and you'll be able to party everyday. hope i helped you with the problem.

She wants to see if there's something better than you out there. Shes finding out there's not and she keeps coming back to you because you make her feel better.

Giving it to you all in a nutshell. 19 is way to young to know what you want out of life. And for you to keep pressuring her is going to do nothing but drive yall farther apart. My advice is tell her you love her express the way you feel and what you want. In the mean time date around yourself, keep in touch with her and down the road if things are meant to be they will. Im sure you have heard this on more then one occasion but ive been through this as well and if i had listened it would have saved me allot of grief..|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Tell her what you feel and what you want to have happen to make you happy.

Good because she treated you not just a friend but 'best friend' Just always be with her at all times especially if she's lonely. There are just few people she trust and your one of those! Sometimes, we must be selfless accdg. to the situation. Try to ask this to her, Do you love your bf? Wait for her answer. but if she does, respect her answer. Don't just tell your feelings right away but tell it to her step-by-step. You must be her bf because you still have *e*... TRY TO ASK HER during your *e* just ask it jokingly, uuhhmmm... do you love me? i mean even just a friend? you know? but still say this to her, "honestly, I still love you.... I need you...

I'm not a guy, no. But I've got 6 brothers. 6 older brothers. And they all have a girlfriend. Some of them have girly girls, some have sporty girls, one has a smart girl (she's sorta a nerd but she's not really). <br>  Personally, I am sort of in between, I play lots of sports, but I love to shop, wear heels and skirts, and so on. My boyfriend likes me for me. But if he had to choose he'd probably choose my more sporty side. But that's because he's the star soccer player in our town. He's into sports and he likes that I go to his games and actually understand what's going on. <br>  So it depends on the guy. I think that girls that look like barbies are pretty shallow. But that's just me|`|OTxLmitSaa	well.... im a guy and an athlete. my girl friend is not sporty but she is not one of these barbies either. she is one of the clever cute types (i love that). i hate women talking about sport the whole time (if i want to talk sport i like to talk to someone who knows what they are talking about.......like a guy). but at the same time i like her to have an interest in my gaes. so i guess cute girls who are in between.|`|dz8xeL2Naa	wellll<br>  im not a guy ;p <br>  but.<br>  usually guys that like girly girls like them just because of their big boobs<br>  blonde hair aka barbie look etc  those guys are usually the guys looking for quick sex and are jerks.. and guys into sporty girls probably arent looking for just sex. <br>  <br>  idk if that makes sense but yea!|`|7DSuEjUOaa	I love girls that are more tuff.

If you love your husband like you say then let him go, let him be happy & live his life, why hurt him keeping him with you ? at first its hard to adjust to a different life but with time everything gets easier & you too will find someone who will care for you. You live only once, both of you should move on and live your own lives.

Give yourself time enough to heel from your previous relationship with your husband, before you jump into another relationship with someone else. Although it is nothing wrong with having a friend or maybe someone to talk to, you should be very careful and sure to not make the same mistakes, that you may have caused in the past. finding the right man takes time, it's not something that will happen over night, and you can't keep running back and forth between your past relationships. slow dow and relax a minute. I can understand how you feel because I am going through the same thing, with my ex-boyfriend. instead, of me turing to a man, I have decided to give God a chance in my life to fix some errors I have made. I do want a good man one day in my life, but first I have to love myself before any man in the streets can, and one day the right man will come along, but try God first, and you can't go wrong................

BcVAWOCLaa	I think there is a better way to put it…..men don’t tell the whole truth.  When we flat out lie, it is because we really don’t care about the girl (at least for myself).  If I tell a girl something, but leave out the bad things, I did not lie.  Girls don’t need to know everything, but when the time comes, we will tell them the rest of what happened.  Guys put up walls, and it takes a long time for them to drop them.|`|crKEVJi5aa	Stop generalizing. Why do Women lie?|`|5F1gcXf1aa	Men lie because they can get away with it. Some men even go as far as believeing their own lies! They think they are in control of the situation, when really their lies are exposing them in the open! Being mean-spirited, selfish, and a hipocrate, is the tall traits of man that lies. A liar is always scheming bad thoughts, and acting on it through behavior.|`|GV7086yoaa	The main reason men lie when you first meet them is because they are trying to impress you and they do not feel that they can empress you on their own merit for whatever reason. If you have known this man for a while and they continue to lie about things chances are they are hiding something.|`|OJoEYkPXaa	i don't know but i want to know|`|ZvG0nOM4aa	Because were either intimidated or in love and afraid to lose the women.|`|VUmM0yn5aa	cuz they have nothing better to do. it like a game to them. the constantly need somthing to entertain themselves. and the fact that they suck. yup, men suck. until i find a good guy. ha, like that will ever happen.|`|ealQku2daa	most men lie because they cant stand behind their truth,or maybe they know the person their lieing to is going to shot them down.it not so much why do men in our lives lie its how do we react to their truths|`|f7930e1b0e3632495c035cf67bd8dc26aa	they're hiding something

It sounds like you still have feelings for both of your exes. One more so than the other. Seems as if you can see things working out with your ex crush but your still hoping that there's something there with the ex boyfriend. Or you could have just had a weird dream.

74f131d3788f448b16909ed8ba41e5b0aa	Find out about the girl: what she likes to talk about, where she likes to hang out, what she likes to do, etc. Also find out her dislikes (you don't wanna be a part of her that if you can help it). Talk to her friends, guys and girls, ask them questions. Don't ask her too many typical first date questions, she'll feel like she's taking a survey. Unless of course that's what she likes. Do something fun that doesn't put pressure on both of you so you can relax and go with the flow. Taking mutual friends along might be a good idea, takes the pressure off (which I suggest). Try going to an amusement park or going to the movies and then dinner. You like sports right? Go to a game and dinner later to talk about it. If you're gonna go with the group date thing tell her you and some friends were gonna go out, ask her if she wants to bring some friends and join you. Oh, once the date is over don't stall, take her home. Awkward silence can really kill the mood. Never ask if you can kiss her. If it's gonna happen it'll happen. If it doesn't happen that night it's okay. Just give her a GOOD friendly hug. I hope that helps you.|`|480b10d5d50187e46c2e0aabc8a49865aa	ask her if she wants to go to the movies tonight its quick and easy and will get u some booty|`|4478cbffdbaf5dce373d855872ef948baa	17 year olds dont go on dates boy!! lol so u bore the ladies..hahhaa.. you aint got no game boy.. i bet this girl u like is a fat girl too if she is just take her to the food store

0mIc2ZC4aa	It is really bad. Thats really crappy and can hurt you in more ways than one. Believe me. But you have to know you are beautiful and perfectly fine. If you don't believe that then you gotta fix it. But its not right to say that. My dad used to do that to me. it was horrible and gave me confidence issues. You just need to stand up to her, because obviously you are better than her.|`|AA11427806	Your mum and aunty have personal issues of their own and are trying to feel better by picking on you. It will hurt until you learn to handle it better. Think about yourself, are you taking care of yourself the way you should? Why not? If you won't then who will? Live for you and learn to like yourself no matter what other people say. If they say you are "big", say " Yes I am. I'm build for comfort." Smile and walk away. Don't mistreat yourself and don't let words mistreat you. Be Good.|`|5X8T2gdIaa	Don't listen to what they say. They are probably just gossipers and like keep theirs mouths moving with something to talk about. Don't feel bad.|`|ihCZ7ddOaa	This has left you deeply affected! You say that your mum always tries to bring you down - does that mean that she is always saying negative things to you to make you feel bad about yourself?<br>  Its really hard when you don't have support from your parents. They are the one person that you want to be proud of you. Anything less feels like rejection.<br>  When you don't have support from family however, hard as it is, but you have to start to support yourself. You need to believe that you deserve good things in your life (without being selfish about it of course), that you deserve happiness, and love.<br>  In your question, it sounds as though your mother is the child. Kids are usually the ones who say silly things, then laugh about it. <br>  I might be going out on a limb here, and be completely wrong, but I will say it anyway.<br>  If you are bigger, and you are sensitive about it, you need to try to work out why. What has happened in your life to make you feel insecure? Is your weight a health issue, ie disease? Or is it that food is a comfort thing? If food is your comfort, then you need to work out why you need the weight to be your security blanket. It usually comes down to something that happened that affected you in a big way, and that you needed some form of self protection. <br>  If this is the case, you are probably doing it to make predators find you ugly, but in the process, when other people comment on you, it becomes an insult. What most people don't realize is, if you are doing this to be unattractive to predators, then you need to know that predators will always be there, and are attracted to anything with a low self -esteem. The weight isn't the issue to the predator, its how you feel about yourself, that makes them attracted to you.<br>  Having said that, if something did happen to you, its not your fault that it happened. Thats why a predator is a predator, they hunt for people they feel that they can dominate.<br>  Regardless of any of this, go and find yourself an assertiveness or self-esteem course. This will help you to cope with difficult situations and provide you with some great coping skills.<br>  Best of Luck :)|`|kk3qldkFaa	i think that is so rude of your mom and aunt.

3FvkcjAOaa	ANche il mio fidanzato si masturba da solo, e sinceramente, io pure. E anche noi facciamo l'amore in modo più che soddisfacente, tutti i giorni- La masturbazione, è un modo per prendere confidenza con il proprio corpo e la propria sessualità. Sai, mi è capitato che quando non ci siamo visti per un giorno, lui il giorno dopo mi ha detto di essersi masturbato pensando all'ultima volta in cui abbiamo fatto l'amore. Questa è una cosa bellissima. Vedi, non serve per allontanarvi, bensi serve per farvi sentire più vicini e più complice. Se sei in grado di capire questo, e di far si che non venga guardato da te con occhio accusatore quando te lo confida, lui ti sarà immensamente grato e il vostro rapporto diventerà ancora più intenso e intimo. Perchè non provi a vincere il tuo dubbio e il tuo tabù chiedendogli di farlo una volta di fronte a te?|`|3NcvrpGMaa	Dagli una mano quando sei indisposta o fagli un bel lavoretto orale...|`|491rrgIqaa	Ragazze, è normale che i ragazzi si masturbino...la masturbazione per loro non è legata alla soddisfazione sessuale, anche se stanno bene con la loro ragazza si masturbano e non c'è proprio nulla di male...è un modo che hanno per ritagliarsi un momento intimo solo per loro...io so benissimo che il mio moroso lo fa (me lo dice eh eh) e non ci trovo nulla di strano...|`|4faaba4aa4d438469dba2fe9cf57b825aa	lo lascerei fare....meglio quello piuttosto che metta il naso fuori per cercar Qualcun'Altra con cui scaricare...|`|Q4Ze0Bojaa	Non mi darebbe fastidio, anzi, probabilmente lo farei anch'io|`|WUYm4lB9aa	Aiutalo .|`|a4cRtipkaa	perchè arrabbiarsi scusa...è normale...se poi ci stai male c'è sempre un'altra soluzione...lo aiuti|`|TEeCePlxaa	ma figuriamoci, per nulla...perchè arrabbiarsi, è una cosa normale!!|`|UAj4RHYNaa	No, anzi!

8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	It's understandable to be uncomfortable going.   It sounds like you've already made up your mind about what kind of time you'll have, so it may not be worth it.  However,  If you do go, don't focus on her.  Chat to other people and leave when you're no longer having fun, no matter how long you've been there.<br>  <br>  You've done the right thing in letting her know how you feel.

Don’t let it ruin anything for you|`|AlNhH8Dzaa	Try to accept this person your friend is dating.<br>  <br>   Get to know him, so you can know if your friend dating him is okay.

Some love means letting them be happy no matter what.|`|cPBfVORxaa	i will go if it's me, because when u don't go, u show ur weakness, when u act u don't care, she may start to care about u .|`|344fca07219fb35dbfcb7edbc214204baa	Yup, girls will always go out with guys that are more itneresting than their current boyfriend.

Sex is usually a touchy issue for 16 yr old boys and girls.<br>  <br>  3.  Most people aren't comfortable mixing the ideas of sex and family.<br>  <br>  <br>  Only you and your son can really know if it's an issue.  I'd say it's only really a problem if one of you isn't comfortable or if you start resembling the story of Oedipus Rex.  <br>  <br>  Reading this, I was more concerned about "my younger bf."  How many boyfriends do you have?   I don't fully know your situation, but you may wish to consider what message you may be conveying to your children about sex, promiscuity and fidelity.|`|GpzBO3mnaa	As long as you aren't doing the incest thing then no biggie.|`|bocujnngaa	Well, that's interesting. It's great that you and your son have a close bond but this may effect him in the future. Most 16 year old boys don't talk to their mothers this openly. I think that talking to your son about these deep and personal subjects may make him fantasize about YOU or other girls in a bad way. Don't be affended  by this question but, Are you sexually attracted to your son? Is this why you have no problem talking about it with him? <br>  <br>  The reasons it may effect him in the future is because when he grows up and gets married or has a serious girlfriend, his girlfriend is not going to really like the fact that he talks about the same things to her and he does with his mother!!! His girlfriend will definately be jealous of the close bond you two have. <br>  <br>  I think that it's alright to be really close to your kids, but that is just wayyyyyy too close....he knows his mom is a "horny" YUCK <br>  <br>  ~Best of Luck~|`|TcDnkLPtaa	okkkk lol|`|zo5DDYHsaa	It's good you and your son are so close.

I wouldn't contact him anymore than two to three times total.  After that, the ball is in his court.  Otherwise you risk looking clingy and needy.
y5jc8e8vaa	oh my gosh yes! that can happen, especially if you are as you described. you sound so wonderful! and I can understand any girl who went out with you that thought you could get a better and more beautiful girl, not saying that you would, mind you.<br>  <br>  its just that girls like to know that they are the only one in your life worth taking chances for, and if you start looking the other way, even a little, they lose all self confidence and wonder if you even like them.<br>  <br>  also; if this girl is someone that thinks "hey, I am so not perfect..." and she ends up with a guy like you and starts listening to everything he's done and everything he can do, they start wondering "how did I get this guy? is he really into me? and if he meets someone better, will he just up and leave me?" then she goes into defensive mode, breaks up with him, and says to herself "its better this way, I wont get hurt later and neither will he."<br>  <br>  these thoughts haunt many a girl's minds....|`|BfOujTfLaa	You have to tell her how much you love her and let her know that she is the only one that you see.|`|8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	It's not a matter of being too perfect, it's a matter of being in the "same circle."    First, a girl, probably without much esteem, might be intimidated, partly worried that someone as accomplished as you will eventually find someone more stimulating then her. Second, it can also be a matter of what you have in common.   People tend to gravitate towards others who have similar skills, goals and accomplishments, as well as stations lin life.  It helps form a commonality bond.<br>  <br>  People also like having partners who are challenging, and some people may feel they are not challenging enough for you, that they really don't bring anything to the relationship.<br>  <br>  Just be who you are and keep trying.   No one person can get any other person whenever they wish!  Even supermodels sit home alone.|`|5d3bbc1cbc9b9e265cb7150e219da54aaa	OH GOD YES! I am completely turned off to men that seem too perfect because I am not. I sort of feel that way about my boyfriend, he is knock dead georgous, and I feel like he can have any women he really wants....and that is so intimidating to a woman, she thinks your always gonna cheat and that shes not the only one. I would say that the only thing that has kept me there with my b/f is that he is completely opposite than being cocky...he doesnt put himself down but he is not a self promoter, he doesnt know how to take a compliment, and ACTS like he is homely.....that's the only reason I went out with him...|`|743cde4e1380191a8acb49cc2b7e4e7daa	Being too perfect can come of as BORING! I find flaws kinda cute in a guy, but it's really up to the girl you're dating.|`|R5O4llRDaa	Well, it's not really a turnoff in and of itself, if the chemistry otherwise is there.  Only bad if it comes along w/ being cocky, which you say you are not. <br>  <br>  It's hard to gain girls' trust.  Most of us have been cheated on at some point (often by very "flawed" guys, at that) and many of us don't have the confidence to date someone we really, really like because we're so afraid of getting hurt.<br>  <br>  So I guess you'll just have to take it slow when dating someone you want to pursue a long term relationship with, i.e. prove that you're trustworthy and won't cheat.|`|bp2hibPTaa	girls need constant reminders that you find them beautiful, and a joy to be with them. Tell her she looks really cute tonight, or beautiful, or insert adjective you wish. after your date is done, tell you had a great time, and can't wait to see her again. Call her, and show her some initiative. It can go along way <br>  Girls tend to be insecure with themselves, so just feed into it a little bit. It's not that hard to do, and it really can make or break a relationship<br>  also explain to the girl, that no who comes into your life. she is the one you want no matter what, just don't tell her she's special to you, make sure you show it to her. be wary of the subtle things|`|SPyjAte7aa	No but a guy who thinks he is too perfect can be a turn off.|`|T9ZBxaP3aa	so, she is insecure. tell that ********* to kick rocks and find a girl who isnt insecure or afraid of a challenge. most people like perfect to a degree, but too perfect is boring. so tone down the "im to sexy" thing or people will find you to be boring.

If the child is his business seriously a problem.  Basically, she needs to make a decision on whether she wants to break up with him or were trying to make their relationship work.  Do not be "the mistress" because that cannot lead to anyplace good.|`|RcLaLuvhaa	this may not be the easiest answer.<br>  <br>  leave.it.alone.<br>  <br>  you may  -feel- like yall have something, but truth be told, she is better for her boyfriend , with whom she has a CHILD with.<br>  she and her husband have problems, and it would be a terrible illlustration of your character to take advantage of that. women need affection and she is looking to you, but let her know that she needs to be looking to her boyfriend.
8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	Well, to answer your title question, yes, it's possible because people stay in relationships for different reasons other than love.  In your case, it does sound like a weird phase but one that unfortunately means you will no longer be together.  When he said he's training to become a "youth minister" that caught my attention.  How religious was he while he was in the relationship with you?  It may also be that he never did like you as a girlfriend but really thought he did all that time.  However I find this unlikely. <br>  <br>  Try letting him know that you find it strange that you don't fully believe him , but not in such a way that you think he's lying.  Ask him if there's something else going on and to  be honest with you.|`|9icgq9PMaa	Wat a lame excuse! he might fall in love with another girl.|`|AA11209207	I take it that you to nver "did it".

pcp1DnEwaa	Um, yeah, I'd be worried.  First off, if you put the condom on wrong, get another one!  (and how could you have no idea if you got off again?)  If you can't go about having sex responsibly, then in no way are you even ready for it.  You have every right to be worried and I hope that you have learned your lesson from this and act more responsibly.|`|8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	None of us were there, so we can't tell you exactly.  It doesn;t sound likely, but I hope you learned to be more careful next time.   You may also need to do more research, by book or asking doctors on safe methods.  If she is your girlfriend, sugges tthe pill as a backup.|`|myG2hhaKaa	You are probably fine, but only time will tell.|`|75wqs7GWaa	yes you need to worry you should of put on another one instead turning it back around your spurm could of got on it
AA12095283	Wait till September and ask her out|`|8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	You already asked this and I already answered it.  My answer hasnt changed.
AA10273189	I'd say she can't be in a serious relationship right now, and is being honest about it..either way she is ending it...she has respect for you to have put it this way....stay friends and it could end up more.|`|AA10517482	That's easy....the girl is saying in so many words "she's just not that into you!"period.|`|AA11387245	she's obviosly not ready for you.... she probably thinks you're gonna wake up one day and realize she's not as good as you think she is and break up with her. She's trying to save herself.... but maybe she's just hurting herself.|`|AA11389150	Okay, there are a few ways to interpret this.  Either:<br>  -She's afraid you are losing interest in her so she decided to end the relationship first to stop the possible "break-up pains".<br>  -OR-<br>  -She just doesn't feel the same way about you as before so she decided to break it off fast before getting you hurt.<br>  <br>  Personally, I think it's the second option.  Your "girl-friend" still likes you a lot, just not that way.  It's apparent that she still wants to keep you as a friend, and is scared that the break-up will make things awkward between the two of you.  That's why she repeated the phrase "I don't wanna get hurt"; to actually emphasize the fact that she doesn't want to get YOU hurt, and let you know that it's not you that's wrong in the relationship, it's her.|`|KV3oh2ihaa	She is scared....maybe she was hurt in a past relationship and doesn't want to take that chance again...perhaps she is really starting to like you and realizes that but at the same time doesn't want to take a risk of getting hurt...|`|W16WgXeMaa	well that really sucks apparent;y she  dont know what shes missing  ouy on : ]]|`|b985e1bb4dd7c02708ee4d73e11f0946aa	Nothing confusing here: she wants out of your relationship and she's telling you as gently as she can.
8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	We cant make this decision for you.<br>  <br>  Things to consider:  <br>  <br>  How much fun will you have playing badminton versus playing soccer? <br>  <br>  Who will be your teammates?<br>  <br>  You can always switch next year!<br>  <br>  You'll probably have fun regardless.<br>  <br>  Shyness doesnt really affect playing, or if it does, ythen you'd be uncomfortable even thinking about playing.  Shyness also comes and goes in high school
pj0jXyuzaa	I am not so sure that it is a trust problem.  I also feel that she does have a friendship with you and this is why she has confided things in you.  I just do not think that she wants the same thing you do.  This does not mean she is not a friend and I do not think she is using you.  If you offer someone in need, they having no other choice will accept your help.  That is not using but if you are expecting something in return then you are asking her to pay for the service (help) you have provided her.  Friends don't do that so accept what she is willing to have with you if you can.  Otherwise she will display more of the same tactics she did before..(IE:making you mad).  Hope this helps.|`|QdnH6oyMaa	look bro.. she has trust probs and u cant do anything about it.. leave her.. if u mean anything to her she will come to her.. dont chase her.. if she is yours she will come to u {}|`|XhNSFofUaa	If u really like her just try to talk to her more and find out what is her problem and if it is with her esx!|`|c96d809951ae4f99effc004865caeff8aa	You can't make her trust you.<br>  and chances are that she is using  you.<br>  If you have done things to help her and she is trying to anger<br>  you..she'll probably trying to just get rid of you.<br>  <br>  it's sweet that you want to help her,<br>  but she obviously doesn't care about you if she is hurting  you.<br>  <br>  give her..and especially yourself some space.|`|8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	If she won't trust  you, there's nothing you can do and it doesn;t soudn like you should take it personally.   Ironically, if you keep trying, she may get suspicious, though it may seem irrational.   All you can do is show her that you care about her then let her do the rest.<br>  <br>  You can try going more slowly.  The more people have been hurt, the longer it takes for them to trust again.

PykKgTWUaa	sometimes people get to comfortable, you should try to talk to her agian. but make sure you have spacific instances where she is treating you bas. evaluate your situation, weigh out the good and bad times. life is to short to be chaseing after someone who does not appreciate you. be sure that you are treating her with respect, try to be as sweet as you can possibly be. if she is still treating you bad, she may no longetr wnat to be in the relationship. sometimes people mistreat their signifigant other when they are attracted to someone else.|`|4OiwCqTRaa	just be like well you need to stop and tell her that you feel like you not loving her as much when she does it. she'll understand hopefully. but if she loved you too she would understand|`|FsBQ1NACaa	First of all, maybe she's not the one for you. But if you truly love her than just try to do some little acts of kindness, like bring her a bouquet of red roses or a romantic dinner, tell her you love her everyday, give her little compliments to make her smile. Then maybe she will start appreciating you more. But if she still stays the same i would say dump her...she's not the one.|`|d64b7586ccdd852355c2c4c75f12ea97aa	you better do something... do something that comes from you, not by us...... its going to be more better when you think your own idea..... get some advice to your parents..... that might be helpful......|`|GhcPdPIFaa	It sounds like you could both use a break.  Yes you will miss her, but it seems the adage; "If you love someone, set them free. If they come back they're yours; if they don't they never were." holds true here.  If she is mistreating you some distance might be beneficial for your relationship and the wake up call she needs.  You did not mention personal issues she might be having like unhappiness with her job, health or family problems; if that is the case she needs to deal with it.  Moreover; you could probably use a break from all the abuse she is dishing out.  Use the time alone constructively and try to determine if your GF is really right for you.  Good luck!|`|MoWIbDWXaa	This sounds almost exactly like what i just went through.  Well it could possibly be one of two things.  First, she might be angry/stressed about something, not necessarily you, and you are feeling the effects. Or she could be unsure of how she feels and is showing her frustration.  What you should probably do is do the most romantic thing you can think of.  To get this right make sure that you have an entire day together where nothing will bother her or you.  Then take her do something she loves i.e. ice skating, movie, shopping, etc. and pay for it.  Next if you have the means treat her to a home cooked meal made by you and have a special lunch/diner for 2.  Then i would suggest relaxing and just talking for a while and remember girls want only one "S" word SYMPATHY not! SOLUTION.  I hope everything works out let me know how it goes.|`|ZuceYCS9aa	Sit her down tell her that u love her if she dont change her ways maybe you should try 2 change your attitude say baby at the end of the sentence.And tell her if u love me u would change your ways say that|`|aAocLZ3raa	When the cons outweigh the pros in a relationship, it's probably time to reconsider the situation you're in. You're going to miss her if you guys break up, but that is inevitable. The more time you spend with a person, the more attached you're going to be to them. But time heals all wounds, and there are plenty of better girls out there for you. If you feel that this is going in the wrong direction, then maybe it's time to let her go.|`|dfd43cdc6f596dffbd1415477c0b12e3aa	the pain is only temperary, i say you should leave.  go with your gut, not your heart|`|fXy4LLIcaa	I sense there are some under lying problems with your girlfriend. Do some subtle investigation on what is bothering her. It could be her family or something else. Or may be she is attracted to some one else( it is a possibility). Find out the root cause, and your problems will be solved.|`|e149d8651ec2a8062fd5aee0bdd23a16aa	Leave that babe anyway...sounds like you are not the one she wants.  Johnny Cash wrote a song about that "It ain't me babe."|`|8ab62bcab301d81ad0fea7cabc2ec3baaa	You need to bite the bullet and leave her.    You have a choice.<br>  <br>  1.  Stay with her and be miserable<br>  <br>  2.  Leave and be miserable.<br>  <br>  The difference is that Number 2 doesn't last forever.  Number 1 will last as long as you are with her.
ba44e8b343919575da058c00dad2c4d2aa	I don't know how old you are, but if this is happening in the first year of your relationship, imagine how it will be 5 yrs from now. Obviously he has some anger issues out of no where. The more comfortable he gets with you, the more likely the anger will turn to violence. Even though you may think you live him, his actions are not really expressing love to you. Do you really want to live like that?|`|c5ec0014eaccadd1063404da7009e9a4aa	if you love him, then get past the fighting.  work at your relationship.   all men are like that.<br>  <br>  i have no clue what that first answerer was saying!|`|O1jBM3jgaa	If your finding it hard to forgive him, then I don't think you want this relationship anymore.

Be prepared for her not to come back; it may happen.  Feel free to ask her what's up with all the time apart, and ask her if she's confused .  Let her know its OK if she is and you understand, but naturally, you can't wait around forever.

Mi sembra comunque una cosa bellissima, soprattutto per come si comporta con te. E non sarà certo lui ad ostacolare tue nuove opportunità. Se invece lo facesse, sarebbe buon segno, no?|`|vNPGTjIMaa	Ciao. Mi trovo più o meno nella tua situazione. Io però vengo da una storia di 1 anno, lui è single. Anche lui mi ha fatto intendere che ci fosse un interesse da parte sua, sms dolci, lui carino e rispettoso con me. Io così ho creduto di interessargli veramente, così siamo usciti soli,  (è successo),ma  dopo lui ha detto lui che siamo amici e tali restiamo anche se gli piaccio un casino. I ragazzi hanno generalmente paura di impegnarsi. Però nel tuo caso, evidentemente questo ragazzo ha bisogno ancora di sbollire quei 4 anni di storia, di respirare un poco.... se vuoi restargli accanto, fallo, ma non ti illudere, non sperare. Le cose avvengono, senza che noi le anticipiamo. Abbi fiducia nella vita!|`|AnY5bZiTaa	Beh forse non si vuole impegnare subito perchè ha già avuto una storia lunga alle spalle.... Continua a frequentarlo e se dev nascere qualcosa in più all'amicizia stai tranquilla che verrà da sè!

Because you are infatuated with this guy, you will always be full of doubt nomatter what he does.<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like he moved to be with his friend AND to get away from the argueing girls. Don't take it hard, it wasn't you.
c52wF11maa	as hard as it is you can only help those who want to help themselves. I really dont think u can force someone to think a certain way, whether it be more responsible or mature. Good luck with your friend, maybe if nothing else you can be a positive example and a shoulder to cry on.|`|AA10567716	Unfortunately there isn't much more you can do... It sounds like you really love your friend, but it doesn't sound like she loves herself much...  <br>  <br>  All you can do is be there for her when she falls... <br>  <br>  However, protect yourself 1st and foremost!  Do not go to parties or to one of her older friends houses with her in an effort to protect her, because all you will be doing is putting yourself in harms way...  <br>  <br>  You can try to get her interested in more productive activities, but I really doubt that she will be interested... But it never hurts to try...<br>  <br>  Be strong... there WILL come a time when she is ready to listen and change and she will definitely need you then...<br>  <br>  Another point, don't think that because she isn't taking your advice, she doesn't care... She may really love you too, but she wants to do what she wants to do.  Keep in mind... the only one she is really hurting is herself... <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|nsvQAiXtaa	well i understand youre problem talk to her tell her that what shes doing is wrong and to get it together hes just lucky that her parents havent kicked out of the house and when she has no were to go what is she going to do then .
BgxSEH9waa	Yes it's normal to feel this way but it could really hurt your relationship with your girlfriend if you bring it up a lot or make her feel bad about it. It's hard to think about it like this but when you were having sex with your previous partner you weren't thinking about your current girlfriend. You never had even met her. It's the same for her. It's hard to imagine you with any other people now and the same goes for her, and you both shouldn't think about this anymore. You need to put the past in the past so your future with your new girlfriend can be strong. Good luck!|`|en734gIWaa	U SHOULDNT EVEN THINK ABOUT THE PAST... PUT IT BEHIND U... WHAT HAPPENED HAPPENED ND U CANT KEEP IT AGAINST HER!!!!! SHE FUKD UP ND THATS HER BAD BUT U SHOULD FEEL THE WAY U DO|`|sF8MaGsSaa	its normal to be hurt thats why its best to not share your past partners with your curent partner but if you love her you need to forgive and forget  everyone has a past|`|uiIrq19naa	YES YOUR WRONG THAT WAS HER PASS GET OVER IT AND IF YOU CANT GET OVER IT THEN YOU SHOULD NEVER BE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANYBODY

Institutional barriers were removed decades ago, but its going to take more than just a few generations to remove vestiges of centuries of oppression.  <br>  <br>  Of course demagouges like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton would never agree to that because they would lose face.  If there were ever any true biggots, its Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton. <br>   I would love to actually tell them to shut up! and instead preach something that could actually heal rather than divide.

Sinon, tu ne fais rien et il n'en saura jamais rien|`|4nINtrn2aa	O que oui c'est normal, tu es une ado qui découvre peu à peu ce que c'est que l'amour ou l'attirance physique...Le fait que tu t'intérese à un homme ne fait pas de toi une fille facile, c'est tout ce qui'il y a de plus logique...Maintenant, pour savoir comment tu dois te comporter, il n'y a pas de recette miracle, soit naturelle, reste comme tu es ... aborde le et après tu improvises ...<br>  bisous|`|UpgMKN5Saa	Althaay b'kraytek, akhtik mel houb. akray ya benti, akray....<br>  ou t'halay fi rouhek ou fi m'aaalik ou fi assatidatouk, ou fel dzayir<br>  yahya el jumhurya el jazairya el dimocratiya el cha3bya|`|d60d45d956745c55aa2b33fc764e416faa	Oui, c'est normal à 16 ans, on peut même tomber amoureux avant.<br>  <br>  Quant à la fa?on de te comporter, ?a dépend de tes envies et de la culture de ton pays. Les gens ici risquent de te répondre qu'il faut sortir avec ce gar?on, mais ce qui est bon en France ne l'est pas forcément ailleurs. Essaie de voir comment font tes copines.<br>  <br>  Pour finir, le fait d'aimer n'empêche pas de réussir des études, les deux peuvent être conciliées. Je dirais même que ?a donne un équilibre de vie. Trop d'amour est mauvais pour l'amour. Trop de travail est mauvais pour le travail.|`|uFpUQd7maa	tout à fait normalllltu peux lui déclarer ta flamme,,,rien de grave,,,,|`|224508c8d307bb88078fc18a861d853daa	Mais oui, c'est normal !!!

Si la situation te perturbes, avoues tes sentiment à ton amoureux et tu verras la réponse. ?a passe ou sa casse.|`|Ivwaj63zaa	Ne t'inquiète pas , c'est tout à fait normal à cet age là mais une chose à savoir , il faut se méfier des gar?ons en générale ! je suis algérienne comme toi et   tu sais bien comment notre société marche ma fille ! bon courage . <br>  en cas de besoin je serai là ! ok ?|`|Rx2IzBAJaa	Mais tu es tout à fait normale ma belle !!!<br>  Tu es adolescente, ton corps change et ta vision des hommes également. Ce sont les hormones qui te provoquent ce genre de sentiement. Les gar?ons avant tu les voyait comme des copains, maintenant tu commence à ressentir une attirance ... c'est normal. Ta sexualité est en train de commencer à se construire, tu sens de l'attirance pour quelqu'un, vous vous embrassez et lorsque le moment est venu vous envisagez d'aller plus loin. Je te conseil d'en parler avec tes amies, je suis certain que tes copines vivent la même chose.|`|TipmK48Oaa	il n'y pas d'age pour resentir des sentiments|`|U1uFYuo6aa	eh oui ma chère c'est bien de ton age et ?a s'appelle attirence ou l'amour!!dis lui simplement que tu l'aime..|`|71fccd1ab81190a26b326c1550b7b688aa	Moi je suis métisse algérienne et franco-belge et je comprend que tu as peur de tomber amoureuse de ce gar?on à cause de ta famille.<br>  <br>  Mais c'est tout à fait normal, et tu ne peux pas empêcher tes sentiments.<br>  <br>  Est ce que tu as des grandes soeurs(moi non)?Si oui peut être qu'elles sont avec un homme : mariées ou non?Est ce que tes parents t'interdisent de sortir avec un gar?on à ton age?Si tu as des grandes soeurs, regarde comment elles se comportent par rapport aux gar?ons et demande leur quoi faire.<br>  <br>  Je ne te dirai pas de sortir avec ce gar?on car c'est dangereux, mais tu ne peux pas non plus t'interdire de l'aimer!<br>  Dis toi que tu es bient?t majeure: plus que 2 ans, à 18 ans tu pourra faire ce que tu veux quitte à facher tes parents car tu sera adulte et selon la loi tu ne dépendra plus d'eux!<br>  <br>  Si à ce moment là tu ressens encore trop de pression, essaie de prendre ton indépendance : moi j'ai un travail en parallèle de mes études pour me payer mon propre appartement (même si moi mes parents acceptent mon copain: ma mère qui est belge totalement et mon père n'a pas le choix!), et je réussi quand même mes études!<br>  <br>  Pour l'instant il vaut mieux être patiente car tu es sensée encore obéir à tes parents (que tu sois algérienne ou pas, les fran?aises mineures c'est pareil), mais dans 2 ans quand tu sera majeure tu pourra décider toute seule de ta vie!|`|8aGxky6daa	si vous etes musulmane et lui musulman il ya aucun probleme aime quelqu'un mais il faut etre prudente de la relation entre les deux bon courage|`|RF7bGelkaa	c'est normal et je te demanderai d'agir en fonction de ton pays et ta religion parce que tu sais si ce quipeut arriver dans le cas contraire....elimination physique()|`|X7QFNOHCaa	c est tout à fait normal si tu l aime va le voir et explique lui ce que tu ressens ne le laisse pas partir avec une autre car tu le regretera un jour mais fait attention va doucement avec lui tu as tout ton temps|`|a3192b9220e9e65639d65796b2077e93aa	Arretes de faire l'innocente|`|rrA4yaXxaa	Il n'y a pas d'age pour l'amour. Le fait de se sentir attirer par quelqu'un du sexe opposé est un sentiment normal, qui n'enlève rien ni au sérieux d'une personne, ni à ses capacités de travail et son application dans ses études.<br>  <br>  Je pense qu'il faut que tu essayes de te rapprocher de lui, de lui parler pour voir au final s'il existe entre vous une amitié forte, ce qui est déjà beaucoup, ou bien si un amour peut na?tre entre vous deux, et s'il s'agit bien d'un sentiment partagé par les deux.<br>  <br>  Il est sans doute préférable de ne pas trop se précipiter mais de laisser le temps faire les choses, et d'accepter que les choses évoluent dans un sens : un plus grand rapprochement, ou un autre : un éloignement, sans pour autant se remettre en question et douter de soi.|`|xtRXCA0Naa	Oui c'est tout à fait normal, vers 15-16 ans les hormones se reveillent...alors s'il te plait tant que ca dis, lui tu verras bien ce que lui penses de toi...

Mais il faut savoir q'un homme au chomage est très sensible et vulnérable. Donc, fait-lui comprendre qu'il n'est pas obligé de faire le ménage mais qu'il t'apporte juste un coup de pouce. Apporte-lui ton soutien moral et financier au temps que tu peux.<br>  <br>  S'il ne veut rien comprendre, ne l'oblige pas à le faire.

Parceque c'est pas digne pour une femme que l'homme s'occupe des taches ménagères.|`|f954ff7847a0fab040eea1307191aa27aa	Moi aussi je suis d'accord avec toi.<br>  <br>  Qu'il t'aide un minimum cela serait bien et un maximum génial.<br>  <br>  Faut lui présenter la chose comme un partage de taches toi tu travailles àl'extérieur et lui devient donc le chef d'entreprise de la maison.<br>  <br>  Peut-être que c'est son éducation si sa mère faisait tout du coup pour lui c'est pas normal.<br>  <br>  En tout cas, ne pas lui rappeler qu'il est au ch?amge sans cesse et qu'il doit le faire sinon il risque de se braquer.<br>  <br>  Mais bon, il faut qu'il te ménage ;-p|`|ls9ynghLaa	vous changer de role au foyer ou koi<br>  car vous travailler et lui non!!!!!!!?????|`|pyNtq8oEaa	Je trouve ?a normal moi aussi.|`|vpVS5pqJaa	alice je suis parfaitement d'accord avec toi mais a condition que tu  n'oublie pas qu'il s'agit avant tout de ton époux c-a-dire tu doit le traiter de la bonne manière ?ar le coeur ne supporte pas ce qui le blesse. je souhaite du courage pour le supporter et un jour ca va passer|`|zriDe5dOaa	s'il refuse de preparer dis lui de chercher du travail, tu ne peux pas t'occuper de tout|`|MN2crhNZaa	tu as absolument raison|`|218cfa527bfbf4cd98093092fcd4bf4daa	Oui, tu as raison !<br>  Celui qui est à la maison s'occupe du ménage, des enfants et de la bouffe ! C'est un boulot à plein temps (quand on a des enfants).<br>  Sinon, il doit aller bosser et vous partagerez les taches.

C'est un grand fourre tout dans lequel on met les aspirations des gens à ressentir des choses agréables (et je ne parle pas de  l'amour filial et assimilés)...<br>  Une explosion hormonale, du désir, du plaisir, de la souffrance aussi, souvent, puis dans le meilleur des cas, quand le soufflé retombe, une grande et tendre complicité ou l'émotion des premiers temps  n'a plus sa place... <br>  Et tout ca n'a rien de triste en soi... ce qui est triste c'est quand les gens veulent se convaincre eux mêmes que ces sensations des débuts dureront toujours.<br>  <br>  alors non l'amour n'existe pas, mais ce que ce concept véhicule comporte souvent de bien jolies choses.|`|Iasxs5nKaa	oui mais il te faut le vivre inconditionnellement|`|llnbNVQuaa	si il y a une chose dont je suis sur c bien celle la seulement il faut un peu de chance pour tomber sur la bonne personne|`|tdikPKjBaa	heureusement oui mais;<br>  le parfait existe t-il oui mais tout est relatif à nos exigences,c'est comme les profondeurs d'un océan jusqu'où on peut et on a envie de plonger et surtout jusqu'où le partenaire peut plonger.l'important c'est de plonger ensemble de s'arrêter au limites du partenaire et puis l'accompagner plus profedement.Etre en harmonie sur la même longueur d'onde et continuer le chemin ensemble.<br>  Au début c'est le coup de foudre l'amour ,avec le temps c'est d'autres sensations c'est la complicité le plaisir de voir la vie pas avec deux yeux mais avec quatre ?a change tout et c'est de l'amour.Ensuite viennent les aléas de la vie les soucis,les problèmes les difficultés;les surmonter à deux c'est aussi de l'amour et chaque foie on sort plus fort et l'amour devient de plus en plus fort et intence.L'amour diffère et change selon les périodes et les situations mais c'est toujours de l'amour.<br>  Je confirme l'amour vrai existe mais reste intimement lié à ce qu'on donne et à ce qu'on exige .

OwtnHvL9aa	Pour moi amour veut dire commencer par s'aimer pour savoir aimer l'autre. Se faire confiance pour faire confiance à  l'autre. A partir de cette base on peut déployer cet amour à beaucoup d'autres personnes sous différentes formes. On peut aussi aimer les autres sans demander à recevoir en contre partie. L'amour désintéressé est sans doute le plus beau.|`|Kz5bAp5saa	Amour cela signifie que tu es pret(e) a donner des sentiments très fort à une personne...<br>  Aimer c'est donner ce que tu as de plus fort à une personne en particulié,Aimer une personne c'est lui donner la plus belle des chose au mond sa confiance...<br>  <br>  Je t'aime Amoureux<br>  <br>  Flori@ne|`|fcbyEBbfaa	Pour les être humains, Un véritable amour, c'est quand 2 êtres du sexes opposés, qui l'un retrouve dans l'autre sa moitié pour former un tandem, à la vie à la mort.<br>  hors de cela, c'est l'un qui profite de la crédulité pour faire l'amour.|`|Y34teTqIaa	Tout simplement follie, compiquer c'est vrai sa l'amour c'est gravement compliquer "je t'aime - moi pas trop presque enfin je sais ..." <br>  c'est chiant mais qu'est ce qu'on aime sa lol <br>  <br>  moi l'amour je le qualifiré comme sa et en même temps pur et fou parce que quand on est dans l'amour on fait tellment de bétise n'est ce pas ?

Pour se sentir mieux elle reproduit le schéma dans la situation inverse, elle n'est plus la victime mais l'instigatrice et pour soulager sa peine elle a besoin de cette sensation de force et d'avoir le contr?le sur sa vie et les personnes qui lui sont proches.<br>  <br>  Le rapport fille-père de même que celui du fils avec sa mère est particulier... c'est un lien d'amour oedipien... je suis une femme et l'homme de notre vie, notre premier amour, et l'homme qu'on aime en premier c'est notre père... notre vie future dépend ensuite de la relation qui s'est établie, de cet amour... elle te rends sans doute responsable de son échec amoureux car tu es bien évidemment un homme mais surtout par cette attitude je pense qu'elle te demande de l'aide. Ne te vexe pas avec elle et ne la braque pas... laisse-là un peu digérer et va la voir et lui parler... elle vient d'être blessée par un gar?on et je pense qu'elle a besoin du réconfort d'un homme, un homme qu'elle aime, son papa... rassure-la et parle-lui en tant que papa et en tant qu'homme, que les gar?ons à cet age-là sont bêtes.<br>  <br>  Surtout ne minimise pas sa peine en lui disant que c'est pas grave que ?a lui passera et qu'elle en trouvera un autre (même si c'est vrai et que nous, en tant qu'adulte on sait que ?a passe) car les ados n'intègrent pas cela et ?a les braque car ?a veut dire qu'au fond on n'attache pas d'importance à leur vie, à leurs problèmes et à leur peine...<br>  <br>  Parle-lui de ton expérience à son age quand tu étais un ado... si tu as vécu un chagrin d'amour à cet age-là parle-lui en elle se sentira comprise et soutenue et ce sera un grand pas. Dis-lui que si elle veut parler que tu es là et que tu as de la peine de la voir comme ?a... laisse-lui un peu d'intimité et dis-lui que tout le monde a des chagrins d'amour et que c'est son premier et que ?a fait d'elle une femme.<br>  <br>  Bon courage et donne des nouvelles...|`|Izq9qR6naa	Elle commence t?t dis donc ! si c'est la crise d'ados je te souhaite plein de courage .

Dans mon profil tu trouveras dans mes contacts Malou41, écris lui et demande lui des conseils car elle a réussi à me supporter la pauvre, elle te donnera ses secrets.Tout ce que moi je peux te dire, c'est sois patiente, ne t'emporte pas, c'est un mauvais moment à passer. Ne cherche pas à ce qu'elle te confie quoi que ce sit, ce n'est plus le moment. Mais écris à ma maman, elle saura te dire.|`|qyZiH9Rxaa	il faut poser des limites les insultes ne sont pas acceptables, vous n'êtes pas responsable de ses chagrins, peut-être pourrez-vous même l'aider à les dépasser si elle change d'attitude|`|y113MSnZaa	à 12 ans déjà ?  de qui s'agissait il ?  ton petit ami ?|`|4uX5dXoxaa	C'est normal et ?a passera, il faut seulement un peu de temps.

Mais un conseil, ne la laisse pas faire.|`|YKYbfH60aa	Il est difficile à 12 ans de sa sentir rejeter le corps change et les mentalités aussi.<br>  il est normal qu'elle vous rejette car elle doit faire le deuil de votre exemple afin d'exister par elle meme ( complexe d'Oedipe) : c'est l'age pour une fille qui se sent evoluer de mettre un terme à sa relation mére-fille : c'est à vous de faire évoluer vos relations et de la laisser exister, de la laisser prendre ses décisions et en affronter les conséquences (adaptées à son age)...<br>  Elle a certainement vécu son premier amour d'ado. et malheureusement c'est fini...A vous de lui faire comprendre que vous etes là si elle en a besoin et que vous serez toujours là..Vous devez lui faire comprendre que cette rupture fait partie de la vie et qu'elle sera à nouveau heureuse quand elle sera prete à ouvrir son coeur..<br>  Elle est jeune, elle doit comprendre que la vie n'est pas rose et que malheureusement ce n'est plus une petite princesse mais une jeune fille : cette rupture l'aidera à grandir quand elle l'aura digérée.Il faut lui laisser du temps quand elle sera prete à vous parler , elle viendra d'elle meme.<br>  EN GROS, lachez du leste elle doit apprendre à grandir par elle meme : elle n'es plus votre petite fille mais une jeune fille qui découvre que la vie n'est pas rose !!Faites lui comprendre que losrqu'elle sera prete vous serez là pour l'écouter sans la juger: l n'y a rien de pire pour une ado que  d'etre jugée par ses parents et encore plus sa mére...<br>  BON COURAGE!!!!|`|j5szwPmzaa	Déjà, elle en veut... aux hommes bien s?r !!! Alors, en plus vous êtes le "pater familias" (dit père de famille). Elle en veut à la terre entière, c'est normal. 12 ans, c'est encore très jeune, il faut qu'elle se forge un caractère. Elle apprendra, et ?a cicatrisera !!! Bon courage!|`|p5mPOXhSaa	j'ai 15 ans et j'ai vécu cet expérience mes parents n'ont pas compris mon état il m'avons ignorer parce qu'il ne sont pas compréhensibles nous sommes maintenant à l'age de l'adolescence qui demande la tendresse l'amour si non va être obligé de chercher l'amour en dehors de notre maison alors je te conseille de parler avec elle comme un ami à son age asseyes de parler avec son ex asseyes de trouver une solution pour l'aider parce que c'est difficile à oublier sans aide je te conseille de l'aider de lui donner tous ton amour pour elle sort de son insolence

He didn't hug you because he probably thought it would be awkward. You should ask him out and if he says no who cares it's his loss! If he says yes, party!!|`|CJiJV0v9aa	two things he can be shyyy because he really likes you or shy because he doesnt orrr one of his friends really likes you and he feels weird getting in the way ya knowww bros before hoes lol|`|26fc99962fa10b567d812494e6655c58aa	   u pretty much answered it urself, he doesnt giv u eye contact because hes shy, he probably doesnt want to say anything stupid in front of or at you.<br>     hes not trying to purposefully be mean or rude to you, thats just part of his personality. Trust me, if a guy is always staring at you, then 95% of the time its because we're interested.<br>     You should probably talk to some of his friends to get a wider perspective, find out some his interests so you can actually start a conversation with him.<br>  <br>  Good luck |`|6QQU6IMRaa	From this, I would say he likes you.  Sometimes when guys don't know what to do they're dicks.  Or he likes you but doesn't want anyone to know.
wc567ZgUaa	GET A NEW MAN. HE MUST NOT WANT TO BE WITH YOU BECAUSE HE IS IN LOVE SOMEONE ELSE. HE IS NOT WORTH YOUR TEARS.|`|Kamucfmtaa	If you can wait a little ? So PLS wait and after it will be funny for you that you wanted him back And belive to this wordes SO I HAVE DONE --- If you Love Him , Let Him GO!|`|ON4iGx0paa	you should buy yourself a dictionary and learn how to spell properly..|`|mwv5A3HFaa	U can't make someone love you...believe me, the intense pain you feel WILL fade.  You have to dust yourself off and get back out there.  Don't go LOOKING for a new guy, just start doing things you enjoy like skating, taking walks, going to the movies, take a new class (cooking, language, computer or whatever interests you.)  Before you know it, time will have healed your broken heart, and someone else will eventually come along...just be careful not to jump headfirst into another heartbreak out of desperation.  Hugs and good luck..
S6qKxGKMaa	you should go ahead and send the halloween box but you might want to add a letter asking him about his behavior and lack of communication. you know that he's changed somehow and still care for him but need to feel that your not waisting your time on someone who doesn't appreciate it. <br>  you need to be straight with him, you can not quit talking and expect someone to figure things out, if he is trying to distance himself from you then he is hoping you'll just 'go away' you need to confront him about it and be sure of his intentions so your not left stressing.|`|lLEP9nsFaa	I wouldn't.. see if he brings it up- sounds like he's done with the thought of you two and just doesnt want to say it "out loud"|`|zg1i6UkPaa	you should hes going through some hard times and hes probably feeling guilty for all this stuff and plus the military is hard and depressing. i think maybe the worst thing you could do right now is leave him he needs a friend. |`|gyl9nwNoaa	send him it. just b a good friend but not to close cuz he might break your heart. b there for him though|`|5iLLrTyCaa	well u can always send it and just consider yourself being a good friend.  He will appreciate that you are still thinking of him enough to take the time to do that.  They need our support over there.  My husband is getting ready for his second deployment and I know he was always happy to recieve anything thru the mail, even though we could email.|`|lmao5hCmaa	Go ahead and send the Halloween package.<br>  <br>  You made it for him, and it is a good way to let him know that you're thinking of him.  If you choose not to make any more in the future, that's okay as well.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that men don't always do things for the most intelligent reasons.  There are myriad reasons he can use to try and justify not responding as much as you would like - not many are valid IMO, but that doesn't mean that he doesn't see them as such.<br>  <br>  One more thing - care packages tend to get shared (at least the more general portions that aren't meant exclusively for him) - so you're not just helping keep his morale up.<br>  <br>  Sending packages on each holiday (even the 'minor' ones) doesn't make you seem desperate - it shows that you thought of him.  Sending demanding, pleading, complaining letters repeated would. (I'm not implying that you do, only giving an example.)<br>  <br>  If you have spoken of marriage before, then you should be able to politely and calmly discuss your feelings and concerns now.  Relationships require good communication.  You appear to have a good relationship with his mother as well; perhaps you could talk to her about your concerns - instead of inquiring about his ex, try expressing what you're feeling and why you are concerned.<br>  <br>  One last thing - deployments cause stress that has no match stateside.  Everyone deals with that stress in a different way - some cling, some distance themselves, many find other ways to cope.  If you do decide to continue having a relationship, one of the best things you can do is step back and figure out 1) how you deal with the stress of his deployments and 2) talk to him and his close relatives / friends / coworkers to learn and understand how he deals with it.<br>  <br>  Case in point - when I would come home, I would occasionally need to take a shower & reorder my thoughts before spending time with my girlfriend (now wife) that I was living with.  She understood this, would greet me at the door and then leave me be while I took my shower.  We had many fewer arguments once we had sat down and talked about it.<br>  <br>  Originally, she would get upset and hurt since she perceived me as ignoring her, while I needed the time to collect my thoughts and shift the way I respond to people - which she would have found hurtful as well, if I had treated her in the same manner as I would at work.<br>  <br>  Bottom line - Communication & Honesty.<br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  Just saw your 'additional details'.<br>  <br>  If you see him as selfish now, don't ever think that it will change in the future.  People can change, but they have to want to - and their underlying personality traits very rarely change.  If he's consistently selfish now, don't think for a moment that he'll start putting you first later.
OCQS1woFaa	So you were like 13 when you met this guy, and he was 18??  That's just straight up gross.  This is a horrible idea and doomed to failure.
8zwUmM48aa	not really. different people have different preferences! whatever floats your boat or puffs up your dress! and i'm sure you'll have no problem finding a girlfriend.... most girls don't like doing oral|`|E3O2Gi0Uaa	Everyone has their thing that they don't like. I personally love it...best thing since sliced bread.|`|TlU3zj61aa	My boyfriend doesn't like it either. I, as a girl, don't mind giving it but he refuses so oh well...I just have to find other ways to please him.|`|j5LBlIAKaa	i am the exact same it grosses me out too|`|bu6BhCnpaa	not weird...I'm betting you would like the feeling of the act if you did not find it so degrading or uncomfortable...<br>  <br>  i don't like giving it...but i do it because i care deeply for my bf...and i know he enjoys it and it makes him happy.<br>  <br>  i don't necessarily like getting oral...but my bf also finds that sexy...and it does feel good.<br>  <br>  i figure if he finds it sexy, i can get over the discomfort...<br>  <br>  that being said...i could live forever without it...and i also lose respect for guys that expect it but won't give it...<br>  <br>  so if you dont want to do it or give it...you can most liekly fid girls that are on your playing field...no worries...|`|wknx9Oswaa	I don't really like it myself don't be too closed minded in giving it to  your girl. Girls need to have a lot more stimulation before they can come so it's best if you can give her/them an oral first before drilling it in. But you know once you get comfortable with your partner, it's nice to try it. If your uncomfortable at first just let go and enjoy it. It will help if you can both take a bath first before doing the act so you'll feel clean while doing it.  |`|8Lt2CDJ9aa	to each his own. Sometimes when girls perform oral sex on me i feel guilty about it. a few times ive even had to stop them. but i don't think its a terrible thing to do. i love to perform oral on my partners. i think its sexy to be able to show love thru oral. its just another way to please somebody. as long as youre clean its not very gross. |`|Qy4k1w1aaa	I don't know how many other guys feel that way, but as a woman who is not fond of giving head I think it'd be a pleasant change to have a guy who wasn't acting like the only thing that mattered was having me go down on him. So many guys focus on that over anything else.|`|GV5Cmdotaa	I don't think it's weird. Everybody has different tastes. Quite a few women would love a guy who doesn't like oral sex, because like you said, they only do it because they feel they need to "please" their man. I don't like giving head and I wish more men didn't care so much about it.|`|fKLchWRYaa	I don't think it's weird, I think its nice that you wouldnt want your woman to be degraded like that<br>  <br>  however, if you actualy recieved oral sex you'd be preaching a different tune, and you should give it a chance if the girl has no problem doing it.|`|aYFQaQyUaa	you are your own person. its who you are and what you do/do not like.<br>  its not weird-- it maybe different-- but not "weird".|`|0ZRMeSUCaa	no, ur taste is you're taste. but some girls like receiving it.|`|cDBexBNPaa	not at all. i completely agree with you.

gPq5QJsmaa	Hahahahaha..funny question<br>  <br>  nah i dont think you're hopelessly attracted to younger women; however if you went for a 22 yr old, then that would be gross. but hey if she went for you too, then who cares rite? <br>  <br>  nah you wouldnt get slapped if you tried to get in her pants..my question is, would you be still going at that age? lol..wouldnt you get tired after like two seconds? haha|`|5db14b93b6f8b7df5274c10511ae863baa	at that age, no one really cares.<br>  <br>  and if you could even work your hand into those granny panties, it's doubtful she would have the spunk to hit you. and in fact may like it, due to the absence of it.|`|61510db246a5bc468f5833a18e304ca3aa	lets see your not 103 and she is not 99|`|AA11001110	Cradle robber!

As for the slap, you'd probably get in her pants, it depends on how kinky a horny 99-year-old woman is.

d5b86058ef29b4fefd94f86404e82679aa	Long distance relashinships work if you put a LOT of time and effort into them.  It takes effort on both parts.  If you love each other and have been talking for suchj a long time why hasn't she given you her phone number and address?  I do not mean to get you down but as a woman myself that shows that she may not trust you and that means she can't be in love with you.  You two need to start talking on the phone and yes maybe meeting in person but if she will not even give you her phone number than I would not go to see her yet she obviousley is not ready and you must know that if your haveing doughts.|`|9a53cfe0528691a7b2b620178a4e23ceaa	alright first of all LONG DISTANT RELATIONSHIPS NEVER ***** LAST AND THEY PISS ME OFF...HAVE U EVEN MET HER?...this is retarded...u guys wont last......sry if it hurts but its the truth

It's fine to say "oh it doesn't mean anything" but let's be honest....  by commenting to her, he was looking for her attention.  He could have thought it and kept it to himself but no, he is looking for a response and hoping to start something.  The XXX would lead me think that the something he wants to start has a lot to do with the something in his pants.|`|YtdRTjkNaa	dont sweat it. that one thing you dont want to do is run him away because you excused him a flirting through a comment . especially like that. now if the comment said something like " i would kiss that any day" something like that is not right. but you just have to trust and remember what's done in the dark will come to the light.|`|zQiYKgMLaa	just remember why you like him and be affectionate towards him.  There's really nothing wrong at all with what he did.  I think you're just overreacting.  Make him know why he's got the best girl and you'll have nothing to worry about.|`|1ZlaWGSSaa	its just a comment to someone, nothing to worry about, and don't start getting into the jealousy thing its not fair to him and not good in a relationship|`|2cgHNeRZaa	You've got nothing to worry about, trust me. Unless the girl in the picture was wearing super-slutty clothes or something, I really doubt there's a problem. No one likes a paranoid girlfriend :P|`|VHaALgaXaa	wow thats like the start of terrorism! :/|`|9aEKDhETaa	Ya, he's definitely cheating on you. Put a strand of you hair in his apple pie and everything will go back to normal. :)|`|4MMoLUNLaa	lol.. why would you get mad at this again and why would you wonder why he said that if the d00d is with you|`|XECxpYIQaa	It's okay, he was just being nice.

If a guy don't like you for who you really are then no matter what you do, he still won't like YOU.. Even if you dress, act, and talk like you think they what you to.. And the boys seem to like you,, It's still not YOU they like,  it's  who your pretending to be.. and then it's not real,, Be true to who you really are and if they can't accept you for that then your better off..

Of course!  Being in anything that even approaches a healthy relationship you MUST speak your mind and you must discuss, communicate, share, express, talk, feel free to tell your partner you disapprove of how he treats you or what he is doing, how things make you feel, what you expect, you've got to command if not demand respect as well as be willing to return it to him as well!  If you can't or won't or don't feel able or FREE to do this - this relationship is unhealthy, unhappy, scarey and possibly he is a control freak or you are an abuse victim waiting to happen!  Be smart here - this is NOT small deal in my opinion!  No one deserves to be disrespected, belittled, demeaned or spoken down to like this - get help, get a spine or get out!

c2649446adabbc95d79faefb021cb19eaa	Personality and, at least for me, his eyes.  His body matters some but not too much.  There's something special about a person's eyes, and it can tell you a lot about who that person is.  For me when I first look into a guy's eyes (first impressions generally) I will usually be able to tell right away if I'm attracted to him or not.  I can't explain exactly why that happens, but it's been said that the eyes are a window to the soul.  So maybe it has to do with being able to get a feel for compatibility with that first glimpse of who a person is.  But then again, maybe not since I'm pretty biased towards guys with dark eyes ;)  Hmmm and for that matter, dark hair and a deep voice...|`|98a2f5323f0329e56c6ab31c03cfb5e6aa	the way he looks at me and smiles, the way he gently touches my cheek before leaning in and kisses me. the way he smells. the way he whispers in my ear then nibbles his way down my neck ;)|`|c8a3e9dfb09ecbc5989dbc8cc405f056aa	Super HOT bodies and the eyes and the personality I like funny not to sensitive (they take everything to personally) but kinda like me.......|`|AA11832876	Personality and his eye's|`|AA10164807	Great attitudes and wonderful overall personality.

La réalité c'est que pour connaitre les "actions parfois si...." d'un bipo sur ses enfants, tu sais bien que ce ne sera jamais équilibré, chaleureux et bienveillant pour cet enfant, mais que le lui "enlever" c'est lui enlever une raison importante de se lever le matin et de s'obliger à...<br>  Etant sa soeur la DDASS semble difficile, mais il y a je ne vais pas te l'apprendre les CMPP, les assistantes sociales...

Tu sais bien qu'elle n'a pas conscience de son état, de ses prises de risque, et qu'entre idéalisation et clivage, tout est hyper complexe, tout prend des proportions... et pour eux, dans leur part de manipulation narcissique inconsciente, ils réussissent toujours à être au centre de tout... Il sont dans la déni total et ne supportent pas d'être ramenés à leurs responsabilités et sont incapable de nuance, d'objectivité et d'empathie... Ca fait beaucoup de points "négatifs" pour étblir une communication, qui avec eux, je le dis avec tendresse, est toujours : paradoxale.

8d21e23c5cf0fd4c0ec305e4c0581838aa	Pour répondre à ta première question...<br>  Pourquoi rester fidèle ?<br>  Parce que c'est la plus belle preuve d'amour que l'on puisse donner à l'élu(e) de son coeur ! Les sollicitations et tentations diverses sont présentes dans la vie de chacun d'entre-nous... Mais y rester "imperméable" c'est dire à l'autre : "tu vois... mon coeur continue à ne voir que toi" !<br>  En même temps, la vie m'a enseigné que rien, n'était jamais acquis ! L'amour est, certes, la plus belle roseraie du monde... Mais comme tous les rosiers, encore faut-il arriver à le nourrir au printemps, à l'entretenir en été et à le protéger en hiver....<br>  <br>  Pour répondre à ta deuxième question.<br>  Comment rester fidèle ?<br>  En brandissant le panneau "Gare aux décharges de chevrotines... Terrain de chasse privé" !!!    :-):-):-)<br>  <br>  Pour répondre à ta troisième question.<br>  Comment et pourquoi rester fidèle à ses valeurs et principes ?<br>  On doit rester fidèle à nos valeurs car elles représentent le fil rouge ou la ligne verte, de tout ce que qui fait que nous sommes nous... C'est en quelque sorte, notre "colonne vertébrale morale"... Si l'on s'en éloigne de trop... On risque de se perdre en chemin !<br>  <br>  Quant aux principes j'ai appris à mes dépends, qu'ils n'étaient pas immuables dans le temps... Ils évoluent en fonction des expériences de Vie de chacun...<br>  <br>  Bisous...

92784b46bd958aceb50aeff60a4f90deaa	Yes... some people can't handle certain age differences. It isn't unique among women and it isn't unique to the man being older. Couples get strange reactions to a 45 year old woman dating a 30 year-old man also.<br>  <br>  However, the woman you dated does have a reason to be furious. It isn't that you want a younger woman, it is that you bothered to date her in the first place knowing full well that you wanted a younger woman. She wasn't 33 when you met her and she didn't magically age overnight. When you met, you should have said , "No thank you" and not wasted her time. <br>  <br>  Wouldn't you be furious if some woman dated you and then said, "I want a tall man, a Chinese guy, or someone with hazel eyes." Of course you'd be mad because she knew that you weren't any of these when you first met. No reason to waste your time.<br>  <br>  Finally, it isn't wise to say you want someone younger, since that isn't exactly true. If you want certain things which often come with youth, then say you want specific things. It is far better to say "I want a more energetic sex partner", "I want to have children", "I want someone still striving for goals", etc. rather than just make age itself seem like the reason. Presumably, you could run into a 41 year-old who has these traits and a 29 year old who doesn't.<br>  <br>  If there are specific traits which you are looking for, then it is fine to target your dating towards groups more likely to have those traits. However, it is shallow to assume that only folks in those groups have such traits. It is also generally stupid to date people you know don't have those traits without a big proviso up front.|`|9hpR4BG5aa	maybe becasue they are jealous, and could be mad that you don't see much in them? or maybe they just want you cuz your sexy or something lol IDK and totally rude to tell a girl that shes to old for you! How you you likeit if a 22 year old girl told you that your balls were to old for her? you wouldn't like that lol but maybe you should just lie to a girl if she's to old for you|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Older ladies take things like this to heart.  They tend to think they aren't pretty any more or that no one will have them.  Personally I kind of like the older women.  They have taught me a lot in my younger days.  I once even dated a woman that was 18 years older than I was and it was fantastic.  Older women seem to like a man that's experienced but the also like guys they can mold.<br>  <br>  Don't ever use that line that someone is too old for you, it's not a nice way to put it.  There are better ways to put it.  I once dated a girl half my age and it was great for almost two years but she was easily sexually distracted and had an affair with her older boss.  I can't share when I'm with someone.  I'm not a jealous person until they give me a reason to be jealous, unfortunately it's usually too late by that point.<br>  <br>  Just watch what you say to women, they take things the wrong way almost every time and there's no reason to make an enemy for such a small thing.|`|MjkDTovqaa	Yeah go on ahead and do what you will, eventually every woman will be that age and as long as they don't feel the same way you do grandpa then it's cool right?|`|Xtqq71KGaa	you have a right to like what you like.  i wouldn't want to be with someone who looks at me like an old vacuum bag anyway.  besides, wait till your karma catches up with you.|`|IMVEv4dqaa	Wow. Get over yourself.|`|TgU9P6pdaa	Women don't like to hear that because they want to feel like they get more beautiful WITH age.   You think that your skin is great and you're the best lover?  What happens when the 31 year old wants kids?  If you have kids with her, then will you dump her because the sex is bad?  Dating someone closer to your age ensures that the relationship is going in the same direction. Obviously you care more about sex though|`|qi7PzTGbaa	Just put yourself in her shoes. When you're a woman and in your 40s, its sometimes hard for some people to accept. But to hear someone say that you're too old, that kind of hurts. Its ok to keep it real, but have their feelings into consideration.|`|pORmp0tfaa	stop subjecting younger women to your old washed up self. |`|7Icg8uKraa	Well, one day someone will come up to you and be like... Wow your the same age as my parents! you are way to old for me daddyo!.<br>  Next time break up with a girl when it has to do with her, not her age. <br>  Of course everyone gets old eventually, but that gives you no right to tell other women that they are too old for you when you are in fact just as old.|`|AA11339023	There is NO harm in your personal choice. but, I do have to say, your choice does label you as " shallow". <br>  <br>  You are not saying anything about personality, compatibility, or feelings. You are only interested, from what you say, in " looks" and sex.<br>  <br>  As an older woman, I can only say...who cares? After listening to my daughter's input on this, they would say, a young woman that is into older men, are not after feelings, compatability, or personality either; they want his MONEY. <br>  <br>  So, you both get what you want... works for us!|`|HaoJgyv0aa	I'm 21. and i must say, i HATE when old men hit on me, like seriously, it's gross, your like my dads age. Actually, my DAD is younger than YOU! I went out with an older guy once, and more than likely, when a younger woman does, they are using you for your money, just like your using them for their youthful look. You need to grow up. Maybe your going through a mid life crises. Why do older women hate it? It's because men like you, that make women fear the aging process, because when they hit forty they feel like they are no longer desirable. Thats really sad. If you had a 23 year old daughter, how would you feel if someone your age was hitting on her? GROSS!|`|VsRRQbp6aa	women are obsessed with age and looks. If men our own age dont want us how do you think that makes us feel?<br>  We all want our youth back, and to be perky and young. It is totally up to you if you gan get a youngun to like you then bloody good going<br>  But remember your young something may want a young something in a few years when it may be too late for you to get someone else who can laugh with you, not at you, when you talk about the beatles|`|WR4cYLd4aa	Nothing. The only thing you have to realize is that 30-something women will someday be 40-something, and then their skin will change just like any other woman's and what will you do then?<br>  <br>  Unless you are rich, not many 30 year old women are going to date a 60 year old man. You might have problems if you keep trying to trade in for a newer model.

If he doesn't bother returning your calls, won't tell you when he is back in town, and expects you to make the effort to meet up with him at his every whim, he is just using you! Don't call him back, and if you do hear from him again, tell him your schedule is so booked you don't have the time for someone who doesn't make time for you.

Mais voyez-vous, c'est dur quand on a toujours été célibataire, justement parce que on n'a pas trouvé une femme qui nous a "véritablement" intéressée... Non pas un coup de foudre, ni une aventure d'un soir, juste une vrai dame pour la vie. <br>  <br>  Dans le cadre de mon travail, j'ai rencontré une personne très bien, mais déjà accompagnée. Au fil du temps, on s'est apprivoisé mais je suis resté h?nnête avec mes principes et avec elle, ne voulant pas que ?a aille trop loin (elle avait déjà un copain). Malgré ses diverses sollicitations, j'ai eu le courage (faut le dire) de les rejeter. <br>  <br>  Puis un soir, "à l'insu de mon plein gré", on s'est retrouvé chez moi. Tout s'est tellement bien passé... Au final, je crois que tous les deux étions fiers et heureux de ne pas l'avoir fait.<br>  <br>  Quand je la croise aujourd'hui avec son ami, sincèrement, je souhaite qu'il reste longtemps ensemble. Bien s?r que je regrette le soir en question, parce que son ami a appris qu'on a fr?lé l'irréparable. De plus,  je n'ai pas respecter à 100% mon principe sur la fidélité absolue. Je souhaite ne plus jamais me retrouver dans une situation aussi délicate...<br>  <br>  Je suis heureux car malgré la tentation de la chair, même étant célibataire, j'ai su et pu résister. Cette expérience aura malgré tout raffermi mes convictions et m'aura donné une image encore plus belle de ce qu'est vraiment l'amour... Ce n'est pas que le plaisir de la chair, mais aussi et surtout un état d'esprit qui devra toujours nous empêcher de trahir la confiance de l'être a?mé.<br>  <br>  Donc je vous souhaite à tous beaucoup de courage et de faire de votre mieux, en évitant les pièges de la vie, afin de ne devenir ni l'amant, ni la ma?tresse!?!?|`|B7sG8UP7aa	Non, 100% contre l'infidelité!|`|JOlv64q8aa	oui, je ne suis pas contre l'infidélité|`|N1wutKHZaa	J'ai une maitresse , mais que dans mon esprit|`|OZ1IpIXiaa	jsui contre mais g deja ete la maitresse d'un homme marier , en general sa fini tjrs par rester avec sa femme, car une relation com sa n'etai une vrai relation a ces yx... vous ne pouvez pas tout faire ensemble il a des obligation exterieur ... femme enfant etc... sa vie c son premier foyer ski passe dans sa vie , comme une relation extra conjugale ne resister jamais bien longtps|`|RCtrK5mkaa	je l'ai envoyé ballader;<br>  il me jette un jour à la figure"chérie ma femme est revenue mais ne t'en fais pas, on continuera à se voir"<br>  alors je lui dit "donc,tu étais marié?va te faire........|`|TViYMOdIaa	oui et non car rien ne sait vraiment passer, ca a été un coup de foudre. Mais le fait qu'ils soit marier et même si pas très heureux dans sont couple, j'ai préféré ne pas poursuivre cette relation.

Je le suis en ce moment... (donc je ne sais pas comment ?a va se finir ! LOL) Je suis contre l'infidélité mais dans mon sens.  C'est à dire que je ne pourrais pas tromper mon partenaire, mais être avec un homme marié ne me dérange pas. Si c'est son choix c'est qu'il n'est pas heureux dans son couple. Bien s?r pendant un certain temps hein !! Pas sur du long terme... Si je peux être un peu heureuse c'est ce qui m'importe. Je sais c'est pas joli-joli...

5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	I find it really hard to give anything like a good answer to your question - but I'm gonna give it a try.<br>  You have been seeing one another for quite some time, and I feel sure that you have very strong feelings for one another. Many people, even given your own ages, would have taken things further before now.<br>  There is still the risk, no matter how small, that he could find himself in quite serious trouble, and I know you would never want that.<br>  If you are, nonetheless, going to "take it to the next level", be absolutely sure that you are fully prepared for the eventuality well beforehand, which means ensuring that you have (minimally) condoms with you. For goodness sake do NOT take the slightest risk of pregnancy or STDs (no matter how confident you are that he isn't infected with or carrying anything).<br>  You are 15. Is it out of the question to wait a little longer until you are, at least legally, of the age where "trouble" (at least with the law - let's not even go anywhere near what kind of difficulties might arise if your parents find out) will not be too worrying?<br>  If the situation arises, and you feel 100% comfortable about it, I imagine it will happen. <br>  If it does, then I hope that you find it a good experience, with no reason whatever for regret, but you do need to realise that many young people's first few experiences of sex are far from the wonderful thing that they were hoping for, and that regret often does follow.<br>  You're in a difficult place. I wish I could offer some sort of positive advice, but I can't because I think you should wait even longer!!<br>  I can only hope that you take all the time in the world to be sure it is the right thing for yourself. Your boyfriend's feelings really should not come into it unless you are absolutely sure it is right for you, and that you are taking all the time it needs to take care of yourself.<br>  Best of luck.|`|X1uFQvZ9aa	Girl i gotta tell you a story, im 16 years old. My first time was with my then boyfriend who was 16 and i was 15, i'll leave out the details but long story short we used a condom and three months later i found out was pregnant ( that was the only time i have ever had sex so i knew he was the dad) but for reason other then the sex we had broken up before i found out that i was pregnant and i told him that i was pregnant and  he was shocked at first then wanted to help me. <br>  <br>  Well anyway i had the baby and kept her she looks just like her daddy. She is still in the hospitle because she was born premature<br>  <br>  <br>  DONT ruin your life by having sex with a 18 year old at 15!! you could get pregnant, he could be charged for rape, you could get an std...... Dont make the mestake that i did.|`|sPUOcQ21aa	i think that you should talk about it with him. this isnt something that should be taken lightly. i think that you should understand that your gonna give him all of yourself not just your mouth. it really shouldnt just be like i wanna do it. if he respects you and understands that you really want to this than thats good. but think if he just jumps in to it then wait and think what is his real motive? if he really loves you then he'll ask before you do it if you are really sure? if he does then he respects you if he doeesnt and your not sure then you know wat he really wants.|`|WEiN4TJIaa	Don't be so quick to lose your virginity. You are FIFTEEN years old! You're still a kid! Why is an 18 year old with a 15 year old? Just because you are bombarded with sex every time you turn on the television doesn't mean that you should do the same.|`|AA11607270	Maybe he does not want to go to jail. Try googling your situation and you will find a lot of young men punished by the law for dating a girl a few years younger than them.|`|TwRe0hq0aa	just tell him i think im ready to give it up to you|`|zj8HLXI3aa	Good day Unique,<br>  Y'know, in my opinion, you two just shouldn't have sex. If your relationship is fine already, sex really won't make it much better. It also has a big possibility of making it way, way worse. My recommendation is that you hold off for longer. If he's not pushing it, I wouldn't push it if I were you. <br>  Here's a link about the legal aspects of your situation;<br>  <a href="http://www.livestrong.com/article/12483-age-consensual-sex/" rel="nofollow">http://www.livestrong.com/article/12483-...</a><br>  And even if you consent, if your parents find out they can press charges against him. I knew some guy that got sent away for a year because of it, and has a felony on his record for the rest of his life. Simply not worth the risk. <br>  Just my opinion, however, as you are young and free to do as you please.<br>  Mini
5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	No, it wouldn't be rude.<br>  Will you be studying the same poems?<br>  It's research, and, as such, is an essential tool for learning!<br>  Go for it!|`|8ReUKb7Baa	The best you can do with this, is ask your friend to come over<br>  or leave her notes for you to have a read to  see if there is an <br>  angle you have not thought of , it could be of help to you and to<br>  how you might improve your own work.<br>  Or on the other hand it may not be of any help at all, but you need<br>  to really devote some time to reading them, more time with your own<br>  studies and homework for better results.<br>  <br>  I don't think photocopying would be a good idea, even if she is at<br>  a different school, this is plagiarism...... um it can later lead to all<br>  sorts of problems , even between parents  and so forth.<br>  You need to believe in yourself and spend more time on your work.|`|KI9TOARyaa	Dude if she's your friend, it's not rude. <br>  <br>  You just need a little help, and she has it.<br>  <br>  I get what you mean by rude though, so if you don't feel comfortable or you don't know her well enough then don't ask her.<br>  <br>  Good Luck....|`|zYD30zyyaa	You could ask her for help first and ask if u could read her notes and explain why.<br>  Or you could search online...sup wit poems? all u need is the S.P.E.C.S and S.L.I.M.S! lol...|`|sPUOcQ21aa	no i dont think it would be rude i would probably do the some thing. not like she needs them nymore anyways. i see no hfarm in asking. and shes your friend so i dont think it should bother her just dont plagerize her. j/k.

AA11851137	You need to do challenging things for yourself.  Run a 5K race, learn to paint, cook, shoot a gun, take classes in public speaking, whatever.  Do something you've never done before.  It will build your confidence and that will show on the outside, trust me.  Everytime you make a mistake, you'll have yourself to correct it.  You will become more and more dependent on yourself, and you will feel like you can handle anything- which eliminates worrying and those negative, damaging thoughts.|`|8688b2148fa405bcf4da9aae94282a22aa	Physical exercise !

Les porte-jartelles, c’est vieux comme le monde, mais ?a marche toujours aussi bien ! (à condition aussi que ce soit discret !)<br>  <br>  2/ Le?on de jardinage :<br>  Apprenez à débroussailler sans pour autant pousser jusqu’à la totale !!! Variez la forme de ton buisson, du "ticket de métro" au minou en forme de c?ur…tu vas lui faire perdre la tête.<br>  <br>  3/ L’effeuillage…<br>  Le strip-tease est un art qui n’est pas toujours ma?trisé. Apprends à te déshabiller de manière sexy. Sinon, si tu vois que ton mec galère à dégrafer ton soutif’, file lui un coup de main en l’enlevant toi-même avant qu’il s’énerve !!! <br>  <br>  4/ Alors, ?a tétonne ?<br>  Les tétons de ton copain sont aussi sensibles que les tiens. Embrasse-les, lèche-les…?a fait partie des préliminaires!!!<br>  <br>  5/ A l’heure de l’apéro, sortez les gla?ons !!! <br>  Sucer…des gla?ons avant de passer au gar?on !!! La sensation de froid est électrisante…<br>  <br>  6/ Prendre les choses en mains…<br>  Y’a pas de raison qu’ils fassent tout le boulot… Les gar?ons aussi ont le droit aux préliminaires.<br>  <br>  7/ N’oublie pas ses valises !!!<br>  Je sais pas si vous avez remarquez, mais sous la verge, y’a deux petites choses fragiles qu’il ne faut pas négliger pour l’envoyer direct au 7eme ciel. A manipuler délicatement …!<br>  <br>  8/ Le sexe…sans complexe !!!<br>  Fais de ce moment tant appréhendé par certains, un moment sensuel, de complicité et pourquoi pas de franche rigolade. Quand il sort la capote et qu'il l'enfile, aide-le, sinon continue à le caresser. Le principal est de le mettre à l'aise. Les pauvres, ils se sentent bien trop souvent abandonnés à ce moment du calin... <br>  <br>  9/ Quand y’a du plaisir…y’a pas de gêne !!!<br>  Les mecs aiment qu’on leur dise ce qui nous fait du bien ! Plut?t que de rester muette ou de crier à tue-tête, guide-le dans ton plaisir.<br>  <br>  10/ Trop d’émotions !!!<br>  Parfois c’est tellement bon, ou tellement surprenant qu’on en pleurerait. Eh bien n’aies pas honte s’il te vient quelques larmes de bonheur !!! C’est très bon pour leur ego. N’en fais pas trop non plus, la simulation ?a se devine !!!<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  Les 10 kiffs des filles...  <br>   <br>   <br>  ON te dévoile leurs secrets, leurs fantasmes… Bref, tout ce qui fait craquer les filles et qu’on ne leur fait pas toujours !!! <br>   <br>   <br>   1/ Y’a pas que le cadeau, y’a aussi l’emballage !!!<br>  Les filles aussi kiffent les sous-vêtements, alors oublie ton slip et saute dans un cale?on ! <br>  <br>  2/ Paradis sensoriels…<br>  Lécher les orteils, les oreilles… Pleins de petits coins comme ?a auxquels on ne pense pas toujours et qui pourtant ont un certain succès. Glisse-lui ta langue dans son oreille…effet garanti !!!<br>  <br>  3/ Jeux de mains…jeux de coquins…<br>  Pendant le calin, pense à ta partenaire !!! Stimule ses zones érogènes, continue à la caresser à lui montrer tes sentiments et dis-toi bien que le plaisir réside aussi dans celui de l’autre…<br>  <br>  4/ Le plaisir est dans le changement !!!<br>  Change de position, pour varier les plaisirs de ta partenaire. Si t’as pas d’idée, potasse le Kama-Sutra… <br>  <br>  5/ Rythmes dans la peau…<br>  Rythmes langoureux ou percutants…Si tu veux pas qu’elle s’endorme, il faut varier la cadence !!! <br>  <br>  6/ Soif d’un regard !!!<br>  Regarde-la dans les yeux, bien s?r quand la position te le permet !!! Et fais-lui passer tes émotions… Elles adorent ?a !!!<br>  <br>  7/ Fais-toi entendre !!!<br>  Manifeste ton émotion sans pour autant hurler à la mort… Tout comme toi, une fille aime savoir qu’elle te fait du bien !!! <br>  <br>  8/ L’étreindre avant qu’elle s’éteigne !!! <br>  Fais-lui sentir que son corps t’appartient, que tu es avec elle. Pendant le calin, de légères pressions au niveau des hanches, du cou… la détendront. <br>  <br>  9/ Coordination des émotions…<br>  T’arrêter en plein calin, t’occuper d’elle avec tes doigts de fée ou avec ta langue, puis reprendre de fa?on à coordonner votre plaisir, faire en sorte que tu ne jouisses pas avant elle.<br>  <br>  10/ 3ème mi-temps :<br>  Après le calin, c’est pas terminé ! Soyez là et choyez-la !!! C’est à ce moment là que tu peux jouer la carte de l’amoureux !

RD1lLEnraa	Odd is it not that we only hear about dead beat dads...but in reality there are more dead beat moms percentage wise.<br>  <br>  CHILD SUPPORT<br>  Information from multiple sources show that only 10% of all noncustodial fathers fit the "deadbeat dad" category: 90% of the fathers with joint custody paid the support due. Fathers with visitation rights pay 79.1%; and 44.5% of those with NO visitation rights still financially support their children. (Source: Census Bureau report. Series P-23, No. 173). <br>  Additionally, of those not paying support, 66% are not doing so because they lack the financial resources to pay (Source: GAO report:GAO/HRD-92-39 FS). <br>  The following is sourced from: Technical Analysis Paper No. 42, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Income Security Policy, Oct. 1991, Authors: Meyer and Garansky. <br>  Custodial mothers who receive a support award: 79.6% <br>  Custodial fathers who receive a support award: 29.9% <br>  Non-custodial mothers who totally default on support: 46.9% <br>  Non-custodial fathers who totally default on support: 26.9% <br>  <br>  Child support is not as much about what is best for the child....it is often what is best for moms and the court. <br>  <br>  If you see any news articles in your local paper about child support,  contact them and tell them your side.  Most do not realize that more women do default on child support then do men.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	I took me four years to get my ex before the courts.

If she is in violation of a court order and you are the parent who has custody of the child then you "should" be getting the support. I do believe that some states have a dollar threshold that they use in determining what action to take. When it reaches that level then they will do something. <br>  <br>  In the mean time here is what I recommend. First, since the court order determine how much she is in arrears. Second, begin establishing a relationship on this issue with your state's attorney generals office. They should be able to help work that out even if she leaves the state.<br>  <br>  In the short run though. Do not depend on her money (duh) because you can't. Also, keep the records, but also understand that the money she is not providing that allows you and the kid to get her out of your life may be money well spent. Lastly, if this is all some way of using the kid to hurt her in some sick twisted power play...then in your heart you should feel ashamed of yourself. I'm taking it for granted that you are doing this for honorable reasons, but honestly we really don't know you well enough to judge if that is true or not.|`|EcQeNu3raa	I am in the same position now with my son's father, who hasn't  paid in 3 years. I believe it should be the same for either parent. She (or no other woman ordered to pay child support) should get no special treatment because they are women. The reality is whether man or woman, the state takes their time with this. It never goes how they try to make you believe it gos (if they don't pay, they go to jail) It never goes that way. The best thing you can do is keep trying. Maybe you can speed things up by getting a private attorney. I gave up 2 years ago because I realized that seeking help from the state was going no where. Good luck.|`|gf0sAfoTaa	I believe in Equality and Equity for all in society.<br>  Laws should be there for all under Gods sky. Regardless of gender, colour, race, marital status, gender preference.<br>  <br>  The laws were made to protect women, not men<br>  Many of the workers for these agencies have a bias towards woman. You are of the wrong gender. The best I can tell you<br>  <br>  I too was a sole parent due to my wife leaving. The child is now 23 and I never received 1cent from his biological mother. I raised him from when he was 2 months old and obtained sole custody for him.  Ignore her if it causes too much angst and hurt. Do the best without her. Do your duty out of love for the kids. <br>  I decided that no one had to pay me to raise my child as I chose to do this. Do this from love and responsibility for the children.  This was my way of coping. I let her go. Women use child support mainly as a way to hurt the father.  Be bigger than that.  It hurts but we live in a women's world. Nothing is equal or fair. We must do the best we can by ourselves. <br>  Men made the rules which we are suffering now. Our governments wont change legislation, even if it's right thing to do. They are scared of the noisy feminists which are only a minority of the equality movement.  If only they could see the suffering of children and their fathers.<br>  What gender and age gruop have the highest suicide rate?<br>  I wonder why?   <br>  Our governments and the feminist movement have much blood on their hands.<br>  <br>  Chin up!

If they would (they are always looking for a NEW angle) then I'd be back informing the DA that your getting the media involved and maybe its time people new that dead beat MOM's are OK as fall as the DA's office is concerned...... When in fact it ALL should be about the children and their well being.......  Pack a lunch and head for the DA's office... tell them your not leaving until they do something.........|`|2szmFTt4aa	It can take a long time to get child support enforced, even when the non-custodial parent is working.  Have you gone through your local Child Support Enforcement office?  If not, give them a try.  It took many years for me to collect, but it was worth the wait.  Eventually the state of Oklahoma (where the non-custodial parent was living) hired private agencies to help with their workload.  It was a private firm that the state paid that finally negotiated a settlement.  It took around 5 years, but I ended up with $20,000.  <br>  <br>  Check to see if the case with the DA is still open.  If not, have them reopen it.  If it's still open, ask for an update.  Cases have a way of getting closed with the client never being told.  If you call the office up once a month for an update they are going to realize that you mean business and will pay more attention to your case.  It sounds like they haven't heard from you in over 6 months.  You have to rattle their cage once in a while (nicely), so that you remind them you're still around.  <br>  <br>  Don't take no for an answer.  Find out who is supposed to be doing what, and keep after them every step of the way.  Keep a record of the calls you make, and any contact via email or postal mail.  When they discover you are keeping an account of your attempts to collect they will suddenly become more cooperative.  <br>  <br>  The courts are bogged down, so expect delays.  Just be diligent in following up on any action that is supposed to be taken and keep pushing for what is rightfully yours.  You know the saying about the squeaky wheel.....<br>  <br>  I don't know your ex's situation, if she's willfully not supporting them, or if she has her own financial worries.  Is she currently working?  Does she have any assets?  What kind of financial situation is she in?  If her parents or a boyfriend are supporting her financially, she still has to pay child support, although she might be able to go to court to get it modified if she has no income.  You need to prove what income/assets she has, which is where a private child support enforcement company may come in handy.  If you don't mind giving the private company a percentage of what they collect, going private would be the quicker way to resolve this issue.  If you decide to go this route compare at least three different private agencies before deciding which one to use.  Read all the fine print, ask questions, and make sure you know what you're getting into before you sign any contract.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best!|`|HDHTknXpaa	Any non-custodial parent who does not pay child support is a Piece of Sh*t to me!!!

Nothing infuriates me more than a person who is so selfish and does not care or contribute to their child's wellbeing!!! UGH!!!! <br>  Also, I don't think it's just that child support is not collecting because she is the mother...personally I think it's because child support enforcement is over booked with cases and underpaid!!! good luck!!! and thank you for taking care of the kids!!!!! :0)|`|Nhss5hOEaa	is she hasn't seen  the kids for 8 months, is she still around. tiring as it is you need to keep on top of the matter. make sure your petition for failure to pay support is still active and if not, you have to refile. a willful failure to pay child support is punishable by  up to six months in jail, and considered contempt of a court order. sorry, but she seems to have dropped out of the area, so you'll have to make sure she is being notified of the hearings. the money will continue to build up and if she has disappeared, eventually you can request it be set in a judgment against her. these don't last for ever either, you have a certain amount of time and then you have to file to renew it. from experience working in family court, there are alot of stupid things people file petitions for, as in other courts, that really bog down the system and the more important things some times get pushed back and back. it was when i worked there, required that the court make a final decision within six months of the filing date of the petition. your's may have been dismissed without prejudice, which means you can file the same again.|`|RUNRzz8waa	I think she should be picked up just like we would be.<br>  This system is unfair in some ways, but all of them are.  Doesn't seem like we can ever have a perfect judgement system.<br>  <br>  I pay my support every month, usually 3 months ahead.  And I keep my son 4 months of the year on top of that.  But if i were to try and get full custody id lose just because I'm the father....nevermind the fact that she is a horrible influence on him.  Not going to get into that, but shes around bad people and showing him bad experiences.  But if you dont have videos of a mother with a damn heroin needle in her arm theres no way to win.  Yet a father can lose just because the mother says "hey i want those kids, and my check"<br>  <br>  But I digress.....yes you should call up the DA again and say what is the deal here?  I wan't some movement! <br>  Ask them why they would take money from your work check before you even see it if you were behind, but shes getting away with not paying for a year!!<br>  <br>  Does she not want to support her children?  I'd feel horrible not providing anything for my kiddo.|`|bzmYBCzNaa	I think that if you have a court order, ordering your ex-wife to pay child support that the system should do the same as they would do as if she were a man.<br>  No difference, the children are the ones who are suffering through this.<br>  <br>  Do you know if your ex-wife is working? If so when you speak with your attorney let him know this information so that they can file a order to attach her wages for the child support.<br>  Does your ex-wife have visitation with her children?<br>  <br>  Depending on the state where you live if the system is willing to exercise its right as the laws direct them to do so, and that is to enforce the child support by either parent male or female who ever has been ordered to pay should be held accountable and made to pay this money to the children.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck to you and the children.....|`|f9O1q6gxaa	because she has ovaries.....read the state law 432.5 it states that "anyone who has breasts and ovaries, she shall prevail over testes in court"   or something like that :)

Aussi, éssaies de discuter avec lui afin de savoir pourquoi il ne veut pas que les gens sachent que vous êtes ensemble ou pourquoi il ne veut jamais accepter qu'il est avec toi.

Mais ne te decourage pas si tu tiens vraiment à toi; ce qu'il faudrait , c'est qu'il s'ouvre vraiment à toi et qu'il t'avoue tout!

If it's antipyschotics, that's a good thing since she's bipolar.  If it's narcotics, that's another story.  And knowing that she is bipolar, you have to expect her to go through the phases of feeling that she's so wonderful and there's nothing wrong to being jealous of her brother for no reason. You have to deal with the good and the bad if you want to continue the relationship, because that's what a friend does. If you choose to end it, stop making excuses and tell the girl the truth! With all of her issues, she still deserves to have you be upfront and honest instead or lying all the time about why you can't do this that and the other.|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	No one likes being around someone who is negative all the time, it drags you down.|`|AA10440635	I think you guys should have a talk face to face privately.

It can make you feel bolder, funnier, sexier ... pretty much it intensifies all of your feelings.  So, if you are normally shy and reserved, people were probably surprised and amusing at a wilder side coming out in you.  But, alcohol is temporary and it doesn't change who you really are -- unless you take it to an extreme and begin to abuse it to entertain or "make friends" with people who haven't bothered to get to know the real you.  There is nothing wrong with a little buzz and a little goofing off, but NEVER think you are a better or more popular person because of alcohol!  All of those funny sayings or hearthy laughs are already in you - they are just waiting for your self-confidence to take over an allow you to be comfortable enough to be more open around other people - alcohol gave you some temporary and false confidence ... Too many alcoholics started out thinking the were "pathetic" and needed alcohol to be "fun" and "accepted" ... But, pretty soon the "funny wasted guy" can become the "obnoxious drunk" that everyone wants to run from!  Enjoy yourself, but be careful.  Alcohol does NOT make you a better person.|`|8dd24cf539cb30f8612a1d8137f91806aa	Just do it.

Being able to have a partner that will listen and who is willing to compromise, find a happy medium isn't easy. You have ways that work for you as does he. Being able to put these together and make it work for both is the key. It's not a matter of not being good. Honestly you need to talk with him being able to express what makes you go in the bedroom and having someone whos willing to listen. If he isn't then find you a more unselfish partner.|`|w2GG8Z99aa	Well it is good that your guy can be honest with you, but he needs to stop thinking only about himself and his pleasure.

Go with the beat.|`|ndVFMJbuaa	So he's rude aswell as a racist? Nice one you picked for yourself there.. |`|6E4fkWWFaa	5 minutes with me and you will be better.  free lessons. |`|AA11028314	Communication!! Ask him what you do that he does like. I try some stuff with my wife and she doesn't enjoy all of it. I don't take it personal. Just as there are things she does I don't enjoy. However, if there is something that she REALLY enjoys I will let her even though it does nothing for me, because I love her and I love seeing her enjoy me. Is there anything he has expressed interest in that you haven't tried? Have you tried bringing toys into the bedroom. Try lots of positions and see what you both enjoy. I think he could have been a little more conscience of your feelings when talking about it, but at least he was able to tell you "hey I don't like that". |`|IA1h4V9gaa	Let my husband have a go at you.  He'll make you into a porn star.<br>  <br>  OK seriously - I mean are you just jumping off?  <br>  <br>  Generally people switch positions whenever they feel like it.  If he can't handle a position change then he has some issues.  <br>  <br>  How are you doing it?  Do you just jump off?<br>  <br>  EDIT Happy 2- thanks dear.  Generally I do what I do based on how he is reacting and how much I am enjoying it.  If I am totally getting off on it, I keep going.  If he is totally getting off on it, I keep going. <br>  <br>  Just watch him.  Try different grindings and such and see how he reacts.  When he obviously likes something, keep doing it.|`|IbJ2O0vpaa	Your boyfriend is blaming you for his problems.  He doesn't understand how sex works.  You don't look like a fool.  He sounds foolish and rude from your post.<br>  <br>  You don't have the control over your partner's movements the way you have control over your hand masturbating, but... you get to be with your partner having sex.  That's life.  He needs to get used to it.<br>  <br>  He's just frustrated that he's having difficulty reaching orgasm sometimes and at those times, sometimes it seems like your partner finally has just the right rhythm and it's going to work and... they start doing something else.<br>  <br>  Mature humans can deal with this several ways.  They can say, "Oh, please don't stop that!"  That works well for my wife and me.  They can tell you what they like instead of making you guess.  Or they can realize, hey, the sex is nice today, but I'm not going to have an orgasm for whatever reason, and it's not my partner's fault.<br>  <br>  The way he put it was insulting, rude, and verbally abusive, I think.  Feelings are so sensitive about sex - talking about it calls for being gentle with feelings, not talking about seizures.  I'd let him do all the work if I let him near me, personally, but maybe you can inform him that he could communicate better about what he likes and doesn't - and don't be shy about doing the same with him.|`|AA12392755	Doesn't sound like you have a problem other than a bf who is more interested in himself than in you.  Personally I concentrate on the woman's pleasure cause that gives me pleasure too.  Somehow the idea that he "can't get into it" just because you want to change position sounds very selfish to me.  Give me a call, I will fix you up.  LOL|`|52092e43afb48f25c3b2832d7f29ae10aa	Wow......that's just crazy.  <br>  <br>  Never in my life have I come across a guy who has EVER said anything even close to that.  Most guys prefer the girl to be on top, how could you be doing it wrong?  That doesn't even make sense.  There is no WRONG way......he's a jackass, find a new boyfriend.<br>  <br>  maybe he's gay?<br>  <br>  so weird.......|`|woOeYFrEaa	Why don't you ask him to put his hands on your hips and guide you in the rhythm that he enjoys.  Only he can tell you what he'd like you to do differently.  My husband speaks up and tells me what I can do differently.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Find yourself another boyfriend who  cares whether he's hurting your feelings!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Your dating a very cold one there????|`|NuUdCz0Laa	You got me when you stated you suck in bed.  Okay, so your dealing with an insensitive jerk, that has been established.  Now, you need to let him show you what would work best for him, have him demonstrate the technique he wants you to use and the speed.  During the demonstration you can burst out laughing and tell him he suck at being a girl.  It is apparent that your in the wrong relationship, because if he loved you, he would work with you and not ridicule you.  I would re-evaluate this relationship and if you decide to stay, just be warned that he most likely will leave you for someone who can ride a cowboy like a pro.  Good luck.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	The key to any good relationship is communication. He felt he could be honest with you. Good for him. He also told you about a problem and did not let it go. Why do you switch gears? Try not to do that. Also, ask him then what he wants. He is the best one to tell you  this. Communication during sex is a good thing. It sounds like things are a little erratic, when you switch gears as you put it, slow it down and glide into it. |`|AA10182431	Well I think talking about stuff is important but in this case did he bother to ask you why you changed gears and how it made you feel?  Obviously when you change gears it is for a reason.  If that is what it takes for you to get into it then he needs to know that.  He shouldn't be an *** and just worry about what he is into, it should be about you as well.|`|53a74743d23e11adcec737c47684f9f0aa	Tell him when he's on top, he can set the pace but when he's on the bottom, he's the *****.|`|rWCliJTuaa	Instead of a white guy on the dance floor hire a black guy to show you the moves.|`|FdesH76eaa	Personally, as I guy, I find it's like dancing.

9f38db29a31bdd91f3bba66fada40705aa	this may sound cheesy but she might really like it.  Go to the craft store and get a giraffe bead (I am pretty sure they still exist, they are usually wood) and choose some other beads to go with it and some twine and you should be able to make her a cute little bracelet or necklace. It should cost under ten dollars maybe even under five. It's cheap and sweet.|`|74e23bdc063e47b12bb302a851a34603aa	how about a giraff or an animal keyring <br>  <br>  after all a dead giraff probably won't be the best gift =D|`|d03cfdeb099a1c1bfb5cf098f06aae2faa	If she collects giraffe's , get her one, she can add it to her collection.

ba808642a0667193fc002c2bbda18db5aa	A shy girl, huh?  That's not so bad, and she'll probably become more outgoing in time (w/lots of support from you).  She'd probably prefer some 'alone time' with you as opposed to being in a big crowd--and that's a good thing.  It's summer time and lots to do outdoors.  You could plan a hike, you could go to the lake (know anybody with a boat or jetski), you could bring food or cookout, you could go rollerskating (or anything else you think she might enjoy or be particularly good at).  If you know her parents or siblings you could ask them what they think might be fun for her--they'd be flattered by such questions.  It's important to totally focus on her during the date, keep good eye contact, make sure she knows you're interested in what she has to say, be a good listener, pay her sincere compliments, etc.  One thing that might make the date even more memorable, bring along a disposable camera (so you don't worry about losing or destroying it) and make pictures.  Be sure to get someone you encounter (strangers don't usually mind) to snap a shot of the two of you in front of some cool background scene (e.g. blue sky, mountains, water, etc.)  Make this a private connection between the two of you and determine to learn as much about her as possible.  You'll make an impression and I feel sorry for the guys she dates in the future that will be compared to you dude.  good luck & have fun|`|Bx2w3h0faa	Well if she doesnt like eating infront of anyone at the moment than dinner is out of the option at this point.<br>  <br>  I would recommend a date where you two get some alone time to talk wiether if its a park, bowling alley, a mall. Just get some time to where you both can sit down and have a real good conversation.<br>  <br>  If you get past the conversation part, you are usually in the green which mean she is going to want to spend more time with you regardless of where its at. <br>  <br>  Lay off of the repeatitive hand holding kissing and hugging. Its usually too strong of a move to be done on the first date let those come with time they make the moments much more worth while anyways.|`|5c390403d90921b2822b3b57cce4b890aa	She doesn't eat in front of people?

Rmz23cCzaa	I prefer leather cuffs or ropes.|`|QTNqn7PGaa	either.. will do the job...
WZ0jWRasaa	Personally, no. Smoking is not attractive. At all. In the slightest. It's sick and has no good outcomes whatsoever. <br>  Riding a motorcycle is pretty cool. As long as he's not pretending to be the 'big, bad boy who speeds everywhere, thinking he'll get girls attention when all he's doing is leaving them in a cloud of dust.'<br>   |`|1PdUecpYaa	yes but they smell disgusting though.. that's the only thing i hate about smoking and that's why i quit.|`|ZtDiWBjmaa	Not necessarily. Depends on the guy. <br>  Motorcyles don't mean anything to me.. but a guy who smokes just kind of says that he doesn't care and odds are he is more layed back which is hot.. but also it shows personality traits that are prone to addiction which is quiet the opposite of hot|`|u4FU1RlEaa	i think smoking is quite attractive if you only do it occasionally ( don't want any 40 cigs a day guys), and deal with the stale smell<br>  <br>  motorbikes aren't my thing really, some girls go crazy for it though|`|zAT1nrcyaa	noo.<br>  Smoking is disgusting. I wouldn't want to kiss a guy who smokes.|`|Yc8mcp03aa	I'm so sorry but smoking is like EWWWW. I mean bad breath and no respect for yourself >< please... <br>  Meh, big black motorbike as long as it has brakes i don't really mind but the fact that its really big does not make you cool, wait to be real i prefer bicycles because at least the dude on it is getting some exercise!<br>  <br>  LOL |`|E5hQFAqzaa	No way! If you smoke you would have bad breath and yellow teeth. What do you think the girl that you would want to kiss feel? Of course they'll feel that your gross.<br>  <br>  Well about the motorcycle, maybe not so big and not just black. Just make it not a girly color. (like pink)|`|GxsOXy0xaa	ya sometimes i find my bf attractive when he smokes but most of the time i hate it. <br>  <br>  motorcycle dont mean anything to me. cos i only the possibilities of getting into accident. never get a motor bike even if u cant afford a car. |`|NzL8ih2Uaa	yes but they stink of smoke its distgusting and if they smoke around you arrgh that really annoys me!! and its not good for your health either!<br>  I dont think having a motor bike makes you cooler not in my eyes just makes you stupid no affence! |`|C9J2YUGuaa	smoking is a BIG turnoff, horrible habit that kills you and your stinky and have yellow teeth, ew<br>  haha yeh motorbikes always go down well<br>  x|`|3baa0fa122d5073b13f8b5ba286224f2aa	Smoking is nasty and I smoke unfortunately.  Doesn't really make anyone more or less attractive to me.  Motorcycle now to me is way HOT!|`|qLnl17VFaa	It doesn't really matter if a guy smokes or not. I'm more into personality |`|u8ZsBvRTaa	Yeah it is sometimes, But they have to be either nice or good looking as well. xx|`|4f4ee407d046096178a2122f624fb58daa	yes, as long the smoke isnt near me. smoking is gross.
2b0a3200c0db672cf39c688cc41d456caa	I would.  I'd think that it's cool you're that open about it, and not wanting to hide anything.  Very refreshing.|`|EIsnATLxaa	Probably not....depends|`|ZftI0W4Eaa	Honestly I wouldn't and I don't think anyone would.<br>  One of my friends has done it and it disgusts be. There are so many more ways to get rid of those feelings and she honestly doesn't have ay reason for it. Ive been in times where I'm hurting so much its stupid because of things people have said/done but I would never do that because it disgusts me.|`|WEU6hrrzaa	yes we all had something in or past , why should i judge you if you dealt with things that way.|`|3qLIRorjaa	No  i'd think you were a freak|`|2oc6TDiGaa	it depends on how your personality is.|`|X4hz3a9haa	yes i would still want to know you.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	Yes, I would still want to get to know you.|`|MHg9JhEKaa	I would feel more comfortable with her if she also added something like 'but I am better now / I got help and no longer harm myself' <br>  <br>  Unless of course you aren't better... it would make me wonder why you self harmed, not to judge but to understand, so that as a potential friend I would know if there's something I should avoid talking about. <br>  <br>  To be honest I would make some effort to hide the scars, because openly displaying them all the time could be seen as you wanting to be asked about them.|`|7ntSRsZLaa	I'd get to know you still.|`|kwMA5I1iaa	I actually got to know a girl that used to cut. Unfortunately she was a little to crazy for me and we aren't friends anymore.<br>  (She'd do some weird things to get attention...like at the restaurant she "fell" out of her chair and started crying. lol. We were both 20 years old at the time but she still acted like she was 12)<br>  <br>  Anyways, yes, I would give you a chance. Doesn't mean I'll stay friends if you're crazy...but if you are a cool person then I don't see why the past would defer me.|`|e7f7b9508f28f00c8e34cd692587ca8caa	I would still try and get to know her|`|AA11108018	there is no reason not to become friends with you|`|iDTrTvg4aa	yes ., i will  still .....  wants to  know u more &  give some help &  suggestions|`|m2WGmGXjaa	Yes, I'd still get to know you<br>  You're not a freak just because you used to self harm, some people just can't deal with things and that's there way of coping. It's quite a destructive behavior, but with proper support and help one can stop. And since you have stopped, I'm sure it's just made you a stronger person. Some people might not think of it this way, but others will. Just find the nice people who will get to know you, for exactly who you are. Not what you used to do, the past is irrelevant.<br>  <br>  Besides, you're only human. You've made mistakes and been through rough times, just like anyone else. Your form of coping just wasn't the best one in the world.|`|WNxTv08Taa	Yeah,<br>  <br>  I'd still want to get to know you.<br>  There's this fantastic girl who I work with who went through depression and self harmed, she has scars over her arms and I get on with her better than anyone else in my team. She's only been here a few months and the rest of the team about 2 years.<br>  <br>  The person underneath is what matters, especially when they have an awesome personality. <br>  <br>  Besides, anybody who wouldn't want to get to know you ( taking into account that you are at least a very nice person and easy to get on with )  is pretty shallow IMO|`|5aXKo6uCaa	emos|`|5YSDsMcmaa	cutting is a very serious disorder, that requires ongoing counseling. If you are truly done i think to share with others what you have been thru and the results of it would be a big help to others who may be doing this and still hiding it. you have alot to offer, maybe you can make a difference in others lives.|`|a017d5b848ff6918c2d2ad130e54c9c1aa	You know, eveybody has their own "scars" whether they show or not.<br>  We all have our problems. It's how you deal with lifes problems that matters most. The fact that you "don't do it anymore" tells me that you've probably learned from your mistakes and that makes you a wiser person. I would certainly wnat to get to know you as a friend. :-)<br>  Good luck to you!|`|Xf93fRTTaa	I think it would definitely put thoughts in my head such as "Why would she cut herself" and "What's her problem?"<br>  <br>  I would definitely be quick to judge. My cousin has scars all over her arms from that and I lost quite a bit of respect for her due to that fact.|`|31bd301492d159191dacd31abd1b95e8aa	I wouldn't say that I wouldn't want to get to know you.<br>  <br>  Kudos to you for being honest about it, but I would question your reasons for having them on display all the time it kind of suggests you seem to be proud of them! Which leads me to think you might be attention seeking.<br>  <br>  I am ashamed of my scars.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	you can't hide your arms forever, and it's good that you tell the truth from the get-go.  it's also good that you don't do it anymore.  everyone has their skeletons in the closet.  i'd want to get to know you.|`|AA10747402	Yes I would still get to know you.. We all have gone through some rough times. I bet that you'll meet lots of people who have or still do cut themselves. The most important and the most impressive part is that you're not doing it any more. I'm proud of you for stopping.|`|dbCkTKDxaa	no me myself i would want to get to know you and help you throw it and try my best to get you to talk about it and try to get you to stop . and see why you did.|`|bJrT3EzQaa	I wouldn't discriminate against you cuz you used to self inflict that's your business and I'm not your father, mother or God so i can't judge your actions. But i would still be your friend.|`|vwmLhmNWaa	I would, everyone needs someone, and a few scars on someone's arms isnt a big deal!<br>  Dont worry about it, im sure alot of people want to get to know you!<br>  <br>  :D x<br>  <br>  **And, there's nothing wrong with emo girls, they look gooood!<br>  <br>  :P|`|scnW0Wzeaa	Sounds like a deeply disturbed girl. I would be nice to her. But would not get involved. I don't need the grief.|`|d40e4596ee31f7749a7773684fe3ab6baa	I think some people would shy away from someone who was so direct however im sure there are lots of nice people out there who can see beyond a former problem. Hope you find some great friends. good luck take care xx|`|q0H3St1Oaa	That's weird....no.|`|yhsi0sWzaa	nope.. sounds like to much drama to deal with.|`|P0qTmwtFaa	awww sweetie don't worry about them, everyone has or has had some issue or another, and most people won't be bothered about your scars...<br>  <br>  personally i wouldn't bother about them at all, and i can relate in some ways anyway coz i've been in a dark place before...<br>  <br>  the people who make an issue probably have bigger problems themselves, just ignore them and be you because i'm sure your a great person :)|`|fspDJqFAaa	honestly i'd believe people would be very cautious and nervous of you. They probably wouldn't want to mix with you and stick with the people they know. There is bar far means anything wrong with you but you will probably find people nagging you about it and pestering you. You should find that there is at least one person out there who will respect you for the person you are.|`|V4qiwSZOaa	I'd still talk to you - If you want we can be online friends - my name is Anthony Willis - I live in Dorset England - anthonywillis1993@hotmail.co.uk -|`|5WiMATg2aa	yeah i don't think that changes anything<br>  i would want to be friends with that person more because of their honesty and how open they were<br>  and how they're not afraid to talk about that kind of thing<br>  if someone had a problem with it, they could choose not to be friends with you, its as simple as that|`|yI8i0yZgaa	Nothing to be ashamed of. Lots of people have done it. I'd still get to know you|`|CBbsulYCaa	I would be worried that you still have problems and could become very high maintenence. I think when you explain it you should very briefly make it clear that you are over it. That is, you can say something like "I used to self harm before I got over it/recovered  etc"|`|qWVuVRq3aa	personally, for me, no, it wouldn't, cuz i have the same thing.  From my knowledge and past expreience, yeah, I think others might run away, especially boys, cuz then people would think that you're extremely unstable, and the boy especially doesn't want to worry about breaking your heart and making you hurt yourself more.  Also, when you show people your scars, they know you're showing it off, which means that you want attention, but they don't find that really attractive.  Personally, I'd find it attractive as hell and have a connection and big feelings of empathy towards that person.  But it's better if you try to hide them, (and yeah, i know, it's really hard) and then when they see them (to them, you're not supposed to know that they saw them and make them think you don't want them to see.) to them, that'd make them feel more sorry for you (please don't be offended if i'm getting you wrong, but in my opinion, underneath it all, i know there's a part of you that wants people to know and want their attention and their pity.  That feeling is under there, i know it. well, i know it is with me, at least. and when they ask about it, i'd say to jerk your fist away if they try to look at it. it'd have a better effect, i think....<br>  <br>  and I don't mean to be psychoanalytical - ok, i do, - (haha, that's like saying "no offense", shut up you mean all the offense in the world) but I see behind the reason for you phrasing the question that way. blaahhhh, ok, now i'm just jerking around. lol. nvm.)|`|6zGvPgiIaa	Well, I'm glad you stopped.  That's for sure.<br>  <br>  I don't judge people based on their pasts.  So, if she was a legit interest to me, I'd try to get to know her.

yhly3ecLaa	Salut,<br>  Je n'oserais pas me comparer à Zian, je ne crois pas avoir de talents dans les domaines où il excelle.<br>  Je n'avais jamais entendu parlé de Zian, mais Google c'est tellement simple : c'est un conteur et colporteur de contes, qui vit en Savoie. Au pied de 3 majestueux pics rocheux, les Aiguilles d'Arves. D'où j'ai imaginé que Frissons & Roches avait à voir avec ces pics vraiments impressionnants, faisant frissonner même des alpinistes et grimpeurs comme moi. <br>  <a href="http://www.ziandesalpes.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ziandesalpes.com/</a><br>  <br>  Zian est un prénom très rare en France, une centaine d'enfants nommés ainsi et seul dans les dernières années, l'origine semble arabe / maghrébine.<br>  <br>  Il vit à Albiez, un petit village de montagne tout près de St-Jean de Maurienne, au pied des fameux cols du Tour de France comme le Galibier, la Croix-de-Fer, etc.<br>  Il a publié 2 tomes de contes et légendes en 2003 et 2005, est le créateur et organisateur du Festival des Contes et Légendes de montagne en Albiez depuis 1996. <br>  <br>  Je n'ai pas trouvé son age, mais à voir sa photo il doit avoir environ 50 ans, soit encores des décennies pour réjouir ses admirateurs, publier, organiser et acquérir une plus grande notorité. Les conteurs de légendes connus sont volontiers des "vieux sages". Il a donc encore bien du temps devant lui.<br>   <br>  Zian appara?t aussi comme un personnage dans un roman "retour à la montagne" (1957) du célébrissime guide-alpiniste et prolifique auteur chamoniard de récits de courses et de romans se passant en haute montagne : Roger Frison-Roche (1906-1999). Là je n'aimerais pas me sentir Zian, car dans ce récit, Zian à été tué par sa femme, lol !!!|`|LoHhCXsraa	frison roche pas frisson , je ne connaissait pas zian<br>  <br>  mais je connaissais mon papa mort en montagne, il était devenue guide de moyenne montagne, s'offrait les sommets de la planete,faisait du saut de falaise, de la grimpe ou du ski de rando et un jour ensoleillé le 5 em de sa course; il fut emporté par une avalanche.il est mort dans sa passion, mais j'aurais bien voulus qu'elle dure plus longtemps.<br>  <br>  c'était en savoie , le massif des beauges en mars 2005<br>  <br>  j'aime le free ride en surf, peut etre les éléments m'arreteront ils eux aussi un jour.|`|htQAIPMfaa	Dommage qu'elle soit supprimée ?a fait marcher mes méninges....|`|fnHKdXLOaa	je ne comprends pas !!!!<br>  suis je limité intellectuellement ?|`|2qL213pkaa	en arabe ,on dit "meziane" :cela veut dire beau!!!<br>  vous connaissez sans soute le sens de "ZEN".. <br>  de toutes les fa?ons ,je suis zen...et mon epouse me trouve (me "zian")..<br>  dommage pour la question supprimée!!!!|`|8027a3cfee93fd936149961e4c31572eaa	La grande cordée|`|8IneaRcKaa	c le blanc de la laine,c l'acteur de la scène,c la valeur de la mienne....et surtout l'influence de qq chose qui nous gène...|`|yjlACkruaa	Et qui se sent Dom, Noen ?

Pourquoi ne pas les laisser vivre comme bon leur semble, à leur guise. Ils sont à  leur manière en total symbiose avec la nature. Pour survive ils ne prennent que ce qu’il leur est nécessaire à leur survie. Pourquoi vouloir les emprisonner dans un système de dictature qu’ils ne connaissent pas.<br>  <br>  Nous, nous avons aucune possibilité de revenir à leur mode de vie, et nous nous sommes bien prisonnier de nos idées et de notre mode de vie.

v9prke1iaa	IAGO d’après Othello de Shakespeare<br>  <br>  A force de courage et de grandeur d’ame, Othello, esclave maure affranchi, est devenu général et a épousé Desdemona, rayonnante jeune fille de la noblesse vénitienne. Jaloux de son éloquence, ses talents guerriers et son succès auprès des femmes, Iago, son homme de main, a juré sa perte. Ce théatre regorge de trouvailles techniques et artistiques. Les décors témoignent d’une ingéniosité époustouflante. La mise en scène est, quant à elle, un défi d’interprétation. Les personnages sont des marionnettes en bois, véritables oeuvres d’art de la récupération. Seul Iago est interprété par deux comédiens qui illustrent, entre loyauté et perfidie, les deux faces du personnage : celle qu’il montre et celle qu’il dissimule…|`|htQAIPMfaa	Lago est un personnage tiré du drame de Schakespeare " Othello " " Méfiez-vous Seigneur, la jalousie est un monstre aux yeux verts qui se nourrit de sa propre substance " C'est l'avertissement que Lago à Othello alors qu'il fait tout pour l'engluer dans une jalousie morbide afin de mieux le perdre. C'est ce qu'il réussira mais sans accéder au pouvoir.........|`|fnHKdXLOaa	lago ?<br>  syndrome de Stockholm?<br>  je ne vois pas le rapport ....................<br>  j'ai eu hélas l'occasion d'être otage..............<br>  s?rement pas assez longtemps pour développer le syndrome de Stockholm, et suffisamment pour vouloir la mort du preneur d'otages qui avait son fusil sur le ventre de mon assistante enceinte de 8 mois !! j'ai réussi à prendre sa place!!et à négocier contre des espèces!!<br>  l'enculé de corse cagoulé!!! il a eu les assises!!<br>  et ce n'était pas du Shakaespeare.........|`|LwAOqIKxaa	je ne connais pas le complexe de Lago mais suis interessé par ce fameux syndrome de stockholm.

Un Iago pétri de machiavélisme qui va mettre son intelligence complexe et perverse au service d'une envie vénéneuse.|`|yjlACkruaa	C'est un mystère pour moi, Noen. Et je suis impatiente de conna?tre la réponse que tu vas élire.<br>  Pour tout te dire, j'ai beaucoup de mal avec le théatre de Shakespeare dont je n'ai pas même réussi à finir de lire "La Tempête", tu vois...  <br>  Shakespeare a cette particularité biographique remarquable d'être mort la même année que Cervantès et selon le biographe, le même jour que Cervantès... ! <br>  Ses "Sonnets" en revanche, dont l'attribution est aussi discutée, sont véritablement admirables.
x5I5IOr6aa	Je ne sais pas si c’est presque répondre, mais c’est de mon point de vue le début d’une bonne communication. Chercher à comprendre et ensuite être compris…<br>  <br>  Pourquoi faut-il comprendre avant d'être compris, car si souhaites que tes messages soit re?us et assimilés il te faut ouvrir l'esprit du récepteur et pour cela il existe 2 clés.<br>  <br>  1) Communiquer ton respect à ton interlocuteur en gardant ton silence pendant l'écoute.<br>  2) En ayant une écoute empathique cela consiste, en faisant abstraction de tes sentiments, à être capable d'exprimer ceux de celui qui est en face (cela ne veut pas dire que tu partages ses conceptions, il faut être franc avec lui). L'objectif étant d'être capable de voir le monde comme il le voit afin de comprendre son mode de raisonnement. L'utilisation de ces 2 clés permettrons à ton interlocuteur de se sentir important et compris avec ses sentiments uniques, alors vous pourrez engager une véritable relation et tu pourras le conseiller ou échanger…<br>  Nota :  Nos perceptions sont induites par notre expérience ce qui influence nos sentiments, nos croyances et notre comportement. Les conflits de personnalités ou rupture de communication sont liés au fait que chaque personne concernée pense que le monde est tel qu’il est (comme elle le per?oit) en méconnaissant éventuellement la distorsion de leurs propres perceptions.|`|8IneaRcKaa	par fois c mieux d'être sourd....|`|c0Bj2hLmaa	Tout a fait d'accord  Aujourd'hui on n'écoute plus , partout on vous coupe avant que vous ayez le temps de vous expliquer , administrations , radio , professeurs ,  interlocuteurs  Avant c'était une impolitesse de ne pas laisser les autres dire  ce qu'ils avaient  a dire , même chez les députés de tous les bords politiques  qui donnent pas le bon exemple en étant les garant de la politesse , des lois , mais aussi de l'expression démocratique de chacun|`|fnHKdXLOaa	ah , oui , une vérité!!<br>  savoir écouter!! c'est presque comprendre.........<br>  mais c'est être ouvert, et ?a c'est plus dur...........|`|48DMwCVaaa	écouter, c'est la toile du chef d'oeuvre de l'amour humain.|`|AfMs7W7Eaa	pas "presque"|`|L86FTrQiaa	l'unique probleme qui est à la base de tous les maux sur terre est savoir ECOUTER ,|`|yCqCG1Uiaa	non et non!!!<br>  sur Q/R c'est surtout bien lire...passe que moi j'ai essayé d'ecouter et j'entends aucune des questions posees ici..:))|`|seWZxCFSaa	Bonsoir noeN !<br>  C'est peut être ce qui manque le plus en ce moment ou l'on répond avant même que la personne est finit de parler. Savoir écouter c'est arriver à comprendre une personne, dans ses silence , dans sa maldresse à s'exprimer ; c'et la rejoindre la ou elle en est. Et la une réponse peut surgire souvent de la personne elle même et c'est ce qu'il y a de mieux . Ecouter aussi le monde en marche c'est aussi vrai pour y déceler les solitudes qui ne savent comment s'exprimer et à qui ?|`|htQAIPMfaa	Bien écouter, c'est comprendre et aider le cas échéant....

Mais qu'est-ce qu'ils ont contre le petit déj ?<br>  Donc à l'époque, je me serais bien nourrie de hamsters mais c'était fort difficile dans le village de 100 000 habitants où je vivais d'en trouver des gros, gras, juteux. Donc, on tentait de me faire avaler d'immondes breuvages au go?t chocolaté alors que je n'aimais pas encore le chocolat. Tout y passa : boisson au malt et ?ufs (enfin ?a c'est mon étymologie perso), cacao au nom flamand préparé avec combien de patience (une cuillerée pour 3 de sucres, on mélange, un peu de lait froid, on mélange, on ajoute le reste du lait bouillant avec la peau (ben oui j'aimais ?a la peau du lait et je ne savais même pas que ?a existait en demi-écrémé).

AaQLU3zvaa	Pour charmante que ne connait pas NERUDA:<br>  <br>  Le grand poète chilien du XXe siècle (1904-1973), chantre <br>  de l'Amérique latine et des idées communistes.<br>  <br>  Neftali Ricardo Reyes est né en 1904, à Parral (Chili). Il est le fils d'un cheminot et d'une institutrice qui meurt deux mois après sa naissance. Le futur poète passe son enfance à Temuco, en Auracanie, près d'une vaste forêt. C'est là qu'en 1917, il publie son premier article dans le journal local. L'année suivante paraissent ses premières poésies qu'il signera Pablo Neruda à partir de 1920. Ce pseudonyme deviendra son nom légal en 1946. Il l'a choisi en hommage au poète tchèque Jan Neruda (1834-1891).<br>  <br>  En 1921 Il s’installe à Santiago où il suit, à l’Institut pédagogique, les cours de préparation au professorat de fran?ais. Il publie régulièrement des poèmes ainsi que des articles de critique littéraire pour Claridad. En juin 1924, son premier chef-d'?uvre, Vingt poèmes d’amour et une chanson désespérée est publié par les éditions Nascimento (Santiago).<br>  <br>  ? Très t?t reconnu, il abandonne ses études pour se consacrer à la littérature, avec un penchant marqué pour l'avant-garde de l'époque, André Breton et ses précurseurs " voyants " : William Blake, Rimbaud, Lautréamont. Ne bénéficiant pas des revenus qui lui permettraient, comme tout littérateur qui se respecte, de vivre en rentier, il entre dans la "carrière", comme on dit encore à cette époque où la langue internationale est le fran?ais, où Neruda excelle. ? (L'Humanité, 25 septembre 2003) <br>  <br>  En 1927, il est nommé consul ad honorem à Rangoon, Birmanie, puis en 1928 consul à Colombo, Ceylan. En 1929 il assiste au Congrès panindien de Calcutta. L'année suivante, il est consul à Batavia (Java)., puis à Singapour. En 1932, il retourne au Chili.<br>  <br>  ? Avec Lorca, à travers lui, Neruda établit un pont avec toute la jeune poésie espagnole.<br>  <br>  J'aime beaucoup Oscar Wilde ( parmi  beaucoup d'autres ) ses citations me vont toujours droit au coeur.|`|VRXNp2oUaa	is it a question? we're a little bit confuse|`|f41b95f72393beba255ecace235f8bbeaa	...........|`|ND24IThZaa	Si Pablo Neruda est votre poète préféré , le mien est Victor Hugo<br>  Je ne sais pas si je réponds à votre question ???....|`|cbf41f6ae9167bfa2da0edc12a890a93aa	qui est ce pablo neruda

Rmz23cCzaa	Start with tying his hands behind his back or the headboard. Make a blindfold from a folded scarf. <br>  The keywords for this game are "tease", "surprise" and "experiment". Use your hands and objects like feathers, scarves, oil, your nails... Vary a lot, explore his whole body, talk to him, teasingly.<br>  <br>  From time to time, just stop, make him beg to continue. Take your time, he isn't going anywhere :)|`|3264b09af40e6311a70d315c1f4ed8e3aa	Try something simple like just tying your hands to a headboard.  You can use loose knots or bows so that you can untie yourself at any point.<br>  <br>  The most important thing about bondage is that you need to be able to trust your partner so that if you ever want to stop or be untied or whatever, he will oblige immediately.|`|0GDJHxenaa	1) Agree ahead of time on a safeword.  This is something where if he says it, he gets released immediately.  Mine is to sing (or hum) a song, any song.  This will let him beg and plead freely, and you to understand it is part of the enjoyment.<br>  <br>  2) To start out romantically - tie his hands behind his back using stockings or an old tie.  Feed him dinner (finger food).  Let him drink from a straw.  Feel free to flirt, as you control the pace.<br>  <br>  3) To start sexually - use stockings or an old tie to tie his hands to the headboard.  This is your opportunity for foreplay as long as you choose to.|`|Wlv0ZC64aa	You could always push him down onto the bed, get on top of him, and tie his hands behind his back.  Or perhaps push him into a chair and tie him up there and pleasure him.|`|nkhoIyQjaa	Tell him you wouldnt mind trying it but dont know much about it. Let him know you want to start off simple and if you like it then you guys can try bigger better things with the bondage.<br>  <br>  Start out with cuffs or leather straps and work your way up to the upside-down-leather-spike thingy! lmao<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|rpqIYtgvaa	You never mentioned if he likes being the top or if he wants you to be the top.

I don't think it's about suicide but the weird relationship of pain having to be involved with sexual and emotional needs/desires.  She grew up in a fairly recluse religious family life.  If he really does care, he will listen to you and eventually grow out of it or at least do it in a creative and healthy way, that's what I've learned to accept.<br>  <br>  If he does get completely out of control with it, intervention may be needed.  Cutting is a really common deviant behavior.

Bbj5vi5Baa	Ce manque peut être, non pas l'amour lui-même, mais un signe de "l'amour" dans le sens qu'on donne communément à ce mot, qui en comporte un certain nombre - notion qu'étrangement la langue fran?aise, si riche de nuances par ailleurs, ne sait pas exprimer dans ses différentes acceptions par des vocables distincts ; ce sens commun qui correspond à l'expression "être amoureux", ou bien plus largement "avoir de l'affection pour" (son conjoint, ses enfants, ses amis, ses proches...).<br>  <br>  Ce terme d'affection précise mieux la nature du sentiment en cause : c'est un sentiment qui affecte, concernant une relation qui rend vulnérable. Cette relation est effectivement, comme il a été évoqué, une relation d'attachement (qui induit effectivement une "dépendance" psychologique aux personnes liées).<br>  <br>  Le "manque" éprouvé en l'absence de la personne à laquelle on est attaché provient d'un sentiment d'incomplétude, souvent exprimé en termes de "solitude" : <br>  <a href="http://fr.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiXJuZ8UcfTYC1f8vxhWKuUGBAx.;_ylv=3?qid=20080212063450AADCLsK">http://fr.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  Il est avant tout un indicateur que l'on ne se sent pas "complet" par soi-même, puisque l'on recherche (consciemment ou non) un complément à soi hors de soi. C'est donc la marque d'un équilibre intérieur non trouvé, qui laisse la personne en attente d'une stimulation extérieure induite par la relation "aimante" pour se sentir (ré)confortée.<br>  Si la personne ressent un manque à être, c'est bien qu'elle ne se sent pas "entière" par elle-même.<br>  <br>  Soyons clairs : je ne suis pas en train de décrire une pathologie, mais un processus comportemental largement partagé, et par l'espèce humaine, et, selon l'éthologie, par une grande part de la gent animale. Le comportement d'attachement prenant diverses formes selon le degré d'évolution : qui n'a pas constaté ou entendu parler de l'attachement "affectueux" de chiens pour leur ma?tre ? A d'autres degrés, il en va de même pour nombre d'espèces de mammifères familiers. Et des études ont prouvé que les "grands singes" peuvent ressentir entre eux un attachement de type affectueux (sans parler de certains oiseaux comme les canards, qui par instinct, vont s'attacher au premier objet de contact au sortir de l'oeuf, comme si c'était leur mère, lorsqu'elle est accidentellement absente : une cafetière, un bout de corde, que sais-je...). Mais l'être humain a la faculté de mentaliser, verbaliser, voire romancer cet attachement, et l'appeler "amour".<br>  <br>  Désolé si je donne ainsi l'impression de démystifier, mais ce n'est pas l'intention : la nature profonde de cette forme d'amour, qui est de l'attachement, n'enlève rien à sa valeur humaine, qui réside dans le sens intime que l'Homme donne aux phénomènes, aux évènements et à ce qui les relie. Simplement, il s'agit de tout autre chose que l'Amour (caritas, agapè, "compassion") que l'on peut éprouver pour autrui, sentiment totalement gratuit et non personnalisé, qui n'attend rien en retour. Cette forme-là d'amour, ne se porte pas sur un objet d'attachement particulier (telle ou telle personne), car il émane d'un être qui est par lui-même dans un certain état de plénitude ; sauf chez les êtres accomplis, "éveillés" (s'il en est), cet état n'est pas permanent. A l'inverse, il en va de même pour cette impression de "vide" que l'on peut ressentir par incomplétude, lorsqu'une personne à laquelle on est attaché vient à manquer. Car sauf, justement, à être pleinement accompli, tous les "états d'ame" sont passagers.<br>  <br>  Sur ce que l'on peut ou doit faire lorsque quelqu'un nous manque, il appartient sans doute à chacun d'y répondre, au moment présent. Il n'y a pas de réponse toute faite, et nul ne peut être pris en modèle par un autre. Comme pour toute situation, il faut décider en connaissance de cause. C'est à dire aussi, avant tout, en connaissance de soi... "écoute ton coeur".<br>  <br>  Bonne journée !<br>  <br>  < Philippides : pour résumer mon propos, sans doute trop long pour que tu y aies vraiment porté attention - sans quoi tu n'aurais pas manqué de remarquer que je ne cherche pas à définir l'amour, mais à répondre à l'interrogation : "Quand vous éprouvez le "manque" de quelqu'un ou quelqu'une, est-ce de l'amour ?" ; à laquelle je réponds en substance que c'est surtout le signe de l'attachement, quel que soit le nom qu'on donne à l'aspect sentimental (= ressenti mental) de ce lien affectif.<br>  <br>  Que l'attachement soit une cause potentielle de souffrance (par "manque"), c'est un simple constat, une expérience que chacun fait un jour ou l'autre. Souffrance dont on sort par le haut via ce cheminement intérieur nommé "deuil", qui mène à l'acceptation.<br>  <br>  Quant à l'Amour, le sens que je donne à ce mot, dans son acception universelle et non singulière, dépasse largement le cadre de la relation amoureuse. C'est un sentiment qui survient justement lorsqu'on accède à un ordre de relation autre que l'attachement. Or ce n'est qu'un point de vue...<br>  <br>  <br>  < Bises Herculine : attention au fond ambivalent d'une relation fusionnelle... Le "nous", si cher au coeur fut-il, ne devrait jamais se construire aux détriment des "je".

ppvfgdOpaa	Well, no dont bring it up right away.   I suggest getting together, hanging out...its sort of like youre hanging out with your best friends, except a little kissing and holding hands will be involved.  Just relax, stay cool, and just have fun in getting to know him.   Theres no rocket science when it comes to relationships really.    If you guys "click" then it just happens.   Dont bother reading all those magazines and crap, thats not reality.  <br>  <br>  If you guys should get into a conversation about dating or his exes, just say "I was always busy into other things, so I havent much experience in dating"  if he asks then you tell.   For now, if you blurt it out right there and then, he might think that you are desperate.  It really doesnt matter honey, what matters is how both of you work together.    Also, start out with the truth, about what ever it is.   Its not good to start a relationship based on lies.  Im not saying to tell him all your life's story, but just try not make things up to make yourself seem interesting. <br>  <br>  Good Luck, what is meant to be will be so dont stress it. |`|ar7o3d6uaa	lots of people will be the same you're not the only one....go with the flow...enjoy all the supprises....it'll be a good experience to try a new thing...most boys are different so  everytime you get and new boyfriend they might handle things different so you will have alot of supprises anyway|`|7dBBXfLiaa	I think you should come out and say everything.

"People say she is fat and look like a rat" Like what does that mean since people think she is despicable you might have a chance with her? Pretty low. Anyways the body language seems there might be something there. I wouldn't jump to conclusions though.

AA11350540	Maybe you are trying for the wrong kind of girls. You need to find girls who are secure with themselves and open minded and willing to give you a fair chance instead of the immature ones that are still unsure of who they are as people that like to play games or cannot make solid decisions and stick with them. Good Luck.|`|9f38db29a31bdd91f3bba66fada40705aa	Some of them are yes.

0vqaeP3Kaa	Guys of any religion are very similar, Mormons that seem "perfect" almost certainly have some fault too|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Any Mormon community would be delighted to have you visit - but be aware that you will be under immense pressure to convert.  Many Mormon parents do everything in their power to ensure their sons marry within the faith and actively discourage them dating non-Mormons.  I've had several Mormon friends in high school and through college, and have had Mormons as next-door neighbors.  One of the most attractive young women I ever met was a Mormon - a college freshman.  We dated (her  parents were in far-away Albuquerque while our college was at the other end of the state) and she was my first sexual conquest...but it soon became obvious that a permanent relationship was out of the question.  She wanted me and the experience, but not me as a husband.  Took me awhile to come to grips with that!  <br>  Which information should clue you: Mormons do not always take their stated faith and ethics seriously, any more than do other Protestant (or Roman Catholic) individuals.  Good luck in your quest - but go into it with your eyes wide open, so you don't get blindsided..|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Yes, I believe a Morman would be happy to be friends with a Christian. I would get on the LDS website and ask a few questions. Maybe they have some kids your age that could be a penpal or e-mail pal.|`|8Ak1FehYaa	First off mormons boys are not supose be dating outside their religion, unless they are trying to get you to fall in love with them and convert to their religion or they are jackmormons then yes they will convert and jackmormons tend to drink and swear and use drugs so their standards are differant then good mormon boys. mormon boys only marry in the temple to molly mormons and go on mission trips. So, I would not even be around a good mormon boy, they are a cult anyways, take it from one who was brought up to be a baby factory.|`|eN97evsYaa	no mormons stick to there religion! <br>  u just need to accept the guys around you. im christian and i do stupid stuff but im also very serious about my religion. i just like to have fun! <br>  and it's probably the same with these guys.|`|aSSXt6tlaa	Try joining a Mormon youth group.  Mormans are christians.  Mormon guys have their faults too.  If you are looking for perfection....Jesus dies over 2000 years ago.|`|v77RN9Yhaa	Of course they would be friends with you. They're friends with all types of people, no matter what their religion is. But if you think Mormon boys are mature and don't curse and blah blah blah, you got one think comin' because they're just like any other teenagers out there. I know this because I've known quite a few mormons myself. You could still try though. Good luck.<br>  <br>  To the girl towards the top who said something about mormons watch each other have sex on their wedding night, that's the FLDS you're talking about. Get your facts straight.|`|AA10295223	Boys are stupid in every faith.  They just are.  If you are not of a religion but you want to learn more about it I would tell you to ask for some of the mormon teachings, but as far as meeting a guy because of his religion?????  Not so much.  Take a deep breath and know that guys eventually grow up...some of them.  And good for you for knowing that who you are and what you want.  Keep looking, but don't convert.|`|0T3weRh5aa	You're 14 and too young to date in LDS standards<br>  You're invited to any LDS church close to you but you would need your parents permission since you're not 18 yet to join the church as a member.  You will have to remember LDS teens are just like any other teen except we don't do drugs, join gangs etc.|`|AA11631715	no hurry, take your time about boys and such. The Mormons are generally good folks, but they tend to stay in their religion when dating etc. Might consider exploring the religion if you're interested in that.|`|Xtqq71KGaa	the mormons are all about evangelism- i'm sure they would welcome someone interested in them and their brand of religion.|`|XO7Dmtlvaa	Find a church and join the youth program.|`|0utahjDCaa	Wow, you sound like a grandma not a 14 yr old.  it's just life have fun and be happy.|`|PJelxn5Xaa	I grew up mormon and let me tell you, depending on your location, chances are they will be ignorant and bias toward you or they will try to have you baptized within the week. Be aware that the entire religion is focused on converting. So if you are not comfortable with converting to mormonism I strongly recommend you avoid them until you are old enough to date. As you get older the boys you date will mature. You're only 14, you have a long way to go so don't sweat the small stuff. Also, the girl claiming you have to have someone watch you have sex on your wedding night is false. Mormons are just like everyone else, they just have strict rules and guidelines to follow. As i mentioned before, wait til you are older. Mormon guys can be really great if you can find one that is open minded.|`|W2qyu5zFaa	I knew a Mormon girl in high school and she would be friends with anyone. Even me, who wasn't that religious in high school. A Mormon boy would probably try to convert you to that church though, since that's what they are always trying to do. They knock on my door, like every week. Anyways, just ask your mom is you can go check it out. It's not a big deal.<br>  <br>  Oh and RLR's answer isn't true at all. They're wedding night is private like everyone else's and the believe in Heaven and Hell.|`|6Sj2mSKmaa	I am mormon and depending on your area there is usually a youth group that meets up on every wednesday as well as large dances and trips that you could become involved with. And as far as worrying about and LDS guy not liking you b/c of your religion i don't think that it would matter to them at all because you seem to have great values that go hand in hand with LDS. they don't judge other churches and are very easy going... hope this helps...|`|yNDauCKIaa	No offense to Mormons, but Mormons are weird. They have the strangest religion ever and they usually wear white shirts with black ties. They look weird, they are weird. I recommend you just search for normal Protestant boys instead. Good Protestant boys may be hard to come by, but it's worth the wait. Its WAY better to have a stupid Protestant boy than a good Mormon boy. Seriously. Mormons are just weird.|`|yZgxezOnaa	did you know that mormons are required to have people watch them have sex on their wedding night, and when they die...they believe they get their own planet? true story. i'd suggest church camp. or a youth group. but don't date them just because they're mormon, there's a lot of baggage in their beliefs and there are just as many that aren't serious about their religion.|`|lKc5FUbyaa	I like how you base your attraction to people on there religion.  There are all kinds of boys who are not christian who still have values and morals.  I suggest you look into getting involved with local youth organizations that have those values, volunteering etc. typically those type of people group up at those places :)|`|KYb41chjaa	i met a mormon guy on Espin one time, but im not sugesting that because meeting guys on the internet can be dangerous. go to a mormon church, not just for that reason but to get the sence of how someone else worships, and who knows mabe you'll meet a guy.|`|RNHrRiwsaa	Every wednesday is a day that the youth of the LDS church get together.  Show up.  They'll welcome you into the group. Just go to any church house belonging to the LDS church.|`|ZMTmdiv2aa	Just put an ad in the local newspaper, and title it SWF.  Or go to the Mormon events that they do.  They get crazy wild but in a good way of course.|`|MQHyQIlVaa	yeah they would be friends with you cuz they are friends with me and im not mormon which is crazy growing up in utah and not being mormon but i dunno move to utah lol or just try lookin on facebook or myspace.|`|5LTZj9Z1aa	use google.<br>  and try not to take life so seriously, you'll never make it out alive if you do.|`|MpzTnYhsaa	Move to Utah|`|HUft1lgPaa	I'm mormon. <br>  & I'm happily in a realtionship with this steadfast boy (also a mormon) as of 5 months now.<br>  With no serious fights, no breaks, no sex, drugs or alchol peer presure, and no break ups.<br>  Mormon boys are good choices.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I met him at  a youth conference our church had, It's kinda like camp but better.<br>  Boys have to ask girls to dance and so many boys ask you.<br>  He was one of those boys and we ended up having alot in common, so we talked and exchanged numbers and facebooks and three days later we were in a great relationship.<br>  <br>  <br>  But for it to work, you would have to have the same values as him.<br>  <br>  <br>  So, yeah dances and youth conferences is what you need to go to.
4RNDZ0Kwaa	WOW!  You may need to address the issue that this is bothering you. Its eating you that she thinks you are ok with it.  Once you confront her..it will slowy go away. Trust me|`|af2457c870be9622a6ab8dae585e8216aa	You said it, the past is the past. If you can't get over it then obviously you have some issues here. How would you feel if you did something she couldn't get over? It is not fair AT all to judge your significant other based on their past, there is nothing she or you can do to change it and worrying about it and stressing it is not going to make it go away. If you honestly can't get past it maybe she isn't the girl for you. It could also maybe be whatever it is, you have a fear she will repeat these things? (i.e cheating) I wouldn't suggest talking to her about this because I guarantee you are going to really upset her because she can't change her past. Good Luck|`|WuWX0BBBaa	I know exactly how you feel. You just try to look at her for the currect person she is right now, but, you can't help the past entering your mind, which is something we all go through, unfortunately. Just look at her for who she is at the moment, and know that she's a better person then she was back then; mainly, because of you being in her life and helping her find something that is much better for her going forward.|`|1uf6MuSyaa	If she's the best for you, you be honnnnest with yourself and be straight with her, if you both can tell each other these things you both can work it out. I feel alot of feelings for her from you so snap outta it and go with your heart.|`|sZ5cXXslaa	unfortunately you're gonna remember her past forever,  only time can tell when it goes away and whether you put the effort in to block out her past.  good luck.  if you say she's the best you've ever been with, let it slide

That is a great gift to give telling someone you like them more then a friend.  Hope she feels the same.  Take a chance, if she feels the same way you both could get a present on her birthday.  |`|5c3c1add2bad036bd45fade4f66d367faa	i think you should get her diamonds (a girls best friend) lol but no personly i dnt like neither one of those try sumthin diffrent <br>  how bout makin her somethin (no kiddy cards) lyke a strapbook of yall past 2 years but leave pages empty so u can tell her yall can fill up the pages together lol (cheesy, i kno) but it jus may work and she might lyke it    |`|NOV7KxXuaa	The bracelet!

BDBoZYlRaa	Yes, it's absolutely true. It is a good thing to "love" yourself first - get to know yourself. Appreciate what you do. Everyone is special and contributes great things to this world if we chose to do so. My advice to you would write 10 things you are grateful for about yourself.. and 10 things you are grateful for in your life. <br>  Also whenever insecurty thoughts get in the way.. make a neg side and a pos on a sheet of paper. For every neg thought, write a pos one.. i think you will find you can think of more pos than neg. And maybe not see a psychiatrist first, but see a therapist - they can help you unearth unconscious feelings.. it actually is a strength to be wanting to get help for yourself, so don't view it as a weakness if you decide to go. Also i think the reason that you feel you love others more, is because you ego/subconscious what have you, is reaching out for your attention. It wants to feel loved and you aren't giving yourself enough credit and love - so i would suggest you try to work on it! I think you'll do great! :D|`|J62anGqkaa	YES so Love urself gal! no one can tell u better than u urself. u don't need a psychiatrist gal. just go to a fashion councellor and see what she cant do to help u improve ur image---this will give some confidence. also do things that are a lil challenging or whatever that gives u the thrill. <br>  <br>  In life you will realise that the people you meet have a purpose,<br>  Some were put there to test you,<br>  Some would use you,<br>  Some would teach you, and <br>  Some would bring out the better if not the best in you.<br>  Some may even cause you pain n heartache <br>  but one must learn to move on.<br>  So pray for the people who can't treat you right,<br>  and thank God for those who love you back and see your worth.<br>  <br>  Have a nice day. God loves you! |`|qdVWp6X5aa	ABSOLUTELY. How can you expect anyone to love you, if even YOU don't love you. Obviously easier said than done...<br>  <br>  I have found therapy to be very helpful in talking about these sort of issues |`|vBM2kn94aa	You should seek professional help so you can get past this.<br>  <br>  Yes you need to have love for yourself first before you can truly give love to someone.|`|kJSEiQN3aa	Yeah, you must love yourself before you can someone who will love you. Why? If you love yourself, then that means you have confidence and if you that, you will be desirable. |`|ccfb71afaac5d79b06639126ff012c31aa	i completly agree. if you start loving someone before you love yourself, you begin to put their needs and wants above your own. which is good to think of others, but in reality, you need to do whats best for you. and if that means seeing a psychiatrist in hopes to figure out who you are as a person, and come to terms with that, theres nothing wrong in asking for help.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	Yep.  It's completely true.  No one else can substitute for what you lack in yourself, and you cannot be an equal partner if you are just a mass of insecurities.  You will drive everyone away from you, and just suck the life out of every room you walk into.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your treatment.

Because it's an obvious sign that I did my job, not only right, but damn good. Think about it, she would have to be so in to what the two of you are doing, and enjoying it so much that all she could do is grip down and hold on for the ride of her life. Simply put, That's just a sign of one hell of a pipe layer. LOL!|`|G3bzZzP2aa	It would annoy me if it hurt. Whether she meant to do it or not it still hurts.

Use small 10-15 feet length ropes, rather than one big one to avoid slack.<br>  <br>  Why are you trying to get loose anyway? It's more fun to stay tied up.|`|a3fbdb6faea012e068b2199e10f1e570aa	handcuffs!!!!|`|e5XU1GpAaa	As a Dom, I would say that you should get some serious bondage books and let her tie you up. if you want more in depth suggestions contact me on myspace at www.myspace.com/eaglefeathers59|`|ecbd643abcc7d61768c9b405a9813645aa	get cuffs!|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	The symbolism is what counts. Whether you can get loose is beside the point.|`|Li7cuT7caa	let her be the man and feed you well and let her do it everything for your needs! at the end of the day..whats the point! you will still slip like a leech!
Rmz23cCzaa	There should be some compatibility between the two partners, in what they like. If not, life will become very frustrating in the end. But some compromises are required too.<br>  <br>  And yes, for me my love of bondage was one of the big reasons I hit it off with my current bf. <br>  <br>  As for dating: it's a random process. Chances that a person is into bondage are small, 10% maybe. However, for a woman to get a man interested in bondage will be much easier than the other way around.|`|50e73b4d9badf5a9a27b87c727a69885aa	NOPE, to each his own....anything goes behind closed doors.|`|AA11107963	Its a really sensitive subject because bondage is taking an intimate and sweet act and incorporating something painful or submissive.  If you are looking to be involved in bondage when taking part in a relationship, you should probably find someone with the same lifestyle choices prior to getting intimate.  That way you find what you are looking for and your significant other doesn't get an interesting surprise.|`|p6hININ9aa	I think it depends on how much focus you place on it, and your fetishes.  Communication definately helps in discovering if your partner shares similar interests.  Although BDSM can be a lifestyle for some, for others it can just be a occasional way to shake up the bedroom scene.  If you and your partner can agree on how often and when to play, you should fare okay.  Good Luck and happy scening|`|sIenIL0caa	You should really read this free E-book containing 97 steps to a happy relationship. highly recommended!|`|3e342b4c35254658976e2faf3d9365f0aa	If you are "into" the same things.|`|XyXPCZMAaa	I suppose the more bizarre of a fetish you've got, the more unlikely you are to find someone you love who'll do it. I guess it depends if by 'bondage' you mean handcuff to the bed OR like hanging from the ceiling with a system of ropes and pulleys and stuff like I've seen on the internet.

Rmz23cCzaa	Depends by whom really.<br>  <br>  By a burglar: on a comfy chair; by a policemen: with the  hand cuffs he reserves for his wife; by an Indian: to a tree; by you: in a hogtie.<br>  <br>  And finally by my lover: in a spread eagle tie.

Rmz23cCzaa	I have been put in a ball tie a few times, a tie with your legs folded and knees against the breast. The arms are crossed before the legs or tied on the back.<br>  <br>  I think those ties were a little bit more constricting than hogties.

She won't be able to resist.|`|N7mgfDxnaa	shes probably just having an off day. or maybe shes shy.|`|cxVmq2kraa	She's very stressed.<br>  If your standing near her sometime or are saying hi maybe just gently ask her if shes okay.<br>  She'll appractice it and if she gets defensive and asks "Why are you asking?" just say that you wanted to make sure that she was okay since she seemed upset.<br>  I think she wants to be friends right now because of stress but theres defentally a chance!|`|2P4q7Kyjaa	She won't always feel like talking or flirting if she's stressed or worried about something. Try not to take it too personally, it might not be anything to do with you, and if it was something you had done she would have told you about it.<br>  <br>  If she carries on like this, talk to her about it.

Là, ce n'est de la faute de personne, c'est juste comme ?a... Mais malheureusement, ?a donne de longues soirées "chat" qui au final n'ont servis à rien.<br>  <br>  Et finalement, tu finis par en trouver une (enfin "un" dans ton cas !) qui te correspond enfin.

AA11903338	I'd say they are going pretty well. Playing hard to get is sort of a defense mechanism girls use to deflect crappy guys. If you are a nice sweet guy then just keep being that way. Eventually if she really like you then she will change her mind about staying single. (hopefully)
nbYqljSGaa	It's definitely a good thing!!!  Sounds like he's interested in you!|`|M63kq3AYaa	He means he finds something fascinating about you, that he doesn't see in the girls around him.<br>  <br>  It's a good thing.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  So, it could be your clothes that he likes, skin tone, hair or maybe the shape of your eye sockets which is normal if one of you happen to be Asian (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, or from any of those countries that have similar skull formations). Yes, it might seem shallow, but if there wasn't some part of your body a partner liked, that would be a problem.|`|7OCrraCpaa	Depends on the context of how he put it. Exotic is for like animals and dancers.|`|cHKhB6ijaa	When a guy says it .It''s a complement becuz exoticn many people are like gorgeous.

RiYcDPfEaa	You don't just ask someone to be your gf.  That's illogical pressure.  It just happens when the time is right.  Pressuring her will push her away.|`|BJe74zEBaa	Paul, you are now at an age where you need to become a man.  These thoughts and querries are acceptable up until you are a senior in high school.  Once you are out, you need to understand some things.<br>  <br>  1.  You are a man.  Act like one.  If you are worried about chic crap like how much you and she are 'investing' in the relationship, you need to make some personal changes or start dating guys.<br>  <br>  2.  Own the relationship.  women like a chase.  They like a man that carries himself with confidence.  Treat her with respect, but make meaningful decisions and stop sweating the small stuff.  If she can see that you are following her around like a lost puppy dog, she'll get bored.  Don't be afraid to stop calling her.  Just stop calling her.  I guarantee you that after a week she'll come knocking on your door.  Women hate being ignored... on the other hand, if she doesn't call, then great... move on... there are other women out there.<br>  <br>  3.  You seem very inexperienced in relationships..  That's okay, but just know that the best part about being young is that you should have many relationships. Be confident and be happy... the rest will come to you.|`|6ctEaEvqaa	If its been 3 months and she has even begun to open up at all, then probably :( Its all about whether or not your happy. Think about it|`|7633fb6dd15a1316f3aff2222e6239f1aa	i'd suggest talking to her if you can, face to face is best but if you're concerned then you need to bring it up. Hopefully you'll find a resolve maybe not the one you may want but it may be better for both of you. She maybe distancing herself because this is how she protects herself from getting hurt ie; the past bad relationship. if she feels comfortable talking about it ask her, if she isn't then obviously the pain of that memory is still fresh and offer her a comforting way out of this relationship. it may be too soon for her to be in a relationship and it is not fair for you to be walking on eggshells. <br>  <br>  Hope everything works out.|`|CMAhU1gQaa	Girls are like this give her time ask her does she want a relationship and ask her does she truly love you??? <br>  <br>  or ask her do you me to back off???<br>  <br>  ask her that??|`|F9ahxUbUaa	It sounds like she is probably really still scared to be in a relationship at this point in her life. She likes you, but is so scared that if she takes it there with you, she probably will become a worry wart about anything that can go wrong in that relationship. She is distant because she probably does not have the emotional energy right now to express her feelings any further. She's trying not to hurt your feelings, but is also probably feeling bad that she is hurting your feelings because she is not responding to you as she think she should be. She has some problems she need to work out in her life probably, and she doesn't want to bring that baggage on you. If I were you, I would just make one more call to say you were calling just to check up on her to see if she is doing okay. If she doesn't answer, leave her  a message saying that, and just do not attempt to call anymore. You calling her more and her not returning those calls would make her feel even worse because for whatever reason shes not picking up the phone, its making her feel bad.  Good luck.
2887544a9688b33e1ebb1a4e3397d4e9aa	perhaps you were once the second choice, but now you're the first choice, aren't you? if you're not the first choice now, then leave him. ask him, am I your first choice now? do you have any regrets?<br>  <br>  a friend of mine was crazy about a woman for years and they tried to make it work but she was always running away and coming back and running away again. then he met another woman who he loved in a different way - not so passionately - but he told me that at least she and him were a team and were reliable together. which is what he always wanted. now they have a daughter together and they're really happy. sometmes the first choice doesn't always lead to happiness and it really does depend on what you want. you can love someone madly but it may not work. so don't worry about feelings of once being the second choice. time will tell. true love doesn't always go in straight lines and takes time to grow. if you're happy together now in the present, that's the important thing.|`|AA12172198	Hmm, if he's on the rebound and using you for his own amusement, then get the hell out of there!    However, if he's suddenly seen the light and realised that you're the one he's wanted all along, then you should sit back and be happy.  You just need to find out which one it is!!??!!  That's the hard bit!|`|PlscvZNnaa	for my side,of course most doesnt want to be the second choice...but y there is a mistress...yah they know that this man/girl  love them tho..there is a 1st one before them...as the saying LOVE is BLIND...even they know its wrong still they continue...and your case is this man/girl still going with the first1 if yes...forget it..move on try to have some one who deserve u and u deserve be the number 1 and only one.because at any time may be she/he will dump u..good luck|`|dYnHUa7baa	 Depends...If you are second to her kids then yes, until you are a family proper then you would just have to accept that. If you are second to a male friend then no way in hell! Make like a shepard (get the flock out of there!)...Second to her girlie friends then that is something that will change the longer you are together and the closer you get. My girlfriend of seven years is my best friend now and I am hers.|`|gFSbxePJaa	If you have nothing else going in your love life except that, what's the harm in staying?  Don't put all of your eggs in that basket and keep your heart open to better things, but the first choice person and the memory of them WILL slowly fade and you will become a first choice in time. If the second place position is accompanied by emotional abuse, then you have to ditch the relationship, but if you can handle your situation as it is today, there is a possibility it can get better.|`|v0FyQB1Aaa	You should never be satified with being second best you are worth more than that. If he cannot love you the way you deserve to be loved then he does not deserve you at all.<br>  Have the courage of you convictions you know if the relationship feels right!

2887544a9688b33e1ebb1a4e3397d4e9aa	find out if she REALLY wants to marry you. if she does, and you really want to marry her, go and visit her parents and tell them of your wishes and be prepared to answer their objections, like money and so forth. that would show them that you've got guts and strength of character. if they still say no, and your gf doesn't want to disobey them, then all I can say is better luck next time. good luck whatever you choose to do.|`|HAk6iROaaa	Parents cannot expect you to do everything they say, is their love conditional?

lckv4hs3aa	What did he say as to why he broke up with you? Maybe it was just bad timing for a relationship and is something that has nothing to do with you. For example my boyfriend (well ex) had to break up recently as we're 8000 miles apart for the next year or so as we both have things in life we want to do. It was the hardest decision and we still broke uo even though we were/are madly in love. Still tell each other how we miss and thinking about each other. Unfortunatly it's just bad timing and best to stay friends for a while.|`|QYXAqW8maa	People often make a distinction between loving someone and "being" in love with someone. Your ex is probably just trying to say that he still cares for you.<br>  But if he broke up with you then you should begin to move on.

Either way it could be that the foreplay is so intense that she's ready for actual intercourse. Some men feel that their sexual motto is "Dive right in." Whereas some women feel you should "preheat" the oven before you stick the turkey in. <br>  <br>  Believe me, there is nothing you can do to help them out. Their relationship is already crumbling when one of the two partners are fulfilling their needs outside of the relationship.|`|8yxS91Xaaa	She needs a change so she had to pretend to like foreplay.|`|AoRxuOqMaa	It could be that she is more comfortable with you, meaning since she is use to her bf being that way, that  now it  kind of feels odd or uncomfortable when they do have foreplay, or when she tries to got that route. Since you were open to it from the get, she now has the sexual freedom to either have foreplay or  skip it and just have sex.|`|AdY8cgCgaa	I am not a lady but then English is not a languange you speak.<br>  Best answer I saw was leave her alone.<br>  A big penis is not an answer, you can do just fine with a norrmal male appendage.<br>  The chick sounds as if she has a sex issue, you sure your the only one besides her boyfriend (bf)? <br>  Remember you have sex with everyone she does STD's and all.|`|MZXneQmAaa	You are better, you make her feel more comfortable.|`|VGNM1MfWaa	its your choice|`|VxhvgjA1aa	The reason is each human being has an indivudual pheromone, A pheromone is any chemical or set of chemicals produced by a living organism (humans) that transmits a message to other members of the same species. There are alarm pheromones, food trail pheromones, SEX pheromones, and many others that affect behavior or physiology. so this basically means that without realising it we are attracted to some from a subconcious scent, for instance you may find someone who you thinks the hottest person alive but when it comes to having sex he/she does nothing for you the reason i know this is bcas i had it happen to me and i dint understand why i found him so attractive but didnt want to have sex with him.|`|aC6MHjVjaa	if you want to help the dude out just stop f*cking his girl! let them figure things out on their own!|`|aWF8X7WYaa	Dont ask this kind of stuff to total strangers, you cotton headed ninny muggins.|`|bTOPnUVKaa	sounds to me like she has fallen out of love with her boyf and likes you a lot. often when a relationship is bad, you dont have any desire to sleep with your partner. but then if meet someone hot, you cant wait to sleep with them.|`|eT7frSXSaa	"hey dude ive been having sex with your gf and i wanna help you guys out" What a toatal retard.

South Carolina is one of those states that does.  Contact an attorney.|`|c720f18d5ff47be9e8559720adf278ceaa	All states are different.  Generally you receive cs after age 18 if the child attends secondary education (college, trade school); however, they have to be enrolled in so many hours a semester and have to produce grade cards to show they are putting forth effort.  You loose child support after the age of 18 if the child gets married, is self providing or joins the military.<br>  <br>  The best thing to do is call an attorney for a consultation.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

If you don't have a wife or GF... and see has sent you pictures and you like what your seeing.... then go for it.... but, remember, until you actually meet her or are the one taken the pictures...she could be someone or something totally different......  This happened to me once, when I was single.......  A lady told me all about herself.... how nice of a figure she had, slim tight body... huge breasts, etc. etc.... Well, when we met, she did in fact have huge breasts...but most 300lbs woman do...... she was so ugly, that it was beyond belief....... and apparently so horny...... she was trying to start something right there at the table.....  So, be careful and if your married or have a gf...... I'd really be thinkin.....|`|OfBTAX8raa	Scam dude.  Sound like a scam.  Leave her alone and don't contact her.  I know it may be hard cause you have established a relationship.  Another thing is yeah she sends you photos, but you don't know if that's the same woman that's emailing you.  <br>  <br>  Meet women the old fashion way: Church, Jazz club, weddings, through a friend, supermarket etc.  Don't trust the internet especially if they're not from this country.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  God Bless and good luck.|`|c67834b2cd2e1dac076e88eb79238b04aa	I wouldn't respond to her. Mark her e-mails as spam and stop opening them. You never know what people will pull on you.|`|4sMiJZNSaa	i think u should ask her and see what happens <br>  who knows|`|65kdMsCFaa	either its a prank, spam, virus, or some dumb bimbo who got the wrong email. try responding to her?|`|maRRISSLaa	yea I think u should just either email her and tell her she's got the wrong guy or spam her. she may be looking for a hand out or a place to live or citizenship.|`|AuYYMzhmaa	You could respond to her, if you want to. Just be friends, there's no bad thing. Try talking how'd she got your e-mail, or why she talks to you. Just try but be careful.|`|XYQQNUGeaa	She's looking to become a U.S. citizen!  Has she already told you she loves you?  Careful!!!|`|Y1pbEVGXaa	it sounds cool to me i wish i was in the same boat as you lol and if when she does come over just be carefull of your belongings|`|g3xMSQzJaa	id call the cops and hand it to them i mean,many people get raped from these kinds of things
2887544a9688b33e1ebb1a4e3397d4e9aa	there will ALWAYS be people who get on your nerves. that goes for everyone. best to learn to get along if you can't avoid them. but there are limits. like when someone behaves in an unacceptable way. seeing the diffference between your feelings and whether something is objectively unacceptable is something everyone has to learn.
2d3c22ce4985a486c431f75390b17331aa	OK, tell him you just went to the doctors because your having pain in your hands.... tell him the Dr. said it's carpal tunnel, caused from texting and you need to stop for about a week... tell him you'd still like to communicate during that time and give him your #'s|`|IdLkoT3faa	If u want him 2, give him ur # and let him know u'd rather talk then text. Tell him u like his voice or something if ur serious that u want him 2 call.|`|N9kH0Srnaa	He probably lacks confidence and sending a text gives him chance to think out what he's going to say.|`|PQs6WwtDaa	You cannot get someone to call you. He is a coward.|`|jEbctBAKaa	u send him a MSG " i want to talk to u don't be shy this is my right "
2d3c22ce4985a486c431f75390b17331aa	If you were invited...then you should have went.... Can't say what all happening at clubs now... It's been about 6 years since I've gone to one but, back then it was NOT uncommon to see couples in there..... In fact, I seem the couples take seats right up next to the stage..... and the ladie, dollar tip the dancer.....  So, not sure what all your bf is trying to hide, if anything...  maybe he's just shy, when it comes to being around naked ladies and having you there.... The wildest thing that normally happens is a table dance, which is back in a corner and the dancer, rubs and dances on the person..(1 on 1)  and they are very strict, as to what they can anad can't do.....  really nothing that wild......  Just tell him.... he can go where he wants and you can go where you want.... then hit a few of the girls dance places that feature male dancers... and/or hit a couple of strip clubs on your own and see what it's about.....  One thing, if he gettin all he wants at home.... I can't see a need to go to a club......|`|Z5iX8sjsaa	do you want to keep him? For gosh sakes let him have a night out with his buddies. get over it|`|46eed43362ec3d686dc6a4ead0f7e7b8aa	I love when my wife goes with me and get lap dances.  That is SUCH a turn on.  No sex goes on...but a fun stripper can make the experience wonderful...I don't even want to go without the wife at this stage in my life.  I have a woman, I just want fantasy now...|`|KnBrgBe5aa	It's relatively common for men to go to strip clubs and if they do, it's usually to unwind and get away from it all.<br>  <br>  People that take their girlfriends or wives are usually tourists to that particular area, most locals do not tend to do that, furthermore, unless you are a lesbian, I can't imagine what you would want to be doing in a place full of naked women anyway OTHER than harrass and scrutinize your boyfriend, rarely if ever does a woman actually go to enjoy herself with her man to a place like that.<br>  <br>  This is a problem of your own insecurity, and if I were him, I would be the one leaving YOU, not the other way around.<br>  <br>  If you want to "know" what happens at strip clubs you must be very dense or immature. Since you didn't give an age, I'm going to assume based on your write up, that you were in your late teens.<br>  <br>  My advice is: Grow up, some maturity goes a long way...|`|WCfacymaaa	He probably thinks that you will get jealous of the dancers and then you would prevent him from having a good time. And yes couples go to strip clubs all the time. <br>  <br>  My advice just let it go and let him go and have a good time with his friends.|`|ipcxUQBWaa	my bf always wanted me to go with when i finaly went it was fun nothing speacial now i do shows for him in the bedroom much like at the strip club|`|LXHG7Tvwaa	yes some couples really do go there together and I think that is perfectly reasonable... especially if your friend invited both of you and not just him.  As to what really goes on there, that is a harder question to answer.  Most strip clubs are just a good way to spend a lot of money on something that you (for a guy) could and should have your girlfriend do for you.  If he is not wanting you to go, chances are that he is not wanting you to see him enjoying himself with mostly naked women.  I don't blame you for not trusting him.  Even though chances are good that absolutely nothing will happen, if he doesn't want you to go then he is hoping that something will happen.|`|gw3Rj2aHaa	He's obviously uncomfortable with the idea of you going with him.  Chances are he wouldn't act the same way with you there as he would alone or with guy friends.  Most strip clubs don't allow touching so you probably have nothing at all to worry about as far as the girls are concerned.  What I would worry about is why he's not comfortable sharing this with you.  I've gone to many strip clubs with men, and have had a great time.  Even had a lap dance or two.  The men I went with were perfectly comfortable with me there and went out of their way to make sure I had a good time.
2d3c22ce4985a486c431f75390b17331aa	What goes around..........Comes around....... Don't like the taste of your own medicine... get a grip, you don't call her and you list excuses.... she doesn't call you and your wondering whats going on and are looking for advice.  You should have called her,,,, you didn't so she moved on..... Most likely found someone on Weds. after you didn't call.... and that person is calling her, showing they are interested...... you snooz, you looz|`|jZEKjltJaa	I know I've felt really let down by guys before in the earliest stages of relationships and you kinda just end up thinking- whats the point? And it's so much easier to let go now then put heaps of effort in trying to make it work. I bet she's thinking you just don't care enough to chase her so she's showing she doesnt care right back at ya!

That normally tells them whats on your mind......

Sorry to say....|`|3m8JgWj1aa	i hate to say this but there may be something more, when i was with my guy and we were in a serious relationship my ex came around, mind you i never lied to my boyfriend but my relationship didn't last much longer after my ex and i became friends again. ask if you and your ex can hang out, also see if it can be all THREE of you guys because that's the only way you can be sure|`|m1TQuVkmaa	i would definatly be suspicious. sounds like she still likes him.|`|NqiwIvxUaa	If she thinks you're going to be mad when you haven't been before - she may be feeling guilty about not telling you everything.

I don't like lips that are so big they suffocate me, but I want to be able to feel them at least a little. When they are on the smaller side, they are more fun to nibble and stuff. I'm not a fan of carp lips.

i3SJRRrgaa	I am in the Exact same situation. I was never like this before, and I used to pity the girls that are controlling and jealous all the time, because I was never This in love with anyone before. Now, I have become the jealous controlling monster that I've always pitied other girls for. I'm a step ahead of you, because my boyfriend and I are currently on a break (because I've been extremely possessive and insecure). When he's not around, I automatically think he's doing something bad (which he never did). Even when he's treating me really nicely, I still think he has a motive. The worst thing is I DO realize I have a problem, but I can't change it....I tried to let it go but now I can't even sleep at night. <br>  <br>  I tried to lower my expectations and not care so much, but that's just not working.. How can anyone control how in love you are with someone?<br>  <br>  I can't help you at all, but I just want to let you know that you're not the only one... I'm desperate for help too...|`|mHofVZgRaa	first i understand your feeling. you have been with him forever and i think that you just really love him. and i think that you are only doing that so you can love him even more. its a natural stage. everyone goes through that stage with someone. later on youll eventually accept the fact that you need to trust him and that he loves you back. that way your relationship will blossom even more. BTW youre not pathetic.|`|NyyBYZhtaa	Hmmm. well maybe you should let him go. Maybe youve been going out too long. Maybe hes not the right one...|`|7UNxSYhaaa	well, just start first thing is to lower your pain by lowering your expectations. 4 years is not that long but its still something to CELEBRATE and be proud of ....you guys lasted more than many marriages last !! its a great selfassurance for you to keep and restore for thinking how strong you are how powerful your commitment is.<br>  <br>  now ....keep your expectations a little low for now !! Accept whats going on ! and look for solutions to the problem. Stop focusing on how bad its going ..look back ...take some time and space .... pay attention to your health, sleep, exercise and body signs. Also... just accept that there will be some sacrifices required to be happy and keep the ones you love ! <br>  <br>  after this hopefully things will start to change slowly.  Be proactive !
AA10428869	he will probably start spending more time with her; it only seems logical because he wants to get to know her better. as far as him hanging out with a bunch of girls maybe he's just trying to figure out what he likes or how they really act. i mean would you want to be romantically involved with someone that you couldnt just hang out with as a friend? it has to start somewhere. by the way its 2008 it is ok for a girl to ask out a guy for coffee, movie, walk me home, whatever.|`|DHEUxcHKaa	guys can be attracted to many many woman at once, and even if they become your bf they will still feel around for other woman until he knows that your the one. if your just starting to date there are probably 5 other girls hes interested in and talking to. Usually when a guy likes you at the beinging depending on how old you are they will try talking to you more, laughing alot. usually more loud and obnoxious.|`|OwgU3VVdaa	umm.. when my boyfriend first starting showing interest in me he asked for my myspace, made polite conversation and asked me if I wanted to hang out later.
AA11621397	You need to focus on these feelings and yourself and trying to heal yourself. You seem to carry alot of pain and hurt with you. You need to realize that the past was the past and to start fresh you need to let go and think from a new perspective. Try to find something fun to do with your mom or perhaps try to get in a deep conversation with her so you can express your feelings.|`|3i9FroPtaa	I used to suffer from depression, and I too resented everyone for not noticing how I felt. However, there came a point when I noticed that I needed to move on from that. Try to talk to her and ask her how SHE feels about the whole situation and how or why she never noticed what was going on with you. You may find some answers that surprise you. Take a day, just the two of you and just talk and get everything out into the open.|`|7af1ce822fc88bd4a890b9a52e6c5bf7aa	If you work on yourself and your own feelings you'll come to a point where you suddenly realize you don't resent your mother any more.   The key is to stop worrying about other people and work on yourself, because you are the only one you can change.|`|f606edb0943ae9c1da13cb6363413af8aa	if you hid your depression, you shouldn't resent someone for not noticing|`|28eea98fddd54ae673d51f8522541419aa	I was in a very similar situation when I was younger and I was extremely resentful of my mother for not seeing that something was wrong with me.  Even though I tried very hard to hide the way I was feeling from everyone. I thought that if she really loved me she would see that something was wrong and do something to help me.  <br>  But now that my children are teenagers I realize that as much as they may love you --mothers just aren't psychic.   We are not always able to pick up on a child's feelings. Especially when they are teenagers and are pushing away from you anyway.  They tell you to leave them alone and remembering when you were a teenager you try to give them some space.  Hoping that if they really need you they will open up to you.<br>  Sometimes it seems that with teenagers you ae damned if you do and damned  if you don't. .My best advice is to actually sit down and talk to her about how you feel.   That is the only way I was able to let go of my resent ment.
AA11621397	Love I believe gives you balance and meaning to this crazy thing we call life. It gives us a chance to feel something and have an enduring bond with another person. It's like sharing your life with another individual--a partnership. Love is a beautiful thing to be shared either with lovers, friends, family and portrays the more humane side of humanity.|`|YAsNd5eQaa	because it makes you feel good about yourself, its a part of you that you can connect with someone else, its just something natural that you have that you cant control : ]|`|88izsPb1aa	Cause without it life would be boring with little pleasures.|`|ZWcr5yaTaa	Because without it you will feel alone and unwanted|`|zl9zbhDKaa	I've been trying to figure that out.<br>  When you know, can you tell me?<br>  Thanks.|`|f1fb42b88672a085f7df6e707ed21f4eaa	Love doesn't make the world go 'round...<br>  Love makes the ride worthwhile.|`|eDdJxvCEaa	coz d-uh without it life would be loveless?|`|NbJPW0Smaa	why be capable of emotions if we arent meant to have them

I think it should be after a girl has gone to college, worked and lived on her own for awhile, traveled a bit, hung out with friends, partied and actually got to experience life on  her own.  After that she will more than likely be ready to settle down and get married.  I suppose that is about mid to late twenties.|`|rT43plWoaa	After you finish college or have at least worked for a minimum of five years and you have to have found the person that makes you feel like you are the most magical person in the world and like that nothing matter except for you and that person. <br>  <br>  You must share interests but also have respect for the other person's interests if they are different from yours. You must respect each others family and at the same time the family must have respect for you as well.|`|VQkKUBMyaa	There is no standard answer.   She should have lived a bit first - travelled, studied, worked, saved etc.    She should make sure she knows what she is getting into first and be able to stand on her own two feet in case it doesn't work.|`|DGHatVsZaa	well my dad says he'll get me married when i'm 21 to 23....<br>  <br>  please please please answer my question:<br>  <a href="http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080708045905AAA1ky7&pa=FYd1D2bwHTHzJb9jFeI4RTBpx8NlhYG4SMZtJkhB8nL5Sw--&paid=asked&msgr_status=">http://in.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|kVvCTP9haa	GIRLS should NEVER get married. Women on the other hand should get married when they're damn good and ready. There should never be some kind of time frame when it comes to marriage. It happens when it's right. Oh and medical science doesn't say 18 THE LAW says 18!|`|suFnSiXwaa	you should get married when you think you are ready for the responsability........and/or when you think you are with the right person.............I don't think that goes by age.|`|NejOrZFkaa	i think 15 good age cuz u can have babys at young age and b there friend and stuff.

026407cde2bc8691b34593dbabae7e6eaa	So what's the question?  Both of you appear to be doing what your therapists are asking you to do.  Sounds like they might be right on.  A little bit of codependency seems to be going on here.  Always live for yourself first.  The rest follows.|`|DqU8Ax83aa	Wow, both of you in therapy over a realtionship.  Maybe it's just me, but if I was in a relationship that drove me crazy enough to seek counseling, I would take that as a clue that it's not the right match.  But, I can tell you're far from ready to let go, so I don't know what you expect from this site.  Good luck with that.
71VRvldJaa	I say good on you!  Enjoy your freedom.....you have lots of years to have girlfriends and be in relationships and get married.  You're not doing yourself or a girl any favour if you're dating her or going with her and you really don't want to be doing that.<br>  You'll know when you're ready to date..........perhaps you'll end up a bachelor and never date..........and there's nothing wrong with that.  Too many people hook up with people they really don't want to be with because it's the expected thing to do!<br>  You have to be true to yourself!|`|8rbQBaIeaa	Of course it happens, and is normal. You have a long future ahead of you. Take the tiger by the tail and be who you want to be. Then one day, if the right girl comes along, you will be more prepared for your future together|`|9PmVVQziaa	Oh that happens!  You're only 17!  What's the rush?  In fact, I have a 35 yr old brother and 36 yr old cousin who are not in relationships either.   They just do their own thing.  FREEDOM!<br>  <br>  You may decide later on down the road that you'd like to get serious.  Or the right lady will come along and you want to be with her.  But until then enjoy your life!  <br>  <br>  Or perhaps you never want a serious relationship...and that's okay too!  It's better you KNOW what's for you instead of getting caught up in a relationship that makes you miserable.|`|AA11621397	No everyone it's different. It's good you should wait till your mature and ready to have a relationship not go on 'what your friends think'. It's a personal decision. Your taking your time and being wise about being in a relationship.|`|N28zLxtpaa	Totally normal.
SI59QO0raa	It's important for you both to be happy whether thats together or apart.  It does sounds like you need a break.  Stear away from drama though, learn how to pick your battles.  Keep the friends and family out of your relationship, you two need to decide whats best for both of you.|`|026407cde2bc8691b34593dbabae7e6eaa	sometimes you stay together because it's easier than breaking up.  and just because you break up on a bad note doesn't mean it always stays that way.  time heals all wounds and all that.  but fighting is harmful if you are doing a lot of it.  take a walk or find a quiet spot to do some hard thinking.|`|zniTFxebaa	Take her out to dinner then to a movie. She will like it because she will feel that you really like her. Just because her friends say to dump her does not mean you have to. Stay together if it is really what you two want to do. I hope this helped.<br>  <br>  -Tara|`|AA12363568	All you can really do is be yourself, be sensitive to her and her emotions, other than that, you shouldn't have to do anything. She should be respecting you as well. You sound like you really want this to work. Good for you, she is lucky!|`|MnPMEAZLaa	Well, if you are under the age of 25 sounds like maybe you both need to grow up more and being together will hinder this.  If you are under 25 and don't have a 4 year degree go back to school.<br>  <br>  If you are already established in your adult life then try these steps.<br>  <br>  1) Sit across from each other at a table <br>  2) She talks for 15mins - you say nothing until she is done - then repeat what she said so you understand it but don't answer her.<br>  3) you say what you want for 15mins.  only stick to 1 or 2 topics NO MORE - then she repeats what you said so you know you are heard.<br>  <br>  The next day you will give each other your answers this way you both were heard and then you both will have time to think of the mature way to respond.<br>  <br>  Stay away from saying "you" and "always" these words used can start fights.<br>  <br>  Get right with God.  He is your Creator and knows you best.<br>  <a href="http://nad.hopetalk.org/" rel="nofollow">http://nad.hopetalk.org/</a>
GzL8X6vTaa	Give him some time and don't push it. If he loves you he will be there, try to be understanding. I would do some detective work though like make sure that there isn't some other girl involved. But take it easy remember what you have here may be good but there could always be better around the corner.|`|ccfb71afaac5d79b06639126ff012c31aa	idk, that would definitly upset me.<br>  if your supposed to be marrying this guy,<br>  and he cant even talk to you about stuff thats going on in his life?<br>  shouldnt you be one of the FIRST people he goes to talk to?<br>  i mean, if your going to spend the rest of your life with someone, shouldnt they be a part of whats going on in your life, and be there to help/support you through it?<br>  <br>  a week without a text/call/email...kinda weird to me.
s4T9TxbHaa	well... i personally call my girlfriend "pork-chop" sometimes<br>  <br>  and i can tell you that she hates it, but she's adorable when she's frustrated...<br>  <br>  it has nothing to do with her name; but is somewhat of an inside joke between the two of us. I'm a butcher, and i once was having a rant about the dozen-or-so varieties of pork-chops i deal with, and the confusion that arises with the different names/prices paired with truly nominal actual differences in the way I'd slice em off the tenderloin. and then she jokingly told me to stop complaining about pork-chops; henceforth the name was born<br>  <br>  the moral of that long and not very entertaining story is simply this; make it something that MEANS something to the both of you. don't try just rhyme words. find something that only the two of you can share a memory and a smile over.|`|c88af8ec29fbd81237760a26aa135ee7aa	My friends little girls name is Natalie, we call her Talie (taally) I think its really cute|`|Z5zGnM1xaa	Natibug|`|N7dfCOOLaa	Nat<br>  Nattie<br>  Lee-Lee<br>  <br>  <br>  Just a couple...|`|hKclJxUQaa	easy...."natty"....that wasn't so bad|`|ccfb71afaac5d79b06639126ff012c31aa	well its YOUR girlfriend,<br>  so whats the first thing that pops into your head when you think of her?|`|96961ed55faeca95fb4274848975d577aa	natnat

I don't understand. Are you worried that he would feel betrayed because you wanted to enjoy yourself? If so, he's... Really not worth being with. Honestly? It's YOUR body, and masturbation is a NATURAL process. If you're worried that your husband wouldn't want you to orgasm just because he wouldn't be there... You two have some serious marital issues... <br>  <br>  He should be HAPPY that you can feel great without him there all the time... After all, the majority of women have a difficult time getting off during sex, particularly if the stimulation is only vaginal- shouldn't you two be able to come to the consensus that it's only fair that SOMEONE gets you off? <br>  <br>  I GUARANTEE you, he masturbates frequently. As a part of nature, you have every right.|`|AA10182431	There is nothing wrong with that.  I'm sure he does it as well.

If you like it and feel better than with a man then you are.|`|p5JoLCG8aa	I'd definitely say you were attracted to women since watching lesbian porn pleases you. I tried being with a woman once since men were annoying me, but it wasn't for me.

I'm bisexual. The only reason I call myself that is because, through experience, I've realized that I'm attracted to all kinds of people.<br>  <br>  Don't go looking for a girl to ''try things out with''.  Just because you're interested in women doesn't mean youre interested in ALL women.  You could end up having an uncomfortable experience with a girl you aren't attracted to, and that's never fun. It also doesn't prove anything- you could still be attracted to other women.<br>  <br>  All you can do is let yourself like who you like, and when that happens, be honest with yourself.  Whether it's a man or a woman, its more about the person than their gender.

It all depends on the person, what you feel most comfortable having 'down there' is all that matters.|`|fSZm2rOEaa	It depends what the girls are comfortable with... or what their boyfriend's/husbands/or I guess Girlfriends prefer.

I work for a  doctor and it means that you need to have more for play before you start having sex. If a women does not have a blood rush form excitement then her vagina will be looser than normal.  When a guy gets hard than his blood is pumping but with a girl it takes a little more work.<br>  Seriously try more for play before sex and I know that will work. Women are completely different than men. <br>  This does not mean at all that she is not in to you it;s just how a womens body works...|`|MPIE0PpMaa	im a nurse.. im going to be honest..<br>  the only possible way her vagina could be looser is something was in there to make it looser via sleeping around or using toys.<br>  when you don't have sex for a few days, the vagina tightens up.<br>  although females vagina's do get a little looser when you first start having sex, it wouldn't be as noticeable as you explained.<br>  she is lying to you about something, either she is cheating or using big toys..<br>  i hope i was helpful!|`|LL2R8n8Xaa	It's probably just from the two of you having sex so often.

Still, the silent treatment isn't the way that anyone should display their frustrations and angers. After all - what does it solve? In the end it probably makes the situation worse; since you've discussed it in the past and he is clearly IGNORING that too. I am all for leaving the scene of an agruement for a couple of hours to blow off some steam and then coming back for a discussion. My advice to you would try to talk to him more about this, perhaps he should see an counsler to learn how to deal with his frustrations better - maybe you should see one together to work on your relationship as you live together. Worse case - you aren't meant to be together.<br>  <br>  P.S. I like the idea for trying the silent treatment on him right back as suggested above. It's worth a shot to see what comes of it.|`|YNPnAwFNaa	Patience is key.<br>  Talk to him though, guys are stubborn.

Give him space to think and breath. Act like hes not there - read a book - type a email - and laugh out loud - talk on the phone to a friend and sound like you are having fun - then make a date - get dressed up and go out with your friends - stay out late. When he calls don't answer turn your phone off.   |`|QStp9irGaa	He likes for you to chase him. Give him the silent treatment back and wait until he breaks.

That's the basic problem.  Trying to figure out how to romance him is like trying to figure out how to change his tires:  he doesn't have the equipment necessary.  If it's important to you, and he's just not understanding it, you need to point-blank tell him (not hinting, not cute, not imply), just flat-out tell him, "Hey, I need some romance here!  I know it's not your thing, but it IS my thing, and I'm supposed to have my needs met."<br>  <br>  Now, if you're just trying to romance him not because you want it, but because you think you're supposed to, or that deep-down he really needs it, just stop.

eKkqk3psaa	honestly, it really depends on the type. It's not easy and there's usually hurt feelings somewhere. But bottom line to remain strong and follow thru is to remember this: If they are true friends they'll respect your decision to part and go onto a separate path. And if it's a "bad" group where you want to try and bring a friend out of it too, you need to remember your rules of someone drowning. Which is, unless your firmly settled in a safe place (meaning already moved on and unattached from that type) DO NOT try to rescue anyone but yourself. Because what can happen is you'll both be dragged down by each others weaknesses. I wish you luck and I like to see this type of question because too many ppl "say" they want out but don't actually do it. Remember: You are a strong person, and nothing they say or do should effect your decision to move on cause it's YOUR life, not theirs. Good Luck!|`|hT0N20QRaa	The first step is to stop caring what they think of you.

INmOgM4Maa	Well maybe you should flirt with him back. Sounds like he flirts and then you don't really show you're interested so he kind of backs off for a little while and then flirts with you again and it just keeps going that way. Try showing him that you're interested that way he feels more comfortable flirting with you back more and more. Days he acts like you don't exist go over to him and try flirting with him. Anyways thats just one thought. My other thought is he's just doing it because you're the new girl. I've been in both the situations I just said so I'm not sure what one he could be doing. Anyways just try talking and flirting with him more and see where it goes. Sounds like your best bet. Good luck! ;) |`|vvrhUDbfaa	Good question! Usually guys who r confident flirt with pretty girls. It does not mean they like you, they just want to have fun. Just play along and don't get too excited cause he is probly flirting with some other girl in his other classes. Now maybe ask him if he wants to study with you sometime. That way if he says yes then you could maybe take him more seriously.|`|BEScv1bxaa	  Talk to him and see where that gos you might try flirting back what have you got to lose.If nothing else you could make a Friend and that cloud lead to other people.|`|qdnb5ueoaa	Sorry.I actually don't know when a guy is flirting..but maybe he will pick on you or something like that and talk to you.i think he likes you|`|vTZMxmxGaa	omgosh this has happened to me before too<br>  <br>  hes just nervous because hes worrided u dont lyke him bakk<br>  so  flirt back and it will get better<br>  it did for meh[;<br>  <br>  <br>  good luckk|`|VuQND9WKaa	I would think he is though, Because it seems like he pays off alot of attention to you.|`|gvRkldRKaa	he likes you He is probably scared to say something |`|LoM7eeDSaa	How about you ask him instead of wondering.<br>  The worse he can say is no, and that means move on. <br>  good luck !|`|CRXDSOQNaa	well he just likes you as an amigo<br>  |`|1XcTZRemaa	I think that there's a high possibility this guy likes you, and that he is flirting with you. And on those days where he acts like you don't exist, he may feel like he shouldn't be too outgoing, in case you don't like him back. I would say that you should just ask him if he likes you, or a friend of his, and if not, that's the worse that can happen. :) Good luck!|`|AA11284366	boys can be tricky.<br>  <br>  hes being a little immature, which could mean he likes you. at the same time, it could mean he's just messing around. i suggest yu get to know him a little better. because i really dont know what to say. it seems like one of those things guys do or either when they're bored, or trying not to make things obviously.|`|EZLtESP1aa	He is probably flirting with you because your new. It is hard to tell sometimes because some guys seem like they are flirting when they are just being really friendly...I have a friend who is like that and girls get confused all the time. Instead of wondering, you could flirt a little and maybe ask him if he wants to do something sometime. Then you'll get your answer. A lot of girls get there hopes up too fast, but when can we do? Just try not to look too much into it..Maybe even back off and see what he does. You may get your answer. Good luck.|`|L4gaB4xiaa	thats just the way guys are.  believe me he is into you.|`|KPG5CHU9aa	oh well maybe he's just trying to be nice since your new(:<br>  or there's something goin on lol|`|r5cImL6Caa	sounds like you go to my school all the guys do that there..<br>  hmmm i wonder lol
8zIPVtQvaa	It is totally possible to get out of the friend zone. I had a friend that did and him and his girl have been together for more than a year. I don't know how close of friends you are but you both should be really close. Get to where she can trust you and enjoys being with you. Even if it is as a friend. They be completely honest with her. Tell her that what your about to tell her might be a shock but if things don't work out you both have to promise to still be close. That way, worse case scenario, you will still be friends and close. Than just tell her how you feel and that you love being her friend more than anything but you can't keep this from her any longer. If she feels the same way than that's great. Especially b/c of how close you both are. It makes it easier. If not just assure her that this won't screw up your relationship. GOOD LUCK!!|`|6VuWeNZDaa	you need to break the touch barrier. When you open a door for her (if you don't already, start) guide her through with your hand on her lower back.

The thing is, if she reciprocates your feelings, it should be pretty noticeable by the way she acts around you. However, I know how bad guys are at catching our subtle "signs", so I won't hold it against you :) Since you two are friends, you can casually throw out a "so when's our date?" in a partially-joking style. This way if her response is negative, it won't kill the friendship since she won't take it completely seriously anyways. However, if she digs you, you'll know. Oh trust me you'll know :)<br>  Edit: I wouldn't go all crazy and sit her down for a "love confession"... it may scare her off. From personal experience, whenever a guy did that to me, our friendship started slowly drifting apart until finally we lost contact.|`|cWenZqsfaa	You're gonna just have to go for something. Weither its talking about being more than friends [feelings, and all that goodness] or ask her to stay after a long night of hanging out.

I have a good story and a bad story for you. First my best friend (male) of a looong time (who I knew had a HUGE crush on me) never got outta the friend zone because I just didn't feel that way about him. But we are still friends to this day. Second I had a guy friend for about 2 years and eventually ended up seeing something in him I hadn't seen for a long time, and we ended up dating for 3 years. The point is that it could go either way. Does she know you like her? My best advice would be to keep being her good friend and don't make things weird by saying HEY I LIKE YOU!!! Cuz then you might loose her friendship too. If all else fails, if you really care for her then if she just looks at you like a friend, you will stay friends with her and just be happy for her if she does find a man. Keep being your charming self and if she's into you too she will eventually come around. It just might take some time. Flirt with her, but dont come off desperately in love, ya know what I mean? Keep it cool, girls like that, they don't want a guy who is throwing themself at her. Good luck!!!!|`|gAhabaP7aa	First off, you need to start flirting if you like her. DO you really care for her. Do anything for her. Trust her. Does she trust you. If yes, then you need to make a move. One weekend, take her to the movies. A funny one the first time. Let her pick the second one. at both, make sure you brush her hand occasionally. Let her have the popcorn. Then, if it all works, take her to dinner somewhere nice. She will pick up the hint, as whats on your mind, and then flat out tell her how you feel about her. Then, end it with will you go out with me. That's how my bf got me. Have fun and good luck. |`|dKxrbUQZaa	I'd say Just give her suttle hints your into her like that and get more and more obvious. Like smile at her, look her in the eyes, be helpful, compliment her.|`|ClRuPRs7aa	I've been really close friends with this guy, and we ended up dating. He came out the friend zone by talking to me almost all night and eventually admitted that he was falling in love with me. He also gave a few hints along the way. Like he would look into my eyes, flirt a little bit, and tell me how great I am, sit really close to me etc etc. Hope that helps, and hope she likes you too! good luck|`|wEg1PNT1aa	This is really tough. Being in the friend zone is hard to get out of. When a guy is in my "friend zone" I like to keep him there so I don't risk ruining friendships or making things awkward. Try moving a little closer to her and being spontainiously romantic with her. |`|Sucivxykaa	I'm sorry but once your in the friends zone, your in the friends zone.  But if you want to go for it I would suggest talking to her about it.  In this case subtle hints won't work.  Be straight forward.|`|W30MOowuaa	Talk to her and let her know how you feel about her and see where it goes.|`|1Ys7uSHHaa	girls are bitches.

LdlNMvsbaa	I really think you should tell your boyfriend how you feel. If his actions are making you uncomfertable, you should let him know that. Then, if he truely cares about you (which he sounds like he does) he will stop. However, if he denys any flirting, you should also accept what he is saying. Maybe he doesn't mean to be flirty with other girls, and may not be trying to at all. You should be okay since he isn't really trying to pick them up (by telling them he's taken.)<br>  <br>  For more advice, please check out my brand new website designed for advice and reweiws: freewebs.com/advicebuzz|`|eCxrIWK8aa	If He Wants to flirt with other girls he is a Jerk.Im 16 too and me and my boyfriend have been dating for 2 years and three months.He does not worth your time if he WANTS to flirt with other girls.Im sure he cares about you but..why would he want to flirt with other girls if your all he thinks about. that's obviously a lie because he flirts with other girls.

But, make sure you do not point fingers.  Say "I feel....." not "Why do you....."|`|4S6V4sb4aa	Why don't you flirt with guys??  Because you care for him and know it would be wrong to do so...

How would he feel if you said you loved him but you flirt with other guys, better yet, ask yourself, could you do that to him, If you feel like you could never do that to him, because you care for him, then I think you've found the answer to your question. He's not treating you or your relationship with any respect or of much value to him, even though he says the opposite with his mouth....Actions speak louder than words, don't let him fool you, don't wait to find out he was just playing you all along.  If you don't tell him it's bothering you, it's just gonna keep happening and you will continue to be hurt and frustrated.<br>  <br>  also, at this age, many teenagers really feel that they're in love, but they're not, they're really just infatuated with that person, but this is no excuse for him to treat you and your relationship this way. Don't put up with it, be strong and know you deserve better.|`|KfeeV5nraa	i think he is just a guy that is what they do<br>  HELP ME?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AshPa6wwoXPHnk2edzVHrZTsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222184009AANIVCe">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090223142427AA62Duo&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aot3.dttfAQxI3rAGHryoG7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222202542AAkT84a">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  THANKS HELP GREATLY APPRECIATED|`|e2tE6EI8aa	I cant stand flirty guys...Why are they flirting??

If you don't like this, TELL HIM.|`|lWd6fkgFaa	If your boyfriend loves you he will do anything not to upset you. The fact that you are writing this today proves you have been hurt by his actions. You need to explain to him that he is upsetting you by his behaviour and if he loves you he needs to stop otherwise the relationship cannot continue. It,s better to break up with him now rather than a lifetime of misery|`|OntO6wE4aa	He might love you but he doesn't show you much respect. While he's with you he makes other girls think he's available. Doesn't make it alright if he tells them the truth. If it bothers you it isn't alright. At your age it's hard to set rules and keep your mate, especially when your bf is popular. If he loves you he'll make changes that keep you both happy. good luck|`|3y2E0Urzaa	maybe you don't compliment him enough on what he would like to complimented on, so he appreciates it when other people do.<br>  <br>  Also, my gf and I talk about certain things, and my best guy friends and I talk about totally different stuff.

I think you think you 'love' him...but you don't- its a crush...<br>  <br>  SECOND...he's a guy...guy's (especially teenager guys) are horney...they can't help it, it's the way their brain works...as for self control...they get that sometime in life if your lucky.<br>  <br>  He is keeping an open mind...considering he is young- not to make you feel bad but just to inform you, a boy at 16 isn't looking for anything 'marriage' wise (in most cases.) He is looking to have a good time and be stress free. Thats just how they work...where as woman want a steady boyfriend who they don't have to worry about it.<br>  <br>  My advice- Don't be that sereious...your 16- you have plenty of time to have fun!! and later you will have a different kind of fun with the one you love for the rest of your life... but for right now be 16!! You will be stressed a lot less I promise. :) And once he feels like you are less worried with him...the more he will come around to you..in some cases :)|`|M8fQiTsqaa	yeh hun, even if he does flirt, at the end of the day, he tells them hes taken right?<br>  <br>  so he like introduces you to them girls<br>  <br>  dont worry, hes all yours<br>  <br>  if you feel uncomfortable with it, then try talkin to him about it xx|`|5s6iZ7OVaa	Well is he actually flirting?

She died of birth defects so it wasn't sudden like a car accident but it was still really hard on us all and I still get choked up talking about her but it helps me feel better.  Talk to your school counselor, doctor, teacher, or a pastor and get it out.  Many churches will have someone on call that you can talk to.  As far as the dream goes, it could mean anything.  If you were scared of something that happened that day it could turn up in a dream like that, it doesn't necessarily mean that you saw into the future.  It is good that things remind you of him because that is how our loved ones stay in our heart.  I purposely gave my daughter my sisters middle name so that I would always remember her.

Probably nothing at all.  This was just a coincident.  It was not your fault and there would have been nothing for you to do to prevent it.  As far as the crying goes, there is nothing wrong with that.  Mourning in normal...not crazy.

Just start up conversations. Just start talking about things that ya'll have in common. I hate when friendships start to fade. Hope everything works out for ya.

Because Johnny will probably be doing your gardening, if you play your cards right.|`|248d629dc7993eeabe3d26fc689168caaa	um, ask them?
005861e3c95c311eeb245fa82e980143aa	Ofcourse you should be worried. I don't know your friend, but she sounds like a backstabber. First you need to find out how your boyfriend feels about her, cuz if she doesn't like her and sees her as just as a friend well then talk to her and tell her to back off. If he feels something then let them go, you don't need either.|`|00989779e269892288ca7696c3853395aa	uhh...YEA. I think she told you she likes him because he's cheating on you with him.

22d72f9b7e293330d841064cc603e551aa	You buy gifts for people because it comes from your heart, not because it's whats expected of you or you think they're getting you something. Growing up, friends loose touch but it doesn't always make them less a friend. If you think of her as your friend, buy from your heart.|`|895c61d53a7ffc4de8304a5ff26a1b3aaa	Sure. They say "it is better to give than to receive".|`|AA10792539	Why not invite her out for an outting on the weekend instead? Take it from there. If she is a true friend ,,she will find the time within 2weeks.|`|AA11104489	I've been through this myself.  <br>  <br>  If you're still interested in being her friend, I'd suggest getting something inexpensive and little, like a pretty bracelet or something for her hair, or lotion/perfume and include a card with a message like:<br>  <br>  "Just thinking of you around Christmas and wanted to let you know that I miss talking with you and hope we can spend more time together in 2007."<br>  <br>  That's not needy, doesn't require a response unless she wants to, and also covers you in case she has gotten you a gift.  If she hasn't, you look generous!<br>  <br>  If you do NOT want to be friends with her anymore, I wouldn't worry about getting her a gift, but perhaps having a card on hand in case she does have something for you; regardless of how close you are now, she was an important friend to you and you shouldn't be rude to her.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps you make your decision!  Good Luck!|`|b6ffa8f90d44e4c7b93efefb06ed8042aa	Just get the gift and see how things turn out.

Which is normal.<br>  I would buy her a gift. . .absolutely. She obviously meant something to you and had an impact on your life. It's a win/win if you buy her a gift. She'll at least know you appreciate her. . .or what you had as friends.<br>  When in doubt. . .go for kindness.|`|345a3e961e0295e9f7fc29492eccac78aa	well like i don't know like what you should like do.|`|62e57f60dbfa158e03395733393c6338aa	The same thing happened to me when I got into high school.

I've lost a couple of very good friends over school transitions, don't repeat my mistake!<br>  <br>  Listen, childhood friendship is deep, it's basically next to family.  You've got a lot of memories there, but you are both trying to expand and grow as people at the same time. You are expanding your social circle and so is she. <br>  <br>  My advice is to call her up to hang out with you. Yes, get her a present too. Tell her that you're a little worried about you guys growing apart; most likely she will echo your feelings. If she doesn't, then maybe the friendship is going to fizzle into nothing, you have to accept that too.

52bb3f93665c2635dc84d110eed50e2caa	There is no set time as to how long it takes for a woman to reach orgasm,some women never do!Women are all different and they do not all reach orgasm in the same way.The best way to get there is to experiment with different positions and technics.Self exploration is one way of finding out what is most likely to do it for you,the most important thing is to relax and not concentrate on having an orgasm just enjoy reaching a climax, plenty of foreplay will sometimes help anal stimulation can also help in some cases.At the end of the day experimentation is the key.|`|1d5d8bccd65f8dda49977dd81c81f96faa	Have ur partner enter u from behind,  (I dont mean anal sex) that way he can manually stimulate the clitoris while having intercourse.

And then just find some cool things out about them? Making a list of things to talk about might help.Or if your an out-going person, then just go by the flow. I'm complete American , so it doesn't creeep me out when people start conversations with me. So you might come to find that people like making new friends right back.People will respect you for you, especially if your outgoing!! I hope that helped.

It won't work! If you have been with him for 3 years and he is still like this then he always will be. Here are your options 1- you decide to stick around and be his full time housekeeper or 2- you decide you deserve someone much better and get out of this! I know its hard to leave someone after 3 years (I have had experience) but I have also had experience in knowing people do not change! If I were you I would get out of this before you waste anymore of your time. I mean can you really see yourself cleaning after him for the rest of your life? and bad hygiene omg get out! Good luck!
2b80f8f585cf77ea462d3c7714e78d55aa	thats the worst, the guy you like is going to think you are the one making his friend say all the stuff and annoying him- never go through the best friend they always reck it- speak to the guy directly without his mate and explain the situation, you never know, you might begin a freindship and more with this guy.

I highly recommend reading The Five Love Languages it changed my outlook on how to love my wife!!!|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	What you are doing is good another thing very important when you see a pretty girl coming your way don't look her way because your girlfriend has already spotted her a mile away and I'm not kidding.We women have x-ray vision when it comes to our husbands or boyfriends and the opposite sex. And if she ask who do you think is prettier well you no what to say with that one. You just keep reassuring her that you will never hurt her she will get the message. I was like her and my husband was good about reassuring me when I needed it and I did come to trust him. It took about 17 years but it did happen and I know I had me a good man who promise he would never hurt me. One year later he moved out to be with a co-worker he had been seeing for over 3 years he did move back home but I am more f u c k e d  up then before so place if you don't have staying power then don't mess her up anymore then she already is. Even though I love my husband I hate him and will never till the day I die forgive him for what he said and did to me.He knows how I feel about him and the fact that I will never forgive him and he said he understands and is willing to take his punishment like a man because he caused it himself.Now that's love in my book.|`|qKNrmCAvaa	Well, the only thing you can do is try and decide if you want to be in this thing for the long haul because it may take her a really long time to cave in.  <br>  All you can do is show her you care and keep being her friend.  <br>  You should really respect the fact that she has her guard up and is being sensible by not rushing back into another relationship and give her time and space to heal.

DwpjPsnHaa	It seems like you have already gotten on the right track with calling  a lawyer and everything, but if you really feel threatened by this woman, you said shes started talking to your children and that her boyfriend comes around every once and a while, then you should consider going to the police and simply asking them if there is a way to stop her without trying to press charges or whatever. However if you are don't have legal immigration and are too afraid to go near the police simply get someone to help you out and give her a piece of mind, maybe if you have a big tall boyfriend or something and just have him go over and tell her to stop lying and leave you alone!<br>  best of luck|`|6Bg2F600aa	This situation can turn into a nightmare for you if you aren't careful.  The best thing you can do is to call the police and give them all of the information you wrote here.  Start with the illegal alien info including the multiple Id's, stolen social security numbers, multiple jobs, etc and then move up to the unfounded accusations of fraud.  The police will most definitely move on the illegal alien information and hopefully investigate the false accusations as well and that should take care of your problem.<br>  <br>  If the ex-friend is still hanging around after the police get through with the bf, then you will probably want to change your phone number, and close your e-mail accounts and reopen them under a different name.  Something else you should think about is, has this 'friend" ever had access to any of your credit card info?  If so, and since they have a penchant for identify theft, you may want to think about changing or closing your accounts to avoid another big hassle.<br>  <br>  Regarding the credit card apps in the bf's name with you as a second signer, frequently those applications require the social security number of the second signer, which automatically makes you a party to the transaction and could leave you holding the bag on a lot of accumulated debt, so this is another good reason to go to the police and to include this information as well in your report.<br>  <br>  Finally, since you will have reported all of this to the police, and if she continues to give you a hassle, then you can always go to court for a restraining order against her.  You will have the police report to use as evidence if necessary.
AoB391EYaa	Well, Bean.<br>  It happens to many people. Your friends have not understood that you did not mean any evil in calling them bitches. Just appologise to them sincerely and stay cool.

Friends would not lie to get you in trouble on purpose.  A friend is someone who will always watch your back, be loyal to you no matter what, and do whatever they can to help when you need it.  They can have a lot of other good qualities and characteristics, but these qualities are essential.<br>  <br>  It's sometimes pretty difficult to choose your friends.  After all, you can't hand out applications.  But if you will pay close attention to what they say and how they treat others, that will be a pretty good indication of the kind of character that individuals have.  Over time, you will be able to figure out who is and who is not a friend.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|mznvyXpGaa	A real friend wouldn't make you feel this way, they also wouldn't make you question if they are your true friends or not.
6Bg2F600aa	It's not a bad thing to be afraid to move to a new location.  After all, it's like moving to another world but trust in your mom and dad.  I think that Pop, Lock & Drop It__xox has the right idea.  If you have very close family members you can stay with and you are very close to graduation, that could be an option provided you feel like you can put up with getting used to an entirely new family with new responsibilities.<br>  <br>  But chances are that you still have years to go before graduation and you will not have a decision about this in the first place.  So try to make the best of it.  I live in Texas and it's not like moving to the outback, or the unpopulated jungles of Borneo.  Texas is a pretty cool place to live, and like Pop, Lock said, you most likely will end up with a lot more friends and you will find that it's the best thing that ever happened to you.<br>  <br>  It's not like you have a lot of choices anyway, so you might as well try to make the best of it.  And I also think that Pop, Lock had a good idea when she suggested that you discuss it with your parents and let them know how you feel.  I know that sometimes it seems like they don't ever take into consideration how you feel, but I honestly believe that they are trying to do what's best for not only you but the whole family, and most likely this move is something that cannot be avoided.<br>  <br>  And as far as your friends are concerned, they may act like they are mad, but the truth is that they most likely are just afraid of losing you as a friend.  But MySpace or Yahoo 360 will provide them with lots of opportunities to keep in touch so that you can keep up your friendship with them and make a whole bunch of new friends as well.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to you and best wishes always|`|099b875af641ee7291824adf37803730aa	well depending on how old you are you could ask them if you could stay there with a friend or family to finish out your school years it's worth a shot good luck|`|EC0OLZEYaa	WELL I WAS THERE ONCE WHEN MY MOTHER WANTED TO MOVE ALL OVER THE PLACE.I HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO WITH HER.I STILL KEPT IN TOUCH WITH MY OTHER FRIENDS BY,CALLING THEM,WRITING THEM,AND EVEN VISITING THEM.BUT IF YOUR PARENTS DO DECIDE TO MOVE MAYBE YOU CAN DO WHAT I DID.BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU WILL FORGET YOUR FRIENDS.HAVE YOU TOLD YOUR PARENTS HOW YOU FELT.WELL GIVE THIS A TRY IT MIGHT WORK OH ONE MORE THING MAYBE THEY CAN COME TO VISIT YOU TO.|`|bfA1bvOXaa	First, it's not a bad thing that you are afraid of moving. That is completely normal! And second, talk to your parents. You're friends really need to understand this, too. It's not your fault that this is happening, so talk to them about it. If you move, you can still keep your friends. I live across the U.S from one of my best friends, who also lives in Cali, and we talk all the time! You'll be fine.|`|AA10289446	Your fears are normal.  I live in Texas and recently relocated from NYC.  It is very different. If your parents do decide to move to Texas, you will make new friends and attend a new school.  After a while, you will become more settled. It is good to reassure your friends that although you are moving you can still keep in contact with them and visit them.|`|wSCtDmCWaa	Its not your fault you have to move? and is there like any realitive you can stay with? thats what i wanted to do when we moved. and we moved and i ended up having more fun then i did where i used to live.<br>  <br>  i have toms more friends. and had a new attitude. it was hard at first yea i'll admit but the moment i had friends i had so much fun! <br>  <br>  and that gives you all the more reason to travel and have fun. go to cali on weekends or on breaks and spend it with your friends i have to say the trips back home were funner then just hangning out on weekends.<br>  <br>  and theres the phone, aol, myspace talk to them there sure your gonna miss them but it could be good for you<br>  <br>  and just tell your friends you cant fix it, its not your fault you have to move. ? why arnt they supportive? and being stressed out isnt a good idea.<br>  <br>  talk to your parents and tell them how your feeling and the problems find out if there are any other options for you<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck

Women aren't a big mystery, They have most of the same wants, desires and needs as many males. And most of all, Always treat a lady with the respect and tenderness that she deserves.

It is so relevant in this subject yet so few include it. So you are obviously above average intelligence for most askers here.  That is good.<br>  You have been in that school for 4 years so the dating pool has been picked over. That is probably your biggest obstacle.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you will be going to college soon and there will be a whole new crop to harvest my friend. Until then, aren't there any girls that smile a little more than the others or laugh a little easier at your jokes? These are the ones you want to go after. Once everyone graduates and goes to college they break up anyway. This will be a short term thing, so find one of these types and just ask her to a lunch date or something and go from there.|`|XNMu4vv2aa	Become friends with a girl you're interested in. Start hanging out with her in a group setting, and as your friendship progresses, transition into a one-on-one situation. Ask her to come to your hockey games, go out with the group for pizza and laser tag, whatever. Then, if it seems as if your friendship is going well, tell her how you feel about her. <br>  <br>  Now, you won't have a girlfriend overnight. It might take quite a while, and if you're really interested in this girl, you won't try to rush it. And if she rejects you, then it's okay.

a6XaTJBsaa	Lol, I'm "almost" like the female version of that. I don't do any of that stuff either and it never interests me. I'm glad that you feel that way too, cause I would never do any of those stuff just to get a boyfriend. And you're wondering, well I'm 18 and I have never find that kind of boy a turn on, in fact I find guys like you (nice guys) a turn on (no I'm not hitting on you), I'm just saying that I prefer a nice guy over a bad one any any any day, anyone can pay me a million dollars, and I'd still refuse and still be with the nice guy. And no I'm not a girl that used to be "bad" and I learned my lesson, I was always this way and I will always be. But doesn't mean I can't be all sexy to my future bf =P. So there goes your answer.|`|CFpoiPWvaa	At that age most girls want to date people that are popular and cool. For some weird mysterious reason they don't want the guys that will treat them right and will be faithful. They want the guys that are dicks and will probably cheat on them. Dont ask why, nobody not even then girls know. Although you need to realize that you really don't ever want to get involved with girls like that. Find someone that wants to actually be with you, not a person who just wants to tell there friends they had you.|`|8cd5f72d1b072964d9d14519dd841c44aa	I dont look for a guy a who drinks and all that..

DO NOT ask him out....or tell him you love him!!<br>  Thats Silly!!<br>  <br>  <br>  Ur going to boost his ego and have him thinking your a little on the pshyco side.

The guy might not mind, but girls would. I remember my friends and I dissing a girl who asked this guy out, when I was 13. Also if he turns you down, you'd just be embarrassed. <br>  <br>  Yes, it hurts, i know. You will experience it a lot more, so good luck.<br>  <br>  Best way, is to first ask around his friends to see who he is interested in.<br>  <br>  Most important thing to remember is that if he isn't interested, to try to get over it. It hurts. but remember you would deserve someone so much better.|`|ZSZU9XZlaa	uhh... 13...  well, i'm a guy, and i kno what you mean.  well, whether you're young or not (some call 13 young, i don't really care) i'll assume you'll understand this.  <br>  <br>  first of all, why do you love him?  <br>  <br>  answer this question out loud to yourself.  I<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  f you can't, then read on.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  this will sound kinda wierd, but if you can answer that question, then maybe you should not go for him.  why?  because of all the love relationships i know, people who truly love each other have a very very hard time explaining why they love each other, but that they just do.  of course, that doesn't apply to everyone.  <br>  <br>  in any case, you can do what you want.  it's your life, although you have to understand the consequences of any actions you do in all of your life.  <br>  <br>  "Life's a one-chance opportunity... take it or leave it!"  this saying goes both ways.  it supports what you do, and it goes against you.  you choose the kind of life you want.  <br>  --With the situation going on, telling him you love him can create drama between you and the other girl.  however, not telling him is just as equally painful.  <br>  <br>  hope this helps<br>  <br>  Personally though, I support BeeGirl's answer
FO5E75ZQaa	i think sum guys r too shy. but usually the ones that r kind of quiet r the ones that the girls usually like. the ones that talk to girls more r sumtimes not the real sweet ones. not all the time...but just sumtimes...|`|8raYZ2Qfaa	the guys that have no problem talking to girls are extremely confident about themselves and the people that they are around.  on the other hand, some guys have very low self-esteem and therefore think that girls do not want to talk to them and that is why they choose not to

Innanzitutto per un uomo è difficile dire alla ragazza i propri sentimenti inoltre la timidezza cancella quello che si voleva dire . poi ci sono quelli sopraffatti dal dubbio perchè si chiede:< Ma le piaccio veramente?> e poi ci sono quelli contrffatti dalla voglia di quella persona, cioè quando un uomo è innamorato pazzo di quella persona diventa fastidioso e fa anke delle stupidaggini per quella persona.

Se gli hai donato te stessa è ritornato non per amor tuo, ma per quello che gli hai "concesso". <br>  In amore i ripensamenti sono una cosa d'avvero rara e spesso non portano a niente.<br>  Se una persona è d'avvero interessata a donarti amore, trova tanti modi per fartelo capire, certamente non esordirà rinfacciandoti eventuali disappunti del passato. <br>  Purtroppo, l'ormai defunto corteggiamento è stato dimenticato dai giovani.

AcbY4okZaa	Ne hai parlato con lui direttamente, prima di arrivare a questi eccessi? Hai provato tutto quello che potevi? Non è solo una questione di dignità, per le prima c'è un fattore di rispetto ed amor reciproco e nel tuo caso sei proprio alla crisi del terzo anno,cioè o la passi o ti lasci, sembrerà incredibile, ma è così. Da parte sua è un indice di freddezza averti detto a priori che vuole vederti solo 3 gg. alla settimana, ma soprattutto di superficialità e per tutta risposta tu non puoi obbligarlo a vederti tutti i giorni, io dico, vivendovi giorno per giorno capita quel che capita senza decidere a tavolino. Sembra che in tre anni abbiate perso la naturalezza del rapporto, la complicità, la curiosità. Attenta alla abitudinarietà è quella una causa che rovina le relazioni a lungo termine. Sorprendilo!!! E se devi lasciarlo non farlo nella speranza che lui ritorni. Non crearti aspettative illusorie e sii decisa nelle tue azioni, è una questione di rispetto e di amore verso te stessa.|`|517zNV0Oaa	Giusto, purtroppo ti sei accorta in neto ritardo che il tuo lui è un benemerito egoista, e probabilmente non mette la propria fidanzata sopra ogni cosa. Hai tempi mettevo la mia anche sopra i miei genitori, naturalmente quando giudicavo che sbagliavano, se avevano ragione, lasciavo correre, senza dare ragione o torto a entrambi, a volte bisogna lasciar correre, ma l'esperienza insegna.<br>  Noto anche, dalla tua domanda, che hai fatto dei tentativi.... quindi questo significa che anche la comunicazione sta cadendo.<br>  Se lo molli sicuramente ci soffrirai un pò, ma non ti stai perdendo niente, come tutte le donne, meriti di più.<br>  Ciao|`|zJlXc91aaa	Gettare alle ortiche una relazione durata tre anni è doloroso, prima di farlo cerca di chiarirti per l'ultima volta con lui, proprio esponendogli quello che hai detto a noi.

CHI C'E' C'E'!!>><br>  Lo ha fatto tutti i giorni, il tipo non è uscito quasi più, dimenticando anche le partite:<br>  Sembra una battuta stupida, ma non lo è, colpendolo nell'orgoglio maschile, SOLO IO, se ti vuole veramente,.....................<br>  ma se la storia è stanca.....................<br>  Ora una decisione molto dura la devi prendere, perchè certamente questo non è un rapporto, è solo un trascinare delle agonie che nessuno ha il coraggio di parlarne a cuore aperto!!<br>  Se la storia non la riesci a recuperare, ......................<br>  eh............... non sa cosa a perde!!!!!|`|0v92iHApaa	ho avuto una situazione del genere,e capisco come si soffre,anche se può sembrare una banalità...ma invece è una cosa seria...è giusto quello che hai detto,non può decidere solo lui quando vedervi,siete in due e se ti amasse veramente capirebbe che questa situazione ti fa stare male.io il mio raga quando si è comportato così l'ho lasciato,dopo un  varie settimane ha capito che ha sbagliato e soprattutto ha capito che l'amore per me era più grande di quello dei suoi amici....ha avuto paura di perdermi e così ha messo me al primo posto. ti consiglierei di lasciarlo,vedi come si comporta,se ti ama davvero ritornerà !!! kiss|`|EfoQqJ8Xaa	io non potrei accettare una cosa simile. pero magari prima di lasciarlo digli queste cose,fagli capire che cosi non va bene. non è un vero rapporto. e poi gli amici non li potete condividere insieme? se vedi che non capisce,meglio sola che male accompagnata. poi se capira' e tornera' ammettendo i suoi sbagli,deciderai tu se sarai disposta o no a perdonarlo.|`|FAPjgbAjaa	ammazza, dopo tre anni e mezzo ti tratta kosì?...<br>  secondo me dovresti lasciarlo e poi appunto kome hai detto, se ti ama veramente tornerà da te!!...perchè sembra kome se si sia stufato di stare kon te...sò ke è difficile credimi ti capisco ma a questo punto...penso sia la kosa piu giusta da fare!...<br>  <br>  in bocca al lupo!! baci|`|GNXeUUEuaa	FINALMENTE...una vera donna....infatti non devi accontentarti e fai benissimo..magari si dà una mossa o semplicemente troverai di meglio.anche se fosse durato 10 anni ti avrei risposto la stessa identica cosa.eppure ci sono donne che si accontentano, adesso siete fidanzati, un domani avrai bisogno di lui e ti risponderà che deve vedere i suoi amici!!non ha finto, se l'è tentata a comportarsi come un bambino e ci è riuscito.in fondo tutti gli uomini sono come i bimbi piccoli...se la tentano sempre..sono felice perchè vedo che esistono ancora donne con carattere e vera dignità...soffrirai il distacco ma mica tanto visto che un rapporto stile"quando mi servi ti faccio un fischio"se ti stressa regalagli un cane...ma continua così...la serenità di sentirti amata e al primo posto devi pretenderla!!!BRAVISSIMA..|`|H8ecXX7Maa	posso farti una domanda?? ma lasciarlo prima?? cioè quando è sceso a compromessi!! cmq nn vale sprecare la vita per una persona che nn ci tiene a te inanzi tutto ti fai male da sola ma sopratutto un giorno rimpiangerai quegli anni quei mesi quei giorni passati a rincorrere lui quando ti potevi trovare benissimo una persona che ti vuol bene sul serio|`|m0ah2kx9aa	secondo me non è amore,ma semplice opportunismo...la propria dignità viene prima di tutto perchè non dobbiamo essere gli zerbini di nessuno!!|`|pqOysF7Zaa	Io parlo dalla parte opposta alla tua... io sono il ragazzo che ha iniziato a trascurare la persona che voleva starmi accanto... Ie mie motivazioni (o giustificazioni) erano che volevo scappare, stavamo sempre insieme e ad un certo punto mi sono accorto (o almeno lo credo) che il mio non era amore... l'ho lasciata dopo molti mesi di reciproca agonia (eravamo insieme da quasi 7 anni)... ancora oggi non sò dirti se ho fatto bene o se mi pentirò della decisione presa ma mi rendo conto che cmq le cose nn potevano andare avanti in quel modo (il rapporto che si era creato nn era quello che volevamo)... la cosa "buffa" è che lei preferiva stare male con me che "bene" da sola e questo mi sta facendo pensare molto... ma proprio xche sò che tiene così tanto a me che non posso prenderla in giro o aspettare di farla soffrire nel peggiore dei modi (un tradimento)... Quindi penso che l'onesta sia la cosa più importante (con se stessi e con la persona a qui si tiene)... Ciao.

FcFrFbKCaa	io penso che la cosa si equivale.la vera differenza è che la donna tradisce perchè si innamora in quanto si sente trascurata dal marito,mentre l'uomo tradisce per cercarsi delle avventure sessuali per evadere dalla routine|`|3CgUGDrSaa	concordo con vecchio ultras immortale!!|`|6CHuxrN5aa	Non esiste una statistica dipende dalle persone, il tradimento non accade se tu non vuoi che accada io credo che le persone che tradiscono sono essere molto deboli, che fanno le cose senza pensarci buttandosi di colpo quello non e innamoramento dammi retta e solo un avventura ma tutto questo non dovrebbe accadere se si pensa che il matrimonio e sacro, quindi non credo che ci sia una statistica tra marito o moglie ce solo voglia di andare avanti rispettandosi e amandosi e insegnare ai figli i buoni esempi, ma purtroppo ormai sta cambiando tutto se ti guardi intorno ci sono piu' tradimenti che amori veri che delusione non trovi?|`|6mQwILdxaa	Io direi che sono al 50%...;]|`|CQBBI6u5aa	xme la monogamia non esiste.ma è1mia opinione.<br>  gli esseri umani si impongono di essere monogami, ma prima o poi nella vita capita a tutti di guardare qualcuno altro e desiderarlo anke se poi nn ci si va a letto.<br>  xme è cmq 1tradimento, xke hai desiderato un altro/a ke nn era il tuo o la tua fidanzata/o.<br>  a me è successo e mi succederà e a tutti i miei amici succede!<br>  quindi nn penso ci sia +una parte colpevole nel tradimento.<br>  può capitare a tutti quando meno te lo aspetti.|`|I5PbOFhaaa	da parte del marito|`|JaTgijLZaa	Gli uomini tradiscono di più....|`|JnLJu69Taa	....lo sai benissimo.....|`|K31dFm7Naa	dal marito!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  ovviamente è una questione di carattere ma nel 99.9% dei casi..

Ma a volte il tradimento è qualcosa di più complesso delle semplici avventure perché ci siamo innamorate/i.

nT7prUkjaa	ho 22 anni e sono stata fidanzata 4. ora ho una nuova storia da 7 mesi...<br>  ma passiamo a te.<br>  lui è un ragazzo con le sue problematiche e questo ci sta.<br>  ma il problema è che non si vive una storia 1 settimana al mese! siete quasi 2 persone che si vivono raccontandosi: al di là della mia poca propensione per le storie a distanza, non avete la quotidianità di base ed è quella che credo ti manchi.<br>  non fate nulla: CHE CONDIVIDETE??? su cosa si basa il vostro stare insieme???<br>  ormai ti sei abituata: lo dici come se fossi una malata terminale... sei giovane, hai 2 vite davanti, 1000 progetti e 10000 modi per realizzarli! l'amore è gioia, è condivisione, è soffrire insieme, è starsi accanto... non è come sopportare una flebo!<br>  stai male e ci credo: non avete una vita di coppia (se non quella sessuale, qualora ci fosse e non ne entro in merito)<br>  il vostro rapporto è sempre stato difficile: mi pare che tu non abbia bei ricordi e se ne hai non mi pare che servano neppure a confortarti! non li hai neppure menzionati.<br>  ti senti soffocare perché non ti sta bene più il vostro rapporto: sei cambiata ed è normale che pretenda un cambiamento anche dal vostro stare insieme.<br>  un ragazzo che non sa vedersela da solo non lo vedo neppure tanto maturo... si nasconde dietro persone, che sa che ti conoscono davvero. e lui? ti conosce ti comprende in questo momento in cui non stai bene né con te né con lui?<br>  devi pensare al futuro: e se nel tuo futuro non ci fosse lui? e se ci fosse un altro? e se non ci fosse nessuno?<br>  sei sicuramente una ragazza piena di potenzialità: non renderti dipendente già da ora! costruisci prima te stessa: se ti formi in base ad un altro sarai sempre schiava dell'altro.<br>  hai paura: è normale quando c'è un cambiamento!<br>  CORRI IL RISCHIO! se anche ti dovessi sbagliare non sarà la fine del mondo! il mondo è pieno di persone cattive e di persone meravigliose: entrambe le categorie ti fanno crescere!<br>  magari lo ami e lasciarlo è la cosa sbagliata: e se poi dovessi vivere tutta la vita col rimpianto di essere stata dietro una storia senza amici, senza uscite, senza vita!<br>  lascialo! <br>  se è vero amore in un modo o nell'altro vi ritroverete...|`|ExQpOq6Caa	I problemi ce li abbiamo tutti, chi più e chi meno: ma questo non significa che dobbiamo riversarli sul partner. Quindi metti le cose in chiaro, pensa a divertirti che 20 anni vengono una volta sola....|`|KsEx8ILjaa	nn saprei cosa consigliarti perchè sarà il tuo cuore a farlo, sembra banale ma credo che sia cosi... forse sei solo un pò annoiata e hai voglia di divertimetni, è normale hai 22 anni e magari certe cose in coppia nn si fanno... quando si esce fra amiche ci si diverte e nn si deve per forza combianre qualcosa di male, ma tra noi amiche donne si ha una complicità che con il proprio uomo è difficile raggiungere...|`|cSqc9prHaa	se stai male è un indizio che devi cambiare qualcosa nella tua vita lascialo anche momentaneamente xkè cosi vi fate male in due.. magari anche lui puo cambiare ma finkè andate avanti cosi nn risolvete granchè fidati c sn passata e a lungo andare è stata peggio che troncare prima... ricordati che se è amore vero non te lo tocca nessuno e tornerete insieme... non è una bugia è vero se ci pensi segui il tuo cuore cmq ma ricordati quale è il bene tuo e suo..|`|rnAKjGqIaa	ho solo un consiglio da darti<br>  dal momento che sei superconfusa nn fare nulla aspetta ke si skiarisca la nebbia ke è dentro di te solo allora capirai cosa fare....non importa quanto tempo c vorrà capirai cosa devi fare|`|dmUNjSDuaa	Ho passato 6 anni e mezzo con una ragazza.<br>  Dolcissima, una persona veramente come poche anche se ovviamente con i suoi difetti.<br>  Per lunghi periodi passavo momenti strani, con un senso d'ansia dentro, tante volte mi sono chiesto se era giusto andare avanti e altrettante ho cercato di riconquistarla con le unghie quando c'erano i momenti di crisi forte.<br>  Dopo quasi un anno di convivenza sono riemersi vecchi problemi e mi ha lasciato e dopo un periodo iniziale in cui sono stato malissimo ora mi sento sereno, un po solo ma vedo la vita davanti a me, non so come sarà ma mi sento bene e capisco che forse era meglio finirla prima.<br>  Ovviamente non voglio ne generalizzare ne farti pensare al peggio ma rifletti bene e se arrivi a quella conclusione fallo seppur naturalmente con dolore.<br>  Pensa, pensa e pensa ancora, io ovviamente tifo per te e mi auguro che la tua storia continui per il meglio.<br>  Per quanto riguarda le parole di tua sorella, beh... hai 22 anni e il tempo per qualcosa di serio gioca sicuramente a tuo favore.|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Stai male................. che confusione!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Comincia a prenderti un pò di pausa senza dire niente a nessuno, solo per te, ma non vedere neanche il nuovo ipotetico ragazzo.<br>  Poi comincia a vederti dentro, parla con il tuo cuore, vedi se la testa collima con lui, conflitto sicuramente.....................ma se non sei sicura di quello che vuoi, meglio la vecchia strada, sai quella nuova all'inizio sarà bella ma dopo i problemi che ti sei lasciata dietro ritorneranno!!!!!<br>  Allora saranno più guai che gioie!!!!!!
xbmxVmxzaa	Invadente........................gentilm...<br>  Tea, ma la tua privasy.........c'è?????<br>  Non essere gentile con quelli che ti hanno già offesa, perchè<br>  l'invadenza può generare benissimo l'offesa.<br>  Quindi non penso di fargli capire ma di andare direttamente al problema.|`|fHvSphSUaa	senza mezzi termini....ma con gentilezza....!! hehe...buona fortunaaaaa|`|fuoQ98Wraa	ma in che situazioni capita? <br>  dipende un po' dal contesto e da quello che succede trovare un pretesto per aprire il discorso.<br>  Comunque innanzitutto è fondamentale che siate d'accordo tu e lui, poi dipende.<br>  Puoi fare un esempio?<br>  <br>  EDIT: No quello che hai detto è un po' troppo, non si tratta di cercare un equilibrio sballato per il quieto vivere ma di crearne uno sano, dove  ognuno abbia lo spazio e il posto che gli compete.<br>  Non è tanto il fatto che esca spesso con voi, che ti capisco, a volte può essere fastidioso ma qui è il meno, è il fatto che lui sentendosi escluso influenza il vostro stare insieme.<br>  <br>  Intanto di' al tuo ragazzo che gli dia meno autorità, per esempio potresti dirgli: "io penso che ti divertiresti a fare shopping da solo, chissà poi con cosa torni... Magari scopriamo di te un lato nuovo :)" insomma qualcosa che gli faccia pensare "ho davvero bisogno del suo aiuto?" e poi che tu sei interessata ai suoi gusti, non a quelli del suo amico "sarà anche un posto stupendo quello che ti ha consigliato ma a te va? A me andava..." o meglio "perché non andiamo in quel posto di cui mi hai parlato?" o meglio "perché non mi fai conoscere qualche bel posticino a cui sei legato?"<br>  <br>  Insomma, mi sembra che il tuo ragazzo per primo dovrebbe accorgersi che se la cava alla grande senza l'amico.<br>  <br>  Poi all'amico: "grazie ma avevamo già deciso un'altra cosa", "grazie ma gli ho già preparato una sorpresa", "è una bell'idea, magari un'altra volta però, stasera volevamo fare altro" questo finché vuoi essere implicita,<br>  <br>  se vuoi essere un po' più esplicita "sei gentile a interessarti ma ci fa piacere sceglierlo insieme dopo" magari puoi aggiungere la prima volta "fa parte del divertimento", solo per non fargli una doccia fredda rispetto all'aria che ha tirato fino ad ora. O anche "sei gentile a volerlo accompagnare ma vorrei andare io" e magari aggiungi, sempre per il motivo di prima, "è un'occasione in più di stare insieme".<br>  <br>  E' importante però che queste cose tu le dica con fermezza, non con l'aria di chi chiede il permesso (ma quale?) di stare tu al tuo posto e lui al suo, il contenuto della frase è gentile ma tutto sta a come la dici: il messaggio che deve trasparire è "ti rispetto perché sei il migliore amico del mio ragazzo ma guarda che hai passato il limite". <br>  <br>  La frase deve essere sì cortese nel contenuto ma detta in modo asciutto, al limite quasi freddo, che si capisca che non ci sono repliche.|`|lk8NEtHaaa	prima ne parlerei con il mio ragazzo e insieme troveremo un modo gentile per fargli capire che deve staccarsi un pò da noi|`|9kDcu2LKaa	glielo si dice educatamente che qualche volta si intomette un pò troppo! diglielo in modo scherzoso ma facendogli capire che dici sul serio!! :-)|`|cu3V6yS5aa	gentilmente non mi riuscirebbe, facci parlare il tuo partner no?<br>  rispondete a qst domanda è importante...<a href="http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080130121323AAsQDRL&pa=FYd1D2bwHTHzJLthFu47QY2q7doFddDeU_sa3g_D_NuiXA--&paid=asked&msgr_status=">http://it.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|fW8dfucqaa	prova ad aspettare un po' di tempo.. magari cambia.. la mia amica faceva vedere al mio ragazzo la biancheria intima, gli regalava dei disegni fatti da lei, lo accompagnava dove doveva andare e una volta l'ha pure preso a braccetto.. tutto ciò davanti a me..adesso x fortuna ha smesso.. ma se riprende è meglio dire "guarda, senza offenderti, ma tu ti stai prendendo troppa confidenza tra me e *partner*..per favore finiscila di comportarti cosi perchè da fastidio ad entrambi il tuo modo di comportarti"|`|k9wECqJUaa	mandalo a quel paese|`|85910d5da6875ba45ef2aa45980890abaa	Mi dispiace Tea, ma in queste cose il "GENTILMENTE" non esiste!!!<br>  <br>  Ci vuole un diretto "fatti i càzzi tuoi"!!!!<br>  <br>  xDDD|`|j47RimZCaa	Innanzitutto bisogna farlo capire al partner, dopo di chè e lui che deve farglielo capire!

Secondo una ricerca scientifica condotta da una neuropsichiatra californiana (Louann Brizendine) il peso del cervello femminile è di 100gr inferiore rispetto a quello maschile, eppure il numero delle cellule è perfettamente identico.<br>  IL MOTIVO DELLA DIFFERENZA??? La densità delle cellule del cervello maschile è diversa dalla densità delle cellule del cervello del gentil sesso... <br>  <br>  Ma è anche scientificamente provato che vi sono molte differenze tra i "2 cervelli": le donne sono più brave a intuire le emozioni degli altri grazie a un maggior sviluppo della zona dell’insula, cioè l’ippocampo; il cervello femminile percepisce piccoli inconvenienti come catastrofi, a causa della maggior produzione di ormoni estrogeni, cortisolo e dopamina provocando piu spesso stress ed ansia. Nell’uomo, invece, soltanto un pericolo fisico può provocare una reazione simile. Quanto al capitolo sesso, i maschi ci pensano molto più spesso delle donne perché la quantità di testosterone che raggiunge il cervello femminile è 10-100 volte inferiore. Ciò che invece può fare la differenza, per una ragazza, è l’abbraccio: una stretta di 20 secondi stimola la produzione di ossitocina, "l'ormone dell’attaccamento". Cambiando fronte, lo scarso senso dell’orientamento che lui rinfaccia a lei ogni volta che le mette un atlante stradale in mano è legato a uno sviluppo inferiore dall’emisfero destro, deputato alle abilità visive e motorie. Questa metà di cervello è più potente negli uomini, mentre quella sinistra, che ‘arbitra’ la comunicazione, è più attiva nelle donne: per questo motivo lei è maggiormente portata a confidarsi con le amiche e prova piacere a fare gossip. In quanto alle chiacchiere si stima che lei dica circa 20mila parole al giorno, lui appena 7mila..<br>  <br>  Ciao!|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Ma.......... veramente il cervello delle donne è circa 72 g. più piccolo!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Questo non vuol dire che ha meno neuroni!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  Qualcuno ( con battuta di ''spirito'')dirà: SONO MEGLIO COLLEGATI!!!!<br>  Io aggiungo ( alla battuta di spirito): è da ....vedere !!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  XXXXX  <<carciofablu>> è ........quasi..... così, risposta ........tecnica ed  allargata!!!!!<br>  CIAO CIAO

1rryoEPjaa	Oltre ad Associazioni locali, ci sono quelle che operano su scala nazionale.  Va ricordato  il fu, Don Oreste Benzi,  fondatore dell'Associazione Papa Giovanni XXIII°. Tra i vari interventi in ambito sociale, ultimamente aveva lottato propio contro lo sfruttamento della prostituzione. Hanno istituito un numero verde:  800132293 – servirà ad "approfondire un dialogo con coloro che, da favoreggiatori del racket, possono diventare collaboratori per la liberazione delle donne schiavizzate". Un numero che intende aiutare quindi, oltre alle donne sfruttate e schiave della prostituzione, anche "il cliente a risolvere i suoi problemi ed accompagnarlo verso un cambiamento di vita" .<br>  Il Gruppo Abele che fa capo a Don Ciotti, numero di centralino  tel.  011 3841011 -  011 3841066.<br>  A livello nazionale, c'è anche il numero verde 800 290 290 contro la tratta degli esseri umani. E' gratuito ed attivo 24 ore su 24<br>  Dal gennaio 2007 il Numero Verde contro la tratta è stato riattivato dal Dipartimento Diritti e Pari Opportunità della Presidenza del Consiglio dei Ministri .<br>  Il progetto, attivo dal 2000 a supporto delle vittime di tratta a scopo di sfruttamento sessuale, da<br>  quest'anno si rivolge anche alle vittime di tratta per sfruttamento del lavoro, dell’accattonaggio e delle<br>  economie illegali. <br>  E cmq bisognerebbe aiutare anche i clienti, non solo multandoli ma, per chi e vuole uscire da "questa abitudine", bisognerebbe istituire  dei gruppi di sostegno e auto aiuto, tipo" GLI ALCOLISTI ANONIMI". Per gli irremovibili invece, attuare norme e sanzioni più dure. Il violare la dignità di un altro essere umano non ha prezzo...|`|vZF2bl05aa	contro la mafia e la clandestinità|`|0d1b825f1014b36e3eb6b7d1b5d09fcbaa	Innanzitutto va combattuta la domanda.<br>  Se nessuno chiede di andare con queste ragazze...le organizzazioni criminali non avranno nessun interesse ad acquistarle (visto che vengono praticamente COMPRATE).<br>  <br>  Si dovrebbe fare una campagna pubblicitaria battente su questo...chi va con queste povere schiave è colpevole di riduzione in schiavitù, al pari degli aguzzini che le sfruttano.<br>  In un'epoca in cui la televisione ci propina qualsiasi cavolata sarebbe ora di usarla a fin di bene.|`|fd6K3xB3aa	anche amnesty international se ne occupa...|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Tanto di cappello alla fondazione di Don Benzi, Rimini.<br>  Ma......................... sono sempre con i ma...................<br>  vivendo in una zona molto calda, il fenomeno della prostituzione lo vivo giornalmente, vedendo per le strade .................tante cose. <br>  Posso dirti che oggi come oggi, lo sfruttamento è diminuito, ma sono aumentate le prostitute del fai da te!!!!!<br>  <br>  E se le nostre donne ( capissero che l'uomo)...................ha anche un bisogno fisiologico,.................... tutto questo non succederebbe. Invece tra il materialismo e l'idealismo c'è e ci sarà un conflitto eterno.
471fe712f82edb7b6ecbdcaff1bd7a41aa	a me è capitato per puro caso di incontrare la vecchia fiamma del liceo con una compagnia di amici: all'epoca era bella con il suo caschetto rosso e gli occhi azzurri, ma dopo un certo periodo mi lasciò per un avvocato di 11-12 anni più grande di lei (aveva 17 anni ed era senza genitori e viveva dagli zii), dicendomi che si sentiva più sicura. Sono partito dalla città per un lungo periodo e quando son ritornato l'ho reincontrata perchè avevamo amici in comune, ma non mi ha fatto alcun effetto rivederla, faceva parte di un'altra vita.<br>  Abbiamo parlato, io in maniera molto distaccata e lei se n'è accorta e ci è rimasta - forse le è capitato in questi sette anni di pensarmi ogni tanto, ma  avrebbe dovuto pensarci meglio sette anni fa.<br>  Quindi l'indifferenza alla fine è veramente l'arma vincente.|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Certo che se la ferita è da poco rimarginata, è difficilissimo stare calmi, ma se la ferita si è cicatrizzata bene, è solo una che si conosce.

Decisamente l'amore è anche romanticismo e nel romanticismo non entra niente a che fare un coso di plastica attorcigliato ad una parte del proprio corpo.

Anche per non trovare sorprese dopo il matrimonio, infatti molte coppie hanno delle convivenze per provare prima di sposarsi.<br>  Il vanto di essere vergine, non c'è più, anzi l'età della prima volta si è ancora abbassata ( 13/14 anni ) per le donne<br>  Cmq con l'emancipazione, la donna ha smaltellato quell 'impalcatura che durava secoli dell'uomo padrone e sovrano, ha modificato ulteriormente l'uomo nelle sue funzioni: la donna spesso non sa più cosa vuole e non trova il suo punto di riferimento;  mentre l'uomo è molto insicuro, più frustrato.<br>  Forse oggi abbiamo passato una linea immaginaria di eccesso,  riusciamo con molta fatica e con molta sofferenza,<br>   di andare avanti cercando di avere meno problemi possibili. <br>  Questa mia non vuole essere un offesa generalizzata per nessuno,  solo una mia analisi.<br>  <br>  CIAO E BUON NATALE A TUTTI   !!!|`|zgrYlUEoaa	beh la mia ex.... la pensa cosi<br>  <br>  è finita forse anke per quello.....  e me ne pento ancora<br>  <br>  alcune lo fanno per paura.....vedono il matrimonio cm salvezza....credono ke concedersi prima...sia RISKIOSO...sai....temono di essere abbandonate<br>  <br>  altre ci credono davvero....se hanno un ideale religioso potente....e per me sono da ammirare<br>  <br>  ciao ^^

Ecco allora chi, come me, non vuole neanche pensare ad avere pensieri legati a convenienza ed opportunità nel caso in cui il mio rapporto SENTIMENTALE serissimo e radicato, naufraghi.|`|Z55Oonqlaa	perchè la convivenza rappresenta lo stare assieme per amore... il matrimonio potrebbe anche essere uno stare assieme per interesse....|`|ZBATOkEMaa	Io credo che nella maggior parte dei casi la convivenza non sia "preferita" al matrimonio, nel senso che viene comunemente usata come un periodo di rodaggio, per poi giungere al matrimonio.<br>  Il che ti dico, è una splendida idea. Ovviamente è un parere tutto personale.<br>  <br>  Personalmente, sono separata, in attesa di divorzio, convivo.<br>  Ho in progetto un figlio, ma non ho intenzione ad esempio di risposarmi.<br>  Non credo nel matrimonio, tanto meno in quello religioso, in quanto atea, non mi serve una carta per sancire un rapporto.<br>  Non mi sarei nemmeno mai sposata fosse dipeso da me, ma ero una ragazzina, non me ne importava più di tanto e ho "ceduto" al volere del mio ex marito. <br>  Oggi, non lo rifarei (e non lo rifarò).<br>  <br>  Non si tratta di non volere responsabilità, quelle, nel momento stesso in cui dividi la tua vita con un'altra persona, te le devi prendere, carta o non carta.|`|i52GjLkUaa	CREDO CHE LA CONVIVENZA SIA UNA SCORCIATOIA PER NON PRENDERSI LA RESPONSABILITà DI UN MATRIMONIO O PERLOMENO IRLUDERSI DI NON FARLO E DI AVERE EMPRE COSì UN ILLUSORIA INDIPENDENZA.|`|eqVFC71Taa	se non si è religiosi il matrimonio non è poi così necessario...in alcuni casi la convivenza viene preferita per non impegnarsi a fondo...cmq il matrimonio è un legame "a vita"|`|1f023db3e89570f0653cae6cb45b9862aa	perchè se e quando finisce, non devi ingrassare un esercito di avvocati.|`|F0m3NRzzaa	Oggi, con le nuove normative, i 2 partner conviventi, acquisiscono gli stessi diritti e doveri dei 2 coniugi.<br>  Io convivo, da 3 anni, con lui sto bene, benissimo, è la mia anima gemella, ma sogno il matrimonio.<br>  Come? Perché non mi sposo? Perché attualmente non ci sono le risorse finanziarie; pur non volendo fare cerimonia pomposa, ricevimento di lusso, abiti griffati, usando l'auto di un amico, facendo bomboniere e partecipazioni decenti, fotografo professionista ma non "ammazzaconto" ed escludendo il viaggio di nozze, come anche mobili (che abbiamo già) il mio totale viene fuori circa 20 mila €... vi sembra poco?<br>  Ora 2 sono le cose: o mangiamo tutti i giorni o ci sposiamo facendo debiti e andando poi alla caritas, in fila, per una ciotola di minestrone.<br>  Questa è la risposta alla tua domanda.<br>  Ciao!|`|NRdWMB37aa	secondo me è la stessa cosa con l'unica differenza che se le cose non vanno bene risparmi i soldi dell'avvocato|`|shhMuL4Qaa	Perchè puoi sempre cambiare idea senza dover cacciare i soldi per la separazione!|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Personalmente credo che una firma per un contratto non serve, la convivenza la vivo come  un matrimonio, la firma l'abbiamo fatta con i ns. cuori e con le ns teste!!!<br>  Molto è anche la responsabilità ed il rispetto interiore dell'individuo per il/la compagno/a!!!<br>  <br>  PS: certamente se me lo chiede, non posso dirle di NO, perchè verrebbe a mancare una sicurezza interiore!!!!<br>  Forse per i figli    ( futuri)...........................????

sFesIMfCaa	Purtroppo per noi maschi "accoppiarci" è molto più difficile che per le ragazze...la ragazza se non è bruttissima avrà sempre parecchi mosconi che gli girano attorno, e quindi anche se è timida non ha problemi d'approccio perchè viene sempre approcciata da altri....l'unica cosa che deve fare è scegliere nella lista il ragazzo più adatto a lei e che più le piace.<br>  Per l'uomo è diverso: sei tu che devi aprirti, tentare, fare e provare...e non è semplice per niente. Devi superare la timidezza, tampinarle tutte, esercitarti a buttar giù le tue barriere; poi un bel giorno arriverà quella che ti piace e ti ricambia e vi metterete assieme.<br>  Ma il lavoro devi farlo tu, se non ne sei capace rimarrai solo.<br>  Ci sono un sacco di uomini, di 20, 25, 30 anni che non anno mai avuto una ragazza proprio perchè non sanno approcciarsi...e il sapere approcciare è in parte una dote innata, e in parte qualcosa su cui puoi lavorare...quindi lavoraci, e metticela tutta!! (e spera di non fare parte di quella fetta che non sono proprio portati per queste cose e rimangono soli per sempre, ti assicuro che ce n'è parecchi).|`|9a6iNXlvaa	Devi capire l'arte della seduzione, non è facile, io ci ho messo anni, ero sfigato anch'io alla tua età ma ora posso dire di poter avere le donne che voglio. Le regole non sono standard e non le insegnano a scuola, devi fare tu un percorso ed una serie di pensieri per arrivarci, devi capire i tuoi punti forza, cosa può piacere di te alle ragazze, devi darti una tua immagine e scegliere a quale tipo di donna puoi piacere tu e quale tipo di donna piace a te. Una volta centrato questo dovrai capire per come sei come puoi conquistarla, come puoi intrigarla. Ricorda che una donna va intrigata mentalmente, il resto non esiste, lascia perdere chi ti dice che le donne guardano i soldi o il pene di 25 cm. perchè sono tutte balle!! Io senza un soldo ho letteralmente "rubato" donne che stavano con tipo ricchissimi e bellissimi solo perchè le ho intrigate mentalmente. Ho diviso più coppie io del tribunale dei divorzi di Milano.

p2DLh2jnaa	La domanda ha poco senso, che ti frega di misurare quanto bene vuole alla sua famiglia e compararlo con quello che vuole a te? Oltretutto l'amore non si può misurare.<br>  Il punto secondo me è un altro, ovvero questo: tua moglie, sposando te, ha deciso di abbandonare la sua famiglia e formarne un'altra con te, quindi per lei la priorità deve diventare la famiglia nuova (con te), non quella vecchia (i suoi parenti). Per cui può volere quanto bene le pare ai suoi parenti, basta che questo non causi malessere alla nuova famiglia. Ora, il solo fatto che tu ti poni questa domanda indica che c'è già un certo malessere da parte tua, del quale lei dovrebbe preoccuparsi, e anche la famiglia di lei (se sono intelligenti, dovrebbero capire e farsi da parte, per aiutare il legame tra di voi cessando di essere loro una causa di attrito). Parlane con lei.<br>  Tu però cerca di non essere troppo geloso. Il cordone ombelicale che lega una femmina ai propri genitori non si taglia mai del tutto, devi accettare che la porta di casa vostra non si chiuderà mai del tutto, ma resti aperto uno spiraglio nel quale immancabilmente farà capolino la madre di lei... La specie homo sapiens sapiens funziona così, non fargliene una colpa e rassegnatici. Esigi che non si allarghi troppo, ma poi però sii bonario con le interferenze.|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Ma non ti sembra che sono due sentimenti diversi ???<br>  Come puoi misurare il bene verso di te ed il bene verso un parente, la qualità è diversa, non trovi................???<br>  <br>  In questa vita tutto è possibile,................... ma sono due sentimenti diversi di amore, non puoi mettere nella bilancia o me o loro !!!!!!<br>  <br>  Dai, rilassati e parla con tua moglie........<br>  <br>  ciao ciao|`|LPUz31rTaa	ma gia' la dovresti capire dal fatto che:la mattina toglie da ogni parte della casa ogni pezzo del tuo vestiario,ke ti deve sopportare la sera,(sempre sè la sera te non 6 stanco),il sabato e la domenica 24ore24,gridare a destra a sinistra....il farvi delle coccole,l addormentarsi con te la sera,il cucinarti,ecc...penso che tutte queste cose tua moglie non li fa' con i suoi parenti,non credi???P.S(bhè mi sono mesa nei panni di tua moglie,dato ke mio marito ogni tanto mi  fa' anke domande del genere)....kiss

Se non è ancora maturata la soluzione giusta per un problema posso essere certa che essa mi apparirà chiara al momento giusto. Quando sono indecisa vuol dire che per me non è ancora il momento di agire".

Considero que el problema no consiste en aguantarte a tener solo una amistad con tu "amigo", sino más bien, estás buscando la forma en la que puedas ser verdaderamente franca con tus sentimientos hacia él.<br>  <br>  Recuerda que la amistad es increible, pero un noviazgo es todavía más bonito. Y lo mejor de todo es que, de acuerdo a lo que dices, él también siente algo por tí.<br>  <br>  Definitivamente no te puedo garantizar que si el noviazgo no funiciona, puedan continuar con su amistad; pero vale la pena correr el riesgo.... Animate y verás que no es tan difícil como aparenta..... Puedes empezar por decirle cómo te sientes cuando estás con él y recuerda que hoy en día no es necesario que el hombre dé el primer paso.....

Fake it until you make it.|`|5db14b93b6f8b7df5274c10511ae863baa	as no one has really asked, no one really knows. but i could care less - as i don't really know myself totally.|`|1e28a4a30ea57de9679f2abae7bee792aa	i guess a lot of it has to do with the people you know and how much you are willing to share. every relationship you have with someone, it's always different. there are things you would tell one person but not another. sometimes its harder to talk to friends but easier to a partner. maybe you just havent found the right person you can totally be comfortable around with and someone who isnt going to judge you- for just being simply you.|`|AA10207977	i used to be like this, until four years ago i met really good friend and now after four years of friendship he known me very well ... and i tell him everything i have a problem here in life, and he knew everything about me that even my parents or a close friends here don't ... and it realllllllly healthy thing cuz if something bothering you and you just kept it trapped inside you it will reflected in a bad way in your soul, temper and even your health .... so i just hope you find someone of your friends that trustworthy enought that you can speak your mind out with him sometime .... <br>  <br>  i hope this helped a little|`|f3c0cdc1cb419a11a77421cb625a5a57aa	I guess I also consider myself pretty private. I have problems opening up and trusting people with my secrets because I don't want to be hurt in the future. I also feel like people only see what they want to, and if they truly knew how messed up my head was they wouldn't care or wouldn't look at me the same. Everyone feels like this at some point I think. But either way, I'm fucked up too, so I guess you aren't alone at feeling lonely.

If he denies it, find out if he really dosn't like her, then take your chance at it and tell him!

3c18ea111841c2d40318785743b796c6aa	Your friend is going to continue being played because she obviously still has feelings for him.  Unfortunately, the reason why you ran out of words is because it doesn't matter what you tell her.  She'd take him back in heartbeat.  Explain (as your probably have already) that if he loved her, he would respect her.  Talking to numerous other girls shows that he is selfish, immature and that he does not care for her.  After that, there is nothing else you can say.  Unfortunately, you cannot stop your friend from making mistakes or teach her to respect herself enough by not putting up with this crap.  Eventually she'll learn.  The only thing you can do is listen and be honest.  After that, it's up to you how much time you want to spend talking about it with her.  She's looking for something that isn't there.  Hopefully she'll come to her senses before she drives you nuts!|`|6qAOPTh9aa	try setting ur friend up w another guy so she can try to forget that loser she calls a bf. like the saying goes 'out of sight out of mind' it sometimes works w ppl to.|`|d3MDMd98aa	If there's one thing I've learned in life, it's that when girls ask for advice about their d-bag boyfriends, they're not looking for the truth.  They're fishing for what they want to hear.  And no matter what you ever say, she will end up doing whatever she wants anyways.  Best advice I can give - don't stress about it.  It's her life, her choice, and probably her mistake that she'll learn a valuable lesson from.  Next time she asks, just tell her to do whatever she wants.  Because thats what is going to happen anyways.|`|BLzeagzhaa	If your girlfriend broke up with her boyfriend because of girls he was talking to, the relationship will never, ever work because this particular relationship/boy is making her feel insecure and jealous.<br>  <br>  Simply ask your girlfriend:<br>  "Do you like the feeling you get when you see or hear that he has been talking to these girls?"<br>  "Do you want to feel like that for the rest of your life?"<br>  "Wouldn't you rather find another boyfriend who you can trust who doesn't make you feel so terrible?"<br>  "Are you willing to give up possible future relationships which would be happier for this one that makes you upset?"<br>  <br>  Tell your friend if she stays with this boy, she will never be happy because he doesn't care about how his actions make her feel.<br>  <br>  Be a good friend and keep asking her: "What would you be advising me if it were me instead of you!"<br>  <br>  Good luck!
XnDrsQdjaa	la verdad en mi opinion no creeo q puedas dejar de querer a alguien voluntaria mente lo puedes odiar pero no dejarlo de quere ahora si q caemos al classico el tiempo lo cura todo pero si quieres un consejo trata de no pensar tanto en esa persona a la q quires olvidar aunque suene imposible cuidate bye y q te vaya bien.|`|637e874041ef852e0709edb57bc2fcf8aa	Cómo dejar de querer a alguien?  Tomando la decisión, si suena y es más fácil decirlo que hacerlo, pero es el primer paso para sacar de tu vida a alguien que sólo te lastima. Buscar apoyo en amigos y familia es otro paso que debes dar, no encerrarte y tampoco iniciar relaciones por "olvidar" a esa persona, porque lo único que harás son comparaciones que te llevarán a extra?ar más a ese alguien.

Lui si fidava di te e adesso non si fida più. <br>  Sicuramente è ancora attratto FISICAMENTE da te, ma non sei più la creatura da proteggere, cosa che faceva si che lui ti AMASSE. Tu sei quella che si è sc......ta un altro. Per un maschio una cosa del genere è devastante... è come averlo castrato. Adesso che lo hai tradito te la vuole far pagare... deve riaffermare che lui è il maschio e che nessuna donna lo tradisce. QUINDI: Non riuscirai a riconquistarlo con bigliettini e parole. Ricorda che lo hai ferito nel suo orgoglio e non solo. Se vuole andare via, devi lasciarlo fare, e se andrà con qualcun'altra, lascialo fare. Anzi, prima lo fa meglio è. D'altra parte te la sei cercata, mettiti l'anima in pace, per adesso. Poi, quando si sarà sfogato, si sentirà in colpa e sarà arrabbiato con te perchè gli hai distrutto un sogno, ma se dentro di se ti ama, tornerà.

Infine ti dico che riconquistare un uomo che hai tradito in passato è un impresa molto ardua, specialmente se ha un carattere forte e testardo... Non offenderti ma io probabilmente non ritornerei mai con una donna che mi ha tradito. Buona fortuna...|`|Xdqm38euaa	Oh ragà capisco ke non condividiate il suo atteggiamento,non lo condivido manco io,ma non c'è bisogno di darle addosso ora,penso ke la situazione la stia già facendo soffrire abbastanza...<br>  Io credo ke lui sia rimasto davvero molto male per ciò ke hai fatto,e ke magari ha influito sul suo sentimento...tu al suo posto cosa faresti!?Magari si è reso conto ke non si fida più,o non vuole stare più con te...diciamo ke è abbastanza normale,avrebbe pure potuto lasciarti subito,invece ha voluto riprovarci,però non riesce + a stare bene con te!<br>  Per quanto riguarda la questione del sesso...se non è più innamorato come dice forse vuole restare con te in quei momenti xkè gli piace...e basta...<br>  Mi dispiace,ma non credo ke ci sia un modo per riconquistarlo,visto ke cmq è stato così chiaro...|`|ZDwdMofaaa	TI AMA, MA NON SI FIDA PIù DI TE... è NORMALE..<br>  CONTINUA A TENTARE DI RICONQUISTARE LA SUA FIDUCIA|`|c26d4845707147b6340860c7587ffcd2aa	penso che se tu l'hai tradito AVEVI SICURAMENTE LE TUE BUONE RAGIONI.....ora lui e' tornato da te e ti sta lasciando x ripicca....amore mio fai male a corrergli dietro...stai a sentire a me...non lo dar retta piu' di tanto e inizia a cercarti un altro uomo.....senti a me fai cosi'....CHIODO SCACCIA CHIODO...non inzerbinarti...trovati un altro e cerca di essere felice con lui...|`|spwybhBIaa	penso che fra di voi non finirà mai. ho conosciuto persone che sono andate avanti così per anni, non è certo una cosa tranquilla, ma anche questa è vita! cerca però di non tradirlo più.|`|tcYQ4Etfaa	cara mia...se un anno fa lo hai tradito tu...forse perchè già qualcosa nn funzionava...poi un rapporto così non lo riconquisti subito...rassegnati...altri lidi ti aspettano...e non sei sola...il mondo è pieno di casi come il tuo.|`|vIASBMUdaa	fa l'amore con te forse sei brava a letto ? scherzi a parte non credo proprio che ci sia modo per riconquistarlo quanto una cosa è finita è finita e basta non tutti sono in grado di perdonare dimenticando tutto lui ci ha provato . una domanda tu come facevi afare l'amore con l'altro se non ne eri innamorata? o forse lo eri? buona fortuna ne hai davvero bisogno mi dispiace solo per la piccola|`|zFMABAn2aa	Che facciate l'amore 3 volte a settimana non credo significhi che ti ama... magari prova attrazione x te, questo sì ma l'amore è un'altra cosa.<br>  Purtroppo se è così convinto di voler chiudere il vostro matrimonio e non cede nemmeno davanti ai tuoi tentativi e alla bimba evidentemente non ti ama davvero +, mi spiace.

Vero??? Adesso ti sei accorta che lo ami... ma lui si è accorto che non ti ama piu'-- dove è il problema?<br>  Lui pero' non ti ha tradita---- l'unica soluzione che vedo è la separazione perchè è troppo comodo adesso...<br>  e se fate l'amore 3 volte alla settimana puo' essere per lui solo uno sfogo.. sai come è...|`|ffb5ae6af63017c1d04b0eceac0d6807aa	posso capire tuo marito che ormai ha perso la fiducia in te. Ci dovevi pensare prima. Per quanto riguarda il sesso lui lo fà solo per liberarsi...è brutto da dire ma per gli uomini ragionare con l'organo è molto facile. Non è amore è solo sesso......Pazienza cercate di trovare un accordo per la piccola|`|QTJLBxgGaa	Non hai mai pensato che forse fa l'amore con te per umiliarti e per dimostrare a sè stesso che ha ancora il potere di farti godere e te lo conferma dicendoti che non ti ama più.<br>  Mi dispiace, ma te la sei cercata, con una bimba di un anno e mezzo non si va in giro a s.c.o.p.a.r.e. con l'amante. Dovevi pensare a crescere tua figlia. Comprendo benissimo tuo marito, perchè so, purtroppo quello che si prova ad essere traditi. NON SI DIMENTICA PIU'.<br>  Un consiglio? Lascialo andare, gli hai rovinato la vita e NON usare la bambina come arma di ricatto.<br>  Questo almeno glielo devi!|`|TLN86Xbraa	io credo che lo dovresti lasciare in pace, che si rifaccia una vita, non si fiderebbe mai più di te!|`|VD4Z0AJxaa	prima a te non interessava ora tu non interessi a lui....discorso fila in maniera perfetta|`|eHHKoWWuaa	E' un traditore ed un'ipocrita.Lascialo.|`|iR82kBqvaa	Propongo una pausa perchè tutti e due dovete capire bene a che punto siete e che cosa volete fare. Tradire è una cosa orribile e sbagliata, ma bisogna cercare di capire le motivazioni che c'erano dietro. A volte dietro un tradimento c'è disamore, a volte depressione, a volte la sensazione di essere date per scontate...interrogati bene. Di solito però se una donna per prima tradisce è perchè non è più innamorata! Per noi femminucce spesso sesso e cuore vanno di pari passo. Il fatto che tuo marito faccia sesso con te non dice nulla...gli uomini hanno un approccio più crudo con la questione, sta cosa non la capiremo mai!!<br>  E lui? A botta calda ti ama e ti perdona e dopo un anno non ti ama più: non si sarà per caso trovato lui una sostituta?<br>  Tu ti disperi perchè davvero lo ami e sei pentita o perchè ti spaventa la prospettiva di una vita da sola con una bimba da crescere....con minori risorse economiche, o considerazioni simili? Fate chiarezza innanzitutto con voi stessi, ripeto: e tu non essere assillante, smettila di stargli addosso come una zecca e guai a te se ti fai vedere a piangere! Coltiva le amicizie, vai a trovare i parenti, fai sport, gioca con tua figlia, insomma dedicati a te stessa in un momento importante come questo, in cui cerchi di capire che cosa vuoi dalla vita.<br>  Fatti vedere carina e più serena possibile. Gli uomini detestano il ricatto emotivo della donna piagnona!!!<br>  Se deciderete che davvero volete stare insieme, sarà perchè l'avete deciso voi e non perchè qualcuno è stato messo con le spalle al muro. Se uno dei due vorrà prendere un'altra strada, pensa che potrebbe anche essere quella che porta alla felicità.<br>  Coraggio e...positività! la tua bimba non si merita una mamma depressa.<br>  Un bacione...|`|kAP1VYmTaa	chi semina vento prima o poi raccoglierà tempesta!|`|v7KHUukdaa	Sicuramente se lo hai tradito ti mancava qualcosa da parte sua.. quindi io non sto a giudicarti a differenza di come fanno molti. Se lui non ti ama più che puoi fare.. secondo te è bello stare accanto ad una persona che non ti ama? non penso che tu abbia bisogno di questo. Comunque se hai dubbi circa il fatto che ti ami ancora affronta il discorso per bene faccia a faccia con lui e se ti ama ancora.. non ti lascia tranquilla.. se l' amore è invece svanito.. come si fa a riconquistarlo? scusa la franchezza ma nn penso sia possibile.|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Quando si racconta al proprio patner il tradimento fatto, si trasferisce il peso della colpa all'altro, liberandosi..<br>  Lui ha provato ancora di stare con te (quasi un anno) Ma gli manca la serenità, troppo rancore, che faccia 2 o 3 volte l'amore con te....... non arrampicarti nei specchi, nn serve, piedi per terra. Se negavi era molto meglio!!!!<br>  Adesso non può dire che nn ti ama più, è colpito nell'orgoglio nell'anima, il rancore sarà troppo forte ancora.<br>  Lascialo vivere in pace, non soffocarlo non opprimerlo, chiedere perdono  nn serve a niente. Solo lui con se stesso può decidere se tornare da te o no!!!!! La bambina: questo si che sarà un problema, mi auguro per voi di non utilizzarla per ricatti che lei nn centra niente con voi, non ha chiesto lei questi genitori!!!!!

Sii felice e serena e dai anche a loro la possibilità di vederlo nei tuoi occhi e di esserlo a loro volta.

Ci sono persone (uomini) che cercano la propria donna che abbia dei principi, ma più che altro dei valori. Perdere la propria verginità con l'uomo che si ama non è un peccato o un reato, poi l'amore può finire e... nessuno sa il futuro. Però l'importante (almeno per me) e trovare una donna che crede nell'amore, odio le donne facili e mai ne vorrei una. Accetterei le sue esperienze così come io ho le mie, e non mi interessa se sia esperta nel fare sesso o no, anzi sarebbe più bello farle insieme, con rispetto, amore e fiducia. Bisogna aver consapevolezza del valore del proprio corpo e della propria anima. Per concludere...bisogna amarsi e rispettarsi, il resto non conta.|`|yiWT748Eaa	Innanzitutto buonasera...mi chiamo Giada...<br>  Spero di esserti 1 pochino utile... :-)<br>  Una volta vigeva la regola di non fare nulla prima del matrimonio....

Vivila a tuo piacimento... Ama se te lo dice il tuo cuore... Fai ogni cosa che ti senti di fare...  Magari guardandoti indietro sul tuo errore un po' ti arrabbierai..ma se in quel momento che ti senti felice e realizzata ti senti di comportarti in tale modo... Fallo...

prc80dZqaa	Ciao, mi dispiace tanto per la tua situazione, è sempre brutto arrivare al "si rifiuta di DARMI le bambine" (che cmq non sono pacchi). Io ti capisco e penso tu abbia tutto il diritto di vederle e di farle stare con la tua nuova compagna, forse un po' meno di portarle all'estero dalla famiglia di lei (probabilmente è questo che alla tua ex-moglie dà noia), e credo che senza il consenso della madre (non è solo la tua ex, è la madre delle bambine) le bambine non possano allontanarsi dall'Italia. Lo so che non ti sembra giusto, ma penso che ti convenga non inimicarti madre e figlie, quindi se non resci a farla ragionare, forse o parti da solo con la tua nuova compagna, o forse puoi per il momento lasciar perdere e riprovare magari l'anno prossimo (o vedere se vengono i tuoi nuovi familiari o suoceri in Italia per conoscerle, sempre se possono). Passa un bel natale o capodanno con loro (e con la tua nuova compagna se non parte), rinsaldate il vostro legame, e tra un po' di mesi riproponi il viaggio in Irlanda... anche la tua nuova compagna ci resterà male, ma probabilmente capirà che per te prima vengono le figlie... perchè è così vero? Saluti ed auguri!<br>  <br>  ... ah, allora se hai aggiunto che andate là perché c'è sua figlia che partorisce, il motivo è ben più serio di una semplice vacanza... cerca di farlo capire alla tua ex moglie, ma evitate le liti a maggior ragione perché c'è una nuova nascita "nell'aria"... meglio che la situazione resti pacifica per un po'! Auguri anche per il piccolino o la piccolina in arrivo, allora!|`|AfL636Lkaa	Purtroppo per andare all'estero devi avere il suo consenso.

I can give you some pointers on how to help yourself though.<br>  The main point in trying to get people to like you is to be yourself. There will always be someone that likes you when you act the way you are, and there will always be someone else who is like you in someway. Like having the same interests. Another thing is to be nice to the people you talk to. People always can use someone nice to talk to. Also, don't be shy to get out there be outgoing and talk to people. <br>  If you do those things then you should get a friends that like you in know time.|`|M3nofr9taa	Smile, be interested in them more than you, show appriciation, and dont critisize.|`|NkNVtvWRaa	sometimes its best not to speak your mind dont get me wrong sometime you have too but others let it slide i would just be nive and try and help pp when they need it and become involved in groups|`|ldTUdo8Jaa	Be yourself, have confidence, and smile. <br>  If they can't like you for that theres no point in being friends.

E’ il terzo stadio, dopo la fase di plateau nel rapporto sessuale, a cui normalmente segue una fase di rilassamento della tensione sessuale. Durante l'orgasmo, sia nei maschi che nelle femmine, si verificano contrazioni muscolari dell’ano e dei muscoli pelvici, così come degli organi sessuali.<br>  Nella femmina, l’orgasmo è preceduto da una lubrificazione delle pareti vaginali e da una dilatazione del clitoride dovuta ad un aumento del flusso sanguigno che rimane nel tessuto spugnoso che lo compone. Alcune donne manifestano un arrossamento diffuso della pelle dovuto ad una aumento del flusso sanguigno. Ma mano che la donna si avvicina all’orgasmo, il clitoride si muove verso l’interno e le piccole labbra assumono una colorazione più scura. Quando l’orgasmo diviene imminente, la vagina diminuisce di dimensioni di circa il 30% e viene irrorata di sangue e il clitoride si ritira sotto il cappuccio protettivo e riemerge solo quando la stimolazione ha termine. Durante l’orgasmo l’utero, la vagina e i muscoli pelvici hanno una serie di contrazioni ritmiche. Dopo che l’orgasmo è finito, il clitoride riemerge e recupera, in circa 10 minuti, le  proprie normali dimensioni. A differenza dell’uomo, la donna non ha un periodo refrattario e perciò può avere un secondo orgasmo subito dopo il primo (alcune donne possono averne 3 o 4): ciò è noto come orgasmo multiplo. Studi mostrano che circa il 13% delle donne hanno avuto esperienze di orgasmi multipli. L’orgasmo per la donna, come per l’uomo, può essere associato ad azioni involontarie, vocalizzazioni o spasmi muscolari in altre parti del corpo. Generalmente è associato con una generale sensazione di euforia.<br>  <br>  "Eiaculazione" femminile<br>  Molte donne durante l’orgasmo espellono del fluido. L’origine di tale fluido sono le ghiandole di Skene localizzate attorno al meato uretrale. Queste ghiandole hanno le dimensioni di una capocchia di spillo e possono variare da soggetto a soggetto ed anche non essere presenti. Questo spiega l'assenza di questo fenomeno in alcune donne.<br>  <br>  Perché si verifica l’orgasmo<br>  In termini evolutivi è chiaro che l’orgasmo maschile è necessario per la riproduzione in quanto associato all’eiaculazione. Per l’orgasmo femminile le teorie Darwiniane sono meno dirette: alcuni autori sostengono che contribuisca alla ritenzione dello sperma all’interno, aumentando le possibilità di fecondazione.In termini evolutivi è chiaro che l’orgasmo maschile è necessario per la riproduzione in quanto associato all’eiaculazione. Per l’orgasmo femminile le teorie Darwiniane sono meno dirette: alcuni autori sostengono che contribuisca alla ritenzione dello sperma all’interno, aumentando le possibilità di fecondazione.<br>  <br>  Orgasmo vaginale e clitorideo<br>  Bisogna premettere che non ci sono due differenti tipi di orgasmo, può cambiare soltanto il tipo di stimolazione per raggiungerlo. Il clitoride è molto sensibile alle stimolazioni. Può essere stimolato in vari modi, con stimoli manuali o attraverso una pressione e sfregamento con il corpo del partner. Alcune donne provano dolore in presenza di stimolazione diretta. Una migliore stimolazione si ha con la donna sopra in posizione tale che il clitoride si sfreghi con l’osso pubico dell’uomo. Questo peraltro si verifica anche quando è l’uomo a stare sopra in una posizione tale che l’osso pubico eserciti pressione nella zona clitoridea. Per alcune donne la parte esterna della vagina è anche molto sensibile. Questo viene riferito come "orgasmo vaginale".<br>  In termini evolutivi è chiaro che l’orgasmo maschile è necessario per la riproduzione in quanto associato all’eiaculazione.

In realtà l’orgasmo è un’esperienza individuale e non c’è un percorso "corretto" per raggiungerlo. <br>  <br>  un consiglio:per raggiungere l'orgasmo durante il rapporto mettiti sopra in questa maniera ci sarà la stimolazione del clitoride!provare x credere!è difficile provare l'orgasmo vaginale sono davvero poche le donne che possono vantarlo, nn temere sei normalissima|`|RkhsbAEraa	ma guarda c'è una bambina di 12 anni k si chiedeva la stessa cosa..|`|SwMaPRvZaa	-O mio dio hanno ammazzato kenny!-<br>  -brutti bastardi!-|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Il ''Pipino troppo piccolo''??<br>  Ne basterebbe solo 8 cm.

2sJUGqddaa	Ciao..hai perfettamente ragione!!! Ma gli uomini vengono ritenuti in tal modo...perchè molte persone pensano siano sfigati, dei verginelli, dei poveri ragazzi che non sono stati in grado di "centrare il buco" cosa molto patetica!!!! Le ragazze, se perdono la verginità..sono considerate delle poco di buono..cosa stupida!!! I ragazzi possono farsi tutte le ragazze del mondo e sono dei fighetti mentre le ragazze sono ritenute delle t...!!!

Siamo tutti uguali!|`|Udl31ICmaa	forse è cambiato tutto--non so se il ragazzo apprezza ancora tanto la ragazza vergine io lo spero ma sento dire che alcuni fuggono da responsabilità--l'uomo ha sempre dovuto dimostrare la propria virilità--entrambi devono farlo quando sentono che è l'incontro giusto per iniziare un nuova vita fatta di amore e sesso --non per sfogo---|`|naeLKhhVaa	perche gli uomini sono maschilisti e **** vuol dire forza mentre invece a noi siamo***********|`|slkbeEfsaa	xkè semplicemente la gente nn si fa e pensa ai C@zzi suoi??!!!|`|0UaojKAxaa	secondo me se una è vergine nn la stimano. anzi la considerano male xkè nn ha esperienza ecc..|`|BsImt1L3aa	e la societa'......cmq dovrebbe essere uguale|`|K1hSGX2laa	Oggi c'è la tendenza alla parità, ma abbiamo ancora una certa eredità dei valori passati.<br>  <br>  La donna doveva essere casta perchè era costretta ad uniformarsi ai valori religiosi, ad immagine della Madonna.<br>  Per gli uomini l'ispirazione a Gesù era solo a livello formale, non avendo un altra categoria ad imporre qualcosa era libero di seguire i suoi istinti, quali la virilità.

Ti dico che in passato anche io ho fatto la stessa cosa per un periodo di tempo, pensi che riuscirai a riconquistarlo, che prima o poi capirai quanto puoi essere importante anche tu per lui ma ti dico che non sempre funziona così! Ho continuato a farlo pur sapendo che prima o poi avrei dovuto farmene una ragione, ed infatti un giorno così all'improvviso, hod eciso che non poteva andare e che dovevo darci un taglio, perchè andando avanti così avrei finito per soffrire di piu! Sai cosa devi pensare? che magari ora stai bene ma la sensazione è soltanto illusoria in quanto se domani lui dovesse conoscere qualcuna, non credo ci penserebbe due volte in quanto, come tu scrivi, non ti ama più e non si sente in dovere di portare rispetto ad un sentimento e ad una storia che non c'è!

ESUG1zZZaa	Sai leggendo la tua domanda mi sono venuti le lacrime ai occhi... Ma come possono esistere persone crudeli... Voglio raccontarti una storia... Ad una mia amica è successo la stesssa cosa anzi di peggio perché lei non era ubriaca. Mi ha raccontato che un amico del suo ragazzo l'aveva invitato a pranzo e lei per non essere scortese aveva accettato. Però quel ragazzo si è spinto oltre fin troppo. La violentata.. la mia amica era distrutta non voleva vedere nessuno e evitava pure il suo ragazzo. Lei non voleva vedere il suo ragazzo perché era insicura era insicura del fatto che lui non la voleva più per quello che è successo. Il ragazzo però non si è dato pace e alla fine quando aveva scoperto cosa era successo è andato dal ragazzo che gli aveva fatto del male. Per fortuna che l'hanno fermato se no chissà che cosa avrebbe potuto fare. Dopo il ragazzo ha preso la mia amica è sono scapati da tutti e da tutti. Però i genitori riuscirono a trovarli. Comunque sai come la mia amica è riuscita ad andare avanti??? Per prima cosa è andata da quel ragazzo è gli ha detto che non poteva più sconfiggersi da un vigliacco come lui. Perché LUI AVRà ANCHE ABUSATO DEL SUO CORPO MA DI SICURO NON è RIUSCITO A TOCCARE IL SUO CUORE. Anche se le ferite che quel ragazzo gli ha provocato la accompagnerà fino alla fine dei suoi giorni la faranno diventare ancora più forti perché quella ragazza ha cose molto più importanti da tutelare. Quella ragazza si è impostato di essere più forte non solo per se stessa ma anche per il suo ragazzo e per tutte le persone a lei care perché lei non voleva farsi piegare da mezzi così vili. Da allora la mia amica ha ricominciato da capo. Sono sicurissima che anche tu ce l'ha farai perché hai tante persone accanto a te che ti vogliono bene soprattutto il tuo ragazzo quindi cerca di aprire completamente il tuo cuore al tuo ragazzo e lascia che sia lui a prendersi cura di te e vedrai che tutto andrà meglio. Comunque io spero tanto che tutto si risolva e non posso dirti altro che buona fortuna....|`|R0PVSeFFaa	Hai fatto bene a sporgere denuncia, ma ora c'è un altro problema da trattare:te.

avYDHAuIaa	Allora questo dipende da varie cose...prima di tutto dall'elastacità dell'imene...se è molto elastico è difficile che si rompa già dalla prima volta...poi ti potresti accorgere se si rompe anche dal fatto delle perdite di sangue (anche se non a tutte le ragazze succede...ad alcune si e ad altre no).<br>  Cmq ho sentito dire che con la chirurgia plastica è possibile riacquistare la verginità...<br>  cmq la verginità molte volte è più una questione mentale che fisica...pensaci...ciao|`|rglgnPK0aa	nono|`|93cc4e5aa378db3d8e3137c95154b7dbaa	Sì...nel naso...|`|GRtryrp4aa	non credo|`|rLWKDMMmaa	rivolgendosi ad un chirurgo plastico x farsela ricucire :)|`|tIFwx57Zaa	l'ho letto sulle risposte alle lettere di un giornale....sono date da un ginecologo quindi penso che siano attendibili...cmq sul giornale dice di si...magari il tuo imene è abbastanza elastico da non rompersi con la penetrazione...ciao baci|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Se il tuo imene è abbastanza elastico, è possibile.<br>  Ma anche se il tuo LUI ha l'affarino piccino piccino!!!!<br>  Ne bastano solo OTTO centimetri per......................<br>  fare  l'amore!!!!!<br>  CMQ AUGUR (con otto)I!!!|`|C2GXsjKBaa	se lo hai già fatto ormai la verginità è persa niente da fare|`|H5jCHjhaaa	si è possibilissimo...<br>  capita spesso a causa dell'elasticità della membrana che dovrebbe lacerarsi...|`|NPIAfgwPaa	Direi proprio di no a meno che non si sia fermato a contatto dell'imene!So che c'e' gente che per rimanere vergine fa i rapporti così.....|`|QFWd8DZ3aa	se sei Chuck Norris tutto è possibile|`|QZO11U01aa	no... quando fai sesso nn sei piu vergine|`|SVbIdRVXaa	dunque...essere vergini vuol dire che non lo si è mai fatto..nelle donne, di solito, si ha rottura dell'imene al primo rapporto sessuale, quindi nell'accezione comune si considera vergine una donna con l'imene ancora integro, però ci sono delle considerazioni da fare:<br>  1) non tutte le donne hanno l'imene<br>  2) non sempre si lacera completamente al primo rapporto<br>  3) a volte può essere talmente fragile che si può lacerare in altri modi (urti, etc.)<br>  4) oggi esiste anche la plastica, in cui si ricostruisce artificialmente la membrana<br>  <br>  Quando si lacera, di solito, c'è perdita di sangue, ma non sempre avviene, però un ginecologo ti può dire se si è lacerato completamente oppure no.<br>  Detto questo, la verginità è secondo me una questione molto personale, se sai che lo hai fatto non sei più vergine...far dipendere tutto da una membrana che hanno la maggior parte delle donne, ma non tutte, che senso ha?<br>  Nell'uomo, che non ha imene , la verginità si perde con il primo rapporto...e probabilmente sarebbe ora di estendere questo concetto anche alle donne che per secoli hanno subito umiliazioni perché anche se vergini non perdevano sangue al primo rapporto e non macchiavano il letto e così le si considerava impure sospettando che avessero consumato prima del matrimonio...<br>  purtroppo in alcuni paesi è ancora così :S|`|uRAheBY0aa	Si è possibile...Konosko persone a kui è kapitato|`|JuXBXK4Gaa	no se lo hai già fatto completo...|`|M5GcPFAKaa	no!it's impossible!|`|NCnOahdXaa	forse|`|X8ItLGl2aa	Si si è possibile, ti riferisce al famoso filo che nn si rompe? succede nn spesso ma succede! se l'hai fatto solo una volta nn preoccuparti puo darsi si rompa in futuro ma se nn si rompe vai da uno specialista per un piccolo intervento|`|YD3TK9Pzaa	no solo nel caso che sei molto elastica, ma non penso proprio sia il tuo caso.

xbmxVmxzaa	Ti posso consigliarti, il Ristorante IL GESTORE, a Varese: immerso in un parco ( circa 3 ettari) con molta vegetazione ed alberi secolari, ex villa Malerba, puoi fare il pranzo fuori, ma se il tempo non lo permette, hanno delle salette interessanti in villa e ci possono stare comodamente 80 pers.  se poi si puo usare il terrazzo chiuso si arriva, penso anche a 140/150 pers.<br>  So perfettamente che non è nella tua provincia, ma..............<br>  ne vale la pena andare a vederlo, sia come menù che come posto.<br>  Si trova vicino all'ippodromo.<br>  Poi fammi sapere!!!!!

TLQJgafvaa	io ho tradito il mio primo ragazzo serio... è stato solo un bacio nulla di + ma è stato devastante, quando me ne sono resa conto non è bastato un anno e mezzo di storia perchè lui mi perdonasse.... d'altronde io non ho voluto troncare quando lui aveva provato a dirmelo, soffrivamo entrambi a lasciarci, xò stando con me non si è + fidato, sebbene io avevo talgliato i ponti con chiunque potesse recargli sospetto, mi ero "inzerbinita" parecchio, non sto nemmeno a raccontarvi le cose ke ero disposta a fare (e ke alla fine facevo) per lui pur di fare in modo ke lui non sospettasse ancora di me... e lui nel frattempo un po' ci soffriva per questa situazione, ma un po' anke ci sguazzava xkè si poteva permettere messaggi, squilli e telefonate sospette senza ke io avessi il diritto di dirgli nulla... mi ha fatto sentire in colpa per un anno e mezzo, per me era la mia prima storia e non sapevo neanke bene come comportarmi.... forse avrei dovuto avere le palle per dirgli ke non mi doveva rinfacciare il mio errore ad ogni litigata xò d'altronde nel torto ero io... sta di fatto ke quando mi ha lasciata mi è caduto il mondo addosso, mi ha ripetuto per l'ennesima volta ke non si era mai + fidato di me senza nemmeno accennare a tutti i sacrifici ke io avevo fatto per lui...come se non avessi praticamente fatto nulla....per lui io mi ero macchiata solo di una grande colpa ke gli proibiva di vedere tutto l'affetto ke io gli avevo dato.... sono rimasta sola senza amici.... Per fortuna ke a salvarmi è arrivato un angelo, ke da 5 anni rende perfette le mie giornate e non fa mai sparire il sorriso dal mio viso.... Con lui mi sono ripromessa di non rifare lo stesso errore...è stata una rivincita, uno sbaglio dal quale non puoi ke trarre esperienza, uno sbaglio da non rifare dato ke hai conosciuto il rispetto. E la felicità non può ke aumentare di giorno in giorno...senza scheletri nell'armadio.|`|01vXPXupaa	se la vostra storia passata e stata magica,prima del tradimento.....bè fidati ti saprà perdonare...ma dagli il tempo di riflettere...non essere ossessiva nei suoi comfronti.<br>  e spero per te che hai capito lo sbaglio fatto in precedenza.<br>  buona fortuna.|`|ZMKTRb8iaa	solo col tempo..piano piano....nn essere ossessiva ed oppressiva ;)<br>  in bocca al lupo|`|ZqsuQ337aa	Dagli il tempo di metabolizzare il tradimento, senza ossessionarlo e anche tu datti questo tempo, per capire perchè lo hai fatto, per sport, perchè in realtà anche lui ha delle responsabilità....Non lo so e non ti giudico.

Per il resto dimenticalo ci sono altri ragazzi molto migliori!|`|BB6B1l2Uaa	Sinceramente, un ragazzo così, meglio perderlo che trovarlo.<br>  Io la vedo così. Non ho idea di quanti anni abbia tu e nemmeno lui, però una persona che lascia che siano gli amici a "decidere" per lui con chi stare.... non dimostra di avere una grande maturità! e nemmeno lasciandoti per SMS lo dimostra! Cerca un ragazzo che sappia apprezzare il tuo modo di essere senza che siano gli amici a proferir giudizio e fossi in te, eviterei di cercare dei chiarimenti con lui. Non ne vale nemmeno la pena!|`|GdbVBo72aa	Devi chiarire, così lo tranquillizzi e ti togli il pensiero.|`|cOg7ZdoXaa	prima cosa uno che ti lascia x messaggio è un codardo e poi se ci teneva a te di certo non si faceva influenzare dai suoi amici,lascialo perdere e trova una persona seria che non si fa influenzare dal gregge

E575lFefaa	Ma si...perchè no? L'amore non ha età...sarà un modo di dire banale ma è vero. Se ti innamori di un uomo o di una donna molto più grandi o più piccoli vuol dire che hanno qualcosa che cerchi. Tuttavia, nella maggior parte dei casi si tratta di lei che cerca soldi o una residenza in Italia e di lui che è una sorta di rimbambito con la sindrome di peter pan convinto che la sua "ragazzina" lo ami anche se è un grasso c.e.s.s.o di 80 anni e per di più pedofilo e porco...<br>  Questo nel 90% dei casi che ho conosciuto: lei troi... e lui idiota e porco.  Però non si può fare di tutta l'erba un fascio. Nella vita tutto è possibile. Se ti innamori di una persona te ne innamori e talvolta, in certe situazioni il pregiudizio diviene scorretto e pesante da sopportare.<br>  Spero che nel tuo caso sia amore vero. Perchè no?|`|0ZtVYx9aaa	magari all inizio..ma poi c è troppa differenza di obbiettivi...|`|S8dSUmHwaa	Perché non dovrebbe esistere?<br>  All'amore tutto è possibile.|`|muSLRtuqaa	x soldi!!!|`|r9YeGA7oaa	Se è vero amore si..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  L'amore vero esiste ovunque..<br>  Se è vero amore esiste anche nel nulla più profondo..<br>  Senza pensieri, convinzioni e ragionamenti umani..<br>  L'amore vero riesce anche dove niente è possibile..|`|uAYbFL9Eaa	esiste, esiste, eccome se esiste......|`|xbmxVmxzaa	SI!   !!!esiste, la mia storia è la conferma!!!!.<br>  Tra me e la mia compagna(moglie) ci sono più di 20 anni.<br>  Pensa che mi chiama il mio GIOVANE-MATURO.<br>  Bisogna avere tanta fiducia, ottimismo ed AMORE.<br>  Credere in quel che si fa, FREGARSENE DI TUTTI, tanto tutti hanno da dire la loro, costruire il progetto ( progetto di coppia) fatto con lei.<br>  <br>  Non è facile, proprio per questo è più bello!!!|`|P9kljcfOaa	e perché no.sai come si dice l' amore non ha eta,oppure l' amore rende ciechi,etc.nella vita mai dire mai.|`|PuZAk3Xgaa	può esis5tere un sentimento d'amore, ma nel tempo poi...uno fa l'infermiere dell'altro...-|`|frWtnz5Saa	chi lo può dire?e' questione anche di fortuna e' un fatto personale ad esempio io non potrei mi vivere con uno Più anziano di me'....al di la' di questo anche con un coetaneo con l' andar del tempo la passione purtroppo svanisce per lasciare spazio ad altri sentimenti,C'è chi questo lo accetta..oppure bisogna sempre essere in gioco....|`|gpqZgM3Jaa	sì xkè no...anche se sembra un pò ridicolo...|`|kJtvEAZvaa	Dipende..fra 16 e 46 la vedo un po' dura!|`|sSN2hFmOaa	Sì può esistere Amore!!!!!!!!!!!poi dipende.......se hanno 20/40 ci sono tantissimi nuomini che a 40 sono affascinanti e sexi non trovi??
xbmxVmxzaa	L'amore, il desiderio, la gelosia portano a un disperato senso di solitudine della quale io mi appago come in un confortante rifugio, ciò rende impenetrabile l'accesso a chi vorrebbe inoltrarsi nell'intimità delle mie emozioni.<br>  Per anni ho amato la solitudine, ho imparato a conviverci.<br>  Non ci si può appropiare impunemente di una persona con la presunzione di sottrarla a tutti gli altri, forse questo è il vero senso dell'amore e dell'amicizia, lontano dalle passionalità che inducono al possesso quanto mai facile preda di chi mostra modi gentili e confortanti.<br>  Non parlo più di ciò che mi affligge, lo sopporto in silenzio. La cosa saggia è tacere anche quando qualcuno ti offre la disponobilità, morbosa e compasionevole, a confidare i tuoi intimi sentimenti.<br>  <br>  <br>  La solitudine ha comunque un vantaggio che dopo averla conosciuta in tutte le sue forme mi è venuta a noia!!!|`|u6gPD30qaa	siamo in 2:(:(:(|`|33s47xadaa	è normale che tu ti senta così..la solitudine è al mondo di oggi un mal comune..e come si dice, mal comune mezzo gaudio!no davvero..ti capisco benissimo perchè anche a me spesso prendono questi periodi di tristezza..e mi sento tanto sola..ma vedrai, tutto passa!dopo la tempesta, c'è sempre il sole. l'unico consiglio che ti dò è quello di non stare chiuso in casa..esci, vai a passeggiare, frequenta persone e locali!non ti chiudere in casa..altrimenti non passa più. un bacio e buona fortuna|`|5XNqLQaRaa	allora mi unisco a tè sono pure io così|`|7zgP3E7Aaa	SE CONTINUI A SCRIVERE QUI SOPRA RESTERAI SEMPRE SOLO ESCI CONM GLI AMICI VAI DA QLK PARTE E CONOSCI GENTE REALMENTE E NN VIRTUALMENTE!!!!!!!

1c68b8d1942264d97d4093b2213efff7aa	18 settembre 2007: data indimenticabile! è stato meraviglioso, cioè, è stato un po' imbarazzante, era la prima volta per entrambi (io 15 lui quasi 16) perciò eravamo un po' impacciati, ma alla fine è stato fantastico! uscivamo insieme da tempo, e un giorno, dopo scuola, eravamo in un parco, stesi su un prato, tutti un po' aggrovigliati, come sempre, a parlare di tutto, o a stare in silenzio, e lui a un certo punto mi ha guardata negli occhi, e ho capito, e non ho avuto il tempo di pensare perché l'istante dopo le sue labbra sulle mie mi stavano dando i brividi..! poi io dovevo andare a casa, mi ha baciata ancora mentre salivo sull'autobus, e tutto il viaggio fino a casa -un'ora buona- è passato in un secondo, sempre lo stesso, su quel meraviglioso prato che ha continuato a vederci fino a novembre. ero felice, euforica, ma mi tenevo tutto per me, e a casa non avevo voglia di mangiare e parlare con nessuno, mi bastava quel ricordo per vivere. le volte dopo è andata ovviamente molto meglio, ma la prima non si scorda mai, e sarà per me sempre un ricordo dolce, meraviglioso, perché è stato il primo bacio della mia vita, dato dal mio primo ragazzo, che al momento sembra essere la persona con cui potrei passare il resto dei miei giorni senza annoiarmi mai!|`|5M6zhSCMaa	...viscido, che schifo, non ero molto convinta|`|rtB5BdFxaa	oddio, ho la pelle d'oca al solo pensiero!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  troppo bello anche perchè ero cotta di quel ragazzo e quindi le sensazioni si sono moltiplicate all'infinito!!!!!!!!!!|`|2ypgCPTNaa	Un disastro... lei era più grande di me...<br>  adesso non ricordo quanti anni aveva...però tipo 3 o 4 più di me...che all'età dei 13/14 anni sono tantissimi...<br>  lei quindi già navigata io sfigatissimo e ovviamente lei pensava che io fossi già esperto...(cazzata)...<br>  mi ricordo lei che chiude gli occhi e si avvicina a me...io preso dal panico...(occhi rigorosamente sbarrati) faccio lo stesso...e ci baciamo...<br>  <br>  a questo punto nasce un dubbio...c.a.z.z.o a me nessuno aveva detto che ci dovevo mettere la lingua...quindi rimango li come un pirla...e dopo un pò me ne vado...<br>  <br>  premesso che sta tizia non mi piaceva poi molto, però era più grande e quindi ero un figo agli occhi di tutti....potevo deluderli?direi di no...però ho deluso lei....<br>  <br>  il giorno dopo l'ho lasciata, tra i pianti generali...perchè mi prendeva male...però è stato un momento bello...pienissimo di imbarazzo...e non lo dimenticherò mai...ciao!|`|LVxohQ4Baa	indipendentemente dall'imbarazzo e dall' "imbranataggine" rimarrà sempre e comunque un ricordo bellissimo!!! :-)|`|XMdOVdeqaa	beh ci ero rimasto male xk non me lo aspettavo(xk era una mia amica)..però è stato mlt bello..|`|0tcmP8hAaa	ehm... aspetto ancora... voglio una storia seria...|`|2bxk4x9Gaa	al inizio un po strano poi meravilioso|`|UD5cN2Yzaa	ricordo dissi  "che schifo........."<br>  ma io so' matta lasciate perde e prima peggio de mo'!!!!!|`|lZDNJ3GIaa	non è stato un granchè il primo. il tipo mi piaceva xò ero abbastanza imbarazzata e tesa e quindi nn mi è piaciuto molto..ero pure più piccina. xò cmq direi ke poi il secondo è stato il migliore...  e anche quelli ke hanno seguito, ma nn con lo stesso raga più...|`|nBQ7alQnaa	niente di speciale...|`|nJRqhbKjaa	stupendo..28 luglio..pomeriggio d'estate..sotto un albero sdraiati sull'erba...prima mi bacia la fronte..poi le labbra e poi un vero e bel bacio =D|`|sQmWlqBfaa	a pensarci mi vengono i brividi..<br>  il primo è sempre il primo..|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Per gioco e curiosita.<br>  Si faceva il gioco della bottiglia, un gruppo misto di amici/che<br>  si faceva girare la bottiglia ed a chi veniva il colo della stessa, decideva chi baciare ( in bocca con la lingua).<br>  Eravamo 14/15enni e curiosi di scoprire il SESSO!!!!<br>  Fu il mio primo bacio, che ricorderò sempre, era una ragazza della stessa età ma con qualche ''POMICIATA'' di esperienza!!!!|`|0Nf65bB5aa	la prima volta che volevo chiedere alla mia ragazza di baciarla sono stato seduto vicino a lei 2 ore senza dire una parola poi tutto e andato bene|`|1gwTEYEraa	Era il 30 aprile...E nel mio paese c'erano le giostre...Quel ragazzo mi piaceva da 2 lunghi anni...Siamo andati a farci un giretto e poi mi ha baciata...Giuro ke nn riuscivo a smettere di sorridere!!<br>  Poi ora ke ci penso mi viene da ridere...Il posto nn era x nulla romantico...Una vietta dove pisciavano i vekki e dove i ragazzi si facevano le burbe...Bello!!<br>  Però essendo cotta di lui nn pensavo al posto...<br>  Ora io e lui siamo tanto amici e a volte ci mettiamo a parlare di quella sera e ci scassiamo!!<br>  Mik tvttttb!!!|`|1xU9Wxj0aa	brtxmxmxm...ma mi sn rifatta subito al secondo !!!,,,=P|`|5ffae04e24fa1f51d57fa76f0aac0cf8aa	come disse BENISSIMO Dustin Hoffman in Rain man: "umido".<br>  Giuro!

ffb5ae6af63017c1d04b0eceac0d6807aa	che dire una persona infame! Le sei stato sempre vicino e lei ti ripaga a zampate. Bè è brutto da dire, ma ti servirà per il futuro. Anzi ti dirò preparati che la tizia tra poco avrà una crisi e ti verrà pure a cercare e TU, forte del passato, la ignorerai...spero.

Chi da per amore lo fa senza aspettarsi nulla in cambio anche se  in questo caso lei ha solo preso. Al momento di ricambiare ha pensato bene di prendere amore e gioia da un altro...<br>  Se ti ha usato, certamente però tu glielo hai permesso. Non conosco bene la tua storia se non dalle poche righe che scrivi e questo è quello che penso...<br>  <br>  <br>  Ok, ti capisco....hai dato tutto e temi che il comportamento con la prossima persona che verrà sarà condizionato dalla situazione passata...secondo me è giusto imparare dalle esperienze precedenti e trarne insegnamento ma ricordati che ogni persona è diversa ed è giusto porsi  in maniera libera e incondizionata alla prossima donna che ti troverai davanti. Immagino che non sarà semplice, ma sembri una persona intelligente e sensibile e sono sicura ci riuscirai. Baci e buona fortuna|`|ergSRfIRaa	0_0|`|pujtBIXhaa	mi sembra naturale che tu rimuggini tanto, ma non dovresti farlo più, da quello che scrivi mi è chiaro che la vostra storia non ha comunque futuro quindi, scusami, che senso ha perdere le tue energie in qualcosa che non vale?? pensaci, meglio secondo me faresti canalizzare le tue energie su te stesso, amarti di più e poi col tempo vedrai che le ferite guariscono, ma non devi pensarci, fa di tutto per non pensare. può sembrarti crudele mio consiglio ma vedrai che è per il tuo bene, poi non dimenticare che ogni cosa fatta è fatta e questo non cambia e che il tempo passato è andato via e non puoi fare nulla, allora cosa vedi di costruttivo nel pensarci? guarda oltre ,esci verso la luce e non perderti più in dettagli che ora non servono più! auguroni!!|`|xbmxVmxzaa	Bella storia........................!!!!!!!!!!...<br>  Cosa si può intuire.............................<br>  uomini pronti a dare, donne pronte a ricevere..................per comodità, per egoismo!!!!!<br>  Ma quando ritornerà, perchè sicuro che ritornerà, altrimenti ha trovato un ''pollo'' che la manterrà ( forse meglio di te??), dovrai essere talmente forte............................ dovrai capire se è stato un errore nel percorso o....................passi lunghi e ben distesi dalla tua vita!!!!! Cmq capisco come ti senti: fortemente VUOTO!!!!<br>  <br>  PS: ed USATO ??????|`|w0GpO51Uaa	Non le faccio una colpa secondo me una ragazza del genere scusa se te lo dico ma e' proprio malata...perche' una persona giudiziosa non farebbe mai una cosa del genere ti ha usato...e scommetto che tornera' quando avra' bisogno di nuovo ma li devi essere forte e lasciarla perdere!

FloDyUwfaa	Non minimizzare la cosa.<br>  Il cattolicesimo che c'e' in Italia e' una religione abbastanza all'acqua di rose. La comunita' (amici, famiglia!) ti accetta anche se non segui alla lettera la parola del Papa.<br>  <br>  Altre comunita' religiose non sono cosi'. Persone possono essere rinnegate da tutta la loro comunita' (compresa la famiglia stretta) per aver trasgredito ad un qualche precetto.<br>  <br>  Ci sono cose purtroppo che vanno al di la' della singola persona. Idee che molte persone danno per scontate non lo sono affatto in certe comunita'. E le persone che hai vicino ti condizionano.<br>  <br>  Le storie "contro tutto e tutti" non finiscono quasi mai bene. Banale, ma basta ricordare R&G.<br>  <br>  Cerca di conoscerlo meglio. Se non ci riesci, puo' non essere del tutto casuale. Spero di sbagliarmi.|`|0o94r3TSaa	Penso che l'uomo non contento delle diversità razziali si sia inventato le religioni per avere nuove differenze e complicare i rapporti interpersonali. Sinceramente trovo ridicolo lasciarsi influenzare a tal punto da una religione da creare pregiudizi, un'amicizia è un legame sentimentale che dovrebbe andare oltre a queste cose, se così non è non è un'amicizia e men che meno si può trasformare in qualcosa di più.<br>  è combattuto? Se lo è non ti merita.|`|T3LRQZ5Oaa	Le religioni diverse non devono essere ostacolo, tutte le religioni parlano d'amore e se la mente umana la smette di creare dei dogmi il percorso diviene bellissimo.<br>  Il fatto che lui possa essere combattuto dimostra due cose, che  tu gli interessi particolarmente e che non è un fanatico religioso.<br>  Riguardo al fumare sigarette o al divorzio, sono cose che anche la tua religione non vede bene, questo ci dovrebbe far capire che la religione può dare degli spunti ma che ogni individuo deve agire secondo il proprio cuore  e il buon senso.|`|i8YFOe81aa	Mi verrebbe da dire "l'amore supera ogni barriera...." !!! Io sono romantica ed idealista e penso che se il sentimento è forte può davvero superare certe differenze, purchè da entrambe le parti ci sia rispetto verso le convinzioni e credenze dell'altro senza voler imporre le proprie.<br>  Il problema, a mio avviso, sta proprio qui: da quello che so dei TdG, non sono molto propensi ad accettare nella propria cerchia chi non è dei loro, mi spiego meglio, probabilmente la sua famiglia vi metterebbe i bastoni tra le ruote. O sentito storie di chi voleva uscire dalla congregazione e che è stato ripudiato dalla propria famiglia... Comunque non rinunciare in fretta, prenditi il tuo tempo per valutare, come si dice, "se son rose fioriranno"! Auguri!|`|wNxSWXFMaa	Ma da quando la religione ti aiuta a superare i problemi?<br>  ti dicono solo la solita risposta: "E' per volere di Dio..." ma ne siamo sicuri? perchè si parla per conto di terzi? mah...i misteri della vita.

Tu lo sai, ma lui fa un pò il furbetto!<br>  Ci starai male all'inizio, ma la strada migliore da intraprendere è proprio quella di non farti più sentire, di uscire dalla sua vita.

DISGUSTING! he looks like a rat!!!! uggghhh!|`|dD27E0auaa	No offense to the guy in black, but I don't think he's that attractive.

No comment.|`|uiMKfrNJaa	I don't like either one.|`|IubfHhnMaa	nice i like them  8 all round!|`|f01fyyEfaa	You are all just kids.  Looks should not matter at your age as you will all look different as you mature.  Some will look better and some will not.  You will then go through a phase where looks may matter a lot to you and your friends, and you may put too much emphasis on looks and that may be what attracts you.  Hopefully, as you become an adult you will mature and learn that relationships based on looks are often shallow, and it will be a person's character and personality that will attract you and be meaningful.  For now, just have fun with your friends and not worry so much about looks.|`|Sbz3hg1Xaa	lol omg those are both so ugly and look like total douchbags! No offense but the 1 in the blk shirt looks like a hungry child prostitute from brazil and the 1 in the pink just looks like a really gay *** dude.

43ec9c9eb973ff6a4b7b6cfd14981b82aa	You got jealous cause it smashed your ego..it wasn't because you still like her, it's cause you don't like the idea of someone being 'better' than you.  Which in this case her likin some other guy would be the case.  Yea you got feelings cause you MIGHT have had somethin, but if you don't like her like that, then either stop being around her or talkin to her, or get over your ego.  If she moves on you can't get mad cause you don't LIKE her anymore..and she apparently has moved on as well so it's best to leave sleeping dogs lie know what i mean?|`|84ba2cd69c5b17cc2f05a3fe00e67ea9aa	...find someone else...|`|OK0MbNdVaa	well that happens to the best of us.. like last week  i kissed my ex- boyfriend although i dont have any feelings for him because i convinced myself not to like him.. <br>  <br>  i dont think you should feel guilty but i think that you should apologize and let her know how u feel.. and u cannot like and not like her at the same time. u need to decide how u feel about her... its not fair for her to get a kiss from u if u dnt like her..its allowing her to get her hopes up..<br>  <br>  hope i helped. good luck!|`|HtDEFGpVaa	i have the exact same problem with my ex girlfriends, easiest way is just to move on, and try your best to ignore them, make sure she knows how you feel, and try to be nice so she doesnt get hurt. then just avoid contact with her. you will find someone else you like more and forget about her mate, i can guarentee it.|`|tm4mmm2Waa	kiddy drama. (wannabe-drama)|`|uUHIBX3laa	move on.. forget about her..<br>  u jus need somone new|`|f4XyH1jvaa	I think you still do like her, and you want her to continue to like you. You say she has an infatuation with you. You don't want that to end. The attention is nice to have.<br>  <br>  Move on. Find someone that else to get your mind off of her. That's the best medicine for a situation like this.|`|Z1aB7JFHaa	maybe you just need a break. maybe it's like when, you play a videogame, day in and dayout, and you just stop playing it for a long time and start playing again and restart the cycle|`|AyaVkfkxaa	crank some three days grace. theyll have somethin on their album you can relate to somehow|`|6cDvEk0Taa	it sounds like you dont like her anymore, but you dont want anyone else to have her.|`|EO9ULApIaa	see u may not b liking her but u still care for her and u dont want anyone to come  near her|`|UEg9Qtgpaa	move on with your life.|`|AA10102217	sorry i don't have an answer, but i know how you feel
d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	It could be that she has gotten used to the things you do most likely. Change things around and do things that make her say "Ouuuuuch!" for a change.<br>  <br>  LOL Well, the things is you have to keep a girl on her toes. You always do the samething and they get bored. So be varied.<br>  <br>  Also, she may have outgrown her "awwww". Could you imagine a person doing that the rest of their lives? It would be horrible. So don't give up, maybe she is changing a bit. We all change over time.<br>  <br>  Lastly, maybe she doesnt think much of the relationship anymore. <br>  <br>  In any case, give her the benefit of the doubt. "Awwww" should not be how you define your relationship. There are plenty more things than that.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|kIE9TxvWaa	Maybe you're over-doing it.  Try to lay back some because chicks get annoyed with guys who over-compliment them.  You didn't fail, just relax and do it less.  <br>  <br>  Every now and then, throw her a curve.  Tell her she smells bad, but smile when you do it so that she gets the hint that ur teasing her.|`|712be3cc28c84f01cc247e87936f48c5aa	Suspend saying sweet things for a while, she will come on Y/A wondering, we will tell her to get back to saying awwwwww|`|tm4mmm2Waa	Probably gets old.....<br>  <br>  "Too much candy is never good for you."|`|fLoGcjwTaa	Yeah, that happens when the two of you have been going out for a while. It means that she feels like she doesn't have to go out of her way to woo & impress you as much as she used to. Now she's probably only saying it when she really means it, which is IMHO better than someone saying nice things just to make you interested. As long as she's still saying these things & isn't giving you real reasons to worry, I'd let it go. I'm sure that there are things that you've stopped doing for her as well, even if you don't realize it.|`|4FshoiQcaa	I think she caught on to you trying to impress her and maybe felt that you werent being sincere. My husband would do that to me and I ended up just turning the other way and rolling my eyes. Just chill. Only say things that you mean. Why are you just saying things just to make her "think" shes special. Instead, SHOW her. Little love notes or a rose on her car. ACTIONS SPEAK LOUDER THAN WORDS!|`|24a761dbd02845affe79db086d2dfe7caa	i used to say that to my bf<br>   to but  i dont say it much anymore<br>  REALAX<br>  you dident do anything wrong maybee she just doesent feel like saying or getting tired of it|`|lQsP47U8aa	maybe you need to change gears once in a while...like give her flowers  or write a sweet poem there so many way to express your love.|`|L4sp6QHsaa	um she has gotten use to you saying the stuff and you might be saying the same thing over and over|`|c5b91af8f2f5d06ad48ebd329c25945faa	Maybe  you  need  to  stop  being  subtle...  and  say  things  to  make  her  feel  more  feminine.  Girly.  Let  her  know  that  she  brings  out  the  man  in  you.  Makes  you  come  alive  when  you're  with  her!  "Me  Tarzan...  you  Jane."  Be  playful  with  her  and  have  fun  making  her  laugh.  I  don't  think  her  feelings  for  you  have  changed  that  much,  maybe  she  just  feels  more  comfortable  with  you  now  that  she's  better  acquainted  with  you.  If  the  above  doesn't  help  that  much,  then  you  'n  her  may  not  be  that  well  matched  with  each  other.  Stop  at  the  bookstore  and  get  a  "Trivia"  booklet  of  questions  'n  answers.  It  will  inspire  you  with  questions  to  ask  her,  like  "What's  your  favorite   food?  Your  favorite  color?  Your  favorite  time  of  the  day?"  I  bet  you  don't  know  the  answers  to  those  questions.  It  may  open  your  eyes  to    how  well  you  really  know  someone.   Or  don't  know  them.|`|jnXenqcMaa	What you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent question were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you no points, and may God have mercy on your soul.

Poi se magari non riesci a stare in casa potresti riempire una bottiglietta di the con del whiskey ed iniziare a camminare, magari stasera e vedrai che dopo qualche mezz'oretta potrebbero anche schiarirtisi i pensieri. Quando sono giu' di morale riesco nel disegno a fissare in un percorso catartico cio' che soffrigge nella mente... Le penne i pennelli i colori e le loro sfumature, tutti insieme uniti ad aiutare a lenire gli attimi nevrotici.
