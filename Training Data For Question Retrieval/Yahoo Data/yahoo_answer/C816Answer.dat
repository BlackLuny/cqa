Not to break the bank, I recommend the followng brands, just to get you started:  Arturo Fuente, CAO, Uppmann - just a couple.|`|y5CGdNpTaa	if you want to buy from a family who has been in the business for four generations go to <a href="http://www.cigarfox.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cigarfox.com</a>  They have great quality products...low overhead because they aren'y one of the big three e-tailers out there. they are the up am coming. watch out big boys|`|AuvMZYTSaa	Do NOT order from Thompson's!

The first one dripped burger grease all down the back everytime we grilled those on it.  And this second one is a pain to clean since the 'non-stick' plates aren't quite so...<br>  <br>  Well you can cook pretty much anything on it you could grill outdoors.  We do burgers, chicken, veggies, even breakfast sausage.  I like it because the grease drains out, but it does tend to dry/burn foods quickly.  I spritz the food with some stock or even water soemtimes.  You also have to use thinner cuts of meats or else you'll have burnt outsides and pink insides.  Sometimes I leave the lid up and let food cook more like a normal grill.<br>  <br>  My MIL has a newer one with a temperature setting and removeable plates that go in the dishwasher.  If you like this one I would recommend upgrading to one like that.|`|YryC6dxUaa	You can pretty much cook anything that isn't too small on the grill as you would in a frying pan. Chicken and turkey fillets are excellent on the grill, depending on thickness is takes about 8-10 minutes to cook a half breast or one fillet of turkey.

Last night when I was looking in my fridge for things to make dinner I saw I had some awesome looking broccoli and some slightly past it's prime spinach. My hubby wanted pasta so I thought  I'd make a soup. Half way through I switched tactics and came up with this awesome and actually quite healthy mac and cheese. Hope you like it.<br>  P.S. I've posted the link to another recipe for a traditional mac and cheese recipe which is the one I always use. <br>  Sweet Loreto's Green Mac and Cheese<br>  <br>  1 medium onion, chopped<br>  2 ribs celery, chopped<br>  1 large or 2 small cloves of garlic chopped<br>  1 large head of broccoli, florets cut into bight size pieces, stems roughly chopped, <br>  2 cups spinach<br>  2 tablespoons cream (sour or heavy), optional<br>  1 cup Monterrey jack cheese or any other cheese that melts, optional (I used Mexican Manchego cheese which is made from cow's milk instead of the traditional sheep's milk)<br>  2 tablespoons finely grated parmesan cheese, optional<br>  1 tablespoon olive oil<br>  1 tablespoon butter<br>  1and 1/2 cup chicken or vegetable broth. Can also use water.<br>  salt, pepper, and an all purpose seasoning like Mrs. Dash to taste<br>  <br>  1- Place a large pot full of salted water on to boil. Cook macaroni or other small pasta until al dente. Drain and set aside.<br>  2- In a large pot over medium flame, heat oil. When oil starts to smoke add butter and onions. Saute until butter has melted and onion is translucent (about 3 - 5 minutes). Add celery and saute for 2 more minutes. Add garlic and broccoli STEMS ONLY. Saute for an additional 2 or 3 minutes.<br>  3- Add the chicken broth and cover. Cook broccoli stems until just tender. Add the spinach and stir until wilted. Using an immersion blender puree this mixture (you can also use a regular stand up blander) to desired consistency, I left small chunks in mine. Season with salt, pepper, and seasonings.<br>  4- Add cream and  monterrey cheese if adding. Add broccoli florets and heat through until cheese has melted and the florets are tender.Add cooked pasta and toss. Serve and top with parmesan cheese.<br>  Enjoy.|`|RkTxwp40aa	Though I've never made it myself , I've seen it done. First boil the elbow macaroni, don't over cook. Then grade some real cheese of your choice.Don't hold back you need a lot. Strain the noodles. In a glass baking dish add the pasta and cheese in layers with the last layer being the cheese.Next bake @ 350 for 30 min. or until the cheese is a little crisp on the edge. I've also tried it with bacon or ground beef,not the healthiest but it is comfort food.

Ice cream has dairy in it and that is not good for a sore throat.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	Chicken noodle soup but you should also try hot tea with lemon and honey.|`|VcTp893Baa	the soup..<br>  <br>  but lemon and hot water mixed together is magic for your throat|`|nXUYgsm2aa	chicken noodle soup!!!! it makes your throat feel way better than if you were to eat ice cream!|`|HMhUKAgkaa	Chicken noodle soup has a lot of salt in it. Salt extracts water from the cells in your throat helping to ease the swelling and will help ease the pain as well.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Supposedly the chicken soup will actually help you get well faster.  You shouldn't have dairy if you're congested, because dairy will make more mucous.  So, if you want something cold and soothing, eat sorbet (no dairy) or popsicles

Also, don't try and fry anything in olive oil or anything delicate like that - olive oil has a very low smoke point and burns easily, and really shouldn't be used for anything than very very gentle frying and cold dishes like salads. Try groundnut oil Hxx|`|w83LU7xLaa	i think you are supposed to rinse the pans out before you use them and make sure that you put oil or something in the pan before you cook anything because otherwise the food will stick and burn even if it is on their for a few seconds<br>  <br>  also check that you didn't leave any packaging on the bottom of the or anything<br>  -sounds really stupid but i did it once and set the pan on fire|`|sUeZ5duGaa	Of course. I would recommend scrubbing the pans a few times before you cook to break them in. Also you might want to turn the temperature down. Good luck!

Every side has to be cooked for around 1-2 minutes. It should form a nice crust for you.<br>  <br>  Then, just put it in the oven to finish it off. You can find a recipe for whichever cut of meat you have. <br>  <br>  Don't overcook the meat, and PLEASE let the meat rest 10 minutes after you take it out of the oven. If you cut into it while it's too hot, then all the juices will come out of the meat and onto the plate... making your steak dry.<br>  <br>  <br>  Prime Rib takes too long.
Gabo2Uc7aa	It is a cured meat and it should last longer than other un-cured meats, but I'm with the others in that you shouldn't keep any meat longer than 3 to 4 days.  Although, I do know people who buy sliced ham and keep it for over a week and don't have any problems.  I'm a better safe than sorry person, so I'd say stick it in the freezer and take it out and put it in the fridge the day before you plan on using it.|`|VsMtCrk7aa	Freeze it til you use it.

Pure refers to the fact that no non-olive oils are mixed in.|`|oX1209WOaa	Extra Virgin oil tastes stronger with olive taste.  Some oils are better than other by brands.  Check how old it is.  More than anything is how fast the oil sells on shelves.  More popular brands move faster and therefore have a fresher taste.  Smell it and if it smells bad, it will not taste right.  Smell and taste are related. If you still are not sure, dip a lettuce leaf in a tiny bit to try it.|`|efMLAf9Eaa	Extra virgin olive oil is simply the higher grade of olive oil, it has a much richer stronger taste to olive oil. You could compare it to the full fat milk of the oil world. It is the first press from the olives and is usually more expensive due to this fact.|`|geih5vR8aa	It'll be fine, it will just have a slightly "lighter" flavor. <br>  <br>  EVOO is the first press of the olive, so it will have a richer, darker and more flavorful oil.

5IWYjVT6aa	i went to a website and it said the 3 categories are Dry Heat, Moist Heat, and Microwaving.<br>   For Dry Heat:<br>  Methods such as broiling and roasting which surround the meat with hot dry air are considered to be dry heat cooking methods. Dry heat is suitable for cooking <br>  all seafood <br>  all young poultry cuts <br>  all cuts of pork except thin shoulder cuts and hocks <br>  all cuts of lamb except breast and shank cuts <br>  all veal roasts <br>  all beef steaks from youthful animals <br>  rib roasts <br>  short loins <br>  sirloins <br>  selected areas of rounds <br>  all comminuted meats. <br>  <br>  Broiling should only be used for more tender chops and steaks since no additional tenderization will result. High surface temperatures result in extensive browning which give the meat a unique flavor. <br>  <br>  Charcoal broiling is a popular method suitable for cooking chops, steaks, chicken, ribs, kabobs, sausage, and sometimes roasts. Temperatures used in this method of cooking are usually lower than oven broiling. Charcoal broiling imparts a unique smoked flavor to food due to the combustion of charcoal and melted fat drippings. Evidence suggest that this type of cooking may increase the risk of some types of cancer so be sure to follow a few simple guidelines to minimize your risk. <br>  <br>  Roasting is appropriate for tender roasts. Oven temperatures are usually kept between 300 and 350 degrees Fahrenheit. Meat should be protected during roasting by an external layer of fat or by aluminum foil to prevent excessive moisture loss which results in a dry finished product. Large cuts such as intact rounds, hams, and turkeys, may be cooked at reduced temperatures (250 degrees Fahrenheit) for extended periods of time. <br>  <br>  Moist Heat<br>  For cuts of meat which are lower grade or tend to be tougher due to the cut, moist heat is the preferred method of cooking. Cooking by this method requires lower temperatures (just above 200 degrees Fahrenheit) and much longer cooking times. Braising and pot roasting are both moist heat cooking methods where meat is cooked in closed containers with added water. Seasoning, sauces, and flour may be added during cooking to enhance the flavor or texture of the final product. Moist heat cooking methods are recommended for: <br>  some seafood <br>  stewing poultry <br>  pork thin shoulder cuts and hocks <br>  lamb breast and shank cuts <br>  veal chops, cutlets, steaks, shoulder and round roasts, shank and breast cuts <br>  beef chuck, round, fore shank, brisket, short plate, flank and tip cuts <br>  <br>  <br>  Microwaving<br>  Microwaving is an extremely rapid method of cooking meat. The use of lower power (30% power) is recommended for more uniform cooking especially for larger meat cuts. Microwave cooking is not recommended for cuts which are less tender as microwave cooking does not tenderize meats as slower cooking methods do. Meats which are suitable for microwave cooking include: <br>  processed meats such as hotdogs, bacon, and meat loaves <br>  precooked items <br>  some boneless fresh meat cuts|`|AA12198711	A little homework help here?|`|SlQD7cpnaa	flaming <br>  boiling <br>  sesoning <br>  roasting <br>  <br>  are all ways to cook and they all end up tasting good!!!! <br>  <br>  cj|`|FPsR2xi7aa	There are too many to list (Several hundred at least).  If you were to give an idea of what you were looking for specifically, things would be easier.<br>  <br>  Also, it would be nice for you to define what you consider a "cooking method category" to be.  I.E. how would you like them categorized... by instrument used, by ethnic background of the method, by style of food produced... etc.

GCBv0zkoaa	Caldo de Camarón (Shrimp Soup)<br>  Caldo de Camarón is an authentic Mexican soup popular along the Gulf coast. Use dried shrimp to make this, which is available in many supermarkets or online through our affiliate, Mex Grocer.<br>  <br>      * 3-1/2 ounces dried shrimp<br>      * 2 carrots, diced in half-inch pieces<br>      * 5 medium new potatoes, peeled and diced in half-inch pieces<br>      * 2 bay leaves or laurel leaves<br>      * 1 serrano chile, chopped<br>      * chopped fresh cilantro<br>      * paprika, as desired<br>      * lemon wedges<br>  <br>  Clean and rinse the dried shrimp under running water. In a soup pot or dutch oven, bring 7 cups of water to a boil. Add the dried shrimp, carrots and potatoes, and cook for 10 minutes. Reduce heat and add the bay leaves and serrano chile; simmer for an additional 10 minutes.<br>  <br>  Remove the bay leaves, ladle into soup bowls and sprinkle with cilantro and paprika. Garnish with lemon wedges.|`|0j6v4KKMaa	1/2 kilo dry shrimp <br>  2 or 3 grilled and peeled tomatoes <br>  1/4 onion <br>  1 garlic <br>  *1 or 2 dry chile chipotle grilled <br>  Epazote <br>  1 chopped carrot <br>  oil<br>  <br>  There are so many ideas about to leave the head of the shrimp or not when you prepare a caldo, that in this case I leave this to you. Some people leave the heads but remove the eyes, because they say they make your caldo bitter. I personally, remove the heads, as I was taught. Put them into a pan, with low heat and just toast them a little. It is so easy to burn them, so be careful. Put half of the amount aside and the other one goes to the blend, with the tomatoes, onion, garlic, and chipotle. Blend well. <br>  <br>  In your pot with the oil already warm, fry the mix and add water enough to have the consistency of a soup. Add the carrot, the other half of the camaron and epazote. It is better to use a sprig of epazote with leaves, so it is easier to remove it when ready. <br>  <br>  Cook your caldo with medium-low heat, caldo is always better when cooks slow. It will be finished when the carrots are cooked. <br>  <br>  Serve it with slices of lemon, and tortilla chips or tostadas. You may have handy some other sauces like Bufalo or Tabasco, if someone likes to have the caldo hotter. <br>  <br>  * Chile chipotle can be replaced by chile de arbol or chile cascabel, or chile guajillo, the last one is the mildest.

Hardly anybody makes them at home so pretty much the only time you eat them is a special occasion.  <br>  <br>  They say there's nothing intrinsically good or bad about any flavor -- it's all a social construct.

Doing as you suggest, you are making it more likely to get an injury since your not allowing yourself much recovery time, so wouldn't suggest it.<br>  <br>  With any exercise your going to firm up, build muscle.  My guess would be that you will bulk up, as to how much would depend upon just how heavy you are going and how many reps.  Genetics comes into play as well, so really hard to give a one size fits all answer since it is going to depend on the individual.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	It depends on how much protein you eat.  If you don't eat any, you will have no muscle tone.  If you eat lots of protein, and do high weight/few reps, you will have prominent muscles.|`|NEw5dsJlaa	Check out Mac Danzig, winner of the Ultimate Fighter. He is vegan and his body is sickkkkk.

It's just easier to eat some chicken or beef... then have to make boring protein shakes all the time.<br>  <br>  For my body type... well, I'm 6'0" 195 lbs. I keep trying to get back in the gym. Before, I weighed 220 lbs, and looked like a linebacker, when I was in college (and worked out 3 hours a day, 4-5 times a week... I could bench press 300 lbs.)<br>  <br>  If I were to eat veggies and workout consistently, I'd probably drop to 170 lbs. I would be cut up, and lean, but I'd have to buy new jeans again... and that's expensive.. lol.<br>  <br>  Now I can bench, MAYBE 200... and that's a maybe, cuz I don't lift to gain strength or muscle anymore.

Geez!!!!<br>  <br>  As to the question, I would have to say margarine for health because it has less saturated fat and no cholesterol.  Different formulas are going to vary in other nutrition -but since it is 100% - what kind of fat it is important.  For taste, I would always go with butter - but for health, a trans fat free margarine such as Smart Beat will do well.<br>  <br>  As for the "one molecule away from plastic..." claim?  Also hogwash - check out the following: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.plucodes.com/faqs.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.plucodes.com/faqs.aspx</a><br>  <a href="http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/butter.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/butt...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/2004-01/1074274923.Ch.r.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/200...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/620923/is_margarine_one_molecule_away_from.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070512232929AAwbuBu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/294710" rel="nofollow">http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/294710</a><br>  <br>  All of those refute the myth that margarine is close to plastic.|`|287ff78445969e6728827bb2210c9074aa	Answer:<br>  Margarine usually tops butter when it comes to heart health. <br>  <br>  Margarine is made from vegetable oils, so it contains no cholesterol. Margarine is also higher in "good" fats — polyunsaturated and monounsaturated — than butter is. These types of fat help reduce low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or "bad," cholesterol, when substituted for saturated fat. Butter, on the other hand, is made from animal fat, so it contains cholesterol and high levels of saturated fat. <br>  <br>  But not all margarines are created equal — and some may even be worse than butter. Most margarines are processed using a method called hydrogenation, which results in unhealthy trans fats. In general, the more solid the margarine, the more trans fats it contains — so stick margarines usually have more trans fats than do tub margarines. Like saturated fats, trans fats increase blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease. In addition, trans fats can lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL), or "good," cholesterol levels. <br>  <br>  When selecting a margarine, choose one with the lowest trans fat content possible and less than 2 grams total of saturated plus trans fats. Manufacturers are required to list saturated and trans fats separately on food labels. Also, margarines fortified with plant sterols can help reduce LDL cholesterol levels by more than 10 percent. The amount of daily plant sterols needed for results is at least 2 grams. The American Heart Association recommends foods fortified with plant sterols for people with levels of LDL cholesterol over 160 milligrams per deciliter (4.1 mmol/L). <br>  <br>  However, if you don't like the taste of margarine and don't want to give up butter completely, consider using whipped butter or light or reduced-calorie butter. There are also spreadable butters with vegetable oils added. Per serving, these products have less fat and calories than regular butter. The important thing is to use these products in small amounts — just enough to add flavor to the foods you're eating.|`|4S6V4sb4aa	Butter is better for you,, Check out the links..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/margarine.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.breakthechain.org/exclusives/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://docgerrytan.com/2006/10/27/butter-or-margarine-what-is-better/" rel="nofollow">http://docgerrytan.com/2006/10/27/butter...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drcranton.com/nutrition/margarin.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drcranton.com/nutrition/marga...</a><br>  <br>  Hope i helped..|`|zFwjZy53aa	butter, it's made from milk which is natural, just get it unsalted.|`|AA11451041	BUTTER VERSES MARGARINE<br>  <br>  DID YOU KNOW... The difference between margarine and butter?<br>  <br>  Both have the same amount of calories Butter is slightly higher in saturated fats at 8 grams compared to 5 grams. Eating margarine can increase heart disease in women by 53% over eating the same amount of butter according to a recent Harvard Medical Study<br>  <br>  Eating butter increases the absorption of many other nutrients in other foods Butter has many nutrional benefits where margarine has a few only because they are added! Butter tastes much better then margarine and it can enhance the flavours of other foods. Butter has been around for centuries where margarine has been around for less then 100 years Now for Margarine... very high in Trans Fatty Acids Triple risk of Coronary Heart Disease Increases total and LDL ( this is the bad cholesterol) Lowers HDL cholesterol * and this is the good one Increases the risk of cancers by up to five fold. Lowers quality of breast milk. Decreases immune response. Decreases insulin response.<br>  <br>  And here is the most disturbing fact....<br>  <br>  Margarine is but ONE MOLECULE from being PLASTIC...<br>  <br>  ( this fact alone was enough to have me avoiding margarine for life and anything else that is hydrogenated , this means hydrogen is added changing the molecular structure of the food )<br>  <br>  YOU can try this yourself, purchase a tub of margarine and leave it in your garage or shaded area, within a couple of days you will note a couple of things, no flies, not even those pesky fruit flies will go near it,( that should tell you something) it does not rot, smell differently...Because it has no nutritional value, nothing will grow on it, even those teeny weeny microorganisms will not a find a home to grow...Why? because it is nearly plastic.

They are so nice and chewy.  Very comforting somehow.<br>  <br>  You could learn to make real ramen, or you could scout your town for REAL chinese food (not americanized chinese food) restaurants.  A REAL chinese food restaurant may serve proper ramen.|`|2448af06b59df00dd8a1a3ac6d057c75aa	beef|`|eL268hETaa	Go to your local grocery store in the soup aisle.  You can buy 6 flavors for a dollar.  Oriental is good.  So is creamy chicken, roast beef.  There is no meat in them.  Only flavor.  They are not instant.  They must be cooked.  Just be prepared for super L-O-N-G noodles that a person can choke on.  I always drain off the cooking water and THEN add the seasoning packet to intensify the flavors and make a coated dish of noodles rather than a soup.<br>  <br>  For the record, Miso is seaweed.|`|UDl8Ac76aa	There's many type of ramen. Do you have Ajisen over there? It's not just beef ramen. It's usually Chasiu Men (ramen with pork cutlet) that people usually eat. You can also expect it in the Chinese restaurant since ramen is originally from China.|`|le0zdEmVaa	Real ramen is soooo good.

I"m a vegetarian and I always have a lot of protein, and I hate tofu loll<br>  <br>  Its the best to be one because you are healthy as a horse and you won't have that excess fat and food inside your intestines that most red meats do.<br>  You also will weigh less, and hey, what person doesn't like that??<br>  <br>  Here's what I eat and my protein is perfect<br>  <br>  I eat lots of beans (Lima, Soy, red kidney, black, navy- RAW; never in can(but that is just my choice-if you wanted canned its NOOOO PROBLEM)<br>  <br>  Try Quinoa too, you can find it in your grain,beans, or nut ailes<br>  <br>  I also eat lots of salad with tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, carrots-yum yum!<br>  <br>  Since you choose to eat cheese-I'd suggest you go for this yogurt called "Fage 0" or "Chobani" yogurt (it has about 15 grams of protein in it I believe)... ummm lets see, what else? theres Goat cheese and ALL goat products which I consider to eat if my protein is too low. <br>  <br>  ALL vegetables are fun and easy to cook-I like broccoli, asparagus, yams, pumpkin, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower-and you can do whatever you want with it (fry, boil, steam, baked...etc.)<br>  <br>  Have you ever heard of Matzo's? they are crackers that have 4 grams of fat per serving (1) and only has 21 grams to 27 grams of carbs in it depending on which version you get. BUT make sure you get the 100% whole wheat ones ya know?-just to be the healthiest<br>  The calories range from like 90 to 120 calories too! Oh, did i mention they are extremely delicious!?<br>  <br>  Also try very hard not to eat beef, it is very bad for you and does not leave your intestine for months and months (look it up on internet...its the worse food for you-unless used in moderation and VERY VERY small portions)<br>  <br>  Brown rice or even white rice are great too<br>  Miso soups are fantastic as well as any other soup (that have very little sodium)<br>  <br>  you should include more fruit in your diet too babe<br>  <br>  Ok, thats all i can think about now off the top of my head, if you need to know anymore then just message me k?<br>  <br>  Take care|`|afaAhlbGaa	It seems that you have posted this in the wrong section. <br>  <br>  Fish isn't a vegetarian food, and fish oils are certainly not vegetarian. <br>  <br>  Once you have stopped being a meat eater, perhaps come back to this section?<br>  <br>  If you are worried about what to eat just have a steak.|`|9WhK5sSvaa	Make sure you eat green leafy veggies, nuts and whole grains.

And yes, backwash is yucky!|`|uT44Ae03aa	I always wonder what people are thinking when they share drinks. Herpes, hepatitis, and colds can be fairly easily shared along with the drink. Sometimes these illnesses don't show symptoms even to the infected person while they are contagious. Drinks aren't that expensive, I'd highly reccomend each person getting their own. I only share drinks with one person and I'm pretty sure we already have each others germs anyway.|`|Yl8JZrataa	I do it all the time. But I only share drinks with opposite gender because if I shared with a guy, that would be weird. Anyway, if it's like a total stranger and he's sick, I suggest not to share. <br>  <br>  Backwash is when the person puts a mouthful of food or liquid in their mouth and spits it back out in the same container. Nasty? Yes.|`|9WhK5sSvaa	If you have to share a drink do it the smart way...ask for another glass and split it..if you really have to share a drink from something like a bottle, be smart...take the first half then give it to the other person. not so great for them cuz now they get your germs but ok for you if your the protective and possibly selfish type. But seriously, sharing drinks is the same as swapping spit...what they have you have!!!<br>  DON'T DO IT!!!!|`|rOBTQctfaa	Not so bad.  Assuming you know that they do not have herpes or a cold or flu.

Unless the little black flecks upset you, you can substitute. McCormick or Spice Island white pepper costs about $4.00 a jar.  Badia brand white pepper can be found in the ethnic/Spanish spice section of your grocery store for about 59-cents.|`|Or6RoRWDaa	Yes, it should definitely be in your local grocery store.

af7783a091daed724c2cdddd7761475aaa	The safest way to thaw meat is in your refrigerator.  Boneless chicken breasts should thaw overnight.  If you find they are still just a little frozen when you need to use them, you can place them in a colander and run cold water over them for a while.  I would advise AGAINST letting water in the package because this will only result in soggy chicken.<br>  <br>  If you need to really expedite thawing you can try your microwave.  Many microwave ovens have a "thaw" setting that works ok.  My problem with using this method is that somehow the meat always starts to actually cook a little on the outside before it is thawed on the inside, but in a pinch this can work.<br>  <br>  Whatever you do, do NOT thaw anything on your counter at room temperature.  I know thousands of people do this and will swear it's safe, but you are taking a big risk leaving a high protein food at room temperature for a long period of time.   <br>  <br>  Good luck with your fried chicken and kudos for teaching yourself how to cook.  I tried doing that but finally threw in the towel and actually went to cooking school!|`|UDfJQ3i9aa	For one you are supposed to thaw it in the fridge but who has time for that?!? LOL <br>  <br>  <br>  I always put it in the sink and add lukewarm water to cover; change the water every 1/2 hour and flip over the bag that it's in. <br>  <br>  It should take about an hour to two hours to thaw.|`|eL268hETaa	Take it out of the plastic or box...

Doing this, you should have the pieces thawed in about an hour or so.  Alternately, you can add the water, and change it out periodically (about every 15 minutes).<br>  <br>  Ideally, you should plan ahead for this sort of work-intensive meal, and take the chicken out to allow it to thaw properly in the refrigerator overnight, but the water will do in a pinch.|`|zn0pXkc0aa	I defrost chicken breasts in my microwave oven.

1uM9p96eaa	if you'r doing a project of an italian restaurant abroad you can use some names like anna's, ***'s, ****'s, etc... but they don't actually exist in italy... so, if you are looking for an italian name, try with "al laghetto", "all'angolo", "antica trattoria", "antica osteria"... these are very very common... i really like "un pasto al sole" that someone suggested! it sounds very nice, being a pun: un posto al sole it's a famous sentence related to naples and sunny places in the south of italy.

You can use your oven too, but you have to keep a very close eye on it to make sure your food does not reach whatever temperature you're trying to avoid (I try to not go above 100 degrees F just to be safe, but I believe the highest temp allowed is 115F). <br>  <br>  You can also use the power of the sun! This also requires lots of supervision because sun-warmed food can get very hot, and if you put your food outside you could get critters in it.|`|Jm6Vtptuaa	a dehydrator<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfoodtalk.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfoodtalk.com</a>|`|64554a8e1157e502654f643d0ffe309baa	I'm trying to transition to a raw food diet myself.

5zNwBQZHaa	I think it depends on the nature of the event.  Fairs and carnivals, home baked goods do well.  But for sporting events - baked items tank, no one buys them.  Sporting events want MEAT - hamburgers, hot dogs, etc.<br>  <br>  For a fair - the jumbo cookies and brownies are always a good seller, try making them stand out in anyway you can: press M&Ms into the top of cookies, drip them half in white chocolate or butterscotch coating, or drizzle melted chocolate over the top for an unusual design.  Just anything to make them stand out more.<br>  <br>  Also - try rice crispy treats but add colorful cereal like Fruit Loops or Lucky Charms to them.  Then dip half of each one in chocolate or other coating.<br>  <br>  One trick - try having a crock pot of melted chocolate and offer to dip any baked good in it for an additional 50 cents.  You would be surprised at the number of people who will go for that!  Also try to keep them warm - baked goods are sooooo much better warm.<br>  <br>  Smell sells - although it might be a bit difficult to get the smell out into the crown unless you have a trailer that has an oven in it - but if you can manage it, it will greatly influence sales.|`|MS6IzOPLaa	Cookies and brownies are always good sellers at these types of events.  You do, however, want to have smaller versions available too, as it is always nice to be able to buy something for 50 cents.  With jumbo items, the price has to be significantly higher to compensate for the cost.

If not, do your best to buy one during December...they are on sell for about $60.00 at places such as Walmart, Target, and etc.  Do not buy a low wattage such as 700.  But one over 1000w.  Mine is 1100w.<br>  <br>  There are only two of us at home and we found out that the now frozen dinners are delicious and most are healthy with no preservatives.  Buy the top known brands.  We like the ones in the "red" boxes.<br>  <br>  Here is a typical weekly dinner for us:<br>  We both have our own frozen dinner;<br>  Canned pears or other fruits;<br>  Small can of vegetables;<br>  Can of sweet potatoes or bake two potatoes in the microwave;<br>  Ready made frozen pie, or a dessert from the deli, or ice cream cups.<br>  Give it a try for one week and see what you think.<br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is buy pre-cooked meats in sealed packages such as pot roast, chicken, pork chops, ham, meatloaf, etc. Divide them into meals and freeze them. We do this often.  Ask a grocery store clerk to help you find these pre-cooked meats. They are in the refridgeration section.<br>  <br>  The boxed pasta dinners are delicious.  Just follow the directions on the boxes.  You will find these on the shelf at your grocery store.  Each box has a packet of spices.  <br>  <br>  You can buy cups of rice, stuffing, etc. for one person.  Just add water.  Follow directions on the containers.<br>  <br>  Canned soups with a sandwich make great dinners or lunches.<br>  <br>  Canned stew are very good.<br>  <br>  Bagged salad greens will often give you two or three salads.  BE SURE TO READ THE DATES.  Buy the ones that have been washed twice. Salad greens go bad fast.<br>  <br>  Cerals are good for supper.<br>  <br>  Eggs are also good for supper as in fried egg sandwiches.<br>  <br>  Grilled cheeses with soup.<br>  <br>  Spam can be fried or eaten cold on bread.<br>  <br>  Canned fish such as kippers, sardines, tuna, salmon (I like to put a little soy sauce or salsa on kippers and sardines).|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Try recipezaar.com for a host of easy to make meal ideas.|`|UM0AciUmaa	Hi!

Then, my favorite type party is a theme party. It makes ideas a lot easier.

izueNNhuaa	Menu:<br>  Definitely use food coloring in drinks like water or sprite, to make it look more attractive. Main course can just be something simple, but with decorations on the plate or the table (e.g. glitter, candles). Pudding can be a floating island (but that might be hard to make), or simply dipping various fruit into a massive bowl of liquid chocolate... Always a success.<br>  <br>  Games:<br>  You can have a massaging station, along with "professional" masseuse, "professional" massaging equipment (wooden spoons, wet Flannel), various body lotions, scented candles, relaxing music and white towels. Have face sauna's: Just heat up some water, put it in a bowl, put your face right above the bowl and cover your head with a towel so the steam can cleanse your skin. The effect is amazing. You can also have manicures, pedicures, make-up and dress-up. Also, you can do hand drawn "tattoos". Practice some motives first and then draw them intricately down the arm.<br>  <br>  Outfits:<br>  Wear bright leggins or ankle socks, some high boots, a casual, colourful top and a simple short dress. Accessorize with subtle, but colourful accessories. Use a nice headband.<br>  <br>  Movie:<br>  Show something very easy to watch, like a chick flick or something, and make it just slightly too old for them. Tell them about it before, even a "12" is cool at eleven.

JmZQXyyyaa	In my kitchen, I pour off the hot water and shock the eggs in an ice bath.  This causes the egg inside to shrink away from the shell and the albumen (that clear skin on the inside).  Once cooled in this ice bath, tap, then roll the egg on a hard surface to crack the shell all over.  Starting at the fatter end where the air sac is, begin the peel, and the shell should nearly come off in one piece.  <br>  Some people say to add salt to the water, but it toughens the egg, not that many people notice.  The ice method is most reliable.|`|sH9lfyeNaa	I must agree with the 1 tbls. vinegar in the water I also put 1 tbls. salt while the eggs are boiling.  I bring them to a hard boil, turn off heat, then cover with a lid and let them sit 5 minutes.  It is best to run cold water over them until they are completely cold.  Tapping and rolling them also helps with the removal of the shell.|`|eL268hETaa	Yes, fresh eggs are hard to peel after cooking.  Run them under ice water right afterward helps.  So does adding a tablespoon of vinegar to the cooking water.|`|AA11417242	Put in the ice cold water right after you boil the eggs. Crack around the egg shell on hard surface then peel.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	It is because the shell are so soft, older eggs peel easier.<br>  Peeling under running water seems to help.<br>  Try cracking and rolling on the counter and peel from the air sac end.|`|FBhjhjR0aa	Let them cool off for at least 20 minutes, it's best to let them soak in cool water after boiling. Then tap the bottom and top of the egg, til it cracks, then it should be easy to peel away the shell, it also helps if you peel them while holding them under running water. Only if you have a garbage disposal on your sink.|`|nOVSf06Raa	You are best to use older eggs for this, fresh eggs are still coated with albumin that has not yet detached from the shell it takes a few days to come loose from the shell this is what makes the eggs so difficult to peel , when hard boiled eggs are desired you are best to add 1 tbs of white vinegar o the water this will  help on releasing the albumin .|`|V58rYfEsaa	hahaha..I have that prob all the time with my fresh eggs,,Ive tried all the "tricks" as everyone above has mentioned...but nothing works.<br>  I make sure I use older eggs for boiling,, as someone mentioned,,they do have like a little air/gas  gap around them where the white has separated from the shell.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	You can do what my friend does, she cuts the eggs in half for deviled-eggs and runs a spoon around inside the shell and takes them out that way. Works pretty good with hard-boiled fresh eggs, smoother than ripping off the shell and less waste.|`|PpWosZsIaa	After Boiling, Drop them in an Ice Bath (Cold Water with Ice added)

sqPglTDVaa	I use on teaspoon of dried for one tablespoon of fresh (using a 20ml tablespoon). I prefer the flavor of fresh but they aren't always available and my gardening isn't that good! I also check my dried herbs before I use them, if they are kept too long they loose their flavor.<br>  <br>  Both fresh and dried herbs contain beneficial phytochemicals.  For example curcumin in turmeric, capsaicin in chilli and allicin in garlic. I found the following article interesting if your interested in the health benefits of herbs:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.taste.com.au/news+features/articles/554/spice+of+life" rel="nofollow">http://www.taste.com.au/news+features/ar...</a>|`|ttfuh5pKaa	Because of their more intense concentrated flavor, dried herbs can be substituted for fresh herbs at a ratio of 1 to 3. While dried herbs are convenient and can be great for longer cooking times, they don't generally have the same purity of flavor as fresh herbs and they go stale quickly. Ensure dried herbs are still fresh by checking if they are green and not faded, and crushing a few leaves to see if the aroma is still strong. Always store them in an air-tight container away from light and heat.|`|2qbLrHBKaa	Dried is 1/3 the amount of fresh. It probably doesn't make that much of a difference health-wise, you're only working with 1 Tbs in a whole dish then there aren't that many health benefits involved. And being dried doesn't make that much of a difference.|`|61dc30ed218b2dec3b7cc598327fec88aa	there aren't any health benefits that are lost when you use dried herbs.  1 tbsp fresh = 1 tsp dried|`|lTkYWiy5aa	1 tsp dried = 1tbsp fresh. It won't be as tasty, so use fresh when possible.|`|MhfneF0xaa	Equal measure. Fresh tastes better. No health difference.<br>  <br>  Now here's a big secret to using dried herbs: Rub / crumble them between the palms of your hands before adding them to the recipe. This bruises the dried herbs, and helps bring out their flavor.

I always try to educate peoples of the horrors of the slaughter house, but i never try to change them. Make sure you're 100% commited, otherwise once you start you may never be able to eat meat again even if you wanted to. Whenever i even think about eating meat i throw up even though i never would. <br>  <br>  Once your commited give up everything but like fish and stuff with broth in it. Then give up fish, then the broth. Also you can try donating money to your local shelter. Try volunteering too. Plus you can foster animals. Good luck!

DFshzoJkaa	Good for you!!  Wanting to change and realizing that you no longer want the crutch of alcohol.... means you can definitely turn things around.  Usually social phobias come from not having confidence in oneself or low self esteem.  You should realize:  "Its not other people who prevent us from doing something.... its our own fears and what we THINK other people feel about us that hold us back."  So there really is no logic in having a social phobia.  Dont let you mind run wild, cus what you think people are thinking... really isnt the case.  You have to take control of your own life.  Dont let fears or phobias dictate how you do things or prevent you from acheiving your goals.  There are a lot of negative people in this world who get a thrill in trying to make people fall and relish in their misery (like Shadow and the first answer).  Don't give them the satisfaction.  Just stop drinking!  Its as simple as that.  And dont let ANYONE goad you into changing your mind.  Booze is not a cure for anything.  In fact, booze is a problem, not a solution.  How many people have you heard of claim they're a success because of their drinking?  No one.  Booze drags EVERYONE down.  Anyway, hope I helped.

NRAE17UUaa	My dad was mad when i became vegetarian. He thought I would be unhealthy and get sick. <br>  I'm Mexican and my family eats a lot of meat, so they thought it would be hard for me to do it too, and expensive.<br>  <br>  I went for it anyways. And guess what?<br>  I lost a healthy amount of weight, I'm healthier than I was before! I get sick LESS often then before. I never have colds and i never get stomach viruses. <br>  Money wise; being a vegetarian can be cheaper. Sometimes I just omit the meat from the dinner my mom makes and add more vegetables. It isn't a big difference. My mom buys less meat and a little more vegetables.<br>  Tofu is really good too, I suggest Morning Star products, they taste the best. They sell tofu at most supermarkets. I get mine at Walmart. It's an average price, usually. They sell patties, buffulo wings, deli slices, chicken nuggets, ground tofu, ribs, bacon, corn dogs, and other things that are completely vegetarian and sometimes vegan friendly.<br>  Tofu tastes a lot better than people think.<br>  I went vegetarian around your age, and like I said, I'm still healthy. If you need to, get b12 vitamins. <br>  <br>  Good luck :]|`|LzJMaw2Iaa	First of all, you need to do some research and find out what it actually means to be a vegetarian.  There are actually several different versions.  Some people will still eat fish even though it's technically meat.  Some people will not eat any meat, but still consume eggs or other products from animals or made with animal fat.  Then there are vegans, who do not consume anything that comes from or is made with animals or parts thereof.<br>  <br>  You'll also want to look at what vitamins and minerals you would normally get from meat that you'll now be missing and need to replace somehow.  For example, if you're going to stop eating beef, learn to like spinach.<br>  <br>  Once you have as much information as you can find, talk to your dad and explain not just your choice, but the reasons for it (and I assume you do have a reason, right?), and that you understand both the positive and negative aspects of your decision in terms of diet.|`|ltHslyCeaa	I'm a vegetarian and my dad is well.... let's just say he's a carnivore. I started it out as saying, "Hey dad! Do you think I could be vegetarian for a week?" He said, "Nope." And I said, "Let's bet." He agreed, at the end of the week I got him to "dare" me to another week and continued doing that until he just forgot and being vegetarianism was just part of my life. When it came up, I explained to him my reasoning (make sure you have your facts). Now, 6 months later, he even buys me veggie burgers :)|`|96Frq9uUaa	You could just tell him that you want to try it out for a bit.

AA12334360	I didn't know we did, but thanks for telling me what i do, much appreciated.<br>  <br>  by the way, you don't have to eat meat when you go out with your friends. no-one in the USA died from skipping the ocassional meal.|`|lzjtINvCaa	because they are  fanatics.that is what pisses me off about leaf lickers if they don't want to eat meat that's fine but don't condemn me for eating meat|`|FicyC2TXaa	That's a sweeping generalisation. If you used to be a vegetarian you know that vegetarians aren't all of one mind and don't all have identical personalities and behaviours.<br>  <br>  Who is shunning you?<br>  <br>  I don't know anyone - vegetarian, vegan or meat-eater - who shuns people on the basis of their dietary choices.|`|d41bd2987be2bbb3bb7086e0162c5b82aa	... I don't judge anyone for what they choose to eat. It's a waste of energy to focus on someone ele's lifestyle. I don't think omnivores and ex-vegetarians are lesser people just because they want to eat meat. It's their choice and I'm in no position to speculate or judge.|`|asXq2cFDaa	I don't shun them.<br>  I also am not particularly liking them.<br>  I see no point to go back.<br>  Then again, it really depends on the person, some people have sever allergies and can not go vegan.<br>  Vegetarian can be done with almost any allergies though.|`|64554a8e1157e502654f643d0ffe309baa	I will be honest, I don't like ex-vegans or ex-vegetarians because many of them seem to be arrogant and pushy about putting down their former dietary choices. But these are usually adults who have all the ability in the world to control their diet.  I think in your case it's a bit different seeing how you are obviously a kid and at the mercy of what your parents feed you. I will not and cannot hold that against you as I have been in similar situations myself in the past. All I can do is wish you the best of luck in the future. <br>  <br>  <br>  However, I go food shopping once a week and eat up all the veggies I buy before they go bad. Maybe you are over estimating how many you can eat in that time frame? I know it took me awhile to figure it out myself. When I first went vegan I purchased way too many fruits and veggies.  Also, you can freeze certain foods. Grapes for example make for tasty treats if you put them in a freeze safe tuperware cup and stick them in the freezer. Very tasty and sweet. Tofu can also be frozen, in fact it improves the texture. Soy yogurts are delicious when frozen.|`|96Frq9uUaa	Well, not all vegetarians do that. I'm a vegetarian and one of my friends went back to eating meat, it didn't bother me at all, it was her own personal decision. But i do know what you're talking about. I think some vegetarians feel like the people that go back to eating meat are "abandoning the cause" or they might see it as hypocritical. I personally don't agree with that, but it may be the reason. In my opinion, everyone has the right to make their own choices in life, and shouldn't be penalized for making a decision like that. I hope i helped a little! : )|`|f2e98bba2a3d3f33ea4e923e35df9c6aaa	Well They Might believe your a hypocrite. And Some Vegitarians Don't believe anyone should eat meat. I think that its perfectly fine (be being a vegitarian myself) if you go back to eating meat, You need protein, and some people do it just for the animals and love meat a lot. So If they shun you, Thats there problem.|`|07h7QByDaa	I don't shun anyone based on diet choice, but I do find it a little hypocritical of people to go PETA-nazi for a week, only to whine about it being too hard and going back to eating meat. :/|`|T32hOtKtaa	i dont shun them :( thaz kinda mean
cthzuKAraa	Water is also a very important substance because it can flush toxins and clean your insides. Yes, this person would definately lack a wide range of essential nutrients such as calcium and vitamins from vegetables. Also, eating too many of one kind of food, no matter how healthy it is can give you negative effects. For example, if you eat 3 large appleas a day for a period of time, that might be a starting point to diabetes since there is so much sugar. <br>  <br>  Plus, wouldn't this kid get sick of those 3 things? I know I would!|`|famao81gaa	Not at all. I saw a documentary movie back in the 1960's where a tribe in the South Pacific ate only sweet potatoes. They supplemented with a roast pig once per year for the males only. They all were said to be healthy.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Yes, you would. Unless he takes multivitamins and iron pills.|`|9O5Y1Kavaa	You can but you can die  very early.<br>  <br>  Back in the 1700's amd 1800's, the poors diet mostly consisted of bread and soup
XcNoptFbaa	We have one and we love it. I made butter pecan ice cream last weekend, and I'm making strawberry this weekend. It works really good. It comes with a recipe book of ice creams and sorbets. It freezes in 25 minutes and comes out like soft serve. We like it harder so I put it in a container and put it in the freezer. Hope this helps.|`|nOVSf06Raa	unless you want to buy mixes for it you can look up recipes and find  a lot on line here is one for you to give you an idea of what you will need<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cuisinart.com/recipes/recipe.php?recipe_id=101" rel="nofollow">http://www.cuisinart.com/recipes/recipe....</a>|`|cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	Nothing more than fruit, cream, yougart, sugar and if you want to make an egg based one you can, the instructions will give you there recipes and as you progress you can make up ones of you own. It is worth buying if you want to save money and make it 2-3 times a week.|`|bu82soQraa	You should!<br>  No specials things really need to be bought just fruits sugars cream and all that. I'm pretty sure it will come with some recipes too.
acVPPTD2aa	Bananas are the coolest Yo../<br>  But too much potassium leads to an increase in your metabolism. <br>  When you have too much potassium it's called Hyperkalemia.<br>  Symptoms are fairly nonspecific and generally include malaise, palpitations and muscle weakness; mild hyperventilation may indicate a compensatory response to metabolic acidosis, which is one of the possible causes of hyperkalemia. Often, however, the problem is detected during screening blood tests for a medical disorder, or it only comes to medical attention after complications have developed, such as cardiac arrhythmia or sudden death.|`|Q4oPyclQaa	I'm really curious.... how long have you been doing this diet?<br>  <br>  I don't think more bananas will make you gain weight really.  I don't know if anything on a raw foodist diet can make you gain weight.  Maybe if you eat too many nuts.|`|wtg8vtzBaa	Bananas are about 100 calories each.  As long as your calorie intake exceeds your output, you will gain weight.  If you're really interested in gaining (muscle) weight, eat more protein-rich foods and consider eating dairy products.|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	They are about 100 calories each. I don't think bananas are toxic in anyway but that would be about 40g fiber from them, which is ok in a day, except there's whatever else you're eating and that might be a problem. You're probably already getting that much fiber if you eat only fruit, nuts & veggies. I"ve never eaten 80+ grams of fiber in a day. I think the most I've eaten is 60g and it was uncomfortable.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	Maybe. 10 bananas is almost all of your daily calories. So if you eat it with a ton of other food, like mostly nuts and avacados, and some low fat fruits and veggies plus lift weights to gain muscle, I think you'd gain some. weight.|`|7P3TSjaZaa	Wow and i though my diet was strict. My recomendation if you wanna gain weight get off the Fruitarian diet. Im 6.1/2 and im a vegetarian and weigh 165. Hope this helps I dont think the bannanas will help any.|`|c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	Depends on how much you exercise, what your metabolism is like, etc.<br>  I believe that humans are best 'designed' for fruit consumption, but I would guess that fruit does not increase the weight of a person, no matter how much is eaten.  I can't see anyone gaining 'fat' weight with fruit.  You could gain muscle weight though by exercising your muscles more, perhaps with weight training or other forms of exercise. Or perhaps increasing your rich fruit intake such as coconut or other fruit that contain oils or hardier forms of carbs, i.e. denser and less water.  This is my educated guess.|`|afaAhlbGaa	I wouldn't recommend increasing a daily intake of any particular food. Too much of anything can be bad for us.<br>  <br>  I recommend looking up some recipes, joining a vegan forum for ideas for recipes and meal plans.<br>  <br>  Instead of snacking through out the day, try healthy between meal snacks and have good sized portions of food.<br>  <br>  If you are not already doing so, add cold pressed olive oil (raw) to your diet. A large spoonful of this in home made guacamole or a sprouted hummus will add to a healthy fat content too. <br>  <br>  The key is not to increase foods which may have bad effects in the long term. <br>  <br>  Learn how to make 'cashew nut cheese' style fillings. These go great in marinated mushrooms and such meals are really filling too.<br>  <br>  Good luck, I hope to go back to being raw food vegan some time in the future|`|a5b833f1cecfc7eab7869f5ea4fe43f1aa	Bananas are calorie-dense, so it would help, but I think eating more nuts and avocados would be more effective.
0PQdeKzaaa	Hi as an adult the weekly alcohol unit intake for a male is 21 units so your only just over the intake by 3 units so although your just over its not too bad ... hope this helps|`|1glKIE5Baa	yeah i think thats pretty bad to be honest, i mean u dont need to look at all the statistics and guidelines to work that out do you? its alcohol!<br>  <br>  your gonna get a well bad beer belly soon lol|`|2LJV50vhaa	I stopped doing that a long time ago,beer is now about 16 pounds a gallon,its cheaper to drink petrol.I had a mate who was a steel erector,he could drink over 40 pints in one day,he died when he was 43 from a fall.|`|XwacWyy6aa	12 pints is fine and within the recommended limit.  But pathetic!  You're 18, you should be out getting absolutely plastered!|`|OFCCgLdKaa	If you're used to drinking that much then no problem really, as long as you don't consume that level of alcohol daily or every two or three days you should be alright.|`|er4Y3RSGaa	no that's only like 5 40s that's not nearly enough|`|AA11822515	Over the course of a weekend, 12 pints of lager isn't a great amount to drink. <br>  <br>  This also depends on how much you drink during the week too though.<br>  <br>  Just be careful and don't become reliant on it, otherwise you will have problems.|`|L5tWiYOFaa	It's not nearly good enough I'm afraid, try to aim for an infinitely more respectable 18 pints over a weekend, that'll definitely earn you a lot more respect.|`|nmC7qgtZaa	No its not i'd got through between a bottle and two bottles of whisky a weekend an im 20 thats pretty bad|`|xYg6Dl4qaa	you're fine...12 pints is about average
iHFZLsDTaa	Have you tried the new way for baking potatoes?  Wrap them tightly in plastic wrap, do not pierce, cook on high for 7 to 8 minutes.  You can do this with sweet potatoes too.|`|e6nOTM2eaa	Yes you can do them in the microwave too.  It is a longer cooking time however.  They are not as dense as regular Idahos.  So they take about twice as long.<br>  Step1 Wash the sweet potato you don't know who handled it in the store. Mine came out of our garden. <br>  Step2 Take paper towel and wet it down. <br>  Step3 Now wrap your sweet potato in that wet paper towel. <br>  Step4 Put the wrapped sweet potato in the microwave. <br>  Step5 My microwave has a potato button. Set it for the 2 potato setting. <br>  Step6 When baked take it out of microwave and cut it in half. Add butter, brown sugar, and cinnamon.|`|xb9yYWB1aa	yes you can make the sweet potatoes in the microwave, it depends on the size of the potato for the cooking time though, if its about the same size as a regular potato, it will be a similar cooking time. just make sure to poke holes in the potato before cooking it so it doesn't explode on yo =]|`|9jCP4STQaa	no you can't but a sweet potatoes in the microwave be cuz potatoes and sweet potatoes are a lot defert|`|B79lX9Inaa	They are the same cooking time, I mean assuming the sweet potatoe is the same size as the irish potatoe.

AWT6sFA7aa	yes i recommend using butter all of the time  never ever use a substitute it has trans fatty acids the (bad kind)  and blocks omega 3 and 6 fatty acids ( the good kind) hope i helped<br>  <br>  oh and the whole stick make a amazing alfredo sauce|`|hKlsJgVSaa	All sticks of butter/margerine are 8 tbsp (1/2 cup).<br>  <br>  Butter is better. Only use butter-margerine is 1 chemical reaction away from being a plastic.<br>  <br>  Use equal parts.|`|YuYSL0A2aa	Most of the time butter can be used instead of margarine and I always use butter in mine since it turns out richer tasting with butter. <br>  Use the same amount of butter as the recipe calls for (1/2 cup = 8 tbspn), or you can use a little less if you don't want as rich of sauce (maybe 6 or 7 tbspn) and just add a touch more milk or cream. <br>  <br>  Good luck and enjoy your meal!|`|64a4NB15aa	For gods sake use butter not margarine . Margarine is a trans-fat . The measurement is exactly the same unless you do not want it so rich then use a little less.|`|AA11136470	yes you can use 1/2 cup of butter instead of the margarine|`|aCoiEfQmaa	If I were you, i would just use the whole stick of butter, or three quarters of it.|`|AA11786341	add a half cup of margarine
wLgGD63raa	If it was only 1-5 hours for the most part everything should be okay. If the refrigerator was still cold when you opened I wouldn't worry about it too much. When food sits out at a temperature between 41-135 degrees they start to collect bacteria. The warmer it gets the more they multiply and after about four hours food can be deemed harmful if eaten, and according to the books needs to be thrown at.<br>  <br>  If the fridge was still cool when you opened it I wouldn't fuss about it too much as it was only for a short amount of time. If it was warm when opened you may want to throw away your dairy products, meats, and eggs as these could cause you to get sick if eaten.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Keep it closed, only open it when you absolutely have to, and only for a second.|`|i5OVORXgaa	If it's still cold then it should be fine. If you have any butter in there then check if it's started melting yet.|`|AA10032971	Your food should be fine. As long as the refrigerator remained closed, you are safe. Peace!|`|BM9oGl8maa	it should be okay. as long as you didn't open the fridge with the power off. the fridge should be insulated enough to keep the cold in and keep the food fresh enough. but you might want to check the food before eating it.|`|F2ugW4cRaa	It will be fine, it is unlikely anything would have spoiled.|`|Q4oPyclQaa	It's probably okay as long as you didn't keep the fridge open.  If you didn't open it at all, almost all of the cold should have stayed in, and your fridge temperature wouldn't have dropped by more than a few degrees.<br>  <br>  Your food is fine, unless you were holding the door open freaking out about the food. :P
eBvVi7y1aa	some people can some people can't! me and MOST of my friends can be really good when we are drunk! like the other day we were drunk off our asses and walked right into my house and my mom never suspected a thing. so it really depends on the person. it depends on their weight, age, gender, ect. but for the most part if you are one over your drunkenness line you'll be pretty normal and can do all the things you usally do...you'll just be really happy and i little slower!! =) hoped this helped!!!!!!!!!!!|`|LlXH8yGcaa	I've been drunk enough that I have no memory and pass out places, but judging from my email sent box, I am very capable of expressing myself in legible english with a fair bit of German, French, Latin, and fake Gaelic thrown in.  Also, because I have gmail set to make me answer math questions if I try to send an email late at night in order to prevent me from sending horrible, horrible, drunk emails, I now know I can do math even when blackout drunk.  <br>  If gin is involved though, all this is out the window and I spout crazy **** and don't know where I live and end up in strange parts of town under strange people's beds.  So, it depends.|`|ygTSKitBaa	I have been too drunk to stand on many occasions, but I could still do all the things you mentioned above, just a little slower than when I was sober lol.<br>  Being drunk doesn't really make you forget things, in fact, sometimes it helps you remember things better.<br>  It makes you lose your inhibitions and not think about things before you do them.|`|gRXngD9aaa	Mannn, I's drunke know an i stil typ ok.|`|siGCccMDaa	All I can say is that on the odd occasion that I've been HAMMERED lol, I can still read, write,  and all the rest. Typing/writing are a little uncoordinated, but still do-able. If they can do these things sober, they can do them while slightly drunk. Hope that helps.|`|KSK22vHUaa	There are different levels of drunk.  Different people process alcohol at different rates.  Some people are affected more by alcohol than others, at the same time.  Really tiny girls get drunk a lot quicker than really broad guys--the larger the person, the more it will take to get you to the same blood alcohol content, and even then some people are more used to it or feel the effects less than others.<br>  <br>  Wait until you're 21.  Don't drink to get drunk.  Be careful, but have fun.|`|er4Y3RSGaa	because they are not drunk drunk
CGnL2nS0aa	$2.84 per gallon.|`|OFCCgLdKaa	I wonder when Tool are gonna make some new music, it's been nearly three years since 10,000 days...

y6406A92aa	No, I don't think that is true.. :)|`|F2ugW4cRaa	No, but it may upset your stomach.|`|Q4oPyclQaa	No.  If you eat too many pop rocks and drink too much soda you may throw up due to the reaction.  Or you may just have a lot of gas.  Or maybe nothing will happen.  But your head definitely won't explode.|`|3f3c29287aa543056f2f47ef05dbdf6baa	Nope. And please don't give pop rocks to birds either...|`|ILpp3ncYaa	Is the pope Jewish?|`|i5OVORXgaa	Well, not if I do... but maybe you...|`|db06833cd32d477373d0a2c38a077b60aa	yeah man.  the Army uses poprocks and soda in their bombs.  Ever see those explosions?  they are HUGE.<br>  <br>  it is a nasty combo.  In Illinois, you can't even buy poprocks and soda at the same time.  You need a special license to carry both at the same time.|`|vUuD9YExaa	No your head will not explode you just might feel sick after a while.|`|wwaDbsQ2aa	no and yes. only if you have a very lager amount of both i mean alot

db06833cd32d477373d0a2c38a077b60aa	It sure is!  But it is not healthier than any other clean water you would drink.<br>  <br>  There is no way to increase the energy in water.  Nope, none what so ever.  Sure cells exposed to penta water live longer (according to their web site), but compared to what?  being exposed to bleach? an oven?  strontium? <br>  <br>  Drinking water is drinking water.  Sure you can put all of the oxygen you want in it, but water only has a capacity for so much.  Plus, oxygen is oxygen.<br>  <br>  Is drinking water healthy?  yes.   Is penta healthier than other water?  no.

By cutting out all the food you normally eat very suddenly, your body wont have much time to adjust and so as a result, your blood sugar will drop quickly, leaving you feeling tired, head achy, possibly irritable and lethargic. Try eating fruit or maybe drinking fresh fruit juice to help raise your blood sugar levels. <br>  <br>  When you eat a lot of processed food like junk food or soda which are loaded with caffeine, sugar and fat, it makes your sugar levels go sky high and without all that sugar from junk food to keep it going, your body is trying to adapt to life without. Once you get used to it, the tiredness and headaches should go away. Try going to bed early as well, as eight hours of sleep a night can really make a difference. :)<br>  <br>  The best way to start eating healthier or cutting out junk food would be to do so slowly. Having a plate of steamed veggies instead of fries with a meal is a great start, rather than just stopping cold turkey as it just confuses your body. :)|`|Yl8JZrataa	Blueberries. <br>  <br>  A cup a day, keeps the doctors away.<br>  <br>  Blueberries makes better brain function,better digestive, cures head aches, and makes you look younger.|`|9WhK5sSvaa	Sounds like your have sugar withdrawals<br>  eat some fruit and have some flavoured oatmeal<br>  it will fill you up and get rid of cravings and should help with the headache too.|`|eL268hETaa	You are sending your blood sugar on a rollercoaster.

IhGdhL3maa	potatoes, they live on them
MhfneF0xaa	I like tomato soup made with milk instead of water, it seems a lot less acid to me.<br>  <br>  Also, try it with rice in addition to the milk. (Pre-cook a small batch of minute rice, 1/2 cup rice into 1/2 cup boiling water, remove from heat.<br>  <br>  Then make the tomato soup with milk, and stir in the rice.<br>  <br>  One of my all-time favorites!|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	No, that will not work and don't eat anything with tomatoes in it!|`|MbW8KRoGaa	Sugar will not neutralize the acid in the tomato sauce--it merely sweetens the sauce so that the acid is less tart. Since you don't taste as much acidity, it tricks your taste buds into believing that it's less acidic. <br>  Adding some baking soda might help--but you'd have to find a way to measure the pH of the sauce before adding the baking soda, as well as afterward. It may be that you add so much bicarb, that you radically alter the taste of the sauce. Sodium bicarbonate is an amphoteric salt--which means that it makes acidic solutions (like tomato sauce) more alkaline and alkaline solutions (like, um...drain cleaner) more acidic. In either case, it helps to neutralize the pH. <br>  Quite honestly, I'd tell you to not eat tomato sauce at all! But if you're determined to eat tomato sauce, try eating half a banana beforehand; its mucilaginous qualities will help to coat your stomach. You may also want to take an over-the-counter antacid, like one containing the active ingredient Famotidine, about 45 minutes to an hour before dinner--this should not be construed as medical advice! Always ask your doctor before taking a new medication!|`|YuYSL0A2aa	It should help with the acid but I think it would taste funny. I always add a pinch of sugar to tomato based items(tomato soup,chili,spaghetti) and that seems to help.<br>  And do you make your tomato soup with water or milk? Milk seems to tone down the acid as well.|`|vXotXl1Laa	I don't know about baking soda but a dash of sugar neutralized acid in spaghetti sauce.|`|AA10928232	yes, it should help neutralize the acid|`|lckgvz2laa	Try a pinch of sugar instead.
cxNLOPHNaa	It's a common Japanese phonetic misspelling of Crab. The Japanese cannot pronounce the letter "R".<br>  <br>  Clabstick is actually Crabstick... The artificial crab made from Pollack.<br>  <br>  Edit- Very sure. My favourite Japanese market, Mitsuwa,  <a href="http://www.mitsuwa.com/tenpo/torr/eindex.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mitsuwa.com/tenpo/torr/eindex...</a> regulary misspells various words. Such as "fly pan" instead of fry pan and "spounge cake" instead of sponge cake. Also being of Japanese heritage and having Japanese friends and relatives still in Japan... If there was such a thing as "Clab"... I think I would have seen it/tried it at some point during my 46 years of life. As for the quote of "that's not crab"... It's not crab, it's Pollack, which is a fish.|`|M8HVkIikaa	this is <a href="http://www.mstevensandson.co.uk/shop/images/white%20crab%20meat.jpg%20web%20size.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mstevensandson.co.uk/shop/ima...</a>
xa0GaKVbaa	Put them in the pan, and fill them up around 3/4 of the way.. If you have leftover batter, make another round. Don't just put them in the liners and on a regular pan, they'll spread out as they rise and you'll have one gigantic mess! lol|`|d41bd2987be2bbb3bb7086e0162c5b82aa	Place each liner into their individual molds in the cupcake pan. Then, use an icecream scoop to put batter into each individual cup. Fill 2/3-3/4 of the way up from the top to allow room for them to rise.<br>  <br>  If you fill the liners with batter before they are placed in the pan, it's going to be messy and tricky to put them in the pan.<br>  <br>  The cupcakes can't be baked on the liner alone. They will be lop-sided, flat, and uneven.|`|xdqSp48Jaa	You have to put the liners in the pan first, and then fill them to avoid making a mess trying to fit them into the tins.<br>  Enjoy your cupcakes.|`|vXotXl1Laa	It depends on what kind of liner you have. If it's just paper, you want the muffin tin. If you have the aluminum liner they can stand on their own on a cookie sheet. I highly recommend the muffin tin for what you've described. If possible, buy another pan so you can make more at once.|`|AA11786341	since the liners have no structure, they won't hold the batter<br>  without the pan...you'll have a mess<br>  <br>  put the liners in the pan and then batter<br>  <br>  bake <br>  <br>  remove cupcakes to rack and cool while baking the rest|`|lckgvz2laa	Put the liners in the cupcake pan DEFINITELY!|`|48hoL887aa	You need to put them in the pan.

Q4oPyclQaa	Cointreau is a type of triple sec. It's a very high quality and high alcohol triple sec - 40% alcohol (80 proof for you silly americans and your non-standard systems).<br>  <br>  I like cointreau, personally, it's made from orange peels and has a really nice flavour especially in mixed drinks.  I'd go with cointreau since cheaper, lower alcohol triple secs can be made instead with artificial flavours, and since cointreau uses real orange peels it tastes nicer.|`|db06833cd32d477373d0a2c38a077b60aa	triple sec and contreau are really similar: they are orange flavored alcohols.  I would go with contreau in my opinion, just because i like it more.  Sugar is good if you want it sweet.   Just buy a bunch of booze and get mixing.  Plus you get to sample your drinks.<br>  <br>  so get drinking and find out what you like.  then make me one.|`|vEg5czx7aa	Generally a Cosmo is made up of Vodka, Orange Liquor ( Trip. Sec. or Cointreau) a little lime juice and cranberry juice.  I agree with everyone else that Cointreau is better, and as for vodka, personal preference.  I wouldn't go over the top but I also wouldn't go too cheap.  Absolute Cosmo's work just fine.  Experiment with the amounts of everything 'till you find something that works for you.
