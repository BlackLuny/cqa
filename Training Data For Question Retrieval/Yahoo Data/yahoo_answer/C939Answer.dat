AA12016864	And to add insult to injury Royal Mail add a service charge for collecting the money [something like 8 I think]|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Yes you will be charged duty and vat and the post office should collect this from you before handing over the package, acting as agents for hmrc.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Yes you will - about 25% of the value of the goods.|`|S7uh7eG6aa	Oh yes. Amount depends on the tax category of the goods. Usually you get a first class letter saying, pay up or we don't deliver (only more politely) and you have to ring with your credit card and pay. Sometimes you get lucky and customs miss it and it just arrives, but not often. I buy stuff from abroad all the time, and they always catch you with that charge. You can ask them for a list of charges so you will know how much next time - can be between 3% and 100% so you ought to check before you buy.  And of course you have to pay 15% VAT as well. Sorry!

vqdurAA5aa	The KPO__ options are options that were adjusted due to a 1 for 4 reverse split that took place in 2007. The underlying securities for the KPO__ options are 25 shares of Sun stock instead of 100 shares, but the multiplier is still 100. That means if you exercised the KPOAA option you would pay $500 for 25 shares of JAVA. The reverse split effectively quadrupled the strike prices.    http://www.cboe.com/publish/TTStockSM/07...|`|pg5AHNcdaa	Don't mess with options on that junk company. I held sun back when it was sunw, before the reverse split. It was in a better position back then and it's still junk now. Chart it.

e7e1924d8971698b40672960f27475f5aa	You want to balance truth and good "spin." If you were fired, be prepared to explain what you learned. If you left because you weren't happy, be careful how you describe that. Base your description on what you know about the employer. For example, let's say you are talking to an employer who is well known for making employees work hard. If it's true, you could say "I left my last employer because I thrive on challenges -- I really like to stay busy." If you think about, a good answer is really going to depend on why you left your last job, what you are like and what you know about the employer who is asking -- so you'll have to come up with a specific answer yourself. Good luck!|`|4b81a16cbb26c3702aa40a16058d31e4aa	Yes, tell the truth, except for, "I hated my Boss, he was always wrong about everything?"    You have to understand that an extremely general question cannot be given an extremely specific answer.  If you left because you were unhappy and you are unemployed now, then tell them that the previous job no longer held the type of challenge that you were looking for.  If you were fired, you need to be honest and tell them.  If you were "downsized", i.e. laid off or they simply did not need you anymore or they were cutting their workforce, then tell them that.|`|HL3APXLYaa	LOL..I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST TEL THE TRUTH|`|7S5EgDFVaa	You can say you left your position for more advancement opportunities.  Have a career plan in mind.|`|fGqkfLZQaa	If the job you are interviewing for increased responsibilty or money - mention a desire to expand/increase your capabilities.  Honestly explain how you enjoy challenges and unfortunately there weren't adequate opportunities for that growth.

sI3krJULaa	File your return like you normally do, only add your daughter as a dependent.  Then, make sure to enter how much you actually received in 2008 for your stimulus payment.  If you're using tax software, it'll automatically add the $300 to whatever refund you might be due.    Hope that helps. :0)|`|BoAEgaAGaa	When you file your 2008 income tax return there is a line to enter your Recovery Rebate amount.  Since you will qualify for the extra $300 then this is the amount you will enter on this line.      If you are completing your return in a tax program, when prompted, enter the exact amount your received in 2008.  The program then will calculate that you will be eligible for the extra $300 and enter it on the tax return.    Laura H  H&R Block  Senior Tax Advisor 5   **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|AA10469473	Assuming that the total you are eligible for based on your 2008 return is more than you already got, you'll claim the extra on the Recovery Rebate Credit line in the payments section of whatever version of 1040 you file.  There is a worksheet to calculate it.  It will be $300 unless the rest of your eligiibility decreased this year, like if your income decreased drastically or you had another child who turned 17.|`|3M7SDd90aa	It will automatically pop up when you file your taxes.|`|AA11284831	You will pick up the $300 under the Recovery Rebate Credit IF your total entitlement based upon your 2008 return is greater than what you received last year.      There are many possible scenarios where the total based upon your 2008 return would be the same or even less than what you received last year even with the additional $300 for a child this year.  For example if your tax liability on your 2007 return was $1,200 or more you would have received $1,200.  If your tax liability on your 2008 return is $900 or less (and if the numbers are right, the $3,500 exemption for the child CAN do that), the total entitlement will be $1,200 or less and you will not be entitled to any additional stimulus money.

NwkZ5OmCaa	I believe you mean 8453-ol (there are 2 versions, the 8453 is if you need to staple paperwork like schedule D-1s or 8332).    The answer is, we don't know.  I know the IRS was making an effort to get them because people were going nuts getting the temporary DCN to put on the form and calling the IRS to look it up when they couldn't find their original emails.    Whether the fact the form is still missing flips someone into a refund hold program/delay, I haven't seen one yet.  The IRS has not been consistent about this in past years (it never stopped one in the past) and thankfully the form is not used for 2008 or later years.

AA12255473	well, right now it apparently doesn't work.    but the way it's supposed to work is this;  companies need money to finance their business, so they decide how much they think their company is worth and divide it into so many shares.  Each share is a chunk of the value of the company.  so they want people to buy these chunks (meaning to invest in the company).    People can buy shares (chunks of companies) from lots of different  companies.  Say I today i buy 100 shares of company A at $1 each so i pay $100.   then someone else finds out this is a good company and it makes good money so it might be a good investment, so they  buy a bunch of shares too.  if a lot of people are clamoring to buy shares from one company, then the price of each share can go up because people are willing to pay more to get a share in that company.  Now a year later, let's say a lot of people liked Company A and now the price of one share is $2.  At this point, I could say that I want to sell my shares to other people who are willing to buy them for $2, so I get $200 back, which means i made $100 just by leaving the money in there.  The opposite can happen too, maybe people decide this is a lousy company, or maybe the CEO lies about the company earnings and people lose trust in that company, then everybody wants to sell their shares, but since nobody is willing to pay a high price, the price goes down.  so those that are left with shares in that company lose lots of money if they want to sell their shares or if the value of those shares doesn't go back up.  That's basically it.  just rinse and repeat with thousands of companies and groups of companies.  there's a lot to it, but this is just the basic idea.|`|04cb17cc7c7b19d7e182c1f6dad2782eaa	its a place where you can buy or sell stocks!:)|`|ZKeVEmCFaa	If there are more buyers than sellers the price goes up  More sellers than buyers the price goes down.    In times of panic everyone wants out of everything whether good or bad.  In euphoric times no price is too high to pay.
BoAEgaAGaa	You should be eligible for both.  The Child Tax Credit is a credit off your tax liability.  It is worth $1000.  If you have no tax liability or very little you could possibly get the remainder as an Additional Child Tax Credit.      The Earned Income Credit is a credit based on your earned income.  You could qualify for this if you have no children and you are at least 25 years of age but less than 65.  You would have to earn less than $12,880 ($15,880 MFJ).    If you have children you could qualify for up to two children.  The credit is worth up to $4824 depending on the number of children, your filing status, and your earned income or adjusted gross income.  In your case based on $30,000 a year the EIC would be approx. $634 with one child.    There are other qualifications for the EIC.  See page 46 of the Pub 17 linked below for more.    Lastly, you should qualify for both by the information you have provided.    Laura H  H&R Block  Senior Tax Advisor 5   **This advice was prepared based on our understanding of the tax law in effect at the time it was written as it applies to the facts that you provided.|`|AA10469473	Yes it's possible to get both.  They are two separate credits, each with their own rules to be eligible, and from your info it's likely you'd be eligible for both.|`|Run7dyraaa	Sounds like the same thing to me. Not sure though.|`|AA11132354	$2900 and $1000, respectively|`|NuiHXYuOaa	you pay too much tax based on your income.    you have children so you can claim tax back to help with the kids - wage is at a criteria to claim it back.    respectively|`|kZRTekoJaa	they are two different things and depending on your income you may qualify for both.  both links provided will help you determine if you qualify for either but basically, the child tax credit can reduce the federal tax you owe by up to $1,000 for each qualifying child under the age of 17  and the earned income credit is only for people who work and earn under a certain amount.|`|gqmtPx8gaa	Yes you can apply for both. Child tax credit is a standard deduction for any children you have.    Earned Income Credit is an additional tax break for those with children making under a certain amount of money. Be sure to fill out the worksheet to see if you qualify!|`|c24c92b6e2571d7ff8699136760929c3aa	An Earned Income Credit doesn't need a kid, but you get more if you do have a kid.    The Child Tax Credit requires a kid. Yes you can apply for both and make sure to do the worksheet to see if you can ALSO do the Additional Child Tax Credit too.    And don't forget the Child and Dependent Care Expenses stuff too.|`|3y0kYpqnaa	Earned income credit it a credit you get for working, yet you don't make a whole lot of money.  It has to be under a certain amount.  Child Tax credit is the credit you get for having eligible children..meaning you are allowed to claim them as dependents.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	You should be eligible for both.  They are quasi related, but are really two different tax breaks.  The EIC is more based on income earned up to approximately $34,000 and the Child Tax Credit is dependent on the number of kids that you will claim and has a much higher phase out amount.
6sZ1Wyv8aa	I had filed on the 21st and got accepted that same evening and told me it would be DD on the 30th of Jan.  I checked again later then it said 2/3, then today 2/10 and it hasn't moved from 2/10.  The IRS can deposit into your account any time they want but usually have a note to release funds on certain dates and use the estimated 48-72 hr time frame (the reason why 2/3 or 2/10) for your bank to actually get around to releasing the funds...the reason why some people got theirs early is cause their bank released the funds ahead of time instead of waiting.  Im also curious to see if we get our DD on the first date it told me rather than the 2/10 ir says now.|`|J7GTIE5raa	yeah me too. my original date was the 3rd and now the date is the 10th. I believe the IRS computer system is experiencing 'technical difficulties' at this time.|`|JT4OSUPeaa	Mine changed FINALLY!     *phew*    It says it will be DD on 1/30 if I dont receive it by the 4th then I need to call.

I have heard it is because the Recovery Rebate Credit, I have heard it is just a glitch, well as of this morning it is still 10th.  I think they are just picking and choosing and giving us the run around when someone does call.  We all need the money for bills and it is very depressing.  I look forward to this time all year so I can be caught up for a month or so, and even though it is only a weeks difference, the bill collectors dont care what the IRS is doing cause they want their money|`|a5b6eaf1e6e065c5886203f517c6f330aa	Same situation here. Filed mine on the 18th and got accepted within hours after filing! I am really hoping that everyone including myself gets their DD tomorrow as noted on their cycle. This is really frustrating having to check your bank account frequently to see if the money is there.    I guess fridays is not the only day they deposit, ive read on some other posts that they have recieved their money yesterday some even 2 days ago and to top it off I filed before they did!!!!|`|de2a2663fe4b3d02deeeda407aee1db1aa	Thats strange cause the IRS only does direct deposits on Fridays and the 3rd nor the 10th isnt a friday.|`|PB5reDadaa	I think it is going by last name my sisters and her BF are B and C there's said the 23rd now says the 30th my last name is M and now there is no record found and my BF is S and his says the 10th..I think they are updating by last name>|`|12tR5frxaa	Mine did originally say 2/3 then 2/10, but it is the same still...2/10.

Dbj8pU8haa	FUNNNY AS HELL!!!! some of these answers I've read.  Don't ever take advise from someone that is negative about the field you are looking to go into.  One, the only reason they are not positive about your venture is because they have tried and FAILED themselves and two, most aren't cut out for that kind of work anyway.    Now to get to your question:  There are several reasons why this market is ideal for a new career change.  1.  Seniors are a part of the biggest market in are worlds history. (Baby Boomers)  2.  They also have more money than any other single market in history.  3.  And will be more retirees in the next 15 years than any other time in history.  4. The products they NEED are not product other consider to be important ie..Medicare Supplements, Long-Term Care, Cancer and Heart Attack policies and retirement income etc...  5. Higher premiums equal higher commissions  6. Better presistency meaning, they stay on the books longer.  Unlike your Washer and Dryer friend below  whom 15 year ago would have left your butt to save 5 buck a month on his major medical policy.  Senior are less likely to do that unless its a larger savings.   Basically, don't have the time to worry  about who has the lowest premium.    That was just a few examples of why the senior market is great.  I've been selling to seniors for 15 years and believe me, the renewals are great.    Here is what you will need to close deals in the senior market or anything else in sales.    I've been in sales for 15 years and by far I can tell you the Ideal step for closing a sale is not nearly as important as your Attitude about closing a sale.   Prepare your sales attitude daily!    1. Enthusiasm  2. Have a transferable belief system: If you BELIEVE in what you are selling then your customers will BELIEVE in what you are selling and they will buy.  3. Look Good Feel Good  4. Know what you want to achieve for the day and have everything you need to accomplish it.   5. Leave your drunk monkey at home! The little guy on your shoulder that tells you "hey this guy or gal won't buy" "They look too broke" "you'll make no money today" Just give it to a deserving friend and let them live in hell!  6. Have a clear understanding why you do what it is you do.  7. Last but not least, Good or bad, FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOU AND FOR THE VALUE YOU BROUGHT TO YOUR DAY AND TO YOUR CUSTOMERS.|`|7EiWSuPLaa	most senior citizens already have all the insurance they want. if their children want more money when you die, let them get one of those companies on tv. the insurance companies in hartford connecticut, i live in connecticut, are laying off people left and right and another tragedy will likely put them down and out.i'm a senior citizen and both my children took out policies on both me and my wife. do i care? not in the least. but definitely stay away from insurance companies for now. better off you learn a trade, they never lack for work. i mean plumbers and electricians and appliance repair, that's what i did 45years fixing washers and dryers and i don't regret a day of it. the tips didn't suck either|`|YgDO6sxAaa	well if you want an exciting job then no. but if you think this is the right thing for you then go ahead.|`|GjPytA22aa	A better place to focus your efforts is to see about starting your own business.

No matter what anyone says, insurance is a necessity and everyone should have what they need if only to reduce the burden on their survivors. Can you tell a potential client what they need? Can you tell the same client what they don't require, even if they think it's necessary. Will you consider the client's needs before your responsibility to your employers who are justifiabily expecting sales to keep the company afloat. Can you afford to keep yourself afloat in the slow times when the client still needs servicing (servicing doesn't make you money), and you still have expenses to meet so you can't spend too much time servicing.|`|iw7FY4B5aa	Is it really the time to start a career in this economy?|`|dc2aaa32531a0320fa95f4c848a90495aa	What kind of insurance would you "sell to senior citizens"?  I don't know how old you are or how many years you have to work ahead, but if you're considering a job in the insurance field I recommend selling commercial insurance to businesses and/or professionals.  That's where the money is, and the clients appreciate what you do for them.

5Gxll9Hkaa	Yes, they can do that.  Probably they are getting ready to sue you for replevin (repossession) of the vehicle.    USUALLY .... and this is no promise, but USUALLY ... if you are actually caught up with your payments by the time the creditor files suit for replevin, you can USUALLY use that as a defense against the lawsuit and/or convince the company to drop the lawsuit because you are now caught up.    Vehicle lenders are becoming more and more aggressive about suing to repossess the vehicle sooner and sooner in this economic climate, unfortunately.     These days it is critically important not to just "get behind" on car payments.  If a borrower will be unable to make a car payment in full and on time, it is MUCH better to contact the lender and make an alternate arrangement IN ADVANCE than to just "fall behind" in making the payments.

As per the IRS tax refund schedule, the very first Direct Deposit will not be made until Jan 30th for anyone who has filed.      The automated system has been giving out erroneous information and should be disregarded at this point. Here is the schedule http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p2043.pdf    Expect your deposit to be made Jan 30th but if may take until Feb 3rd for your bank to post it.     Best of luck to you.|`|dd3cf2065a180ccacbe77ef40493ab96aa	Your tax refund is scheduled to be direct deposited on January 27, 2009.

I am still waiting and really need it to hit Monday or Tuesday as my rent is due and I am relying on that money to pay it- I know stupid is as stupid does but we just moved and needed some extra cash to get some things for the house and for the utilities to be turned on and we did not want to borrow cash- when they said it would be in on the 30th we counted our unhatched chickens and sent em about into the world to roost- did I mix that metaphor?     At any rate- I think it will be alright by Monday as far as I can tell- I hope so anyhow...    Jenn

9m96dsZIaa	I think you meant that the face value is $1,000, not $10k. The interest rate would be astronomically high if $10k.<br>  <br>  Assuming it is $1,000, here are the answers:<br>  <br>  a. If you paid $902, your implied interest rate is found by solving $902 * (1+i) ^ 3. You'll find that i = 3.5%. In other words, if you invest $902 at 3.5% for 3 years, you'll have $1,000. So by purchasing the note for $902 and collecting $1,000 at maturity is implying that you're getting 3.5% on your money per year. So the difference between your 3.5% rate and the new 1% rate is 2.5%.<br>  <br>  b. If you sell your note tomorrow, the market price will have adjusted so that the new buyer receives 1%. In other words, the price of your note is relatively too low with interest rates at 1%. The market will bid the price higher thus driving down the interest rate. At what point will the bidding stop? When the interest rate is 1%.<br>  <br>  c. The new price is found by x * (1.01) ^ 3 = $1,000. You'll find that x = $970.60. In other words, the market will bid the price of your note to $960, which is the price that makes the yield equal to 1%. If you sell your note now, your capital gain is $68.60, which is the difference between the $902 purchase price and the $970.60 market price.

hYDCgs9Xaa	That's really up to you.  I am assuming you bought your house in 2008.  I myself am a first time homebuyer and we plan on using any credit that we get back (in the form of a tax refund) to apply to our mortgage.  Reason being we have PMI because we didn't put 20% down and we want to get rid of PMI as soon as possible! I agree with the fact that you should make sure you have a good amount of savings (especially in this economy) so I would first make sure you have 2-3 months salary in savings, then pay off credit card (or other high interest) debt, then decide if you should put it towards your house, your car or your student loans.  If it is money you don't need to save then I would pick whicher loan has the highest interest rate! Enjoy.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	It does not work like that.  The credit will be applied to your 2009 tax bill, up to the amount of tax that you owe.  Therefore a) you might not even get the full amount, and b) you are not going to receive an actual check for the credit.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	The first time home buyer benefit is a tax credit, there is a special form to fill out to go with your taxes when you file them. It is not like a check you will receive in the mail.|`|Gun3UGzaaa	It depends on what other debt you might have and the interest rates on those.  For example, if you have a $1,000 credit card balance with a 12% interest rate, pay that first before paying down the car.<br>  <br>  Also, since you are a first time homebuyer, make sure you have at least three months' expenses in a bank account so that you can take care of any surprises with the house without going into debt.  You want to have enough cash on hand so that if something big breaks (water heater, heating system, roof, fence) you can pay to repair or replace it without going into major debt.  As a rule of thumb, you will pay about 1/2 of 1% of the house's purchase price per year in large repairs and appliance replacements.  So, on a $200,000 home, count  on at least one $1,000 repair cost a year.<br>  <br>  Congratulations on buying a house.  Hope it helps the economy.

In this add, I would say that they are trying to sell the idea that their medicine (NyQuil) will make you feel better by alleviating your cold symptoms plus, it has vitamin C in it.  Most of the population knows that vitamin C aids in the body's defense against the cold and flu and other immune system deficiencies. Other benefits may include protection against cardiovascular disease, prenatal health problems, eye disease, and even skin wrinkling.  SO, by adding this nutrient to their product they are making something that is already good, even better.  Who wouldn't want to take an over the counter medicine that will make them feel better when they feel miserable, plus aid in the prevention of them catching the flu or cold again.  This is the age of all things healthy, natural, and just out right good for you.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	It is the convenience of having the Nyquil with Vitamin C always available.

The price is probably the same as regular Nyquil so you would be getting the vitamin C for free.

I've used <a href="http://www.cardlinks.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.cardlinks.net</a> before and got approved. Last time I was there, there were a number of cards that have some fees attached but the fees are applied to the card when you open the account. They will approve you for a "$250 limit" but when you get the card it's charged up to somewhere around $175 -- leaving you only $75 to start with. You will receive periodic credit increases and they will report to your credit. In about 6 months or a year (with timely payments of course) perhaps you could dump the card and get something better.

4RjM5lElaa	The difference is that some employers sign contracts with a particular site - usually one that targets their specific demographic need.  So, if you are wanting HR candidates you might list solely with an HR site like iHireHR.  Monster and similar sites have many of the same employers listing with them.<br>  My personal favorite is CareerBuilder - it's easy to use - narrowing your search is a snap which filters out all positions that area  waste of your time to consider.

2N6oTOLQaa	Roughly speaking, The cardholder agreement that you agreed to when you first got the card allows them to do anything they want. You have the right to pay them or not pay them. If you choose not to pay them, they have the right to sue you and garnish your wages. <br>  <br>  I suggest you contact them and tell them that if they don't lower the interest rate, you are going to transfer the balance to another card with a lower rate. That usually works. If they don't budge, then follow through with your threat. Get a card with a low introductory rate on balance transfers, transfer the balance, and try to pay it off before the introductory rete expires.|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Do you still have a balance? If you were late on a payment they can change the rate. I would call them and say that the increase rate is making it difficult for you to make payments.

They like that!<br>  <br>  If they do not agree, tell them you will continue mailing your payments. Pay it off asap.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	If the card is variable rate, it can change at any time.<br>  <br>  If the card is fixed rate, then they cannot change it to variable (or to a higher fixed rate) without giving you the option to refuse to accept the change.|`|9b9f75545eba3c982f4a21bb3a585952aa	If the account is truly closed, then why do you give a care about what the APR is?

A lot of businesses have their own internal PR departments, or they may hire a PR firm to handle the work.  Public relations is not the same as advertising... PR groups are responsible for managing how a company is depicted in the news, making sure the company has a good public image in the community. That might include press releases about changes at the business, or arranging for an executive to speak at a major industry conference, or coordinating a sponsorship of a community event.

Create the best content you can with the best products you can possibly offer. Your content is your best advertisement - if visitors love your content, then they will go back and spread the word to others.    2. Make it easy for users to recommend your site. Viral marketing is very important -- and easy to tap on the Web. But give your users the tools. Get a Recommend this Site script from websites such as cgiscripts.com and similar directories of scripts. Some even go as far as giving incentives to those who recommend the site to their friends. If only 10 people go to your site, but these 10 people invite 10 more - that's additional traffic that you get for FREE!    AddThis http://www.addthis.com    3. Rank well in the search engines (organic search results, not the pay per click). SEs can be a big source of traffic. The key is to create the best content in your niche. If you have good content, other websites will gladly link to you and offer your site as a resource to their audience. Check the on-page factors and be sure to get linked from authority sites in your topic area.

While outfits charge as much as $650 per release, there are free press release submission places on the Web. Press releases allow you to (a) attract media attention; (b) get more back links to your website without sending each website an email request; and (c) get more visibility especially if your press release gets in Google News or Yahoo News.     http://www.prleap.com/sign_up.html  http://i-newswire.com/  http://www.24-7pressrelease.com/  http://www.pressbox.co.uk/cgi-bin/links/...  http://www.pr.com/press-releases  http://www.prfree.com/  http://www.clickpress.com/releases/index...  http://www.theopenpress.com/  http://www.przoom.com/  http://www.prweb.com  http://www.newswiretoday.com/  http://www.free-press-release.com/    5. Submit articles. Write articles and submit them to websites accepting author submissions. You get exposure for your business; establishes you as an authority in your field, and allows you to get backlinks for your website. If 50 websites publish your article and it contains a link back to your website, then you easily get 50 links from a single article. The more links you have, the greater your chances for increasing your search engine rankings.

4icoqoAbaa	Banks often use a formula of 28% of your income allowed for a mortgage payment. <br>  <br>  Another way to look at it would be your total debt (current debt + new mortgage payment should not = more than 36% of your income.<br>  <br>  So, in your case $6k x 28% = $1680/month.<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  36% of 6k = $2160 so subtract $1000 (current debt) and that leaves you $1160 to be safe.  <br>  <br>  To be smart, you should stick to a budget of the lowest case scenario, i.e. $1160/month.<br>  <br>  You could take some of that 20k you have saved & pay off some debt and you would have more room to play with.|`|AA11173563	you need to be more specific as to these monthly notes as utility bills do not report to your credit file--- but based on what you post about $200,000 loan or could be more<br>  Seek out a loan professional in your state and get pre qualified to buy first<br>  I am a mortgage banker in  TN & KY|`|pOHVhVqgaa	I know I had to have a VOR a verification of rent that my landlord had to sign where they could see how I have been paying.|`|Uc7GM2Rnaa	I would look in the 160-180K range for a house.

arTuC3tKaa	I can tell you definately they will close your account cos that happened to me when I made a claim for a refund of unfair charges with Nationwide.<br>  You should look up one of the consumer forums on the web and open what they call a `parachute account` to fall back on for when they go to cloae your account.<br>  Co operative abnk do an easy to open bank account,<br>  Hope this helps|`|WBkBDbp6aa	The simple answer is no, or at least not yet.<br>  <br>  If you have a valid reason to claim back the charges and you believe they were applied wrongly, then speak to them and if necessary go through their complaints procedure - the worst they can do is say no, they wont close your account. You should continue to keep your account within the agreed limits at all times of course to stop the risk of further charges.<br>  <br>  If this is about charges in general though, and what constitutes a fair charge, there is an open test case at the high court, and you can apply to have all charges for the last 6 years refunded. The downside is that everything is automatically put on hold and nothing will happen until the test case is resolved in court. This has already been running for over a year and there is no immediate end in sight as several major banks are challenged over the fees. If they lose then all the cases on hold will have to pay out. If they pay all the money out they may ask you to close your account then.

They have to satisfy you and you have a right to fight when you feel you have been treated badly or unfairly. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|ZEwAalKPaa	Probably not, though it has been known to happen to people who have consistently overdrawn without prior permission.  If you apply for a refund of charges you will not get it anyway until the current legal test case is settled one way or another.

First tell them that someone else misused the card. Tell them you will pay, but you need some cooperation. You have to pay, sorry.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as debtor's prison. You will not go to jail. It is illegal according to the Fair Debt Collections Practices Act to tell a debtor that they are going to jail. If that did happend, document the call, the name of the collector and time and call an attorney. I doubt they said that, they made statements to shake you up and it worked. If you tell them to not call again, they have to stop. You still owe the money.<br>  <br>  In the future, credit cards are not to be shared.

Not taking into consideration the discount rate your total cash returns with the $10,000 is $14,000 over the nine months. The returns with the $11,480 us $15,500. That only represents $20 more for the initial bigger investment (14k - 10k vs 15.5k - 11.48k).     If you take into consideration the discount rate... lets put in an avg of 2.5% roughly for six months, the extra $1,480 investment should yield you $37.     Hence, you should be getting $37 for the extra investment whilst you will only be receiving rough $20 which is almost double. The first investment is better.

Unfortunatelly, you are not going to like my suggestion, but I think you guys are not ready to buy a house, because, even with money people may not be ready to purchase a home, in your case you can buy a house with student loans that is not the biggest problem the problem becomes your income, if in the event you buy the house he loses his job who will take care of the mortgage, remember that people that the foreclosed on are the ones that have mortgages.      So my suggestion is, start paying off the loans quickly so that you can spare income for savings, save save and save until you have a big savings account and when you have a full time job then think that you want a mortgage that is comfortable for you to pay in the event that he loses his job, or you guys break up or he passes away.  Viceversa he also needs to make sure he can cover the mortgage if you can't.      So you guys want a conventional loan, with a very good down payment enough that you can pay a comfortable mortgage payment and have a life.

So here's what I suggest:    Take a copy of your MPN (the Master Promissory Note you signed to get the student loans) and a copy of your current registration.  There is a part of the MPN (sorry, I don't have a copy or I would tell you what page), where it states that you are in deferment as long as you are at least a part time student.  I would highlight that section, and attach it, along with the registration copy to your home loan application.  If you wish you could also write a brief statement of what your educational goal is and how much longer you anticipate being in college.  With that, and a good credit score, the lender may not use the projected payment on your loans when calculating your debt to income ratio.|`|y2y88JpFaa	WHY do you want to buy a house now?  Prices are falling nationwide so without knowing EXACTLY where you live, where you would buy, what the LOCAL market is doing; I can't see say if that would be a smart INVESTMENT or not but I can give you a few things to consider.    First, you are a student and do NOT have a full time job so the amount of income you have will make it VERY hard to qualify for a decent house in most parts of the country. Second you have not mentioned your boyfriends income, credit, employment stats, odds of you two getting married, time line until you graduate, prospects of employment in that area or if you will move to a different location after school.    Also you have not mentioned how much emergency funds you have saved, how much you have for a down payment, costs of renting versus owning, your experience in buying property, who you have on your team to help you decide what you can afford, what your local market outlook is for population and job growth which has a direct impact on the prices for single family homes, or your time line for owning the property.    Buying a property is one of the BIGGEST investments you will make in your lifetime so doing it on a part time job while in school with the odds of you NEEDING to move within 4 years for employment is not a great idea in a falling market.

AA10464818	It is hard to find grants to start a business, even for handicapped. Unlike the myths that some perpetuate, federal government and even private foundations hardly give grant money for starting a for-profit business.     One possible exception is for companies developing or exporting agricultural goods, including food and forest product. Another exception could be the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) or Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)  programs http://www.sba.gov/aboutsba/sbaprograms/... , which fund the research and development of technological innovation that meets specific government needs.    Your best bet actually will be from the states if they offer grant programs for the handicapped (or any other special interest groups -- minorities, women, women, veterans, etc). Or check with non profit organizations, particularly women organizations if they offer grants. Examples include    Iowa Women's Foundation http://www.iawf.org/  New Mexico Women's Foundation http://www.nmwf.org/guidelines.html    Even SBA does NOT give out grants. From the SBA website http://www.sba.gov/mostrequesteditems/CO...    "The U.S. Small Business Administration does not offer grants to start or expand small businesses, although it does offer a wide variety of loan programs. (See http://www.sba.gov/financing for more information) While SBA does offer some grant programs, these are generally designed to expand and enhance organizations that provide small business management, technical, or financial assistance. These grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments."    Nonetheless, you can go to the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) http://www.cfda.gov and Grants.gov http://www.grants.gov - these are two sites created by the federal government to provide transparency and information on grants. Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.    Here is a listing of federal grants for small businesses. See if there is any available for individuals for starting a business -- THERE'S NONE.  http://12.46.245.173/pls/portal30/CATALO...    Most of the federal grants are given to specific target groups with specific requirements (e.g. minority business owners involved in transportation related contracts emanating from DOT - Grant 20.905 Disadvantaged Business Enterprises Short Term Lending Program     Grants are also often given to non profit groups or organizations involved in training or other similar activities (grant 59.043 Women's Business Ownership Assistance that are given to those who will create women's business center that will train women entrepreneurs

Since I just need a checking and savings account, my priority is convenience and ATM machines. Find one with a branch near you and check it out.    As long as you have less that $100,000, then your account is insured so you don't have to worry too much about the bank closing (except that it would be a major inconvenience). If you have more than $100,000, you will need to put it into multiple banks, so that each is insured. However, if you have more than $100,000, you should be investing the money rather than letting it sit in savings account.
AA11639059	I think it is tempting. The values of currencies are falling all around the world because of the financial crisis.    Consider that the devaluation of the American dollar over the past several years is what contributed to the increase of the price of gold, if for no other reason. Now think that the US government is trying to spend its way out of the current recession. We essentially are inventing money (we used to use the expression "print more money" but now it is an electronic increase). If we enlarge the money supply in an economy and the economy is producing less, the result simply has to be that the value of these dollars will diminish.    Gold (and silver) are not just for monetary store of value. These precious metals are used industrially and commercially. People in China and India and various moslem countries are buying it both for money store and jewelery. The electronics industry is sort of pulling back, but gold and silver are used there for specific properties.    Now if you knew that the value of the money is going to shrink, which would you rather hold, increasingly worth-less currency, or gold that is appreciating in value?    Check out IAU as an efficient way to invest in actual gold. It is shares in a trust that holds physical gold in a vault.

Especially if the dow settles down a bit. Gold will slowly errupt to the 7's.|`|izLEVnKIaa	Gold is banding at the moment between $750 and $950 per oz. Technically it is expensive and a better buying point would be at the $800 mark or near it (currently at $883).    The rationale behind buying gold in the real world (not the Armageddon reasons or metaphorically speaking) is that it is an inflation hedge in that it doesn't lose it's value when currencies lose theirs. Also it is negatively correlated with the USD strength so the idea is that when the Dollar weakens as the world economies begin to right themselves it should increase in value.    The counter argument is that gold has been overvalued as a safe haven during the flight to safety (along with the dollar and Yen) and when the world rights it's self then gold will sell off. Also, the Breakeven rate on US inflation protected bonds is indicating a period of Deflation which would again cause gold to devalue.    Personally i believe the potential downsides of gold weigh just as heavily as the upsides and advise my clients that if they are looking for stability and diversification then it's good, if you want to make money from it - there's much better stuff out there. So if you are a multi millionaire looking to diversify away some of your currency risk then i think it would be a good buy; if you are not then don't bother, oil is much better for upside potential.|`|a0b943926ff31dc5ae164f5e71cd6efaaa	not to be harsh, but if someone told u to jump out the window, would u consider doing it?    first rule of investing is to understand what your buying and WHY youre buying it, after all its YOUR hard earned money. do lots of homework beforehand.|`|hVuDF91Caa	ABX is a large company, secure, and a conservative play on Gold.
9Wi2eNInaa	Rush's whole game is that democrats and/or liberals are responsible for every problem that mankind experiences.<br>  <br>  He picked 1999 because then he can blame Clinton for the mess we are in instead of Bush. <br>  <br>  I'm 55 yrs old and non-denominational in religion and politics and I have never ever experienced the disaster that I believe Bush has created. He is the worst president imaginable. Every president before him I was able to find some good in them and eventually say "he wasn't too bad" and I say that about Nixon, Johnston, Carter and all of them since.<br>  <br>  If Rush was to dig out another article from the year 2004, he would see that the Federal Reserve allowed banks to up their asset/liability ratio from 1:8 dollars all the way to 1: 40 dollars.<br>  Why did the Feds allow the banks to loan 40 dollars for every 1 dollar in assets they held? Because according to them real estate has never experienced a significant downturn in value and even if some of these loans were to become defaulted the constantly increasing value of the held real estate would guarantee the loan. So these banks put up all these easy to sell loans and sold them as bonds to investors as MBS's (mortgage backed securities) with interest rates at 8-10 % with the appearance of total safety. <br>  <br>  But when these loans started to default and the banks and service companies couldn't sell the properties for more than they loaned on them that's when the whole thing started to collapse. But you also have to throw jobs and OIL into the equation. <br>  <br>  With no one in the whitehouse objecting to oil price increases and just using the excuse of supply and demand (which was never true, because in supply and demand it implies you don't have supply so price must go up, yet at no time was there waiting lines or allocation of fuel) Oil went to prices never ever seen before. People were putting their fuel bills on their credit cards and $200 a month was going overseas from each driver and making our balance of trade turn so very sour. With the price of oil going crazy every product and commodity coming from oil went up exponentially also. Far more money was leaving this country than coming into it. This made the value of our dollar drop like a rock. With the value of the dollar down, nobody wanted to buy our bonds, so we couldn't finance our government debts, so the only way to get money is to print it...with inflation and import /export ratio so high, a crash was a brewing<br>  <br>  Since oil was so high in other countries they all had to borrow to pay their oil bills also so all this money was flowing out from around the world into a few oil producing countries and no leadership from United States to set some pricing standards led to what we have now.<br>  <br>  For an economy to prosper you have to export more than you import and you have to have jobs for people to buy things to support domestic demand. <br>  <br>  From 1990 to 2000 computers and software saved this country. These computers and software were sold around the world and made everybody's factories and offices more productive. When Bush got in he started a few wars thinking that spending would keep the economy flowing, but you can't make money with a war unless you steal someones elses sh*t. From 2000 to 2003 the economy tanked and there was no hope. When the Fed ok'd that asset /liability ratio to go up now the banks loaned out all that money to build houses. So all the companies that benefited from construction and supplies went nuts with this borrowed money.<br>  <br>  So we basically tried to build an economy on "You build me a house, and then I'll sell it to you for a higher price and then you sell it to me for a even higher price" . A gigantic Ponzi scheme completely orchestrated by our government. I think they knew it would fail but they thought they would be out of office by the time it happened.

They could end up doing substandard work. Your insurance rates should not go up because the accident was not your fault. Your front end damage (the hood not opening) could be attributed to hitting the freeway wall. Did you get the other party's insurance information? File with them. If you file with your company what will happen is that they will pay your damage less your deductible and then go after the other party for the full amount including your deductible. Once they collect they will send you your deductible.     Your rates can only increase if the accident is chargeable to you. If you had damaged the other party's vehicle when you hit it, then your company would have to pay for her damage.|`|kYYDOJzSaa	1)  If they rear-ended you, it is 100% their fault.    2) NEVER move your vehicle until you get the police there (people love to change their stories).    3) Call your insurance, explain what happened, and get your car fixed, or replaced by the responsible party.    Good luck - if this ever happens again - call the police, and do not move your car.

8b0ff26bd768031b646ac62be8cba69aaa	Totally depends on when you got laid off.  Although the loan is due and payable when you terminate it doesn't actually go into default status until the end of the quarter following the quarter in which you fail to make a payment.  So, to answer your question...if you got laid off after 7/1 then this is a 2009 default and you don't put anything on your taxes.  If you were laid off prior to 7/1 then you should get a 1099-R and it's treated as a distribution and put on page 1 of 1040.  The corresponding 10% penalty is applied in the "other taxes" section on page 2 of the 1040.    If you don't get the 1099-R that means they didn't default it yet and you shouldn't say a word to your employer.  Without the 1099-R the IRS doesn't know a thing.|`|hA0QBgDCaa	You will get a 1099 R form showing the amount of the unpaid balance.

gHzQdp6Xaa	From a legal standpoint- life insurance can not be accessed by creditos-regardless if you are marrier or not.

They are only allowed to tell your inquiring party the dates that you worked, how much your wages were, and in most cases if you are up for rehire. If you put in your two weeks, and you worked them - and you quit, they have to tell that you are eligible.     That being said, usually according to the documentation of employee handbooks is according to how long something can be left on someone's file. It could be a month, 6, or a year.    The first thing that you always need to do is make sure that you are up on company policy. I've had companies revise their handbooks, and then tell me that something was policy long after I had quit. Make sure you know the rules.    IF you really feel that you were mistreated or written up, or warned for something petty, I would also keep documentation at home about the situations at work. It could always help in an unemployment claim, if it ever came to that.    Hope this helps.

wQJBFcluaa	People are saying they have actually talked to someone at the IRS and they say it is a glitch.1/30 is when the IRS has stated they will begin making direct deposits.I would start checking with your bank on 1/30.Depending on your banks policy of making direct deposits available it could be 2 or 3 days more at the most before it's available.I used H & R Block's Taxcut online and chose to pay my fees with H & R Blocks SimplePay.From the info I have gathered that is going to cause a 1-2 day delay because first the IRS sends my refund to H& R Block Bank and they deduct their fees and then they forward it to my bank.Fortunately my bank's policy is to make direct deposits available the day they get them.So if the IRS does  send my DD 1/30 to H & R I should get it by 2/3.Good luck,hope you get it soon.|`|2N6oTOLQaa	How many times are you going to ask the same question before you realize that the IRS does not have a phone number you can call and just get your questions answered.

U0vr7T6laa	Yes-  the IRS has many auditors in the office and in the field to make sure the taxes are proper.  In addition, the  IRS service centers or campuses match income with the amounts reported to them with the tax returns.  There are penalties when people cheat on their taxes.  Most penalties are civil. Sometimes there are also criminal penalties.  Ask Richard Hatch ?  from the Survivor TV show who failed to report his income taxes.  He was convicted of tax evasion and is now serving time   ( I think).  The "famous people"  make the news.

I agree with you that the market is undervalued, but it will not stop the panic of the ignorant.<br>  <br>  There has been no real value created since the internet in the US.<br>  The investments in Biotech firms and Alternative Energy firm in the US have yet to produce profits.<br>  There has been no real wealth created by the Baby Boomers who were simply destroyers, depleters and super consumers.<br>  The rebuilding of the America falls onto those born 1960 and later.  These were the folks saddled with the debts of the Boomers and the busted world they are turning over.  <br>  As said above, the $10,000 charged for the pencil is not going to be paid. So values of companies are still make believe.<br>  Worse of all, banks receiving taxpayer money are still further destroying the purchasing power of the consumer by attacking both the incomes and credit ratings of consumers.<br>  <br>  There is stilll way too much bad news to come out and have the mandatory over-reaction.

0lCnu1g2aa	What a great plan. If your in highschool, and I am assuming you are, take lots of science and math to at least algebra I or 2. For science you will need chemistry and biology for sure, and if there is a human anatomy class that would give you a head start. You should also consider taking psychology and sociology as well.     When is comes time to pick a school, talk to nurses in your area and see where they went to school. I would also ask about pass fail rates on boards. I would start applying to schools at the end of junior year or begining of senior year that you are interested in. Apply to several in your area as nursing school is very competitive to enter.

No insurance company will offer a policy to anyone already pregnant even if the policy doesn't have maternity benefits in most states.<br>  <br>  As far as the co-insurance - you need to check what is the out-of-pocket maximum and how much you'll be out should you have a catastrophic occurance. You may find that a policy with a deductible would be better for you. You'll still get the doctor visits without meeting the deductible. For example; if you have a policy with a $1000 deductible and $3000 co-insurance you'll be out a total of $4000, which is less than if the Aetna policy has a $7500 maximum.

You can't do anything to make him responsible for his half.|`|AA11284831	Any debt from a prior year joint return is owed by both of you.  Both of you will have your refunds offset for any debt until it's paid in full.  If acceptable payment arrangements are not made, the IRS will proceed against BOTH of you for forcible collection of the debt.    The only way that you can make him responsible for it is to get a court order to that affect and then sue him if he does not compensate you for whatever the IRS collects from you.  The IRS has no dog in this fight and will NOT honor a state court order that divides up the debt.|`|F4rD4HF0aa	if u file single then it's ur money u get back not his.

Ag8pE3Cyaa	Worldgirl has a good advice. I would like to add don't make your resume too long with unnecessary details of jobs not related to clerical tasks. I get so many resumes for accounting positions and people are  giving me pages of tasks they've accomplished as swimming instructor!    It doesn't matter if you're shy, I prefer a shy person then an arrogant or too confident person to work for me. Smile a lot and don't go there all defeated, people can sense that.     Do not talk about the fact you damaged your knees. Clerical work does not need for physical work, once again unnecessary information you should keep to yourself.     Maybe you're aiming for a too prestigious position. If you're shy don't apply for a job that requires you to prepare meetings, phone people, welcome guests. Aim at a job in data/order entry, accounting clerck etc.|`|xddzLnLPaa	You can be shy and still be a good communicator. Rehearse interview questions with friends; practice steady eye contact and giving simple, direct answers.    As for making your resume stand out, here are two tips:    Always, always write a cover letter that's tailored to the company you're applying for, NOT a generic one. You don't have to redo the whole thing, just change a few sentences and you're good to go.    If you're creative and have some graphic design skills, create a resume that's not your average Word doc. Don't make it too fancy, but add a personal logo or a nice font and you'll automatically stand out in the stack.    Good luck!
WYjbuu6saa	RECESSION.    Good question.  I can't find a job either - been looking for two years now.|`|aHmAZeoqaa	What is your degree in and what level is it (associate/bachelor/certificate)?|`|fGqkfLZQaa	Hello, I know this is discouraging, but you have a degree and the market is more flexible in terms of what degrees have been historically assigned to varied positions.  There is some lucky employer waiting for you to see their ad and apply!    Make sure you highlight your degree - that alone demonstrates perseverance as well as intellect.    Spin the experience you do have, and tailor the verbiage around your past jobs to demonstrate compatibility or transferable skills.    Hope this helps

z3TIcyI6aa	Ok, he should be getting DLA for a start which would help with his income. That is paid to any person with an eligible disability regardless of working or not.     Incapacity for *new* claims is now Employment support allowance (ESA)    Which focuses on things people can do and not what they can't.  So he might be able to go ahead and claim that because they focus more on disabled people and give far more support rather than the normal JSA. But he still might be able to get JSA. I would phone the Job centre and ask, which is best to claim as it would be down to how much he can see.  David Blunket is after all blind but I know he has a lot of support staff in place.     There are probably jobs he could do but I can't think of any at the moment :0)  Does he not have any support or groups?

sI3krJULaa	You have to pay state tax to whatever state you worked in if they have an income tax.  If you worked in VA for any part of 2008, then you'll have to file and pay VA taxes.  You're free and clear on any income earned in FL, since that's one of the 7 states that don't have any sort of income tax.    Hope that helps. :0)|`|BoAEgaAGaa	Florida does not have a personal income tax so you have no Florida return to file.      Part-Year VA residents are required to file if they receive any income from VA sources and meet the gross income test of $11,250 for single or MFS, or $22,500 if MFJ.  Even if you do not meet this test you would still want to file to possibly receive a refund of your VA state tax withheld.  Did they keep on withholding the rest of the year?  Then you definitely need to file the VA return.    You could seek a good tax professional to help you with the VA return.

NsbGM74iaa	If he pays the $100 a month on time every week like he's supposed to, then it will not go into arrearage and the IRS will only take out $700.    Worse comes to worse, they take out $1100 by mistake and he just wont pay child support for one month to make up for it.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	This is quite simple to deal with.  Wait until the arrears are garnished from his tax return. Determine if he was garnished correctly, too much, or too little. As soon as you have the payment from the IRS, write a letter:  I, Jane doe, hearby state that the recent garnishment paid to me by the IRS was overpaid by $400. I will refund this money, by certified check to John Doe. Copy attached. John Doe acknowledges receipt of this check.  Signed  Jane Doe   John Doe    Then go to the bank, together, get the check, and have 2 0f  document notarized by the bank.|`|T1kRNoxCaa	And you are complaining why?

He is the one who has to call.|`|49d74bd8b100117274d25e31b1942932aa	OK, they did that to my ex too -  the thing is -  he will just be ahead in child support - its not like you get "extra money" -  if by chance he gets behind again - he won't be behind because they have this money as a backup.  and, there is a way to correct it - and its not just if he loses his jobs.    Such as,    just in this year,  I am suppose to be getting money every 2 weeks from my ex -  there are times they don't send it?  WHY?  I don't know -  work forgets?   I am also going through the c.s office. so, i wouldn't worry about it.it will eventually play out right in the end.    My ex had a "credit" and now he is actually behind because of 2 payments in this year failing to arrive for some reason or another.

I would say that a one bedroom at 560 sq. ft. left in decent shape can be completed in absolutely no more than 5 business days. Of course, you have to stay on your workers to make sure they are staying on schedule and have carpet/cleaning scheduled accordingly.<br>  <br>  I would schedule something similar to this:<br>  <br>  Painters - allow 2 full business days for decent size 1 bedroom <br>  (depending on how many painters there are)<br>  General maintenance - allow 1 business day<br>  Carpet/Vinyl layer - 1/2 business day<br>  Cleaning - 1/2 - 1 business day<br>  <br>  Never a good idea to have too many people working in one apartment at the same time.<br>  <br>  Things that would slow you down would be conflicts in scheduling, finding more problems such as mold, leaks or etc.

UVOQWLT7aa	well, you really should use it to pay the hospital bill, but the check is in your name do what you want.|`|OTex8cv5aa	Well, as with most indigent people and people with very little money, I believe that YOU believe YOU are entitled to this money.    However, it is morally and socially correct for you to hand over the entire sum to the hospital that provided you with health care.      Arranging for a payment plan will only add to the already large debt you probably carry.  And if you have no monetary prospects, the hospital may never get their money and you'll have to come up with lies as to why you can't pay.  Plus, the other bills you mentioned, need addressed by you, NOT the insurance company.    Maybe you can go slip-n-fall over at your local Wal-Mart and pay off all your bills.|`|obXAeNW5aa	unless the check is made out to the hospital then u can use it any way u want .|`|sj3Bq7vEaa	You can use the check for whatever you want. Ideally, use it to pay off your bill. If you make a payment arrangement in these kind of economic times and then lose your job later...then you'll be stuck with that bill.    Do you have medical payments coverage on your own auto policy? They'll pay your medical bill for this car accident.    Otherwise, I would tell the hospital you can pay it in full for a lesser amount, to try and haggle with them. Offer 1/2 first and settle for about 3/4 to 80% of it.
Pjm9pg7iaa	Yes, i think it would increase the hits. I have always used Oodle as a search site by itself. I go to it when i am looking for cars or tickets. Since i always add the city name before typing Oodle, i always know where i am shopping anyway so the ads don't have to say the city or state..

AA11598210	~~To my knowledge and the last I read about it, it is taking 6 to 8 weeks before you are entered into the system and automation on your check takes place. This is because of the tremendous backlog of claims they are handling.    It's quite a mess, and you'll see many people here experiencing the same problem. Only thing you can do is what you are already doing. Maybe speaking to all your creditors and explaining the situation will help you get more time on your payments to them. Many are trying to help people in your situation.    Such a mess in were in, and the job market is just horrible. I wish you the best of luck!~~

AA11065140	Jane is right.  Yes, it's legal, because it's what you have instructed your employer to do.    Besides that - did you really go the whole year without looking at your pay stub?  Did you seriously not realize that there was so little being withheld?  It's your responsibility to be sure that your taxes are being processed appropriately.    Don't stress out about having a bill.  They'll gladly help you find a payment plan that can work for you.    Edit:  The state pulls your tax rates from the same W4 that the Feds use (they have different rates than the Feds, but they use the same form to figure your withholding).  It sounds to me as if you need to decrease the number of dependents on your W4, so that they'll be pulling more on a regular basis.  Alternately, there's usually a box to check, that allows you to have an additional flat rate pulled from each paycheck just for the state.  I believe I've adjusted mine to have the state take an additional $5 per check, because otherwise, the withholding is too low.  I don't want to change the number of dependents, because this would effect my federal taxes, so I use this to offset the percentage differences.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	They withhold what you tell them to on the W-4 you filled out. Check with your employer to see what you listed on it. You may want to up how much they take out for the future.

You can be taken to court by your landlord if you do (which is like adding insult to injury). <br>  <br>  You can submit your repair bill (or documented letters requesting repair and the landlords actions) and request reimbursement. If he will not reimburse, submit the same to the water company. I know our public utility will reevaluate utility bills if you can prove there was a problem and that it was repaired.<br>  <br>  If a credit shows up on the water bill (you didn't say whether you get a copy of the bill or not or if it comes directly to you) than you are entitled to that refund.  If the bill is sent directly to you, you will get the credit (ie if the bill is in your name). Problem solved.<br>  <br>  If the landlord gets the credit and doesn't pass it on to you, you can threaten to take them to landlord/tenant court.  It's free except for the paperwork filing cost (in our state it's very minimal $10-$40). The judge will more than likely rule in your favor.|`|AA11910058	That depends on if the plumbing problem was due to faulty or worn out plumbing that existed prior to your moving in.  If the landlord wants to keep your rent payments coming, he would not only fix the leak, but pay the difference in the water bill if you had no way of knowing the water was leaking.  However, if you knew that the toilet was running and didn't notify the landlord, he has no obligation to reimburse you for your negligence.  Your best bet is to pay the bill and keep records, then tell the landlord what the problem is and ask him for  the difference.  If he refuses, your next step should be to contact the state's attorney general's office and ask for their advice.  Usually a letter from that office to your landlord will do the trick.  If you were the innocent party here, you should be made whole by the landlord.  Last resort would be small claims court.  Don't threaten to withhold the rent, because then you start a pissing contest that the landlord will likely win.|`|yf0tevyfaa	Landlords have the obligation to make sure that the spaces they rent out are livable. If there's a problem with plumbing or electric, it is their duty to make sure all things like that are in working order. I think he should have to pay for it, especially if you've let him know about it but he hasn't fixed it yet.<br>  <br>  If he doesn't give, then you might have to take him to a small claims court.<br>  <br>  I saw a case on the news where these people had an apartment and the plumbing pipes were so old that their apartment flooded. The landlord refused to pay the cost of water damage and they had to take him to court to get him to pay.|`|Uc7GM2Rnaa	Dear...   a leaky toilet that triples a water bill makes noise.   <br>  <br>  Did you hear it?

Hello he owns it!|`|gXuUmq7qaa	If in your lease it states that you are responsible for utilities, you are responsible for utilities, plain and simple.  Regardless of whether or not you informed your landlord of the issue, or if he was negligent in getting it fixed immediately, unless you and he agreed otherwise, in writing, that you could deduct some of this bill, it's your bill.  There are other actions you could have taken, even if he didn't get it fixed right away, such as, like one person pointed out, turning off the water at the source.  Sure, it doesn't seem fair, and you certainly could go to small claims court over it, but who knows if you would win, and ultimately it could impact your relationship with the landlord - when your lease comes due, he may remember this and decide not renew you, which is within his rights.  It wouldn't hurt to tell the landlord about the bill and just see if he offers to pay some share of it, but if he doesn't, you're probably better off just sucking it up and paying it.  Technically, it's your responsibility anyway.|`|AA11481282	I am a renter as well. And we had a leaky toilet too. But i had been slacking in the "alert" department and didn't have time to alert my landlord to the problem, it took me about a month to let them know. So I didn't see the need to charge them for my high bill.<br>  <br>  But I think if you notified them right away when it started and it took them a long time to address the problem, then yes you should write them a letter alerting them why your rent check is less. <br>  <br>  Not your fault they aren't on top of things.|`|xCifmFfkaa	I wouldn't ask-- I'd send him a bill for the difference.<br>  <br>  Especially if you had specifically expressed your concern (ie., the toilet was leaking) and he failed to fix it.<br>  <br>  Either way, I would think that he could be held liable since it is technically his property, he is not keeping up with maintenence.

If you deduct the difference in next months rent, you will likely find yourself being sued and loosing, and/or being evicted. <br>  <br>  You are wrong when you say water is usually included in rent. It is sometimes included but each lease is different and its perfectly normal for a landlord to make you pay your own utilities bills. In fact, the only situations where water is included in rent is in multi-unit buildings where there is not a separate water meter for each unit. Even then, tenants sometimes have to split the amount of the water bill between the units that use the water.|`|RZzMse3Haa	NO! Although it would be fair it would not be legal.  The landlord is not legally required to pay any part of your water bill in the event of a leak.<br>  <br>  also - they are not being unfair by having you pay your own utilities.

For example, a working family who have dependents and have high rent costs could get a nice refund.  I've heard of it being as high as $1430.00.  A low income family with government subsidized housing will get a lot less.  I did taxes last year for a woman who worked part time, lived in subsidized housing, with one dependent and her Rent Refund was only around $130.00.   <br>  <br>  Renters get a CRP (Certificate of Rent Paid) from their landlord and use that to file an M1PR form.<br>  <br>  The Rent Refund is not combined with your State Refund, they usually send them out starting August 15th, in alphabetical order.  Last year they were sent out even earlier.<br>  <br>  My husband is a college student and we don't get taxed on any grants, loans or scholarships.  Not sure but it might be because of our income and dependents.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helped.

I, like many wanted to know whether this was just another re-hashed product or something new.  Last year Jonny created the Money Siphon System which was a well reviewed and well received program - he assures me that this is totally different. That was aimed at people wanting to earn money from affiliate marketing. This system is the same as he uses to generate a lot of money every year. He claims that the four video and ebook modules he's publishing will guide you right through to a finished business that will earn many, many thousands - the same as his.  For a cheap opening price its probably worth having a go. If it was $1000 I would need more convincing - at $77 its not such a big deal.

mCxhX9tMaa	The idea may have potential.  I see some pros and cons.    Pros:   It is a pretty original idea.  Not a lot of competition.  Could be very fun to put together.  Likely to have a good percentage of repeat business.  Doesn't require a lot of manpower.  Low overhead.    Cons:  Would require a lot of advertising to reach your market.  Since it is an unusual business, people won't look for you, you have to find them.  Unless you focus on a very high end market, the fees that you could charge are fairly low, requiring a very high volume to succeed.  Requires extensive knowledge of the establishments in your area.    It sounds like you have an interesting idea.  Now it is time to do some research.  Figure out how much you can charge each customer.  How much time you would have to put into each customer.  Figure out what your expenses (including paying yourself) would be.  How many customers would you need to serve in order for it to work?  Talk to a few people.  Would they pay that much?  If so, you may be onto something good.|`|CCYWYk3qaa	interesting concept..give it a shot!|`|NfSLXHU3aa	I like the idea, but you don't need to stick with just first dates.

I could call you and say I'm going to be in XYZ city and I want to go to a Chinese restaurant serving Paper wrapped chicken in the downtown district.    I could go online and do the work myself, but how much easier it would be to pay you $5 or so and receive an email telling me the location of 1 or 2 places with directions, menu prices and parking.    You could have 2 websites, one for daters and one for travelers.
gWSrybONaa	Because he is actually your brother and you said that he did live with you, which would mean that you provided more than half support for him I would think that you could file him. The only this is that he would have needed to be with you for more than half the year (at least like 183-184 days just to be safe) and his school would have to have your address on file. The only way you would get audited is if they found something wrong with your return and then needed to examine it. Then you have to provide proof that he is indeed you brother, that he stayed with you more than half the year, that provided more than half his support.

I cannot tell from your question but it does  seem unlikely that he would qualify as your dependent, and  even if he did, I'm not sure how much benefit it would be. If  you are still a dependent, then you yourself cannot claim a  dependent.

To get even better tax breaks, consider participating in a Health Care Flexible Spending Account if your employer offers one.|`|sI3krJULaa	Taxes are on a cash basis- that means that you take deductions and claim income in the year in which you actually handed over the cash or received the cash.      On a second note, medical expenses are only deductible over 7.5% of AGI, and only if you itemize.  So, if you only paid a percent and insurance covered the rest, you may not even be eligible for the deduction at all.  For example, if your adjusted gross income was $40,000, you'd have to itemize and have over $3,000 worth of medical expenses.  Only the amount over the $3,000 would be deductible.    When I do individual returns, people always give me their medical information.  9 times out of 10, I can't use it.    Good luck. :0)

4gMdp2nwaa	Overall I would not buy long term treasury mutual funds. In fact I would go the opposite way. Short term interest rates are very low indeed because the government wants to stimulate the economy, but with the injection of capital from the government there is a real chance of inflation within the next year - perhaps not over three months but it is a possibility. I wouldn't buy treasuries in this uncertain economic climate. I would sit on cash or buy a short term CD|`|h9cEGYO4aa	No.    The next bubble to pop is in treasury bonds.  They will not go bust, but the current price of the long bonds are sky high.  This high price is temporary when compared to the 10-20 year average maturity of most long term treasury mutual funds.  People who are buying long term treasury funds will get killed, the only way they will win at these rates are if we have long term deflation, we may have short term deflation but with all of the action taken by the fed and our government inflation will be the longer term problem.  If we get long term deflation we are in a world of hurt.|`|uVuCx3taaa	Can't say for sure, but my broker told me to stay away from long term and to go with short term only, as inflation should be back with a vengeance in a year or two.

If you don't you'll eventually get a letter from the IRS assessing not only the extra tax, but also interest and penalties.|`|paerqxfMaa	Just filed an amended return (1040X) - the IRS knows about the $1000. because they get all the information on each social security number.  They owe you money - make sure you get your full refund.
NwkZ5OmCaa	It's not a percentage.  It's based on actual meals or per diem--but you need to prove you were out of town.  Ditto for miles, you need the mileage logs.
blwGSJg7aa	First of all the only reason you received your refund last year even after you received the letter stating your refund could be offset is by law a collection agency has to give you time to react to the letter stating they intend to offset your return, and depending on the company it could be between 90-180 days from the date of the letter.      Now everyone I really don't know if this is what you will want to hear but this is what will happen to your refund if you have an offset pending, and I know because it happened to me last year!      I had a student loan from years ago that had been sent to a collection agency, well the collection agency sent a request to the IRS for my refund to be intercepted (Offset) last year for the entire balance of my student loan in default and the total at that time was $5,267.39.      Then the IRS Offset my entire refund of $2,030.00 and sent it to the collection agency, which in turn sent the payment to the people that guranteed my student loan, so I DID NOT GET A SINGLE PENNY OF MY REFUND, but it did reduce my balance owed to my student loan by $2,030.00.      Now with that being said here's how you will know for sure if your refund will be "Offset" or not?      Call "FMS" at 1-800-304-3107 and it will prompt you to the point where you can enter your "SSN" and if the recording comes back with a name and phone number of an agency that has requested an offset of YOUR refund, then your refund has been flagged and WILL BE OFFSET by the entire amount requested!!!      Now if you owe less than your refund, you will receive the difference, but if you owe more than your refund then you will NOT receive anything but a letter from the IRS stating your refund was offset and to what company!      Also to answer the question the person had that filed their return on Jan22, I know you say that you called "FMS" and was told that your refund was flagged, well I hate to tell you but that means your NOT getting a refund, and the reason I say this is you said when you called the person you talked to tried to set up a payment plan, now this tells me you owe more than your refund, so that means you will not get back a single dime!      Furthermore the reason the guy in charge of your account couldn't tell you exactly what they will be taking out of your refund is he don't know if you have more than 1 offset on your refund or not, but if you only have the single offset with his company then you can take the balance he gave you on your account, then subtract your entire refund and that will give you your net balance?      (Anyone else that may be reading this then that will leave you with a positive balance meaning you'll get back what's left over from your refund, or a negative balance meaning you'll still need to make payments until paid in full)      In closing there are a few things most of you can do in order to keep your refund from being offset?      1. DON'T FILE YOUR RETURN UNTIL YOU ENROLL IN A LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM!!!      2.  People don't say you can't afford to make payments because what you really CAN'T afford is to lose your entire refund!!!    3.  If you call the number listed above and it tells you that your refund will be offset then it will give you what company and their number that has requested an offset of your refund an in order to stop this you MUST call them and tell them you would like to enroll in a "Student Loan Rehabilitation Program" and if you qualify after as few as 4-6 small payments your offset will be lifted provided you continue with your timely payment, but if you have already filed your refund then it's to late!!!    4.  However if you wait till April 15th to file your return and have enrolled in a loan repayment program, then if your refund is offset then you have a great chance to receive a refund, and I know because even though I lost my entire tax refund of $2,030.00 to my student loan, when it was time to get my stimulus payment of $900 that was intercepted (offset) too, however it was refunded to me since I was in a loan repayment program!    I HOPE THIS HELP YOU ALL???? :)|`|4ZNl4V3Oaa	Plan on the offset.  If it's less than your total refund amount you should receive the balance 2 to 4 weeks after the offset is processed.|`|jOYDj3nIaa	i dunno but im lik in da same predicament as u...they caught up wit me too..i havent got a letta, but they want 2 garnish my paycheck now..unless i pay 141.00 by january 26th umm it past that date and i dont have 2 quarters to rub 2getha...the lady did tell me they havent got income taxes this year but they should next year.

You will receive the rest if your refund is for more than you owe on the Student Loan.|`|324b3f4848cd87a162532046683c0c35aa	The " 2008 Stimulus" was a loan against your 2008 refund. When you filed in 2008, if you filed Married filing joint, you recieved the maximum of $1,200.00 (single or head of household $600.00) as your stimulus payment. In round numbers lets say your getting $2,400 as your 2008 refund, you'll only be refunded $1,200.00 for 2008!     A direct quote from H&R Block sight  "Digits Community"  "What the tax rebate wasnt   The tax rebate payment was not interest, it was not income, it was not a dividend. Pure and simple, the tax rebate payment was an advance credit for tax year 2008 and it will be calculated on your 2008 return when you file."|`|KKaeRztMaa	Well I am definately in the same boat as you and can't wait to at least hear how yours turned out.  I am absolutely sick at my stomach waiting and wondering.  Especially since the house that we were renting burned completely to the ground in November and of course any extra help we can get right now is fantastic.  I called the 1-800   last year and had nothing listed.  This time (well) today I called after filing 3 days ago and they said I had defaulted loan and that "it may" be taken out of my income tax return.  I did my taxes on turbo tax and my refund is due in our account on the 6th.  It is driving me crazy not knowing anything.  I never received a letter or anything.      Good luck to you.

They will ask you to get a repair estimate from at least 2 repairers. Unless you dropped it down the stairs dropping your pc is unlikely to have caused major damage and possibly it could just be a pci card, ram stick or cable jerked loose.|`|Svanlzg7aa	You dropped your own PC. Having worked in insurance, they don't pay out when you drop your own stuff. However, if you have a child under the age of 13, and the child damages something, say knocks over your TV, you are covered less your deductible. But in this case, don't be surprised if they tell you you are not covered.|`|tlgJrKoRaa	Check your policy first then ring and ask for a claim form|`|I3CNklLKaa	If you have accidental cover it will be covered except for any uninsured excess (which will be specifiied in the policy).

Take no notice of the lady above - I'm sure she means well but it doesn't matter if you drop it yourself, it's still covered.|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	Check your policy wordings first before making a claim. This type of damage may or may not be covered. If unsure contact the broker/agent who you purchased the policy from to confirm if there is coverage. If there is coverage then someone will come out to inspect the PC and will probably ask that you take it to a repair facility to check how much it would cost to repair. If the repair cost is less than the replacement cost then the insurer will pay to repair your current PC, less your deductible (excess).|`|ewswVOrTaa	Phone them up and tell them what has happened.  They may ask you to get estimates, but each case varies.  I believe Norwich Union don't pay out cash for this type of claim, they will deliver a new PC if it is beyond economical repair.    I hope you have accidental damage on your insurance or you won't be covered.|`|zkj9uhlMaa	Hi the only problem with making a claim on the insurance is thay you will have to pay say the first 150 or so to get it fixed so check your policy for your excess.

HJT3KIPOaa	Title 26 section 1 of US law imposes a tax on individual income (yours).    Title 26 section 7203 makes willful failure to pay tax a crime, punishable by up to 1 year in prison or $25,000 fine for each offense. Other penalties may apply, depending on the circumstances.    Every argument that you have read against these laws has been rejected in court, often several times. If you go into a court making the same arguments (or "slightly different" arguments), you WILL lose. If you lie low and hope the IRS won't notice, then you're just racking up interest until they finally get around to prosecuting you.    One answer mentions Tommy Cryer. The court rejected all of Cryer's arguments against the tax code. (As I said, courts ALWAYS reject those arguments.) However, he avoided prison by convincing the jury that he was truly ignorant of the tax laws and that his violations were not willful. He still has to pay back taxes with penalties and interest.    Prison is no fun at all. Follow the tax laws.|`|9a881112567263b20d6262238853cc86aa	The Constitution gives Congress broad authority on what they can tax.

That's it.|`|mMPZuR7taa	Consult a lawyer.|`|sj3Bq7vEaa	The first answer is correct. You have to be able to prove the other person is at-fault, just like in court. So, if they can't verify what happened with their insured (the person responsible for your damage), they can't accept liability. Was there a police report or an independent witness? Sometimes they'll use this instead after they've tried to reach their insured for about a month or so. They're not required to, but it's a possibility.    Did their insured give you any of his contact info? Did you verify that the insurance company has this same information? Many times this situation happens when someone moves or changes their phone numbers, but they don't notify their insurance company, so the contact info. they have on file for their insured is wrong when they get a new claim.     You also could try calling the other person yourself and explain  (politely, of course) that you know he's busy, but you really want your vehicle taken care of ASAP, so could he call his insurance company? Give him the claim adjusters name, contact info and claim  , in case he doesn't have it.     If you decide you don't want to wait, or they cannot find him to make a liability decision, I would go through your own company. They'll take it from there and try and recover.

You might want to take it to someone (a preparer) in order to have it double checked. Even a preparer makes mistakes, difference is that a lot of companies offer audit support just in case you do get audited. Accuracy, not the size of your return, matters most.     I don't understand why taxes aren't more straightforward than they are, but they are. I've "helped" people before, then they've taken the same thing to an accountant and gotten completely different results. All I know is, you're liable if you mess up and get caught. Yes, it's a big "if", but when "if" happens, you are going to be up the creek if you have no clue what you are doing.|`|Va5Gjbeuaa	I used turbo tax both last year and this year and had no problems.
ZeDjn4cVaa	Maybe.    You have two choices.    (1) You can include the social security income this year and anywhere from 0% to 85% will be taxed depending upon the amount of your other income.    or    (2) you can recalculate our hypothetical tax liability for each year that you should have received the social security to see if reporting it in that year would have increased your tax liability.  You would then pay this year any additional taxes due.      Because you were a minor when the social security was paid, you probably had little or no income.  In this case the social security would most likely have not resulted in any additional tax.  So I would expect option (2) to be the most favorable and very likely lead to no tax due.  But you need to do the calculations and attach them to your tax return for the year in which you received the back pay of social security in order to avoid the IRS assessing taxes according to option (1).

It would be primary for you, secondary to your spouse. The parents birth date is what drives who is primary for children. If your birthdate is first in the calendar year (day and month only-year does not matter) then you would be primary for the children. If your spouses comes first, then his policy would be primary for the children. Then figure out the cost versus the benefit paid to see if it's worth it.    Also look at what is covered.

AA11284831	If you owned it for 1 year or less, the gain is taxed as ordinary income at your marginal rate.  If you owned it more than one year the lower long-term capital gains rates apply.  If your marginal rate inclusive of the gain is 15% or less, the rate for 2008 and 2009 is 0%.  It's normally 5%.  Other wise the rate is 15%.    You determine your gain by subtracting your cost basis from the net proceeds from the sale.  Your cost basis is whatever you paid for it plus the cost of any improvements that you made while you owned it.  The net proceeds from the sale is the sales price less any commissions and non-deductible closing costs.    If you sell at a loss, the loss is NOT deductible.|`|AA10469473	If your tax bracket is 25% or more (taxable income over $65,100 on a joint return) you'll pay 15% of the profit for capital gains tax.  If your taxable income (after deductions and exemptions are taken out) is less than $65,100 on a joint return you won't owe any tax.
sI3krJULaa	Nothing.    The only thing you could deduct would be any registration taxes, just like you can on your car.  or, if you paid more in sales tax than you did on state income tax, you can claim the sales tax if you itemize.    That's it, sorry. :0(|`|BoAEgaAGaa	One thing you can deduct possibly from purchasing the RV is the sales tax you paid.  There is a deduction on Sch. A for either the State and Local Income taxes you paid or the State and Local General Sales Tax, whichever is higher.    The Income taxes are the ones you pay to your state or locality which will show on your W-2, any balances due, or estimated payments made in the tax year.    The sales tax, if you don't have all your receipts, can be predetermined by a IRS table of the amount you should have paid during the year.  One item you can add to this is the sales tax up to your general rate, on a motor vehicle, which includes an RV.      See page A-2 and A-3 of the linked Sch. A instructions below.

You may however take a deduction on the sales tax you had paid on the RV.|`|qBCGH52haa	Although the RV can probably qualify as a second home, the only advantage would be if you borrowed money to pay for the RV using the RV as collateral for the loan.  Under these circumstances, the interest on the loan would be deductible if you itemized.  Since you paid cash for the RV, there are no tax advantages since there is no interest deduction.    Edit:    Additional info:  IRS publication 936 defines a home as:    "a house, condominium, cooperative, mobile home, house trailer, boat, or similar property that has sleeping, cooking and toilet facilities."|`|AA11284831	If the RV qualifies as a second home -- i.e. it has eating, sleeping, and toilet facilities --  you can deduct any mortgage interest.  You can always deduct personal and real property taxes.  Since you didn't take out a loan, the only thing that you can deduct is any ad-valorem personal property taxes that you paid in 2008.
d364b3d739b1b83e47f8e64ae18c9a13aa	Your personal allowance for the year is 6035, 3/4 of which is available for use against your first months salary, so no tax until your earnings exceed 6k.|`|6519ebed9a7615574f51a4cc92f392f5aa	Agree with above.    Your tax code represents a tax-free allowance of 6035 for the financial year from April 2008 to March 2009. Your income is 1500 per month which means you'll earn no more than 4500 this financial year, assuming you started in January.    Your allowance is higher than your total income will be, therefore, no tax, you lucky blighter!    You'll get taxed on your April 2009 salary though, as it's a new financial year, so enjoy it while you can :)

ZEwAalKPaa	I have just struck this on my youngest sons behalf. He got a reminder from the revenue about self assessment deadlines and as he never self assessed he did not know what they were on about so ignored it. I got involved just 4 days ago when he told me he had had a final reminder must submit his on line return by 31st.  When i looked at the situation it was obvious why he had to self assess. He was self employed for a couple of years but had an accountant who did his returns. He then went back into employment and paye but for the 2007-2008 tax year the first 2 months were self employed still so he does have to do a self assess this time round.    We got onto the hmrc website and registered and got his ID number but found, as you have, that you cannot complete the self assessment forms until you receive your on line account activation pin number. Which is ONLY sent by post - not email - and like you, if the tax office are slow and he does not get this pin number by saturday he is likely to get a 100 fine.    However, i feel that as your initial registration will be recorded as before the 31st you - and my son - would have good grounds to ask for the fine to be waived as it was hmrc's fault that you could not file by the due date. Note - i have checked the 2 or 3 letters he had about self assessing and none of them say anything about needing an activation code or that it would be sent by post with the likely delays there.

It's possible it's an internal reference number for the trouble ticket, or call number.  There's all kinds of things it could mean, but without understanding the context it was used in, it's almost impossible for me to say.    You don't need to be in a hurry because your tax forms aren't due until April 15.  The January 22 date was probably the date that the IRS received your W2's from your employer.    Edit:  Okay, it sounds as if the reference number is just an internal reference to your inquiry.  It's not any kind of secret code, or any number that the rest of us would ever use.  Just a way for you and another Customer Service rep to get back to the details of your request.    If they just got your info last Thursday, they probably don't really have status yet, since it's just in.  Give it another week or two before you check again.
cOYkCEZsaa	You could get a producer job but it is difficult and there is a lot of competition. You are better off raising a lot of money and starting your own studio that people can rent time in.|`|EKTO5p4Yaa	Question:  How do I make a small fortune in the recording industry?  Answer:  Start with a large fortune!    Jobs at a recording studio are very difficult to come by.  In the past, prior to computers, it took a producer, engineer and several assistant engineers to manipulate all the controls during a mix session.  Now, with computers, it only takes one.  On top of that, there are schools graduating hundreds of new "engineers" each month into a market that is already way over saturated.      All this competition has push pay and compensation way way down.  As a matter of fact, engineers now make a quarter of what they did in the 1970's and it is only getting worse.    Some may advise you to open your own place and get to work but the money required can be nothing short of astronomical and you'll have to spend it all because your competitors, the ones that have been in business forever, have all the vintage toys that are in such high demand.      I am not trying to discourage you but give you an honest assessment.  I would suggest becoming an unpaid intern at a local facility and getting a first hand look at the business in the area you wish to live.  Get a feel for the whole thing.    Oh yeah, to answer your final question, 99% of the people in the music industry, whether it be musicians, engineers or producers, never make any money what so ever - that is a fact.    Good luck,

OacSIfSiaa	A VA backed mortgage is not a guarantee that one will get the house.  The VA does not fund anything, they simply guarantee a percentage of the mortgage in case of default.    Also the VA would have to do a home inspection first to determine if the price is within the true value and the condition of the house.  IF this has not been done yet, then they (the VA) have not been informed.  Many lenders offer pre-approved just because a person is a veteran.  What they don't tell you is that they can spend days on end looking for a lender for the mortgage.  If the broker contacts too many lenders over a period of time, your credit report will take numerous hits.  As long as the broker does his "shopping" within 15 days, then your report will not indicate numerous inquiries.    It took me a month to close on my house and I went VA/FHA and my mortgage broker went to 4 different lenders to find one for us.    Cross your fingers and wish for the best.  Remember, they (the lender) will still consider your income and the purchase price, the VA part is just a little bit of help.    Hope this helps ease your worries.|`|AWSmknxLaa	VA loans are very slow    As long as you did not lie on your application,  it should be approved.

Search on your state's website for department of health or division of insurance.  They might have programs for low wage earners that are subsidized.      If neither of these pans out, then look into a high deductible insurance plan.  Something like you will be responsible for the first $1,000 of costs.

afa39a804ae93594034f326d518e6d8faa	That's a tough spot to be in, ma'am.     Ok, start by cutting up your credit cards. This will eliminate anymore spending on them and their high interest rates.  Keep looking for that job or consider starting up a small business doing anything. Just remember to do something, even if it is wrong, the action is what is important.     With that much debt you NEED to start a budget if you have not. Cut every expense that is not absolutely necessary, you have got to run a tight ship to pull through in tact.     Pay off your credit cards first, but be sure not to neglect your other debts. So continue your minimum payments! Your credit cards likely have the highest interest rates so they will kill you the fastest. Take every spare penny you can pinch and pay  down that principle.     Then you will want to pay off your boyfriend (and thank him for understanding and being patient). Pay him whatever payment you have been + whatever your credit card payments were (plus anything extra that is coming in). An alternative strategy to pay him and your Dad off first and then go to the credit card, but my preference would be to pay the CC because your boyfriend and Dad would likely be more understanding than the Credit Card company. Use your own judgment!     Pay off you Dad with the payments you have been making to your boyfriend and any extra cash.    Now pay off the Student loans. Continue the snowballing and keep attacking that principle! Slow and steady wins the race.    Ohhh, one last thought. There is a lot of money to be made part-time in the homade bread business. Lots of people will pay rather massive markups (.99 or less to make, sells for 5+ bucks). Everyone I know sells for at least $5 and actually sell the most at the 7.50 amount.    Kick that Debt!

YQ1Q7XeEaa	A resume is nice - but for a first retail job all you really need to do is look neat and presentable and drop by to ask for an application.    You can even mention this would be your first job on the application.    Just remember to smile, make good eye contact and that you would treat every customer the way you would want to be treated.
JXJvxhZPaa	Ideally you should be able to save up 20% of the value of the house you would like to buy as a down payment before you purchase it.  This will reduce your mortgage payment by reducing the principal and eliminating monthly mortgage insurance.  The problem many people have is living all the way up to their means.  Try to live on 80-90% of your income and save the rest so you have something to fall back on for mortgage payments should you find yourself in a difficult financial situation.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	The most you should consider paying for a home is 2.5 times your annual income. In your case, that would be about $150,000.    Keep in mind that most of the more expensive homes are purchased by two-income couples. If your spouse also made $60K, the two of you could very easily afford the kind of home you're talking about.|`|3BwPtNi2aa	In the state of the economy you have to be extremely careful in buying a home. Not only being able to afford the monthly mortgage payment but the chance of losing your job need to be taken into consideration. It's a scary time ...

It can be difficult finding a job if you are a journalist and there is a good chance you will be getting paid a shockingly low salary when you do.|`|WYjbuu6saa	You can't be paid a high salary if you can't even find a job.    You need good grades no matter which profession you choose.    Warning!  Jobs in the field of Law are drying up FAST!!  This is NOT a good field to invest in!!  Many reasons.  Main reason?....We simply have WAY TOO MANY Lawyers - we have a GLUT of Attorneys.    But the law schools won't tell you this - law students are easy money for them.  The law schools continue to churn out graduates even though they know the economy is SATURATED.  So even IF you finish law school, you won't be able to find a job when you are done - plus you'll owe approx $150,000+ in debts.    Suggestion:  Consider and look into the field of Healthcare!     Good luck.
AA10072911	If the company has any trouble processing your debit card they will contact you and request another payment method.  As long as the transaction went through before you canceled the card you should be fine.
AA12384724	I am not sure of New Jersey's unemployment laws, but this is how it is in Michigan. If your father were to quit his job he would not be able to receive unemployment. He would only be able to receive it if he were laid off by his employer. Unemployment payments are determined by how much you make weekly, so it is hard for me to give you an exact estimate, but it is usually about half or a little less.    You shouldn't confront your dad. I am sure your parents are taking care of the situation. I am sure your parents will make the best decision for your family. Whatever that decision ends up being.    I know it is hard to not think about the unforeseen future of your living situation and your family. But, I think you should just try and let it go, know your parents are capable adults of handling whatever comes your way. Be thirteen and enjoy your teen years while you can. If you feel really compelled to try and help your parents you could try and get a side job like delivering newspapers (i dunno if they still do that) or create your own side business selling cookies, building web pages, who knows, the world is your oyster. Or try and help them out around the house, you may not be able to support the money situation, but you can try and make home life a little stress free by helping around the house and such.     Stop stressing, you will be just fine.|`|Kwywmcs8aa	It varies from state to state.|`|jkTRaxFGaa	You should talk to your father about the whole situation. Don't jump to conclusions, you may be worrying over nothing. Also, your father may have money saved to take care of you guys until he finds another job. Don't worry! The amount of money received from unemployment varies. There is no set amount. Try to Google the average amount of unemployment received in your city. That should help.|`|zMqsHqGHaa	1. Depends a lot on the state & the circumstances.  2. You can ask if he wants to talk about it with you, but chances are he won't because he doesn't want to burden you with adult problems.  3. Just don't give your parents a hard time right now.    Financial problems in the adult world are not easily understood even by adults. You should let your parents worry about this and just keep being a kid. Your turn to stress out and worry will come soon enough. I applaud you for wanting to help, but probably the best way you can help right now is to just let the adults do the worrying - everything will work out.

If she doesn't move out take her things put them outside the apartment and change the locks.    Check you state laws on common law marriage.      Call an attorney for consultation.|`|PCsW0gbPaa	Feel free to kick her out.    It's possible that she could have a claim on something, but the burden of proof is on her.  She would have to take you to court and prove that she was, in fact, your common-law wife.  That's going to be tough for her to establish if you have tape of her bringing random guys back to the apartment.  If she does not leave voluntarily, you should call the police and tell them that she is refusing to leave your property.  Don't get violent about it or anything.  They will be on your side and they will escort her out.|`|RZzMse3Haa	It sounds like you own your unit- Is that correct?    If you own it then you can evict her.

Is her name on the lease? If not, kick her butt out!  Shoot... even if it is.. kick her out!   She's just your girlfriend, not your wife.  She isn't entitled to anything.|`|AA12225155	Is her name on the lease?  Is your name on her loan?     If she's not on the lease, then I would simply change the locks on the apartment and put her stuff on the street.  I personally, would also print pictures of her with the other men and tape it to the top of each stack of stuff.  But I'm a little more vindictive than most.  If she tries to get back in, call the cops.      If her name is on the lease, I would move out and tell your landlord your situation and get your name off the lease.  There's nothing you can do.     If your name is not on the loan, just stop paying her loan.    If your name is on her loan, then call the loan officer or the banks or wherever you need to to try to get your name off of it.  I don't think you can and if you stop paying, it will affect your credit.  Hopefully you were smart enough to not put your name and SS  down for her.     I think domestic partnerships are based on what state you live in, but I always thought that's after 10 years of living together.  So I think you're okay there.  And she's not entitled to anything that she didn't pay for.  Even if you were married, you get everything because she's the one who cheated, which is apparently still against the law.     Good luck, dude.

However, if you are new to investing you should stick with mutual funds.  The best are no load funds.|`|3f43024b890acb9ec398f800fe6b3de7aa	If you do not have a lot of money to invest, put it into mutual funds.  It is set up for novice investors.

Then you will be in a better position to invest in one particular stock only.  Remember any profits you make from the sale of a stock is taxed.|`|8204cb9cf632147bd04be506523f70e5aa	1) Yes.  2) Yes.  3) www.fool.com ; www.aaii.com ; www.morningstar.com  4) A discount broker lets you easily buy & sell stocks, bonds, other things too. (I have Scottrade - $7.00 to buy or sell) If you can use YA, you can use one of them. There are research screens that you can look at the price history of the stock you are interested in. Yahoo Finance is also very educational & helpful - I use them all the time and they are free.    I must recommend the Motley fool site, I learned alot there. There are many good, informative sites.     The only ones that I would avoid are the ones that use GIANT HEADLINES to try to get you to BUY this stock BEFORE ...... HAPPENS !!!!!! You will know. Never buy from them. The serious sites might have a service you can purchase of monthly recommendations, or a model porfolio you can look at.    First thing, learn something about the market. Get a basic investing book (there are lots at the local library) and then A RANDOM WALK DOWN WALL STREET by R. Malkiel which readably describes what the market actually is and how it works the way it does.    Also, look at CDs at www.bankrate.com     Good Investing to you!    ;-)|`|2a6a9101ce6842ff31336ffa5f278c1caa	Do not.. I repeat.. Do not put 100$ into the stock market. You're better off putting it into a CD until you learn what you're doing.    Firstly Id recommend learning something first. Any book by Peter Lynch is a great read and will teach you A LOT.  Secondly, most brokerage firms charge commission on all trades. I believe one of the cheapest is Scottrade with $5 per trade. And with 100$ commission will KILL you. You should go into the stock market with at least a minimum of 1500$ to have any positive effect. Trust me, Ive been in the same position as you, except I had about 1000$, and had to learn the hard way.     Yahoo finance is a good place to research stocks, I use it daily.    GOOD LUCK and Happy Investing!|`|894f540361bf8fdffd9419c6727aac77aa	1. your stock goes down by  $13.41 but it will not be taken away from your investment unless you sell the stock.    2. again, not unless you sell it.  3. you may want to know the basics of stocks and other investments thru investopedia.com  4.  it depends on how you bought it.  if it's from an agent/broker, you can sell it thru him too.

Most banks have either free checking or fee based checking. Take a look at your statements, they may say what kind of account you have and from there you can check on your bank's website about what fees are related to what types of accounts.
r9nxFkGtaa	It depends on the bank - they all have different rules regarding their accounts.  Some have no minimum balance, some have quite high minimums.  You will need to call your bank and ask.|`|uVQ6OSu3aa	You opened the account, you should know what this min/max is. Call the bank and ask.|`|WuDXQGBgaa	you need to ask your bank that question. nobody here knows that answer. sorry !!!!|`|6oC6k6hQaa	You need to check the information with your bank.  Most all banks requirements are different when it comes to a minimum balance.  I would imagine after a year or so with no activity it will be closed on the basis of a dormant account.|`|snh9wzpnaa	That is probably enough to keep it open but you can ask your bank for sure.  Certain types accounts charge you fee if you drop below a certain level though.  Another question for your bank.|`|zuGKIWfNaa	That depends on the rules of your particular bank -- but if your bank requires that you maintain a minimum balance, you might want to consider changing banks. Many banks don't have any such requirement.|`|4wIZfiWaaa	If you have a regular checking account, most banks offer this option, then they do not require you to have a minimum balance. But if you do not use that account for a couple of months, say 8-12 months, they might cancel it. Call your bank for more details.

DEwZDSdPaa	Depuis tout petit j'tais fascin par le monde des Sapeur-Pompiers, je souhaitais en faire mon mtier comme beaucoup des petits gar?ons sauf que moi cette envie ne m'est jamais passe.    Vers l'age de 12/13 ans, je suis rentr dans les Jeunes Sapeur-Pompiers, c'est en quelque sorte des cours hebdomadaire d'incendie, de secourisme, de sport mais aussi de valeurs et d'altruisme. On y apprend tout ce qui concerne le mtier, bien que l'on ne puisse pas raliser d'interventions.    Durant ma scolarit que je poursuivais en parallle, mon objectif tait d'avoir un DUT capable de me permettre de passer le concours d'Officier Sapeur-Pompiers Professionnel, je me suis donc donn cet objectif malgr que je ne sois pas un lve extrmement brillant ... J'ai travaill et  mont de classe en classe au fil des annes.    A 17 ans je me suis engag comme Sapeur-Pompier volontaire, je l'ai t pendant 4 annes en parallle de mes tudes. J'ai d? suspendre mon engagement parce que mes deux dernires annes (bac +4 et +5) taient trop loin de chez moi pour me permettre de poursuivre.    Malheureusement, les circonstances ont fait que je n'ai pas pu aller tudier l bas, je me suis donc retrouv  l'ANPE avec un bac +3 et avec des soucis de sant qui compromettent normment mes chances de raliser mon rve de petit gar?on. Je peux me sentir pas vraiment bien en l'espace de quelques minutes et je me vois mal assumer ce mal tre physique en plein milieu d'un incendie ...    Aujourd'hui je travaille dans la prvention des risques, c'est toujours dans la scurit et la protection des personnes (notamment dans le cadre de leur travail puisque j'exerce dans un Service de Sant au Travail).

wQJBFcluaa	You're doing a "clients" taxes and you have to ask if she qualifies for anything?|`|WuDXQGBgaa	you can file a tax return for her if you like,but that doesn't mean she'll get a refund.  she had no job so she gets no refund,the income she had she didn't earn so no earned income credit either.|`|6oC6k6hQaa	Welfare and child support ARE NOT taxable incomes.  Therefore your client will get nothing.  She has to have had actual EARNED INCOME... welfare and child support are NOT in that category.  You do not just get free money for having kids, if you did, I would have had 40 more of them!|`|AA11284831	You're doing someone else's tax return and don't know the answer to that?  Please stop doing "client" tax returns; you're not qualified.    Public assistance and child support are not taxable and are not reported on a tax return.  If this is her only income, put down the mouse and delete her information from the machine.  There is NO reason for her to file a tax return.|`|BoAEgaAGaa	No, you have to have some earned income to receive the Earned Income Credit.

And you do know that if you get paid to do someone's taxes (and since you say "client" I assume you are expecting to get paid) you have to identify yourself on her return?  And that you are violating the TaxCut licensing agreement if you are using it commercially?    The $1000 child tax credit is not a refundable credit, so since she owes no tax, she doesn't qualify for that.      If her only income is welfare and child support, she has no reason to file a return other than to give YOU some income.|`|57nT5ubbaa	I am not positive but i would say no.  Welfare is considered unearned income there for not taxable.

After 30 days, you will then need to call them to cancel your subscription otherwise you will be charge for monthly payment, AND that is why they need your credit card (The after 30 day trial).     Most people don't call and cancel it.
04cb17cc7c7b19d7e182c1f6dad2782eaa	from what you told me about yourself i would say you'd make a good lawyer!:)
HFlytHlRaa	The closet thing a 15-year-old could get to a credit card would be a debit card (i.e. like Visa Buxx, a debit card marketed specifically towards teens. I had one when I was 15.)  The difference between a credit card and debit card is that you can only spend money that you have. (Your parent, or you, load money on to the card so you can't get yourself into debt. Or you can use a checking card if you open a checking account.)  Other than that, they act the same way and can be used anywhere a credit card is accepted.    However, someone over 18 has to set up the account.|`|3sGkmzOYaa	If you have not paid any bills, that means you don't have credit, If you don not have a bank account you wont be able to get one.

He may be trying to claim the earned income credit by having you as a dependent, but it appears that claim would be illegal, and you should not be helping him do that.    File your own taxes.    He has to file on his own SSN, not yours. Once you get your w-2s or 1099s, file your own return. It will not make any difference if he files before you, except he will hear from the IRS about changing his return.

fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	CT landlord/tenant laws do NOT have a mandatory grace period requirement on leases.  If one exists, it's only because the landlord chose to include on in his/her lease.|`|vCePK8gMaa	Yes, CT state landlord tenant laws allow the tenant to pay rent by the 9th day after rent is due without a late fee or the threat of eviction. The landlord cannot ignore the grace period - it is state law.    If rent is due on the 1st, CT law allows the tenant until the 10th to pay the rent.    The landlord cannot charge a late fee until the 11th. The landlord cannot serve a Notice to Quit due to non-payment of rent until the 11th.      Sec. 47a-4. Terms prohibited in rental agreement. (a) A rental agreement shall not provide that the tenant: 8) agrees to pay a late charge prior to the expiration of the grace period set forth in section 47a-15a or to pay rent in a reduced amount if such rent is paid prior to the expiration of such grace period.     Sec. 47a-15a. Nonpayment of rent by tenant: Landlord's remedy. If rent is unpaid when due and the tenant fails to pay rent within nine days thereafter or, in the case of a one-week tenancy, within four days thereafter, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement in accordance with the provisions of sections 47a-23 to 47a-23b, inclusive.|`|9FCxm8qJaa	Grace period for what? not paying rent, late rent?

It takes 2 years for them to find you, so in 2011 you will either have a tax offset on federal if you didn't receive the letters or didn't bother paying any mind to them. 3 years from now if you don't report the income, you will receive a letter from the state saying you owe tax lien.

s2VFuFdHaa	while the one answer is right about having less income could reduce you EIC, I would guess if I looked at your return, that you have entered % of your house for the business use form.  If you use the home office form, it can reduce your sch A expenses (mortgage interest and real estate taxes) by the % you use for your home office.  I would also suggest NOT using this form if you own your own home.  Most tax preparers screw this form up.  If you read the instructions CAREFULLY, it will tell you if you use this form you must recapture and pay gains tax (on an otherwise excluded gain) on the portion of your home that was depreciated or depreciable on the home office form.

T6ZT3A57aa	Most countries have laws which require the finder to take lost property to the nearest Police Station and leave it there. This is so that the rightful owner can retrieve it by giving satisfactory proof of ownership. If after the required period of time the property has not been claimed then it becomes the property of the finder, they are notified and able to claim it.     If you lost something valuable, and then went to the Police Station in the vicinity to report it lost, wouldn't it be nice to get it back, because some honest person had done the right thing.

Name every dollar in the budget and stop, stop, stop spending, use the clothes and shoes you already have and only shop for necessities, stop dining out and lunching out, start cooking everything from scratch it is cheaper and healthier.  Frozen foods, prepackaged foods and specialty products are super expensive.  Avoid them.      For those accounts who are past due, try to get current the best that you can, then start negotiating with them lower payments locked for X amount of time and start paying them off one by one starting by putting the minimum they want.  Once you pay off the first credit card roll that monthly payment to the next one this will give you more money to cancel the next one and so one.  If you really buckle up and if you really want to clean your debt and credit you can get rid of it within 2 to 3 years depending on your income.  If you have two cars and are making payments on them sell one of them or both and get beater cars you need to make drastic changes whether you use a managing company or not.      Personal finances is 80% behavior and 20% math.  So it is up to you.     Good Luck!!!!!!

Je suis informaticien, avec un diplome Bac+5, et je peux te dire une chose: l'engouement pour cette profession dans les annes 90 a t tel que beaucoup de gens s'y sont engouffrs !    Bilan: le travail que faisait un Bac+2 hier est aujourd'hui confi  des Bac+5 (dveloppement d'applications par exemple). Du coup, les diploms niveau Bac+2 se voient souvent confier des boulots ingrats et mal pays (Hotline, assistance aux utilisateurs, installations et configurations de PCs, etc.) et font office de grouillots de base de fond d'organigramme ! Ce domaine est donc bouch; j'ajouterais mme que l'informatique est aujourd'hui un secteur sinistr ou en proie de l'tre !    Je m'explique: la plupart des boulots proposs sont souvent ingrats et mal pays (un dipl?m Bac+5 dbutant ne touche que 25  28 kE en moyenne  l'anne, ce qui est largement insuffisant pour vivre aujourd'hui, surtout pour quelqu'un qui s'est crev  faire 5 annes d'tudes, mais ce qui est nanmoins acceptable par rapport  de nombreux boulots qui sont pays 3 roubles de l'heure !). De plus, la plupart des offres d'emplois en informatique sont dtenues par les SSII qui, comme chacun le sait, sont pour la plupart des antichambres de la prcarit, proposant des CDI de chantier, des clauses de non concurrence  la mord moi le noeud dans les contrats / des contrats limites, une convention collective souvent pourrie (SYNTEC), etc. bref, que du bonheur !!    Donc je m'excuse par avance pour t'avoir dpeint un tableau si noir du monde actuel de l'informatique, mais j'aurais t malhonnte (ou alors DRH ;-) ) si je t'avais dress un portrait idyllique de l'emploi dans le domaine de l'informatique !    Si je peux me permettre une suggestion: essaie plut?t, si tu en as la possibilit, de faire des tudes de mdecine ou de pharmacie, ou alors de trouver une planque dans la fonction publique (si toutefois cela existe encore !): tu seras peut tre mieux reconnu et la pnibilit de ton travail sera s?rement bien moindre ! Autre solution: se barrer  l'tranger, par exemple dans un pays scandinave (je connais un peu la Sude et, outre le climat, c'est pas mal du tout !) ou anglo saxon, o, je pense, on laisse bien plus leurs chances aux salaris par rapport  leurs motivations !    Si toutefois tu souhaites vraiment bosser dans le domaine de l'informatique, je te conseille de te mettre sur SAP: c'est, je pense, une des seules voies royales qui paie vraiment bien et dans laquelle il y a de vraies opportunits aujourd'hui !! Si tu montres que tu connais SAP, peu importe tes diplomes, ce sera plus facile pour toi de trouver !    Dans l'absolu, si je peux me permettre un conseil: n'hsite pas  broder un peu pendant les entretiens,  te vendre comme un malade, et surtout, surtout: ne laisse pas les recruteurs te faire baisser tes prtentions salariales, car ?a, crois-moi, ils savent trs bien faire !!! Donc mefiat.... Aprs, le plus important est de leur montrer que tu en veux, que tu es motiv.    Bon courage  toi en tous cas !|`|S19wp9xKaa	A part oprateur de saisie, je vois pas trop.    Mais bon, l'informatique ?a veux pas dire grand chose... c'est vraiment trs large.
80964f21132d1fcb86276ffdb2e5bc6daa	Le problme, c'est qu'il est d'ordre contextuel: d"un c?t, l'Etat (donc tes imp?ts) bouche les trous  cause de dcisionnaires financiers inconsquents et qui en plus vont se pavaner dans des h?tels 5 toiles avec leur clique; de l'autre c?t, on vient nous sao?ler qu' cause de la rcession, on va se serrer la ceinture....    Et je vais aller plus loin: on nous prtexte qu'il faut venir  la rescousse des banques car elles octroient des crdits, mais quand tu veux un crdit, elles te demandent tout un stock de garanties pour leur propre scurit...    Et tout ?a pour quoi? Pour en arriver  tout ce qui se passe...    Dsol, mais quand on se dit ultra-libral politiquement, alors on ne pratique pas la politique d'intervention de l'Etat (politique keynsienne) et ceci uniquement aux entreprises bancaires...

6a6657514a0abf33529e255f377b21cbaa	The only legitimate mystery shooper job that I have ever heard of was when my Dad was the the marketing manager of a convenience store chain where I live.  They hired a company that provided "mystery shoppers" that visited each store anonymously and would submit reports on their experiences.  I would suggest to contact some of the major retailers near you, ask to speak to an office manager, and ask who they use.  This should give you the name of a legitimate company for you to contact and you will know that it is not a scam. Please be careful and always remember that if it sounds too good to be true, it ususally is.|`|AA10464818	There are indeed a lot of scams in terms of mystery shopping jobs.     I suggest you go to the National Mystery Shopping Providers Association (MSPA) http://www.mysteryshop.org , an organization of mystery shopping companies. Check out their listing of shopping assignments by country and by state from member companies. Companies are accepted as members of the association only if they have been in existence for two years and they can submit proof of business existence. Make a list of these companies and check out their requirements to be a mystery shopper.    The MSPA North America has a job board listing available mystery shoppers position http://www.jobslinger.com/mspa/exec/sfs/...    If in doubt, double-check the company with the local Better Business Bureau http://www.bbb.org , usually under the Service Intelligence category. Find out if any complaints have been lodged with the mystery shopping company, before agreeing to do work for them.|`|6Zj4dq7Oaa	Look on momprenuers.com they have lists on scams and real online jobs

8b028b26243f61a71dc2340de763e962aa	That depends on your mortgage company. Most mortgage holders will insist that property insurance and taxes are paid through an escrow fund. That protects them from homeowners failing to pay those items themselves.    If your home does not have a mortgage, you can pay those things directly. In fact, if your home has no mortgage, you don't have to have insurance at all (but you'd most likely be foolish not to).|`|H0yNSdeTaa	You can be.  It depends upon the lender and your agreement with them.  Why would you pay your homeowners insurance when you're paying into an escrow fund.  Let the system do what it's designed to do and it will work fine.|`|c18dbccca3730f373f5b05c3ee929815aa	No, you won't have to pay an escrow account for homeowner's insurance. Just make sure your mortgage company knows you are paying the insurance. You may, however, still have an escrow fund for your property taxes or previous unpaid homeowner's insurance.

The downfall to it is that even in ATL, there aren't that many branches.  But, they do allow you to use other branches ATMs without charging you if you are not withing a certain distance to one of theirs.  I think your best bet would be Wachovia.  I love them, and they are like almost everywhere.  Plus, they have better customer service that WAMU and depending on the status of your account with them, you could cash an out of state check (insurance, school check) right then.  With WAMU, it is two weeks holding period for a big out of state check and one week holding period for a in-state check.|`|H0yNSdeTaa	They lost some of my money.  Try a credit union.

Both will tell you that you can withhold rent if the place is found to be unsafe and uninhabitable.|`|c5c312b14ef66a5eebd8cd62c209ae41aa	You have to pay your rent. You wre right in calling the city. If they come out and say that you home is inhabitable and you actually can not live there that is when you don't pay rent. But that is definate not the way to live. I'm so sorry to hear about how they are treating you. Is it in your lease contract about not having bugs before you moved in because if it's not in writing then it's just he said she said. Everything has to be in writing for it to be legal. But it is your landlord's responsiblity to keep everything up to the codes of your city or county. So that is in the contract and much be fixed. GOOD LUCK :)

Its the same.  But on a health notice on the topic:    If you fill a small bottle from a water cooler bottle of "Mineral/spring" etc at work, it will not contain chlorine.  consequently your refill bottle on your desk will breed bacteria very quickly and you will be worse off than drinking tap.  You also need to wash your cup with soap to kill the bacteria.  If you refill from a tap, your bottle will stay clean for a lot longer.

u1rDl3e8aa	Work 2 jobs, that is what most people do. It will take some time to get business built up and you will have to learn marketing and all of the in's and out's of the real estate business. You should work as an assistant to a top agent to learn how the business really works.|`|3apK8Lyfaa	If your passion is to be in real estate - go for it.    Save some $$$, because it will take some time to get started. 6-8 months income would be a safe bet, to keep the stress levels down while you are waiting for your first closing - and because you will be paying all kinds of business related costs up front, just to get started (MLS and local board fees, classes and test fees, licensing fees, errors & omissions insurance, marketing and advertising costs, computer, printer, general business supplies, etc.)    Make a business plan - if you've never done this before, go online for examples, contact a local SCORE volunteer, ask your banker, or your broker, once you get started. Plan your work, and work your plan!    Go to class online or in person and LEARN your STUFF. Don't learn the minimum required to pass the tests. Your customers will be relying on you to be an expert, so soak it in. I would recommend attending classes in person so you get all your dumb questions answered immediately and to your satisfaction.    Interview several brokers until you find one you like, that offers excellent training and support, has a congenial atmosphere, and a record of success - plus a good reputation.    Then, get out there! Let everybody you know hear that you are in real estate now - shout it to the skies, email and snail mail everybody with your new business card, send out marketing materials and advertise yourself.    Work your business plan.    And, remember, the idea of earning 6% commission on every sale - that's a fantasy.    Think of the 6% commission as a pie. Let's say the sales price of the house was $200,000. 6% of that is $12,000, yes?    So, 1/2 of the pie goes to the listing BROKER (not the agent) and 1/2 goes to the selling BROKER. That would be $6,000 to each side.    Then, the BROKER shares their piece of the pie with the agents involved. Most agents get 50-60% of that piece of pie, depending on your individual deal.     That means, you as the new selling agent might get $3,000 - minus your franchise fees, E&O insurance, and all of your related costs.    If you get lucky, you might be both the listing and the selling agent, and earn $6,000 minus expenses, but you will never get the full 6% commission on any deal.     And your commission income is taxable by Uncle Sam.    Another way of looking at this is - if you sell $1Million in real estate, and you are essentially getting your 1/4 piece of the pie, you will earn $15,000 in commission, minus expenses. If your cut of the pie is larger, the income will be larger, but not as a new agent.    Again, if this is your passion, go for it. Treat it like a real full time job, work it hard. But this is not a get rich quick program - or everybody and their dog would be a realtor!!!    Good luck and best wishes.|`|DlzSQxXcaa	DO not quit you job at the car wash, It is how you can keep the dream alive...being close to those LEXUS,mercedes,bmw, will help..

vp8806Eraa	it's because they've removed the link to your note and the gold held in the bank of england vault. Basically your note is now worth whatever they decide it's worth!!<br>  <br>  "The words "I promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of five [ten/twenty/fifty] pounds" date from long ago when our notes represented deposits of gold. At that time, a member of the public could exchange one of our banknotes for gold to the same value. For example, a ￡5 note could be exchanged for five gold coins, called sovereigns. But the value of the pound has not been linked to gold for many years, so the meaning of the promise to pay has changed. Exchange into gold is no longer possible and Bank of England notes can only be exchanged for other Bank of England notes of the same face value. Public trust in the pound is now maintained by the operation of monetary policy, the objective of which is price stability"

49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Not legally, the two accounts are separate, which is why NH never allows the landlord to co-mingle them.<br>  <br>  He can easily sue you for breaking the lease (will show up like an eviction on your credit report) because of non-payment.     He will end up with the deposit and you will have to write an additional check for the court damages.|`|Tyq8OYm1aa	No.  Security deposits are not for rent.  They are deposits against damage.|`|kifwyOgKaa	No because your security deposit is just that, a security deposit.  It is not held to be used as monthly rent.  <br>  <br>  The landlord will hold on to the security deposit until you do your move-out inspection.  If he/she feels the property is left in as good condition as it was when you moved in, you are entitled to have the security deposit returned to you.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	No you can't use the security deposit for your rent.  The fact that he didn't advise you of the deposit account is another issue.  Google landlord tenant laws in your state.  Most states require the deposit notification IF the money is placed in an interest bearing account.  Assuming this is a breach of the lease, you would have to give him time to cure it or go to court and since you are leaving there's no reason to pursue it now.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|mUdeM1Dqaa	There are many laws to protect your security deposit, for both you and the landlord. The reason you pay one is to protect the landlord against damages you may cause while living in the apartment. Therefore, you cannot apply the security to the last months rent. If the landlord has issues with damage, he will take it from the deposit. Its like insurance. Then you will be paid the remainder.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is pay your final rent out of pocket. When moving out, take photos of everything showing the condition you left the place. Keep the landlord's  and real estate owner's contact info so you can follow up with the security a few weeks after you move. If you don't get a full refund, you can contest the damages if you think they are unfair and bring the landlord to court. If the landlord never pays you any of the security, you can also win in court. Keep your copy of your original lease with the terms and conditions. You will need this to back yourself up.|`|pNy8lakjaa	First off you can't do that. Your security deposit is ONLY used for damages to the place after you move out. Make sure that after you move, both you and your landlord do a walk though together if possible to assess any damages, and before you move, take pictures with a date/time stamp to prove you left the place in great immaculate condition, if he comes back and says there were some damages. <br>  <br>  By law he has to give you your deposit back within a certain amount of time after you rent, (between 21 to 30 days, depending on your local laws) with a list of any deductions he made for any damages. If he doesn't then you can sue in small claims for your deposit, and you will get it back plus court fees. <br>  <br>  Oh and finally, your landlord doesn't have to tell you what he did with the deposit, he has to pay you 1k when you do move out, that much is for certain.|`|JArP31vKaa	The answer should be spelled out in your lease.|`|LpVwWJVsaa	This is something that you will have to talk over with your landlord.  In some cases they will allow you to use your security deposit as last month's rent, however, if there are any damages to the property, you run the risk of getting stuck with a bill.  I would consult with legal aid of some sort, listed on the bottom of this reply, and check to see if it's allowed.<br>  <br>  I did find this on the web for you:<br>  <br>  New Hampshire law (RSA 540-A) defines a security deposit as any money that a tenant gives to his or her landlord other than the monthly rental payment. The name given to the payment -- cleaning deposit, last month’s rent in advance, etc. -- does not matter. The amount is a “security deposit” if it is anything other than the monthly rent. <br>  <br>  In New Hampshire, a landlord who owns more than six units can ask for no more than one month’s rent or $100, whichever is larger, as a security deposit. The landlord must keep security deposits in a special escrow account or post a bond with the local municipality to secure repayment.<br>  <br>  RETURN OF DEPOSIT: When the tenant moves out of a rental unit, the landlord has thirty (30) days in which to either return the entire security deposit plus interest if appropriate, or send a written statement of any deductions made from the deposit for repairs, cleaning, etc., the cost of each repair (supported by copies of appropriate receipts, estimates, contracts, etc.) along with the remaining amount of the deposit (RSA 540-A:7). The tenant needs to notify the landlord of his or her new address within 30 days of moving out. The notice must be in writing, but need not be formal. <br>  <br>   The tenant is entitled to a receipt for the deposit. The receipt must indicate the bank in which the deposit is being held, or state that there is a bond posted with the town clerk, and must state that the tenant has five (5) days to give the landlord a list of defects and damages in the apartment when she or he moved in. If the security deposit is held for more than 12 months, the landlord must pay at least the amount of interest she or he has actually earned on the money.<br>  <br>  A good source of help for landlord-tenant problems is New Hampshire Legal Assistance. There are several branches of New Hampshire Legal Assistance around the state:<br>  <br>  Manchester: 603-668-2900 or 1-800-562-3174<br>  Claremont: 603-542-8795 or 1-800-562-3994<br>  Portsmouth: 603-431-7411 or 1-800-334-3135<br>  Littleton: 603-444-8000 or 1-800-548-1886|`|NejieeEeaa	Ok let me help you because you don't quite understand the world of tenant and landlords!<br>  <br>  You cannot properly use your deposit for rent without the written approval of the landlord. <br>  <br>  The deposit is security for whatever damage and cleanup the landlord may need.<br>  <br>   You should pay rent through the end of the last month of your tenancy.<br>  <br>  The landlord must return your deposit or provide an accounting within the next month. If he fails to respond, you can sue him for the deposit.<br>  <br>  PS.<br>  If this is not what you are looking for, PLEASE go by the library and pick up Landlords and Tenant ACT BOOK!

It is absurd of you to jump to any conclusions and then decide upon yourself that you are above the law.<br>  <br>  You should move out, probably to somewhere where you are not exposed to other people.|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Don't change the locks as that would (probably) breach the terms of your lease.  You landlord has the right to enter the property upon reasonable notice, unless it's a emergency.  Google landlord tenant laws in your state, then notify your landlord in writing that in the future he needs to notify you in advance.  Now, are you sure it's your landlord?  Most of keys and don't need to break in.  If it happens again report the break in to the police.<br>  <br>  realtor.sailor|`|ikXRqWxUaa	1.  can you absolutely prove that the landlord is the one doing this?  if you can't, be very careful about accusations.  <br>  <br>  2.  legally, you cannot just change the locks in an apartment.  it must be accessible for emergencies.  it is not your property and you could be evicted for this.  <br>  <br>  3.  the usual rule is that the landlord must give 24 hours notice of intent to go into an apartment in non-emergencies.|`|7oF2o4q5aa	Everyone else is right about the locks, etc.<br>  <br>  I would borrow a video camera or use a web cam to aim at the door and see who it is!  You can use that against whoever it is.|`|72b1b35e81e7d39e237e18972e90ad30aa	here is what you do..change the locks,and give him a key..Tell him you think someone has broken in and you filed a complaint...That will shock him if he was the one..without accusing him directly...|`|ef4b0b9eb5f80f99b4a112e5e254c3d2aa	change the lock imediately,no law refuses your privacy and security|`|LpVwWJVsaa	This is a difficult situation.  I am a property manager here in Michigan and we have a provision in our lease and resident handbook that prohibits residents from making modifications on their apartments without our written permission.  In our case, residents are not allowed to change the locks without us obtaining a key in case of an emergency.<br>  <br>  I would contact your local legal aid office and see what steps you have for remedying this situation<br>  <br>  Good luck

SN5dYkafaa	The entire "wash sale" period is 61 calendar days; 30 days before you sell the stock, the date of sale, and 30 days after the sale. If you recover your position (BUY) in a "substantially similar" security during this period, the loss will be disallowed, and the unused loss added to the basis of the new position.<br>  <br>  In English, if you sold a stock for a loss and want to repurchase it, wait at least 31 days if you'd like to write-off the loss.<br>  <br>  PS - be sure to choose your "Best Answer" when the time comes.

Patrick obviously never heard of the Wash Sale Rule.
EzrdyxAiaa	normally it would only be good for ninty days!!! but it might slip through!!!|`|AA11203798	look on the back, money orders usually have a expiry date on them, alternatively phone the bank or organisation that issued it and ask them.|`|4a189cf0bb5e0c77392a26e3764e81f4aa	Yes, it is still good. I know that Bank checks, (official or cashiers) are good for up to 7 years.  I am sure that for Money orders it is a similar timeline.

They require tallness and being thin, with a nice face. They obviously don't want someone that is not attractive representing their line of products. You are to wear what they say, and have anything on you look the way they want it or you are fired. Yea.|`|PFyzNGizaa	HI <br>  well All kind of job info here you have just choose the kind of job and read about that and may be you will be solve your matter as soon as possible <br>  <a href="http://futurevisionpk.com" rel="nofollow">http://futurevisionpk.com</a> <br>  <a href="http://farmacy-online.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://farmacy-online.blogspot.com</a><br>  thank you
