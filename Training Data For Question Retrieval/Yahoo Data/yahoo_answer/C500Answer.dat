2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	water??? are you thirsty perhaps??    or just get a lemon and cut it in half and squeeze the juice into a mug and top with warm water ......... sip through a straw to protect the enamel on your teeth ........ the fresh lemon juice will realkalise your system and help to resolve the tummy pains ....... have another if you need to ........ fresh lemon juice will also increase the production of hydrochloric acid in your tummy thus aiding in digestion and constipation.    edit ?    also take a multi B complex supplement ...... the b complex of vitamins are essential for healthy neural, immune and digestive functioning and are usually the first group to be used up when we are stressed........ but should only be taken as part of a whole complex ie ~ B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B12 folic acid etc..... as they work best as a group ....... Blackmores do a good one....... seriously buddy, vitamins aren't all the same...... some are just flat out bed pan bullets ....... ;0)    peace baby  ?

JoPr4Kouaa	I'm so sorry, you have been through a lot. I don't even know what to say to that except, You are an incredible inspiration to those who don't go out there and try like you did. You had something that could hold you back and you tried anyway. I'm proud of you and your family should be. They will come around. I'm sure they wanted you to stick with him as they thought it would be easier than this. But you just need to convince them that you needed to try, at least for you. And, you did that, I take my hat off to you.. Now you need to pray and have faith in our father. He'll be there for you. Just believe. But you did go through way too much and I hope everything works out for you. You keep your head up, okay?|`|cOhBczt1aa	awww....I'm so sorry this has happened and that your life is going this way.  But listen. I'm not sure if you're religious, but...I am. So, God is there for you. I know times like these can be very lonely and you feel like your life is going absolutely nowhere and you can't get out of the already-deep rut that you're in, but God is there. God is always there for you. He'll always be there for you. And I know people say it's times like these that God isn't there for us. But, He is. God helps those who help themselves. And as long as you are doing your best to live your life as a human, God will always forgive you and welcome you.   There will be another day. One day you will rise above this rut that you are in; you will come out on top one day; whether that is on this Earth or in Heaven; you'll be happy someday.    If your family is treating you like that, then shame on them. Family is meant to be there for you in times like these. When Judgement Day comes, they will have to answer to God.   I know the feeling of being a failure; I go to school with many people who are much smarter than I am and I am always ashamed to show others my grades because I always have the lower of the two. My viewpoint has become one of not caring; I just brush it off. I learn my lesson, and try to improve next time. You must learn to take certain things with a grain of salt; that has become my new approach to my failures. If I fail, there are more chances. No matter what, there will most likely 99.99% sure be another chance to redeem yourself. Maybe not at the same place, maybe not with the same people, but there are always new beginnings. But you must stick with it.   So just know that there will be more opportunities in your life in which you can redeem yourself, whether now or later. Don't ever feel alone, because God is ALWAYS there.     (If you cannot find anyone to talk to and if you ever need someone, I'm all ears. You may PM me, if you must.)   :)|`|8DzYsUFWaa	...|`|2C8U7Itqaa	I've hit some LOW points in my life... Not going into them because THIS is about you.

I live in apartment, by myself, in a brand new area where I have nobody, with almost NO money and have to deal with waking up with basically nothing. But I push on each day, because my life WILL get better, I will make sure of that. Just live each day to the fullest, and do anything you can and say "YES" to other things in life...

They don't like to lose students, makes the school look bad.  Worth a try.  You also might be able to find a suitable roommate at school to help with rent.  Sounds like you need a good support system.  Have you tried explaining to your family that you chose an education so you could eventually make your own way in life instead of having to depend on a husband?  If they don't come around, try to find others who will give you moral support.

Even if you can't finish - I promise the time you've spent is not wasted - no experience is.      I have had some really low points on my journey to where I am today, but I'm 38 now, with a job I love, a great family - and a contented life - I'm sure it will all happen for you, too    I'd be happy for you to contact me if you need support.

If the child isn't part of a play group or is just use to playing alone chances are he doesn't know how to play with other children.    I'm sure your friend's pediatrition is monitoring his development. Let him/her make the diagnosis.
K7x1RHVFaa	The thing about acting is to learn the lines and then make them your own. You are probably thinking that the people are seeing you when in fact they are seeing the character you play. This is where making the role your own comes into play. When you do this the audience will see you but the world sees you all the time and that is comfortable. Contemplate on what your character is doing and how you would feel in those circumstances. Use that feeling when you talk to the other performers you will be sharing a little of who you are and hopefully they will too. It will become a team effort to bring words to life. If you find yourself looking out on the audience and the lights are not down pick a point in the back of the the room an pretend it is right in front of you. The audience is not there. The wall is. You are supposed to be talking to air in that moment. And if you are really good and few are find the angst in the moment and see the life in the moment. When you can do that you can be a star.    Good Luck.|`|CCqqTw6paa	they say try to visualize the crowd naked  never works for me though|`|Y0zNfd19aa	try giving yourself a good pinch the small amount of pain takes away from your other feelings.
z1i0tXd3aa	Unfortunately aspirin makes blood platelets, for the lack of a better word, slippery, it doesn't lower blood pressure.      Paramedics use nitroglycerin tablets, they cause your blood vessels to dilate and lower blood pressure, but that is dangerous and I would not do it.    The safest way I know is to take deep slow breaths (in through the nose and out through the mouth) for several minutes before the BP exam, in other words, just plain and simple relaxation techniques.  I have had the same problem with DOT and FAA physicals and the relaxation technique has worked for me.  Tell them you have "White Coats" syndrome and it causes your BP to go up and ask if you can have a few minutes to relax.  Most MD's realize that you have a job riding on the results and with minor hypertension like yours, will give you the time for the deep breathing to work.    P.S.  If you are a smoker, don't smoke right before the test, that raises your BP, but don't wait till you have a nic fit either.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	Do it first thing in the morning. Your BP will be it's lowest, immediately after waking up. Take one aspirin before sleeping and after waking. No caffeine, cigarettes, salt or soda.|`|285c8243564acc36040f290206c3ff28aa	At 140/90 you should probably be on blood pressure medicine.  Right now, there are two things you can do: 1) No salt today at all.  That means no junk food, no fast food, probably no prepared foods; even bread has salt.  Fruits and vegetables are safe.  Second, when they're taking your blood pressure, picture yourself on a nice beach, relaxing, kicking back, enjoying life.  You can bring your BP down a bit just by thinking of beautiful relaxing things.|`|rog4GDgaaa	Know anyone with heart problems? take a blood pressure med or nitro tablet. May drop you on the floor from passing out- but will lower your blood pressure fast. Got some Viagra?  That might work, too.  Course... the physical might be a little awkward...    In all seriousness, relaxation, maybe Niacin (it causes a "flush" due to vasodilation- couldn't hurt to try).  Alcohol is also a vasodilator, but maybe not a good idea to show up with whiskey on the breath.  No caffeine, nicotine, salt, fat.      That's the best I can think of in that short of time.  In the long run- weight loss is best.|`|ncQosuOeaa	You should not be trying to lower your blood pressure just to get a job but to keep it low for your own health.  It is noted that when having a blood pressure test the results are high as the patient is anxious. I would like to say that you need to take three blood pressure readings, over a few weeks to determine the correct level.  Hypertension (high blood pressure) is the lower reading, diastolic.  Yours is 90, and anything above 90 is hypertension.   I would advise you to be honest with yourself for your health and lower your blood pressure by adopting a healthy lifestyle.  In saying this I do sympathise with you as you need to work as we all do,.If you want to pass the test then don't smoke or drink, or eat anything with salt in it.  I wish you all the best.

If so these are all symptoms of calcium deficiency ....... if you don't like drinking milk try drinking some organic rice milk fortified with calcium or eat more leafy and green vegies (rich in calcium) and eat more fresh fruit (also rich in calcium)........... try eating a carrott...... they are rich in calcium and a natural way to bust a headache.    Foods rich in magnesium will also help to alleviate headaches and migraines, nervous tension, stress, muscle twitching, constipation and help to lower high blood pressure .......... leafy and green vegies again..... also wholegrain breads and cereals like rice and fresh fish like tuna, sardines and salmon are rich in magnesium.    Iron deficieny can also cause nasty slapping headaches .......... other symptoms of iron deficiency anemia are paleness of skin, dizzy spells, excessive feelings of being cold, fatigue and exhaustion ....... eat more brown rice, lentils, oatmeal, lean meats, organic peanuts if this is the case.    Failing all that eat some of the white meat of the chicken ...... rich in vitamin B3 .......vitamin B3 has been shown to alleviate headaches and migraines ...... don't supplement with any of the B complex of vitamins individually though ........ if you choose to take a supplement, rather take them as a whole complex as they work best as a group... ie ~ B1, B2, B3, B5, B6 and B!2 and folic acid etc............ they'll help you to better deal with the everyday dose of stress we are all exposed to at some level.    Have you been drinking enough water?? You could just be dehydrated........ If not, drink up luv... your body needs at least 2 - 3 litres of water daily......... and ditch the sodas and pop if you drink any cos they'll dehydrate you terribly and wash out your B complex of vitamins ........ as will caffeine and alcohol.

Wherever you live you Have To Get A Job.  Go back to your old high school and see if you can get your diploma or GED.  And work anywhere.  It'll be tough getting back out into the world, but the sooner you force yourself out there, the easier it'll be.  You can do it.  You're obviously intelligent enough to make a life for yourself, you just have to take it a step at a time. Write out a list of goals and how to achieve them and you'll be surprised at what you can accomplish.  Take some job-search classes if you can find free ones, and take whatever job you can get.  Ask for help and push yourself, and you'll make it.  Good luck.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	There *are* options for you to  begin to gain independance.      Telephone your doctors surgery and ask for a home visit if you are too scared to go out alone in public.  Explain the situation, and ask to be referred to therapy/mental health services.    You could consider moving into a hostel or supported housing, where staff will help you to gradually become more independant and intergrate into society.  You may also have some control over which area you live in this way too.    When you're ready you could do some volunteer work.  You could start of slowing and increase your hours as your confidence builds.  It will be good for you and also look good on your CV when you feel ready to apply for paid work.    Good luck.|`|89fc809291d1b95a8d32164fe467ae3baa	Then I honestly think your mom is right.

If you don't do that right now, then you will grow up to be an old lady with 30 cats who can't support herself.   Don't blame the economy, go to monster.com or yahoo hotjobs and believe me there are jobs out there.     The biggest failure in life is to be afraid.

If you're thin, you likely have a high metabolic rate and if you increase what you eat to a point your body will adjust.    You don't want to just binge on doughnuts to get a bunch of calories. The quality does count- you want healthy weight, right?    A calorie dense food is not the same as junk. You can eat things that have mono or polyunsaturated fats, like nuts, avocados, etc and get some calories that way without all the junk.  Weights isn't a bad idea- but you need to beef up what you eat to match.  If you really can't muscle down the extra food try supplemental shakes like ensure (kind of gross) or if you start exercising Muscle Milk or similar to get extra protein and calories to help support building muscle. But don't forget- carbs (good carbs) are essential for sparing proteins so try to get some good whole grains, whole wheat pastas, etc for that as well.    Your input must exceed the output.  I wouldn't try to gain more than 1 lb per week- it's 3500 calories per pound of fat so if you gain one pound per week it's 500 calories MORE than your burn every day.      Check out the Bodybugg if you can afford it. It helps show what you burn so you can gauge your diet and activity around it. The website also gives nutrition and activity tips tailored to your goals.    Good luck.

Borderline Personality Disorder - People with BPD don't really know who they are (that;s what I've heard anyway). They will see themselves as certain one day, but then another way the next day. Their goals, friendships, self image, and views of others will change frequently too. They also get extremely angry very easily. The rage that someone with borderline is so intense, I can't even begin to describe it. They don't like being smothered by someone, but yet they have an intense fear of someone abandoning them or leaving them and will do anything to make that person stay.     http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/borderl...

Granted, it was easier when I actually enjoyed my job and looked forward to going to work.    One thing I did when I worked days, which gave me a bit of an edge on it, was to go to sleep very early.  I'd go home, eat dinner, relax for an hour or so, maybe go to the gym, and be in bed by nine.  I didn't have to get up until 7, so I had a full 10 hrs.  After a while, I would be up by 5, and actually started working out in the mornings instead.  Maybe give that a try.|`|eeb898bd256e45f62aa2f9354d7b958baa	Drink a full glass of water before you go to bed. The urge to 'go' can help you get going in the morning with that first trip.    Set multiple alarm clocks in different parts of your house.  This will wake everyone up to come harass you.  Keep your own clock out of reach and resist the snooze button.

wic0XXx7aa	Don't freak out too much yet! I know how you feel. When I was 15-16, I was in rehab for methamphetamine. It freaking sucked! We couldn't do anything w/o having our res techs supervision. I don't know how it worked where you went or what kind of rehab center you attended, but I attended a rehab center that was VERY VERY strict, organized and well structured. We had chores, daily activities, school, and meetings to help us maintain structure and sobriety for when we graduated and were released. Something that helped me when I got out was to stay in a constant routine. I got up at the same time every day, I made my bed and cleaned my room every morning..I did stuff like that to keep me busy and keep everything in order for me. My parents drove me crazy. They were constantly accusing me of doing drugs and lying even though I wasn't. Just try talking to them, or as I did, writing them a note explaining how you feel and let them know that you are trying your best to get your life together while maintaining your sobriety. Tell them that it is stressful and overwhelming. Unless your parents have experienced what it is like to be an addict or alcoholic, then they don't know what you are going through or how you feel. Let them know. I don't know what continuation high school is, but I attended night school. I went from 1-7:30 Mondays-Thursdays. Only 2 classes a day & we went by 5 week terms. So every 5 weeks we were able to earn a total of 1 full credit. Idk if yall have something like that out where you live but you should check into it. It is also called Extended Day School. Prozac made me crazy! I don't know if you want to be on something to help you, but I know I have to. I'm currently on Wellbutrin 450mg. I really like it. It made me much more motivated than I had been prior to taking it. For sleeping, I take ambien. I don't know if you would be able to take that, but I would ask. Take Tylenol PM if you don't/can't take ambien. Idk what else to tell you, but I know how you feel. Remember, live your life one day at a time. Don't stress yourself out over anything, its not worth it. I didn't keep my sobriety long after I got out, but Im sober now..It's a struggle that I will have to deal w/ for the rest of my life. If you need anything else or want to talk, I am here! I would say more, but I keep running my mouth!|`|B24W8w43aa	Don't get yourself into a frenzy.

Now just remember you are only seventeen, you have gone through a lot already.  You have to find yourself, find what makes you happy this won't happen overnight and it can be a great adventure so just relax.  Go for walks in nature and just breathe.  Make a routine and stick to it.    The foods people eat are not as safe as people think, and all the additives and preservatives have been known to affect certain people in very bad ways, like depression and anxiety.  Seeing you had an addiction your body might react to these things in a sensitive way.  Don't eat processed foods, definitely no taqke out! eat as much organic as you can and grass fed beef and free range chicken. lots of fruits and veggies.  Surround yourself with positive people and stay away from negative people and situations.   Trust takes a long time to get back. always be honest with your parents even if they don't believe you. As long as you  keep being honest one day they'll believe you again.  They have good reason not to trust.  I'm sure they have been hurt also.  Just focus on being righteous, being honest. You know you are telling the truth.  You will have to live with yourself forever, not your parents, so always be honest with yourself first and formost.   Watching The Secret might help you get through the day. You can usually find it at the library but I am sure your parents would get it for you.    GO TO BED on time! If you can't sleep try Dr. Jeffrey Thompson's Sleepy ocean and Sleepy Rain CDs. put them on repeat and turn off everything in you room.  close your eyes and do nothing but listen to them for an hour.   Exercise.  Join a gym and do some cardio. Maybe martial arts or some hip hop aerobics, whatever is your taste.     make a collage of the positive things you want in your future and hang it up on the wall.  make a list of all the things you need to do like check out colleges, clean room, organize papers etc and cut them individually. put them in a bowl and just grab one thing a day to do.  One thing at a time.

u8CFwtyMaa	There's nothing wrong, somebody has to be bigger than average.  You probably don't have too much growing to do now, you just need to find ways to cover it. Can you wear swim shorts? those may help.  Sorry that I can't be more helpful, but I have no personal experience of that particular problem, if you see what I mean.  You say your foreskin is tight, you can try to stretch it.  Do it in the bath or shower - the hot water helps to soften the skin.  Insert a clean finger under the foreskin, and gently pull it - don't do it so much that it hurts, as this can cause micro tears, that then heal with scars - not what you want.  It will take several weeks before you see any results, but keep it up daily and you'll get there  Pulling the foreskin back whenever you pee will help, as will masturbating.  Hope this helps|`|PpKJIT0aaa	You might have to ditch the Speedos in favour of swim trunks.     As for your size, well, it's not easy because you are pretty much in the same boat as someone who is on the very small side; you both get teased about it. Thing is, you just have to suck it up and get on with life. You're gonna get hassled no matter what, so you can either let it get to you, or ignore it, or make a joke (like 'oh yeah, I DO keep my walking stick with me all the time).     7.5" flaccid IS big. There's no denying it, but what your mates don't realise is that it can be as frustrating to you, as too short is for someone else. It's not like you can get a refund, and start over.

You might not want to eat if you're feeling nauseous, but the food might actually help with that, and in the long run it will make you feel better.  Chamomile tea is also really great if you have any; tea in general is good for feeling icky and chamomile especially is great for settling stomachs.  If you've got some Pamprin or Midol, I'd take that (I'm assuming your cramps are from your period), and if not, Tylenol or Advil, something like that.  Also for your cramps and the fact that you're cold, sit with a hot compress on your stomach (if you don't have anything like that, try to entice a pet to sit on your lap against your tummy!) until you have to leave for school, if you've got one, and if you have any/can get some for the future, Therma-Care heat pads are great--they stick on the inside of your underwear so that they rest against your tummy and provide heat all day long, which is very comforting.  Oh, and also for the nausea, peppermint is great, so if you're still feeling nauseous by the time you have to leave, stuff some peppermint candies in your pocket if you have some, and suck on one on the way there.    Hope you feel better!|`|IHw2qUtcaa	Go to bed..

zMNgG9m0aa	I can't wait til my girls are in their teens so I can help them through this stuff. what a shame your mum doesn't feel the same! So, in the mean time let me be of some help, as I can absolutely relate to you as this is exactly what happened to me. My mum wouldn't let me shave in primary school, and when I started grade 8 she "forgot" she'd promised I could shave my legs then. One day I got picked on so I went home and just shaved them. I then had to spend a few months hiding my legs from her, and one day the neighbour commented on how smooth and nice and young my legs looked (really! some ppl should just shut up!!) and then of course mum found out... but it was all ok.     So I think you're old enough, go for it!  BUT, here's what i'm telling my daughters now...  you can have hairfree legs from whatever age you like, but you are NOT going to shave, you will only get them waxed.   Waxing is the best, I wish I'd started earlier (a friend convinced me to try it when I was 20). Please don't try to wax them yourself, you need to have them done properly a few times so you know how it works and what to do. (do not go to some cheap place either, you want a senior beauty therapist for your first session, don't forget that!)  After that you can easily do it yourself at home to save money. But you'll obviously have to talk to your mum about this.  If you are brave enough an underarm wax from the beginning is so much better than a lifetime of shaving armpits. Mine are too strong now to even consider waxing, but I wish I'd started them too at 20.    At some point you're going to have to learn how to have these conversations with your mum. I know it's hard, but just take a deep breath and go for it! She loves you more than you love her, and if you convey all these feelings to her she will want to help you.|`|brSfRLspaa	when you feel like, no reason to ask your mom|`|6w8jfI7Uaa	Well, shaving your armpits- you really should, especially if you have dark hair.   I know how you feel about your mum as mine is the same. Just tell her that you are going to start shaving your legs and do it. if you dont know how to, there are instructions on shaving foam and more on yahoo answers.  Shaving your legs- Possibly but not as important as armpits.|`|3JLg1tcRaa	If you feel comfortable shaving your legs and armpits, then do so.  You'd be surprised with how your mom will probably be open to talking about it.  Just remember to go real slow so you don't cut yourself... and in order to get all the hair from your armpits effectively you should shave up down right and left... and the hair will get more coarse over time.. like darker and harder... and remember to change your razors often... and use a soft soap or shaving cream, other wise you'll get razor burn, and that's no fun!|`|OdLj07Svaa	i'd just start shaving its ur choice not hers ur armpits are more important so start with them n then ur legs just ask her to get u some razors|`|ccZuEOEfaa	Begin shaving your armpits now, that's definitely where you should start.  Then, instead of shaving your legs, you could try other options like depilatory creams or waxing (if you don't mind a bit of pain!). If you really want to shave your legs, do some research before you start, to find out where you can get things like shaving gel/foam, razors etc.  It would be good if you could try to talk to your mum about it, because I'm sure she went through the same thing when she was your age.  If you start shaving I recommend a razor that you don't need to use shaving foams with - I've just started using a Schick Intuition razor and I'm finding it much quicker and easier than using a normal razor with a shaving foam. Here's their website: http://www.schickintuition.com/  And lastly, just remember that you don't have to shave your legs. I know a lot of girls who don't and no one really cares. But everyone shaves their armpits, so start there.  I wish you the best of luck. ??|`|abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	You can start now... if you ask me.|`|UXuSI6EZaa	get help from your friends, then show your mom after, then ask her to get you your own razor. she'll understand. good luck|`|2fvfjmEwaa	well it depends i starting shaving then too if you want to shave then go out and buy some shaving or waxing stuff for yourself or just ask your mum to get some just before she goes shopping. its not really that big a deal in the puberty section compared to other things. x

If you are old enough to play house, you need to take responsibility for your education.    If he is ill enough that he is unable to care for himself and needs nursing, then that is a good reason.    In senior years of schooling there is often a limit in time that you can miss and still pass.  If you waste this unnecessarily, you may not have any time you can take off if you get sick yourself, or he is ill enough to warrant you staying home.
qBkJAlQ1aa	Nah..I would not be too quick giving diagnosis. for one, she's doing better at her mother's place. I think, being at home after delivery of the baby, taking care of so much chores, like it never gonna end, then never having enough time for herself, would really make anyone feel like a failure. That will surely make one sad. Hey, ask yourself, how we'll have you appreciated the work she do at home. How well have you listened to her thoughts. I say listen not hear. Were you able to reassure her importance to you and the child. Did you really attended to her emotional, physical and other needs. Did you give her a break from the monotonous house chores.     Hmmnn, just my two cents worth......|`|AA10423276	yea she sounds depressed. donno if its post partum depression but since it started after child birth (i'm assuming she was a very happy go lucky person before child birth) then you should take it very seriously and take her to a doctor immediately. it might be that she was not really ready for so much responsibility and sleep less nights so she got a bad surprise. and since she finds it hard to take care of the baby, she's thinking she's a bad mom. maybe thats why she's happier at her mom's house coz her mom is probably helping her quite a bit and letting her rest, sleep etc. in that case, she's not seriously depressed. coz women effected by PPD don't just get better by change of scenery or change of environment. PPD stems from a hormonal imbalance in the brain so it cannot go away without medicine. many of my friends who gave birth got a bit depressed after wards when they were taking care of the baby. thats totally normal coz most of them had no help taking care of the baby. the onez living with moms or mom in law got lots of help from them and in turn got more time for themselves. being a mom doesn't automatically make you a super human you know. you still need time for your self, grooming, lots of sleep, rest and funnnn etc. so i'm sure a lotttt of new moms go through frequent phases of depression. for complete evaluation, ask her if she'd like to see a therapist. good luck!|`|TCJQEUbXaa	PPD is pretty serious, if you suspect it you should speak with your wife about getting help, if that isn't an option look for local support groups in the area or therapists that deal with PPD.  I have links to doulas, birth support, etc: http://skyyogastudio.com|`|7jxbpo0Qaa	Definitely depression or some form of mental problems.  Could be induced by recently having baby or just magnified due to increase in responsibility.  PPD ain't no joke...for real.  get her to a medical dr., then a therapist, if needed.  GL and great that u are helping out.  Give a real man a hug!|`|wnoGTIzuaa	Ask her if she is depressed.  many people are relieved you have brought up the topic.  Also look for changes in sleeping or eating patterns and loss of enjoyment in life.  Give her lots of support and love.  props for caring :)

So even if you were to walk for an hour a day it will take you almost 3 months just too loose 1 kg of fat. Also you can not take of fat from a certain body part by working out that part particularly. I am telling you all this from my own personal experience i was a little over 100 kgs , and trust me at that time in desperation i have bought anything and every thing that claims to make you loose weight. Non of them really did what they promised. I then learn t from my own research that then only way to loose fat quickly and permanently is by working out and eat healthy, that when i came across the X - MELT program from X attack its a in home based training program , with tons of fun workouts to do at home itself with out any equipment and also custom made nutrition plans by some hot shot nutritionist. Its highly effective healthy weight loss program. I came down to 78 kgs in 3 months of this program. The best thing i liked about this program is the amount of knowledge their staff has to offer, also how they weren't just interested in having to loose weight but also give my body a great shape for the first time in my life. I as a happy client of theirs will totally recommend this program to anyone looking forward to loosing weight. Here is their URL if you want to have a look at their website for more info.

I am sure  u will be successful if u did it daily morning in empty stomach...|`|JmVP5ECQaa	I copy this clip for you from a web site:  I'm going to introduce to you what does work by telling you a real quick story about two women that I personally witnessed make spectacular changes in their bodies by trying something drastically different than what they had done in the past.    You see, as a Certified Nutrition Specialist & Certified Personal Trainer, I've trained hundreds of women over the last 10 years in person... and that doesn't even count the thousands of women that have used my programs online over the last few years since I've become an internationally recognized fitness expert.      This isn't about me though, this is about you getting the fat loss and tummy sculpting results you've always wanted, and what you can learn from 2 very different women... Stephanie and Margo.    Stephanie and Margo are 27 and 59 years old respectively.  I use them as examples because of their age differences, yet both of them achieving very similar results... and inspiring results at that!  When they first came to me, they were spewing a lot of the same old negative beliefs about their body that I see so many women have... they would say things such as:    "Oh, I'll never lose weight... my metabolism is shot and just way too slow!"    or    "I'll just have to accept my flabby body the way it is because with my genetics, I'll never get a flat stomach."    or    "I've tried everything and nothing works... I'm doomed to have this pooch-belly and love handle rolls for life!"    or    "I just don't have time to get in shape... it's just impossible for me with my busy schedule... I should just give up."        The fact is... they both proved ALL of these beliefs DEAD WRONG!  And so have thousands of other women that changed their mindset, their workout techniques, and their nutrition habits drastically from their old habits that weren't working.     Stop Making It Harder on Your Body  and Start Working WITH Your Body  Think about this... if what you've been doing all these years hasn't been getting you the results you want, doing more of that same thing won't get you any further!  If doing 4 hours of cardio a week hasn't worked for you, why do you believe that doing 7 hours of cardio will?    If doing 100 crunches a day hasn't gotten you the results you want, why do you think that doing 200 crunches a day will?  Of course you remember that doing the same things over and over and expecting different results is the definition of insanity!    The truth is that all of these techniques are WRONG and ineffective ways to workout.  In fact, doing excessive cardio is actually working against your results because you are stimulating excessive cortisol production in your body and breaking down lean muscle tissue... all of which leads to the slowing down of your metabolic rate over time and deposition of even more belly fat on top of what you already have.    Also, wasting most of your workout time with ineffective abs exercises such as crunches, situps, and torso twists actually goes directly against your fat loss efforts as well.  You see, the time you waste with doing all of these fairly ineffective abs exercises, is really just keeping you from doing the truly effective full body exercise combinations that actually stimulate your fat burning hormones and increase your metabolic rate for as much as 24-48 hours after each workout.  You don't get that with "ab workouts" or "cardio"!    When you get these types of full body metabolic-surge workouts right, the excess belly fat starts to melt off quicker than you ever could have imagined.  Yes, it IS going to take a little work though. You're not going to be able to just be lazy and sit on the couch every day hoping for your dream body to come true.

The amount of muscle a person has is a very strong determinant in the ability to burn calories and shed fat. So it goes without saying that exercise is essential. Build strength and resistance by working out at least twice a week, preferably with weights. Do easy exercises in between workouts. Simple tasks such as walking the dog and using the stairs in place of the elevator can already take off calories. The key is to match the amount of eating to the amount of activity one has. Here are some guidelines in getting the right exercise:    For strength training    -Increase the amount of repetitions of a particular exercise.  -Add the level of resistance  -Utilize advance exercise techniques if possible    For cardiovascular training    -Insert intervals between exercises  -Perform cross-training and combine the exercises  -Add up on resistance and speed      2. Eat breakfast. A lot of people are ignoring the fact that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Surprisingly, the ones who eat breakfast are thinner than the ones who do not. Metabolism can slow down considerably if breakfast is taken during mid-morning or if one waits until the afternoon to eat.    3. Avoid sugar. Sugar enables the body to store fat. It is recommended that a person consumes food that helps sustain an even level of blood-sugar. Additionally, progressive execerise 2-3 times a week should be in order to stabilize blood sugar.    4. Eat spicy foods. Hot cuisine with peppers can increase metabolism.    5. Sleep more. According to research, it is riskier for people who do not get enough sleep to gain weight. Also, muscles are regenerated during the last couple of hours of slumber.    6. Increase water intake. Water flushes out toxins that are produced whenever the body burns fat. Majority of bodily functions involves water, and lack of water causes the body system's operations to decrease its speed, and produces unneeded stress as a result.    7. Eat smaller meals. It is advisable to consume 4 to 6 small meals that are timed 2 to 3 hours apart.    8. Never skip meals. People tend to skip meals in order to lose weight, which is a big mistake since it slows down metabolism.    9. Plan meals in detail. Always prepare the right amount of food to be consumed at the designated intervals. Do not commit the mistake of eating meals in sporadic patterns.    9. Ditch the stress! Stress, be it physical or emotional, triggers the release of a steroid called cortisol, which decreases metabolism. Also, people tend to eat excessively when stressed.    10. Guzzle up on green tea. It can be used as a substitute for coffee. Tea has the ability to stimulate metabolism, and unlike coffee, it has no undesirable side effects when too much is consumed.    11. Include more energy foods in the diet, such as fruits and vegetables, beans and whole grains.    Achieving the desired body weight is never impossible if one has the determination and patience needed to stabilize the metabolism level, which plays an important role in weight loss. A person needs to realize that eating right and working out is not just a passing fancy, but a way of life.|`|2gtZsrJ3aa	Positive Attitude To Weight Loss    Once you have determine in your mind to lose weight, you need to make positive commitment and work on it.

7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	At your age, I wouldn't be too worried.    If you have a particularly luxurious growth, then you may try trimming a little before wearing a bathing suit if you find you have hair showing.  Try trimming neatly with scissors before you try shaving as it is less likely to cause skin irritation/itch/rash and grows out softer.  Trimming with scissors first also makes it easier th shave if you do decide to go down that path.  Once you become sexually active, you may decide to start shaving, it should be about whatever you prefer.  Personally I always feel that men who prefer girls who shave to extremes are closet pedophiles!  Having suffered total hair loss during chemotherapy, I found intercourse was not as pleasant, hair provides a bit of cushioning!  Some men prefer shaved women, some like them with hair, you should do what YOU prefer.  Shower/wash regularly so the area is clean and fresh (try using a tiny amount of shampoo and conditioner) and there is no need to shave.|`|eI9mkxS5aa	It's annoying and itchy (I know this sounds disgusting coming from a guy)  Use some sort of soothing cream.. like a shaving gel or something. shave with the direction of hair not against it, shaving against it will make it itchy and it will make some annoying spots as hair tries to regrow and rise from below the skin.|`|DtUpcdXwaa	Well, if you want to shave it's totally your decision.

I know when i was 14 (5 years ago), many guys would take the piss out of anyone with hair. But it's totally up to you. Don't listen to assholes.      And men who like shaved do not have paedo tendecies. That's utter bull. It's just nicer.

If the question is, should you shave it all, then no you should NOT.    why does society now demand us women to look like 10 year old girls "down there" ?!! it is bizarre.    I do agree a manicured garden is very nice. I get a great gstring wax that leaves a "landing strip" (the beautician's term, not mine!) which can be trimmed neatly as often as you like. a wax like that lasts me 2-3 weeks and I have the added benefit of slower/fewer/softer hair regrowth. Shaving is itchy as it regrows and horribly spiky too.    I once had a brazillian. firstly, OW. secondly, OW. i also felt like every secretion from my body just sat on my skin and it was so gross. the hair is there for a reason and does help. I didn't feel sexy, I felt vulnerable and stupid, a bit like being a teen all over again, it was not a good feeling!|`|RjSHyjzPaa	u can try waxing,shaving or any hair removal creams.

AA11522944	It is perfectly normal NOT to be able to retract your foreskin when you are a child. When you are an infant the foreskin is actually attached to the glans (head) of your penis and naturally detaches itself somewhere between the age of 5 and 10.      Once the foreskin is naturally detached from the glans it should be retractable. Check out the pics in the link below which shows how a foreskin retracts once detached from the glans.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:A_For...  About 5% of males cannot retract their foreskin by the age of 17.    Even when the foreskin is fully retractable there should still be a strip of skin called the 'frenulum' attached underneath... this never detaches. See the following link.  http://www.foreskin.org/frenulum.htm     If the foreskin is detached from the glans of your penis but is not fully retractable you may have a tight foreskin- a condition known as Phimosis.    Phimosis is not uncommon and often resolves itself through puberty as the normal practice of masturbation stretches the foreskin to the point where it retracts fully. To stretch your foreskin simply try to retract it a little more each time you shower, urinate or masturbate. Otherwise you can do stretching exercises as describe in the links below.    You should NEVER force a tight foreskin back when you are erect or hold it back prior to becoming erect. Forcing or holding the foreskin back can hurt and cause injury including Paraphimosis where the tight foreskin restricts blood flow to the glans.      If your foreskin is very tight, is not stretching or loosening over time, or feels firmly attached to the head of your penis you should see a doctor.  A doctor can prescribe steroid creams which assist with the stretching process.    In extreme cases of phimosis circumcision might be recommended but this is usually a last resort.     Check out the links below  http://www.andrologyaustralia.org/docs/F...  http://xsorbit28.com/users5/foreskinforu...  http://www.geocities.com/restoremaine/ti...  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phimosis  http://www.fathermag.com/health/boy-care...  http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...  http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...|`|MQE7iVHcaa	It's supposed be attached at a place called the frenulum which is found on the underside of the penis.

Google 'skin bridge', and look at the photos, if  yours is like that, you may have to see a doctor.

Such as:    Dump any friends who are faux friends for good.  Keep friends who have your best interest at heart.  And keep up your end of the friendship by being a good friend.  TRUE friendships enhance your self esteem.    Stay away from trash tv.  If you watch Jerry Springer type shows you start to relate.  If you're watching reality tv, watch something like biggest loser or shows where you see positive goals.    Listen to music with positive lyrics ! This is an important one as music works your brain subconsciously.  If you repeat something long enough your brain will take it in.  Find a song you like that expresses you are good or makes you feel powerful,ect.  And sing your heart out! :)    Volunteer for anything you are interested in.  In giving thy shall receive.  It's a heart warmer/esteem builder to know that you have something to contribute to the world.    Get your blood pumping.  Any type of physical activity releases endorphins-- feel good enhancers.    Talk to yourself with RESPECT.  If you make a mistake do not say, "I'm so stupid", simply say, "I can fix that" or "redo".  Don't compare yourself to those who you think are better at something prettier etc, in a negative way. Don't get bogged down in jealousies.   Think of them as inspiration and motivators and know that you can acheive whatever you put your mind, heart into.  Usually with work, but that's the gratification of working hard, enjoying the process and seeing results.    At night before bed, think of all the things you are GRATEFUL for in your life. Writing them down helps.  Even if it was a lousy day, their is tons to be appreciative about.  Such as the fact that you are you, and the sun rose that day, and night falls and tomorrow will bring another day for you to shine your inner light.

She was constantly feeling dizzy and the room would spin and she would complain of nausea also.

I have a fiance who gets up for work early so that helps. I have someone to talk to in the morning.

For those who are wondering why hops would increase breast size, hops are one source of potent phyto-estrogens, or plant-derived substances that are similar in structure to estrogens (hormones that make a woman a woman).    At least one identified phytoestrogen in hops is 8-prenylnaringenin, which has also been identified as being able to reverse the "hot flash" (or flush) effect experienced in menopause.    Hops also have recently been found to contain an anticarcinogen (cancer preventative) called xanthohumol. Along with inhibiting tumor growth and other enzymes that activate cancer cells, it also helps the body make unhealthy compounds more water-soluble, so they can be excreted.    Currently hops have gone up in price, so many beers have been reformulated to contain less.|`|vGxipYJnaa	Sorry but there's really no way to do that. Your breast size is determined by your genes.

Once you forgiven yourself those things - then you are really almost "free and fair" already ;o)|`|UnE1cycJaa	just eat a lot!|`|Ahg074zcaa	there isn't really anything you can do about it... unless u either A. get a padded bra, or B. stuff ur bra... but don't do that unless ur majorly insecure about ur size.....    good luck =]  xSpl@|`|df39fcfac3f454931e49c6267da0992eaa	Not without damaging your health.

They are herbs that you can find in a vitamin store.  Just take the recommended amount to be safe, but both help promote blood flow to that area.  And they are both phytoestrogens which means if your body stopped growing earlier than perhaps your full potential, it can help you get back on track.  But it takes time and consistency to be effective.  Do your own research, but many have had success with that. Good Luck|`|TGtgMu8eaa	Dont no how old u are!

If they are really really small, and it's going to ruin your life then you can only consider surgery at some point.  If they are just small and cute then get a good bra and get on with life. Find clothes that flatter your shape, halter necks are good for making boobs look bigger. Small boobs are a blessing and you'll be so happy after you've had children that your boobs aren't at your belly button like some of friends'. I know that's small help now. You've just got to find a way to be happy in your own skin.     I have seen pills you can take that supposedly increase bust size but I suspect you have to constantly take them, but how safe are they?

IUQZFrMfaa	oh i really don't know. i've been getting the same thing, i've never had it either. but i'm just naturally dizzy a lot, so that's nothing new. but yeah, i'm having the cough, stuffiness, headache, and my voice is on and off.i'm not sure what it is. it could be bronchitis, but you didn't say anything about your throat, so idk. or the flu, or strep. but it could be a number of things so i would go to the doctor.
7jxbpo0Qaa	Ask him to just let u try one.. at a very small dose.  If u truly feel it would benefit u...go to another dr.  Not know what u r on,  but probably those 2 types of meds are contraindicated (not to be taken together).  Both slow ur heart rate...ADD meds. are stimulants which act as depressants when given to a person with or ADD or ADHD.    Have u had diagnosis of ADD?  If not, that needs to happen first b4 u take meds for it.|`|il9Tdmchaa	I have the same thing except my doctor put me on a non-stimulant med (provigil) for the add. It's working amazingly well. Perhaps that could be an option for you. Otherwise see if he'll put you on a very low dose of a stimulant medication but if you're doing so well I'd avoid them. Best of luck.|`|RmO46Wb2aa	I was diagnosed with ADHD, bipolar disorder type 2, a general social anxiety disorder, not to mention insomnia.    I am on Adderall XR for my ADHD, Wellbutrin XL for my depression, Lamictal to even out the mania and Ambien for sleep. I had previous substance abuse problems so I was a bit worried about a stimulant, but I love Adderall. I'm doing very well in college.    You could try Stratera. It is a non stimulant drug for ADD/ADHD.     I've been on Concerta aswell for my ADHD with no positive results.

jX0qR85waa	It sound like you have a swollen lymph node.  This could be an infection from just about anything. (throat, ear, nose, tooth, sinus)  If it has been bothering you for some time I would definitely go to the Doctor.  For the lymph nodes to properly work in the body, they must flow.   Before you go to the Doctor have a cup of hot water with lemon and honey, it will make you feel better.  A tooth infection is hard to detect.  Please do not delay and see a doctor.  You can wear your body down and that isn't necessary.  Listen to your body. Good luck.  Peace.|`|b21d22e3da7866088f52dd8851a9cc95aa	tooth infection any oral infections will eventually become ear problems|`|hcORMcOwaa	It sounds to me like you have a swollen gland under your ear, I have had that before as well. This typically means your body to trying to fight something off a virus, infection etc... If it keeps up I would check with you doctor but if it's just been off and on for a couple days I wouldn't worry too much now. I know they are really sore to touch. Hope you feel better soon!    It can be from more then just your teeth. It could be from anything your body is fighting. Try not to stress out too much. I get them quite often but I just think of it as a good thing that my body is fighting all the bad stuff so I don't have to. I get nervous too when something isn't right but in this case I can totally relate and you will be fine. Like I said though you should call your doc if it isn't better by Monday.
NTln9ULUaa	First, get the book Allan Carr's The Easy way to Stop Smoking.     The brain washing that the tobacco companies have done to smokers is incredible. The "cravings" and "withdrawal" that you are experiencing will pass.    Withdrawal from a cigarette begins the moment that you butt out and will be at it's peak about 45 minutes later. It isn't debilitating. It is much like a hunger pang.     So if you haven't had your morning cigarette, you should have suffered withdrawal last night. Smoking is an addiction, we just have to re-wire our brains to think that way.    It's not a habit, oral fixation, keep us occupied, something to do when we are bored.    Our bodies know that smoking is poison. Do you remember the first cigarette you ever had? How you choked while you tried to inhale? That is your body saying, this is poison! Keep it out of me.|`|nYRkAmdtaa	good luck , you have the right to shout , you have gone without this morning , so you are just building on that . good luck.|`|53d173cf8196283c2c28f9c0efc29f92aa	I found that cold turkey was the only way for me, but I have a friend who swears by nicotine patches. He kept kept extending the times between putting new ones on and made it that way.   Think of the craving as an itch that is only going to get way worse if you scratch it.   I had a full box of fags around the house for a full year after, just so's I wouldn't start panicking. There is a reflex point under your nose which helps you to relax when you press it. You might have to experiment a bit, but you will feel the effect after a few seconds once you got the right spot.    Best of luck!|`|MfmCH8Abaa	good luck!! i packed in for a year and could smell a cigg from a mile away|`|cbp7Gukbaa	Nicotine isnt a friend its an enemy so treat it like one|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	get either the nicotine patches or the gum they may help|`|GutYNu9baa	Stick at it, yes, it is withdrawal systems from nicotine.|`|AA12312108	whatever you do, don't beat yourself for relapsing. keep your mind and your hands occupied. commit yourself to a psychologically stimulating event. oh, i don't know... answers for instance. do a lot of typing. concentrate on work, and ask non-smoking co-workers to hang out every now and then. for the first couple of months, don't pick up hobbies that require idle time; like jigsaw puzzles; at least not more than 20 pieces; if you have a favorite bar, play darts or pool so the hands and eyes concentrate on something. and for the nic fits, there's always special gum. this is coming from a guy that went through it, almost a year ago; minus 26 days.
OYG711kraa	Is is an approach that he still responds to and learn from?  If so, then no, he's not too old.    If it only makes him rebellious, then his folks should find another means of teaching him whatever lesson he needs to learn.    In the context of a loving family, spanking can be appropriate under the circumstances.  Depending on the nature of the "crime," of course.  Forget to clear the dishes after dinner?  Don't spank, but maybe disallow TV for the evening.  Out too late and no call home?  That might be a time for the belt to be put to use.|`|oluB6ClPaa	well.. he is too old.. but if he gets spanked for th right reasons and not too hard it's okay.. but he's parents should just like... talk to him.|`|e8yt5PrGaa	Bro that is an excellent question and the honest answer is Yes   Yes ..he is too old to be spanked .. The same way  that is he too old to be stood in a corner or given a time out ..spanking a 14 year old is a childish thing to do ..  --------------------------------------...  ( TO JIM ..It belongs in the mens health section because we are talking about young men )  --------------------------------------...  A 14 year old boy does need discipline but he needs to be embraced and reasoned with ..it is a very difficult age and i dont have to explain what i mean by that im sure you know ..You guys need the upmost patience and understanding ..    Now what i would do if i were youre friend's dad or guardian is try to reason with him with love and compassion and i would have a reward system set up so that instead of punishments he would not be rewarded so he learns that good behavior has its benefits and bad behavior forfeits those benefits ..But would i spank him at 14 for any thing that he did ..Well ..i would make it clear to him that i think its childish and i dont want to do it ..it would embarass me as much as it would embrarass him ..but if he acts unreasonably and insists on being unreasonable then i would spank him ..but let me put it to you this way he would have to do something extremely bad before i would spank him at 14 ...    So to answer youre question spanking a 14 year old should be looked on as just a s rare as a one eyed billy goat wearing an abe lincoln top hat ..listening to Jay Z on an ipod in the back of a pick up truck in the middle of manhatten ..|`|AA11522944	yep|`|2OO9U8o9aa	A lot depends on what you mean by spanked as that can range from a quick slap on his legs to serious assault . If he feels he is being assaulted then he should contact Childline   When I was young I got the occasional "spanking" but it was normally a slap on the backside when I stepped out of line and never any more than that and only my dignity was hurt|`|a8e2130188e45facab4c16a4a764104caa	Why was this posted under "Men's Health"?    Does your friend still "deserve" to get punished?  Does your friend know his parents' love and affection 24/7/365?    Then if he "earns" punishment, yes, spanking is a form of punishment.  Other than that it is quite unpleasant at the time, what is all that wrong with a RARE bare belting of the butt? [IMO at his age it should be by his dad and not by his mom.]    Maybe he prefers "spanked" to "grounded"?    The kind of authority our folks have over me, it is an authority grounded in their love for me and I don't even want to "rebel" and can't even imagine I'd "fight back one day". Of course I don't .like getting "spanked" but even almost worse is saying or doing something that so disappoints them that they feel I need another session with the belt.    How do your folks punish you when you "deserve" it?  .|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Yup. But it might depend on what kind of authority his folks have over him. IF they run a tight ship, he might be too scared to rebel, but if they don't, they might want to be careful he doesn't fight back one day.|`|Qs0x3x2Vaa	hell yes big *** YES|`|cr2KKT6Naa	if thats all he understands. and his parents cant seem to  reason with him. in 4 years someones going to jail in that house.|`|Qd8aqvVuaa	absolutely YES    when they start growing pubes....theyre too old!|`|yfytMbnSaa	Sounds kind of hawt.

vGxipYJnaa	I don't think your dance instructor will be mad at you. I think she will be worried again. What you're experiencing is pretty normal - body image is a tough thing to deal with especially in your teens. You need to take the advice or your dance teacher though - if you stop eating, you'll do damage to your body and could end up actually gaining weight in the long run. Dance is great exercise - so keep that up. Perhaps what you're eating isn't the best - I'm sure your dance teacher would be happy to help you learn what you should be eating.     It's okay to cry - everyone has bad days and you'll feel better again soon. Talk to someone if you feel like it - if not, just curl up and cry until you feel better.|`|b5ySK6SGaa	Try not to worry their alot of comforting people on yahoo answers.

Cheer up talk to someone close about how your feeling and have hug.|`|Gt3hRAA1aa	You fall within the average weight category as far as my calculations of pounds into stones go so you really have nothing to worry about. I think that you probably go to this dance thing and feel insecure because maybe the other girls are really skinny But in the long term you'll realise that it actually is good to have a figure of some kind. You're not fat so stop worrying. As far as the crying thing goes, when you're emotional anyway, to even think about lost loved ones is painful, we all do it all the time. Concentrate on good thngs that happened, allow yourself to smile, have a nice healthy snack and take it from there!|`|7jxbpo0Qaa	Anorexia..not eating, is a serious condition.

Many do have mental illnesses, but not all.  I don't think it is the easy way out either-I just think they do not see a choice.  If we start saying that they are brave or it is cowardly, then that is saying that the person is capable of making a logical decision and that they see a choice.  They don't see a choice-they only see what they perceive to be their only way out.  Also, if you think of the hell they must go through before they do it, how can that be classified as easy? Interesting question-have a star.|`|UP8ApwsZaa	most people who kill themselves regret it at the last second, my cousin and uncle recently committed suicide and you have to have a lot of will power to be able to perform such an awful act|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	A lot of people decide it is the only way out and they give a lot of thought to it.

Id be terrified to actually try to kill myself.  I guess you really do go a bit "crazy" to think that death is the best option bc really it leaves you with no option. One would have to feel utterly hopeless, helpless and alone.|`|H7z2uUG0aa	As for the first person who responded, how do you know they regretted it if they are dead? Secondly, people don't kill themselves because they are crazy; they usually do it because they are severely depressed and are suffering see no other way out. Check out Darkness Visible, by William Styron, about his battle with depression. He is a great author and does an excellent job of explaining the disorder to those of us who are fortunate enough to have no conception of what it's like to go through this.|`|wxImZRssaa	You do have to be brave. You also have to be crazy. Your mind stops working as it should, and you begin to believe that your suffering is affecting those you love. And for their sakes as well as your own, you must take yourself out of the equation.|`|ev0iOEFwaa	This is a really good question. I have been suicidal in the past. One attempt landed me in ICU. The only reason I am stll alive is because of my family. I know they love me and I do not ever want to hurt them but sometimes the pain I have is so intense that I really just want it to end. Depression can make people feel hopeless and powerless. These feelings can create a situation where an individual believes there is no other way to solve thier problems. I remember searching my head for some way to deal with finacial, spiritual, mental, and emotional problems and finding no answers. I still have no idea how to "fix" myself but I think a good start is reaching out to people and accepting help.    I have found a website that helps explain suicide. It is: http://www.metanoia.org/suicide/. I like how the author explains that suicide can occur when the amount of pain an individual experiances outweighs his or her coping resouces.     Each person is unique and my guess is that there are cases where people might go insane and kill themselves for illogical reasons.  I do agree that is takes courage to kill yourself if you fear death and the physical pain associated with the act. However, it takes more courage to live when faced with such tough challenges. IMPO, no one really knows what happens after death and I see life as a gift. I want to try to make my life as good as it can possibly be because this may be the only chance I got to do it right.

Yes, being healthy is why you keep your weight under control.    12 in 3? Too fast. It will lead to health probs. That is losing 4 Kgs a week - which is close to 10 lbs - wow. Not healthy. That body will put the weight back on and then some when this weight loss regimen is stopped. It is a perfect yo-yo diet scenario.    Never, never adopt this method. No more than 2 or 3 lbs a week (approx. 1 to 1.5 Kgs) and never go below 1200 or 1300 calories per day. This is the mantra.

Losing weight that quick is quite worrying.  If you want to lose then just stick to a healthy balanced diet and exercise.|`|evfsiU4Xaa	Sweetie you need to start eating again.  And believe it or not, if you take regular cardiovascular exercise [running or power walking or swimming] for like half an hour a day.. it wont matter if your eating habits aren't perfect.  However, combining some good healthy food with that exercise will give you the best results.. because I'm afraid once you start eating again [which you will hav to one day] you will pile the weight straight back on.  My advice is to have a healthy breakfast such as special K with banana on top or brown bread toast with a little scrambled egg and some fruit juice.  Then have a healthy lunch like a grilled chicken breast in a veg stir fry with peppers and things.. or even just a tuna mayo and salad sandwich on brown bread.  For evening meal, you can eat whatever your family has, even if its slightly naughty, becuase you will have been really good all day, and providing that you've gotten in your half hour of exercise, you can tolerate a little treat everyday.  If you get hungry during the day, try a handful of nuts and raisins mix with a banana or apple, a handful of grapes and natural yogurt or something.    Anyways bottom line.. dont starve yourself anymore.. it never works and its really bad for you.    Good luck!
G2qcbFopaa	Sorry for the lengthy response but it really is a good one, please read all the way through.     Sounds like your off to a good start. You should hopefully start to lose some weight if you keep at this.     Exercise is really an important part. When you walking make sure you really pushing yourself and getting your heart rate up. You may want to invest in some ankle weight and or wrist weights to push yourself even harder.     A healthy and balanced diet is very important too. Your off to a great start by cutting out most of the fat but it sounds like your diet is a little high in protein.     You should have some carbs in there they just need to be the right kinds of carbs. You should try to avoid all highly refined carbs (things like white bread, white rice, and things with lots of sugar/corn syrup in them e.g. sodas, candies, fruit juices, etc.).     Rather go for carbs that are whole grain and have a lot of fiber in them (Things like whole grain/wheat bread, brown rice, whole/multi-grain pastas, oatmeal w/low sugar and yogurt w/low sugar (check out the mendosa site for a very complete list))     The fiber and low glycemic index cause them to break down slower, therefore keeping you full longer. Their taste may take a little bit of time to get used to, so switch to them slowly, you'll get used to the taste you'll start to like it.     Fruit is great, but also try to find some vegetable you like, and try to eat them steamed, without butter.     Protein shakes are useful for gaining lean muscle which is important but often they are loaded with calories, so if you are going to have shakes make sure your using one that is specified for weight loss and aren't loaded with sugar, maybe slim-fast or something and try to replace a entire meal with it.     Fish is great, tuna are large fish though so they tend to be a little high in mercury so you may not want to be eating them everyday, but that not a huge issue. smaller fish like salmon are a better choice. Salmon are also rich in omega-3 fatty acids which are important.     Special K is good just make sure not to put much/any sugar on it.     Soup is fine too, just make sure its not loaded up with sodium, go for healthy request or reduced sodium soups, also try to avoid soups with a cream base.     Salads would be a good addition too with some sort of vinaigrette dressing just don't put too much on .     High antioxidant content foods such as acai berries, blueberries and goji berries would also help to clean out you body, and I know that you can buy supplements that tend to be cheaper than the juices/dried berries. The brand Natrol make an Acai supplement I like.     For sweetening food try using either splenda or agave nectar. I personally would use agave nectar because its natural and has a low glycemic index rating.     **The biggest thing is not to eat until you are full/stuffed but just until you are satisfied. Reduce you serving sizes at meals. Losing weight will require you to be a little hungry at times.**     Have 3 set meals and between meals if you need to snack, eat things like nuts like almonds(raw if you can find them) or vegetables like carrots and celery. Make sure you eat breakfast to jump start your metabolism.  Also, try not to eat late in the day. Try to stop eating after 6 or 7.    Try taking a daily multivitamin too, preferably not centrum or one-a-day, but maybe something from your local health food store/whole foods. They tend to be a little more expensive, but are well worth it.     To sum up what to eat  -Good Carbs (High fiber, Low Glycemic Index)  -Fruits  -Vegetables  -Smaller Fish  -Special K (skim milk)  -Lower Sodium soups (not cream based)  -Salads  -Antioxidants (Acai)  -Raw Almonds, Carrots Celery   -Multivitamin    Hope this helps. Best of luck!|`|vGxipYJnaa	Many protein shakes are actually full of calories and much protein - check the label.    It's great that you're eating healthily - I think you'll start to see results quite soon.     The only other thing I can think of is that you have a medical condition which is preventing you from losing the weight. It might be worth it to see a doctor.|`|f3vbrZdfaa	Excess of your calorie intake restore as a fat, so you become overweight. Therefor when you receive less calorie than your body required your body start to burn fat and you lose weight. The important point is if you don't lose weight that is you change your diet, however your calorie intake is high. For example banana has higher calorie than cucumber. So there is a big difference you eat banana as a fruit or cucumber. I think it is better for you calculate your calorie requirements and get some information about calorie content of each food.

P1H02dqgaa	Hey Lilly!    I know! I have the same problem too - and I've got really dark hair with pale skin!!  I'm envious of those girls that have really smooth, clean arm pits - because it never seems to work for me.    I know someone's mentioned waxing - but I ended up in a worse mess, because the skin heals over - and then I get 'loads' of ingrowing hairs!    The best way I've found is to put a warm flannel under each armpit whilst I'm in the bath (just to open the pores and soften the stubble a bit).    After a few minutes, use an exfoliant or loofah mitt to remove any dead skin and raise the hair stubble.  Then, with a good moisturising shower gel or shaving lotion (not heavily fragranced - I use Johnson's PH5.5) use a sharp razor for shaving.  A blunt one will end up scrapping the skin too much.    Always moisturise afterwards.  Each shower or bath you take, exfoliate the armpits again (even when not shaving), so that it inhibits skin growth over the top of the hair follicle which leads to those little red spots.  And of course, moisturise again.  Some deodorants are quite harsh too.  Many years ago, I changed to Mum roll-on.  It must be gentle because it's the only one you can use straight after shaving which doesn't sting!    I was told that some people do have terrible problems with this type of thing.  If it is very bad, you could see your GP.  There is a prescription product available now that inhibits hair growth - it's called Vaniqa - but I don't think all GPs really know about it yet  And I guess, unless you're suffering dreadfully (with abscesses etc), most doctors would be reluctuant to prescribe it any way.  But if my suggestion hasn't helped, it's worth going to discuss it with the doctor.    Hope I've managed to help.    Best of luck hon.  Karen|`|b773fcf2d62b3ff1e4c6b8c9a8c4f60eaa	I'm sure this is going to be advice that a lot of people will give you but try going ot the doctors I'm sure there some kind of cream for it.

After you get out of the shower, dry your armpits and apply it atleast 5 mins before putting deoderant on.  If you're not constantly exposing your armpits (e.g. wearing vest tops, swimming, etc), you could switch to waxing. This has the downsides that you have to let the hair grow, it's more expensive than shaving, and does hurt a little, but it will stop the constant stubble.  Hope I helped x|`|bDiPIj3eaa	dno is there sum cream or summin dno soz|`|D54u7mZ8aa	make shore that you always use shaving cream and you might have to keep shaving the stubble i guess     also shaving in the morning and night will help (with shaving cream)    also you can get creams for all the problems you have at a pharmacy just go in and ask its ok|`|cUgtkGdVaa	Nair|`|k3EGPOXGaa	Go on Google and type in "ingrow go" and click on any website that sells it - it is the BEST thing I have ever used for ingrown hairs.

TCpTlCTRaa	I don't know about "snake oil". but I do know that essential oils are very effective for stimulating new hair growth and keeping hair healthy. Essential oil scalp massage can help all types of female hair loss, as long as the follicle is still alive and undamaged, With hereditary hair loss, the follicle begins to shrink slowly and gradually. It takes many years for the follicle to stop producing hair. Essential oils help keep the follicle alive and energized, supplying nourishment through increased local blood circulation. They have a vasodilating effect that helps keep the follicle from shrinking. They also have the ability to dissolve excess sebum and cleanse the scalp of any pollutants. This cleansing action helps minimize the effects of dht. A healthy anti-inflammatory diet, nutritional supplementation and regular exercise can also help inhibit hereditary hair loss in those who are predisposed. See source below for more information.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	that is a scam the snake oil|`|OyBuEpOTaa	This depends on your age and the cause. There are quite a few causes.

Rk46lIBwaa	Xenical (orlistat) does not really have any significant drug interactions.    However a couple of words of warning, first though chemically Xenical does produce weight loss, it does so by causing reduction of fat absorption. This causes wind, liquid diarrhoea, 'accidents', abdominal cramp and foul smelling liquid stool. These side effects can be reduced by eating a very low fat diet.      In supervised studies patients lost and sustained the loss of quite a lot of weight, unfortunately these experiences are often not repeated in the community.    Statistically diet + exercise is more successful for those that stick to it. Another advantage is that vigorous exercise also reduces blood pressure.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	It depends entirely on the BP medication you are taking, what is the name of the drug?

According to the book From the Heart, over 50% of people don't use their medications properly. They combine drugs that shouldn't be combined, don't follow the instructions for when or how to take them (morning or night, with food or fluids, etc.), they fail to take their medications regularly, or they take too much.     Ten percent of hospital admissions are due to medication misuse.    Self medicating with over-the-counter or herbal remedies in combination with your prescribed meds can be dangerous. The interaction between medications can increase, decrease, or change the effects of a drug.     To be safe, check with your doctor or pharmacist.

AA12266052	Herpes zoster (Shingles) is more likely to occur in people whose immune system is impaired due to aging, immunosuppressive therapy, psychological stress, or other factors.  Herpes zoster usually clears in 2 to 3 weeks and rarely recurs. If the virus affects the nerves that control movement (the motor nerves), you may have temporary or permanent weakness or paralysis.  Sometimes, the pain in the area where the shingles occurred may last from months to years. This pain, called post-herpetic neuralgia, can be extremely severe. The elderly are at higher risk for this complication  The symptoms of herpes zoster cannot be transmitted to another person.  Involvement of the facial nerve may cause Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which can lead to loss of movement in the face, hearing loss, loss of taste, and other symptoms.  Other complications may include:      * Another attack of shingles      * Blindness (if lesions occur in the eye)      * Deafness      * Infection, lesions in body organs, encephalitis or sepsis in persons with weakened immune systems      * Post-herpetic neuralgia      * Secondary bacterial skin infections|`|9fec6a8704a864b61d3862874ce94967aa	I suffered on and off from shingles for about 20 years. Stress brought the attacks on, although they gradually diminished over time.    I had had chicken pox as a child, but got my first shingles attack in my 20's!|`|CdvZF1Z6aa	She should see a doctor about the shingles. Treatment includes an anti-viral medication which is more effective the closer it is taken to the onset of the shingles.    Doctors also may prescribe a steroidal anti-inflamatory such as prednisone, which helps with the pain and itching.    Often an over the counter  NSAID (non steroidal anti-inflamatory drug) medication like ibuprofen (Advil) or naproxen (Aleve) will be effective in helping the pain. In severe cases, the doctor may prescribe a more powerful pain medicine.    Again, I would suggest an immediate visit to a doctor. Shingles can last as little as 3 weeks, but may continue for months or longer. There is also a chance of postherpetic neuralgia, which you could read more about at wikipedia.com.    Shingles can occur at any age to a person who has had chicken pox;  though it is more common in older people. Approximately one million Americans develop shingles each year. There is now a vaccine available to prevent shingles. It is typically given to people age 60 and over.|`|pXPdO2I8aa	You cannot "catch" shingles from your Nan.|`|MojYmo5Jaa	I've had shingles twice and it is very painful.

U8gIdoXFaa	His allergies make it all pretty tough huh. He doesnt sound too good at the moment  but neither do you. I know this word gets thrown around a lot but 'stress' isnt helping either of you at the moment. Some will consider this bad advice but in your case I think this could help. You're not in a position  to focus on any sort of meditation  or real  relaxation, so  I wonder if your doctor would give the both of you a very low dose of valium, or something like that.    These things are addictive so low doses only and only when you're desperate.  It would help you sleep too and Im sure you and hubby could both use a bit more than you're getting.     You both need to stay as calm as you can at the moment. You both need to rest.

I am always on the warm side, so extra heat is my enemy.      I believe your thoughts are correct. Less healthy seems to have a harder time with the cold.

qq5nceCXaa	When you feel motivated.    There's no point in picking a time because someone else says it's better if it doesn't suit you.  The best time for the most benefit is when it fits into your lifestyle so you'll get the exercise habit for life.    If however you have free choice then first thing in the morning is good as you get it done and have fewer things competing for the time, thing si that you are more likely to get injuries if you don't warm up properly.  From a body clock viewpoint late afternoon, but that tends to be when people have the most competition for demands on time.    For morning exercise  Pros:   ? The majority of people who exercise consistently do so early in the day. It is easier to form the exercise habit through morning exercise.   ? Fewer distractions and schedule interruptions.   ? Can make time for exercise by getting up a bit earlier.   ? Raises your heart rate and metabolism to burn more calories earlier in the day.   ? Gives a feeling of physical energy for hours.   ? Improves your mental acuity for hours.   ? Cooler temperatures in summer.   ? Air pollution is lowest in the morning.   ? The body adjusts to your exercise time, so if you are training for a morning sports event, train in the morning.   Cons:   ? Body temperature is at its lowest 1-3 hours before awakening, making morning a time of naturally lower energy and blood flow.   ? Cold, stiff muscles may be more prone to injury - be sure to warm up well before doing a higher intensity workout, and do gentle stretching.   ? If you do not enjoy morning exercise, you won't easily form a habit by choosing a morning workout time.   ? Because body temperature and hormones are higher in late afternoon, you probably get the same or better calorie-burning effects later in the day.   For Lunchtime  Pros:   ? Can make a habit to exercise at lunch and break time.   ? Can use an exercise partner at work, school, or in your neighborhood.   ? Body temperature and hormone levels are higher than first thing in the morning.   ? Can help regulate the amount of food you feel like eating for lunch, and help you avoid break-time snacking.   ? Improves blood flow to the brain so you are sharper in the afternoon.   ? Stress relief from work, school, or home stresses.   Cons:   ? Time constraints may not allow you to get in a full workout. Any amount is good, but best if you can do 30 to 60 minutes or more at a stretch   ? Distractions and other commitments make keep you from exercising at the appointed times.   ? Research shows that lung function is worst at noon. For a vigorous workout or for those with lung problems, the 15% to 20% difference may be felt.   For mid afternoon  Pros:   ? For most people, body temperature and hormone levels peak at 6 p.m. Exercising 3 hours before or after the peak will give your your best workout for both endurance and building muscle.   ? Research shows lung function is best at 4 p.m. to 5 p.m.   ? Muscles are warm and flexible.   ? Perceived exertion is lowest -- how hard you feel yourself to be working at exercise. So you may be able to work out harder or faster by doing so in the afternoon.   ? Can help regulate the amount of food you feel like eating for dinner.   ? Stress relief after a day at work, school, or home.   Cons:   ? Distractions and other commitments make keep you from exercising at the appointed times.   For evenings  Pros:   ? For most people, body temperature and hormone levels peak at 6 p.m. Exercising 3 hours before or after the peak will give your your best workout for both endurance and building muscle.   ? Muscles are warm and flexible.   ? Perceived exertion is low -- how hard you feel yourself to be working at exercise. So you may be able to work out harder or faster.   ? Can help regulate the amount of food you feel like eating for dinner.   ? Stress relief after a day at work, school, or home.   Cons:   ? Distractions and other commitments make keep you from  exercising at the appointed times.   ? Need to allow one to three hours to wind down after exercise to be able to fall asleep.   ? If you discover sleeping problems, need to schedule your workout earlier.   ? At dark times of the year, be sure to wear reflective gear.     The Very Best Time     The very best time to Exercise? It can only do you good if you actually do it!|`|9ddb6f609e51d847460515fa2e1cae3daa	working out in the morning is the most effective since you're boosting up your metabolism fro the whole day, plus your body burns all that fat since it doesn't have much of another source of energy (carbs)|`|UzvoQvB2aa	I hear everything physical works best right befor you go to bed such as lotion and eye cream perhaps this applies to exercise as well|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	well yes and no.. your testerone is the highest in the morining.. assuming u are a dude..... so that would maximize    but other then that.. not really.... as long as u find a time of day to trian.. u are alright..|`|evfsiU4Xaa	One article I read said that 4pm after school or work was a good time as it gets you moving again after you've been sitting all day and is ideal for burning off any naughty things you may have eaten earlier that day.    I wasn't sure if I agreed. I see the logic, but I tend to vary my time of workout, because it suits my lifestyle better. For example Mon-Fri I have my workout in the evening after work, but on saturdays and sundays I hav it in the morning, before I go out etc as it gives me a chance to shower and things before I go out.    I think whatever works for you is fine for you, but you shouldn't move your lifestyle to fit your workout. As long as you are working out regularly and combining it with a sensible diet.. you are going to see results =]

k3EGPOXGaa	I suffered with shin splints so badly that I ended up with a stress fracture.  I was told that I had shin splints by a doctor but because I wanted to play football so badly I kept on playing and it got worse and worse to the point where I could barely walk.    Rest is essential.  If you want to keep exercising for now do some swimming it will help burn the calories but without the pounding on hard ground which has caused this.    I had to have physio and was made to put my legs up to me knees in ice cold water (use a large bucket, fill with water and add ice cubes).  I had to sit in it for around 10 - 15 mins.  It is cold as hell but brilliant in the healing process.  I just sat and watched tv while I did it!  It helps so much though believe me.    Keep resting until the pain subsides a lot and then take it easy on teh treadmill with mostly walking.  Once your body gets used to it you will be able to keep running.      My shin splints was caused mainly due to the fact that I have very tight calf muscles so stretching is absolutely essential.    If you continue with this problem then go to a sports physio.  I went to one for about 30 a session but it was worth every penny, I had about 4.  I had to have deep massage which was excruciating but helped massively.    Hopefully you wont have to go that far.  Just get swimming and putting your legs into some ice buckets and rest!!   Good luck.|`|SGlb0EP8aa	No. 1 thing to check is your footwear, make sure you are wearing supportive running shoes / trainers / sneakers otherwise when you foot hits the treadmill the 'shock' will be absorbed by your body rather than your footwear.|`|E3yOmel9aa	Please read the link, it should help you.

The only way to prevent this from happening is for your body to get used to the exercise. Running on hard surfaces make you more prone to shin splints, you could try running on an elliptical or maybe in a grassy area if you don't have access to a gym.     Once you have been running awhile, you shouldn't get shin splints anymore. Also, make sure you let them heal all the way before you start running again or you are just going to aggravate them more.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Hi there  I expereinced this problem too and sometimes still do! I asked a personal trainer in my gym and she told me to strap my calf around so it is level with my shin and tape it.  I works believe me, the pain sometimes goes up into my back too.  Footballers are prone to it too, it gets worse if u run outside, so I try to stick to soft ground or turf so the shock does not bother my shins or back.  Hope this helps.
e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	There is nothing "normal" about sexual abuse, and it can manifest it's self in many way in later years.  If the person never got to confront the abuser, then it's never really settled.  My abuser died (step father) 8 years after I got away. But I am left with deep feelings of Not being worthy of other peoples love, I want to trust people, but it is difficult, because I need so much reassurance, it pushes people away, (except for my Great, Super Husband who has stuck with me through the thousands of ups and downs the last 23 years.  I try so hard to be a people pleaser, that when they don't respond in like kind, or with a shard of thanks, I feel that they don't like me, even family members.  I am full of anxiety when things aren't going smoothly.  Even though I am married, and with my husband, it was 15 years before I could sleep with the bedroom door closed, (because that's where my abuser use to come to abuse me (other places too, but when that bedroom door would open (no locks allowed) it scared me to death so I use to leave my door open so I could hear him coming, and also in case my mom would Happen to wake up, and I would pray she would.    I am full of anger, but I bury it, untill something comes up that makes me mad, and then I erupt, or cry for days.    So, that's just what I go through - after 49 years (i was 7 - 14) during the continued abuse.  He stalked me after the divorce from my mom, and caught me once, - the reason i never said anything is because he ALWAYS told me he would kill my family, ALWAYS , and he had held guns on us many times, so i knew he would.  Then at 16 when he caught me, he promised to kill my BF, then he took me in the woods, and I won't be graphic here, but you get it.      So there is  NO  Normal in sexual abused people.    I hope this helps, but it is different for people.|`|3ZgmcNK9aa	Years later, there are a whole mess of problems that may arise.

yLRT2NX5aa	Not much, but you MUST do cardio if you want to lose the fat...and you need to also be toning your ab muscles. Research different ab exercises and also do 20 - 30 minutes of cardio at least every other day. Your weight might not change much because muscle is denser than fat...so the fat that you lose will be replaced with muscle, so don't get upset if you don't lose anything. Also my husband told me it's important to have more reps (compared to more weight if doing it on a machine) with ab exercises. Hope that helps a bit...Good luck!|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Ab workouts are considered core exercises,  You cannot get bigger doing them, you will at best increase you back strength, and posture.  this will keep you from injuring you lower back later in life.

People do thousand a week sometimes when they get obsessive  Good Luck God Bless|`|8rMgQv15aa	At 133 lbs. you are well on your way to getting that six pack. You can start to do ab exercises while you do your cardio. don't worry about your stomach getting bigger at this point. I would pick about 5 to 7 good ab workouts and switch them up every day. To start out you should do a good 45 min. of cardio workouts. If you are a little out of shape a good way to get started is to do a fast paced walk for about 5 mins. and for about 15 seconds go to a full out sprint and then back to a walk for another 5 min. keep doing that for the next 45 min. and then get into your ab workouts.     Ab workouts burn calories just as any exercise would, but it is also strengthening just those muscles while you are burning calories. So, the best way to burn a lot more calories without working your abs to get rid of the "fatty abs" you mentioned above is to do about 45 min. of cardio before each ab workout. 3 times a week starting out is good, but if you want to see fast results I would shoot for 4 to 5 times a week.     Cardio exercises can be anything that gets your heart rate pumping. You could jog, bike, use an eliptical machine etc. Just remember that it takes work just as anything else in life, so stick with it! Hopefully I'll see you on the beach sometime this summer and we can show off our 6 packs together! haha.    I found s website while I was researching the best way to get a 6 pack myself.

While you supplied your height and weight you could have (naturally) very large hips, large breasts or anything else that may take responsibility for the weight. However, your abs will show more if you eat food with a lesser fat content. It is highly unlikely you will have abs on top of fat - in fact, I'm sure that's impossible. So, if you exercise, the body fat on top of your abs will cut down regardless.

That's when you alternate aerobic activity (so you start burning energy) and strength building exercises. I've always found my public library to be the easiest way to find new workouts and there are several instant watches on Netflix as well.  The following DVDs are particularly good for toning in a hurry and all of them were available at my library.     10 minute solutions kick-box boot camp  Prevention 321 Workout  Prevention Shortcuts to Weight loss Sculpting  Prevention Belly Butt Thighs  Emergency Workout Cardio & Toning  Slim Sleek Fast  Crunch Boot Camp Training  Crunch Cardio Sculpt    For more ideas I'd check out both Prevention http://www.prevention.com/cda/homepage.d...  And Shape magazine websites http://www.shape.com/indexpage/  For solid workout ideas    It's always great to work out and tone up, but also remember that you are on the low side of normal so you may not have much weight loss. Also since you are that size it may not be fat but just skin and muscle,  Bones aren't supposed to show through your skin, and as you tone up you will have more muscle showing, and less bone.      Either way you have plenty of time and if you do start a regular workout routine at least 40 mins a day 5-6 days a week. You will look and feel great by April.

Is there a health food store near you?  Someone who is knowledgeable in herbs would be a safe way to start.  Although many 'brands' of herbs have 'formulas' specific to certain ailments/problems...such as, a 'cold formula, or 'memory formula'  etc.  I'm an herbalist and produce my own formulas etc...and know that they work.  I've been using my own fomula for PMS etc..for about 10 yrs...works great, keeps all symptoms away (except the food cravings, drat!) :o).  So do a little homework and ask questions.  Herbs to look for are:  Wild Yam, Black Cohosh, Dong Quai/Angelica, Damiana, Chaste Tree...there are more of course but at least they will get you on the right track.  If you need help with dosage ask someone or follow the label.  Also depending on your periods would also depend on how often you use the formula...most use it 14 days after their period and then take the herbs till you get your period then stop...and count again etc.    Again any questions just ask..and don't hesitate to get more medical guidance as well.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	it could be your boobs are growing but it would be smart to go get your hormones checked just to be safe|`|DlNPo5CLaa	you are a boy and you have abreast fed do you know abot breast feed vor menstruation go ask you family members|`|zXR1qcK4aa	lady dont ware the bra night times and to maintain lose bra at somw extent okay....9440583966
BdlGBdE5aa	First, you need to understand that the major cause of bad breath is the bacteria that is on the top of your tongue.  Stick out your tongue and look for some "white stuff".  This is the bacteria and must be cleaned off if you are going to get rid of bad breath.  Mints and gums just cover up the bad breath for a very short time.  I found a very good tongue cleaner called OraBrush which has both a brush and a scraper and along with some mouthwash will easily clean your tongue.  It also gives you a very clean mouth feeling because you have cleaned your tongue.|`|lqQbVk2Daa	Get some breath mints! Geez...|`|f6OOxJQsaa	brush your tongue too|`|TVz2UoOyaa	always brush your teeth and use mouthwash..  or better go to the dentist..|`|MfcTIdlraa	Here are a few hints:  Gargle with mouthwash  Brush your teeth  Breath mint  If you have bad teeth, see a dentist for fillings  carry breath spray around and USE IT!!|`|DzHB8z6Yaa	1: Make careful dietary choices to keep bad breath at bay. Choose milder versions of your favorite selection that aren't too spicy. Avoid dishes that contain garlic or onions. Order sandwiches without the processed meats.     Step2: Use sugar-free gum or mints to increase the flow of saliva to avoid a dry mouth, which can cause bad breath. Drink plenty of water to rinse the mouth frequently and to stay well hydrated. Monitor consumption of caffeine, which can dry the mouth.     Step3: Keep a toothbrush, a small tube of toothpaste, floss and a small bottle of mouthwash in a desk drawer or briefcase. Carry a breath spray to refresh after a meal.     Step4: Brush teeth in the morning and evening and after meals when possible. Use a battery-powered toothbrush to thoroughly brush teeth and clean the tongue, a source of many breath odors.     Step5: Visit a dentist regularly to maintain a healthy mouth.

Do lunges, work calves, hamstrings, inner thighs. It's going to take you bout 6 months to see a definate difference. If you want to lose the belly fat, you need to cut down on calories (not too much ) and increase working out. Hit the crunches at the gym.. maybe 3 sets of 50, to 4 sets of 50 crunches... just stay active, give a little time to working out each day... but when you get in the gym, take advantage of every minute... keep your routine, just lower calorie intake a little, drink plenty of H2O..|`|c97b11f063d5417bc2c001b07d58e097aa	Lots of cardio 45 mins a day 4-5x's a week.

E3yOmel9aa	If you are exercising and only eating 1,000 calories your body will store everything instead of burn. If you were in a coma you would still need at least 1200 calories to keep your organs working properly.|`|TKNPveHDaa	First, you weigh yourself too much.  The body fluctuates 1-4 pounds every day.  Second, to lose a pound you need to drop 3500 calories.    If you ate 1000 calories, and your body generally burns 2000 calories a day, and you added 120 minutes, probably about 600 calories, you're still 1000 calories short of a pound.    lastly, at 120, no matter what your height, you don't need to lose more weight.  You're borderline starving yourself and you're not making healthy decisions.|`|0co7ZDUlaa	probably cuz your body is getting used to the exercise you need to up it. and you will gain muscle before the weight comes right off! good luck|`|DIILQSPXaa	You haven't given it enough time.

Hope I helped you xo|`|aNwWauXzaa	Weight can fluctuate +/- 5 lbs. throughout the day, so you couldn't really tell if one or two pounds was gone.  Also, a pound of fat is about ~3500 calories, which is going to take a few days, at least.  You should check an online calorie counter and see how many calories you need per day to stay exactly where you are, then drop that number by 500-1000.|`|XBH61aAIaa	How tall are you? If you're already underweight your body may not lose anymore for a looot of reasons (enough for me to write a book). However, if you're not underweight or at a healthy weight your body may just be adjusting. You may also be losing weight but the scale will not show it. A lot of dieting books suggest you only weigh yourself once a week because your weight fluctuates.|`|9f3e662ced5c3455403ad740118b4e2baa	Because 2 days is not enough time to make real progress.

vIivJkO5aa	Don't worry too much about it,  my boyfriends 5'5, way shorter than you.  And I'm 5'7.  Your personality can make up for what you lack in height.  And I'm not shallow enough to judge on height anyway.    Don't smoke or drink alot of caffeine&alcohol.  They are known to stunt your growth.  You havent stopped growing yet either, so dont worry :)|`|yfytMbnSaa	You need to roll around in some radioactive waste.|`|vGxipYJnaa	You're 16 - relax! You could still grow a few inches.

You can't make yourself grow - it's determined by genes. Just don't smoke or drink and you should reach your determined height.

You need to confront your addiction head on and when you quit you need to forget about it and never pretend to do it or think about it. Think of it as little as possible. If people ask dont say you are a reformed smoker say you dont smoke. dont keep bringing it into your mind you have to remove it from your mind and life. I gave up this way. I heard of a man who used to keep a cigarette in his top pocket and every day he would pull it out, look at it and say ' Who is stronger, me or you?' then he would put it back and go on with his life. Now I wouldnt do that. I am not that strong. I gave up 5 years ago and although it doesnt bother me now I know I am only one puff away from the 2 pack a day habit I had for 30 + years. So dont do what you just did no matter that it made you feel better. Life will get better without the smokes I promise you. But it is so little space from what you just did to lighting it up. Dont waste all the effort you have put into giving up. I know you want to start again but dont. It will get better I promise. One hour at a time...one day at a time. And soon you will spend most of your time not thinking about it honest you will. I wont lie...now and then you will want one but so what. I want a million dollars too but I doubt I will get it. Be stronger than that cigarette. If I can do it so can you. Just try to forget they exist.|`|1xHTeIqaaa	First of all, just have to say good on you for going cold turkey! Im sure its difficult but itll be worth it..  Just think how much money you'll save!  And if it helps you to relax when you pretend then its not weird at all. You should do whatever helps you to quit! If thats your way of dealing with it then you keep it up.  Best of luck! :)|`|GutYNu9baa	Keep at, it if anything helps you to stop, then do it (Within reason!)|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	go for a walk read a book call a friend and see if that helps|`|olMVfnljaa	Lol!

Sadly it didn't work for me :(.  I just ended up lighting the darn thing.        Hahaha!  Well, ya know, sometimes I'm not the brightest bulb...but I did do that when I was in my teens, taking someone's suggestion.    Another trick I learned was drinking a full glass of water whenever you get a craving.  Now that actually DOES work.  I lasted nearly 2 weeks without a cig then.  Unfortunately I was such a meanie the security department at the hospital I worked for chipped in and bought me a carton of cigarettes, told me never quit smoking again. :|  Perhaps you can try the glass of water trick, too, if it gets too much on you.|`|UzvoQvB2aa	that makes sense, I quit smoking weed and sometimes I just sit their with a pipe and lighter in my hand like if I'm having a session and it helps me|`|GBXvJ5mjaa	If it helps it helps!

jIk2ttH1aa	NO.  Not in the way that this article represents.  I think that the parents should be given in home care as overeating to extreme is a mental disease.  If the child is put into a program or needs outside help it should not be done through social services but through a medical care facility.  Do anorexics get taken away from their parents?  One could make the same case that the parents are neglectful for not FORCING the child to eat.  It is a struggle for parents with children with these problems.  They need to medical intervention not punishment or shame.  That is not a motivator for anything but self loathing which leads to extreme eating disorders.  ANd round and round it goes.  So NO I do not think they should be "taken away".      Thanks for the article/question.    Best wishes.|`|2IBHMk9Naa	I think parents should first be warned,  And if they don't change their lifestyle then the child deserves better parents, more responsible ones!

It's always important to drink a LOT of liquids when you're sick, and a lot of people don't so they end up getting dehydrated, but by eating soup, it helps to rehydrate them, thus making them better.

I know some people use them for detoxing and some use them just for the foot spa aspect of it, so it's up to each person as far as why they use it or if they would like just a foot bath if they just want the spa part of it.  Good luck!|`|tkDfqjQdaa	I've done it one time and would like to do it again.  My experience was good and I did notice a difference.  Aside from the fact that my feet were really really clean I noticed a relaxed state, an altered perception (in the same way energy work and body work can create) and improved energy for the rest of the day.  I'm still not sure how much I believe in a whole body detox but I did feel some mild detox symptoms over the next 24 hours so it did something in that regard.  Try it before you buy one  to see what you think about it.
AA11481525	Part of the contact lens rx IS the brand, so the answer is it has to be filled  with that brand.

It needs to be investigated and treated.    The source can be steroids you take, steroids from a tumor (pituitary, adrenal, or anywhere) or rarely, depression in the extreme or acoholism to the extreme.     You need to see an endocrinologist for testing and treatment. However, not all endocrinologist know this syndrome as some consider it rare and have never treated it (they see it, they just do not know how to treat it).    Do research, get copies of all your tests, and make you get to an excellent doctor. You need a lot of tests and an MRI, adrenal scan, etc. There is no one test that can tell you that you have it, or tell you that you do not have it. Remember that as doctors that are not experienced will try to rule you out on one test.    I had it as well as other conditions. Cushing's potentially can do a lot of damage so please seek care as soon as you can.
y6jPCsi2aa	The Anshar Diet    As an American I've seen enough crazy fad diets in my day to fill several weeks full of infomercials and advertisements. As such I'm going to give you the benefit of many years of health and nutrition classes and do my good deed for the year.    I'm going to tell you how to not only lose weight but change the composition of your body, increase your health, and best of all.. keep it off.    First, let's dispel some common myths.    Myth 1:  Eating less calories will make me lose weight.  Unfortunately this isn't always true. A lot of different factors program your metabolism but one of the key things is how OFTEN you eat. If you fast all day long and then have a 500 calorie meal at the end of the day almost ALL of it will be stored by your body.    Myth 2:  I can have a diet with no carbs and be healthy.  This really is a testament to how much Americans want a quick fix. Diets like the Atkin's Diet cause your body to start devouring itself, increase your cholesterol, and in certain cases can even kill you. One thing I WON'T argue, death will indeed cause you to lose weight, permanently.    Myth 3:  If I go on a diet I will lose weight.  99% of people who go on diets will end up putting on MORE weight than they lost from a diet. This is because diet is supposed to be a LIFESTYLE change, not something you do for 2 weeks. If you starve your body it will make fat cells and increase their size even faster.    Myth 4:  I need to go out and exercise to lose weight.  This isn't actually true but it's important to say that having daily activities WILL keep you healthy. If you burn almost no calories every day what else do you think your body is going to do with them? Balancing a healthy lifestyle with a good diet is what you want here, not killing yourself by running every afternoon.    Myth 5:  The scale in my bathroom gives me a good idea of how healthy I am.  The dreaded bathroom scale does NOT tell you how healthy you are. Let's say I have 10 lbs of fat, don't drink water, and have little muscle mass. Then I work out for 3 months and hydrate every day. I lose 5 lbs of fat but gain 7 lbs of muscle and 3 pounds of average water weight. What will happen when I look at the scale? Are you being fair to yourselves? Judge yourself by how you feel, not what a spinning number under your feet tells you.        With these common myths out of the way I'll tell you the secret. It's five simple steps.    ~~The Anshar Diet~~  1. Only eat until you are no longer hungry.  This does NOT mean that you starve yourself. It means after you take a few bites of food ask yourself if you're still hungry. If you're not, into the fridge it goes. While we're at it, CHEW YOUR FOOD. at least 10 times per bite (using common sense if you're eating applesauce, this isn't an excuse to be an idiot).    2. Eat at least 6 (more if your schedule allows) meals a day.  I know this seems counterintuitive, but hear me out. If you eat 6-8 meals a day the meals are very small (often around 100-200 calorie "snacks"), provided you are only eating until you are NOT HUNGRY. When your body is not hungry your metabolism will not try to store energy as fat. It really is that simple. Smaller meals aid in digestion, they increase the nutrition you get from your food, and they keep you from being lethargic. If you eat when you're hungry your body stores MORE of it as fat ("Hmm. I'm hungry, I don't know where my next meal will come from! I'd better hold onto this.")    3. Eat BEFORE you get hungry.  Schedule your 6-10 meals throughout the day and stick to them. If you're waiting until you get hungry to eat you've already screwed this up. Your body stores energy if you're hungry, if your body sees food and just takes what it needs then you're running at optimum efficiency. This is called programming your metabolism.    4. Eat breakfast. Always.  Your first meal of the day is also the meal you have no choice over being hungry for. Your body has been replenishing itself all night and needs fuel. Since now you KNOW that hunger means you store your food then that means you want to keep breakfast LIGHT. A cup of cereal and a banana. A granola bar and an apple. LIGHT does NOT mean you skip breakfast. If you skip breakfast you are telling your metabolism to turn ALL of the next meal you eat into stored fat.    5. Drink water.  (I'm a big hypocrite on this one, but I can't stress it enough) Most people think that if they pick up a glass of orange juice instead of a soda they're doing themselves a favor, and that's not entirely true. A glass of orange juice can have just as many calories as some sodas. Try looking at the label sometime. If you're thirsty, drink water. If you love your soda then have your soda (real soda, not diet, artificial sweetners have been argued to be one of the worst things to ever happen to western civilization). If you decide to have a drink to treat yourself, pour yourself a half glass, don't take a can or bottle with you and for go|`|E3yOmel9aa	Please do not try fads like pills and diets that promote starvation.

Chances of your hard drive surviving the elements, trash guys and the dump are extremely slim.
CWlKnQPuaa	nah, having the foreskin easier, the piss comes out at a lower velocity due to the friction with the skin, i have to stand out the doorway if i pull it back and want it to actually go in the bowl.|`|AA10096628	you KNOW it helps? are you intact? it really makes no difference... and if you do have to pull it back at bit, it's no biggie... it's asking do you have to unzip your pants to pee?|`|MQE7iVHcaa	Yes, and it doesn't make it more difficult.  For me it makes no difference.  I can leave it forward and still be able to make the bowl.|`|LXbzih6qaa	Yes, I have done it, and a few times I have missed a bit. What makes you miss is how much or how little you pull it back. If you don't pull it back far enough it may interfere with the urethra. If you pull it too far back the connective tissue will change the direction/aim of the urethra.|`|2dke6ChJaa	BAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHA    geez, you guys have it rugh, lmfao|`|PAvYZJK2aa	some do and some don't|`|AA11522944	Bud...  you should be pulling your foreskin back to pee if it is retractable.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Some guys pull it back and find it harder to aim if they don't. Other guys leave it forward and find it harder to aim if they don't. There have been lots of questions on this.    Harriet|`|PpKJIT0aaa	You make it sound like having a banana instead of a penis.|`|4arnbpUCaa	Personally, I usually don't.|`|yfytMbnSaa	No, the foreskin doesn't interfere with urination at all. I'd say that it would actually help it.|`|AA11445608	well if u do it while u are peeing and not before.. i suppose it might slighly change the direction and u may miss... has happend to me once or twice.. havent missed the bowl because of it though|`|z7cItuZTaa	whats it matter. guys with it circumsized miss the bowl sometimez too anyway, you got to know what your aiming at.
9pLdhuBnaa	This could be related to the Dianette as far as your body still trying to adjust to the medication (an example only).    I would recommend seeing your doctor for further evaluation of the situation to see what they say.
9923f578763ad24193648aeb065ca022aa	It does sound like a sty. Get into your local optometrist, most take vision and medical insurances, it should just be a copay to be seen and most do same day. You will most likely be written a prescription or eyedrop that will help with pain, etc.|`|o9muJ73yaa	First thig is do you wear makeup?  Maybe you rubbed your eyes too hard when removing your makeup that could be a possibility, try using a warm compress to reduce the swelling and if it continues to hurt see an optometrist.|`|AA11085095	maybe a sty or you could have a cold in your eye|`|Vaz8cWkSaa	I agree with the 1st answerer, it sounds like a sty. Go to your optometrist and have it checked out, and they will most likely write you a perscription for some eye drops.    Hope this helps!  ~dcallstar51|`|SjUTP14Xaa	it is a sty
fQ7UBgOsaa	I am sorry if this sounds silly, but the answer to your question: IT IS COLD OUTSIDE!!!! YOU'VE GOT TO WEAR THICK SOCKS AND WINTER BOOTS!!!! It is as simple as that. THAT's what's "wrong."|`|18a5d7e369330da3a47ede67c6e1e096aa	You might have received a slight frost bite and your body is still repairing. That is most likely why they are still numb.
z3pTQ8N6aa	go to the docter it might be just very watery mucus i get that in the wintertime|`|hBmafVYoaa	Wipe it?
evfsiU4Xaa	There is a chance that you are not doing them correctly.    Firstly, you need to be lying on a soft surface like a folded towel or a soft rug or something if you dont have an abs mat.    And secondly, you need to make sure your technique is right.    Lie flat on your back with your knees bent and up. Take your hands behind your eyes on either side of you head and [only using your abdominals!] bring you body up towards your thighs and back down again. Exhale on the way up and inhale on the way down. Nice and easy at a steady speed.    This should solve the problem with your back, but your abs will start to hurt after a while. This is because the muscles are being worked, and its normal, but dont push yourself beyond this pain.. its your body's way of telling you to stop.    If your back still hurts, maybe ab crunches aren't for you, and there are other ways of exercising your tummy. Just do a google search on them for some great examples =]    Good luck.|`|urGXKo7Raa	one way because ur back hurts is because you may have done them right but you need to wait like a week until your back does not ache no more. It might be because it is ur first time doing them and also because u are not accustomed to them. the same thing happened to me during my first push ups my back and my chest felt like xploding because i have never ever done more than 10. so at first it hurts then when you get used to it then it won't hurt no more|`|BkatcMZbaa	The first time doing it right...no problem  The 2nd time you did it carelessly and had internal injury  The 3rd time you feel the pain, hurting.    Causes: a) Way of doing must be corrected by expert               b) Your weight & allocation of fat problem               c) Your timing & spacing is wrong    Do a check with the expert and get it corrected.  Take good care of your back/spine, do treatment & strengthen it or else can be a long term problem.|`|4m8tTmlSaa	Probably cos you're so fat.|`|QGuxbItCaa	duh...don't do crunches.
qMwjrQbOaa	Yes, do some scotts and push-ups.|`|AFkjkqcSaa	Cardio is one of the best ways to develop stomach muscles.  No u dont have to use weights to get a 6pack.  After your training session drink a protein shake and eat protein with veg such as fish or chicken with veg to ensure that your muscles get the right fuel.  If you go on to youtube there is a personal trainer who shows you how to get results using your couch as a tool, and boy do they work!! Plenty of protein and veg in your diet will help define muscle shape.  Remember water and carbs for your cardio!!!|`|AA10339824	well, WEIGHT training?  not necessarily, unless you're including body weight into that category.  the bottom line is that you should be doing ab exercises to 'see your abs' - if you have lost enough fat around your midsection, you should see the results of some training relatively soon.  try doing 100 bicycles every day - forward and backward.  (p90x's ab ripper is a GREAT bodyweight ab routine...about 18 minutes long)    steve's right, by the way....you could scale back the cardio by 20 minutes with no adverse effects.|`|8rMgQv15aa	In order to tighten up that six pack and get it nice and cut, you should definitely do some sort of ab routine. You are really kickin *** by doin 2.5 hours of cardio every day! throwing in about 20 minutes of an ab routine would get you your 6 pack in no time at all!|`|0eN5Y0Praa	If you r a meta cafe user try to download a video titled "how to get 6 packs in 3 Min's" .  It is not about getting 6 packs in 3 Min's but if u r able to do it regularly i'm sure u'll have awesome results.(About the video the guy calls it navy swrils or something)|`|jhdpLhNcaa	If you wanna see the six packs you have to do some Abs workout. Now that you have lost the fat in your abdominal area do some sit ups, crunches and oblique to see the cuts.|`|ZRXF4hRvaa	Check your body fat %, if it is not in the single digit range, IE ( 9% ) all the training in the world will not yield a SIX PACK, the lower you body fat% the more cut you will look.
E64juLwJaa	I would suggest to you to take your husband to a urologist and have his semen checked,By the sound of it you cannot get pregnant,so I would definitely go.  Success:Planets|`|2qPtGTNcaa	Semen is mostly fluids, water, protein, electrolytes, so if it's lumpy it probably means he's not drinking enough fluids during the day or that he's chronically dehydrated. By the way, if he is eating any soy, he needs to stop. Soy reduces sperm count to the point where it can make a man techically sterile, according to new research.|`|YhZM84P1aa	A man semen can be different from what he eats. If he eats healthy it will come out clearer and thinner. If he eats blueberries that can help.|`|4vruvgzdaa	He needs to to go, and have a thorough examination from a REPUTABLE ED doctor - who can put, both his complaints  and his semen, under close observation.His past sex partners(before you)and his age, may also play a major part in the diagnosis, dear wife.|`|AA10096628	MInes is too, it's no big deal.
b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I assume you are referring to shuttle badminton.  If she is not in pain or bleeding excessively, then moderate exercise should not be a problem during her periods.  Actually, moderate exercise can help to alleviate some of the cramps that girls experience during the first days.  Medically, there is not anything she should not do, physically, unless advised by medical personnel that it would harm her.      best wishes..|`|a7Osxk2iaa	Im realy confused. Wtf|`|HWtG9dkzaa	I'm going to guess that you're referring to the game shuttle badminton.    As long as she's not in awful pain with the stomach cramps, or feeling to ill - she's fine to play.|`|cc7ffc5e6813a7e4d8ffd6e39e5556c9aa	moderate exercise is good|`|qi6a30eIaa	There's no problem with her playing what ever she wants, periods or no periods.|`|xdo49r2iaa	Hi,   She can very well any game there is no harm.|`|EMbaak9waa	You can play any sport durring your period.|`|zMNgG9m0aa	I'm sorry I can't quite understand what you're saying, except that you are not allowing your daughter to play some kind of sport/game (is it "shuttlecock"?) during her period? If she's wearing tampons there shouldn't be an issue, unless her periods are very heavy and there's a chance she'll leak and be mortified....    I'm sorry, as parents are you living in the dark ages??? What other odd things are you doing? Please keep posting here so the modern world can intervene and help you out.|`|EU1Oec8paa	why not? she can play any sports if not in pain.
xLj4nilXaa	400-500 calories|`|fynzkVK4aa	As I understand it it isn't so much how many calories are in just your lunch, but your total calorie consumption for the day which is important, along with the right balance of food groups to ensure you get the nutrients you need.    The recommended calorie intake for women is 2000 calories a day, less if you are trying to lose weight.|`|DqmIhDeZaa	Burning calories was a lot easier for me when I began experimenting with acai berry.  I understand they say that pills won't work, but they definitely worked for me, and they have been shown on CNN too. There's a free trial on right now at http://lepoceqs.ohbah.com , give it a try, what is the worst that could happen?
T1ffrjHAaa	The intake for your age and height is 1400 - 1500 calories a day. 700 IS WAY TO LOW.....|`|E3yOmel9aa	No, you will starve. At your age you have to eat at least 1400 a day, if you are active you have to eat more.|`|AA11530601	no, for an adult woman its 2000, but since you are growing at 13, you also need about 2000 a day or your growth will indeed be stunted, ur boobs will be a lot smaller etc im really not joking. If you are thinking of eating this many calories a day, I beg you to eat more. If you eat between 1500-2000, sicne thats what ur body needs each day, you wont get fat.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	700 calories is roughly a third of what you should be eating daily, depending on how active you are.|`|IHa6FxE6aa	It seems to me that you aren't eating enough. You need at least twice that.|`|qq5nceCXaa	No it's way to little you'll stop yourself growing properly and affect your body for the rest of your life.    at your age you need around 2000Kcal a day depending on your activity level, even if you're a couch potato you'll need a minimum of 1800, and as you go through puberty and growth your body will need more.    Go see your GP and get some dietary advice.  I'm sure that your mum would support you if you asked|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	It's not nearly enough. You need almost 3 times that. You are far too light for your height, you'll be sick.|`|aNwWauXzaa	In one meal, probably; in a whole day, way too few.  More like three times that is about necessary.|`|YUMqQZBzaa	That is about half of what you should be eating a day, if you are in sports or do a lot of exercising then it should be more again.|`|9ddb6f609e51d847460515fa2e1cae3daa	thats too little, you should have at least 1400 if you're not very active|`|9fec6a8704a864b61d3862874ce94967aa	Way too low! Double it and get exercise and you should stay healthy slim and fit.|`|cN6AMupIaa	not enough, you will get real sick if you do not eat enough to keep your body from succumbing to any and every bug or virus that you encounter.Eat more veg if you can for vitamins.|`|JU351q6Naa	No way you sound starving. The average calories for a normal healthy woman a dat is 2000 calories you are well below this. I know you are only 13 so you should at least be having 1400-1600 a day. please eat more. you will most likely faint and end up in hospital unconcious and they will have to feed you through a tube.|`|JjXFj2EBaa	700 calories is way too little, it's practically anorexia.  If you are worried about your body get out and exercise more, take up some sport, starving yourself is not the answer|`|2zkcZNx0aa	At your age and height you should eat 2000. You are classed as an adult food wise at your age, especially because of your height.|`|DtG4zpM2aa	In a day?  No...that's nowhere near enough.   An average female requires about 1500 calories a day and you should probably be having more than that as with that weight and height you're definitely underweight.|`|DIILQSPXaa	You need help.  I think you're anorexic, 7 1/2 stone is waay to little for a 5ft 6" girl.  And i think you know the answer to your question because you must know the recommended calories per day which is 2000. You would be eating 1300 calories too little so obv. you wouldn't be eating too much : /    Attention seeker...|`|14f6394f238bf05529f45dbf1fa9c547aa	You serious! even if you dont get out of the bed you need 1000 cals.    at your age you need 2000cals with 60 minutes of physical activity each day.|`|y7GTGVH9aa	no|`|UpFOBo7iaa	That isnt enough sweetie.    Your body will go into starvation mode.    you need 1200-1500 calories a day at the very least|`|AGTMeY7taa	no its not alot, children aged 5-10 should eat 1500 calories a day, 13 is classed as an adult so you should be eating 2000 calories a day. 7 1/2 stone is slightly underweight for your height but is fairly average on your age, really it depends on height not age. the main answer to your question is no it isn't enough.
im9fwTG5aa	i am in the same situation and have decided to take on the role of a personal trainer and treat my friend to a week of boot camp at my home hoping that my support motivation and role modeling will spur her on and keep her as a friend cos if she carries on shes gonna die i wish you luck and im looking forward to your answers in the hope they help me too x|`|2e853def177f0dc358c1df8eb4484cc5aa	there are hospitals for eating problems and special doctors
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	During orgasm a hormone called oxytocin is released that causes uterine contractions, these can help ease menstrual craps, its also common for women to use orgasm as a way of helping to induce miscarriage if trying to abort a pregnancy and to help induce periods if theyre trying to bring on a late period or get their period early. It's obviously a good way to ease stress and tension too, and activity can increase blood flow which will have a short term benefit for your skin, not to mention that it's good exercise to help burn off calories.|`|fOc6PB2Oaa	They are good for your brain|`|09zVUMBRaa	They are an excellent stress reliever.|`|Ha02Iu5Haa	it helps you get high, legally|`|eLhWgghwaa	Orgasms are good.

DON'T DO DRUGS - DO SEX!    Otherwise, no, it does nothing.    But while kissing you use every muscle in your face so it's a good excisise for double chin :p|`|ilcLGVF7aa	Orgasms are excellent. you look good and feel good.    Sex is good for your skin and your hair and weight loss.|`|a1PcWRQOaa	They ease period cramps apparantly.|`|JU351q6Naa	they are a good cure for stress. they are also good for the brain mentally. they also boost your confidence and make you feel good about yourself.
PnMtlZ0Yaa	Come over.    No, although you may want to stop to eat, shower and do other things once in a while. If it interferes with you functioning normally, you have a problem.|`|USsDzaIsaa	If it became an addiction or obsession, then yes.  However, the same can be said for any activity.

E3yOmel9aa	You need to do kegles.  http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/kegel-e...|`|jidM3Qxyaa	Squeeze like you are stopping urine flow (don't actually do this on the toilet because stopping the flow can cause infections). Do 10 quick (but strong) squeezes then hold one as long as you can, repeat 5 times. Do this regularly such as waiting for the kettle to boil, at a red traffic light, every nappy change (for new mummies) etc... Don't forget to breathe!!!!!|`|pV9NaDcaaa	You should try pilates, its great for your whole core.
GqTSa85daa	Could be water in the ear canal, ear wax, pressure on the eardrum when putting on the headphones.  Yes, It's happened to me too.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	You have to see your doctor. There could be  wax build-up inside the ear, which the doctor can irrigate.     Occasionally ears can become blocked following a head cold or illness. This is often due to an infection and will quite often need treating with medication.    In my case I needed a drainage tube.     http://www.earhelp.co.uk/EarCanalBlockag...|`|QGuxbItCaa	You forgot to put in your left hearing aid.|`|2RkDecZwaa	you probably just have fluid in your ear from the flu.|`|BkatcMZbaa	There are all kind of reasons in having hearing impairment and the best is to go to a hearing aids centre or clinic for advice & sound hearing check to find out the fault/s.  If can be corrected with aids item, is easy & good and if not possible then meet a ear specialist .....please not a doctor.    Hearing too much walkman or MP3, etc is a cause.  Working in a very noisy environment......especially sharp sound  Too much ear digging, possible tear  Avoid the aboves.............  Internal brain reaction or interruption......out of control.|`|iOI2RT6maa	Get it checked out. May be an infection / hearing loss.|`|HunSyQaSaa	if it continues for a day or so go see your doctor.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	How did you check for wax?  It can get impacted against the eardrum to where it can't be swabbed out.  If you still have problems after a couple of days, see a doctor.    Do you have the problem only when you wear headphones?  It might be the headphone and not your ear.
BNkQA2pFaa	I found this for you.  http://alcoholism.about.com/od/meds/a/an...|`|Vhq3GURQaa	It is an effective deterrent IF you take it. Because you have been drinking your sugar levels have been high. Any cravings you feel for alcohol may actually be your bodies calling for sugar. Do a bit of research on a supplement called chromium. It may help with this..|`|8j70Neqeaa	i have been on it. its a good deterant,one thing do not drink on it .I did and i swear i thought i was going to die.give it a couple days before you do.im 49 and finally gave it up , just got sick and tired of being sick. it was killing me and did not want to die that way.been clean 4 plus years now and never been happier. tip  i quit on my own,, had a life of hell,its really easy when you want it bad. good luck

Hang in there!|`|1rNVgEDIaa	It seems you are down with viral tracheo-laryngitis. Take some anti-pyretic [Paracetamol] and 500mg of Vitamin C ; additionally please gargle wwith lukewarm saline water thrice a day. Viral infection leads to bronchitis and you may take antibiotics only to prevent secondary bacterial infection. Viral diseases are time-limited and you should be well within 3-5 days or you will be having complications.
0rF1be2baa	i just wanna say going on a no carb diet is stupid. carbohydrates are essential to the body and cutting it out isnt a healthy way to lose weight. i can't see whats wrong with eating a bit less that you were before and exercising regularly. also i would jog or even walk both are exellent healthy ways to lose weight. eat healthy exercise is the way to go. and healthy means having carbohydrates, proteins, vitimins etc. the thing about a diet is that you'll lose wieght quickly but because a diet is temporary if you go back to the way you were before you'll put the weight back on.
BdlGBdE5aa	No.  The temperature needed to kill bacteria is higher than the temperature of a hot dringk, such as coffee.  If you heat the hot drink hot enough to kill the bacteria you will also injure the tongue tissue. The best way to remove the bacteria from your tongue is to clean your tongue.  I use an OraBrush tongue cleaner because it has both a soft brush and a scraper.  Use some mouthwash and the OraBrush and clean your tongue when you brush your teeth.  It just takes a few seconds to clean your tongue and you will get rid of the bacteria as well as have fresh mouth.|`|xhjSPd0uaa	i dont think so coz you wouldnt drink a drink thats at boiling point coz you'd scold ur mouth badly. an its boiling point that kills most germs.    for bad breath, drink some lemon juice!! really works, gets rid of all odours, might make your face screw up for a minit but its worth it lol x|`|WQxTQSMEaa	I dont think soo|`|1rNVgEDIaa	In your mouth, hot drinks don't either stay for that much duration say 20 minutes or are hot enough say 90 degree Celsius to eleiminate germs. The better option is to gargle with betadine mouthwash to kill them!! A cheaper option is to gargle with lukewarm saline water!!!|`|B3gREJOEaa	No it doesn't .Plaque needs more high temp. to be removed.
hBmafVYoaa	I think first hand, due to the risk of oral cancer. Obviously there are many many risks too but oral cancer (in this instance)is from doing the smoking not passive.|`|et39TGIsaa	Definitely first-hand smoking since you put the cigarette in your mouth and inhale the smoke.  Second-hand smoke is residual.|`|fCgfReMiaa	both! first hand is worse obviously thats why ive given up today and im going cold turkey.|`|8Hlvv8a4aa	There is no such thing as second hand smoking. That's just the propaganda spewing from the anti-smoking do gooders. It's the equivalent of breathing while sitting in traffic.    First hand is the only hand and the only danger.
zMNgG9m0aa	oh you poor thing, why on earth hasn't your mum noticed? I still remember this moment in my life (some 24 years ago now). Just go buy yourself a crop top. Simple. Your mum will see it and you'll have a conversation about things and it will all be sorted.    Or save yourself the money and have the conversation and make her buy it!  She'll probably buy you a few, and who knows what else she'll spring for on this mother/daughter bonding shopping trip? She's probably not thinking of bras yet, you guys just grow up too fast for us mums sometimes. But a crop top thing might ease her into the idea.    If she says no I'd still go out and buy yourself one. She's clearly out of touch.    So either way you'll get what you want, it's just a matter of who pays for it. :) good luck and go for it!|`|USsDzaIsaa	Just tell her what you've told us.  Trust me!

Good Luck!  ?jaylynn?|`|0t1QOKGVaa	Just ask her, she went through the same thing when she was your age. If you can't build up the courage to ask her.

AA11020187	Survival rates are based on statistics. For stage 4 melanoma the median survival is 6-7 months from diagnosis. This means half the people diagnosed with stage 4 are still alive in 6-7 months. Some have died at 1-2 months and others are alive at 9-10 months. The data for these statistics have been kept for a very long time and are very accurate.     If those 16 lymph nodes were regional to the tumor in his back it means the cancer is somewhere else too. Melanoma has a tendency to metastasize to the GI tract and I suspect this is why he had a colonoscopy. You need to know the findings from that exam. If mets where found there they could cause bleeding and/or obstruction and could make his time a little less.    Once he is in hospice they will be able to help him, you and the rest of your family with all of your issues and will be able to give you a little better time line as the get to know him. Best wishes to all of you.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Yes, that time frame is fairly accurate.  I do hope the poor man is not in great pain...|`|7eb3fd3226605d4f11ad285a2b5a5ab4aa	"Time lines" such as you are seaking are only averages andcan be very inaccurate.    If you have been given a time line of 6 months, then that is a likely time frame, but anything from a week to years is possible.
WpqfQOTJaa	Is your penis head really big? maybe that's what it is. The head is too big and the foreskin can't fit around it.    But when in doubt, go to the doctor. There's a tiny little medical procedure where they can fix it so it doesn't hurt anymore.  When you do go to the doctor, you'll be glad you did. And don't worry showing the doctor your ok, he's seen more than you can even imagine.    But congrats on being 15 and having a 7 incher! That thing's gonna get bigger to by the time you're 18.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	This is about tight foreskin: http://circresearch.googlepages.com/tigh...

The best solution is to try to start stretching the foreskin you can look it up on google. If you are pulling it back more than it needs to be than i would suggest not doing it if its causing harm. The best thing might also to be showing it to your doctor. They are trained for this kind of stuff.. But don't allow them to cut it off.. alot of doctors for some reason like to do this even though there are alot of solutions for this kind of problem and getting circumsized can cause problems later in life.
p3NsXo0baa	What is your height? If you look up google and type in BMI CALCULATOR, enter your details and im certain your body is righ ton track. Im 19 and had a baby 6 months ago. I put on 25kgs during my pregnancy but hav elost it all. Im 5"7 and only weigh 47kgs :( I feel horrible and my bones and muslces hurt cos im so skinny. I can feel my ribs so easily, lost nearly all of my boobs and can even feel all my lymph nodes im  that skinny.  No one else see's it but i truely feel horrible. Not as in how i look,but how i feel inside.    My goal is too reach 55-60kgs asap, im drinking lots of sustagen and ensure.   Please dont try and lose weight, your at the perfect size!! Even if you think your 2-5kgs overweight for your body shape, keep it!! Its always good to have a few extra kgs incase you get sick and lose weight from being run down.    Ive alwya sbeen skinny but im just use to being big from my pregnancy|`|6lmFyr2maa	how tall are you, 60kg is a perfect weight for me and im 5'7  when i dropped to 55 my periods stopped becuase i was too thin.    xxx|`|USsDzaIsaa	Unless you're very short, 55-60 kgs is perfectly fine.

Google 'BMI calculator' and put your details in there to see if you are within the healthy weight range..    having said that, I understand if it turns out that you are a healthy weight for your height but still want to lose weight. I do. Peole dont get it, its annoying. Im 5"11 and my BMI is 18.5 - right on the border of underweight and normal, btu I still think I'd look so much better if I lost a bit.    I guess just up the amount of cardiovascular exercise you do [running, swimming, power walking] and watch what you eat.    Good luck!
hBmafVYoaa	If you have fever and a sore throat you may have a cold/flu. Sadly this has come at the time of your period. Not nice but there is very little you can do. Get some rest and the fever and sore throat should dissapear soon. Drink plenty and take some painkillers if you need to. Sadly just a fact of life.|`|g2h6qUUXaa	take some midol it will help|`|yH4y44Q6aa	put a heat pack over your tummy/abdo where the cramps are - this helps a lot, and lie down.

E3yOmel9aa	If you eat 800-1000 calories a day you will lose weight. When you go off this diet you will gain it all back unless you continue to starve yourself. You need at least 1200 calories a day, more if you are more active.
evfsiU4Xaa	During your period?    Yes of course, everyone has lighter and heavier days.    Dont worry about it.    If you made a typing error and your NOT on your period, then this could be anything. Talk to your mum or even a doctor.|`|zMNgG9m0aa	yep. you could have done something to disrupt your cycle, perhaps it will do this for a few months. I've found over the years my cycle changes in the "type" of period I have. It was very heavy in my teens, settled down in my 20s, although was frequently late and off cycle, and then pregnancies etc etc messed it around again.  just keep a note on a calendar or something, you might make sense of it that way.

evfsiU4Xaa	When was your last period? If you are late or have missed one, go to the doctors for a proper test and to talk to him/her about your symtoms too.    If your periods are fine, bare in mind that some women still have them while they're pregnant. But other than that I really don't know what this could be.    Good luck!|`|QJdXg6p9aa	That that you have listed all are 100 % pregnancy symptoms if you are not confident and do not trust tests for pregnancy then I advise to you to address to the gynecologist|`|zMNgG9m0aa	go to a doctor, their tests are more accurate.  urinating frequently doesn't happen until you're 12 weeks though, and vomitting usually stops around then. how's your balance? your brainpower? your ligaments?    it's also possible you were pregnant and miscarried?|`|yH4y44Q6aa	Period pain or a Urinary Tract Infection|`|jidM3Qxyaa	I was urinating quite frequently from about 6 weeks pregnant until about 17 weeks then got a break until the last trimester. I guess everyone is different. I don't know what is wrong with you but I would tend to believe negative pregnancy tests. Those things are pretty accurate these days. But to be sure I'd go and see your doctor and get a blood test done. They can also run a number of other tests to see what is going on. Good luck.|`|hVzfCxnOaa	No, actually, I would have to say you are pregnant. You might not have to go to a doctor, however. You should go to a clinic or something. Usually they're pretty helpful. Otherwise, i'd give it another week and take another pregnancy test.

I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was theweightlossplace.com -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.

Eku8XD2Gaa	no not at all, rather studies reveal that masturbation prevents prostate cancer.|`|5TwZeeFPaa	Sorry have to do this, Brian Boy dude don't give us this crap about it being bad for you, its been PROVEN that it reduces prostate cancer so don't be going around feeding people crap about it being bad for you cause it certainly isnt for both genders!|`|ccvxxnScaa	no, masturbation and sex, ejaculation is actually good for the prostate.|`|oluB6ClPaa	it's not that bad.|`|PAvYZJK2aa	it is actually good for you|`|IHa6FxE6aa	No. It actually has been proven that masturbation helps reduce the risk of prostate cancer.|`|K4zsztkRaa	Studies have shown that men who ejaculate 21 times or more per month have a decreased risk of getting prostat cancer and prostate problems.  It's good for you. It's impossible for it to be bad, you are flushing out the prostata when you ejaculate that's always a healthy thing never a bad thing.    Plus how is your body going to know you are masturbating?  What's it gonna do? Go "oh crap he's masturbating again let's cause problems"  Your body can't tell the diference between sex or masturbation, or just getting pleasure. It's just responding to stimulus. That's all.  Masturbation causes NOTHING bad.    -Connor|`|E64juLwJaa	No it is the other way around:masturbating can help prevent you getting prostate cancer later in life.  Planets|`|2SSD6BP9aa	It's actually good for your prostate.  It decreases your risk of getting prostate cancer.    There was some confusion about this because there were other studies done that seemed to show men who ejaculated more frequently were at higher risk of prostate cancer.  The difference was that those studies either included or were mainly done on promiscuous men - who had many sex partners.  Having many sex partners increases your chances of getting certain STDs like the HPV virus, which definitely increases your risk of prostate cancer.    But frequent ejaculations through masturbation, or in a monogamous relationship, reduces the risk.|`|wPW7NZegaa	Hey!    Oh, twice a day is bad for everything. I suppose you don't want to get uncontrolable ejaculations and pee on the street. Nor shaking hands or hazy mind.    You'll see how many messages like: "wawsh, do it, do it, feell it, enjoy!" you'll get. That's because some men think that it feels pleasurable then it has no harm on you. Wrong!    I think you should start to reduce the frequency to once a week.  It's like a drug and you noticed that. You feel tired, hazy mind, lazy, and probably shaking hands, aren't yo?. Well, if you don't stop you'll get those things permanently. Of course, everyone will hate you.   Masturbation is not normal as many say (they don't want to be alone).    Maybe you're courios about how do you feel after (they are side efffects not just sensations)...  see here:    http://herballove.com/library/resource/o...

V2l05Hhsaa	as some one has already said correct that you should consult your doctor and not to rely on the online info 95% is not so reliable. But make sure you check with your insurance too.    If you really want some information online then I would suggest you google and read as much as info you can.  or read some articles like these to gain knowledge on the dental insurance http://dentalinsuranceplanscompare.com/i...|`|VerfhAQcaa	You should call your dental insurance and ask if they cover an implant, and how much they cover. Most dental companies cover 50%, I know mine did|`|QackgSL3aa	Maybe You should try to google it first ,nonetheless, if you prefer some direct resource ,here http://www.InsuranceFreeTip.info/insuran...  might be helpful.
zMNgG9m0aa	i didn't like them. too fluffy.
VerfhAQcaa	You should look into the company that makes the medicine. Sometimes they have programs to help pay for your medication, or you can get it for free. I get my bipolar medicine for free from the company that makes it because I am low income. But if you need to find out how much a prescription costs, just call the pharmacy and ask them.|`|AA12072674	Walmart, Target, and some other place I can't remember have a list of drugs that cost $10 for a 30-day supply. On that list is Celexa, which in reality is the same thing as Lexapro.    The only thing that Forest laboratories did to make Lexapro was remove an inert benzine ring from Celexa. They did that so that because the FDA says that in order to patent a new drug under a new name, the drug can only have around 60% (maybe 65% I can't remember) of the original formula.     Long story short - if you can afford one visit to your MD or go to a public health clinic, you can ask to be switched to Celexa (and the MD will be fine with that, I assure you) without difficulty and be able to continue your meds.|`|KNnwUcpqaa	My insurance co doesn't pay for Lexapro for some reason. I found that out when the dr prescribed a 30 day 10 mg supply & Walmart said the insurance didn't go through. It was 100 for the month. This was a yr ago so im not sure what it would be now.|`|FfxmE9Toaa	Yikes. I pay $40 per month for the same dose at a pharmacy. Wal Mart won't be much cheaper for you. The answer above me about contacting the manufacturer is the best course.|`|e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	You can just call walmart's pharmacy closest to you to find out how much they charge.  And I agree that you should call the maker of Lexapro to see if they have a program for the uninsured.  If all of that doesn't help, call your doctor, and get some samples, and ask her/him to change your meds to something that will work close to what Lexapro, but is a generic.  They will understand.
IHa6FxE6aa	Consult your doctor and he/she will prescribe a proper diet and exercise regime for you.|`|AA11344263	First eat healthy. For sure, cut out fatty foods, especially fried food. Watch what you eat, and be aware of your calorie intake. But do not, ever, count calories. It is unhealthy. For snacking, replace any sugary foods such as cakes, cookies, and other stuff or salty foods like chips with fruits. Avoid snacking. If you really want to snack, grab an apple.  Personally, I don't eat any dinner, but it is fine if you do eat dinner. You can eat veggies and low-fat milk at night. Avoid 'heavy' foods such as pasta and meat at dinner.    But if you eat in a balanced diet but do not exercise the attempt will take a very very long time. You also have to exercise at least three to four times a week. You can run outdoors or go to the gym if you want. I usually burn 500 calories four times a week (running 30 minutes, steppers 20 minutes, and light weight-exercise 20 minutes). But if it is your first time exercising, try to at least burn 300 calories to take effect.  Don't push yourself too hard if you can't reach 500 calories. It took me seven months to gain strength to burn 300 calories until 500 calories.     If you feel tired of exercising, it's okay to stop. Remember, never give up! :)|`|ZlfPl6B1aa	depending on your weight & height you have to cut out about 500 calories from your daily meal in order to loose 1 lb a week.

After that I will brush my teeth, floss my teeth, mouthwash my mouth and maybe stick on lip chap if my lips are chapped so i know for sure my mouth area is fresh. It is always important to keep a clean shave going as well. Nothing says I take care of myself like a nice clean chin. Ummm... Q-tips. I use Q-tips in my ears AND my nose. Just sort of wrap around the inner walls of your nose while twisting to accumulate unwanted nose trash. Dispose. Another thing that makes you look is 100% clean laundry. Gotta have clean clothes.

m16dhfrGaa	Are these open pores that fill up with dirt and soap, or are they little infected pimples?  If open pores then one thing that might help is one of the skin scrub things, like a gentle scouring pad, I can't remember what they are called.  If they are infected pimples then you could add some tea tree oil to body lotion and rub that in a couple of times a week.  Look up tea tree oil, it's really effective.  I don't know which country you are in but it should be readily available.      Also, I don't know about your diet but typically teenagers are fond of burgers and fries.  Cut down on the junk food.  It contains fats and chemicals that you body may not be dealing with too well.   Check out foods that are good for skin.  Take a multivitamin every day.

Eku8XD2Gaa	your friend has nothing to worry about, masturbation is normal and natural, read on the link and pass on to your friend as well , this will settle down his curiosities  http://www.socyberty.com/Sexuality/25-My...|`|oluB6ClPaa	well.. there's nothing much you can do since it has been for the past nine years... you can keep him busy so that the idea of masturbating doesn't come into his mind and so that he'd get used to not masturbating as often. cause i know myself that guys masturbate when they have nothing to do.|`|E64juLwJaa	He has nothing to worry about:I think that you do not know the facts and are worried over nothing.  Planets.|`|AA11445608	your "friend" has nothing to worry about|`|wPW7NZegaa	Hi there!    I want to help you. Why? Because I know many men who has masturbated and now they are suffering so much.  Masturbation has side effects. It's like a drug and you probably have noticed that.    Please be aware of the following: As much you masturbate as much you'll feel the need to do it again.    70% it is psychological   30% is is biological    You know how good it feels, but it's very tricky.  I will give you a link to read stories about men who are suffering right now from masturbating.    My tips:    * try to leave all behind. Close your eyes and imagine you go far away of this problem. (You can imagine the problem like a black box. You close it and just throw it away, you go far away from it)    * masturbation makes you loose you confidence and wilpower.  You can do it, you CAN overpass this problem. Have willpower and set yourself this goal.    * once you said: "I left this behind." don't think on sex and all the stuff related to it. Forget about sex. It is behind and far away.    * avoid seeing porn or TV shows about that. Even comercials who contain just few seconds there who can remember you about it.    * Masturbation is not moral, is not normal. Imagine all the people in your house masturbating. Wouldn't be soooo weird?  Some doctors say is good to seel theirs lubs    *if you notice you've started to think on sex, then rapidly think on smth else. Not working? Do something imediately. Something creatively, I don't knw helping your parents doing something or something ele that requires from you to think on something else.    * if you get an errection, do the above recommendation    * if there is no other thing to do and you have an errection and feel like crazy try to find a solution. DO NOT TOUCH your penis or anything down there.    * if you don't touch it everything will come to normal at some time.  ________  Please be aware you might get wet dreams (have an ejaculation during sleep and get up soo wet.)  Don't be dissapointed. This is normal 1 time at each 3 weeks. However if you have masturbated recently (which I hope this won't happen any more) you might have more frequent wet dreams.    I told you that because if you managed not to do it for about 2 weeks and then have a wet dream, to be dissapointed and masturbate. Wet dreams are normal. Masturbation is abnormal!    You deserve more.   After you quit this habbit you will have a good life again. Thrust me, it is so much better not to masturbate. You will feel yourself living and not so lethargic.    I hope you'll stop doing this.  ! If for some reason you have masturbated during this period of quitting don't get dissapointed. It's still very good you have reduced the frequency of it.    OH! Go and pee before you go to bed. This way you will avoid wet dreams and errections.    BE AWARE. As much you masturbate as much you feel a greater urge to do it.    See each day like an achievement.  E-mail me if you need live assistance.    Here you can read some stories of men, boys like you who now suffer because they masturbated or masturbate.    See if he is already in danger: http://herballove.com/library/resource/o...|`|CWlKnQPuaa	Am i right in saying there is no friend it is you who needs the help.|`|rKg81fzRaa	your friend has nothing to worry about, completely natural!|`|ImENOklEaa	look dude, it dose not matter how much this guy pounds the salimi, refcent studies show that if you do it 20-30 times a day it wil prolong your lifespan,  so if you ask me he shoul do it more!!!
TKNPveHDaa	You can buy pepper at any grocery store.  It looks like garlic powder, but it's red.    Second, all that stuff is crap.  Cleansing?  Explain to me how pepper and maple syrup cleanse your body.  It makes no sense.    I grew up in the house of a registered dietitian and the ONLY way to cleanse your body is by drinking water and eating fiber.  You do those two things and I promise you'll be cleansed.  Salt water?  Starving?  Pepper?  Maple syrup?  No way.  That doesn't work.

XBH61aAIaa	Try boosting your calorie intake to 1100. You are very tall and at a healthy weight, so your body may be holding onto the calories as if you're trying to starve yourself. Your body, if not properly nuriushed will go into what they call (appropriately) "starvation mode." So, when you do that, your body will hold onto everything you eat. If you up your calories to 1,100, you may have more luck.|`|AA10617489	It's not always how much you are eating but what you are eating.  Items that are high in complex carbohydrates take longer to burn, these are things like white rice, white bread, potatoes.       I found I started losing a lot of weight when I switched to whole grain foods that have more fiber.  Multi-grain bread, brown rice, whole grain pasta, wheat tortillas.  Also when I cut down on the amount of carbs per meal.  Check your packages and see how many carbohydrates in the bread and rice.  Try to stay within 60 grams of  carbs per meal.     Also eating more often helps increase your metabolism your meals are fairly small which is good.  But I'd add a snacks between every meal, bananas, apples, yogurt make great low cal snacks.  It seems like you already to that a bit.  Try to eat something every 2 hours,  If breakfast is at 8:00am, have an apple at 10:00am, and lunch at 12:00pm.  You only want to intake about 100-200 calories less than you burn.  Significantly more than that your metabolism slows down and you start to keep fat no matter what.    Also you don't seem to have a lot of vegetables in your diet.  Increasing the amount of vegetables is great.  There are a lot of fiber in vegetables so it makes you feel full.  It doesn't always have to be salads, but steamed, or stir fried with chicken and lemon-pepper or other seasoning can make a great meal.     A great tool I've used is my pyramid tracker to make sure I've had enough of each food group and still keep my intake less than my output.   You  can put in your food and your activity and see what your energy balance is for the day.  http://www.mypyramidtracker.gov/Default....    If none of this works you may want to see a doctor or dietitian.  I had a similar problem and found out I actually had a metabolic problem.

ixPVr23Waa	Its best to see your local pharmacist and ask this question since they are the experts when it comes to medicines.    It is also not advisable to give kids cough medicine as they stop the the coughing up of sputum and phlegm causing it to settle in the lungs making infections worse.    Simple childrens paracetamol/tylenol should help with any fever, sore throat or irritability. It sounds like old news but keep up the fluids and ensure plenty of rest.

oojO4WAraa	I think it is very important.  Some kids do okay without breakfast, but most do better with it.  Some cannot concentrate when they are hungry.  Others just don't retain what they have learned.  Food is fuel for the brain.  If you are not getting proper nutrition your brain isn't operating at peak capacity.|`|wEbB1FuNaa	I dont eat breakfast or lunch but i have straight A's so i would say nothing.

Cause my mother fed me right I still got a learn ability.|`|8CL8o8K0aa	Your brain needs to be nourished in order to function well.  If you are anemic for example, you will be sluggish and more inclined to sleep.  If you are full of energy then you will be more incline to study.
LqvX5whyaa	Heya,  This could very well be due to the braces, but im thinking its more the weather to be honest cause it is cold out there and it can dry out some lips and make them chapped. Try some Vaseline them ones in the little tubs and they are green one like this:  http://www.britsuperstore.com/acatalog/V... ( but the packaging is green - thats the one your looking for).  And keep applying that it should really help you, and keep drinking water. If your lips are still sore after about a week i would get some advise from your local pharmacy.

Plus the weather is shocking at the mo which does wreck your skin - try slapping on loads of vaseline before bed!|`|K6R8VO6baa	It probably is related to the braces. When I had braces I tried to keep chap stick on all the time cause normally when you go to the orthodontist they always seem to pull your cheeks and lips a lot.   My advice is to always keep vaseline on hand and on your lips, and drink lots of water. The moister in your body will help that.
cPRuJQ1Paa	I had my lap band surgery through Forerunners Healthcare Consultants in India I don't regret it at all I had a baby since then and I'm still able to take the weight off so far i am very happy. The key is to use a reputable surgeon. You want to be carefully screened beforehand to make sure you are a good candidate. Since my surgery I can walk without getting tired, I can play with my son; I can walk down the street with my head held high. I feel pretty for the fist time in years. I was given another shot at life. The surgery is a tool and how well that tool works is up to you!!    I would do it again in a heartbeat. I would recommend to every one who is suffering from the same problems as I did before but I would urge anyone who is interested to seek the best surgeon possible and make the decision based on the surgeons recommendations and your own personal goals!! Make sure the reasons for the surgery are the right one. The surgery isn't for someone who just "wants to be skinny". Do it for your health, for your life, for family. FOR YOU.    You can checkout their website.  http://www.forerunnershealthcare.com  Hope this helps.|`|E64juLwJaa	I have not had it done but know people who have.

Know a few who had it done and they had real bad problems. I had the Roux n y not sure of the spelling. I lost 165 lbs, and have had no troubles other then you can't eat sweets. Know of plenty that had it done and have had troubles, and i had a cousin that died at 30 from having it done. I believe it is really a individual thing. As i said i have had no real trouble, and would do it again. I had to do a lot of classes, and show i was really going to try as i had to lose weight before hand, and have to still stay in touch with the center in Maine where i had it done. I live in Florida now still and the weight center in Maine still follows my weight. Im turning 60 next month and had it done in Dec of 06. Hope this helps you. You must be sure it is what you want and your doing it for you. You will see shrinks before hand, and it is a life changing ateration. Good Luck!  Steve

Your arms burn while lifting because you are pushing them harder. If you are weight training and looking for BIG arms, then you should continue lifting until they "burn" because this means that your muscles are ripping (in a good way) because you are over working them. In order for muscles to grow they need to rip, and when the rips heal they heal with more muscle mass, which makes your muscles bigger. P    Personally when I'm working out (to get more muscle) I make it a point to work out until my muscles can't take it anymore. And I love it when I am still feeling it when I wake up in the morning because that means you are healing which also means your muscles are getting bigger!     At some point you will find that even though you push yourself to the limits, you wont feel as sore later on. This is because you need to switch up your workout routines in order to work different parts of your muscles, so one part of your muscle isn't the only part being worked out and getting used to your routine.    I hope that helps!   Good luck!

Sorry.|`|EZt7ZHIiaa	Hi there, I am sorry to hear about these difficulties you have been having.  It is very common for something like a small fear to start manifesting itself as a greater and greater fear until it starts to spiral out of control, which seems to be the point in which you are at now.  Being reclusive and confined to the house doesn't help either when you are only left to deal with your own thoughts all day.  One of the best ways to start to combat this problem, as someone suggested, is to just start small with a little at a time.  Sometimes it can be hard to even know where to start.  If you are interested in trying to sort this out, I am a professional therapist and do provide professional online counseling for these types of issues.  The occupational therapist may be a big help as far as just getting you back on track in society, but would probably work best if done in conjunction with some real therapeutic work.  Feel free to check out the link on my profile if you are interested.  I definitely wish you the best of luck.    Ryan
5ZayH6h6aa	If you don't live in Singapore or Iceland you can safely import Swedish snus for your own use.     Swedish snus from Swedish Match is available in selected stores in USA and South Africa as well. You can find a store in those countries here: http://www.swedishsnus.com/US/storelocat...    If you never tried snus before, I suggest you try a flavored variant (like mint or eucaluptus).|`|6QmDm8iwaa	well unfortunately if this product you speak of is not legal then i would not buy it. number one now every site tracks your computer IP address so thats a bad idea all together|`|c3VXP2Iyaa	Keep smoking, this is my advice.   because being a snus addicted person does not mean that you have a slightly less disgusting habit.. because, snus tastes like **** and it makes your teeth black.. Snus does not hurt your lungs because it is smokeless, but a snus bag contains much much more nicotine than what a cigarette contains, which means a higher damage to your brain cells..   so, you decide now what is more important to you!   of course I am kidding when I am saying keep smoking, wish that you will quit soon :)
ZkuYBUByaa	It depends on the severity of the UTI.  For milder cases you do not have to go to doctor, I had a minor one and with at home treatments I cured it myself.  Uptake your water intake, drink the minimum recommend and then some (but don't over do it).  Then buy some pure cranberry juice.  Pure meaning not at the grocery store where the cranberry juice is full of sugar, try going to a health food store.  Then go to walmart and buy AZO, its near the vitamins.  I haven't personally taken AZO but my best friend says it works.

AA12266052	Tonsillitis may be caused by Group A streptococcal bacteria, resulting in strep throat. Viral tonsillitis may be caused by numerous viruses such as the Epstein-Barr virus (the cause of infectious mononucleosis) or the Adenovirus.  Infectious mononucleosis is caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV, human herpesvirus type 4), characterized by fatigue, fever, pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. Fatigue may persist weeks or months. Severe complications, including splenic rupture and neurologic syndromes, occasionally occur. Diagnosis is clinical or with heterophil antibody testing. Treatment is supportive.  A sore throat can make you miserable. These tips can help.      * Drink more fluids. Warm liquids  such as soup, broth and tea  are good choices.      * Gargle with warm salt water. Mix 1/4 teaspoon of salt in 8 ounces of warm water, gargle, and then spit out the water.      * Use honey and lemon. Stir honey and lemon to taste into a glass of hot water. Allow it to cool to room temperature before you sip it. The honey coats and soothes your throat, and the lemon helps reduce mucus. Don't use honey or corn syrup in a drink for children younger than age 1.      * Suck on a throat lozenge or hard candy. This stimulates saliva production, which bathes and cleanses your throat.      * Humidify the air. Adding moisture to the air can reduce throat irritation and make it easier to sleep. Be sure to change the water in a room humidifier daily and clean the unit at least once every three days to help prevent the growth of harmful molds and bacteria.      * Avoid smoke and other air pollutants. Smoke irritates a sore throat.      * Rest your voice. Talking may lead to more throat irritation and temporary loss of your voice (laryngitis).  Think about others, too. If you're not feeling well, take a few days off to avoid spreading your germs.   My answer contains basic information only. If you are concerned about your health, you should consult a doctor.|`|0eb5efa701843dadf3c5e74ac84a930baa	Could be Strep throat.|`|TGuyq4sGaa	Really i would say worrying about it alot causes stress which will make it swell more. But you do have to watch out for mroe signs and just how its recovering but to me doesnt sound soo serious but really anything can happen. But dont Worry a WHOLE Lot|`|AA11321694	please go and see a doctor ASAP ... symptoms suggestive of tonsillitis.    You may be able to ease throat pain by gargling with salt water, drinking warm tea, and using other home treatments.    GOOD LUCK !!!

n560blqraa	In this particular case of your dream you state it is you dreaming about your Uncle doing drugs , not YOU which makes the interpretation very different. In your first response of this post a woman states how this dream would be interpreted as a  quick fix. However, this is inaccurate being that in your dream YOU are not the drug user; your Uncle is which makes the interpretation very different. As a lack of a drug user is it no longer personal or a quick fix. When you dream of someone else's drug use, i.e. your Uncle it takes on a different meaning altogether. It is usually indicative of needing healing and about achieving balance in ones life. Being that it is your Uncle it can be related to imbalance within your family life and the necessary healing that needs to take place within your family currently.|`|BuJIQ8Jhaa	too much importance are attached to dreams.  Your brain is sorting  out your concerns about everything that has happened.  You already have the best answer to your question,  and it's in your details.|`|iybezfi6aa	When you dream, all people in the dream represent different parts of yourself.   I am going to go out on a limb here and guess that there is a decision you have to make about something and you know that you are going to have to make it by yourself.|`|wX5xoAN8aa	Here is the meaning for dreaming about drugs.     To dream that you are in possession of or taking drugs, signifies your need for a "quick fix". You may be turning to a potentially harmful alternative as an instant escape from your problems. Ask yourself why you need the drugs. What do you hope the drugs will achieve for you?    Hope this helps.|`|JupD4mQYaa	'Reality is for people who cant handle drugs' see wich one best fits you and use it wisely . thanks|`|hclmWIzmaa	Hey I was there too!|`|3wy5kMU5aa	Honestly, you could just be really concerned about this person, or even a little peaved... Or you could be suspecting something that your concious doesn't want to realize.. Either way, you are doing the right thing by being concerned, and you should tell this person how much you care about them and are there for them, without accusing, and maybe they will come to you if anything is going on.  Sounds like you are a good friend.
AA12198724	I know how you feel have you considered zinc toothpaste or adopting zinc into your lifestyle (the tablet)? Also it could be what your brushing your teeth with. I had the same problem, my sister said my breath smelled like s**t whenever she came over. I started using crest pro health toothpaste and scope mouthwash but also use the Oral  B pus whitening electric toothbrush (8 bucks at drug store). But visit a dentist for a proper diagnosis and talk to him about zinc, or you can research it online and buy some at the local riteaid. But you shouldnt let odor cause you to quit your job. I had an odor problem as well and it was awful and I quit school and work for a semester and I started to isolate myself and i became depressed. I know its hard but sometimes you have to just stick with it or try not to stand out much.|`|sjN15kx6aa	you should go to a dentist|`|DshFTbcsaa	See a doctor, there could be a chemical imbalance in your stomach causing the bad breath. This is common, and you can treat this fairly easily. I hope this helps, Best of luck!     http://ezinearticles.com/?Stomach-Bacter...  This link will give you some more information|`|2qPtGTNcaa	My heart goes out to you. But you really can fix this. You have to have your teeth professionally cleaned every six months, no exceptions. You also have to floss every day, in addition to doing the things you already do (brushing your tongue and avoiding onions and garlic). Good luck to you.|`|HPpdcAtAaa	It sounds like you have halitosis, chronic bad breath.      Mayo Clinic has some good tips on what to do for bad breath:  http://www.webmd.com/oral-health/guide/c...

Good luck!|`|ReX5PzOZaa	Im not really sure if this is a question someone just posted so they could say "breath smells like poop", but if you are serious halitosis is a real medical condition and you should seek medical attention!|`|DO8fiv18aa	Have you had your tonsils extracted?-- if so you might have some decaying flesh in your throat-- happened to my brother.      It could be something to do with GERD.  Do you have heartburn?    I would suggest going to see your dentist if you havent in a while, it might be a decaying tooth.
JMOLRKRraa	This might be coming from your stomach, or esophagus. See a dentist, see a doctor for medical reasons. Look at your diet, any herbs or supplements you are taking. I would be more concerned with health. It is no reason to quit a job, especially when it is a health issue. In retail there is a big counter between you and customer, interaction is brief, people can endure your breath that long. Do you smoke? Do you have cancer? Gum disease? Stomach Ulcer? Throat cancer?  Do phone sales. Computer data entry. And screw anyone else that complains. Wear perfume, maybe that will give you a cushion from coworkers until you can sort it out. No money go to free health clinic. Go to dentistry school.|`|xkxpkvXZaa	go to the dentist and chew gum!|`|X8FXb7Opaa	Start by going to a dentist. Like Joshua stated, you may have an underlying problem like a bad tooth or an infection. Mouthwash and brushing go a  long way to helping this problem.|`|IzDMmSBtaa	You did not need to quit your job if it is a health reason they can not use your health against you.  Go to the Doctor asap and get that job back..    Go to your doctor asap.  Your breath could be from your stomach a problem there and or something in tour throat...  Be sure to get help right away.  This will get worst before it gets any better so go...    If you do not health care go to a free clinic and do not take simple answers from doctor to resolve this get to the bottom of it.    Get your teeth cleaned every six months and ask about this there.  Could be a tooth abysses or tooth loss  it is just not healthy.  Also a endoscope of your throat could show a cyst or swelling pocket in your throat.  So get medical help and get it soon.  Good luck and chew lots of gum and use good moth wash but GET HELP.. Good luck|`|6Bjjm9xbaa	try a product that does more than cover up bad breath odor like trioral.    you can purchase this 2 step solution from qvc shopping channel.  also, go to the qvc website and search for this item and read testimonials/product info.    tri-oral products the breath for 12 hours.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	You are very concerned about a problem that most people have, bad breath.  The major cause of bad breath is a bacteria that is on the top of your tongue and produces bad smells.  Look at the top of your tongue for some "white stuff". This is the bacteria and must be removed if you are to get rid of bad breath.  Mints and gums just cover up bad breath for a very short time.  I use a tongue cleaner called OraBrush along with some mouthwash to clean my tongue every time I brush my teeth.  It only takes a few seconds and is very effective in getting rid of bad breath.|`|kA0xb0MVaa	Bad breath is the sign of a few health conditions.  Have you seen a doctor about this?  And ignore the first contributor's answer.  That was rude and completely uncalled for.    The dentist has an arsenal of special products that may help you if your health care provider says your health is fine.|`|Oq7CAayZaa	first of all learn to speak and second have you thought about brushing your teeth? use mints and gum.|`|oGthpoEsaa	If breath really stinks all the time not matter what then you might have an infected tooth that just doesn't hurt yet. Decay into the tooth pulp causes your mouth to smell like something is rotting because there literally is a rotting tooth in your mouth. I'd go to a dentist and tell them about the smell and have them take a look.
HPpdcAtAaa	I don't know how long you have to go to school for it in Australia, but in the States since you want to be able to prescribe medicine, you have to go to med school, which is four years and then you have a training of residency for three years and then you have a few more years of training in your specialty, in this case psychiatry.  So most likely about ten years, which can sound daunting, however, if this is what you really want to do it's totally worth it and while it doesn't sound like it, ten years will go by one way or the other, why not make the most of it and become a doctor that can help people?        Also, with that degree in the US I know you can do both: prescribe medicine and offer therapy.     Good luck!|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	Exactly.  Psychiatrists are in it for the money.  You get to be called doctor.  You don't have to go through 8 years of medical school.  And, it's an industry of quacks.|`|6MRcqskIaa	No way, the medical and mental health never mix their roles. They are two different departments. A psychiatrist does not look at causation of mental illness, like abuse. They only look at the chemical changes in the brain (medical) and will basically tell you to move forward and stop dwelling over your past, e.g. look for the future. To become a psychiatrist you must complete your doctors degree then complete a psychiatrist degree - you are looking at least 8 years of study    A psychologist is the only one that studies the brain both chemically and psychologically.  However they will send you to a psychiatrist to balance the chemicals out and whilst the client is on the medication  so they can treat the cause more effectively. Psychologist have several different levels. A basic psychologist is looking at 6 years, a clinical psychologist is looking at 8 years and a Doctrine  Psychologist is looking at 10 years.   Now what you want to become is totally up to you a medical doctor (psychiatrist) or a psychological doctor will depend on what yo have more interest in e.g. treat the problem medically or treat the problem psychologically. You cannot be both it would be classified as conflict of interest.
EMbaak9waa	It could be the pill that has played up with your cycle. If it continues see your doctor again and tell him about it.|`|7VfWz7zyaa	Dont worry, I was on the pill, and when i stopped taking it my periods were irregular. I don't think it's a problem.  If you're still woried see your Dr. :)|`|fnjDQleiaa	Its the pill.  It messed up your cycles.  I've had this problem too.|`|224cm8qtaa	the pill probably did funny things to your body. Have you talked to you doctor?|`|CG1Yd8yOaa	your cycle got messed up because of the pills. it will take time to regulate back out. no worries|`|Iar3b4vxaa	Birth control pills are funny. If your a virgin then you will be fine. Your hormones are probably a little messed up from the birth control pills. It was irresponcible of your doctor to put you on the because young girls have very irregular hormone patterns. It is best left alone. Wait about six months. If you haven't had a period go to a OB/GYN.     About the depression. I wouldn't start prescription drugs because there are a lot of issues when used on adolesence. Try going to a school counselor once a week. A lot of times stress causes depression. Just talking to someone wiser and who has resources can help.|`|JTI2Pmkaaa	yeah, it might be.. Read on the labels of your pills (if you haven't already done it) If you can't find anything then talk to your doctor. Your period is probably out because of some hormonal imbalance.|`|eUFTagY6aa	Please go back to the doctor and do whatever he says!  It is very important to follow his directions.

I wouldnt recommend applying anything right away if you dont know what the exact cause is, but for a dry nose you could try a saline solution. Mix of 1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized table salt and 1/8 teaspoon of baking soda (optional) per 1 cup (8 ounces) of water.|`|3VaaU2I4aa	pain, probably a boil/infection    use saline to keep it clean, put some triple antibiotic oinment on a q tip and put it on the lesion but it will take 3 days to clear up even so|`|jnG8sOzWaa	PICK IT
qMwjrQbOaa	Get a balanced diet and exercise consistently.|`|zijJOEXqaa	take her to a doctor|`|IQq0wNqQaa	Tell her parents. Tell her guidance counselor. Tell her she looks unhealthy, and she needs to eat something while she is with you. Tell her it's fine if she wants to eat healthy foods, but she needs to actually be eating.|`|8rMgQv15aa	Wow, first of all you need to get her some real help! if she is only 14 and purging herself like that, she has a real good chance of some long term negative effects. If she is getting to be a "bag of bones" as you say, and she still thinks she is fat then she definitely has an eating disorder. If I were you I would talk to a school counselor. if things get worse sit down with her parents while she's not around and let them know what you are seeing with her. She will probably get upset with you at first, but as her boyfriend, if you care enough about her you will know that no matter what she says to try to defend herself, she definitely has a problem and by helping her it will show her how much you really care in the end. Right now her mind is clouded with the idea that she looks fat for some reason. If you get her help she will eventually get over that, and realize how important it was that you got her help and she will love you even more for that.     I hope that helps!  Good Luck!|`|0eN5Y0Praa	Take her to a physician to make her feel ok with her size.If that's not convincing try downloading videos about the daily diet and routine of famous actress or models so that she'll atleast follow them.   And being under Diet without any doctors advice is a worst idea.|`|M8o5lh43aa	This reminds me of a Dr Phil episode a couple weeks ago about this teenage boy obsessed with diet and exercise. You should definitely tell her parents or your parents and get her some help. This is serious!    You should watch this video from Dr Phil about eating disorders: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5yqVXg32...|`|sdX023ZKaa	may be she should see a doctor i think she needs some councelling about her weight
AA12361841	your body cannot catch up sleep. u may feel more tired but there is no such thing. the average person should get 7-8 a nite, or go to a sleep clinic.|`|nyylb6qUaa	A body could get rest as normal on four hours. Your body needs to make up sleep if you continuously get only 2-3 hours of sleep a night, for at least 4-5 days. Sometimes I only sleep for four hours a night, and I never have to catch up on it. Good Luck, and may God Bless.|`|qXtyfxH7aa	You can't catch up on sleep, Just get an early night!|`|208549c0a73b82419e8bf972e6c47a97aa	no....just try and get the same amount of sleep each night and your body will adjust whether it be 5 hours or 12. Your body will adjust|`|J81bLTvsaa	I feel the exact way as well. Your body does nott catch up on sleep. For example, if I got 4 hours of sleep today, for the day after, I would only be able to get a maximum of 10 hours. Yes.. oversleeping can make you feel more tired and give you headaches. Being underslept is bad too (I have been only sleeping for 6 hours for weeks) because sleep is needed to help fight infection and keep the person's body active.
riFDDdscaa	You have high potassium from salt substitutes. Potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride.   Only 18% of the population shows any effects from sodium. 0% have ever lowered their BP by restricting sodium. I would say, an equal number, have been helped by artificially lowering BP    The point is, you should not be on a salt restricted diet. As long as you are not taking high dietary potassium or potassium sparing diuretics, you should never have to give potassium a second thought. Also, potassium test drawn at the doctors office and then sent out to a lab, will be inaccurate due to blood cell lysis from an old sample. This releases the potassium. At the hospital, the result will come back stating that the sample was lysised. Many times the result is high due to lysis but no warning. We treat the high potassium and the next thing we know, the patient is low.   Trust your body, you will live longer  Pharmacist who's life was almost ruined by Lipitor|`|37433c6ac47d0b92b72607c07f65afc1aa	How high is the potassium?  One thing is that potassium is WAY more dangerous than sodium when your balances are off.  The other thing is the sodium bicarb is not absorbed the same as Sodium Chloride which is what salt is.  So the sodium bicarb is not going to harm you that much but it's more important to get the potassium under control than the sodium.  Don't eat a lot of the Nu-Salt substitutes because this is potassium chloride.
5xxuKzXPaa	the funny thing is that i just had the same prescription, exactly. i had no side effects at all. i would call in and talk to a doctor about it. you could be experiencing true side effects but at the same time, it could be a coincidence.
D4GHgDl4aa	Perhaps it's stress. It can trigger a cold sore episode and give you all of the other symptoms you mentioned. be aware of what's happening in your life and maybe there's a clue there. Also avoid acidic foods and sun.
KeeaVzxpaa	It could just be friction from the bra or an allergy to something they are washed in. I have never heard of a bad condition that would affect both breasts, your underarms, and the back of your neck. A large percentage of women have cysts in their breasts so that is common. You may just be sensitive to the heat so try wearing something light whenever possible.|`|2hAuIg5baa	doctor|`|ZbMLigR3aa	It could be the material in the bra itself causing your reaction.  Sometimes when the skin gets overheated, it is more sensitive to irritants.  Try wearing cotton bras or changing your laundry detergent to see if that helps.  Cystic breasts are not supposed to burn.  Go see your family physician if the reaction continues, there may be a dermatologic issue behind all this.  Hope you find quick and easy resolution.  Good luck!
TKNPveHDaa	Food is only half the answer of losing weight.  You should try to continue eating the same, but ramp up your exercise.  Do more cardio, walk 2 more miles per day, and lift some light weights, that will keep you going.    Or, perhaps you are at your ideal weight?|`|erM2TCuWaa	push yourself even harder when you exercise is the only thing i can think of.|`|AA12182074	I totally was there a week ago.  What I did was I started eating less calories and working out harder.  I've lost 2.5lbs since I did that.  Congratulations on losing 35lbs!  Good luck with the rest of your healthy lifestyle, and don't get frustrated!  Just think how healthy you are when you're eating right and exercising.  Results will follow.|`|8rMgQv15aa	Create a whole new workout routine. I'm assuming you did most of the same workouts all the time with your regular diet? Don't change your eating habits because obviously they are working. Instead, intensify your workout routine a little and do some different workouts your body isn't used to. If you do a bunch of different workouts your body will be shocked into thinking it is being over worked again and will take the appropriate action (eg. burning more fat).     For example, if you jog a lot, try an eliptical machine. If you Bike a lot, try using a row machine. Just little things like that. There are lots of ways you can work out. Just look up some different ways so your body doesn't get used to your regular routine. It is best to change up the routine about every 3 weeks. This will keep your body from getting to used to one routine and you will continue losing weight as desired.    hope that helps!
WveXRwt4aa	I am not sure if you realize what 2-3 hundred calories actually consists of. That's like eating a bagel (gutted out) or a muffin with nothing on it and literally nothing else all day except for water, because as you should already know any sports drink or juice contains sugars, carbs, and or calories. At that point you would be dropping lbs at an alarming rate. I won't be the one to tell you not to do it, as you are your own person. So I will tell you that if you decide to go on this crash diet, I advise you take supplements of multivitamins, antioxidants, and maybe throw in there a protein shake with very low calories (read the labels they are usually high in calories) I say this so that you at least don't end up passing out during the day due to lack of nutrients.    One bad result is that, yes you will lose weight but once you start eating again you will gain it back and cheesy too because fat comes back lumpy! Good luck-|`|N9nJWYa5aa	Not a clue, how long does it take your body to decompose after you've induced a heart attack?|`|46c7cd50cfcdfc3b34f278651df37872aa	You would probably faint midway and be taken to a hospital.  If you ate any fat after that, your body would store it.  In all likelihood, you might lose a pound or two, but regain it and more once you started eating normally.|`|OBwqjS8maa	Probably a lot at first, but soon your body would go into starvation mode and hang on to any food you put in it for dear life. Sounds like a great way to become gravely ill.     You DO want to eat less to lose weight, but starving yourself does no good.|`|ltMbMIPlaa	glad you are not gonna do it. it depends on how much you weigh to begin with and what week of your diet it is. at the first week if you are about 100 to 200 pounds over weight you may lose 10 to 15 pounds. on the second week you may lose only a pound. but by then you should be going nuts or in a hospital :):)|`|IDrA6gMxaa	First of all it is very dangerous for your health.    How much would you lose? It depend on your current weight and how active you are during a day.

oVxr5B3Eaa	I don't have a preference other than non-scented, non-flavored.. nothing with any of that weird tingling lubricant or anything special like that, as it can all be irritating.. Look for PLAIN condoms... Maybe try some non-latex ones as well... My roommate SWEARS by trojan and lifestyles. Also make sure your properly lubricated. LUBE IS YOUR FRIEND! It's also fun. I use WET but I've heard great things about astroglide... It will really help take away the irritation of condoms, and there are many different ones to try.. just make sure it's water based and it won't even stain the sheets.     If that still irritates her she could try a diaphram (which doesn't have any hormones), or a copper IUD (again, no hormones) or spermicidal foam.     Go to something like the stag shop.. You can usually buy condoms individually and lube in tiny packs for $1 or 50 cents... buy a bunch of different ones and try them out to see what you like, and then you can go back and buy more of what you like in a bigger pack.     I think lube will really help you out though if your not already using it!|`|E9u93RVoaa	I use whatever kind your wife tells me to.
g10l9fKiaa	Figure out how much grams of protein he should be taking from his body size and how much he works out. Don't go less or above. You can check the label on the side. Actually those protein shakes are very good for you and are required if your looking to build muscle.    BTW you can't replace a protein shake with milk like posted above. Milk doesn't have enough protein and its not the best kind. Another point of taking protein shakes, is that it can be absorbed very fast.(You need it as fast as possible.) Milk is one of the slowest ways and by then it is useless.|`|ToztjpAsaa	I don't think it's safe for him to be drinking it at all, but that's just my opinion.|`|IDrA6gMxaa	He should not drink too much of eat. Just read the instructions on the box and try to control how much he drinks. And to be honest, water would be much better.|`|0R5gf3Abaa	it depends how heavy he is and he how much he exercises.  too much protein can strain the liver|`|2qPtGTNcaa	No. Not at all. By the way, some of those protein powders have soy in them and this causes a drop in sperm count to the point where men have become sterile.|`|49eSIGEcaa	Milk (preferably chocolate) contains just as much protein as those shakes. Plus, they're healthier. Make him drink milk.|`|ZZHFemQfaa	it is possible to consume too much but it depends on the body's needs. If you dont exercise regularly then you wont need a lot but if your a bodybuilder you'll need a truck load..literally|`|AA10894439	the shakes may or may not be harmful, not sure, but what's more worrying is the obsession with body beautiful
kvQW0VeGaa	It never hurt using tampons, was just kinda hard to get in until I figured out how to insert it right. At first it took me awhile...    A suggestion, I prefer playtex gentle glide tampons. If you are just starting using tampons try the smallest size at first. As you already found out if you are not flowing heavy enough it hurts to take them out. By using the smallest size and leaving it in longer (read the instructions) it will be more soaked when you remove it.    Once you get used to tampons, you will not go back to pads.    GL2U|`|fL3SiRDWaa	There is something called Toxic Shock Syndrome with using tampons.    They are not for everyone.  Don't put yourself in pain because you don't want to use a pad.  That might make your situation even worse.  On your lighter days, use panty liners, and on heavy days use the heavier type pads.    And I would suggest going to your doctor.  Hope it all works out for you.|`|Q7uzVqGtaa	the tampon was probably not in all of the way, that can be very painful, just relax and also the heavy and light tampons are marked so you know which ones are which and you should be able to tell if you are bleeding a lot or a little less or barely bleeding and you can choose tampons depending on how bad you are bleeding also they have boxes of mixed ones at the store and try putting a tiny bit of lube on it if you are too dry, it will go in you just need to relax when you do it|`|E9u93RVoaa	USE A ******* PAD|`|1OA8ZegTaa	You probably didn't have the tampon in all the way, which is probably why it hurt. If you are on your period, there should be enough fluid to get the tampon in without friction. You just need to relax and it will go in. It should be easy to come out only when it is full or close to being full. If you don't know your cycle to well, wearing a backup pantiliner is a good idea.

E64juLwJaa	Yes I always have ejaculated after a good ********  No problems.  Planets|`|Yb99bIdnaa	I don't think being circumcised has much to do with this, unless your erections are painful because the skin's too tight. In general, if you can reach orgasm during masturbation, your body's not the problem.    However, it's totally normal to have trouble reaching orgasm with a new partner, or even with an experienced one. There are a couple reasons:    First, you might simply be nervous. And the more you "try not to be nervous", the worse it gets! It's like trying not to giggle. The best way past this is to just play around with your partner, forget about orgasm as a goal and just explore each other's bodies for a while. Have fun, get comfortable, and you should find yourself more relaxed.    Second, your body is "used to" the sensations of masturbation, and it'll take some time to re-train your brain. Think of it this way: When you touch yourself, your brain gets two signals: One from your penis, because a hand is touching it. And one from your hand, because it's touching your penis. If both of those sensations are always present when you orgasm, you'll develop an association that they both need to be present in order to orgasm.    Breaking this association takes work. First, masturbate less. Second, offer to use your hand (or let your partner place their hands over your hand) during oral sex.     Third, frequent masturbation might have reduced your penile sensitivity. This happens regardless of your circumcision status, and it's pretty simple. Touching yourself less often will allow the nerves to regain some of their sensitivity. How MUCH they can regain DOES depend on whether you're circumcised or not, because the always-exposed glans is always subject to a certain amount of stimulation as you walk around during the day. You might try a Senslip, or look into foreskin restoration, to help regain some of this lost sensitivity.|`|abb886581ffcf2d8bf185b206f80f441aa	That is quite normal, dude...|`|AA11587429	That's actually pretty common regardless if the guy is circumcised or not.

mWBD1Mgyaa	Colds are horrible!!  It sounds like you could be suffering from some sinus pressure.  It can cause terrible headaches.  If you are noticing any green phlegm, I would suggest going to see a doctor.  This would usually indicate that you have a bacterial infection, and will need some antibiotics.  If you don't have any green phlegm, I would try some sinus medication...like Tylenol Cold and Sinus.  The Advil Sinus works really good too.  I prefer Ibuprofen over Tylenol...but each person is different.  Hope you feel better soon!|`|AcFBETxAaa	maybe a woodpecker or something is on your head. did you fall down and forget? who knows.|`|a9qxLXMlaa	Oh those are so the worst.Its a head cold to the best of my knowledge.Take some medicine for your symptoms and you should feel better until it passes.Of course it the syptoms dont go away in a week or so it could be a sinus infection,go see a doctor...Call ask a nurse...

He/she can remove the fibroid while maintaining your fertility.|`|Gojbv3Nraa	I was told I have over a dozen small ones that grow bigger when I get my period or am pregnant or am sick, and go down otherwise. I don't get it, but I do know that it didn't prevent me getting pregnant, nor did gaining weight. I gained A LOT of weight and am always in pain.  Apparently there are other factors involved in  whether a person can get pregnant when they have this condition.  I've had four children, despite two tubal ligations.|`|7MZBSys6aa	No. Especially among African American women--it's not rare at all.  Get it removed, by someone who doesn't think it's odd.  The surgery is simple.  They go through an incision in your belly button and your bikini area, snip it off, and the recovery pain, for me, was less than the fibroid pain.  Oh, and I was in my twenties!

The sufferer may or may not also suffer from excessive perspiration whilst awake.    Sleep hyperhidrosis may occur at any age, but is most commonly seen in early adulthood.    Night sweats may occur for genetic reasons and may be relatively harmless. However, they can be distressing and disrupt sleep patterns if severe; the patient may be frequently awakened due to the discomfort of damp sleepwear.    True night sweats with medical causes should be properly investigated by a physician.|`|z7cItuZTaa	only a professional can give you a real honest answer|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it could be your nerves.

VnLaUS3Jaa	the most effective way to lose weight and to keep it off is to get your body on a schedule... and to stop DIETING and to see that you must make a healthy LIFESTYLE change.    our bodies like stability.     eating less, but more often (5-6 MINI meals per day - - as a general rule, approx. 10 bites per sitting) is key to keeping your metabolism up, not fluctuating your caloric intake from day to day. choose foods from the food pyramid.    weight training followed by cardio REALLY boosts your metabolism.    i don't think any form of dieting is okay. think LIFESTYLE CHANGE. you'll be glad you did!!|`|b19c0b912d0e0621e553af51dc5aa5daaa	I think that would be alright. It's sounds like enough calories. When I was trying to loose weight I had to keep cutting calories until I seen a weight loss. That's what you  might have to do in the wrong run. They say that as long as you dont go under a 1000 a day your alright. I think the body can adjust to whatever you train it to.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	What you probably have is a urinary tract infection or irritation to the urethra, mouth of the bladder.  This is an infection that requires antibiotics to cure and if  you don't attend to it, could turn into a bladder or kidney infection, which can be life threatening.  Until you can see a doctor, warm baths sometimes relieve the pain and drinking cranberry juice (not sweetened) will sometimes help with protecting the bladder.  You really need to find and see a doctor.    best wishes..

5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	your anerobic corresponds to your vo2 max. you can increase this by doing high intensity work like sprinting.   start sprinting 100m, then increase it to 400 and then 1600m. sprint the whole distance, and try to finish the 1600m in 5-6 minutes. this does both to a degree.   aerobic is completely different, and running or jogging slowly for 5-10k will create slow twitch fibres and make you slower. try swimming to increase your aerobic fitness. a slow or medium rate is good, and you can try swimming on your back for long distances.   in the end you can only choose one. being able to sprint 100m in 10-16 seconds, or run for 10k-42k with no rest. (marathoners who can run 21k in 1hr, have very slow 100m times, and they can't accelerate, not even as fast as a normal person. )  if you want to run 10k in 30 minutes, try running 10k as fast as you can.   if you want to sprint very fast, and get up to a high speed fast, try 100m sprints.

Your mom has a drinking problem.  Nothing is going to get better until she addresses her drinking problems or you move out.    You will also find she will continue to be a pill to deal with because even though she drinks at night she is still classified as an alcoholic and she is a violent alcoholic.

However that does not necessary mean they are mentally unwell, unless your mother had also experience abuse during her life, abuse can cause people to have alcohol problems as well.   It is not much longer before you will get your life back. So do you think you could work with your mother for awhile, Just a suggestions because obviously you both have different parenting styles. Have you asked her why she feels you are neglecting the children (except the feeding the baby episode - obviously she was blind to this one).Just a suggestion, it might be something minor that you can temporary change whilst living under her roof.

Follow that with a 5-10 mile run and some lifting, you're good to go.|`|8rMgQv15aa	That looks like a pretty solid routine, but if you are looking to build muscle over time you definitely need to switch it up and add some weights. by switch it up I mean you need to do different workouts and not the same ones all the time. Your body will get used to your routine and stop responding. It will just be "going through the motions" with you after a certain point in time. make sure you add some weight about every other week and also about every 3 weeks switch up your whole routine. You will be very happy with the results.    Hope that helps!
5zTI9G3Taa	You don't say where the cartilage is but I am assuming you mean the top of your ear?    Firstly yes, always needles never guns. The cause of the scar tissue is most likely the gun rather than anything your hairdresser did to it. Guns can cause such huge messes with piercings and can put the back of the earing on to tight. In addition is it best to get a piercing done with a ball closure ring as it is easier to keep clean as you can turn the ring around.     Right, first off take the earing out now. Clean the area daily with either an antibacterial wipe or some salt water. Let the area heal. Give it some time, and i mean some real time, 6 months or so, to heal. After this go to a good piercing studio, not some shop in a mall that does piercings but a reliable piercing studio. Ask the piercer to take a look and give an opinion on whether it can be repierced. If it can't then do not try, go for another piercing if you really want or one on the other ear. If it can then get it done at the studio, with a needle, by a professional piercer. Follow ALL advice they give you about keeping it clean an healthy.     Good luck with it.|`|6QmDm8iwaa	well honestly Ive researched this don't re pierce it pierce another spot. this is why.........because when you pierce your ear the spot that was pierced had this bump which i call a seed but that is normal and will be there permanently and i know someone who pierced it again and it hurt so bad they had to remove it ASAP so that's my advice to you don't just relocate|`|4QSsJ23Caa	I would wait til it was either fully healed or fully closed.  I have no idea about cartilage piercing, but i have had my lip done 2x and eyebrow and under my lip..my lip has a lump too and scar tissue, i wanted to get it done again but dont thhink its a good idea, it will hurt alot more to pierce scar tissue, so i would suggest going near the last piercing not on the sam espot..hope this helps.

At birth, the neonate's vulva (and breasts) may be swollen or enlarged as a result of having been exposed, via the placenta, to her mother's increased levels of hormones. The clitoris is proportionally larger than it is likely to be later in life. Within a short period of time as these hormones wear off, the vulva will shrink in size.    From one year of age until the onset of puberty, the vulva does not undergo any change in appearance, other than growing in proportion with the rest of the body.|`|E64juLwJaa	No it does not stay the same.

VB76LCmSaa	bent arm pullovers with a barbell are for working the lower lats and the serratus.  it also helps widen the rib cage.  you could do barbell rows for your back also but it is more for your upper back.    Buon Fortuno!    Bruno Talina.|`|VnLaUS3Jaa	bent rows are a great addition to any workout. if you don't want to do one side at a time, you can do both at the same time with your barbell. just stand and bend at the waist. knees are bent. head is up, chest is out and back is straight (no rounding of the back!).    it's admirable that you are making sure to hit all three sections of the back. good mornings are a great way to hit that lower back. most people don't think about the lower back.    good for you!
qeN77EIxaa	When i first started using tampons, it hurt to insert them. A tip to help ease the pain, is to go for a wee before, then your abit wet down there, and its easier to insert the tampon. And when you are putting thre tampon in,don't aim in straight up, aim it towards your back bone, then curve it a little, make sure it is fully inserted, as far as you can get it up.    hope this helps :)|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	It's totally normal, and of course the tampon box says that because they wouldn't sell many if they were uncomfortable...okay well, they do, as many women use them despite discomfort because they dont realise there are better options available, often tolerating the discomfort or forgetting about it after a while using tampons. It's common to feel pain, particularly for the first time, if it does hurt then try again later and relax as forcing it will make things worse. If you can't use tampons it's no big deal as you can use menstrual cups, softcups or sponges instead which are healthier and easier to use than tampons anyway, or pads, even if you don't like them try different types may be much better than what you're used to.     Stabbing pain as you move is common at first, if a tampon isn't in far enough lower vaginal muscles push against it causing pain, so try again with a fresh tampon pushing as far up as you can towards the small of your back, and try non-applicators as you have more control. Stinging around vaginal opening is common due to damage from friction and dryness, help this by using lubrication like KY jelly also use organic tampons such as Cottons http://www.cottons.com.au or Natracare http://www.natracare.com Organic tampons are cotton so softer than synthetics in commercial brands like Tampax or OB so not as irritating or damaging, commercial brands also contain chemicals and bleach that you may be allergic to. Tampons can break or stretch your hymen so if in tact or partly broken this cause cause pain, just keep trying.     Always use the lowest absorbency as higher absorbency is not only have higher health risks but can cause more irritation and are larger in size so not as easy to insert at first, also remember to never use tampons when not menstruating or when flow is light. A great tip is to masturbate before inserting a tampon the first time as when aroused your vagina opens, doubles in size, relaxes, and lubricates is easier to insert.|`|gXne4VJcaa	For me tampons took alot of getting used to and yes they were very uncomfortable in the beginning. They key I've found to make it more comfortable is when I put one in I stand and put one foot up on like the bath tub and it seems to give it a better angle, and also angle the tampon slightly towards your back, just keep pusing it in because the further in it is the more comfortable I feel. (They can't go to far so don't be worried about that) I've also had the best with Tampax sports.  Good Luck!|`|AA10041941	dear you may want to try the teen kind... or the smaller ones at first! they aren't supposed to hurt! You need to just relax when your putting them in just breathe and relax..|`|SweWC8p1aa	OB?  never heard of it.. You should use Playtex Sport! Its amazing! And if your a first time user get some KY lubricant jelly stuff where condoms are sold.. Its not JUSt for condoms, when you are dry it helps get things like tampons up you without hurting you!!! |`|XSiuRFRVaa	the first time it feels weird try to push it up pretty far..... so u dont feel it :D|`|QSds2BOMaa	You don't have it far enough up|`|1lmSoo2daa	No it shouldn't, when it hurts it means  that you totally inserted the tampons wrong.|`|RdgSFkBLaa	Normally tampons do not hurt. If you are a virgin it is possible that it could be uncomfortable the first few time you use them, and you should buy a smaller size. If not, then no, they shouldnt hurt at all. I will recommend to you to try a brand with a plastic applicator because they are more comfortabel to put in and you are more likely to get them in the right place. I prefer the kotex brand, but I have also used platex. Tampax have a cardboard applicator and are okay, but sometimes (if dry) they are not comfortable to insert.   Anyway, if you try one of these, hold the applicator at the middle and insert the part above your fingers into your vagina, and you push it in with your forefinger until the part that was below your fingertip is flush with the middle.  Hope this helps although maybe tmi....

O9ymY67iaa	April 19 th last year I was a 40 a day man and had been for over 30 years, On April 20th last year I was a non smoker. How ? Champix tablets, I have'nt smoked since and my lungs are way better, my blood pressure has dropped to something nearing correct and all around I feel better. Some people will say these are too expensive, there not, they work they are a bargain. I was lucky I had no side effects and I know without them I would still be smoking   try it and good luck|`|8PEtIt1baa	The name of the drug used for smoking cessation is Chantix, and it has been shown to be more effective than other products currently on the market.  As a pharmacist, I've seen many people try this medication, some successful, some not.  I think the current rate of success is somewhere around 40%, which is significantly better than the patches or gum which are around 20-30%.  However, it all depends on your willingness and determination to quit smoking.      As for the side effects, the postmarketing surveillance of the medication has found that some people have experienced changes in their mood.  However, from my experience this is a pretty rare side effect.  The most common side effects of the medication are nausea, sleep disturbance, constipation, flatulence, and vomiting.    For the health benefits you'd have from stopping smoking, I think it would be worth it to try the medication, provided you are desiring to quit smoking.  Hope this helps.    Addition: Champix is the European version of Chantix.  Same drug, just different name.|`|6CEia23Naa	There is one called Champix.... I had them. They didn't cause me to feel angry but I didn't feel they helped me quit either. I ended up stopping them and just doing it on my own.    It may be the fact your cutting down on your nicotine which is causing you to feel angry, however if you feel the tablets are the reason for making you angry then they are probably not the right ones for you. Consult your G.P again to see if he/ she can prescribe and alternative.    Good Luck|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	it's CHANTIX, not champix.... and I had to stop taking it as it caused a severe depression in me... but I know that a great many people have used it to successfully stop smoking.  Each of us will react differently to any particular drug, I would not let it stop you from trying it if you want to, but certainly if you are the one feeling angry, talk to your doctor, it could simply be an anger response in you because deep inside you don't really want to quit.

It's perfectly normal and means you're having intense excitement.|`|224cm8qtaa	:) When you squirt if feel like you have to pee before hand. If it didn't smell like pee or look like pee then it probably wasn't pee. Did it feel good. Squirting typically feels really good afterward.

How did you feel afterward?|`|f48ec26299d8e35f27babe498de1ad01aa	I have been wondering about this "phenomenon" myself."  I have only experienced it one time with a Woman who had an O so strong that she squirted and pushed my P---S out at the same time!  So, I think that the fluid definitely comes from your sexual excitement, and because of its thicker consistency, it is not Pee.  You say that you hold back with your boyfriend, but, why don't you tell him about your urge to squirt?  I am pretty sure that he will be very excited to work with you on that, and will not mind the "mess"  Enjoy, and keep up the good work!|`|d5aa88d2dd913dea61404e5f13a231acaa	You may be one of the lucky females that can squirt during orgasm.

8rMgQv15aa	I actually had the same problem. I'm 24 and I still have trouble gaining weight. I work out all the time to gain muscle mass, but my natural metabolism is so high that it is hard for me to gain muscle mass. The solution to my problem was to take in about 6,000 calories a day, but to do that you would either have to eat very unhealthy foods or stuff yourself every time you eat healthy foods. That was getting way too expensive for me because I was eating about 5 huge meals a day which was costing me about $200 a week in groceries. I went to GNC to see if they had any solutions for me and they had a powder shake mix that has 2,000 calories a scoop and it was filled with vitamins and protein also. Perfect for weight gaining the healthy way. So instead of eating so much food and spending all that money at the grocery store I just buy a jug of Weight Gain powder at GNC about twice a month and I have seen phenomenal results. I have gained about 25lbs. of muscle since I started taking it. Just remember that when you are taking in that many calories it is essential that you keep a very vigorous workout routine, otherwise you are bound to put on a little chub.     Before I started taking the calorie supplement I was stuck at about 165 lbs. and spending way too much money on groceries with no results. When I got on the supplement it took me about 3 months to get up to around 190lbs. And with my workout routine it was all Muscle. I'm very happy with the results!    If you are looking for a great workout routine, I found a perfect program that did wonders for me.

Our son had been treated for Asthma for 4 and half yrs and we even had a nebuliser at home he was that bad - we moved area and of course new school.  Cutting long story short Head was a former staff nurse and told us to get to Dr that day as he could not walk across the classroom without having a coughing fit which sometimes resulted in him vomiting and we had to go collect him.      She wrote a letter of support for us to take explaining that she felt she could not longer accept him at school in this state.      He was given an immediate hospital appt and had all the blow test things and x-ray.  When we saw the x-ray I burst into tears as I thought it was a tumour on his lung.  2/3 of his lung has this mass.   Basically he was dealing with a collapsed lung.  Yet our previous surgery did not even pick it up - just kept saying he had chronic asthma.    He was put onto Kefalexin - FAB stuff but a nasty antibiotic.  Within 48hrs he was a different boy and by end of 1wk we just did not recognise him.  He had rosey cheeks, was starting to put weight on and had NEVER had a cough since.  He is best runner in sports now too.   We have thrown all the asthma pumps/meds out and given nebuliser back to hospital unit.    We kept saying to the Dr's this was not asthma as the drugs just didn't seem to alliviate the symptoms at all.  But once you are labelled as having asthmas other things are commonly overlooked.  He never had a nights unbroken sleep and neither did we.  WE DO NOW.

J9jAwJ6saa	When acid from the stomach H+ (HCl) enters the duodenum, cells lining the duodenum sense the acid and release the hormone secretin in the bloodstream. Secretin travels to the pancreas where it stimulates the release of bicarbonate ions (HCO3-) which enter the duodenum and neutralize the acid.     There are mucus secreting cells on the walls of the intestine which secrete mucus is order to protect the lining of the intestine from harmful substances during digestion.

MhpccWpmaa	It could have been bacterial vaginosis.  It's an infection that's more common than a yeast infection in women.  The main symptoms are a really strong fishy odor with your discharge which can be watery.  Sometimes these things can go away on their own.  If I were you I would go to the doctor and be checked just to make sure because sometimes you may also have no symptoms and still have it.  Only reason I say to be checked is because left untreated this infection can cause pelvic inflammatory disease|`|2zGKZB6gaa	Could you have been eating a lot of something out of the ordinary? I've heard that causes change in the way things smell and taste down there just like they say semen changes with what a man eats.|`|gs4fwiaqaa	I do not thin kit could have been the underwear. It was probably that you didn't cleanse properly. Continue cleansing properly, and be glad that it stopped. Hope I could help! [: |`|5d8c2bba509a543e4e26bca5c2c21e18aa	probably u had some fungal infection. i guess it was itching as well. many thngs can cause it but i dont think its up to ur pantys :)|`|ZUw8DBJVaa	Maybe it was both, maybe none, maybe one of the two. Also it could be hormonal or you could have a yeast infection - but if you had a yeast infection, it wouldn't have gone away without special treatment. The point is you SHOULD wear cotton underwear and you SHOULD cleanse properly everyday with water and every two days with a cleanser that your doctor will give you. Eat healthy and drink lots of water.|`|zMNgG9m0aa	sounds like a good old yeast infection and you are lucky it went away by itself!  good hygeine is important and I do prefer cotton undies, but you can also sleep without knickers on every now and then just to let things 'breathe".  yoghurt is a woman's best friend during those troubling times. if it happens again go to the chemist straight away, you can get great treatments now that are just one or two tablets, brilliant!|`|gVQZUmLfaa	you getting aroused maybe
pzLDXL6gaa	Had what put in? An IUD? Why are you on the pill as well, is that what your doctor recommended to stop the bleeding? If it doesn't work then ask for something else. I'm so confused by your question.    Harriet
JwnHKTabaa	Trust your doctor, because she ran tests on you.  Yeast infections don't go away immediately.|`|QIMBpEhwaa	they arent miracle pills, it'll take awhile for you to start noticing any differences.|`|2zGKZB6gaa	Not sure what BV is but I just treated my first (and hopefully only) ever yeast infection last week. I bought a Walgreens brand one dose treatment and used it Friday night. I still had yeasty discharge the next day but not nearly as much and by Sunday all the discharge was gone. I was still pretty itchy up until Tuesday though. I also took AZO pills 3 times a day and used some medicated wipes... So happy that's over with =) ... Hope you get similar results! Good Luck|`|3yo1c3nqaa	My best answer would be to just wait for a while and see if the diflucan will work. I am sure it does not go away in one day. If that does not work go back your doctor. Do not panic about the situation it will make matters worse.|`|hpvnCU8eaa	It's 2am in the morning, you must be in the usa or something, trust your doctor, you worry way to much, if your not happy with your doc's diagnosis get a second opinion from another doc, it will run it's course, with a bit of help from whatever your doc gives you and your body's natural defences it will run it's course and be over sooner or later, your doctor should no and would not be the first time he or she would of dealt with a situation like this so stop stressin it will pass.

5zxMTpLUaa	Sounds like you have got the flu or something, especially if your father and friends have it too, you very well could have caught it from any of them.     You should not go to school incase you spread it to more people.     Go to your doctor because you can get some antibiotics that should be able to help get you better quicker, in the mean time stay in bed, get lots of rest, take vitimin C tablets and drink plenty of water...    Hope you get better soon...|`|HDeUYCnXaa	You're just sick with the flu. heck, every1 is. just stay in bed, sleep, eat plenty of soup and drink plenty of water to get it out of your system. try seeing your doctor if you can for some antibiotics or medicine. annnnnd enjoy your short time off because you might have a lot of work to make up! *ahem* play video games, watch tv, go on computer, and sleep all day *ahem*. sorry. i've got a small cough ;]|`|JwnHKTabaa	You're sick; drink lots of juice and rest.  It's the best thing you can do.    (And yeah, you probably caught this from your dad and sister)|`|yEMRPW1Aaa	everyone is getting sick right now the flu is everywere and im sick my sisters were sick so yeah it should go away soon just stay in and get plenty of rest.
qMwjrQbOaa	Get a balanced diet and exercise consistently.|`|K1oOQqqVaa	There is only one way and it works.  YOU HAVE TO EXERCISE EVERY DAY.  Walk and walk and walk and when that gets easy then run or jog.  Then you will lose weight.|`|AA12182074	That is waaaaayyyy too low an amount of calories.  Your body is going to end up going into starvation mode and feeding off of your muscles.  Generally, depending on your hight, you should eat at least 1000 calories a day (I'm 5' and I eat 1200 a day).  Burning off 300 calories a day is a good idea.  I burn about 450 a day (I jog for 30 minutes which for me burns 300, and then I use the Gazelle machine thingy - it's like a stepping machine that glides - for 15 minutes and burn about 150 on that, and then I lift weights, but idk how much that burns).  Be sure to eat a balanced diet.  The best advice I have for you is to drink plenty of milk, lots of water, and avoid eating white foods (white bread, white pasta, flour, sugar, etc.).  Eat lots of fruits and lots of veggies.  Eat lean meats (turkey/fish) and beans and nuts for protein.  Try to follow the food pyramid (the new one, not the old one with the grains on the bottom).  I wish you the best of luck!|`|sdX023ZKaa	take 1000 cals a day and you could still lose weight in 3 months but dont starve your self you will do more harm i wouldnt|`|RTojCgVPaa	ok well honestly i have a better plan. eat 1,000 a day because you need the calories and as you go throughout the day you will burn it off also don't eat 1,000 of junk eat fruit and veggies and stay away from beef and chicken. however here is the best suggestion anyone possibly could ever give you. take up dance. i'm in it now and after just a few classes i've noticably lost a bit already. yeah it's tough but  besides helping you lose weight you gain flexibility and lean muscle which helps you burn fat while you are resting.|`|CcUf6M94aa	my friend was 15stone last year, she went on the cambridge diet which is basicallyyeatingn cabbage soup alot followed by other things, she lost hell of alot of weight and now she is a size 8. if this is any help havea lookk into this diet as i do belive it helps loose weight fast and not dangerous|`|HLmMKNScaa	Apart from the regular exercise that you need. Go for Herbal treatment. visit www.HerbalMedicate.com and suit your needs. Some of the people who have benefited from the same are some of my friends. You WILL be in a better shape very fast.
qMwjrQbOaa	My advice is:  Get a balanced diet and exercise consistently.  Try to be a vegetarian. It's good for health.|`|E3yOmel9aa	(I found this at ironmagazine.com. I did not write it, copied and pasted it)    Question:   How much muscle mass can I gain?       Answer:  Most gym rats expect to build LOTS of muscle really fast. This is a myth. You can NOT build muscle really FAST. The majority of readers, customers and clients I work with have completely unrealistic expectations when it comes to building muscle.     I can't put an exact number on how much you can gain but most people believe that they can build 20 pounds of muscle in three months...     ...it's amazing how many frusturated customers I get emailing me after their first month of training complaining that they only gained 5 or 10 pounds. I'm thinking to myself, "That's fantastic, what are you complaining about?!"     There is no doubt you can gain 20 pounds of WEIGHT in 3 months or even one month, but we are not talking about *weight* - we are talking about *DRY MUSCLE*     Pure muscle tissue. Not water weight. Not glycogen weight. Pure muscle weight!     There is not a chance in heaven that you will gain 5 or even 10 pounds of dry muscle in one month or even 3 months - not even close. I hate to be the messenger of this bad news but unless you are using growth enhancing drugs...     ... it's IMPOSSIBLE.     Many of you might be upset or discouraged about the TRUTH of how much you can actually build but this knowledge will help you to eat and train with a more realistic perspective. So how much muscle can your body actually manufacture?     Under the BEST possible circumstances (training, diet, supplementation, recovery) the average male body can create between *0.25 and 0.50* pounds of dry muscle tissue per week. That's the natural amount that your body chemistry will allow.     So your looking at 1-2 pounds of dry muscle each month. Not much? Well consider what your body will look like in 12 months from now with an extra 12-24 pounds of muscle?!?!     Starting to see the importance of consistency???!!!     You see, I did not gain 41 pounds of DRY MUSCLE in six months. The 41 pounds also factored in the increased muscle which was accompanied by increased glycogen and water storage in the muscles. More muscle equals more glycogen. Most people can maintain up to 40 grams of glycogen per 100g of muscle tissue.     So if you're gaining ten pounds of new muscle you'll consequently increase glycogen storage by around four pounds. So if you gain ten pounds of muscle, your scale gain will actually be closer to fourteen pounds (if you didn't gain any fat).     And rarely often will someone not gain any fat if you are gaining more than 3 pounds per month. So, when you set your goals, clarify in your mind if "20 pounds of muscle" is your *weight gain* goal or your *dry muscle* goal. And then put realistic time frames on these goals based on the info I just shared.     If you simply focus on keeping your body fat between 10-13% fat while gaining around 5 pounds per month then it is safe to say you are gaining 1-2 pounds of dry muscle a month with 1-2 pounds of glycogen and water hopefully no more then a pound of fat.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Basically, you get what you pay for. The cheaper they are, the more rubbish is in them. Anything from sawdust to newspaper to bulkers and fillers. Learn to read between the lines of what the labels tell you. For instance: 'plant extract' can simply mean a weed.|`|AA11017714	Trying to stay thin and lean...  You mean effeminate but with that gym-rat look?    Are you a Will Truman kinda guy, I take it?    lolz|`|JoAfcy4Caa	Balanced diet is best for you|`|AFkjkqcSaa	I do a lot of training, boxing etc. Although I amof athletic build I dring a protein shake after ny session, only once a day!! I only drink one however as I eat alot of protein and have a good healthy diet. I do know that those body builders take uo to 3 a day, but thats only if ya wana be a beast.  Protein helps with muscle recovery and helps to define muscle.
kC8JHWVQaa	Join the crowd honey seems like this is a huge problem for older women now days never was before but Ladies in the early stages of menopause or going threw this is causing many women to have acne like a teen again,,,And you are right I have seen many women who look like they are teens again and are in disbelief such as you and why because the hormones in the body are changing  by hypersensitivity to androgen's (male hormones). But an imbalance in both male and female hormones (estrogen) can also cause break outs as well.This happens with pregnancy's,premenopase, & menopause some medications if taken any cosmetics if use any will cause the break outs as well.Antibiotic"s can be taken to clear this up have to seek out a dermatologist Been there done this and still goes on. Are we teens again???|`|MX3wOs1vaa	This is all perfectly normal.  Adult acne has been increasing over the years.  This is all due to fluctuations in hormones.  Have you gone through menopause yet?  This can be as a result of this to.  Not only will some women suffer from adult acne, but when menopause comes knocking on our doors, we will start to see all the pigmentation problems exposed (as a result of the sun from years ago and many other radicals).|`|RuMlEnKXaa	My best guess is a change in either diet or any beauty products you are using.    Try and think of anything that my have changed in the last month or so.    Also stress can bring on changes to your complection.
6MRcqskIaa	You are able to dispute the diagnoses under the mental health act. Especially under the grounds that you were under aged at the time. No mental health team would in the rightful mind actually diagnose a minor unless it is learning difficulty disorder. However, you say you were diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder who did this diagnosis. If it was your local general practioner then it will not stand. It would have to be made by a psychiatrist. If if was done by your local GP then you can obtain a second opionion, which can overall this diagnosis. If it was done by a psychiatrist dispute the diagnoses under the mental health act in your state.|`|DMpVSHvXaa	Find a psychiatrist.    Gather evidence that shows that you are not bipolar.    Get them to state in writing that it was a misdiagnosis.|`|hZjPYyFTaa	Get another doctor to vet you. A second opinion should be acceptable. Everyone is pseudo bi-polar at 12. In fact many sloppy doctors will stick people with that diagnosis at any age. I was given that diagnosis just because I felt manic a few days on top of my depression.   Doctors misdiagnose people all the time - it goes with the territory. So see a psychiatrist and get that second opinion.  I know nothing about armies.|`|6SB4ufEYaa	Go and talk to a psychiatrist.     They're the ones that diagnosed you. They're the ones that may be able to undiagnose you.|`|AA10231844	I would see a psychiatrist for a second opinion.  Are you on medication?    Dana (M.S.

kC8JHWVQaa	Would say about as good as the rest that claim to kill the pests and don't just stunts them enough to catch with the combs that are used to tear the hair from your head a sure fire way to remove the nits eggs and parents remove the entire hair that is always the best way to cure head lice...  A human parasitic insect that lives on human"s heads (scalp). And lay eggs in (on )hair . Live about 23-30 days, Female lays eggs many at that 150+ a month eggs hatch in about 12 days be full adults in 2 so the cycle continues again till treatments is dome other wise you become infested and full blown at that and have a mess to deal with.  These bugs feed on the blood of humans from the head every 3-6 hrs,but can survive without for 4-6 hrs some have made it as long as 2-4 days (reports have been made) off a host.  They like warmth about 82 degrees,Humidity around 70 % this is why they are more common in the South  and summer month's and when school begins since school starts in mid summer. In warmer states the lice problem is all year long  People deal with this issue all YEAR I found a great product that REALLY works Its call LICE KILL WORKS GREAT !!! Have used for kids and have a repellent that is wonderful!!!|`|MojYmo5Jaa	The best way is using conditioner and a nit comb. You do this every 3 days until all the nits have hatched into lice. You get them because some people are too lazy to check their kids hair or even do their treatment. They are prevalent all year round.|`|AA12266052	There is anecdotal evidence of neem's effectiveness in treating infestations of head lice in humans.|`|AHY3UUIiaa	I sure its prevalent at all times of the year. They go for clean hair and it keeps then warm and living. Your more likely to have a hat on your head at winter time so that will keep them warm just like in the summer.    AJ.X|`|Rt4K0Qy8aa	The most effective thing I've found to prevent head lice is to use T-tree shampoo and conditioner.  There's something about it that repells head lice.  My daughter used to keep coming home from school with lice time and time again, but we've been using the T-tree for a few years now, and she's never had them since.
AA12182074	I was unaware there were any harmful effects of meditation...|`|y07MGbLcaa	possible fatality|`|K1oOQqqVaa	None.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	About the only one I can think of is if you try to 'develop' too much, too fast.

qi6a30eIaa	It isn't per se good for your health, but it isn't bad either. It can become a problem only if you over do it to an extent that it is affecting your other areas of life such as Studies or Social functions.
5843355184faeff731f1a94bbecb55e4aa	Not so much...if someone has a functional limitation (such as back pain interfering with daily activities) and if there are high stressors, we might include progressive relaxation techniques...otherwise, this is largely handled by psychology.
AA10339824	much higher risk.   it's alarming, actually.   you can search that exact question and get thousands upon thousands of studies that would verify it.|`|ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	Yes. That's why there is a warning label on the pack. It's a proven fact|`|XoOanmdraa	no its not proven...its just a media hype between different companies|`|IBbD7C8Paa	i wish it wasn't
qMwjrQbOaa	Check with your doctor. May be a matter of calcium.|`|R0RaP5wZaa	drink more|`|8rMgQv15aa	I have a friend that is like that. She doesn't sweat for some reason on her head or face or arms. It's some kind of condition or something. Anyway, what she did when she played basketball was obviously drink more water, but she also had a little water bottle with a mister on it sitting on the bench at all times. During quick breaks she would just spray a little water on her face and arms so the water keeps her body cool while she works some more. It's a simple solution really. And don't worry. Just because you don't sweat much is not a bad thing. just make sure your skin doesn't start getting really dry.    hope that helps!|`|owjDBCc7aa	drink lots of water and you will sweat.|`|y07MGbLcaa	you are not working hard enough, you get tired but you are out of shape, if you were in shape you would not get tired as easily and you would sweat alot more|`|AA12182074	Definitely drink more water, and if you're still concerned ask your doctor.|`|RLJJGZJnaa	Yeah, all you need to do is drink a lot more, and then you'll be right and you will sweat more :)
ISPIa0n5aa	You were freezing b/c you had a fever.  You were already sick.  Some people think you get hot if you have a fever, but it's the other way around.

Well i think you should go to the doctor.|`|XvovBRlnaa	only after prolonged exposure|`|IE9NfLGoaa	either that or you caught it somewhere else and it made you feel like you were freezing|`|bwyBXDMHaa	No sounds like that was just the first stages of your Flu! it sounds like you have the flu anyways..hope you feel better!|`|wEbB1FuNaa	No you cant get sick from being cold. The cold actually kills germs so you probably got sick from your little brothers room or something like that.|`|d5aa461bdb5fa1bfd8158df539805abeaa	Sounds like the flu  it comes on really quick like that.  It's not from being cold though.  You were just feeling cold because you were getting sick.|`|CG1Yd8yOaa	no you had a fever the whole time. when you have a fever you feel like you are cold because compared to your body temperature the air outside your body is cooler.    and no, you cannot get sick from being cold, not even from goin outside without a coat on. you have to be exposed to a bacteria or a virus to get sick|`|AA11321694	malaria or viral infection.|`|5xIxQ5yfaa	where do u live?    ur symptoms are signs of malaria ---> a virus infected by mosquitoes  normally when u get marlaria ur body shivers like hell and than feaver, than aches all around ur body.............    go to da doc if ur feaver is gettting worse|`|OYq99U4Yaa	24 hour flu?? i would say its the 24 hour flu.|`|dj8ofPtgaa	Well as soon as I began to read your message I knew had a fever. And as confident as I am you confirmed it. When you have a fever you always feel unremarkably cold and freezing, just the opposite of what you would think. A fever is your bodys way of removing the bad guys from your body. You had the cold first. Believe it or not you should remove the blankets and sleep with sheets and take a cold bath Its sucks but thats how you can reduce a fever without medicine.
zFsTSrOcaa	Are you sure that's what he said?  Menopause at age 15 would indicate a very serious medical problem, and your doctor should have referred you for further diagnostic tests.|`|fL3SiRDWaa	Ummmm I hope not, I thought ladies around 50 go through menopause.  Are you sure he didn't mean you started your period? (PMS)|`|MhpccWpmaa	You must have heard wrong, you can't be going through menopause at 15.  Menopause is the change of life that happens in your 40's-50's when a woman stops getting her period.

j0JTUiTaaa	You have a full panel of blood tests done to check all your levels like for any surgery.  They also need a baseline for your follow up blood tests.  They are also at some hospitals monitoring Vitamin D levels pre and post bariatric surgery.  I am one of those being monitored.      I would not worry about the pot, but I would also discontinue the use of it.  You should stop smoking anything for 6 weeks prior to the surgery, especially if it is going to be open and not laprascopic.|`|bCmqScVlaa	It's just routine bloodwork for a complete blood count.  I won't go into listing them all.  No, they won't know if you smoked weed.  They don't check for THC.
tkDfqjQdaa	Gonorrhea is a bacteria that grows in warm moist places like the entire reproductive tract in women, the urethra in men and women, the mouth, throat, anus and eyes.  This bacteria is transmitted through close contact of these areas with an infected person.  There are serious complications that can arise from this STD and it should always be treated by a medical doctor and all recent partners should be notified and treated.  For more information  http://www.cdc.gov/std/gonorrhea/stdfact...|`|a1ymHaWAaa	doctor has to prescribe some sort of medicine to cure this S.T.D. you get it through unprotected sex or unprotected oral sex.|`|OyBuEpOTaa	It is sexually transmitted.

Your sex partners must get treatment at the same time.  80% of women do not have symptoms but the disease can be devastating for them.   Do not try to treat this infection by your self with herbal or homeopathic remedies because they will not work.  The symptoms may go away but the infection is still there which means you will still be infectious to your sexual partners.

Hope yu get better :D|`|OZvsw3KGaa	cold things or warm thing !! well i used to warm up orange juice! it sounds odd but it helped lol !! emm dont cough if you can help it! but strepsals and warm NOT HOT warm juice or any drink help|`|0eb5efa701843dadf3c5e74ac84a930baa	You need antibiotics....strep throat is related to scarlet fever , which if left untreated can damage the heart.|`|UsNgFI7haa	you can eat what you want if you can take the pain i would say eat stuff like jello ice cream apple suace anything smooth soft and soothing|`|9Bywhynmaa	I have had strep throat a few times. I believe that you be careful. You know if it hurts to swallow, then don't. Try liguids, jello and thing like that. Milk products are not good because they will cause you to cough, which will irratate your throat more. Throat drops like vitamin c drops are good.

In fact, they may even be unaware that they need emergency treatment. Someone with hypothermia also is likely to have frostbite.  The symptoms include:      * Drowsiness      * Weakness and loss of coordination      * Pale and cold skin      * Confusion      * Uncontrollable shivering (although at extremely low body temperatures, shivering may stop)      * Slowed breathing or heart rate  Lethargy, cardiac arrest, shock, and coma can set in without prompt treatment. Hypothermia can be fatal.|`|42dafba9ff7361d27a14115d9d33feedaa	What are the symptoms?  Hypothermia is classified as a temperature below 35C (96F).     Watch out for the 'umbles': stumbles, mumbles, fumbles and grumbles. These are symptoms that show a gradual reduction in coordination of muscles and movement, and a falling level of consciousness.    Symptoms progress as the person's temperature drops:     Initially, involuntary shivering, loss of complex motor skills (but still able to walk and talk), shutdown of blood vessels in the hands and feet.  As temperature falls below 35C (95F), violent shivering, impaired consciousness, loss of fine-motor coordination, especially in the hands, slurred speech, illogical behaviour, loss of emotional cognition - an 'I don't care' attitude.  As core temperature falls below 34C (92F), the effects becomes life threatening, shivering become intermittent and then stops, the person curls into the foetal position, muscles become rigid, pupils dilate, pulse rate drops.  By 30C (86F) the person looks dead. Although still alive, they're in a state known as the 'metabolic icebox', breathing becomes shallow and erratic, consciousness is lost and the heart becomes vulnerable to deadly arrhythmias.       Shivering is one of several symptoms that can be used to assess hypothermia. If the person is able to stop themselves shivering, their hypothermia is only mild. If it can't be stopped voluntarily, the person has moderate to severe hypothermia.     Another quick test is to assess higher brain functioning by asking the person to count backwards from 100 in multiples of nine. This sort of cerebral ability is soon lost as temperature falls.     A sign of severe hypothermia is loss of the pulse at the wrist, a result of the circulation shutting down.|`|gNr93uqSaa	Hypothermia usually occurs gradually. Often, people aren't aware that they need help, much less medical attention. Common signs to look for are shivering, which is your body's attempt to generate heat through muscle activity, and the "-umbles":        * Stumbles      * Mumbles      * Fumbles      * Grumbles    These behaviors may be a result of changes in consciousness and motor coordination caused by hypothermia. Other hypothermia symptoms may include:        * Slurred speech      * Abnormally slow rate of breathing      * Cold, pale skin      * Fatigue, lethargy or apathy|`|AA11321694	Hypothermia occurs when the body gets cold and loses heat faster than the body can make it. Temperature below 35C (96F) is known as hypothermia.     Early symptoms include:        - Shivering.      - Cold, pale, or blue-gray skin.      - Lack of interest or concern (apathy).      - Poor judgment.      - Mild unsteadiness in balance or walking.      - Slurred speech.      - Numb hands and fingers and difficulty performing tasks.    Late symptoms include:      - The trunk of the body is cold to the touch.      - Muscles become stiff.      - Slow pulse.      - Breathing that is shallow and slower.      - Weakness or sleepiness.      - Confusion.      - Loss of consciousness.      - Shivering, which may stop if body temperature drops below 90F.    Hypothermia is an emergency condition and can quickly lead to unconsciousness and death if heat loss continues. It is very important to know the symptoms of hypothermia and get treatment quickly. If someone begins to shiver violently, stumble, or can't respond to questions, suspect hypothermia and warm him or her quickly.
E32VRp8caa	If you were diagnosed years ago with ADHD, you still have it.  Most children do not grow out of it.  They take it into adulthood.      ADHD is a very common disease that you can pass on to your children.  (Genetics)    Find a good pediatric Psych. for your child and a good Psych for you to get rechecked.      Some of the symptoms you  are describing may be some form of bipolar.  Bipolar and ADHD have many overlapping symptoms.      Go the the doctor and get diagnosed.  Take your son to the doc as well.|`|EZt7ZHIiaa	To me it sounds like you are more stubborn and/or careless with certain things rather than exhibiting symptoms of ADHD.  It is very possible that you do have adult ADHD since you had it as a child, however based on your examples I wouldn't necessarily draw that conclusion.  If you would like to discuss it further, I am a professional therapist and also conduct sessions online.  Feel free to check out the link on my profile or send me an email if you are interested.    Ryan|`|GBG2hbQ4aa	ADHD does not go away.  The symptoms can be more or less severe depending on many aspects of your life. Stress level and diet both have a profound impact on psychological states.    I know there are many who support the idea of ADHD being hereditary, that genetics play a big role.  I would challlenge that one.  Within a family grouping, everyone has roughly the same dietary habits, and so would have many of the same health problems (ones that are related to diet).  Diet plays such a huge role in both physical and mental health.  If you wonder how diet can have a role in mental health....remember your brain is part of your physical self.  So the physiological health of the brain is critical to what psychological (and behavioral) dynamics are presented.    All that said, you might want to explore diet.  The Feingold Diet has had some success in reducing ADHD symptoms (both behavioral and cognitive symptoms).  You can find information on that diet by doing an online search.  Just a brief summary....Dr. Feingold developed this diet back in the 1960s as a treatment for some of his allergy patients.  One of the (happy) side effects of the diet was a marked reduction in ADD and ADHD symptoms in his patients (that had ADD/ADHD as well as allergies) after they had been on the diet for a while.  The diet is now used as a treatment option for ADD/ADHD.      The diet is more complicated than this, though this is a good generalization.  Avoid all processed foods (junk foods and fast foods).  They contain many artificial components that are neurotoxic (meaning toxic to the nervous system, the brain is part of the nervous system).   The original diet allowed sugar, but I believe sugar should be eliminated from the diet of anyone who exhibits ADD/ADHD or any other neurological symptoms.  Sugar burns up many important nutrients... minerals and B vitamins among them.  Several minerals are critical for the health of the nervous system, as are most of the B vitamins.    That leaves you with what is called a whole food diet.  Vegetables, fruits, whole grains, protein from healthy sources.  That amounts to eating the way people ate prior to the creation of all the man-made (artificial) ingredients.      Dr. Feingold also directed his patients to minimize environmental exposures to chemicals.  Environmental hazards to health are becoming more and more profound. Luckily there is more awareness and lots you can do to create a healthy home environment.  (Check out Debra Lynn Dadd's book  "Home Safe Home").|`|hZjPYyFTaa	ADHD is a permanent disorder. It may get worse during times of stress.   The only way to tell if the diagnosis was correct is to get psychological testing.   I would recommend it for your son, so he won't fall behind in school.   I found out to late, it played havoc on my academic performance and if it was known then another education technique would of helped. There are 6 different ways people learn. The public school system offers 2.|`|uLp9FDSnaa	My opinion is no, you dont still have it.  What the mind wants to believe then the body will do, remember the mind is a important tool. If you tel yourself you dont have it and fight these urges then you will see you can overcome anything you put your mind to.   I think you feel your misunderstood or your seeking something thats not there and that makes you react this way. I wish i can do something to help you, but i advise to see a professional at least once and see what they have to say about this.  Gudluck|`|HPpdcAtAaa	You could still have it.    According to the The National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke:     "There are several types of ADHD: a predominantly inattentive subtype, a predominantly hyperactive-impulsive subtype, and a combined subtype. ADHD is usually diagnosed in childhood, although the condition can continue into the adult years."    http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/adhd/...     Also, this site has great resources for sites on ADHD:    http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides.to...

Unfortunately my daughter exhibits the same signs, but the drugs are not an option as far as I am concerned. I got her into Martial Arts to try and help her learn to focus better. As for me, I am back in school, my house is a mess and I am so overwhelmed I feel paralyzed. Don't wait for things to get like this for you. Try to find help like biofeedback and other holistic approaches. I have read several books about ADHD and I don't think it is a disorder, but just a different way of being. We can excel at certain things that the so called normal people can not. Do as much research as possible by credible sources and definitely not here at YA. You may get a couple good answers, but some people also love to be judgmental and try to make you feel like crap when they have no idea what they are talking about. Good luck!|`|xgvPCQXsaa	Yea it do cause my husband do the samething.    And it hard on me to deal with all the time.
pISC6pphaa	I was on Depo for a couple years.  It was too strong for me.  I gained weight, my hair fell out, I was constantly sad, angry, mood swings, severe depression, and I felt suicidal.  I didn't understand at first that the emotional things were a side effect.  I thought they were real feelings, and I couldn't understand why I had turned into such a horrible person.  I also bled a lot, on periods, and between. I had trouble getting pregnant afterwards, and when I finally did, it was an ectopic (not necessarily caused by depo). I have always had a problem with facial/neck hair (it runs in my family) and I had even worse facial/body hair problems on depo.    Even after getting off depo, I had the chemical still in my body.  My periods were completely screwed up, I had terrible emotional stuff.  It eventually cleared up to where the emotional stuff was only around my period.  I knew then I would get depressed, think about suicide.    All those side effects are caused by the estrogen.  Depo is high dosage b/c it has to last for 3 months.  there are lots of alternatives with lower doses.    Depo was a horrible experience for me.  I'm on Yasmin now (pill) and things are much better.  I had a little similar experience for the first couple months, plus headaches and diarhhea.  But not as strong, and it cleared up after those months.  I now feel pretty normal.    I know a lot of women who had similar problems with Depo. It's not for everyone.  If you want to get pregnant later, it can cut your fertility for 5 years or more.  You have to decide if the risk is worth the benefits of not having to worry about it for 3 months.    If you do go on Depo, make sure you report any side effects - especially weird bleeding or suicidal feelings to your doctor, and get changed to something else if necessary.  I never hurt myself, but I came awfully close a few times, and it's scary.  No one should go through that.    I'm usually terrible about remembering things, and I was scared about going on the pill, but I've actually done very well with that part.  I'm older, and more mature than I was years ago when I took depo because I was afraid of forgetting.  You make it a routine, with your morning coffee, or brushing your teeth, and it becomes part of your life.

There are plenty of healthy foods.  What I do, instead of telling myself what I can eat, and keeping the list small, I just think about what I won't eat.  If I'm going to the cafeteria at college, I won't eat the pizza, fries, or ice cream.  That leaves many other options, like soup, small sandwiches, vegetables and fruits, omelets, meat, whatever is available.  Just cut the fast food and eat what's healthy, but what you'll enjoy.  Believe me, you won't stick to a diet if you're feeling hungry and unhappy with your food all the time.  And this should be a lifestyle, long-term change, not just a couple weeks.|`|2kQoqpBtaa	just exercise daily.that's it?|`|EMbaak9waa	Have you tried raw vegies? What about Salads?

oVxr5B3Eaa	I moved out at 18. We lived in a small town and there was no where to rent there.. and since I wanted to finish out school at the same place, I stayed until I was done high school. I moved to a city 1.5 hours away about a month after I graduated. It's not as expensive as your think. It's great to live with your friends and have  people over whenever you want and go wherever you want whenever you want and eat what you want and if you don't feel like cooking.. well, you can eat later. You can have sleepovers and you don't have to tell anyone and you can have people sleep in your bed.     I love living alone (well, with a friend) but I know other people that are constantly homesick and travel home every weekend... I only go to my parent's 3-4 times a year even though we live so close.     As long as you have enough cash to back it up and a job, go for it.. i love living by myself!  But be warned.. depending on the cost of housing.. your looking at about 1200 a month MINIMUM... That's for food,, rent (400)... billls, cell phone, transportation... and you have to pay first and last month so make sure you have at least a few thousand saved up :)    Good luck!|`|2hAuIg5baa	yep yep|`|E9u93RVoaa	me too. parents r homo. marry me?|`|BCeeAGHdaa	I feel good.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	If you are financially set, it will be easier to do than if you have no money at all.

You probably just need some anti-biotics to clear it out!
QLthbgULaa	I also suffered with acne through all of my adolescent years.    I started on Accutane days before my 20th birthday. Due to the risk of severe birth defects in pregnancy, there is a lot of administrative red tape to clear before you can go on the medication. Don't be surprised if it takes a couple months of dermatology visits before you are actually able to receive the prescription.    As for the side effects...I had the standard dryness: dry skin, dry lips, dry nose, dry hair, dry eyes sometimes, dry throat. This was all pretty easy to control. I used St. Ives 24 Hour Moisture lotion for my body, an oil free moisturizer for my face, Aquaphor for my lips (and I applied some to the inside of my nose with a q-tip...kind of gross, but it really worked), eye drops and I increased the amount of water I drank.    I did NOT have symptoms of depression. If anything, as my skin began to clear, I noticed an extreme increase in my self confidence. I think a lot of people who experience depression while on Accutane may already be uncomfortable about their skin and do not psychologically respond well to the initial breakouts.     The serious side effect I experienced was a 60+ point jump in my cholesterol after the first month. I went low fat, low cholesterol for the remainder of my treatment and was able to get it below where it started. It was pretty sucky to change my eating habits, but I was proud of my ability to stick with my diet, pleased that I could stay on the medication, and I think the long-term effect on my eating habits is better because of it.    I have been off Accutane for 15 months, and I have to say my acne is not as great as I would like. That being said, compared to what it was, my skin is utterly remarkable. I am so please with my skin. I have become so self confident and really grown as a person in the past year, and I do think Accutane played a role in that. The acne I do get is much more manageable, primarily just monthly "breakouts" (a few scattered pimples) that can be treated with over-the-counter products. My hair used to be overly greasy and since Accutane it has improved considerably (not one of the prescribed uses of the drug, but definitely a plus for me!). To my knowledge, I do not have any long-term health effects from my cholesterol scare...thanks to their vigilant monitoring.    The bottom line, even with my cholesterol issue and dietary changes, I would repeat my Accutane experience again in a heartbeat.     Good luck with whatever you decide to do. :]|`|8EsicBxUaa	I am currently using Dianette for mine, i am sure you will have already had this, i have only used it for 2 months, it is making a slight improvement...     Have a look around this website.  There are loads of others on here that have used accutane too  www.acne.org|`|AA12361568	I took accutane when I was 16 years old (23 now). I had cystic acne also, and being in high school with it was a horrible experience. I believe the treatment lasted 6 months? When you first start taking it you break out even worse, but that doesn't last long, if I remember correctly. I did not get any side affects while I was on accutane, however if you accidentally become pregnant while you are on it, it can cause serious birth defects to the baby.     The accutane FULLY got rid of my cystic acne. Though around my time of the month I will still break out with a few pimples here and there, but NOTHING compared to what it was like before. Now I'm just waiting until I can afford a laser peal on my face to get rid of all the scarring I have. =(    Good luck and I hope accutane works for you as good as it did me!
8rMgQv15aa	It's definitely not a big problem. It's just because you got out of shape. Yoga works your muscles and gets your blood flowing but it doesnt really get your heart working like it would if you were straining yourself in exercise. So, stick with the gym exercising for a while and in about 2 or 3 weeks you will notice a big change in how hard your heart has to work. The "heaviness" will dwindle if you keep at it.    hope that helps!|`|jhdpLhNcaa	If you have quited gym for a while it's normal not to be in the same position.|`|RvPuRmqAaa	That fact that you've come here to find help about your obvious heart discomfort (although it may be nothing) is reason to get a check up with your doctor.     One of the symptoms of angina is a feeling of "heart heaviness". More info here http://www.emedicinehealth.com/angina_pe...    Please do yourself a favor and make an appointment with your doctor or go to a medical aid unit. Better safe than sorry. Even if you find a real doctor on here to give you advice, it's not the same as seeing one personally and being evaluated.    Get medical clearance so you are free to workout worry free. I am not a doctor but I would never feel comfortable telling someone with heart discomfort that "it's OK".
oVxr5B3Eaa	The pill works by basically tricking your body into thinking it's pregnant... Because when your pregnant, you don't ovulate! The first month you might get a LOT of pregnancy symptoms... mild cramping, nausea, soreness,,, your boobs will likely get bigger.. I know I was sore ALLL over.... Then you'll get normal PMS symptoms and then your period. The next cycle it won't last so long... maybe a week.. After that, you'll drop down a couple days each month until you only feel like that for a couple hours after the first pill in each pack....Going from no hormones for 7 days to a JOLT of hormones does make you feel a little weird, but soon it will wear off VERY quickly as your body gets used to it.   If you've ever taken Plan B, you'll know what I mean. Plan B is basically just a shock of hormones... It makes you tired, makes you nauseous... The whole deal.       I wouldn't worry too much about blood clots. The first sign if your going to get them is usually headaches and migraines.. A few extra headaches are normal on the pill, but if your getting a ton of migraines you might have a problem.      If your really worried, talk to your doctor, but I really think you are fine!    Good luck!|`|ZbMLigR3aa	This is definitely not a normal reaction.  Please go back to the doctor who prescribed the pills for you or get to the emergency room now.  The aching is a sign that you are having a bad reaction to the pills.  You need immediate medical attention when this happens hon.   I hope you feel better soon... Good luck!

Using herbal remedies that will no doubt not work, can make a minor problem more serious. A warm bath using mild soap should be sufficient for cleanliness but will not reach the uterus. The uterine lining sheds and renews itself every month.|`|0eb5efa701843dadf3c5e74ac84a930baa	A uterus doesnt usually need cleaning unless, there are polyps that has to be removed by a surgeon or unless there is post pregnancy material.

3v59cDWfaa	Pain is felt by what we can put into perspective of a switch. PainKillers turn these switches off in the body. Or pain can be viewed as open ports, hoses with the pain representing a liquid flowing through them. A pain killer is an artificial means of putting these these blockers, switches into your body. Your body produces endorphins that are very similiar to morphine which natural block your every day pain. These all release dopamine which makes you happy (Cocaine floods your body with dopamine) , as levels of these little vehicles dictate mood, energy and well being(Or the opposite)and sleeping in sense gives your body time to recharge, thus feeling tired also might led to being sore, understand? Too much pain killers and your tired, the right amount and you feel energy. a dose too strong and your loopy.There is more to it than this but I am not going to write a essay here.    A pain-killer blocks the flow of this and or switches off these switches. This is way it is so easy to become dependant on the, your body makes this stuff. And again an endorphin is very similiar to a morphine molecule.    Good nutrition is imperative and this is why a good diet leads to being and or feeling healthy. With a good balanced diet your body makes all these things naturally, however there are times when it is not enough and you need a drug to help you.    Nowdays if your a little depressed, right away your Bi-polar and TV teaches us that there are drugs for everything. This is not true. Eating right has a lot to do with a lot of things.    ANd I swear by money working better for depression than Ambilify any day!|`|3VaaU2I4aa	Which kind?

oVxr5B3Eaa	Wow, so sounds like your missing every other period... 29 and 27 are normal.. 58 and 56 are double the length of normal. If it continues in a similar pattern of AROUND 28, AROUND 56, 28, 56, then that IS your cycle.. however, if it's jumpy, your just missing periods. Birth control pills can help that but they're not neccassary....    Good luck@!
RmO46Wb2aa	Alcohol is a depressant. When you consume alcohol it affects your cerebrum in your brain causing dizziness, double vision, poor judgement, slower reactions and binge drinking can cause memory loss.

It would depend on where they are located but it is best to avoid skin to skin contact as much as possible.|`|satoCRC6aa	you can still have the virus, and contact the warts,and spread them to others|`|VBMOuIuxaa	as i learned in med school, that once you have been diagnosed with genital warts you will have the virus forever, it is almost DEFINITE to pass it (despite visible warts on the exterior) with unprotected sex and it is POSSIBLE to pass it with protected sex. all you need to do to pass the virus is to have skin contact with a partner that has an open portal of entry, i.e. a break in the skin. unfortunately, a break in the skin can be a micro tear (invisible to the naked eye) and usually during the action of sex men and women get hundreds or microabrasions because it is an act of friction rubbing. think about it, if you stay in bed all day and have sex with your partner, about the 6th or 7th time you would start to feel sore down there. so, the moral of this "speech", is to tell you that every partner you have here on out should be told (BY YOU) that you have had genital warts and that with protection, you could still possibly give it to them. hope this helps.     oh, and because you now carry the hpv strain most viulent to cause cervical cancer, you need to make sure you get annual pap smears.|`|s1gEHdBgaa	Yes, you should avoid skin to skin contact!

TXVFZCTbaa	You may want to ask your doctor about Restless Leg Syndrome. While the sensations associated with the condition are usually more of a tingly irritation, accompanied by a desperate urge to move or stretch your legs, some people describe the feeling as intensely painful. It usually occurs when you're still for a long period of time, which may be why you feel it while sleeping. There is medication for it, but my doctor just had me take iron supplements and it seemed to help. It may be that your iron is low. Also, make sure you're staying well hydrated throughout the day and before bed. Either way, definitely talk to your doctor if it continues. Hope that helps.    Ps: As a response to the answer below mine, some people do get intense pain with restless leg syndrome; it's not always just a tingling sensation. It all has to do with the severity and your sensitivity to it.  I think it's worth investigating.|`|0eb5efa701843dadf3c5e74ac84a930baa	Muscle spasms? could be due to lack of calcium or potassium.

9d60a294b6864b585406ddb61a14d757aa	"Sad" is not correct.  Any doctor who carries a license to perform medical procedures can legally perform this procedure.  So any MD, DO, or OD who is licensed to do so in their state can do this.  MD = Doctor of Medicine  DO = Doctor of Osteopathy  OD = Doctor of Optometry.     The problem with choosing a general MD or DO, though, is that they probably don't have the training nor equipment to perform this procedure even though they technically can legally do so.    So my recommendation to you would be to see an MD who specializes in eyes (this would be an ophthalmologist) or an OD.  Both of these doctors are trained to perform this procedure AND can legally do so.  Make sure that OD's in your state are legally licensed to perform this procedure.|`|3dbfb1686ea2a2772f3e03d47af16d08aa	Only ophthalmologist, they are specialist, try and find one that does these regularly

YIs51Vp8aa	The P90X plan is a 6 day per week plan with alternating days of Cardio and resistance (Weight) training.  The resistance training is done by body part so you will want to try not to miss a day.  Each workout is about an hour long and one day per week (yoga day) is 90 min!    I actually had a hard time fitting it in to my schedule.  I travel a lot for work and also have 3 little ones at home (3yr old and 2 yr old twins).  I ended up doing OK but did not complete 90 days.    There is a new program out by Beachbody that is similar in concept but a bit more efficient that you may like. It was created by the woman that created Turbo Jam Chalene Johnson.  It is Called ChaLEAN Extreme.  I am in my 2nd month now and really like it.  The workouts are no more than 45 min (most are 30 - 35) and it gives a great efficient resistance workout.  It is also a 90 day plan but builds more rest days in in addition to being a bit more flexible.

To be safe, use your own from now on and any other item where blood to blood contact could occur. Your father can rid himself of the virus by starting on IntronA injections and an antiviral med that is taken orally each day. He should see an internal medicine doctor, and have a liver biopsy done.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Prevention is better than cure, menstrual cramps aren't something you have to just put up with, but there are literally millions of ways to approach the problem but too many to list here, certainly no room to explain why they work, certainly painkillers aren't going to do anything and you've not tried much if you've only been using painkillers. Here are just a few simple common treatments;     Clary Sage.  An essential oil which naturally supports estrogen production and acts on the pituitary gland to help regulate menstrual problems. Used neat or diluted in vegetable oil you massage it into your abdomen. Better than painkillers as your body doesn't build up a tolerance which could make cramps progressively worse over time.     Cell Salts.  A natural mineral that your body needs for basic functioning so if lacking it can cause problems  when you get cramps take them every 5-10 minutes until the pain stops. Wikipedia explains cell salts http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_salts     Heat.   Heat packs help increase blood flow to the pelvic organs, but cold packs may help too. If heat works for you then try a hot bath with a little lavender oil to help you relax and feel more comfortable.    Herbs.  Try in tea form from a store or supermarket, best fresh but teabags are fine just don't boil as this affects potency of the herb. If not a 'women's blend' try any of these; raspberry leaf, yarrow, lemon balm, black haw, chamomile, red raspberry, wild strawberry, Valerian. Bupleurum (aka xiao yao wan) is a Chinese herbal medicine you take 3-4 tablets 4 times per day for two weeks before your period is due, you can get this from any Chinese herbalist. There are plenty of other herbs to help, try talking to staff in a good herbal store as they will help you. Also try Evening Primrose Oil capsules daily, most health stores and supermarkets stock this as it is a good all-round women's health supplement that helps to regulate hormones. See Sister Zeus http://www.sisterzeus.com     Tampons.  These are to be avoided as they negatively affect vaginal health in turn affecting menstrual health, when they expand they can also add to bloating or expand into the cervix making cramps worse. Instead try to stick to pads, or if you use tampons switch to menstrual cups or softcups. See tampon health web site http://www.spotsite.org and menstrual cup support http://menstrualcups.org     Yoga.  Yoga is good as it has a lot of gentle stretching and breathing excercises, try the book 'Yoga for a health menstrual cycle' by Linda Sparrowe and Patricia Walden, DVD's or there are a lot of sites about yoga. Try this video with postures that would help you - http://www.videojug.com/film/yoga-postur...     Sex.  Masturbating to orgasm helps as during orgasm a hormone called oxytocin is released that causes uterine contractions, this along with relaxation and improved circulation help to ease cramps.    Stretching.  Anything that stretches the abdomen is good. Donkey exercise; kneel on all fours with your back parallel to the floor, hump your back up and then down again to the horizontal position. Salaam; kneel, slope your back, lean on your arms and rest your head on the floor, rest and relax in this position. Half-roll; lie on your back, hugging one knee, roll your body to the opposite side and back.     Acupressure.   A lot of women I know who suffer from extreme cramps go for complimentary treatments such as chiropractors or opt for acupressure or acupuncture. If you cannot afford to see a specialist get a book to teach yourself some basics of acupressure/acupuncture. Some points to stimulate for menstrual cramps are: BL24 (Qihaishu), BL25 (Dachangshu), BL30 (Baihuanshu), BL31 (Shangliao), BL32 (Ciliao), BL34 (Xialiao), CV2 (Qugu), CV6 (Qihai), KI5 (Shuiquan), and KI6 (Zhao Hai). You can find the locations of these points here - http://www.acuxo.com/selections.asp?ques...     Diet.  It can make serious differences but it's bloody complex so if it's something you'd be interested in you'd need to go research yourself. For now get a good balanced diet of nutritious foods rich in essential fatty acids and low in refined sugars, refined carbohydrates and hydrogenated fats. Avoid foods that make you bloated such as salty foods, when bloated drink more water with a little lemon juice as a natural diuretic. Some find dairy and caffeine cause problems  although coffee is good for reducing menstrual flow. Soy should also be avoided as it is notorious for causing problems.     Supplements.   Try taking a good multi-vitamin, omega 3 or flaxseed oil (approx. 500Mg 2-4 times a day), B vitamin complex with 100mg of vitamin B6, Magnesium (100mg every 2 hours during menstruation), and vitamin E in d-alpha tocopherol form (50mg 3 times a day). It sounds complex but for a start try a multi-vitamin daily and increase magnesium, calcium and potassium during your periods as these are needed by your body to help uterus lining shed.     Attitude.  It really does have a big influence, obviously good attitude means a woman is more likely to learn what she needs to better deal with her periods, but moods have influence too  for example if you are stressed your period will be more difficult, so eliminate any stress from your life.    If cramps are bad or continue see your doctor, but be careful as many doctors prescribe the pill as a quick-fix, this is a problem b|`|9NrmdSdkaa	the natural way would be   - hot water bottle or heat pad   - rest  - and a bar of chocolate =)    hope you feel better soon   x|`|zhk8o514aa	The women "happy pill"  which is  Pamprin|`|AA12220361	Some Water pills may help.

ItJzrvQ4aa	sure!     buy:   a little sack of potatoes.   a little sack of the cheapest rice.   One bottle of vegetable oil.   one little pack of tomato paste.   a couple of big cabbages - cabbages are dead cheap this year, one   pound goes for 20 p or around.   a pack of the cheapest local apples.   the rest - spend on carrots, they are dirt cheap this year too, like   30 p per pound or something.     Dishes.   1. Wash the potatoes good with skin. Drop them into the pre-heated oven.   Bake until crispy, eat with skins - for a lot of vitamin C.   2. Wash the potatoes, cut them along in four. Salt them. Place on an oiled   cookie sheet into a preheated oven. Bake till crispy and turn from   time to time - these are home-made oven-baked potato chips!   3. Cut the cabbage into long stripes. Put in a pot, add salt, let it   stay. When it started "crying" - letting out the juice - squeeze it   with your hands to remove the juice. Put squeezed cabbage stripes   into a casserole dish. Add half a glass of water and five table   spoons of oil. Put into the pre-heated oven. Stew till it's mild. At   the last minute, and not before, add two table spoons of tomato   paste. Let is stew for five more minutes, take it out. This is a   cabbage stew.   4. Boil some potatoes in water. Peel them. Prepare the cabbage stew   as in the previous recipe. When the stew is ready, add the potatoes.   Then add tomato paste, stew for five more minutes - this is a   vegetable stew.   5. Put some rice into the casserole dish. Add water to just cover the   rice. Add vegetable oil, two - three tablespoons. Add salt. Put into   the preheated oven, bake it there will ready - steamed rice.   6. Do as in the previous recipe. Plus,grate a carrot or two on a   grater. Put then into   a preheated frying pan with vegetable oil. Stir fry till they are   lightly golden. Add then to the rice, bake the rice in the oven for   some more time - this will be rice with vegetables.   7. Do as in two previous recipes. After you fried the carrots, add   some tomato paste to the frying pan, and fry it for a minute more.   Add the carrots and tomato paste, bake for a couple of minutes more -   this will be a "lazy pilau".   8. Peel some potatoes. Put in a casserole dish, add water to cover   them. Add vegetable oil, salt. Put into the preheated oven, bake till   ready, at the last minute add tomato paste - it's stewed potatoes.   Use apples you bought and carrots as snack. Wash them and carry with   you, whenever hungry - snack on them.   There are cheap Chinese and other places, which sell milk by a glass.   It costs little, like 1-15 p. Go there and drink a glass a day - this   will be your protein source.|`|ToztjpAsaa	Cook some food in bulk using cheap dried ingredients like pulses, pasta and rice as base.

According to Psych Central, a site created and run by psychologists,   "Bipolar disorder, also known by its older name manic depression, is a mental disorder that is characterized by constantly changing moods. A person with bipolar disorder experiences alternating highs (what clinicians call mania) and lows (also known as depression). Both the manic and depressive periods can be brief, from just a few hours to a few days, or longer, lasting up to several weeks or even months. The periods of mania and depression range from person to person  many people may only experience very brief periods of these intense moods, and may not even be aware that they have bipolar disorder."    It can be very stressful to help someone that has these issues, this has an overview of ADHD and support groups for it:  http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides.to...    and this sites has an overview of bipolar disorders and treatments:  http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides.to...

Sketsos often talk to themselves (untreated ones I mean) and the two voices will be different.  Untreated, they are scared all the time.  Everyone and everything, is out to get them.  I was not with my friend early on in her illness so am not sure about the mood swings.  But she did tell me one thing she would do as she started to get "sick", was get in the car and go driving....really really fast.  The way my friend got diagnosed...wasn't easy I understand.  Her neighbor recognized she had a sever problem and got her into her car and hauled her to the local Mental Hearth Office.  Was hard to get her there but well worth it.

VnLaUS3Jaa	keep doing what you're doing and incorporate weight triaining.    When weight training, be sure to work ALL of your 5 major muscle groups (core, shoulders, chest, back and legs)     here is an example of a workout program:    MONDAY: shoulders (upright rows, arnold presses, front raises, side raises, reverse flyes),   TUESDAY: chest (flat, decline and incline bench press, push-ups, cable crossovers, scoops),   WEDNESDAY: back (t-bar rows, bent db rows, seated rows, pull-downs, pull-ups),   THURSDAY: core (omg there are so many examples!)   FRIDAY: legs (squats, sumo squats, deadlifts, lunges, leg presses).     do not focus on just one part of the body, as many people tend to do (women tend to focus only on legs, men = chest & biceps)    note: when you do chest (push) exercises you are also working your triceps. when you do back (pull) exercises you are also working your biceps.    to get toned muscles, you want to do 2-3 sets of exercises per muscle group, 12-15 reps at a semi-challenging weight (rated about a 7 or 8 on a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being the highest).    keep a workout log. increase in weight 2-5 lbs per session, reps 3-5 reps per session, and/or sets per session. you will need your log to keep track. don't depend on memory.    just mix things up once in a while as not to feel "routine-like" and seeing your progress on paper as well as in the mirror will keep you growing strong and keep your spirits high!    and of course, you want to eat a healthy diet at least 85% of the time. just follow the food pyramid.

AA11414589	That could actually be a really bad sign you should call your dentist.    They sound extremely impacted which is what causes this pain.    I had the exact same problem. When I was young my dentist told me my wisdom teeth were fine and growing in straight.    I had them grow in and out before without a problem so this time, I didn't think anything of the pain.    I let the pain go and is worsened and worsened (I refuse to go to seek medical attention until pain gets pretty bad, I know I'm stupid)    It got so severse that I couldn't open my mouth anymore, and I could barely eat, in my defense this step happened pretty rapidly.      But it all started with minor ear and throat pain on the side of the erupting tooth.    I went to the dentist and discovered they'd become severely impacted.

We will all die one day, but that's okay, that's what will happen to all of us. I know it is scary to let go of that feeling of control and to just be at peace with that thought, but worrying about it only sucks you of today's joy and sucks the joy of today for your children and loved ones as well.  Heaven is all that awaits us when we pass on and what a lovely place to be!

It is a common feeling among parents actually. I would live for today and make each time count. Make the most of what you get with your children, they grow up all too fast I know. I have one that is now 21 and their childhood is behind them.IF it helps for peace of mind, get a will made up for their provision in case.    I would not focus on the issue of dying if you have no life threating illness.  Be thankful for good health and the time you have with your children.Try to appreciate the here and now and not let this ruin that.    I would not live in the what if mode as that can decrease or ruin your happiness in what you have right now instead. Children live what they learn, do not let them feel so fearful on what you project any in that.    It's good you are getting some help but I would remind yourself that 90% of what we worry about doesn't suddenly happen according to statistics. Alot of it never comes to pass. But we will all die one day, just enjoy each day until then. Living in fear of it can rob you of fully living your life I feel.    I would not spend so much time on that focus but just live each day with the thankfulness that you woke up feeling good to be part of that.    Take life one day at a time, if you have healthy children and you are in good health as well what more can you ask or hope for really in life?

If you are feeling that low maybe you need you medication reviewed (speak to your doctor), alternatively if you are seeking a psychologist then let them know. They can help you alter your thoughts.  One way to avoid fear of dying is reflect how this will effect the children in the long run.You going to teach them (not now but later), if one cannot solve their issue they can choose to die. Research says parents that have chosen to die before their time may influence their children to do the same later in life. e.g. many of the children of that family will choose to die early too. Please you are the children's role model - that is not a form of parenting that I would ever consider promoting.   Please your have a health condition that is treatable. Choosing to die is a long-term solution to a short-term problem, e.g have you ever heard someone having depression all their life? Eventually with the right treatment your depression will subside and you will able to have a happy life with your children.

It is MORE likely that your "popping" represents a muscle tendon that rides over some bony part and as it settles over the other side you feel and possibly hear the Pop.    If you are particularly worried about it, perhaps you could see your family doctor and they can examine you and determine exactly what it is.

Or try searching online to see if this has happened to someone else. Try googling "mirena hanging out of body" or something like that.    Good luck xx|`|1nk8WPrtaa	This is an emergency! Take the kids with you.     Or else just yank it out. Whats your other option?|`|x3EPqezJaa	The Mirena is not that big. If it's hanging out of your vagina, then that means it passed through your cervix. I'd call the doctor and tell him that, and that you're in a lot of pain. Bring the kids to the doc's.|`|1lmSoo2daa	just take your kids with you or you kan send the kids to your relatives for a couple of hours...|`|AA10041941	woman you need to just GO.. get a babysitter..take them with you whatever JUST go.. that is NOT safe!!
pvYy6iTSaa	Ariom - You may need another doctor who can communicate more clearly with you.  Your gallstones may or may NOT have anything to do with your anemia.  Of the 3 chemical types of gallstones, the only one connected with anemia is made up of calcium bilirubinate.  The bilirubinate comes from red blood cells (RBCs) which break up (hemolyze) and release their bilirubinate.  These are commonlyt small, black stones, often with tiny spikes on the surface.  This break up commonly happens in persons with a condition called hemolytic anemia whic can be diagnosed with some lab tests.  In such cases, liver is a bad treatment because liver, which contains a lot or iron used in making RBCs, is not the problem in hemolytic anemias.  Besides, if you needed iron there are oral medicines and red meats instead of the heavily cholesterol-rich liver.    Gallstones are small, hard pellets that can form in the gallbladder, a sac-like organ that lies under the liver on the right side of the abdomen. Most people with gallstones don't even know they have them. But in some cases a stone may cause the gallbladder to become inflamed, resulting in pain, infection, or other serious complications.    Pigment Stones. Pigment stones are composed of calcium bilirubinate, or calcified bilirubin. Pigment stones can be black or brown.    Black stones form in the gallbladder and are the more common type. In fact, they represent 20% of all gallstones in the US. They are more likely to develop in people with hemolytic anemia (a relatively rare anemia where red blood cells are destroyed) or cirrhosis (a scarred liver).    Consider getting another opinion, best obtained from an internist hematologist physician who deals daily with blood disorders such as anemia, especially one who will answer your questions.|`|AA11631715	gb pain is usually triggered by high fat foods, like fries.  "Severe" anemia would be treated with a transfusion. You should be referred to a surgeon for the gb, and take vit/mineral supplements and eat a diet rich in iron, but low in fat.
8b605189bffd91d0497498eabf8d3d17aa	I'm also slightly anemic but you would need to know which type you have, eating iron rich foods will not help the type of anemia I have as my bone marrow is not producing enough red blood cells, further testing would have to be done to determine your type.    My hematologist described me as being "inappropriately normal"....Whatever that means :)|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	it depends on the cause of the anemia, there are different kinds of anemia you know.  Suggest that if a doctor has told you you're anemic, he would also have told you what to do about it... and if a doctor didn't tell you, then you don't really know you are.|`|w2YtTa4Zaa	eat more green vegetables|`|gNBKvQuMaa	The NURSE doesn't KNOW this answer....DUH, you NEED IRON!!  WHY are you, well because your diest isn't getting enough IRON, also like millions you likely drink and eat PASTEURIZED DAIRY!!? RAW DAIRY is BEST and what they brag about in the commercials on their dairy is ONLY TRUE ABOUT RAW DAIRY NOT PASTEURIZED!!  Bet the NURSE cannot tell us where the FIRST child gets Head Lice either, likely she will say from another child but wouldn't that be the 2nd child.Go back to school and get a degree in REAL FOOD.Increasing your Greens dark greens is good, organic and local are best, as is raw or slow slow fermented, IRON SKILLET cooking and ORGAN Meats...yuck but definately there, RAW MILK and dairy NOT the other...These are likely the best ways to get this back into your system vs supplements though likely a doctor will give you one and if its the liquid ohhhh its nasty...Change your diet and you will eliminate this anemia as did I and my kids.
gXne4VJcaa	I work in an urgent care, walk in clinic. If you go into be seen for an ear infection they will do what a normal Dr.s office would do. Weight, Temp, Blood Pressure, Then the doctor will examine the ears and possibly the throat. They will NOT draw blood for an ear infection.|`|TudZYPN5aa	why would they draw blood for an ear infection?    they'll look in your ear and give you medicine.

8rMgQv15aa	Calves are really tough to gain mass because you use them so much in your every day routine (like walking obviously). I had  A LOT of trouble getting my calves to get bigger, but I found a lot of different kinds of workouts to get them where i wanted them. If you do the same calf workouts all the time you will not see any results because your muscles get accustomed to what you are doing all the time. You need to switch up the exercises you do to keep your calves guessing. It is best to get about 6 different exercises and do about 3 of them for 3 weeks straight then switch it up every 3 weeks so your muscles don't get used to what you are doing. The more you switch it up the more results you will get.    I found a great website for a great all around routine. Check out the site below for more details.|`|2prQwRz9aa	Weight machines are grt but I got cut calves from doin ballet! Most of the on toe lifts and  floor routines require you to use mainly your calves to lift your body, Its a killer workout.    Dont know if you kno much about dance but you can look it up, start in 1st position (heels together, toes apart) and do relivies (Hold onto a chair and just rise to your tip toes (the balls of your feet that its, never put full wieght on just your toes without proper shoes)) Lots of reps of these especially holdin weights is bound to get them muscles burning!|`|5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	i read this somewhere some time ago, not sure where.  if you want to strengthen your calves the best thing to do, is to find a sandy area, like a beach.   run down it for 50m, turn and run back up. so you basically run 50m between two points on the sandy beach or loose dirt if thats what you have. you keep doing this till your calves are burning. this apparently strengthens them.     or if you dont have loose soil or a sandy beach, i guess you can just do sprints. long distances create muscles with high oxygen efficiency, and they are small. short distance high speed running produces bigger, stronger, more easily tired muscles.   another thing you can do is sit with your feet on the ground and your knees bent at 90*. raise your feet, as if your toes were trying to touch your shin, then lower. do this 30 x 3 times, 3   times a day, this builds the calf muscles which dont get strengthened by running.     and try jump-roping, and pylometrics. (try hurdles, basketball, or just jumping up and down by just using your feet, and not bending your knees much)
AA11193401	get a different DR|`|xQn3rR6Naa	I have Meniere's also and I have to tell you that I have been where you are and probably where you are going. I didn't have the surgery either as I feel that destroying part of my labyrinth isn't going to make any new advancements possible. That being said, I can only tell you that the doctor was probably laughing at the perception that medical science can "fix everything". No, he shouldn't have laughed at you, but doctors are not magicians and they simply don't have all the answers for this disease. If you don't feel comfortable or respected at this physicians office, then by all meas find someone else. I have been to three different doctors however, and no one could offer anything that the first one didn't. It simply is something that we have to manage the best way we can. I have lost all hearing in my left ear and still have ringing and occasional dizzy spells that usually can be linked to too much salt in my diet. I can count on it that if I eat potato chips or pretzels I will suffer for it the next day. I was told many years ago that when my hearing was finally destroyed that the symptoms would "burn out". This has been small comfort other than the fact that I can't place where sound is coming from and have to always ask "where are you " in the house. I try to avoid loud noises and group gatherings because I can't distinguish voices in crowds and I am vigilant about protecting my good ear from loud noise and music. My husband knows to always sit on my left side to spare me from always having to say "I couldn't hear you", and some people think me rude and aloof because I don't always acknowledge their greetings.   Stay on a low salt diet. It really does help. and play a radio softly when the ringing interferes with sleeping. Everyone has disabilities. Some are of character, some of hearing or more visible ones like a limp but you will learn to manage.|`|VDbTD2njaa	I would smoke him|`|wWS29HTBaa	Get real close in a professional way and uppercut his jaw.|`|RdgSFkBLaa	No matter what the situation, I believe that a doctor is a professional and should maintain himself when with a patient. If a doctor laughed at me for any reason I would never see him again. You can get your records and find a new doc. I would definately get another opinion. You could also find a homeopathic doctor for a different approach. Dont let one doctor stop you from finding the help you need. Good luck!|`|lxa5L3apaa	Regardless of the situation, that behavior was unprofessional.  You should get a second opinion. You may or may not get the the same diagnosis but what would a second opinion hurt.      I had a health problem several years ago and saw a dr. every month or so for it.  Everything he tried failed, and he "jokingly" told me he was getting tired of seeing me and laughed.  I resolved that by seeing another dr. and finally got the real help I needed. See someone else.|`|EeTs9DqUaa	If you feel he is not helping you why not find a new doctor?

8PEtIt1baa	It typically takes about 3 weeks to see the full affects of this class of medications (SSRI).  So, it may take a couple weeks for you to see some improvement in your mood.  I'd give it some time and if things don't get better I would recommend asking your doctor to change you to a different SSRI such as Celexa (generic citalopram) or Lexapro (not available generic yet).  Sometimes these types of drugs lose their effectiveness, this is called 'SSRI poop out', so a completely different drug class might work better as well.  This would be something like Effexor (generic venlafaxine) or Cymbalta (not available generic yet).  If you don't start feeling better after a couple weeks I would talk with your doctor about these other options.  Hope this helps.|`|SfdTlJ6Vaa	I was on Zoloft for a while. And when I upped my dosage, it made me feel awful for a couple weeks actually.     Though upping the dosage only worked for a small time, and I ended up having to switch.     With anxiety and depression, if the Zoloft doesnt work, mabey you should suggest trying something different. I am taking now Effexor, and it works wonders.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	same thing happened to me on Zoloft, you see when the depression is dealt with by the zoloft, the cause of the depression which is anxiety and panic come to the fore.  Zoloft does little for anxiety and panic, it deals with depression, I would suggest that this is more than your regular doctor can deal with, you should see a psychiatrist, a doctor that is trained to deal with mental health issues and knows a great deal more about the medications involved than your regular doctor.  You may also want to consider a therapist to find the root causes of your anxiety and panic, if you deal with those, you may be able to get off of meds altogether.  I know I did.|`|aKBqMLuhaa	To add to the first answer ....  If your not in therapy, you should be in order to get the tools to battle your depression and anxiety. Meds only assist in the day to day but what really needs to happen to cure yourself is some inner reflection and learning to cope naturally.  Depression is not only a chemical imbalance, and needs to be addressed by both meds and therapy.
x3EPqezJaa	Wow, a lot of stuff going on here.  1) Guys know breasts. They've been thinking about them every 5 minutes since age 12, and spend much of their days checking them out while trying to not look like they're checking them out. So the littlest differences is noticeable to them, because they're connoisseurs.  That said, his comments verged on the inappropriate. But I suppose the comments were OK because they were relevant.     2) Even if you haven't had a period in a long time, you could still be pregnant--and not know it, because of the usual lack of a period. So ti makes sense to check it out. I dont' think your bras would make your breasts hurt. Painful breasts suggest hormonal activity of some kind. That doesn't necessarily mean pregnancy--it could mean increased ovarian activity, for example.     I think you should see a reproductive endocrinologist. They specialize in fertility and the endocrine system, and are also gynecologists. Basically, they're endocrinologists AND gynecologists. They'll likely be good about detecting why you haven't had your period in so long, and how to change that fact.     3) As for PCOS: it's an endocrine disorder in which your body has insulin resistance. This means that your body doesn't respond properly to insulin, and this causes other problems: your body produces very large amounts of insulin in order to get enough into your cells, and your body then produces too much testosterone, and this messes up your ovaries and they dont' work right and you dont' get a period, or get periods only occasionally. And you're usually infertile. Metformin makes your body more sensitive to insulin, so it doesn't have to produce as much--your insulin levels might go back to normal, and then your testosterone levels will respond by going back to normal, and then your ovaries will respond by working right, and then you're fertile again and voila, pregnancy!    4) Prenatal vitamins have no effect on these issues we've discussed. And he can't tell if you're pregnant from your boobs--but it is true that pregnant women's boobs grow and get more firm. So one of many explanations of more firm boobs is pregnancy, and he has to do a test to rule that out.|`|145f9a95b73fc930d5481d771b203c24aa	metformin is so called a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent that seen to be effective in treatment of polycystic ovarian syndrome.  firm breasts is an indication of pregnancy, but as you have not you period for long time, its unlikely to be pregnant anyway.    metformin works as it induce the ovary to ovulate, as the ovaries give one or two eggs each month so you will cwrtainly have your period or become pregnant.. metformin erases to some extent negative effect of estrogen on ovaries to stop ovulation.  while estrogen effect on the ovaries erased and the prolactin level is back to normal, this will surely make you ovulate and have period.  as you have a pitutary tumor as you say, this makes hormones unbalanced or overproduced to extent may erase your period, your doctor is trying to make your ovaries ovulate without using any central (pitutary) medications.

emNCaAq7aa	Since you praise a fake meat I guess you are thinking of animals other than people. I don't know about a disorder name for hunters.  Having no feelings for others, only yourself is what most serial or enjoyment killers have. It is usually called being a sociopaths or psychopath. Not all of them get their kicks from killing but they do enjoy the power of controlling things, animals people or objects, for their own satisfaction.  You do know, don't you, that most serial killers have a history of animal torture (not hunting or killing for food) and fire setting when young combined with a bed wetting problem.    edit: I can assure Yogi that it is not from a tumor. I interviewed many sociopaths who killed and none had any major medical problems.|`|rLsphyqhaa	I think most cases they have a tumor of some kind in the brain and it is causing them to do things not right.

But he passed the sanity test, he knew exactly what he was doing, and he only did it because, very simply, he thought it was fun.

fkbJ081Maa	Well firstly rid the house of any junk food and snacks chocolates, crisps full fat yogurt, cookies, bread etc. Fill the bowls with oranges, apples, satsumas, flavoured rice cakes etc etc. Throw out the soda' (don't replace with fruit juice as that is just as bad. I don't like diet soda's but in extreme cases like this diet sprite, fanta etc can help. Fill the fridge with skimmed milk, low fat yogurts and low fat cram cheese etc. You mom could make him healthy chips - like coating the potatoes in a bit of oil and putting them in the oven - they come out great. You can make his favourite foods in a health way like removing the skin of the chicken coating it in breadcrumbs and spices and sticking it in the oven. Comes out just as good - just dont tell him how it is been cooked. Plus spice up your food with garlic, ginger, herbs, spices make it a bit exciting for him. (just don't call it a diet).    Address the laziness issue - the whole family should refuse to get him anything. Plus maybe as a family you could organise a couple of things over weekends and evening to get him moving like countryside or park walks, mountain biking, football etc etc. If he is school age then maybe do away with the bus pass if it is walking distance. I remember these kids who lived near me were really overweight and they used to catch the bus to the chip shop which was less than 100 meters away and catch it back home. Does he do any housework or chores - maybe get him to do the washing up, vaccuming etc etc. If nothing else works disconnect the tv.      If your brother is under 18 then cut off any extra money he gets as this is only been spent on food which is actually slowly killing him. Also sometimes people don't realise how much they are eating so why not try and write everything he eats or drinks in a day work out the calories and talk to him about it.|`|d861778018432f5f26321e9fa06ec7faaa	He is a growing boy. Does he play a lot of sports and needs to refuel often?|`|twVyisGnaa	Your brother developed this lifestyle on his own, and frankly, it's the wrong lifestyle.  You and your family need to cut him off from fatty and oily foods completely.  Start with avoiding to buy chips and stuff like that.  For his dinners, only feed him what you and the rest of your family eat.  If he doesn't eat it, oh well.  Just keep it up and he'll eventually start eating the food your family eats.  Stop taking him to fast food restaurants and stop bringing him food from those restaurants for a while.  Also, start buying other drinks other than soda, but if you guys still buy soft drinks, make him get them himself.  That would help him get some sort of exercise.  Tell him to watch less tv and to spend more time taking a few walks or jogs and some jumping jacks.  Make him work out with you and your sister once in a while.  Also, your parents can probably force him to do some weight-loss exercises.  Drag him by the ear if you have to.  If he doesn't start taking care of himself soon, he could end up with Diabetes at a super young age, and he's messing up his body way too early, and he could probably end up having an early heart attack.    In a way, I am a little jealous of him.  I'm an 18 year-old who's seriously underweight (106 pounds, height 5'5).  Still, I could never bring myself to eat like your brother can.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Im not sure what you mean, if you are pregnant the only way a pregnancy could end is with either miscarriage or abortion, unless of course you carry to full term and have the baby, then you wouldnt be pregnant anymore. Whatever way a person does it it's either an abortion or miscarriage.    At one month you can take abortion pills such as Mifepristone which is prescribed as a single 600mg dose by mouth with a doctor with you, and this is for terminating pregnancies of up to 63 days gestation. At a month it would be too late to use emergency contraception, 'plan B' is only effective if taken 72 hours after unprotected sex to prevent implantation, fertilization and ovulation, so a month gone is far too late. Herbal emergency contraception may be possible to take that late on, but youd be going from herbal emergency contraception into herbal abortion, which would be a higher dose of the herbs and more intense treatment. You could attempt to perform a home abortion at one month, although at one month it would be leaving it a little and youd need to know how far along you are exactly rather than based on a prediction, its possible to do yourself at home as long as you know how and are responsible enough to go for a medical abortion if your home abortion fails.|`|agiRRK4baa	i don't really think there are any real alternatives to ending a pregnancy. an abortion may be the only option|`|1lmSoo2daa	yES, you dont need to take any pills.

A such an early stage a chemical abortion might be possible, the woman takes tablets prescribed by a doctor.|`|ZbMLigR3aa	No, there are no other ways for a pregnancy to be terminated. It cannot just resolve itself hon.  If this person has the opportunity to take plan b (only effective within 72 hours of sexual intercourse) she could do so, but it is pretty much the same as having an early miscarriage.  If this person is seriously considering her options she should go to planned parenthood, she needs guidance and support no matter what she chooses.|`|x3EPqezJaa	You can take plan B in the first 3 days after unprotected intercourse.  That will prevent pregnancy by causing you to shed your uterine lining, so the egg cannot implant. Some would consider this to be an abortion, but since you're not pregnant till the egg implants, others say it means you're not pregnant to begin with.    By the time a month has gone by, abortion or miscarriage are the only ways a pregnancy will end. A very large % of pregnancies end after only a few weeks, before a woman even knows anything. She might have an especially heavy period, or a late period, but that's it.
etVGNDfGaa	both work just as well....1 is a little more potent than the 3 day..tis why it is a one day deal....i have used the one day in the past and it worked fine...|`|SfdTlJ6Vaa	One day should be fine. I have never had a problem with the one day treatments.|`|GjVCEvmUaa	either one works, I've used them both. I guess it just depends on if you want to do a one day treatment or 3.|`|Po2UqfvWaa	i've done both and either is fine|`|dOeE9GCcaa	The one day is a lot stronger then the 3 day. If its mild I would use the 3 day.
fmSuzK2Aaa	You have to let your parents/dentist know that you are nervous. Aside with giving you additional relaxants such as laughing gs or a pill you can take about an hour before the procedure or you can even ask for IV sedation so you'll sleep through the procedure and you won't remember a thing after wards. Even if you opt to go just with the local anesthesia you need to let your dentist know so that he'll be able to help calm you down and even give you a stronger local anesthetic because a lot of times patients who are really anxiety and nervous don't handle the novocaine and the shots can't get the person numb.   Also, you definitely need to bring your ipod or music player to keep your mind occupied so you won't think about what's going on during the procedure. Good luck! you'll be fine...|`|76nTvO4iaa	Ask if the dentist can give you nitrous oxide while they do the surgery.  You'll still be awake, zone out & not care what they're doing.    Call in advance and ask if that's an option.|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Tell your parents and your dentist, and take the Ipod/mp3 what ever you have. I had impacted wisdom teeth out, i used the anesthesiologist to get relaxed. that kind of stuff is normal now a days.|`|Dxxz5s7Vaa	Let your dentist know you are nervous.  They can maybe give you something stronger or put you to sleep during surgrey.  If not try taking your Ipod so you can listen to some music.    Take a deep breath and relax.  The surgrey will help you get out of the pain you are in.|`|AA11321694	be strong. your doc will give you local anesthesia but please tell your doctor about your nervousness. in the name of surgery every one gets nervous but at the same time we have to be very strong to face it.    good luck !!!
0JcMDnFpaa	First of all, we must understand that there are several forms of Vitamin B.  The primary group of the B vitamins include B1 (thiamine), B2 (riboflavin), B3 (niacin), B5 (pantothenic acid), B6 (pyridoxine), B7 (biotin), B9 (folic acid), and B12 (cyanocobalamin).  In addition, there are numerous sub-groups of the Vitamin B family which are considered less pertinent to human needs, but important to other organisms and some animals.  These include B4 (adenine), B8 (inositol), B13, (orotic acid), B17 (amygdalin), B20 (carnitine), and more.    Some foods which are considered to be high in some of the Vitamin B group are turkey, liver, liver oil, tuna, chili peppers, lentils, bananas, potatoes, and tempeh (soy based).  In addition, molasses and brewer's yeast are good sources of B vitamins.      Other meats, dairy products and eggs are high in vitamin B12.   Oats, barley, wheat bran, avocado, salmon, Brazil nuts (and other nuts) are more good sources of B vitamins.|`|a4993552752cc787c811fe933d03022daa	vegemite|`|EjDcshrlaa	don't forget Brown Rice|`|IXhtDPc8aa	brown bread is great one
e61b6f14e6d908535f36e113ec589f3caa	not sure but when the people refuse to pay the expensive (or in most cases can't pay the prices) the prices will come down|`|36a3ynpJaa	The bottom line is that they still have to rent space and the cost of space is not cheap.  Also they have to pay for insurance now since someone could sprain their neck doing a headstand.  Check colleges since they often offer space for instructors for free and they can charge less.    You have to expect an instructor to make at least $300-$400 a week after paying for the space and other expenses.  A good class will also have a helper so you have to pay for two people.      WIth Bikram, they also have to pay for heat and keeping a place at 95 degrees in winter is not cheap.  The course for certification is VERY pricey even though it only last a week and then you have to pay dues to stay certified and use the Bikram name.  Sadly the price is one reason I don't do yoga anymore either.
AcupskMEaa	Hi there,    the diet pills will not work if the composition of the pills were build by a chemical process, but you have to try a natural diet pill like suplemen it' really a natural for your diet program.  I will suggest you to do what we call diet in slow loosing.    1. have you ever fasting ? do this.  2. eat normally when the time show at 18.00  3. Drink a warm tea, put a little sugar on it  4  eat your meal slow.  5. Shallow a natural suplemen, especially the natural vegetables  6. Choose your diet pill with caffeine free formula.  7. Drink as much as a water drink every morning.|`|dUj7rP2haa	Diet pills don't really work.  At best they may have a minor effect over the short term.  At worse they could make you seriously ill.  The only effective way to loose weight is to eat less and move more.  I really wish there was a magic pill but there just isn't.|`|OXtClQaiaa	I have tried out every diet known to mankind but nothing worked as good as acai berry.  I know they say that pills do not work, but they certainly worked for me, and they've been featured on the Rachael Ray Show too. There's a free trial on currently at http://cedohelc.yakudza.com , give it a try, what have you got to lose?|`|CHaGCTzfaa	Actually, you don't need to diet per se if you want to lose weight, the one diet that clearly showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials remaining, it has been featured in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I lost 30 pounds, it clearly does produce results!

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	It depends what you mean by barely get periods and also depends why you dont get periods regularly, if it is just that your cycle is long or you skip periods due to your weight or issues such as stress then yes you can still get pregnant. Youd need to go back to your doctor to find the cause of the missing periods, I would also strongly recommend using Fertility Awareness Method (FAM) which is used for pregnancy achievement, as a reliable form of birth control and for general sexual health. The latter being the important point here as with FAM you will be able to see exactly what is going on within your body and with your hormones on any given day, thus you will be able to see if there are any problems with lowered hormone levels, from that you can approach your doctor for help or deal with the problem yourself, depending on where the problem lies. For you FAM will also help you because it will tell you when your periods are due and will help you get pregnant when you do choose to try for a baby, its easy enough to learn how to use FAM and it has a lot of benefits. Oh and birth control does not regulate anything that is myth as birth control works by suppressing your cycles so although your periods can be forced to come at certain times it does not regulate anything. Once you know the cause youd have a better chance of getting treatment of some kind and saying whether-or-not you can get pregnant.|`|PyneTJPmaa	Yes,|`|dV9MRBfwaa	lol try it out? You went to the doctor? Why dont you ask him/her?|`|Hbvquautaa	You sure can still get pregnant! I get my period about every 6-7 weeks or sometimes less. One time I didn't get it for 4 1/2 months. I'm not on birth control either, and basically the nurse tells me that a) every woman is different and hormones are changing all the time and b) stress can play a huge part on your cycle. So I think you're ok, just be glad you don't have it as often as everyone else!|`|3cLWlMQxaa	You should be thankful you rarely get them. You may get pregnant, rare periods could be due to malnourishment or simple you're born that way. Be thankful anyway. We all hate having ours.|`|utHfUAPtaa	Are u over or under weight cos that can make ure periods unregular,also get some bloods taken and ask them to check everything    and yes the pill can help regulate your periods,and for the pregnant part i really don't kno but i think it would be hard to get pregnant when you don't have regular periods,but hey am no doctor so i dnt really kno    all the best|`|e880bf3780c6ebc1868c580fec232f00aa	Yeah..  luckyy in a way|`|QBa60Hvfaa	yes you can deary.|`|n7BuH75gaa	lucky you.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	Sure...but it may take more time...didn't you ask the Dr???|`|tcPaHzkUaa	You are not pregnant .some women don't get a regular cycle.It skips sometimes .Mine does too.Like i went 3 months without one.And im not pregnant.
1U9YtSW3aa	First the Good News  *** is an all-natural bodily fluid that doesn't harbor any diseases or harmful bacteria in a healthy person. The purpose of semen is to transport sperm to the female ova, and it is a high-protein, nutrient-rich medium designed to support and sustain the spermatazoa during their relatively brief journey. The sperm themselves also present no threat in the digestive tract, and are neutralized by gastric fluids by the time they reach the stomach.     If anything, swallowing the *** of a healthy male may in fact be good for you, since it is a highly concentrated source of protein, minerals, natural sugars, and other nutrients. Healthy seminal fluid is mostly fructose and proteins, and doesn't contain any harmful chemicals. The slightly bleachy smell of semen comes from its alkaline pH and minute traces of chlorine, but if it's mild enough for a vagina, it's not going to be any harsher on your mouth or throat.     Because the ducts and glands that produce the components of semen feed into the urethra, the same passage that carries urine out of the penis, *** may pick up some traces of urea or uric acid. However, these are harmless, as is healthy urine in general. The urinary tract of a healthy person contains only trace amounts of bacteria, and there are no substances in urine that are harmful to consume in the quantities excreted normally.     The Not-so Good News  The sort of good news is that swallowing your partner's *** will not put you at any greater risk for catching an STD. The flip side is that if your partner does have an STD, by the time you've had unprotected oral sex with them, whether you swallow or not, you've been exposed to whatever they're carrying.     Having unprotected oral sex (giving a ******** without a condom) is risky. Some of the disease that can be transmitted through oral sex if your partner is infected include herpes, genital warts, gonorrhea, chlamydia, and syphilis. The risk of HIV transmission through oral sex is still undetermined. Some experts say there is little to no risk of getting HIV through fellatio, while some say there is possible risk, especially if there are cuts or sores in the mouth of the person performing oral sex.     Because most of the STDs mentioned are transmitted through contact with sores or lesions on the genitals, or are present in the pre-ejaculate fluid (precum), a person performing unprotected oral sex on an infected partner has already been exposed even before their partner ejaculates. If your partner cums in your mouth, you may be exposed to additional quantities of STD pathogens in the semen, which can infect you through the mucous membranes in your mouth and throat or through small cuts or scrapes on the inside of the mouth.     However, if you've already gone that far, swallowing the semen isn't going to put you at much additional risk. If anything, once the *** is in your mouth, swallowing may be the quickest way to get rid of it. Once you've swallowed, your digestive enzymes and acids will probably destroy any germs in the semen, and your stomach and intestines are not vulnerable to infection by STDs.     If your partner has *** in your mouth and you are concerned about STDs, you can minimize your risk by either quickly spitting or swallowing. The point is just to get the *** out of your mouth quickly one way or another. Then whether you've spit or swallowed, gargle and rinse your mouth thoroughly with a 3% hydrogen peroxide solution (the type available in drug stores for first aid). This will kill any germs in your mouth and throat and wash them out of cuts in the mucous membranes.    But It Made Me Barf  Although there is nothing in healthy semen that can cause illness, some people get nauseated or even vomit during or after performing fellatio. This is a result of the gag reflex being triggered and is not a cause for alarm. The gag reflex is a way that your body protects you from choking, and is activated when something - like the head of a **** -- touches the back of the throat, stimulating certain nerves. If the reflex is stimulated enough, it may cause involuntary vomiting. The gag reflex can be controlled by practicing relaxation techniques. If this is a persistent problem, you may want to try a different angle when performing fellatio.     Other people may become nauseated after swallowing semen for psychological reasons, or because they find the taste or consistency of the semen unpalatable. If you find oral sex or semen repugnant, addressing underlying psychological causes may be necessary. If the taste or consistency of the semen itself is objectionable, there may be dietary changes that your partner can make to improve the flavor of his spunk.     The Bottom Line  Unprotected oral sex, whether you swallow or not, is risky if you don't know your partner's health status. Oral sex without a condom, whether or not your partner cums in your mouth, can transmit several STDs, if your partner is infected. However, swallow|`|iwEpYKlMaa	yes, you can get your daily supply of protein.|`|KXfGa4Quaa	wow...     i don't think there are any health benefits......|`|7e7d166a3ed7f7056d84be116e5d0ae0aa	The protein is prolly about it.|`|mYw6KMIDaa	Other than a low amount of calories you shouldn't drink semen.

On the bright side it's not bad for you.|`|VnLaUS3Jaa	someone once told me that sperm is non-digestive and builds up inside of the body if swalled.    now, i don't know how reliable this source is, but i do very little of that anyway, so i didn't really worry about it once they told me.    as far as health benefits, i do know that sperm contains protein and antioxidants. it has been recommended that it be applied to the face as a mask for anti-aging purposes.    it probably also depends on how healthy the "donator" is. if he does drugs or eats poorly, the sperm is probably not going to be all that good for you. if he takes care of himself and lives a healthy lifestyle, then i would say that his sperm would be of benefit to you... be it minimal.    and some of the others make an excellent point about STD's. be careful.|`|EMbaak9waa	Well woman swallow it while giving oral sex and nothing has happened that i've heard of.

6e58ce6577be3f4549253fc7148b5e1caa	I have never taken plan b, but the pill is to be taken after you have had unprotected sex to stop you from getting pregnant.  The pill can be taken up to 72 hours after the unprotected sex occurs.  The one side effect that I am aware of is it will mess up your periods.  You can obtain the plan b pill from any Walgreen's if you are over the age of 18.  I think it costs about $50.00.  If you are younger than 18 I believe you will need to have an adult with you.  But remember that the plan b pill is not contraceptive and should not be used as such.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	http://www.go2planb.com    You take it after sex if the condom fails or something, it's pretty effective at preventing pregnancy if taken quickly. Some women get nausea or dizziness. It can also make the periods irregular for a couple of months. You can buy it from any pharmacy (depending on your age and where you live). If you're in the USA and under 18 you'd need to see a dr or Planned Parenthood.    Harriet|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Plan B is a large dose of hormones designed to stop any fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus.  If the person is already pregnant, it will not effect the pregnancy as in abortion.  It costs about $40-60 depending on where you buy it, and in the US, you need to be 18 years old to purchase it without a prescription.  It can be bought at the pharmacy counter in most any drug store.  It needs to be used within 72 hours of the sexual encounter to be effective.    hope this helps..

I have dealt with this disorder for almost 7 years now, I have also cut several times in the past as well as tried to commit suicide at least 10 times. Not only have I been self destructive in the past, but a few of my alters have as well. I have, at this point in time, 7 known alters.    I would never consider such situation to be a hostage situation, even in the case where an alternate personality is in control.    Think of it this way, someone without DID/MPD who threatens to kill themselves is not only emotionally unstable, but is also in need of serious help.  It's the same for someone who has DID/MPD. We only have more "people" who are emotionally unstable and in need of help.

These choices where not your fault, but rather just not understanding why you sought such people. The sarcasm is a result of projecting your fear that you will not be taken serious and not accepted. It is actually creating a cycle where people will indeed reject you and talk behind your back because they are unable to see the authentic beauty of you. The way to help yourself is to observe how you are feeling at the time when a sarcastic comment pops out. Deal with that. It is about how you are feeling. If soemthing does slip out know that it takes at least 21 days to change a habit...so say I am sorry, that might have been amusing but in truth I really feel ----{this way} so please forgive me.   Then in your mind let it go, saying in your mind "I love you, please forgive me, I forgive you, thank you." Make this your new mantra. You will be openning up to very deep healing that will allow you to accept and believe and love yourself to such a point you will feel perfectly comfortable showing your inner beauty to those friends you attract.|`|1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	It's pretty simple....just think about what you want to say, give yourself ten seconds, then say something else.

I understand they say that pills will not work, nevertheless they definitely worked for me, and they've been featured on CBS News too. There is a free trial going on at the moment at http://nefocils.oparch.com , try it out, what is the worst that could happen?
ufgv7oTjaa	Yes, I was going to say Vitamin D would be better for mood and there are many people who feel more depressed during the winter because of it.. more severe cases are even called Seasonal Affective Disorder.     Anyway, Fish Oil is good for cardiovascular health, brain health, skin health, and many other benefits in the body. The recommendation should be listed in the bottle and is commonly 3 softgels (often 1,000 mg each) throughout the day and that's a general guideline.  Vitamin D has an RDA of 400 IU, but most people that have researched Vitamin D agree that is too low. The general recommendations for supplemental Vitamin D is 1,000 IU daily or 2,000 IU daily during the winter. Some doctors recommend more during the winter and/or less during the summer depending on sunlight exposure and severity of Vitamin D deficiency.   When your skin is hit by sunlight, it naturally produces it's own Vitamin D, so if you get enough sun during the summer, you probably wouldn't need (and shouldn't take) supplemental Vitamin D... but that would vary based on your particular need.    As far as brands, any answer given here will just be personal opinion (I can give you my opinion if you'd like). There are many higher quality companies out there that are readily available and well priced... just make sure the company has a good rating with either the GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) or USP (U.S. Pharmacopoeia), as those are the main quality assurance organizations (USP is for the U.S., GMP is for the U.S. and worldwide).  Good luck and I hope I helped!|`|n7qcfWxkaa	Good-quality fish oil gives me that nice, relaxed feeling.  Barlean's is the best brand I've found. It's not cheap, but it doesn't taste fishy at all, and two capsules make me feel better in less than an hour. They're sold in health stores in the refrigerated section.    I don't know much about Vitamin E, sorry.
ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	No. It doesn't work. Just diet and exercise. More going out than going in. That is the only trick. Eat health and exercise. I've been running 2 miles 3 times a week for 6 months. I've lost 8 lbs. doesn't sound like much, but I can tell you there is way more to it than weight loss. I feel better than I have in years. Keep working.|`|S730dpLfaa	Angel,  I lost 21 lbs last month! Acai Berry really works but you need to read this blog to avoid scams  http://acaiberryscams.wordpress.com/2008...  There are many people around which complain that Acai Berry does not work, but they don't know that they're using fake products!  Thanks to this blog, it helped me a lot to choose the best.  Hope this helps :-)|`|Z8d9ipxmaa	Nope, nothing like that works. The guy above me said it all, pretty much. =D|`|OXtClQaiaa	I have used every diet known to man but nothing worked as well as acai berry.  I know they say that pills don't work, nevertheless they definitely worked for me, and they have been showcased on CNN too. There's a free trial going on right now at http://eppenset.zndd.biz , why not check it out, what have you got to lose?|`|yY2Czxy2aa	As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.    The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.    And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.
j2yhjBDiaa	Oh my god-I have it right now & it sucks! It's not common at all for someone my age-early 30's-but is more common in people over 65. Once you've had the chicken pox, which I did as a baby, the virus stays in your nerve roots & can be reactivated in times of extreme stress in the form of shingles. Trippy! I will be soooo happy when this is over!|`|UZxeBrxQaa	Every child who had chicken pox is a potential victim of shingles.    There is a vaccine and failing to get it is not wise.  People who have had shingles have described it as the most painful experience of their lives and the damage can be permanent, as well as having a danger of recurrence of the shingles attacks later.    One study showed 250 cases per 100,000 people.  That number rose five times as the patients got older.    It can be life threatening, and/or have permanent damage result to the body organs|`|tA8T4QYFaa	It's caused by the Chicken Pox virus, so anyone who has had chicken pox (or taken the vaccine) is subject to having shingles. Not everyone develops shingles, and some have an outbreak more than once.|`|IE9NfLGoaa	common...|`|XJGp4AxHaa	It's pretty common as far as I know. Some people have it pretty bad while others don't.|`|0yUnnmdJaa	i have it right now. its very common, most people dont know about it. you have shingles in your body if youv ever had chicken pox, but its actualy chicken pox that died and reactivates in your body to come back as shingles, its a rash that clusters, its localised, also it attacks the nerves, very painful!|`|T16Zmtc3aa	You can't get Shingles unless you have had chicken pox.  But for those who have had chicken pox, shingles more common for people over 60.|`|etVGNDfGaa	shingles is very common...it is actually the same strain as chicken pox...also very contagious!!!!..the only differences between chickenpox and shingles is ...  1 chicken pox you get itchy sores all over the body...shingles is painful sores instead of itchy and they are usually more localized to one area...possible just a band on your chest...or back...again..painful..  2. if you have never had chicken pox and you come in contact with shingles...you will not get shingles..but you WILL get chicken pox...  3. People who have had chicken pox and are exposed to shingles are the only ones to get the shingles...  4. coming into contact with someone with shingles when you have never had chicken pox is very dangerous as an adult...as getting chicken pox as an adult can lead to serious complications and possibly being hospitalized.
sZ5jFgliaa	the first step is acceptance.  write a list, limit it to 10 reasons of why you hate yourself.  and go through each one and accept these reasons, tell yourself that that's who you are and you have to deal with it.  second step is strength.  have strength in everything you do, with confidence, wake up in the morning and tell yourself that you're beautiful.  third step is people.  surround yourself with people that love you and people that make you happy, people that make you feel alive.|`|KTNqah9eaa	No, you're not losing it. You have kept up a relationship for three years and it looks as if your partner is supportive despite the way your run yourself down. From my own experience - I was a solicitor for nearly 20 years and hated it :) - you need to try and find out what you like doing. I tried to discover what bits in my job and in my time outside work I really enjoyed. I worked out because I enjoyed stuff I might either actually be good at it or could become so. And that's what happened. Over two years I got the courage to give up the law and move to the worst paid job I had ever had, but I had never been happier because I was doing what I enjoyed doing. After some more years I became recognised in my new job and started earning more.  For me it took time. It may not for you. I made the change in my late 40s and had to unlearn years of under estimating myself. Of course there are still times, many times, when I think I can't do this, why do people trust me to do this etc. But basically now I'm more honest with myself and a whole lot happier.  I hope this helps a bit.|`|iybezfi6aa	CBT is the way to go. Are you expecting someone else to make you feel better? You are going to have a long wait. Be proactive and do the work.  Sounds to me like you have fallen into the trap of existing for others to compliment you to boost yourself up. This works in the short term, but is addictive and you will quickly need another "fix".  Living with someone miserable is not any life for your partner.  You would both be better off alone.|`|2qPtGTNcaa	If therapy has not helped then you might need medications. I know you don't want this to be a part of your record but almost all of us have something on there that we'd prefer not to have. In the meantime, do positive affirmations every single morning. Do 25 before you even get out of bed. Then do 25 after you eat breakfast. Then, do 25 just before you go to bed to make them the last thing on your mind. After about a week, the repetition will help to train your mind to think more positively about yourself. Good luck to you.|`|mc3JtXc6aa	Have you tried a healing session with an energy work healer? I felt like you some years ago and the reason why is that I have a long family history of crap, so I decided to get rid of it and healing changed my life. It changed my life to such an extent, that after finding out that I had healing abilities myself, I gave up the well paid job I had become tired of, to become a healer myself. The technique is called Applied Energy Flow and Emotional Realignment Therapy. It takes 2-3 sessions (one session a month) to get lasting results. It works long distance over the phone as well, so if you wanna try let me know and we will find a way.
5fMAvu5naa	Your system is sore.It is perfectly natural.Everything needs to heal and get back to normaL.Breast feeding helps everything heal faster.Just take you time healing it isn't going to happen over night.Contact a doctor is you want peace of mind.Yes the pill will help but physically the healing process takes  bit.You have quite an adjustment right now, physically and mentally so enjoy the little one and enjoy your life right now.I see it at work ,first time mothers always have the same generalized feelings and physical reactions.I had the same with my children.But if you want peace of mind contact a doctor, that is what they are there for.Enjoy parenthood , they grow up real fast.|`|bc80b085beb98b92a6819181843ddbbbaa	It happens to a lot of women, it's most common in the first year after giving birth, but it can last forever.  I noticed it most with my first child, and now that my 3rd and last is almost 3 I feel it only on occasion.  However my sister who's youngest is 4 still feels it pretty severely.|`|TiW72sAUaa	Does it feel like pressure?? I get this every month more so since having my second child. It feels like you have had a good kick between the legs.|`|eTTkAv9Yaa	Not happened to me, nor anyone I've ever spoken to about it, if I was you I would speak to my GP, just to put my mind at rest.  It may be that you are just unfortunate and you get cramps there.  It may be something more serious, let's hope not but please get it checked out.
AA11321694	soak your legs in warm water with some salt in it and please give a break to yourself until soreness go completely before running again.  and also see a doctor.|`|3wFt9fyZaa	get yourself some gel inserts for your shoes and take some aleve 30 minutes prior.  Also dont forget to warm up prior to running.|`|RdgSFkBLaa	Shin spints hurt in your shins and runs along the front bone of the lower legs. So probably not shin splints. If your knees and ankles are hurting, you may want to get that checked out (could be stress fracture).   I usually take Ibuprofin to help with muscle soreness and inflammation. If you are still hurting, then try running every other day until the soreness is gone. You should take at least one day off from running a week to allow your muscles to heal.  One other thing you could try is to buy a good quality running shoe. The best place to do that is at a sporting good store that has a treadmill...then you could try them out before you buy. I normally spend around $130.00 on my running shoes...I buy asics which are a great shoe, but not for everyone...try on alot of different ones so you can find one that fits you best. And depending on how much you run, you need to buy new shoes about every 4 months....It sounds like alot, but you just dont realize the difference it will make.
kgKyn68Raa	well the only way to help swelling is with anti-inflammatory drugs and lots and lots of ice. When stuff is swollen its obviously bigger and hard to move because your foot has more stuff to move and in less room to do it. Keep it elevated and ice it. I know its basic but that's all you can really do. Just stay off of it as much as possible as well. The less you use it the more chance your foot has to rest and help the swelling|`|qXpxILnRaa	For a very natural way, just try to relax your toes. Put your feet in some lukewarm water and slowly move your feet like people do in a movie. Also, drink some tea.

Its main trigger is Candida fungus in your digestive system.    Sugar feeds fungus and eating fungus (dairy, breads) adds to your internal flora (fungus). The result is your body over-reacting by (becoming inflamed) attacking fungus all over the body, including skin.    My "cure" is extremely effective: eat Turmeric (500mg pills) 3-6x a day. It is a powerful anti-inflammatory and balances your intestinal flora (fungus).    I have suffered for 33 years with this disease and tried it all. Turmeric is almost a "cure" and is probably more effective than corticosteriods.    Reduce sugars, dairy, gluten, fungus intake and take Turmeric. Keep areas mostened, try not to itch or break skin. Eczema is triggered by several elements, injury to skin is one of them.    Green tea and Salmon oil (omega 3's) should be taken also (Green tea increases the effectiveness of Turmeric many times and vice versa).    Salmon oil, green tea (especially around the eyes with warm moist bags) and turmeric can be applied directly for more relief. Avoid dangerous prescription drugs.    Good luck."

But in most cases it possibly isn't poisenous.  I would reckon that you are simply reacting to the bite.  If you don't get bitten much anyway it is quite normal for the body to throw all its defences to the bitten area.  The effects can be large inflamation, redness, soreness to touch, very hot.  All of which normally dies down after a few days.  However, you do need to watch possible secondary infection due to the bite.  Puss or even an absyss can form.  The infection can start to "track" (which is where the redness starts to spread up the leg - this is serious and would need seeing to).      If the swelling and redness has spreak all the way round your ankle then I would go to the doctors immediatley.  This is because the reaction and swelling can start cutting off blood supply to the foot - not good.    Either way, if in doubt visit the doctors and more than likely they will prescribe you anti-biotics which would deal with the infection.    Hope this helps

AA10003191	Ignore the rant.    There are reams of data that show that in appropriate patients, Plavix is vastly superior to aspirin.

One thing that they just don't stress about this drug (and why would they??? ---- they are trying to sell it to you---- is that it is a cardiac poison.  In the circular that comes with this drug is the fact that it may lead to CHF  (congestive heart failure) and it may do so within 2 weeks of beginning therapy.  Too bad for you if you have the genetic marker.    This is exactly what happened to a friend of mine.... now on oxygen, and was perfectly fine prior to this drug.... He how has to wear a heart stimulator which when his heart stops, sends a charge into the heart, and as well notifies the monitoring station.  His heart now is so weak that in the shower, he has to have oxygen......  the warm water dilates his capillaries, putting additional strain on his heart. The guy was a jogger before this medication!!!!  And since this is in the warnings, ----oh well.    Plavix is a blood thinner, and works no better than 81 mgs of aspirin (baby aspirin).  Take l daily.    Plavix is a drug, trying to find a disease... just like Vioxx was a drug, trying to find a disease when there are perfectly good substitutes for it that don't have these effects.  (interestingly, the cardiac problems with Vioxx were already shown in dogs, yet, Merck covered up the evidence.)    Don't be so quick to jump on the band wagon for "the latest and greatest medications" to come out.    We now know that you can lower your chol. levels by diet, one that works amazingly well is to opt out of fatty meats, fried stuff,  and interestingly, a breakfast every day of the one I'll type out for you below.    Several years ago this breakfast was part of a very small study in Canada of less than 100 people for six months only, and each matched age and chol. levels.  One ate this breakfast every morning, the other group at whatever.  Those who ate this breakfast lowered their chol level 30 point!!!!  I told my doc about it, and he now eats this, and I no longer take a chol lowering drug, which I hated.    So, hon, stay waaayyyy  away from Plavix, eat more veggies, eat this breakfast, have some blood work done before you start and in 3 months, and see how much better your blood chemistry is.    Steel Cut oats, cooked as directed  walnuts  blue berries, or strawberries of raspberries or all three  ground flax seed meal  brown sugar  skim milk    Now for sure, not at neat as pancakes, bacon sausage etc, but hey, I don't want any heart attack or stroke, and it is a small price to pay.... and it's relative bland, so the fruit makes it interesting.    On a day you just don't want this, have a whole grain muffin with butter and cinnimon and sugar.    Omit margarine, and solid peanut butter, and most fried foods, and most oils.  Use only olive oil in your salad dressing.  And because it is no good to fry with, bake things, like chicken or fish.  "Fry" is a four letter word.

AA11704237	Initially, it is imperative for you to understand that BPAD is a very complex mental health condition that needs appropriate treatment and management.  Once this management and treatment is established many people lead full and diverse lives.  However, for those close to the sufferer this can be very taxing.  Many people affected by BPAD often have periods that changes occur within their personality and behaviour.  You need to be honest and open and explain to your partner how you feel.  It maybe a good idea to get some professional support through an appropriate charity or advocate service.  One excellent tool that is used in BPAD management is for the carer to keep a diary detailing the emotions this is useful to assess the effects of the condition and to evaluate what works and indeed what doesn't work.  It is also useful to examine triggers and syptomology and compare whether the BPAD influences your feelings as well as your partners.|`|iybezfi6aa	The two don't necessarily coincide.

Get involved in activities that require physical activity and spend time with friends who really are wanting to lose weight so you can support each other and do it together.|`|d78253b3026406d31c9242c83af40176aa	Hmm...well thats just pretty mean of your sister.     I'm VERY overweight (not just chubby) and I know how hard it is when people put food in front of you - especially if its something you like. And then to have your mom on your sisters side like that must be terrible. I can relate - when my boyfriend and I go out to dinner and I want a salad, he'll constantly push something else on me. I'll stress to him that I'm doing really well on my diet and dont want to ruin it - and he'll go ahead and order the fatty appetizer. When its sitting in front of me, I usually give in and have some. Not supportive of him at all!!!    Next time she buys you food - Just kill her with kindness. Politely say "That was so thoughtful of you, but I'm trying really hard to healthy "       Dont think of it as trying to get thinner than your sister. Thnik of it as trying to get the healthiest you can be.|`|RstbVDSUaa	It is of course annoying when you are trying your best to lose weight and you have someone trying their best to put you off. The first thing is that don't tell here about your fitness plans. Dont workout with her. Ger some privacy away from her and try your level best to get fit.    If you have a sweet tooth and can't seem to resist candy then why not try sweet tasting fruit like strawberries or papaya? If you still find it hard then allow yourself a small treat every now and then to stop cravings.|`|XeK7f9c0aa	Have you ever thought that she does the things she does because she is jealous?  You stated that she was always the thinner one-maybe she doesn't want competion from you because then she would have to take a closer look at herself and do something about her own weight.|`|bcofGbF4aa	Exercise is just as vital as diet when it comes to losing weight, but the only thing which definitely worked for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it was highlighted in Reader's Digest and CNN. I lost 30 pounds, it definitely does produce success!

I'm getting braces in a week.|`|njtGMFw7aa	i just got my braces taken off recently, and it didn't hurt at all. all they do is pull off the brackets. you will feel a little pressure on your teeth, but it doesn't hurt. when they take them off, your teeth will be sore for a couple of weeks, but the soreness should go away once you start wearing your retainer|`|AA12198724	When I had my braces taken off I kept moving and that took even longer. I made the orthodontist mad and he claimed i was his worst patient.  I think he was mad because he was losing another customer plus my teeth were not finished with treatment. Its not bad just dont move a lot and listen to the orthodontist. The kicker is the leftover glue on the teeth. I was so ready to get the hell out of there was a bit on my front tooth for  a while but it eventually went away. It doesnt really hurt much but it beats having to go back every month to get them tightened!|`|KM6wXvy9aa	It doesn't hurt, they use a in-fared gun like they did to dry the glue. They use one to melt it, then they basically fall of. Then they like scrape the rest of the glue off, that doesn't hurt just a little uncomfortable. Then they clean and polish your teeth :)    All worth it in the end  x|`|Qiw9AFkaaa	no it doesn't hurt and in fact it is gonna be so exciting for you slippery smooth teeth; what a great day that was for me! enjoy it!

Maybe put some shades on him so he avoids touching his eyes not sure if that help as a trick but I would try that.  Good Luck and I hope his o.k.

"A child can get pinkeye by touching an infected person or something an infected person has touched, such as a used tissue. In the summertime, pinkeye can spread when kids swim in contaminated water or share contaminated towels. It also can be spread through coughing and sneezing. Doctors usually recommend keeping kids diagnosed with contagious conjunctivitis out of school, day care, or summer camp for a short time.  Someone who has pinkeye in one eye can also inadvertently spread it to the other eye by touching the infected eye, then touching the other one."    Don't take your son to the store.  Your son could infect other people through coughing or sneezing even if he doesn't touch anything.  Maybe you could get a mask from the doctor to keep from spreading the bacteria.
gXne4VJcaa	I had to actually have my gallbladder taken out because of this. I didn't experience much pain but I was sick to my stomach after every time I ate. You should probably have an ultrasound of your gallbladder and see whats up, if it is your gallbladder and they decide to remove it you'll feel so much better!!|`|UfEPAwI4aa	They will probably do an ultra-sound or/and an upper GI.  Those will test for stomach ulcers and gallbladder problems.  I had gallbladder problems (I had it removed).  I mainly was sick at night after about 6-7 hours after eating.

NTln9ULUaa	You are absolutely right to be concerned. My hubby (now 37) was put on Ritalin at a very young age and by the time he was 9 he realized that it made his brain function differently. He grew smart and started flushing them down the toilet.     All 4 of his brothers (27, 16,15 &13) have been on Ritalin or are currently on it. My way of looking at it was this: My MIL was very young when she had my hubby,she still had a life and wanted to live it so she drugged him to do so. She continued to have children right until she was 45. At that time, life had run her down. She couldn't keep up with the boys and didn't have them in any extra curricular activities to keep them occupied and active. So she basically would sedate them.    In October, we had the 13 year old for 1 week. I was told that he can take his meds on his own. One day he didn't, and he realized that he would not be able to unwind to fall asleep that night. He took 10 times the amount of pills that he should have and I had to rush him to hospital to pump his stomach because he OD'd.     I have a 7 year old daughter who the school "diagnosed" ADD/ADHD. I do not take that diagnosis seriously. She does have a learning disability as she is in grade 2 and has JUST learned her ABC's. They are demanding Ritalin and I refuse!    School's do not want to take the time anymore to sit with a student and work through the difficulties that they have. They just push them through to the next person.    Your son is not being stimulated at school. Place him into whatever clubs/groups that you can find. The parks departments offer many sports or clubs at reasonable fees and will sometimes waive a fee due to financial circumstances.     The only person who has a right to tell you how to help your child is YOU or the Pediatrician. If your doctor has no concerns about his developement, then there is no worries.    Do not douse his inner fire with Ritalin. Allow him to be the energetic creative son that he is.|`|jPESbdyyaa	Ritalin is horrible -- it sends kids on a terrible roller-coaster of ups and downs all day.  If you need to medicate him, try Adderall. (That's what I take now after horrible years spent on Ritalin)    It could be that the school is just lazy -- lots of schools nowadays just want to medicate kids to make their lives easier.     My mom was a 4th grade teacher and the 3rd grade teacher always put the kids on meds...my mom would talk to the parents, and have them get their kids tested for ADD/ADHD to find the real problem.  She since quit teaching and started testing/tutoring dyslexic children.    A lot of kids with problems (like dyslexia) act out in class because they are having trouble keeping up and would prefer to be the class clown to being the class dunce.  It may not be ADHD at all...get him tested by the family docotr, NOT someone at the school!     Or, another possibility is that he is exceptionally smart and gets bored in class and then acts out just to have something to do?|`|XUrgcOMDaa	I'm not a master on the subject by any means.... but I heard more fresh, raw fruits and vegetables in his diet will help.|`|zmElE2gTaa	Adderall|`|LJbhOhKuaa	You should find something different or the dose is too high.|`|oofVoI2Vaa	Stop, no matter what.

ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	There's no particular name for this condition that i can think of - it's not even apparent what is going on.     You may need to get an MRI to determine what is going on here - an MRI will show problems with nerves, sometimes muscles, tendons, and vertebral discs.    One way to approach this is to visit an orthopedic specialist, ask if an MRI is warranted, and see what the doc has to say.  If it looks like a muscle problem, have the ortho write up an order to send you to a physical therapist, and include on the order options to use ultrasound, massage, and hydrotherapy as well as stretching or strengthening exercises as appropriate - give the therapists wide latitude to see what works.    After getting an MRI, if It looks like a nerve problem, ask the doc to refer you to a neurologist that specializes in spinal problems.
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	It's normal, it's called menstrual cramps, there are plenty of things you can do to prevent them in the future or ease your pain now, here are some ideas to help you;     Clary Sage, an essential oill which naturally supports estrogen production and acts on the pituitary gland to help regulate menstrual problems, use neat or diluted in vegetable oil and massage it into your abdomen. Better than painkillers as your body doesn't build up a tolerance which could make cramps progressively worse over time.     Cell Salts, which are a natural mineral that your body needs for basic functioning so if lacking it can cause problems  when you get cramps take them every 5-10 minutes until the pain stops. Wikipedia explains cell salts http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_salts     Heat packs help increase blood flow to the pelvic organs, but cold packs may help too. If heat works for you then try a hot bath with a little lavender oil to help you relax and feel more comfortable.    Try herbs in tea form from a store or supermarket, best fresh but teabags are fine just don't boil as this affects potency of the herb. If not a 'women's blend' try any of these; raspberry leaf, yarrow, lemon balm, black haw, chamomile, red raspberry, wild strawberry, Valerian. Bupleurum (aka xiao yao wan) is a Chinese herbal medicine you take 3-4 tablets 4 times per day for two weeks before your period is due, you can get this from any Chinese herbalist. There are plenty of other herbs to help, try talking to staff in a good herbal store as they will help you. Also try Evening Primrose Oil capsules daily, most health stores and supermarkets stock this as it is a good all-round women's health supplement that helps to regulate hormones. See Sister Zeus http://www.sisterzeus.com     Avooid using tampons as they negatively affect vaginal health in turn affecting menstrual health, when they expand they can also add to bloating or expand into the cervix making cramps worse. Instead try to stick to pads, or if you use tampons switch to menstrual cups or softcups. See tampon health web site http://www.spotsite.org and menstrual cup support http://menstrualcups.org     Yoga is good as it has a lot of gentle stretching and breathing excercises, try the book 'Yoga for a health menstrual cycle' by Linda Sparrowe and Patricia Walden, DVD's or there are a lot of sites about yoga. Try this video with postures that would help you - http://www.videojug.com/film/yoga-postur... Anything that stretches the abdomen is good. Donkey exercise; kneel on all fours with your back parallel to the floor, hump your back up and then down again to the horizontal position. Salaam; kneel, slope your back, lean on your arms and rest your head on the floor, rest and relax in this position. Half-roll; lie on your back, hugging one knee, roll your body to the opposite side and back. Another good excercise is sex or masturbating to orgasm helps as during orgasm a hormone called oxytocin is released that causes uterine contractions, this along with relaxation and improved circulation help to ease cramps.    Acupressure is something a lot of women I know who suffer from extreme cramps go for complimentary treatments such as chiropractors or opt for acupressure or acupuncture. If you cannot afford to see a specialist get a book to teach yourself some basics of acupressure/acupuncture. Some points to stimulate for menstrual cramps are: BL24 (Qihaishu), BL25 (Dachangshu), BL30 (Baihuanshu), BL31 (Shangliao), BL32 (Ciliao), BL34 (Xialiao), CV2 (Qugu), CV6 (Qihai), KI5 (Shuiquan), and KI6 (Zhao Hai). You can find the locations of these points here - http://www.acuxo.com/selections.asp?ques...     Diet, that's a huge factor that can make serious differences but it's bloody complex so if it's something you'd be interested in you'd need to go research yourself. For now get a good balanced diet of nutritious foods rich in essential fatty acids and low in refined sugars, refined carbohydrates and hydrogenated fats. Avoid foods that make you bloated such as salty foods, when bloated drink more water with a little lemon juice as a natural diuretic. Some find dairy and caffeine cause problems  although coffee is good for reducing menstrual flow. Soy should also be avoided as it is notorious for causing problems. Try taking a good multi-vitamin, omega 3 or flaxseed oil (approx. 500Mg 2-4 times a day), B vitamin complex with 100mg of vitamin B6, Magnesium (100mg every 2 hours during menstruation), and vitamin E in d-alpha tocopherol form (50mg 3 times a day). It sounds complex but for a start try a multi-vitamin daily and increase magnesium, calcium and potassium during your periods as these are needed by your body to help uterus lining shed.     Attitude has a big influence, obviously good attitude means a woman is more likely to learn what she needs to better deal with her periods, but moods have influence too  for example if you are stressed your period will be more difficult, so eliminate any stress from your life. If cramps are bad or continue see your doctor, but be careful as many doctors prescribe the pill as a quick-fix, this is a problem because it may cover up an underlying medical problem. You may get given the cheapest pill rather than the most useful, you could spend years trying to find a brand that works, there are multiple side-effects, and after all that it might not even work.

Smile, be happy :)|`|vlCWp7sSaa	There are several names and it's called Mid-Day Crash, afternoon slump or afternoon apathy syndrome.    You're not the only one that gets it! It's both a physical and psychological thing. At noon most people are ready to go home and rest.    Heavy lunch = heavy drowsiness: Instead of eating a heavy lunch that your body will have to break down more aggressively, start with a heavy breakfast, and then split your lunch into two light meals. This will reduce the focus of your body on digestion and keep you attentive to your work. Your lunch should contain protein and dietary fiber from foods such as poultry, lean meat, tuna, seafoods, nuts, and beans.    Get up and take a walk: Its extremely hard to do anything even remotely physically demanding when sleepiness sets in, but you have to will yourself to get up from your chair and wake up. Before you go to class take the stairs or walk around campus to get your blood flowing!    Wash your face: Your body needs outside stimulus to keep its focus during the post-lunch slump. When your face starts to feel numb because of drowsiness, go to the restroom and splash water on your face. Brush your hair, massage your face, or reapply makeup if you want. Once you see yourself looking better, youll also feel better.    A glass of water: Fatigue is sometimes caused by dehydration, which is often exacerbated by drinking too much coffee. Instead of coffee, drink a fresh glass of water to give your body plenty of liquids for the rest of the day. Juicy fruits like watermelon can also rehydrate and fill you up with essential vitamins and fibers. Bring a bottle of water with you to class too.    Meditate for five minutes: Scientists believe that meditation rejuvenates the body. Meditation doesnt merely consist of closing your eyes and bowing your head, since these activities will just lull you to sleep more. Meditation means relaxing yourself and doing some breathing exercises to circulate fresh air into your system. Listen to positive, motivating music. Indiana University as a morning Yoga class that several people I know take to help clear their mind!    Get some rest! When you feel sleepy it means your body wants to rest! Take a nap when you get out of class!|`|AA10338771	You should get plenty of sleep during the night.

h5rP7p95aa	There could be a few reasons why this may occur.  Lets talk about how a drug test works and what are the differences between an instant home drug test and a lab based drug test.    First of all urine drug tests do not test for the drug specifically, but rather they test for the metabolite of the drug.  Meaning it tests for what the drug turned into after it was consumed by an individual.     An instant drug test or screen for THC (Marijuana) tests at a level of 50 ng/ml.  Meaning anything over 50 ng/ml will come back positive and anything below that will be negative.     A lab based test will also screen at 50 ng/ml, but and heres the kicker if the test shows questionable or if its positive the lab will do a confirmation test called GC/SM and this test is 100% accurate. Its so accurate that it will test at a level of 15 ng/ml.     Now back to your home drug test kit. A faint line is counted as a line and it's a negative result.  Now with that being said, if a line is so faint that one can barley see it then its questionable. When a line is so faint that you can barley see it one must say that youre hovering at the cut off level and if you took a lab based test you would probably fail. You need to take another test to see if its still really faint.  Also be aware that urine samples taken during different times off the day will have different concentrations of the drug metabolite. i.e a morning urine sample would have a much higher concentration the a sample taken in then afternoon.    Also check out this website they have a resource page and a blog that discusses this in more detail.

iK3YYRaTaa	I think once your husband gets control of his depression he may start to control his diabetes.    Depression is not generally listed as a complication of diabetes. However, it can be one of the most common and dangerous complications. The rate of depression in diabetics is much higher than in the general population. Diabetics with major depression have a very high rate of recurrent depressive episodes within the following five years. (Lustman et al 1977) A depressed person may not have the energy or motivation to maintain good diabetic management. Depression is frequently associated with unhealthy appetite changes. The suicidal diabetic adolescent has constant access to potentially lethal doses of insulin.   At this point in time, it is well accepted that psychological factors and psychiatric conditions can affect the course of medical illnesses. There is some suggestion that the stress of depression itself may lead to hyperglycemia in diabetics. The interaction between cardiovascular disorders (such as heart attack and high blood pressure) and depression has been extensively studied. Anxiety and depression can also affect other conditions including irritable bowel syndrome, headache and skin diseases. Treatment of anxiety and depression may lead to a better medical prognosis and well as a better quality of life.     For over three hundred years, physicians have suspected an interaction between the emotions and the course of diabetes mellitus. Studies have examined whether stressful events or psychiatric illness might precipitate either Type I (insulin-dependent) or Type II (Non-insulin dependent) diabetes. So far, study results are not conclusive.    Now that we have more accurate methods of measuring glucose control, it has become easier to measure both short-term and long-term effects of emotional factors on blood glucose level. One study found that children judged to have a "Type A" personality structure had an increased blood sugar elevation in response to stress. Children with a calmer disposition had a smaller glucose rise when stressed. (Stabler et al. 1987) A 1997 study suggested that Type I patients with a history of a psychiatric illness might be at increased risk for developing diabetic retinopathy. Those patients with a psychiatric history were found to have a higher average glycosylated hemoglobin. (a measure of long term diabetic control) (Cohen et al. 1997) Children whose relatives made more critical comments had significantly poorer glucose control. Interestingly enough, emotional overinvolvement between family members was not correlated with poor diabetic control. (Koenigsberg et al. 1993) Diabetic adolescents had a higher incidence of suicidal ideation than expected. Those with suicidal ideation took poorer care of themselves. Not living in a two-parent home was associated with poorer long-term diabetes control. (Goldston, et al. 1997)    Recent studies have suggested that effective treatment of depression can improve diabetic control. In a study by Lustman and colleagues, glucose levels were shown to improve as depression lifted. The better the improvement, the better the diabetic control. (Lustman et al. 1997a)    Good luck !|`|Yaxdy8U2aa	i dont know about the itching....cause i dont itch when my blood sugars are high....but honey you gotta try to make him understand how serious this is....i've been living with diabetes for 16 years....and one thing i learned very quickly was how serious this disease is.....and how many complications can happen if i dont take care of myself....so why dont you try to get him to do some research with you on the internet and maybe some of the stories and pictures of people who haven't taken care of themselves will make him take this more serious....hope i helped....good luck....tell your husband to hang in there...he isn't alone.....*hugs*|`|EeTs9DqUaa	The itching can be caused by uncontrolled blood sugars as can the skin infections.  You need to talk to him (not yell, not nag), ask him to make sure his will is up to date and suggest the two of you spend a day preparing his funeral arrangements as his is trying to get there as fast as possible.    If he comes to his senses and wants to start taking care of himself the itching will go away.  He needs to start eating properly, meaning low carb,  eliminating most if not all white carbs, milk, bread, potatoes,rice and pasta and then exercising.  Next is to go to diabetic classes at your local hospital.  Properly controlled type 2 diabetes will not shorten his life span but his current course will!|`|hdtNLIIwaa	Itchy skin can result as a complication from Diabetes.  Diabetes effects all organs of the body, including the skin.    It is essential that you explain to your husband that if he doesn't start taking his disease seriously, he could end up with severe consequences.  He may have a small wound on his foot that can lead to something as serious as leg amputation.  He may go blind.  His kidneys may shut down.  All these things (and many more) are very REAL possibilities that I have personally seen MANY TIMES first hand as a health care professional.    If the itchy skin is what bothers him the most, go on that and convince him to get his health back on that basis.  Controlling his diabetes and taking his doctor's advice will help control his itchy skin and also help work to prevent other serious complications.  Everyday that goes by without taking care of himself, unseen damage is being done, and it's starting to build up and show.    Good luck with this; I hope things turn out well.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Take him on a tour of the Nursing HOmes in your vicinity. Ask him which one you should put him in, which one he prefers! Also go to the mortuary and start making plans for his funereal with him present.     Maybe that will wake him up, but probably not!    Itching is a sign that the skin is getting dryer and flakier and is caused by very high glucose numbers.    You cannot make him take care of himself. It is like trying to get an alcoholic to admit they are and go to AA meetings.    I wish you a lot of love and luck with your hardhead. My grandson's other grandfather is in a bad place for the same things - not taking care of himself. He is in dialysis daily, blind, in a wheel chair due to the continuing loss of bits of his feet. He is barely 50 yrs old!  I am in much better shape as I take this thing seriously and see the doctor every 3 months at minimum and usually once a month for some owee or other! Even a hangnail can cost a finger all the way to the shoulder in diabetics!|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	Lose the sugar & check his blood sugar.  He can create big problems for himself.
mDkUmEUzaa	Mine got slightly infected.  I made some warm water (with loads of salt in - I mean LOADS) and just laid back and soaked a cotton wool ball in it and held it over my belly button for ages.  Just keep doing this and it should clear up.|`|zhk8o514aa	Yes it sounds infected.  Whoever did your piercing should have given you an package (it tells you what to do)  and a cleaning solution...unless you did something stupid and pierced it yourself.|`|RgNGZYJEaa	Your navel piercings is indeed infected. Don't worry though, make sure you clean your piercing thoroughly everyday and you may get a sorta of spot come up on it.. Just squeeze it as it's a build up of soap and other things, puss should come out and it's good once it's out.    I suggest leaving the banana bell in you know for sure EVERYTHING has healed :)    Hope this helps x|`|PZHuNcVxaa	yep that sound like it infected.....Remove your body piercing jewelry and clean it with rubbing alcohol or antibacterial soap if it continues to cause an irritation to your infection. It is best to leave the piercing jewelry out if it seems to be preventing healing, even if it means the piercing may close up......  or if it dont hurt much Wash the area where you have the body piercing infection several times a day with antibacterial TCP(diluted) and warm water. This will help kill the bacteria that is causing the infection to your skin and will help increase blood circulation to this area of the body. If you have had the piercing for at least 48 hours, soak the infected area for up to 20 minutes several times a day to help soothe any pain associated with the infection.|`|fXHGaUEMaa	Definately sounds infected. BEST option is to go to your local tattoo and piercing store and buy a cleanser called "dragon mist" and clean it 4-5 times a day. Otherwise, buy sea salt ( and SEA SALT only) from any drug store, and put it in a shot glass with warm water. Bend over and put it over your belly button and shake it a couple times to get it all cleaned out. Do this 4-5 times a day. Never use polysporin or anything. Promise! Mine got infected HUGE like 5 years ago and this is what I did and within a week or so it was fine. Just give it time :)|`|TudZYPN5aa	Hydrogen peroxide every day should help...     also, if you go to walgreens, they have this really expensive wash called "hibiclens"    it's what doctors use to clean themselves before doing surgery, and i tell ya, it gets rid of infections in ANYTHING    if you use the hibiclens, just wash it like you would wash it in your body, and rinse off.  the last time i checked the hibiclens was 10 dollars, but that's cheaper than a doctor visit any day.|`|VWGU8sejaa	u might need to try takin it out everyday and puttin peroxide or alcohol on it
AA12266052	Dermatophagia (sufferers can be called wolf-biters) is a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder wherein a sufferer compulsively bites their own skin. Sufferers typically bite the skin around the nails, leading to bleeding and discoloration over time. Those who suffer from this often can not stop the biting, and therefore cannot help themselves.|`|jeX5VZAtaa	Heheh I was just doing that as I came across this question.

I would go to a doctor and see about Behavioral treatments. Based in discouraging the habit and replace it with a more constructive habit.

GRRaOvt7aa	The thing about aerobic workouts is that if you run or use the elliptical at a steady pace the body will hold on to fat reserves, although you will definitely gain some muscle and lose fat. To better lose weight I recommend sprinting and then walking, repeat that for as long as you can and work your way up to about a mile. Walk the round parts of a track and sprint the straight parts. If you were really overweight almost anything aerobic would work but it sounds like you just want to get rid of a little excess fat.|`|iYky05uIaa	Spend some time having a look at the link below, iam sure its gonna help you.
HPpdcAtAaa	It actually sounds more like anxiety than depression, which is just as serious.    I did a search for you on anxiety and came up with these sites:  WebMD says "An anxiety disorder is a serious mental illness. For people with anxiety disorders, worry and fear are constant and overwhelming, and can be crippling." and then describes the different types of anxiety.    http://www.webmd.com/anxiety-panic/guide...    this is the rest of the search results:  http://www.sweetsearch.com/search.html?q...

I would suggest that you let someone into your world.  Talk to a friend, relative, or pretty much anyone you feel comfortable with.

If you are a teen then it's really hard to diagnose it. As these depression-like symptoms are uncharacteristic of the teen, disruptive to daily life and normal functioning, leads to negative behaviour that impacts or endangers the interpersonal social and family relationships, consistent low self esteem vented as either aggression and/or withdrawal and feelings of worthlessness and futility,  that lasts more than two weeks and do not seem to dissipate: irrational on-going uneasiness and anxiety, interference with the ability to think clearly, notice and remember details, inability to make any/good decisions, poor performance in school, withdrawal from friends and activities,  inexplicable feelings of despair, guilt, apathy, sadness and hopelessness, lack of enthusiasm, energy or motivation, anger and rage, overreaction to criticism, feelings of being unable to satisfy ideals , poor self-esteem or guilt,  forgetfulness, restlessness and agitation, noticeable and significant changes in eating or sleeping patterns, fatigue,  insomnia, appetite disturbances, substance abuse, problems with authority, suicidal thoughts or actions. Some of these, all or a couple of these symptoms might be present which merits discussing it openly, keeping the channels of communication open, seeking professional help and counsel.|`|3wy5kMU5aa	Im no expert, but that sounds like an anxiety or panic disorder, and I would definately seek help through a local mental health help facility to diagnose it right away.

uHcGn3Yaaa	900 calories is a very extreme number.      You know why you're gaining weight?  Your body is going into survival mode (due to seriously lack of calories) and it is saying "I'm starving, I need to store anything as fat!"      The proper way to lose weight, truly is, diet and exercise.  There is no fast fix.  Diet pills, not eating, and extreme exercise only hurt your body and make it more stressed out.  Be gentle to your body.|`|htBxuF28aa	should loose some but y dont u just eat healthy|`|unpJVzFSaa	Only get on the scale once a week. Pick a day and stick with it.   Eat small snacks all day. Chicken, lean beef, vegi's, fruit, fat free yogurt, rice cakes (I like the carmel ones), try to cut back carbs but still eat some since you need your energy. You won't even feel hungry if you're eating every 2-3 hours.  Start doing exercise at home. Sit-ups, crunches, leg lifts, push-ups. You'll will see results in about 2-3 weeks.|`|A1wN5SHZaa	try substituting all your drinks with water.. its the very least people can do to start getting healthier.. i did it and lost over ten pounds. Sodas have a ridiculus amount of sugar.. and juices arent any better.. so try this.. no fast food.. dont eat enless your stomach is growling, and try just doing 40 sit up every night.. im sure you will see results.|`|01P1hVfWaa	900 is not enough. You should eat at least 1000 to avoid going to starvation mode and storing fat. But i recommend 1200 to 1400 per day. Make sure your calories are coming from a good source, like fruits and veggies. Always eat breakfast! It help you metabolize and will keep you full during the day. Drink 8 to 10 cups of water a day. Also, you should try to do some cardio. You should start to drop weight in a week or so.|`|2QFe7onpaa	Your body is going into starvation mode. You need to eat at least 1200 calories a day so your body doesn't start storing "resources." It sounds like that is what your body is doing.    First, you don't need to lose weight. You are in a healthy range. Look up your BMI. If you don't like how you look, try exercising, eating healthy (there are websites that can help plan healthy meals for you) and toning. This will help you lose a little weight, but you will be gaining muscle and losing fat, so the scale may show an increase. But don't go based on what the numbers say, go based on how you feel.|`|kRQlW5uNaa	U need to eat 6 small meals a day and drink A LOT OF WATER...try to get some more cardio in for better results|`|FHui30aeaa	No, you will get sick though.  You need to eat sensibly, fruit, veggies, high fiber, lean protein, lots of water and if you exercise you will lose weight and be healthy.   Muscle burns more calories than fat.  You need to be toned as well as slim.  Losing weight fast means you will put it back on and more.  You need to change your life style slowly.|`|HQ3aNEk5aa	It's completely impossible to tell. Everybody is different and we all lose weight at different rates. My uncle lost loads in two weeks when he was advised by the doctor, but it took my mum so long to lose hardly any.  I would advise a little more exercise. Since I don't know your age I can't determine if you are tall for your age or normal or short. It all depends. As I said, a little more exercise works wonders. Also, eating HEALTHILY is very important. Stay off the fizzy drinks and crisps, cakes and biccies (however tempting it may be!)  If you're under 14, don't worry too much about weight. It will probably go away after this time.  If not, all isn't lost. Do what I've said and you'll probably get it off.  You could email me with your age if you don't want to put it public, and I'll give you more advice (as long as I have your email adress!) :)      Hope I helped.

YxrJQy9Baa	I have a similar problem... and I'm not a fitness expert... but what I have been trying to do is do little 10 minute workouts whenever I get a chance and trying to add exercise back into my life by walking whenever possible, taking the stairs instead of the elevator, and just picking up the pace in general.  I can't give you exact times... but hopefully this will help.    I know that I took off 20 lbs and increased my energy when I was living in Mexico and had to walk up lots of stairs to get to my house... Just the incidental workout  of walking to work and taking the stairs changed my fitness level greatly.|`|EMNwWAuvaa	Jon, you didn't state what you really wanted to get from the workouts?  The energy aspect is going to happen no matter what type of program you do.  Since you are not interested in losing weight how about more muscle mass.  That would pep up your energy level, make you feel better about things mostly yourself, workout any pent up aggression from your busy life, help in controlling weight, and if done in a circuit could be done in thirty to forty-five minutes at home or at a gym.  You should be used to lifting from crew.  Maintaining the same program would be easy as you are all ready familiar with it.  Start there and see where it leads you.  If that is not of interest try Pilate's or yoga as they will both help you with exercise and stress of the life schedule that you have.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	What's enough to get by in a week? 3 or 4 half-hour brisk walks during the week can really help.|`|SGlb0EP8aa	You should aim for 3 or 4 sessions of cardio for at least 30 minutes each session.

EtCRnDJMaa	I just bought a new book ny Jillian Michaels called "Making The Cut"    She has a BMR Formula in it.  -Basel Metabolic Rate-    Your BMR is the number of calories that your body needs to function at the most basic level---it's what you'd burn if you sat on the couch all day and didn't move a muscle.  You will also have plenty of energy for your workouts while creating a caloric deficit through your daily activities & exercise.  So here it is-    BMR = 655 + (4.35 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)|`|dUj7rP2haa	10 lbs in two weeks may well be a unrealistic goal.

8i6mJJf8aa	Prescription Valtrex works great but you need to see a doctor  and it is spendy.   I take 2 pills as soon as I notice it coming and maybe 2-4 more and they are hardly noticeable.  Also the aches and pain are minimized.      I put ice on it right away and it seems to help.

LMRaSXFeaa	why dont you wax instead?|`|ABOvm38Caa	If you are willing to pay the money you can get a brazilian wax, so you won't have any bumps.

I know the name sounds funny but it does work.  Good luck!|`|vI6Dikavaa	I am an esthetician, and i do a whole lot of waxing and a lot of women ask me the same thing. The best answer i can give you is there is a product call "No Bumps" and if you use it 3 days before and a day after shaving it helps prevent with ingrown bumps razor burn and all.     Another thing is you might be getting these pimple looking bumbs because the razor you are using is way to dull. Never use a razor more than once on your area down there especially if you have coarse hair. It dulls after one shave which can cause ingrown hairs for sure, try using a mens razor like the orange fusion ones with 5 blades and that will help with smoothness also.     good-luck, if you have any other questions feel free to email me!

JxCtNXn3aa	The best way would be to take a bath until you don't have to get your foot treated ever again. Just lie down in the bathtub and keep your foot out of the water. You could put a sock on it and not put your foot in the water while bathing but the only problem is that you won't be able to wash your hair!  You could try getting an old waterproof jacket, ripping it up and cutting it to a reasonable size that'll fit around your foot. You could then wear that as a kind of sock and use a rubber band to keep it round your foot. Or, you could actually use your waterproof jacket material and sew it into a sock if that's possible and then use the rubber band to keep it on. That way you could have a shower and be able to wash your hair and body without getting your foot wet. I'm not sure if any of that helped seeing as they may sound stupid but I help it will eventually work!  Good luck! (and if you choose this as a best answer please try out my answer before picking it so I know if it works!) :D|`|d9cB8yN8aa	You can get one of those big garbage bags, then put your foot in it.

I would put a towel down on the outside where you foot is cause some water will get out of the tub.     To be extra carefully maybe put a sack on your foot while you are standing half in and half out.     Another option is to go to a medical supply store and get what I can only describe a "foot Condom"     One of my friends broke her femur when we where in HS. She had what we called her "leg condom" on. A long bootie that had a rubber part at the top to seal the plastic bottie around her hip.     She had this "leg condom" on so she could still water ski. Her cast never got wet.|`|AA11884446	Are you able to take a bath instead of a shower?

They all had a "permanent retainer" on their bottom teeth that stayed in until they were 21-22.|`|MdSU0s8Saa	i haven't got it yet but i no i'm having it for a year  there are different retainers- permenant and non-permenant (removable)|`|tP0p7bGQaa	wore mine a year @ night only.|`|gUMonqNTaa	you wear it for the rest of your life unless you want them to go crooked.. and when to wear it that your othodontist should have told you that...|`|8cDd70dSaa	A year and a half, only at night

UHv71AN5aa	I have back problems, but it is my own fault I would suggest ALWAYS use proper lifting (using your legs), keeping your core strong, there are many core type exercises you can find online. Stretching your muscles, i.e. legs, hamstrings, thighs. It has helped me so far. Also if you are able; a good workout is very beneficial too to maintain your proper weight along with a healthy diet. A big belly will add stress to your back to compensate.   So, Proper lifting, diet, stretching, exercise, & proper posture. Keep those in mind and it may help you in the long run!

Be sure to stay away from any kind of processed meat or junk food the preservatives in them can make the headache worse. If your headache is still bad after an hour you can take some tylenol and that should clear it up.
73nTYgdraa	No, the only thing that could harm the growth plates in your body would be to actually drop the weights on you.  If you start with lower weights and work on the technique you shouldn't be able to hurt yourself.  That's also a very important point in bodybuilding. That is to use proper technique and work your muscles to hypertrophy by doing plenty of repetitions. You can't lift a weight a lot if you have a lot much weight on it.|`|E64juLwJaa	No it will not stunt your growth at all.  Your growth is determined by your genes and not by your activities  Planets.
7880ad6cbd1decea960f47cab9e65dadaa	Usually people who get diverticulitis are 40 or older and the pain is usually on the lower "left" side of the abdomen, though it can be anywhere.  Diverticulitis may on a rare occasion occur in a younger person, but that wouldn't be my first diagnosis for a 19 yr old especially with pain on the lower "right" side of your abdomen.  There are other problems that could have this symptom:  Appendicitis is one that is mentioned above, constipation could also cause abdominal pain.   From your avatar I will surmise that you are female so it could have something to do with your menses or ovaries.  My suggestion would be to be checked out by your physician.  If the pain is severe go to a walk in clinic and be checked.   If it is appendicitis it could lead to more serious problems; it could rupture.  You need a more thorough examination to really know what is causing the pain, and possibly some blood tests.    Below is a website to learn more about diverticulitis if your interested.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	it is very rare for someone your age to get diverticulitis, I would suspect appendicitis first.

You can die, not just go blind.  At the emergency room tell them about your WHOLE story, not just the eye, be honest and tell them why you have the seeing starts.  They will at the very least get your fluids back up and check all your vitals because you have no idea what damage you are doing.  You can actually stop your heart from not getting enough of certain nutrients, like a lack of potasium you can get heart failure.  They may be able to lead you to somewhere that can help IMMEDIATELY, there is no reason to wait.  If you don't have insurance they cannot refuse you help at the ER.|`|baQpo0kdaa	Yes, sweetheart you should be worried about a lot of things. you  should really get help immediately.

Then, I have only one other suggestion, and that is to apply and pay for Aflac.

You really shouldn't go below 1500 calories because you will have all sorts of problems (headaches, weakness, fainting, etc.) because your body simply will not have energy. Additionally when you eat such a small amount of calories your body goes into starvation mode and slows down its metabolism a significant amount, which would go against you loosing weight. Additionally a healthy weight lose is 2-3 lbs a week. The best way to loose weight is to eat the minimum 1500-1600 calories and exercise more to reduce the overall calorie intake for the day.|`|ObKFA5djaa	eat 1200 and eat healthey and you can lose 12-15 lbs|`|zZiWxkiGaa	It is possible|`|OBwqjS8maa	Yeah, that seems like a really bad idea. 850 calories is not NEARLY enough.

It is quite possible to lose the weight this way, but you dont need to. For your height, your weight is fine. If you want to lose weight 5 lbs would be enough. I am 2 inches shorter than you and weigh 140 lbs, I would like to lose 10 lbs, but any more and I would not look healthy. If you really want to be healthy about it, then cut your calories to about 1200 a day and run instead of walk (if possible). You may even gain weight because muscle weighs more than fat, so you would lose inches not lbs. Work on toning your muscles and your muscles will burn the fat for you.

The minute you consume a normal 1500-2000 calories in a day, your body will store and gain.  Try to increase your calories to at least 1200 (which is still low.)

The virus would have been in his body all of his life and if he is tired, stressed, run down, ill etc then he will occasionaly be prone to getting them.    If you have never had a coldsore in your life then you can kiss him and you wont get one on your mouth as you do not hold the herpus virus.    However if you have never had one on your mouth and do not have the herpes simplus virus (the coldsores on your mouth) then this means that you will be able to get the genital herpes virus (down below).   This is because one person can only have one of these viruses so if you have ever had a coldsore on your mouth you will never be able to get them on your genitals, but if you have never had them on your mouth you can pick them up on your genitals if he goes down on you (hope that makes sense).    if you have a coldsore on your mouth then yes it does mean you have herpes, but not genital herpes|`|zeZtFbGjaa	If a person has a herpes sore on the lips, for example, he or she can spread herpes to the lips of another person through kissing. Infection can also be spread from the lips to the genitals during oral sex. This is why so many cases of genital herpes are caused today by herpes type 1.    If one has a herpes sore on the genitals, coitus or other unprotected sexual activity gives the virus a chance to spread, resulting most often in genital-to-genital transmission.     But it depends on the person and their natural defences|`|AA12266052	Herpes simplex virus infection spread by skin to skin contact. Genital herpes (HSV2) can also cause cold sores through oral sex. If your boyfriend who has no visible sores, kisses you, then you will get cold sores. Cold sores (HSV1) can also cause genital herpes if he does oral sex on others.  Viral STDs have no cure. Topical ointment Zovirax may heal active herpes lesions.  You can take steps to guard against cold sores, to prevent spreading them to other parts of your body or to avoid passing them along to another person. Cold sore prevention involves the following:      * Avoid kissing and skin contact with people while blisters are present. The virus can spread easily as long as there are moist secretions from your blisters. In persons with depressed immune systems, the virus can be spread even after the skin appears to be healed.      * Avoid sharing items. Utensils, towels, lip balm and other items can spread the virus when blisters are present.      * Keep your hands clean. Wash your hands carefully before touching another person when you have a cold sore.      * Be careful about touching other parts of your body. Your eyes and genital area may be particularly susceptible to spread of the virus.      * Avoid triggers. If possible try to avoid or prevent conditions that stress your body, such as getting a cold or the flu, not getting enough sleep or staying in the sun for long periods of time without applying sunblock.      * Use sunblock. Apply sunblock to your lips and face before prolonged exposure to the sun  during both the winter and the summer  to help prevent cold sores.|`|AfdyNi9Raa	The virus which causes coldsores is called herpes simplex.  If you have true cold sores then yes, you have herpes.  The condition in infectious when is an open sore, the weeping fluid has virus particles in it.  Direct contact with the sore or fluid is required for transmission.      The virus can lie virus for months or years and re occur when the sufferer is run down or ill.  He could have caught from his grandma.      Wait till the sore is fully healed before kissing or other sexual contact.  Genital herpes is the same virus so it is to be avoided.    He may have severely chapped lips which is not herpes.|`|AA11321694	its caused by virus and also very contagious in nature so now you knew whats good for you?  Cold sores are caused by a viral infection that attacks the skin and nervous system. Cold sores -- also called fever blisters -- are a painful infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). which is transmitted by such forms of contact as kissing an infected person or sharing eating utensils, towels, or razors. Genital herpes is usually caused by herpes simplex virus Type 2. A person with a cold sore who performs oral sex on another person can give that person genital lesions with HSV-1.  Sores may develop as late as 20 days after exposure to the virus. Once the virus enters your body, it may emerge years later at or near the original site of entry. About two days before an attack you may experience itching or sensitivity at the site. The virus may be triggered by certain foods, stress, fever, colds, allergies, sunburn, and menstruation.  Without proper hygiene, this virus can be very contagious. This is why it is important if you have cold sores to wash your hands often, especially after you may have touched your face. Do not share cups or utensils with another person.|`|xvbVjP3Aaa	Hi herpes is viral infection within your body usually lies dornment until something triggers it off, it can be anything from a germ in a chipped cup to eating oranges (my friend got coldsores everytime she ate oranges) even having the cold or being out in the cold or if ur a bit run down. Yes they are very contagatious and can spread so don't pick them alway wash your hands after touching them and wouldn't risk the last part of your question. Herpes is the latin name for them they are also linked to chicken pox (herpes zolster) so just be carefull for a few days.|`|UZxeBrxQaa	"Hana" is not a nurse.  Her explanation shows a complete lack of knowledge of herpes simplex or herpes zoster, commonly known as herpes I and herpes II.  Hana, don't share misinformation like this.  It can affect this young lady for the rest of her life.  If you don't know the answer, stay quiet and cause no harm.    Herpes I and herpes II are both viruses and are contagious when an attack is flaring up.    Genital herpes can be caught if you are exposed to herpes simplex or zoster during a flareup.    You are not born with the virus.  It is passed on to you from an infected person.    Herpes I or herpes II can be infected at any mucus membrane.  You can get genital herpes from someone with a cold sore.|`|VBMOuIuxaa	more than likely your bf has had cold sores in the past and it is just a flair up. it is very unlikely that he has been kissing another girl with a cold sore.     secondly, if you have never had a cold sore before and he kisses, he can pass on the HSV I (herpes simplex I) virus to you. it does not guarantee you will get a cold sore, but you will have the virus for the rest of your life and have the possibility of getting one. they are very common and a lot of people have the virus but never get cold sores. others, like your bf, have the virus and occassionally get a cold sore. by the way, HSV I refers ONLY to oral herpes, NOT genital. just because your bf has a cold sore does NOT guarantee he has genital herpes.       thirdly, cold sores = HSV I = herpes. BUT like i just said above, HSV I is a herpes virus, but only in the mouth. HSV II is GENITAL herpes (which the person could have cold sores on the mouth too)    Lastly, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, DO NOT, i mean it, DO NOT let him go down on you when he hass a cold sore. the HSV I virus can easily become HSV II when it comes into contact with genitals. so, if he goes down on you, he WILL give you genital herpes (which is NOT curable) and then if you both have sex, he will get genital herpes too.  NOT FUN.    and one final thought, your bf, with a cold sore, should never touch his cold sore and then touch his genitals without washing his hands first. he can self-inoculate and give himself genital herpes, which will again be spread to you if you have sex with him. herpes is nasty nasty painful stuff. imagine having a cold sore between your legs. i have heard that it burns when urine touches the genital herpe and that is excruciating. so please play it safe.
Bwosoy7jaa	The pains in your shoulders and back, was the gas used to pump up your stomach during surgery. I had the same pain for a few days. Rest is the only way to help it heal. And your diet as well. You can only make it worse by over doing it and trying to work or something just give it a couple of weeks. Also now that u dont have a gallbladder you should start taking bile salts and probiotics to help out you stomach and your liver. I also find that when i eat fast food or overdo it with unhealthy foods and drinks, my stomach gets sore. so take it easy on your liver now that your gallbladder is out your liver has more work to do.|`|yPTUG6uNaa	Consult your doc again|`|EMbaak9waa	Panadine Forte and it will take about a week or two for you to recover.

H0aiDO9Paa	See your health care provider as soon as possible (Neurologist or rheumatologist). Fibromyalgia, also known as fibrositis or fibromyositis, refers to a disorder of unknown cause that is characterized by recurrent pain in the joints, muscles, or tendons. Often small, specific area called "trigger points" are tender to the touch. Physical strain and cold or damp weather can make the disorder worse. Frequently, the pain is associated with other symptoms, such as insomnia, fatigue, or anxiety. Laboratory tests are usually normal. There are several treatments: physical therapy, warm or cold compresses, anti-inflammatory medication and sometimes an anesthetic or cortisone injected directly into the trigger points. The symptoms can wax and wane over many years. And good luck.|`|f180924fa608a1843cfd44f843639824aa	I have fibromyalgia and, from what you describe, it seems to me that you are also suffering from this disease.

5TM9P8tsaa	*The stomach flu is going around big time. Our ER has been packed full with people with the stomach flu. You either need to see a doctor or go to ER and get a script for phenergan. This will help with the nausea and vomiting. With the stomach flu you can have anything you can see threw. No cheese crackers and no solid food. You need to give your stomach a break and have no food on it. The only exception is plain jello-nothing in the jello, no fruit or anything in the jello. My whole house hold has had it. It lasted a few days only but then I know what to do. If you keep eating you will never get over it. Remember only things you can see threw. Get some chicken bouillon and make yourself some chicken broth out of it. Get well soon.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	It won't hurt to see a doctor but i am not sure what he can do. You may just have to wait it out.

You may have some fluid in your ear or an inner ear infection, which will make you feel this way.  Try taking a mixture of 1/2 alcohol and 1/2 cider vinegar and put some into your ear (don't get it in your eyes). Let it sit for a few minutes and drain. The alcohol will dry out any fluid and help to clear any infection that may trying to get started.  The vinegar acts as a natural skin softener. If that doesn't work, see a doctor, you might already have a full blown infection and need an antibiotic.  There is a procedure used by physical therapists who have equilibrium problems. This may sound funny but they call it "getting your rocks fixed". It has something to do with the inner ear and the bones in it. My dad had it done because he used to get dizzy like you're describing and he hasn't had one of those spells yet. Take it easy for a while and rest. I bet when you are still and in a reclining position it helps some.  You said in another post that you were not pregnant, so that's why I think it is probably due to an inner ear problem. Good Luck and hope you feel better soon.
5TM9P8tsaa	*I don't think it is carpal tunnel. I had CTS in both hands for ten years before opting for surgery. CTS will wake you up out of a sound sleep because you wrist went to sleep and you feel pins and needles. Mine woke me up every hour on the hour. I tried the wrist restraints for a while but I got no releave from them. I went to an ortho who injected them. I stayed with the injections for almost 5 years before getting the surgery. You need to find an orthopedic doctor and make an appointment. Not all doctors are created equal, and not all doctors are smart. I think you found this out to be true. CTS will not show up on any xrays, scans etc. Get to an ortho and all your problems will be solved.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	Sound like CTS so rest has to be considered. You are overusing your wrists and the tendons are being trapped by swollen carpal tunnels. I think maybe a different doctor such as an orthopedist should be consulted because motrin does not seem to me to be an affective treatment. That is just my opinion.|`|AA11131134	CTS is generally associated with long term use.  Your issue is more an overuse.  Think of a person running: if a person, even in good shape, runs too many days in a row he/she will end up getting sore.  You need to cut back on your activity & just give those wrists a rest.  You obviously can't cut out writing since you have school, but you can ease up on the rest.  Instead of texting, actually give those friends a call or better yet, hang out with them.  Ditch the PS2 for a few days and get outside for some exercise.  Everything in moderation, Bud!|`|yPTUG6uNaa	Consult a general physician|`|z0JIf6qqaa	omg! I'd get a second opinion, like today.

Jdpip6Dxaa	Salvia dorrii,also known as tobacco sage, Dorr's sage, or mint sage is a plant in the genus Salvia, commonly called the sages, in the family Lamiaceae. It is sometimes called purple sage, a name that it shares with S. leucophylla. Plants grow as an evergreen shrub with extremely woody bases, in dry, well draining soils. It is native to mountain areas in the western United States and northwestern Arizona, found mainly in the Great Basin Range habitat and southward to the Mojave desert. Some large native populations of this species exist in the Aquarius Plateau region of Southern Utah.

sJy8zGNhaa	i started weight training at 15. you might be ready for weight / resistance training, but i think you should consult your doctor first but if you decide to go ahead with it, start with using the machines instead of free weights to avoid joint injury until your muscles learn the motion. also take a class or read about training because doing it wrong can really injure you. pilates type exercise also strengthens your muscles a lot, it is an alternative|`|zu0W6hCTaa	dont lift weights just yet cuz ur still have much to grow. use exercises that utilize ur body weight: push ups, dips, sit ups, pull ups, lunges|`|LG200P3Xaa	Youve probably heard this many times before from various sources. Bodybuilding stunts your growth!. This specifically applies to teenagers more than any other age group because it is in those ages that growth takes place. Well, the truth is    WEIGHTLIFTING DOES NOT STUNT YOUR GROWTH!    Thats right, you heard me (or read) correctly, weight lifting does not stunt your growth. Famous sports stars including Shaquille ONeal, David Robinson, Karl Malone, Michael Vick all started weight lifting in their early teen years and all have grown to be taller than 6 feet tall. Arnold Schwarzenegger himself admits that he started weight lifting at a young age and has grown to be 6 2. Lou Ferrigno (The Incredible Hulk) started working out at the age of 14 at the height of 5 9 and grew to a height of 6 5 - taller than anyone in his family! Now unless you class 6 feet as short, there is enough proof on TV to say that weight lifting does not stunt your growth. I started weight lifting at the age of 14 and I am now 6 tall!    The compression forces on the legs and spine produced by what are classed as normal activities such as running and jumping are upto 5 times the bodyweight and it is unlikely that any liftable weight will be able to match this.    There is no scientific proof to say that weight lifting will stunt your growth. In fact, books such as the Russian School of Height suggest that weight lifting promotes growth. Recent surveys and studies show that weight lifting actually has positive effects on growth.    The only thing that can be dangerous when it comes to weight lifting is incorrect technique and form. This can lead to injuries but this is the same for any other activity. With correct technique and form, the risk of incurring injuries is very low.    I hope this clears up the misconception that weight lifting stunts your growth.|`|837xgMwLaa	Push ups ;)|`|iHA7UR5naa	no mate wait till u hit puberty where your body will grow and voice breaks dont want to mess up your growth..... i started around 15-16 once i had took my stretch
3r2YKP0naa	You are about the same height and weight as my wife. She has found that both work BUT to lose and maintain her goal weight she would either have to do 20-30 minutes of high intensity working out(jogging, taebow,elliptical machine) 4 or 5 days a week or do 60-90 minutes of low intensity working out(walking, stationary bike) 4 or 5 days a week. She would usually alternate low and high intensity workouts to avoid getting burned out with the high intensity workouts. She lost about 15 pounds before we got married and it has worked for her since then(over a year now).|`|8hIUOajLaa	From my experience, high intensity combined with a weight/resistance program is the best way to go.|`|sJy8zGNhaa	warm up then do this routine:  1 minute 30 seconds moderate pace  30 seconds of the highest intensity you are able to do  1 minute 30 seconds moderate pace  30 seconds of the highest intensity you are able to do  repeat as long as you can  this is what hollywood trainers have their clients do  weight training is also really important, each pound of muscle you build burns 40-55 calories per hour while you are resting

bFPjiwKpaa	He could have genital warts. They are highly contagious. There is a huge risk of getting the infection from having unprotected sexual contact with someone. She could get vaginal warts from him. I would have him get to a doctor immediately and see what they are. If they are red in color, or look like a type of infection then get it checked.     It could also just be some bump or scar tissue from his circumcision. If the bumps are at the base of the head of the penis, then it could be scar tissue. If they have been there for years, then it probably something his penis just has. If the bumps are on the head itself, it might be something else.     Better safe then sorry.|`|qIF8Mmyuaa	It may be herpes. You may ask them to go to doctors.|`|hPIUa586aa	Genital warts are caused by the HPV virus. They are very contagious.

There are over 700 viruses that cause cold-like symptoms. The sinus infection for which you got the antibiotic was not caused by a virus, but by bacteria. You can't kill viruses with antibiotics, and they don't protect you from virus infections. You had a bacterial infection in the sinuses first, then a virus that caused the cold.

Good luck|`|EZt7ZHIiaa	It is not uncommon for a person to be traumatized and go through an extented period of grief after the death of a loved one such as your father.  However, if you have never been able to grieve properly or have kept your emotions inside throughout this time, it is very easy for these emotions to boil over and start affecting your life in the ways in which you described.  Depending on the severity of your anxiety, there are a number of ways to go about resolving it.  Many times, just talking out your problems with someone you trust can go a long way to unburdening yourself of these fears and worries.  Having someone to confide in and who knows the way you are feeling can have a huge impact in your ability to cope.  If this doesn't help or is not possible/practical, I would suggest that you meet with a counselor or a therapist in order to gain some skills that will allow you to cope with these fears.  I am a therapist and provide professional online counseling ,and have a lot of experience dealing with this type of grief and the fears that accompany it.  However most professional therapists should also be able to help you, if you find someone you would feel comfortable working with, that is what is most important.  Good luck to you.    Ryan|`|e640e5fc04f1c4da3326c5429e707bdcaa	Stop fighting and allow yourself the chance to grieve, You have just gone through a huge life transistion in giving birth. It has taken a lot of your energy, yet that baby can revive energy. If you are stuck in resisting your natural spirtual, physical and mental efforts to recover and regain balance, then you will get post-partuum depression. You will also get post partuum depression to some degree because it has been extra trying and your chemical and hormones are trying to stabilize. So you need to get support in order to nuture yourself so you can nuture your baby.   Secondly, when we experience a parent dying, it is one of the most traumatic events of our lifes. In your case you will be going through a whole range of emotions and it is perfectly normal when grieving to bring up past wounds. It is healthy because with the perspective you have gained insight and wisedom and now can heal them at an ever more deeper level.   There are many, many books on the subject, However I suggest you join a grief group, because it will give you commeradery and a time away from your home, and your baby. I also suggest a play group for mothers, and perhaps enrollment in a co-op in a few months. Jusst getting out will really help both you and your child, {ymca's are excellent because you can get a family membership and start an exercise class}  If you can you might want to look into a community counselling service, they usually provide  a sliding scale and this could be easy to manage financially. Also, you can try VON, telecare, relatives etc. in order to get support.   You might want to try vitamin D about 2000 ui's and look into vitamins to help you heal...they can really make a difference.  I went through the same thing...it is really tough, but it does get easier.|`|P9oP8CS9aa	Seek therapy, breavement counseling and post partum depression.

AA12266052	Cushing syndrome is a disease that occurs when your body produces too much of the hormone cortisol (an adrenal cortical hormone). It may also occur if you take too much cortisol or other steroid hormones.  Cushings disease is a condition in which the pituitary gland releases too much adrenocorticotropic hormone (ATCH). The pituitary gland is an organ of the endocrine system. Cushing's disease is a form of Cushing syndrome.  Cushing syndrome due to adrenal tumor is an endocrine system disorder that occurs when there is a tumor of the adrenal gland releasing excess amounts of the hormone cortisol.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have  to work double on them. The best approach is this:  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal  weight, lower for overweight).  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT  ALL. With the dumbbells you will see it in a week.|`|MvQui0rvaa	eat healthy.  exercise.  do it for more than a day.|`|l1QzfK8uaa	Do crunches every second you get of the day. It worked for me. Cario will not shed the fat. This is a huge myth. It helps some. Weight lifting takes up fat by creating muscle therefore muscle will burn fat the more muscle the more energy your body needs. Crunches I mean every time you are bored down time ETC. Do them. You will see results within 2 months.|`|iYky05uIaa	Check the link and you should be getting a flat stomach..|`|xqZCfTQLaa	well if you want a perfecto, slim, flat stomach. You can try this easy tip to solve your problem. Try doing push ups on the stairs put your hands on the top stair your basically in the same posistion when you do regular push ups. Do 30 of them, in between the exercise you might want to rest a bit keeping from quiting and exhausting. Do this 2 times a day for 2 whole weeks. Good luck:]
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|FLLVtAdEaa	Exercise and burn more calories than you consume.|`|1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	Exercise.

Dont become obsessed at 13 - i did and it was worst thing i ever done!!|`|k4IvZieHaa	Don't eat less. You should still eat, but just stop when you are full.  Eat several small, well-balanced (some carbs, some protein, some fruit) meals throughout the course of the day.  What you need to do is excercise every day, but don't make it a chore. Maybe take a class in whatever intrests or play tennis or volleyball or go for a short run. Or, you could put on some loud danceable music and dance as fast as you can.  Also, if you have a week, you could try going on a health food binge, which means you could test your own will to lose weight and not eat unhealthy foods all week! It would be kind of fun to see if you could do it, even if you only do it for a week. And if you accomplish it, you'll feel better about yourself and will be able to eat junk food less and less afterwards.  I hope this helps.  Good luck!
il9Tdmchaa	Yes you can get copies of your health records. If you let them know what they are for they may even send them in for you.|`|goP5E0Kxaa	I think that is a question for your current doctor .|`|3fd2288554aaf55a30c81ff30a54bba2aa	You make an appointment to go look at them, and someone has to be there to make sure you are not altering your record. A staff person may go thru your mental health part of your record first and pull out anything the psychiatrist doesn't want you to see, but that is supposed to be an unusual thing to do (If they think it will make you a danger to self or others if you were to see it. Like say you're a violent person, and your spouse called in to say you were having problems again and that was put in your chart, maybe they would pull that out).  If you see a few things you want copies of, they will usually give you a few copies (say up to 10 pages, depends on the place) for free, after that it is like $2 or $3 a page, so it can add up. Better just to bring a notebook & take notes, and bring some post it notes to mark the pages you really do need a copy of.  You can only see the records from the office you are at - not transferred records from other offices or hospitals.  To transfer your records to social security or another doctor, then that is free.  Some people get away with going to medical records and asking for a copy to hand-carry to the next doctor, so that's worth a try if you need hard copy.    There is a book called "social security disability" published by nolo press that is very good.  It is a group of self-help lawyers. Even if you have a lawyer, you should read this book.  Go to nolo.com and order one, or get it at the library.    All the best to you!|`|3wy5kMU5aa	yup, but it will cost you. contact your diagnosing physicians, you will never be able to get any further in you disability purposes without having medical proof.|`|RVbxTmLaaa	Yes you can, but you have to fill out a release for medical records, some Dr offices charge a small fee for these.

I've used it before. It worked well in the beginning but then it started to not be as effective but every person is different! Keep that in mind. In my case, i just ended up going to a dermatologist.

Give the routine long enough , ussually it can kick in from 2 - 8 weeks so be patient , makeup that dosent block pores and let your skin breath .You sound really healthy and remeber spots are caused by stress aswell and hormones so you could be eating healthy but still get them.

Just try not to worry about it I'm sure that things will turn out just fine. There could be any number of reasons for why it came back abnormal!|`|rT7BDLpxaa	Yes, in most cases it's, it's a vaginal infection or inflamation of the cervix.  I have had three; the results were benign in two and the third had a small amount of pre-cancerous cells which the gyn removed during the procedure.  I have regular check-ups and have been "clean" for a number of years.  You'll be in either twilight sleep or under general anethesia so you won't feel a thing.      You'll be in my thoughts!|`|rDoI0MIraa	Yep been there done that! Its not that bad don't worry, just a bit embarrassing, i had to have a colposcopy too as they found abnormal cells when i had a pap smear. They just look at them in more detail with a camera that you can see on the screen too if you want! Then i had them burnt away, then a follow up smear 6 months later and everything had cleared up. Now i need a smear every year instead of every 3 years, just to be sure they don't return. Another downside is they advise you not to have sex for 4-6 weeks after :(.

Many transsexuals do not elect to have gender-changing surgery so they retain the penises they were born with. As for why they choose to keep them, that is a matter of personal choice and preference for each transsexual. It does not  change the fact that they emotionally feel completely like women, although they have a penis.    One of the results that has come out of research is that those transsexuals who elect to have their penises removed feel trapped in their male bodies. Many of them feel very depressed or even suidicidal because of the presence of their penis. But these only represent a part of the transsexual community. Others, simply are fine and happy to keep their penis.|`|X6aYVpU3aa	You mean woman who got their penis, right?

The exact cause of GAD is not fully known, but a number of factors -- including genetics, brain chemistry and environmental stresses -- appear to contribute to its development.        * Genetics: Some research suggests that family history plays a part in increasing the likelihood that a person will develop GAD. This means that the tendency to develop GAD may be passed on in families.      * Brain chemistry: GAD has been associated with abnormal levels of certain neurotransmitters in the brain. Neurotransmitters are special chemical messengers that help move information from nerve cell to nerve cell. If the neurotransmitters are out of balance, messages cannot get through the brain properly. This can alter the way the brain reacts in certain situations, leading to anxiety.      * Environmental factors: Trauma and stressful events, such as abuse, the death of a loved one, divorce, changing jobs or schools, may lead to GAD. GAD also may become worse during periods of stress. The use of and withdrawal from addictive substances, including alcohol, caffeine and nicotine, can also worsen anxiety."

pvYy6iTSaa	jeanettemoreno83 -  Simply follow the nurse's suggestion and write in or type "NEGATIVE".  say nothing more, but carry the nurse's phone number with you so that IF anyone questions you, ask them to phone the nurse or ask for an opportunity for you to call the nurse to send you a copy of the negative report on a simple doctor's prescription form.  The NEGATIVE reading usually comes from a small stick in the forearm skin; it doesn't matter which arm.  A negative normally means that your child has not been exposed to any significant tuberculosis bacteria which are so common and harmless 99% of the time.
OBwqjS8maa	Love your avatar. Doug rocks! If you're using Weight Watchers online, you can change your daily points target in the admin settings.    Also, a friendly tip...I lost 15 pounds on Weight Watchers and I always ate my daily points target, my Weekly Points Allowance, AND my activity points. I lost between 1 and 2 pounds every week, which is in the healthy range. I found that the trip was to vary my points intake from one day to the next. For example, one day I might eat 35 points and the next I'd eat 22. Good luck!|`|fkbJ081Maa	I don't know the exact weight watchers method but I do know that the points represent a certain number of calories. The reason you start at a higher points in take is because as you lose weight you need fewer calories. Don't lower your points until you reach your weight loss target as this ensures weight loss momentum- or your weight loss will plateau and you won't lose anything.     My sister joined a slimming club a few years ago and became obsessive. She lowered he calorie intake ridiculously thinking that she would lose weight and instead she was only eating egg whites and non root vegetables, exercising everyday for ridiculous times and initially she lost a lot of weight went to a size 14 but after that she didn't lose anything for years. Her body went into starvation mode and held on to all fat and every christmas or birthday when she ate normally (like a bird compared to the rest of us) she would put on loads of weight as her body wasn't used to having normal calories. She is now eating normally with good oils etc and doing strength and weight training and losing weight consistently.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	You could.
NwIwQoKyaa	I know somebody who had the same problem. Eczema is usually caused by an allergy of some sort, and can be worsened by stress. Myself, I haven't had eczema in years, but I did have it as a teenager. My friend did also, but he was fine until recently after he moved and had a greatly increased stressload. Lack of moisture can also be a big factor; one thing that helped reduce my friend's symptoms drastically before he saw the dermatologist was Aveeno Skin Relief Moisturizing Lotion with oat essence and natural shea butter. I went recently to the emergency room with a mysterious allergic reaction, so allergies have been on my mind a lot lately.    The typical methods of discovering an allergy are a blood test like I had (but only because I'd just had a serious reaction and my blood could have antibodies in it), patches with chemicals set on the back for about five days (my friend had this; he said he wasn't allowed to shower during the time or do strenuous physical activity), and a prick/tine test (I had this after my blood test was inconclusive.) The dermatologist set 20 dots of solution, ten on each arm by a number, and then pricked me with 20 individual tines (hurts quite a bit less than a blood test, and after it's over there's no lingering pain or bruises, but during those 20 minutes the parts I was reacting to itched like hell!) This way it was explained how I could've had three different types of reaction at the same time; the other doctors I'd seen were mystified as to what could've caused so much all at once, but the dermatologist really knew her stuff and she had predicted my test results just from what we told her. Sure enough, the solution I had the worst reaction to was precisely what she'd thought.    My friend's reaction turned out to be caused by an ingredient in nearly every soap and shampoo out there. The best thing your boyfriend could do is go to a dermatologist to get a nice conclusive result and advice, but if you can't get him to do that, then you might want to switch to natural forms of soap--no sodium something sulfates or parabens or any of that crazy stuff. Carefully read the ingredients lists, and if you can't find anything at a health store that is made of natural soaps like castile and doesn't contain detergents, check online for methods like baking soda/apple cider vinegar rinses that you can make yourself with everyday ingredients. This can save you a lot of money and actually is better for your body in the long run, but keep in mind that it takes a period of adjustment as your body realizes it no longer has to overproduce its natural oils to make up for the chemicals stripping them away.|`|60mDEusiaa	Tell him to get some aquaphor creme and put it on the spot, after getting out of the shower.

As if!!     The doctor inserts a finger in your rectum to feel for any signs that there is an issue with your prostate gland. He will be looking for swelling. If you've never had a rectal examination before, it might prove a little surprising. However, the doctor will use a good lubricant to ensure there is no discomfort and the actual examination takes moments. It will give you great peace of mind and the benefit of knowing that the next time you'll be as blase and unconcerned about it as us answerers are.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	i get 1 every year. as long as your dr. is gentle with you then it,s not too bad. you better have your dr. do it because i doubt that your partner knows what to feel for.|`|E64juLwJaa	Yes I have had three:because I have diabetes.

The one doctor had me lay on my side and it hurt a bit. The other doc just had me stand there and lean over the exam table and it didn't hurt a bit. It may hurt just a little or be a little uncomfortable. Your partner at home probably would not know what to look for or how to interpret how big or small the prostate feels. About the only thing one could do to make the exam more comfortable would be to insert a well lubed b*tt pl*g at home just before going to the exam. That way, you are already "stretched out" when you go to see the doc. That's one thing you could do with your partner. Don't forget to take it out before you see the doctor...|`|QluSsz8Uaa	I have had several  exams and it is not as bad as one things. It was uncomfortable  but it was over quickly.

AA10096063	You need EXPERT (MD.) advise immediately.  SEE MULTIPLE DR.'s ASAP and keep a "very detailed log" of their advise.  If you are good with Excel make a chart and list Dr. Names, Advise, Time Frames, Symtpoms, etc. in various columns that you can easily reference. You have to be on top of your own care as you will hear many conflicting opinions.  DO NOT TAKE ONLY ONE OPINION.  Your case though sounds fairly straight forward.      Don't forget to breathe!  Give yourself a little break.  Listen to some soothing music- perhaps try taking warm baths daily (might make you feel better).  Realize that you are not only going through a physical issue but a mental one as well...which ironically will exhacerbate the other issues.  Fortunately, the mental trauma (and likely physical) will subside over time.  MANY people have experienced what you are so you are not alone!  I am sure many of them are fine.  You might strongly consider getting that IUD from hell out of your body ASAP.  Obviously it is the cause of so many issues.  The human body really wants to heal itself so your stomach issue, with care and time might get much better.  Hang in there and I wish you well.|`|5TM9P8tsaa	*It is simple, have ER remove the IUD and go on the pill. Not everyone can wear one. I had one in and it caused me to get cancer of the cervix. Have the darn thing removed. Any pain reliever can cause ulcers if taken on an empty stomach. Refuse to be discharged till they figure out the problem and remove the IUD. I would state you want to be admitted to the hospital and have a surgery consult about fixing the ulcers. Ulcers left untreated can cause death. You have to put your foot down when it comes to ER.|`|UzSaTblgaa	Go to your own doctor and don't stop asking for help until someone figures this out.  Make them listen to you!|`|ba57fb92aa421eaa3a4ae7f0f80f397caa	I don't know what is going on here, but it looks like the IUD isn't appropriate for you and you really need to find a different type of birth control.  About 15% of women that try IUD cannot used them due to pain (and sometimes bleeding).  I would guess that the problems will disappear soon after you eliminate the IUD, but it might take a couple of weeks.
5TM9P8tsaa	*Ok I have the whole lower spine like yours. Arthritis sets in after awhile. So you probably have arthritis now and that is where the pain is coming from. No way to fix it except surgery. I opt not to have surgery. I found a good pain specialist that injects it and releaves my pain. The ortho doctor I work with said once you have the problem there is no way to correct it except threw surgery. Back surgery takes up to a year to heal. I have had several friends go threw back surgery. I do not have a year to recoop so I take the alternate non evasive approach for now-the injections. Placing a lift in your shoe will not hurt you. You have gotten some bad  advice. You need to find a good orthopedic and explore the options that best fit your life style. Good Luck.|`|EMNwWAuvaa	Dave, here is my interpretation of the information given.  Since the right shoe is the one involved and it is the outside of the heel that shows the wear it makes me feel that the right leg is functionally shorter.  This would mean that the pelvis on that side has been rotated posteriorly thereby creating a shorter leg.  To correct for this there is a few very simple maneuvers to do.  One is to place the right foot on a stool or other object that places the thigh in a position of being parallel to the floor.  Now push down into that object with the right leg for a few seconds and then relax.  Do that a few times and then walk around.  There maybe a slight change in the way you feel but it will not be dramatic.  Doing that throughout the day should result in less pain and a freer feeling at the hip and lower back level.  The foot may also feel a little awkward in the shoe as it is no longer exerting the same kind of force that caused that problem.  Another way of handling this is to be in a lying or prone position and have the legs out straight.  Bring the left leg up to 90 degrees at the hip and then taking one of your hands and gently pushing into the thigh around the knee.  At the same time have the hip muscles gently push back into the hand.  Do that for a few seconds and rest but don't let the leg go back down.  After the rest bring the thigh up a little further towards the chest and repeat the exercise again.  Continue to elevate the thigh until it cannot go any further into the chest and then slowly return it to the floor.  Once back on the floor having both legs out straight squeeze the buttocks together as hard as you can while pushing the heels into the floor as hard as you can.  Do that for a second or two and relax.  Do that movement once more and then relax.  Lastly do a partial bridge movement keeping the feet flat on the floor and the shoulders also are going to remain on the floor.  This helps to align the pelvis.  Relax and roll onto one side or the other and get up.  Walk around and there might be some soreness in the pelvis area but there should be a release of pain or other symptoms.  Lastly, as for the prone push up position if it is bothering you then there are two things that come to mind.  One is that the position you are assuming is too dramatic and the other is that flexion positions are also necessary.  We do not walk and move around in an extended posture.  There are times when the body is bent over and it cannot be avoided.  The key to this is the pelvis.  What has to be strengthen is the tibialis anterior, the hamstrings, the gluteals, the muscles of the back and that includes the small rotators, and all of the abdominals.  To do this one needs to be with a physical therapist that knows that muscular balance is the key aspect of lower back control.  Unfortunately there are not enough of us out there that understand this concept.  Good luck with the neurologist.  I am not a fan of physiatrists as their answer is usually pushing pills or modalities as a way of controlling the problem.  The answer to these issues is in the muscles.  Find a therapists that understands that muscles have a memory and that until that memory is reset they are going to go back to that position that made them feel better no matter what it is doing to the body.  Keep on walking for in that movement you are loosening the rotators of the lower back and working the hamstrings and gluteals.  Do not get into running or jogging for they perpetuate the lower back problem and actually make it worse for someone with your problems unless they are a very skilled runner.|`|yLNsOJiQaa	As much as you may hate it you need to go see a chiropractor.  You need to do some research to find a good one in your area.  They can readjust everything and put things back where they should be.    I know that I had a relative that visited one while she was pregnant, I know that you are not pregnant..I am just saying,  to keep everything in line and loved it.  When she started to hurt she would go to her chiropractor and he would readjust her hips and pelvis and the pain would go away.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|BIlDIRNCaa	It is feasible to lose weight rapidly but you should be realistic and understand that if you lose weight rapidly then you will inevitably put it all back on again just as rapidly. The only diet which really delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials in stock, it was featured in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I worked off twenty five pounds, it really does produce results!|`|iYky05uIaa	Spend some time having a look at the link below, iam sure its gonna help you.|`|UY7AN1vUaa	One of the easiest things that you can do is get rid of sodas and drink water instead.  Another thing that a lot of people don't realize is that sometimes you eat because you think that you are hungry, when really you are just thirsty.  Drinking lots of water helps to fill you up and you'll want to eat less.  Water also helps to speed up your metabolism.  If you have a sweet tooth, try eating lots of fruit.  Of course eating an overabundance of fruit can be just as bad for you as eating a candy bar... but things with a lot of fiber, like raisins and apples will help to give you more of a full sensation also.  Grilled chicken is always a good option because it is low in fat and grease.  Also try eating yogurts and puddings, because they have a very low calorie content and make for a good snack.  :)  Hope this helps
8IIVBPwkaa	Yes, it probably will.

For example, if you take it the Sunday after your period, you will, from then on, have your period on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Everytime; just like that.  It also makes your flow alot more moderate--not heavy. It works miracles for your menstrual cycle! Good luck and God bless!|`|Z97CVElxaa	Yes but after a couple of months you body will be used to it. Also when you came off you body will have to readjust back so this could mess period up again|`|gQ63jsihaa	Most of the time it can because really you're supposed to begin taking the pill the Sunday after your last menstrual cycle but most women don't do that.

I used to use the NuvaRing, and I will never use it again because it made me want sex about as much as I want a flat tire.

Both of you need to work on this, you should talk to him about this. Birth control has no influence over your orgasm.|`|RdgSFkBLaa	There is a problem if you have never had an orgasm. Does he try to get you off? If this is a concern for him too then you should work on it together. If not work on it by yourself (hint hint). You need to make sure you know what you like and what you need from him. Guys dont know what gets us off, we have to teach them so experiment by yourself. One thing you can try together is to massage your clit like you would if you were masturbating. The best position for this is him from behind. He doesnt even have to know your doing it, but I guarantee it will be a turn on for him to see you do that. If you are not comfortable with that then you need to evaluate whether you are even sexually comfortable with this guy. You should not be ashamed of wanting to orgasm and how you get there doesnt matter. If you could orgasm you would probably get your drive back. As of now you have no incentive for sex there is nothing really in it for you if you are not having an orgasm...be selfish in this and make sure you get what you want.   Also, if you have a lot of stress that could affect your mood too. I have a difficult time getting in the mood so the best time for sex for me is in the morning when I am not all stressed from the day and what I have to do tomorrow. When I first wake up I am ready for it, but if I pass that window of opportunity, then it is difficult to get it back.|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.    However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.    My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com    What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.      Well good luck and I hope this helps.

My mothers best friend lost 17 pounds her first week, my mother herself lost 8 the first week.  It "clings" to any bad fats you take in (fried foods, etc) and makes you... essentially poo them out.  It forces you to choose between eating healthy and having no side effects ( which in turn makes you lose weight) or eating bad and having diarrhea (also in turn makes you lose weight).  Alli teaches you to eat healthy, makes you figure out what foods are low in fat, and in the meantime it gives you motivation by causing quick weight loss.|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Fruits and vegetables, as well as grilled, small portions of chicken and fish.

xXhuxyMkaa	St John's Wort has a counteractive influence in some cases; it may make a person feel more down, unfortunately.    If you are not on any medication now, try Viridian's Rhodiola, 1- 3x daily. Some people find that 2x daily is an optimum dosage.  It really is a wonderful herbal supplement, and it has helped many. Rhodiola is used to improve concentration, to uplift moods, to support the immune system (it is an adaptogen) to enhance physical and mental performance, to stimulate the nervous system, to fight depression, and to improve sleep.    In addition, you need to take EFA's, as without adequate amount of these essential fatty acids the metabolism slows down, you will feel sluggish and tired. All cells of your body need EFA's!    Take a look at what you eat. A diet consisting mostly of processed food is not food at all- your body won't get enough nutrients, it gets deprived. Sugar robs the body of vital nutrients. Salt disturbs the balance of many bodily functions. Fizzy drinks are pure poison to the body (incl. Lucozade!) As a consequence, all kinds of symptoms set in, including depression.    Fresh, unprocessed food is the fuel and medicine of the body and mind. You may need a good supplement; opt for Higher Nature True Food multivitamin- it is food- based, which means that it absorbs much better than other supplements because the body recognizes this multivitamin as food!    Exercice. Force yourself, if you have to, to go for walks at least.    Train your mind; any time a heavy thought enters, shout; STOP! I choose to release this depression- I don't need it any more...    If you need more advice, contact me in http://wholisticmagicalworld.ning.com/    You can ask your local health food store staff about diet; they should be trained to answer your questions.    NOTE FOR EVERYONE: if you are pregnant, on medication, or suffer from a medical condition, consult a doctor before making major changes in diet, exercice and/ or supplementation.

First off throw away your DHEA supplement, it CAN NOT be manufactured outside of the body, that supplement is a load of rubbish. You can stimulate your body's own production of DHEA by taking omega 3 fatty acids or olive oil, exercise will increase production, the herbs Black Cohosh and Wild Yam will also stimulate production as will general good balance in the diet.   Other ways to increase energy are to eliminate any possible food allergens, Siberian Ginseng, Ginger are also good energy stimulants. Look at liver support from herbs like Dandelion root and Milk Thistle. More antioxidants from fresh fruits and vegetable s are also beneficial in lifting overall vitality.  Avoid fatty, processed and sugary foods, all junk foods, avoid alcohol in excessive amounts, drink plenty of water and have some patience with the process. you will be bouncing around in a few weeks!

yY2Czxy2aa	It's very hard to get the actual berries. That's because they go off really quicky after they are picked (like, 12 to 24 hours after) so the stuff available in most of the world is juice or freeze dried.     As far as I can tell, there are no proven weight loss benefits from the acai berry, juice, or capsules.    It does seem to be a great supplement (I take it, but don't sell the stuff!) and is full of anti oxidents, which help prevent damage to your body. But that's what you should take it for, not weight loss or fat burning.     The acai berry itself is an amazing thing - has a lot of anti oxidents etc and is really good for you.    But there's nothing really to suggest in scientific terms that it helps with weight loss.     And there are a lot of scams out there, be careful where you buy it from!    I take it, and I think I feel healthier and better. But it's not some type of magic formula, sorry.     You can buy it in different forms - juice, capsules, etc. Or as a powder which you can add to other juices or smoothies.    You can buy it online, but be careful. Lots of sites selling it have a "free offer" thing, but to get it you have to sign up to a programme which sends you the stuff every month and bills you huge sums of money. Personally, I wouldn't buy from a website which is a company I've never heard of, there are too many scam artists in the business. If you are looking on-line, personally I'd go for a company which sells more than just one thing, and has a range of supplements or juices, they are more likely to be in it for the long term and not ripping you off.    You can also buy it in local health food shops, do a search for ones near you. I've bought it from Amazon, and from Holland and Barrett, which is a UK health food shop.|`|YKyjtVuOaa	The best form of the acai juice is in MonaVie.

AA11635143	IMMEDIATELY discontinue the homeopathic stuff and call your doctor.  It is never recommended that you combine antibiotics with non-traditional (homeopathic) treatments.    You appear to be having an allergic reaction to the antibiotics or to the combination.  The drowsiness (heaviness of your eyes) is a side affect of the antibiotics and the swelling of your eyes may be an indication of a SEVERE allergic reaction.  Call your doctor NOW because it appears you are in trouble.  The severe headaches are great cause for concern.  Get off the computer and CALL THE DOCTOR.  Hope you get well soon.|`|oojO4WAraa	Call your doctor - you could be allergic to that medication.  It will get worse with each pill you take.  Call the doctor.|`|mAp90hEeaa	You need to report these symptoms to your doctor because this could be the beginning of an allergic reaction to the antibiotic which would then require your physician to change the medication.

In the meantime, take some tylenol or ibuprofen for your headache.|`|HP0WqWXYaa	As far I know "Homeopathic" and "Allopathic" is not advisable at the same time.

xvey8ixPaa	I realky think you should wear them. Wear them full time for a few weeks and see how you feel.|`|GvgmSxdCaa	Astigmatism....    Is a term used to discuss the shape of your eye ...     For example if you wanted contact lenses ...    You would have to look for TORICS (especially made for people with this astigmatism)    In regards to your question you should wear your glasses as your eye doctor advised you to do so.|`|aiBOMU9kaa	First of all, that very minor amount of astigmatism ( -0.50) isn't what is causing any problems. It is too minor to make much difference.    Your myopia correction in the right is - 2.50, if both eyes were like that, there would probably be no question about wearing them all the time, but because your left is just - 1.50, you can get along without them.    Although that is a fairly big imbalance between your two eyes. The right needs correcting all the time, and the left doesn't.    That is what is causing your headaches . Your brain is trying to integrate two images, where one is very blurry compared to the other.    I would think wearing them all the time would go a long ways towards keeping headaches away.    KUPA 1972 has given you a whole pile of false information.  Wearing glasses correctly will NOT eliminate your myopia. Straining your eyes will NOT make them worse, and contacts do NOT make your vision worse either.    And if you were to look into getting contacts, you wouldn't need a toric lens on that eye either, the astigmatism correction isn't strong enough for that.    As the first optician answered, wear them for a week or so, and your problems will probably all go away.    It is quite normal for that much imbalance in your myopia to cause some discomfort when it isn't being corrected.|`|RdgSFkBLaa	It is a combination of both. You should wear your glasses, if you dont you will strain your eyes and your vision will get worse. In mild cases of myopia your vision can be corrected permanately if you wear your glasses correctly. I would suggest contact lenses, but they will only make your eyes worse over time. I had mild myopia when I was 12, and I started wearing contact lenses instead of glasses and by the time I was 30 I had a perscription strength of -6.00 and -5.75 with astigmatism in my left eye. I had corrective surgery recently and my eyes are perfect now. So wear your glasses or look into getting the corrective contact lenses that you wear at night and not during the day.  The eye pain is most likely the astigmatism because your eye has trouble focusing even with correction so without correction it is constantly trying to focus.|`|3c9884a48bc1c45a71c49ad35ed68daeaa	Your astigmatism is insignificant. Some facts......the furthest your right eye can see clearly is about 35cms and your left 66cms. So your eyes don`t synchronise;sometimes you`ll be seeing with the left and sometimes the right depending on how far away an object is.  Your eyes need to learn to work together and they only do that when your vision is equalised with specs.  Wear them a little longer each day over say two weeks and you`ll be OK with them full time.  Just be glad that glasses help you.  Many people with eye disease would pay a fortune if glasses gave them good sight.
uFRIsdC7aa	many people are allergic to wines and get the flushing, with a range of other symptoms-- the more you drink the worse it will be also may react to some types of wines but not seriously to others. some folks can't drink fermented beverages-- beers, wines because of allergies, but they are fine with distilled liquors (hard liquor). the wine allergies can develop later in life due to genetics or lifestyle, age or other factors. i'd stop drinking wines and stick to 1 or 2 mixed drinks (meaning only one type of liquor used, with one mixer, and ice) and avoid brightly colored party wapatoowee that you have no idea what it contains. the flushing is one of the mildest symptoms of the allergy and it gets more unpleasant. .|`|OikNR8Ufaa	Yeah sounds like you could be allergic to juniper berries...food allergies can come on suddenly.

Try benzoyl peroxide likethe other person said its in oxy and try clearasil aswell , to stop them coming up get a face routine! You could try makeup but that wouldnt help as i said leae them alone. Or if yo do want a cover up use a tinted concealer like a tea tree 2 in 1 one that will hide it and heal at the same time.

5DJcir9saa	It is extremely unhealthy to only eat 500 calories a day.  Especially for a man because they need to consume more than women anyways.  Everyone's weight fluctuates up or down five pounds, so tomorrow he may realize that his weight goes back up.|`|vwuMTm7Saa	I agree that long term it is not healthy, but for only 3 days, he should be fine.  Yes, it probably was weight that he'll gain back, but if you think about people who have fasted, it won't cause any long term damage.  No big deal.|`|fL3SiRDWaa	No, it is not healthy.  Also it is going to backfire.  They obviously cannot stay on this diet forever because that is just unreal! 500 calories a day is too less for anyone!  You have to be real about it, and match up how much you weigh to how many calories you take in.|`|BuOHv2XKaa	Not at all,  That is very unhealthy!!!    They will gain it back fast too!    And if they are an adolescence then it will stop them from growing without their carbs.|`|OBwqjS8maa	It was probably all water weight. There's no way you can lose fat that quickly. I will also say that 500 calories a day is extremely unhealthy, but I think you already know that.|`|l04kUKtHaa	yeah. he lost 5 pounds of muscle cause that's all you burn if the average adult doesn't consume at least 1200 calories. Your friend will gain that weight right back after he starts eating normally. It's unhealthy to eat less than 1200 calories per day. You'll lose weight but not the kind you wanna lose. You wanna lose fat weight, not water weight from muscle.    So, to answer your question: Yeah, it's normal to lose 5 pounds in 3 days if you are only consuming 500 calories/day. But certainly not healthy or a good diet!!!|`|5c571c4f67e0847c52fdcad82da07aa2aa	It's unhealthy and possibly dangerous.|`|l1QzfK8uaa	Yeah he is practically starving his body. Major Malnutrition can occur. He needs to take in lean meats and less fatty foods for a healthy solutions.|`|Ym90xu59aa	Yeah, for an anorexic.|`|U6C4Bywwaa	well if the person was only eating 500 calories then of course wuld drop weight quickly. So its "normal" but not healthy.
IgztWp0uaa	Your MIL may want to look into home based respite care. I think the real question here is if he can manage to get back to the house when he decides to leave it on his own? If he is just taking off like that and there is nothing that she can physically do to stop him, then it might be time to have "the talk" with his doctor about the worsening of his symptoms and the possibility that your MIL can not handle him as well as she used to.  It is imperative that she gets a break from him or she will be just as ill as he is in little to no time. If he becomes physically abusive, then it is time for all of you to discuss his options.  Good luck, I know how horrid this disease is. You all do not have an easy path ahead and my thoughts are with you all!|`|mAp90hEeaa	The decision to place someone in a nursing home is always difficult.  The decision is often made when it becomes physically impossible to keep someone clean if they are frequently incontinent, can no longer help someone get up out of a chair because they are too heavy, the person is doing dangerous things in the house (turning on the gas on the stove, etc) that is placing other people at risk.  There are lots of factors people use to decide when it is time.

You need to be a bit more specific in your description, it can be anything from a cold sore to glandular fever.
uFRIsdC7aa	First, water must be boiled in a pan. Then set aside to warm. After this, add considerable amount of salt then stir. Afterwards, put the cotton balls into the bottom of the pan, wait until the boiled water cools down to normal room temperature. It is important that the cotton balls are sunk deep into the liquid in order to get as much salt as they may absorb. Following this, get one of the wet cotton balls.    Lie down, facing upwards. Close your eyes and place the salted cotton balls on top of your infected eye. Remain in this position for about 5 minutes. The salted water will penetrate into your eyes, this will hurt a bit but hold on for this process is designed purposely to kill the infection. You may even see the running salt on the surface of your eyes, but this is not harmful. This home remedy for pink eye is known to be one of the simplest yet among the most effective.  http://www.ayurvedic-medicines.com/home-...|`|V3kzue7Zaa	Til your symptoms go away.      You should've gotten an anti-biotic and it should start kicking in by now.       Double check and Google how long the anti-biotic should take to kick in and start working.       I know for sure that working around food or serving food is not an option right now.        Your doctor sucks.  They should've told you all of this.
mAp90hEeaa	You should never stop drinking when you have vomiting and diarrhea.  That is the way to replace the fluids lost and if you don't do this, you will be in an ER getting IV fluids.  Until you have been back on solids for at least 2 days, the diarrhea will continue.  It will go away when your body has healed itself.  There is nothing in your bowel right now to stop fluids from going straight through.|`|dIMDPnQVaa	you should always keep hydrated and eat stufflike crackers and drink some 7-up to thicken it up|`|688a7b812dded24c0867e947aee9d86aaa	You MUST continue to drink water so that you do not become dehydrated and make matters worse.    Also, to be on the safe side you may want to consider calling a doctor.  Stomache "bugs" are typically a result of some sort of food poisoning and not a virus.  And with that giant salmonella recall going on, it's better to be safe than sorry.
n2x59icYaa	okay look, i was on probation, and i smoked 1 or 2 tokes at least 3 times a week and i still passed my DT's but i drink plenty of water always have... if you dont drink much water be careful is all i can say it depends on how fast your system flushes.   other then that you should be good, judging by the dates you gave.. you have nuthing to worry about.   hope this helps    oh yea and if you are taking a DT and you drink a bunch of water before you take it...

5TM9P8tsaa	*Call him back and tell him you are in a lot of pain. He should have given you a script for hydrocodone. Do follow his instructions with the once a day soak. In between use a cold pack on top of the foot. This will help with pain, swelling etc. Ibuprofen is to help keep out inflammation. Also place a tablespoon of Epsom Salts into the soaks. This will draw out any infection before it starts and help eliminate toe nail fungus. I am assuming that is why you had the toe nail removed and/or ingrown toe nail. The Epsom Salts will take care of that.|`|Zgs4RncIaa	You need to follow what the Podiatrist recommended. Try alternating between Ibuprofen and Tylenol.

emNCaAq7aa	One promising one is in the first stage of testing now. They have been testing it since 1998. It was originally a diabetes drug, like Byetta. It is different than Byetta in a number of ways. It defiantly works on a lot of animals. It (sorry for the "it" but I cannot remember the name or the company that starts with Gen...). The action is on hormones produced by the stomach and other organs, like grehlin.  They say it should be out by 2011 or 12    Edit found the name it is Trodusquemine (MSI-1436) by Genera|`|nSImzXv9aa	There is a three-way race between:    Orexigen Therapeutics Inc with Contrave;     Mountain View, Calif.-based Vivus Inc. with Qnexa;     and San Diego-based Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc with unknown.    Each company has an obesity drug in late-stage development, with goals of asking for Food and Drug Administration approval by the end of 2009.     Obese patients taking Contrave lost between 20 and 25 pounds, or between 9.3 percent and 11.5 percent of their body weight, The weight loss occurred over slightly more than a year. Contrave only reduced 4.2 percentage points more body weight than placebo based on one measure, shy of the FDA's bar. The company said the results should still satisfy the agency. Also, it still has three other late-stage studies on the drug, with results due in mid-2009 and hopes for an FDA application by the end of the year.    "The results of this trial indicate that additional, clinically significant weight loss can be achieved when Contrave is added to a rigorous program of diet and exercise," Chief Medical Officer Eduardo Dunayevich said in a statement.    Contrave also met secondary goals of improving HDL, or "good" cholesterol, and improved potential heart risks. The study used full doses of the drug, which is a combination of 32 milligrams of naltrexone SR and 360 mg of bupropion SR. The doses were gradually adjusted for four weeks, then given in full for 52 weeks.    The company also said the results showed a good safety profile, with no associated risks of depression or worsening of blood pressure. The most common side effects included nausea, headache, constipation and dizziness, with 4.6 percent of participants dropping out of the study because of nausea. That marks an improvement over a 11.1 percent discontinuation rate seen in earlier studies. The most recent study used a different release formulation of the drug.    The Contrave results come one month after potential competitor Vivus said its developing obesity drug Qnexa met a late-stage study goal of reducing weight versus placebo. In that study, patients taking 15 milligrams daily of Qnexa lost an average of 19.8 pounds over 28 weeks, while patients taking 7.5-mg doses lost 18.2 pounds.    Full-dose patients lost 9.2 percent of their body weight, compared with 8.5 percent for the half-dose patients and 1.7 percent on average in the placebo group. The most common side effects were a "pins and needles" sensation, dry mouth, altered taste and constipation.    A third potential competitor in the field is Arena, which could release late-stage study results on lorcaserin near the end of March. It hopes to apply for FDA approval by the end of 2009.
Q4ggnG0waa	These answers are all answering as if you were at his funeral, where you don't say anything. If your mom means for you to go visit him, go visit. You don't have to give him a eulogy to his living body. Just go with your dad, since it's his brother, and just visit with him. Words will come. If you have any memories of when you had him in your life, that's a good thing to talk about.

This means that they work very well, until they don't work at all in which case your stuffy nose becomes worse!    I strongly suggest you use more medical grade saline water (you can get it at a chemist/pharmacy) to rinse your nose twice a day. It's not pleasant to do, but it doesn't hurt. Then when you sleep, use at least 2 pillows so your head is in a slight angle. This will allow all the mucous to be swallowed while you sleep instead of blocking your nose.    Finally, you should check out why you have a stuff/runny nose. Is it an infection (if the mucous is yellow or green it's an infection in which case you're going to need antibiotics to clear it up), or maybe it's an allergy (i.e the mucous is likely to be white/clear).|`|mE1HSVTsaa	use vicks put some just under the tip of your nose.

Kashi makes all their foods with 7 whole grains (which is better than refined grains/white bread, etc because they are good carbs). No sugar is added as well, as they use other things that are healthier to sweeten them. They also use real fruit and no preservatives. Along with the soft cereal bars, they also make great cookies & cereal bars that are 100% healthy for you. As far as the taste..it's even better than the unhealthy version! You can find these at any grocery or department store. Wal Mart usually has Kashi items for around $2.50-$3.00 a box.

Hope i helped.  :)|`|OmDPJvo9aa	You have alot of blood flow close to the surface of your skin = redness, the sweating is just your metabolism at work getting rid of exces fluids. Don't "sweat" it, just stay in shape;)|`|FaHuLB3Saa	Your body needs oxygen to live.. Oxygen is carried by the blood. So when you exercise, your brain tells your heart to increase your heart rate in order to have more oxygen circulating in your body. So when your heart rate increased, blood moves faster in your body, and therefore you become red (due to more blood moving faster) and sweaty (the blood moving faster makes warms you up).    So now, if you don't get too breathless, is simply due to the fact that you are fit and/or used to exercising.
Ofh5zBanaa	Wow. the other people who answered this question are absolutely ridiculous. and they know nothing about smoking pot at all. i smoked and took a drug test 4 days later and passed. all's i did was drink a lot of water. two hits was probably in your system for about 2-5 hours. and if its a piss test your taking the only thing that matters whatsoever is how much you piss before you take it. but seriously man.  if you took two hits, and dont smoke regularly. it was gone a long time ago. especially if your skinny and you sweat allot. and people please stop answering these questions when you know nothing about the topic. if you havnt had personal experience with the subject then theres no reason to answer.|`|AA10771601	depends on your metabolism and how much fat you have on you.

You might be having pneumonia|`|vtDfg51waa	Sounds like you have tonsilitis or just a cold...I wouldnt worry  you might need antibiotics so you should go to the doctor|`|Y5c4uZ4Maa	I think it sounds like a sinus infection, that is leading up to bronchitis, this is not fun.. you should call your doctor, as soon as possible. as for swalling your tongue?? That sounds strange enough maybe you should ask the doctor if that could be the cause of the infection; because there are soo many germs on the tongue, and your throat is a very sinsitive area, maybe that is why in the past you would have a sore throat? But it definantly sounds you should give your doctor a call/visit. Hope you feel better soon.

ERaIVdN8aa	Unlikely, but possible.  Yeast, or Candida, is a bacteria, thus can be passed on any surface.  Candida can live on lots of surfaces....

It's really normal.|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	Good lord the questions on here....Answer mine first..Is there chicken in chicken soup?|`|54fdf2affdc8dc366315eec2cecd5920aa	Oral yeast infection is called "thrush," and is fairly common in infants.  One major cause of thrush in adults is intestinal yeast infection, or sometimes even systemic yeast infection in the bloodstream.  You see, the digestive system goes uninterrupted from the mouth to the anus; and a yeast infection in any part of it can, under some circumstances, spread through the rest.  Now, the vagina is close to the anus, and vaginal infection is often the result of contamination from the anus.  So, you see, both vaginal and oral yeast can be the result of a general yeast infection of the digestive system.  The yeast's name is Candida Albicans.  In the intestinal system it may or may not cause symptoms, depending on how well the immune system keeps it in check.    If you get any kind of yeast infection repeatedly, say 2 or 3 times a year, there is probably a reservoir of candida somewhere inside you.  If you think this might be the case, look up some info on Candida Albicans.

BC Powder and Goodies are aspirin that are sold in this powderized form.  They actually work faster than normal aspirin.

5ede303e3f09ef934bb1a71e8b13e26aaa	When they say that they mean change your routine in the gym or do slightly different exercises, they don't mean change the sports and activities you do.  For example, if you are doing free weights then do different free weight exercises or use weight machines for a while|`|y5i8GIFWaa	change it every 2 weeks
a4IR6tYqaa	There are several theories of exactly how is best, but focus on lower reps with higher weights.  Three sets of 8 reps each with higher weights at each successive set is one way.  This will force the muscle to work harder and thereby building the muscle to meet those demands.  What you are doing is to create endurance in your arms which is good too because half of your muscle fibers are used for endurance.  But for Definition you need to make the muscles stronger and the only way to make that happen is to force the muscle to work HARDER not must more.    Your arm definition and focus on training are also help by keeping your routine varied with different exercises for the same group.  Barbells, dumbbells, machines, can all be used interchangeably so long as you performing the same exercise.      Be sure to do both the biceps/triceps together and be sure the forearms and shoulders are no neglected.  The best theory is to have a well designed and planned training routine to incorporate good principles of exercise, diet, rest for your whole body is my recommendation.  Well defined arms are great, but if the rest of your body does not have a similar level of definition it will look awkward and could lead to injuries if you are not careful.|`|VeJH9b2yaa	lots of cardio also and you need to DROP the weight but increase the reps
qky1Q90xaa	The regimen is what counts. The downside to quick weight loss is twofold. First, you tend to lose muscle mass as well, particularly if you are not resistance training. Secondly, the faster the 'diet' or weight loss, the harder it tends to be to keep it off. Crash diets rarely work, and weight is hard to keep off for physiological reasons. Your body tried to maintain a 'steady-state' weight, which is to say it tries to minimize fluctuations, especially rapid ones. When you lose weight rapidly, your body works even harder to get back to its original weight. You have to be consistent and committed to a lifestyle change involving a balance of healthy nutrition as well as exercise. This will create a new setpoint for your weight (over time), and it will become easier to maintain a lower weight. If it is truly a lifestyle change and you look at it that way, you should not have a problem, though.|`|4Eb9RrFyaa	No, just don't starve yourself and choose a healthy diet with exercise.|`|boUAqkRiaa	Losing more than 2 pounds of week is unhealthy because instead of losing body fat, you start to lose lean muscle as well.  If you are obese and you lose a lot of weight in a short period of time it does not give your skin time to accomodate and you will be left with lose skin, which you could in time have to have surgery to remove.  I have just started diet, I am on my second week, I have lost a total of 13 pounds now, I am working on slowing my weight loss down by adding in extra strength training exercise so I can build lean muscle.|`|tIldpr7vaa	you could loss muscle as well if u lose weight too quickly
AA12098193	Insecurity has a highly negative effect in that it keeps pushing you into the pits. So insecurity stops you from going to school and then insecurity stops you from going back.  Insecurity is more than just a thought, it's an attitude towards life. You said "no one has no idea why" and neither do I, but you are not so sure yourself. Most people would have explained the reasons for not going as part of the question because people gain confidence through explaining or justifying their actions. You didn't, so if you happen to find your way back to school, you might not know what to say when someone asks you or you might not seem convincing.  So I think it's pointless for you to seek an answer to your question because you gain nothing from classifying your "insecure thoughts". What you must do is build your self image. Convince yourself that you are not a looser but admit that being a loner is your choice. then try to find explanations for the difference.|`|cf7e502388f77678bbc75e745e427e26aa	"Insecure or irrational thoughts" ...

Don't let yourself get stuck in that mud-pit. Put your thoughts into action.   You may be right about other people's reaction. Let me try to encourage you... just remind yourself the real reason of going back is to learn, right?

XhIYAH6Laa	Personally, for me it only took about a year and a half to get diagnosed, which obviously is a much shorter amount of time than many people.     What I have come to understand is that MS is not something you can diagnose with symptoms alone. MS symptoms often mirror symptoms of other diseases/conditions. For me once I went and saw a neurologist, he put me through a battery of tests including blood tests (to mark other things out), MRI's (of the brain and spine), brain nerve conduction tests, and a spinal tap. The spinal tap was really key.     Good Luck getting diagnosed, the main thing I can say is to not let  anything go. Voice your opinion at any stage during the testing. Confide in your neurologist, and make sure you trust him and his ability to help you receive the correct diagnoses and care, after all he will be involved in your medical life from here on out!     Again God Luck!|`|PnlgLBcwaa	What a great example of medical malpractice..

MS is primarily diagnosed with a spinal test---anMRI to look for lesions can also be used.
bvYPr0Cvaa	They can take time getting used to. I find that sitting on the edge of the toilet to insert them is the most comfortable for me. They wont hurt once they are in, if it does, take it out and try again, if inserted correctly their will be no pain. Make sure you are inserting the applicator all the way into your body - only leaving the finger grip area outside of your body, then push the applicator into the tube. If you don't have it inserted far enough, it will be very uncomfortable. Just take your time, you will get the hang of it.

AA11112224	I can really understand where this is coming from. What are your goals? To loose weight or tone up? If its a weight loss and you haven't seen ANY results, then there must be an issue. Make sure you are at least getting 30-45 minutes of a cario workout 4-5 days a week and are hitting your target heart rate. Between 130-160 is the normal target rate for most people. If you go to a gym, try using the elliptical instead of the treadmill as that works out more of your body. Also remember that if you are lifting weights, muscle weighs more than fat so you could be losing fat and gaining muscle at the same time. If you are trying to just tone up, make sure you still go your cardio, but then add in 5 alternating days of weights. Do legs 3 times a week, and then work on arms 2 times a week, and then vice versa the next week. This gets you in the habit of doing weights everyday. Never do the same area back to back though. Then do abs 3 days a week as well. Cardio is the biggest factor to lossing weight and getting rid of any fatty areas even if you are already skinnier. As far as food goes, make sure you are eating 3 meals a day with 2 snack in between to keep metabolism going, and that they are all healthy. Eat all fresh fruits, vegetables, only whole grain, only lean meat, no juices/sodas (even diet), no gatorade or high calorie sugar drinks--JUST water. Great snacks are peanuts, Kashi snacks, Luna bars (has a HUGE amount of nutrients in them), low fat dip and veggies, apples, bananas, etc. If you are going all this and still aren't seeing anything, it may be time to talk to a doctor or a weight coach about what is going on and why progress isn't made. Good luck!|`|8QZBLRhaaa	my motivation advise is to go to one of your favorite stores pick out something you  really like and buy it a size too small and let that be your motivation to fit into that article of clothing.|`|kRQlW5uNaa	quit looking at the scale....quit measuring urself....quit doing anything that would show if ur making progress....in the fitness world 4 weeks is not very much time...just stay on a healthy nutrient dense diet pan, DRINK LOTS OF WATER, and try to get 30 minutes of cardio 3 times a week, Weigh urself every thirty days...the results will come trust me...

If you think it came from your anus and the blood was red, then it is likely a superficial cut near the entrance, possibly due to straining? Usually blood from your bowel is a bit darker because it takes longer to be seen...    If you think it came from your vagina, it may be a period and the pain in  your stomach may just be menstrual cramping.     It really depends where you think it has come from.|`|3V1U3wxeaa	Presuming that at fifteen you are fully knowledgeable about your menstrual cycle, I would like to draw your attention to the two most likely things that could cause this, and only if the blood is fresh looking and red.  One is a hemorrhoid that has rubbed raw due to a hard stool, and the other is a fissure, which is a tear in the anus caused by too large and dry a stool.  At any rate, any blood from the anus at all should be reported to and followed up by your doctor, no matter how young you are.

Tell your friend to shovel snow, do chores, or mow lawns.|`|H79pMzNOaa	ok if you want to help the dude. just give him some  money and do not buy the smokes cuz no good friend would ask you to buy smokes from him.|`|AA12371982	So why doesn't he just ask to borrow the money instead of trying to sell you something you have no use for. Just imagine 10 years from now someone asking you how you started smoking and you respond  by saying you bought a pack of cigs to help your broke friend. You will sound stupid as hell. Is he 13  also(?) he doesn't have any bills to pay so whats the big deal. Tell him to go help an elderly with their groceries or do yard work, do something more constructive verses selling cigarettes to non-smokers. This was a dumb question why did I even bother to answer, oh I know for the points :)|`|YLifeRHPaa	Cigarettes contain Nicotine. Nicotine is VERY addictive. When you first smoke, you think- Ew- this is gross, I will never get hooked on this!   SO then you try more and think it's no big deal. Little do you realize that your body is becoming addicted. Soon you will crave cigarettes and feel like you need them. Plain and simple- cigarettes are NOT enjoyable to anyone, even people who are hooked and think they like them. Do yourself a favor and don't buy into the brainwashing that gives you the idea that there is anything good about cigarettes.     Your friend is not being a good friend to you by offering you cigarettes. But If your friend needs money and you want to help- maybe lend it to him?|`|RXI8ImdIaa	Duh..... no, you shouldn't smoke.    I've been quitting on and off for ten years. Starting this addiction is one of the most retarded things you can do to yourself. Don't start it.|`|TcBOmQcnaa	I would suggest you don't start smoking, although i cannot make that decision for you. What kinds of prices is he charging? and where did he get the cigarettes to begin with? Loaning money to a friend can sometimes destroy a relationship so i would also recommend against that.Some main reasons why smoking can be bad is because you could possibly get a smoking ticket(at least where i live) and that really sucks.

And every body reacts differently.  Are you willing to risk the life of an innocent child for a PB&J sandwich?  I really hope not.    Just avoid all PB when he is around.    Also keep in mind that he has a better chance to outgrow the allergy by about age 3 with 100% avoidance.  His chances of outgrowing it are reduced with any accidental contact.    Although there are no guarantees that he will ever outgrow it.|`|d11ac1603c7e53d874cecaa7631b2aa0aa	Why do you want to risk his life? Can you really not give up Peanut butter while he's there?

I don't know the rating for it but it does seem pretty severe.  You may want to check with his parents so you know exactly what is expected of you (ie child can be around PB but can't consume it)|`|LGidAYDwaa	A 6 out of 10 is very bad.  Any contact at all will cause your nephew to have an allergic reaction (peanut allergy is the most deadly allergy - you likely wouldn't have time to get him to a hospital if he ate any tainted food or used tainted dishes/utensils).    You'll need to avoid peanut butter while he's visiting.  Peanut butter has natural oils that tend to adhere to surfaces like dishes, utensils and skin. It's harder to remove than you'd think.

uuQrhnJ4aa	It depends upon your fitness, metabolism, height, weight, gender, & other health variables. The amount of other non-caffeinated beverages in your system. How much caffeine you've had & how accustomed your body is to it. How much you've eaten or not eaten. If you've taken any other diuretics (since caffeine is itself a diuretic). What medications are in your system-prescribed & over-the-counter.    So you see, it's a deceptively simple question. Virtually everything else affects it's excretion from your system and what it does while it's in there. For some ppl it can be gone in 4-6 hours. With some ppl, it can be 10-12.     It's excreted by the kidneys, so it doesn't hide out in your fat cells or anything like that. It's usually gone the day you consume it.    Some ppl are more accustomed to its effects & can drink it 24/7 w/out feeling alert, jittery or other unpleasant effects.    In this instance, your body is a chemistry set & anything you take can cause reactions w/what's already in your base chemistry. Since everybody's chemistry is different...many different outcomes are possible.|`|RJS6kJttaa	Once in the body, caffeine will stay around for hours: it takes about 6 hours for one half of the caffeine to be eliminated.|`|dD1WAPREaa	Sheep shouldn't be taking caffeine in the first place.    Sorry. It depends on the amount of caffeine taken, and whether you've developed a tolerance of any kind, and how much water you have had. Caffeine, like many other drugs, goes out of your body through your urine. If you are concerned about caffeine's effect and can't wait for the jittery feeling to go away, drink a bunch of water. They say caffeine can take up to six hours to completely exit the system.|`|TKbYavhzaa	The first answerer is spot on.  It also depends on your genetic makeup -- some people process it a little slower than others, and might still feel it for 12 or more hours.  And of course it depends on your tolerance; I drink enough coffee that a cup right before I go to bed doesn't make any difference.

No one is able to see any manifestations from outside and you keep on suffering and all the regular activities get disturbed. The reasons of all headaches are not same. There are various types of headaches which are caused by different reasons and the type of suffering also differs from the other.     The commonest forms of headache are tension type headache, migraine headaches and cluster headaches. The tension type headaches are manifested by the bilateral pain and this can last for 30 minutes to 7 days. Though this generally does not hamper the daily activities but recurring tension type headache can cause various problems.    The migraine headaches attack women mostly and it can last for 4 hours to 72 hours. The last category of headache is cluster headache. This is the rarest form of headache and the pain is often felt around the eyes and on either side of the head.     Causes of Headaches    According to traditional ideas the tension headaches are caused by the muscle contraction process. But the migraine or cluster headaches occur because of the dilation of the blood vessels. Brain swelling can be another reason of headache which mainly stretches the covering of the brain. Sinus inflammation is also counted as a cause of headache.     There could be many more reasons like excessive strain on the eyes, menstrual strains, stressful environment etc. Apart from the normal causes there are instances where headache is a manifestation of the serious physical problems like brain cancer, encephalitis etc.     Now if we consider the causes specifically then the reason of tension type headache is tightness of muscles in your face, scalp, shoulder, neck, jaw etc. This can occur due to stressful environment, severe anxiety or even depression. Sometimes if you are working too hard or not getting sufficient sleep or skipping meals, you can get the tension headaches.     There are certain food products like cheese, aginomoto, chocolate which can cause this particular type of headache. The recurrent migraine headaches are manifested through a pulsating pain. The cluster headaches are equally painful and they are observed in men mostly.     The people who are over the age of 50 years can get headaches due to temporal arteritis. This is a serious condition and consultation with the doctor is required.     These are all general reasons why an individual can get headaches. But there are rare causes as well. Brain aneurysm can be one of them.     When the walls of a blood vessel get weakened and it ruptures and bleeding occurs inside the brain, it can cause severe headache. Brain tumor is another reason of headache. The brain infections which are called meningitis, encephalitis etc are also reasons of headaches at times.
qi6a30eIaa	The information provided is not sufficient enough to reach any diagnosis. Is your son a smoker? If he's got Chronic Bronchitis that'll lead to secretions collecting in his airway which keeps irritating the throat wanting him to clear it all the time.Sometimes psychological problems like feelings of insecurity etc can cause him the symptom that you are describing.|`|77b8be2f1ecf565f6a86eeeaf1e79f5caa	One cause of constant throat-clearing is swollen vocal cords. The swelling causes the sensation of having something stuck in the throat-- typically the feeling of mucus, but nothing comes up..  If you son coughs, yells, cries, sings, hums, or whispers loudly often, that may be the reason the vocal cords swelled in the first place.  I recommend seeing an ENT for a firm diagnosis.
lWjd0WYBaa	becuase ur a fukn idiot|`|TCLsrse3aa	Because now you're full of sodium and carbs. You had no fruits or veggies or protein.

Your body probably reacted to the lack of nutrition and put your metabolism into a slower mode in an effort to save itself.  It's better to eat several small low-calorie meals every few hours to keep your metabolism up than to eat junk like saltines.    Also, saltines are nothing but salt and carbohydrates -- that'll make your body retain rather than burn.|`|F3WjMOgOaa	your body didn't get any of the necessary nutrients.|`|qky1Q90xaa	First, eating only crackers is preventing weight loss. You have to eat multiple small meals every day to boost your metabolism. Eating very little or the same thing all day every day only slows it, and your body enters 'starvation mode,' saving every calorie you give it. Small meals throughout the day (especially breakfast) is what will make you metabolism faster.  In determining a healthy appearance, feel, and lifestyle, simple bodyweight is not necessarily the best indicator. Especially if you start exercising when you have not previously had a routine, or if you suddenly increase your exercise regiment, you may not see a rapid change in weight. This is because as you exercise, your body undergoes muscular and neuronal growth, which may actually increase weight, offsetting any fat loss. This will likely be the case for the first 6-7 weeks or so if you are moving to a more healthy lifestyle that focuses more on exercise. You should slowly start to see more muscle tone at that point, and you WILL become leaner. More immediately, you she see improvement in strength and performance.  Dieting is also a dangerous path to follow. Instead, focus on a healthy lifestyle that balances food and exercise. Lean meats and a lot of fruits and veggies will help with that. Try to eat no more than 20% or your daily caloric needs worth of fat in order to lose fatty mass. Especially in our society, carbohydrates often have more to do with weight gain that anything else, so make sure your carbohydrates are complex carbs (whole grains, stone ground, no "white" bread or rice, or as little as possible). Whole grains keep you more full longer and take longer for your body to digest. They do not create the spikes in blood glucose (BGL) that simple sugars, white flour, or starchy products will. This means that less insulin will be produced by your pancreas after each meal, and therefore less fat will be stored. Another positive effect is that is reduces your risk of diabetes and heart disease. Depending on your goals, your balance of calories will determine how your body changes. If you want to avoid gaining additional weight or lose weight, a good ratio would be something like 40% protein, 40% carbohydrates, and 20% fat. Also make sure to read the labels on any food you buy. They tell you much more than the advertisements like "low fat" on the front of the box. A long-term lifestyle change that you can maintain will be MUCH for effective that a diet (after dieting, your body tries to return to its original weight, which is very hard to combat).  The most dramatic difference you can make is with exercise. Walking is alright to begin, but when you can you should bump it up. Try running for short intervals, then increase the length when you can. Also, weight training will lead to a more dramatic difference because you burn more calories even at rest. Cariovascular training is important as well, most most calorie burning takes place only while you exercise. Adding some lean muscle to your frame (replacing fat) will increase your metabolism drastically. It will burn calories while you rest and even while you sleep. This is because exercise induces the consumption of carbohydrates, while resting release hormones that metabolize fat. You actually burn a higher percentage of fat while at rest (though not an absolute amount - exercise is more calorie-intensive), so muscle that consumes more energy at rest will consume more fat.  Remember, weight is a very loose guideline for overall health, and healthy weight varies from person to person.  The big word for you to remember is commitment. Patience with this will be your strongest benefactor. It may take a while, but you should ultimately be very happy with your results, and you will stay that way instead of dieting and relapsing backward every time. Statistically speaking, the slower and more consistently you lose weight, the better time you will have keeping it off. This is a lifetime commitment, and you have to look at it that way. Good luck!|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Simple, because you body was starving and held on to what fat it could, in case you lost to much fat and starved! the only safe way is calorie counting, but no lower than 1.400 or your body will only hold on to the fat as you have just learned! and only eat food with 4% fat if you stick to this and combine with exercises you will lose the weight,i done this and lost 3 and a half stone! you should see the weight fall off at around 2 pounds a week ,but maybe a bit more in th first week but this will be mainly water.good luck.|`|fopJACCGaa	cause your body went into starvation mode and stored all those crackers as fat.|`|Wf7vVQGCaa	Probably because you didn't get up and move around.   Like exercising.     You can't lose weight if your just going to sit there and eat nothing but crackers for 2 weeks.    Do it the right way. Have 6 small meals a day and exercise.   That's how my brother did it and he lost 100 pounds.

It sounds to me like you are probably safe to not be pregnant.|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	If you want kids that bad then you are really going to have to learn more about your menstrual cycle and how conception occurs, you can have sex non-stop for the next 10 years but unless you are having sex while you are fertile it is biologically impossible for you to get pregnant.     You'd need to determine when you are fertile to know when to have sex. To do this you would have to use a method such as Fertility Awareness Method http://www.tcoyf.com for this you would chart basal body temperature, cervical mucus and cervical position daily to determine when you are fertile or not. Without using a method similar to this you would only be guessing what days you are fertile. The idea that you can get pregnant any time is pure myth, it's a half-truth scare tactic taught in sex education classes to make us aware that if not using birth control you can get pregnant. As many people don't take responsibility with their sexual health by studying outside of the classroom they continue to believe this myth, and don't apply common sense that would tell them that there are fertile and non-fertile days. You seem to grasp that there are days when you can get pregnant but you seem to be wildly stabbing in the dark hoping to hit them. I'm of the mind that if you don't understand these basics about your body and how babies are made and you haven't made any effort to learn then you have no place bringing a child into this world, you can't educate a child when you lack the education yourself, and sex education is vitally important.     A fertile couple only has a 25% chance of conceiving in any given cycle. A woman will ovulate one day per menstrual cycle, this takes place around two weeks before menstruation  around day 12-16 of an average menstrual cycle. The egg will only live up to 24 hours however within that time two or more eggs may also be released so all together a woman may be able to get pregnant for a day or two. About a week prior to ovulation the body produces fertile quality cervical mucus which helps protect the sperm and help it reach the egg, the woman is fertile for as long as there is cervical mucus leading up to ovulation as this cervical mucus can keep sperm alive within the vagina for up to 7 days. Combined a couple is fertile for around a week, for safety methods such as Fertility Awareness Method give a few days either side of these fertile days as a buffer so all together there are 8-10 days that are classed as fertile days, meaning the rest of the cycle consists of 'safe days' when you are not fertile. Basically your fertile the week before ovulation and a couple of days after.

gkqmrIAGaa	It's okay to do that but be certain that what you use is soaked in alcohol before to kill all bacteria.  I had this problem with both big toes it was really thick on each. Every night before I went to bed I covered the area with vaseline. You can rub it in lightly as a coating but use something like a q tip not your bare fingers. This not only keeps the matter soft and easier to pick out but it eventually smothered the infection by cutting off the airflow that it needed to live.  This completely got rid of my fungus.  I had tried prescriptions everything you can think of and nothing worked but smothering the fungus. You have to be persistent and reapply the vaseline after showering so that it is always there.

Z19lxWKOaa	Just relax a little more.    Sounds like you could be releasing adrenalin into your bloodstream (at rest) which make you concerned and leads to worry, then stress.    The dizzy spell after your heartbeat returns to normal [have you measured the rates BTW?] is a side effect of elevated blood pressure.    Measure your heart rate first thing in the morning after a good nights sleep:    1. Use your fingers on the (left) side of your neck  2. Use a second hand on a watch / digital clock to count for at least 15 or 20 seconds  3. Multiply the number of pulses you feel you get to make the seconds one minute (4 x 15 or 3 x 20)  4. This is your resting heart rate    5. Repeat this when you get the 'Really Fast Heartbeat' and you can compare.    As a young, physically active person this could be as low as 60 bpm (beats per minute) or up to 90ish.     When exercising, this should increase around 20% (one fifth).    If it gets stronger or more persistent, consider having a chat with a qualified health professional.|`|dcd11iUwaa	a lot of people have heart palpitations, did you drink caffeine or any other type of stimulants that day?

Like the other poster said, there's millions around the globe that do it ALL THE TIME. And I'm sure it's not by choice.    But your reasoning as to WHY you would, is what's important.    I sometimes go a couple days of just fruit in order to "reset" my digestive tract. It makes monitoring exactly how long it's taking to process a lot easier.    And it will shrink your stomach some, so that it'll take less food to feel "full" afterwards.    I overdid it during the holidays. But now I'm back to "normal". lol    Just eat when you're actually HUNGRY. If trying to lose weight is a goal. And never eat in front of the TV.|`|kRQlW5uNaa	Absolutely Horrible....ur not goin to lose fat that way....drink lots of water and eat 5-6 smaller meals throughtout the day instead of 3 big meals...ALWAYS EAT BREAKFAST! its key to weight loss it kickstarts ur metabolism into fat burn mode!|`|AA11607818	If you don't eat/eat much, then your body goes into survival mode by hanging onto fat.

But if you had a little fruit and vegetables, you could "not eat" for months.

lXJbuz2Yaa	When you mentioned painful menstrual cramps, one thing came to my mind - Endometriosis.  I was diagnosed with it & under the care of an Endocrinologist, I had lots of treatment for it.    Here is some information for it.  You can also google it for additional information.            Endometriosis is a painful, chronic disease that affects 5 1/2 million women and girls in the USA and Canada, and millions more worldwide. It occurs when tissue like that which lines the uterus (tissue called the endometrium) is found outside the uterus -- usually in the abdomen on the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and ligaments that support the uterus; the area between the vagina and rectum; the outer surface of the uterus; and the lining of the pelvic cavity. Other sites for these endometrial growths may include the bladder, bowel, vagina, cervix, vulva, and in abdominal surgical scars. Less commonly they are found in the lung, arm, thigh, and other locations.    This misplaced tissue develops into growths or lesions which respond to the menstrual cycle in the same way that the tissue of the uterine lining does: each month the tissue builds up, breaks down, and sheds. Menstrual blood flows from the uterus and out of the body through the vagina, but the blood and tissue shed from endometrial growths has no way of leaving the body. This results in internal bleeding, breakdown of the blood and tissue from the lesions, and inflammation -- and can cause pain, infertility, scar tissue formation, adhesions, and bowel problems.        What are the Symptoms of Endometriosis?    Pain before and during periods    Pain with sex    Infertility    Fatigue    Painful urination during periods    Painful bowel movements during periods    Other Gastrointestinal upsets such as diarrhea, constipation, nausea.   In addition, many women with endometriosis suffer from:     Allergies    Chemical sensitivities    Frequent yeast infections   Diagnosis is considered uncertain until proven by laparoscopy, a minor surgical procedure done under anesthesia. A laparoscopy usually shows the location, size, and extent of the growths. This helps the doctor and patient make better treatment choices.         What Causes Endometriosis?    The cause of endometriosis is unknown. The retrograde menstruation theory (transtubal migration theory) suggests that during menstruation some of the menstrual tissue backs up through the fallopian tubes, implants in the abdomen, and grows.  Some experts believe that all women experience some menstrual tissue backup and that an immune system problem or a hormonal problem allows this tissue to grow in the women who develop endometriosis.    Another theory suggests that endometrial tissue is distributed from the uterus to other parts of the body through the lymph system or through the blood system. A genetic theory suggests that it may be carried in the genes in certain families or that some families may have predisposing factors to endometriosis.    Surgical transplantation has also been cited in many cases where endometriosis is found in abdominal scars, although it has also been found in such scars when accidental implantation seems unlikely.    Another theory suggests that remnants of tissue from when the woman was an embryo may later develop into endometriosis, or that some adult tissues retain the ability they had in the embryo stage to transform reproductive tissue in certain circumstances.    Research by the Endometriosis Association revealed a startling link between dioxin (TCCD) exposure and the development of endometriosis. Dioxin is a toxic chemical byproduct of pesticide manufacturing, bleached pulp and paper products, and medical and municipal waste incineration. The EA discovered a colony of rhesus monkeys that had developed endometriosis after exposure to dioxin. 79% of the monkeys exposed to dioxin developed endometriosis, and, in addition, the more dioxin exposure, the more severe the endo.|`|EqSvWjwPaa	You couldn't be getting enough Fiber|`|1FWYRIchaa	menstrual cramps//  you join to Dr.MD.

AA11659150	You won't know for sure unless you call your doctor and go in to have an XRay done.  More than likely, it's just a bruise, sprain, or strain and I have been told that those can hurt even worse than breaks.  If you are or have been walking on it this long, I really doubt you've broken anything.  Trust me, you'd know it.      Try elevating your leg on some pillows, icing it, not walking on it too much and taking an OTC pain reliever like Advil that will help with inflammation (Tylenol won't do that).      I'd still call the doc.  If you've injured a ligament, continuing to put pressure on it could exacerbate the problem.  Falling over on it first thing in the morning doesn't surprise me though.  It would have been stiff from you laying down all night.  Not a symptom to truly panic about except that it confirms you've obviously injured yourself.      Although it probably isn't that serious, you lose nothing by seeing if they think you need to come in.  You are the only one who knows how it feels and if you really need some attention on it.|`|AA11226163	You need to see your doc and then get an MRI to see the muscle damage.

y6jPCsi2aa	The Anshar Diet    As an American I've seen enough crazy fad diets in my day to fill several weeks full of infomercials and advertisements. As such I'm going to give you the benefit of many years of health and nutrition classes and do my good deed for the year.    I'm going to tell you how to not only lose weight but change the composition of your body, increase your health, and best of all.. keep it off.    First, let's dispel some common myths.    Myth 1:  Eating less calories will make me lose weight.  Unfortunately this isn't always true. A lot of different factors program your metabolism but one of the key things is how OFTEN you eat. If you fast all day long and then have a 500 calorie meal at the end of the day almost ALL of it will be stored by your body.    Myth 2:  I can have a diet with no carbs and be healthy.  This really is a testament to how much Americans want a quick fix. Diets like the Atkin's Diet cause your body to start devouring itself, increase your cholesterol, and in certain cases can even kill you. One thing I WON'T argue, death will indeed cause you to lose weight, permanently.    Myth 3:  If I go on a diet I will lose weight.  99% of people who go on diets will end up putting on MORE weight than they lost from a diet. This is because diet is supposed to be a LIFESTYLE change, not something you do for 2 weeks. If you starve your body it will make fat cells and increase their size even faster.    Myth 4:  I need to go out and exercise to lose weight.  This isn't actually true but it's important to say that having daily activities WILL keep you healthy. If you burn almost no calories every day what else do you think your body is going to do with them? Balancing a healthy lifestyle with a good diet is what you want here, not killing yourself by running every afternoon.    Myth 5:  The scale in my bathroom gives me a good idea of how healthy I am.  The dreaded bathroom scale does NOT tell you how healthy you are. Let's say I have 10 lbs of fat, don't drink water, and have little muscle mass. Then I work out for 3 months and hydrate every day. I lose 5 lbs of fat but gain 7 lbs of muscle and 3 pounds of average water weight. What will happen when I look at the scale? Are you being fair to yourselves? Judge yourself by how you feel, not what a spinning number under your feet tells you.        With these common myths out of the way I'll tell you the secret. It's five simple steps.    ~~The Anshar Diet~~  1. Only eat until you are no longer hungry.  This does NOT mean that you starve yourself. It means after you take a few bites of food ask yourself if you're still hungry. If you're not, into the fridge it goes. While we're at it, CHEW YOUR FOOD. at least 10 times per bite (using common sense if you're eating applesauce, this isn't an excuse to be an idiot).    2. Eat at least 6 (more if your schedule allows) meals a day.  I know this seems counterintuitive, but hear me out. If you eat 6-8 meals a day the meals are very small (often around 100-200 calorie "snacks"), provided you are only eating until you are NOT HUNGRY. When your body is not hungry your metabolism will not try to store energy as fat. It really is that simple. Smaller meals aid in digestion, they increase the nutrition you get from your food, and they keep you from being lethargic. If you eat when you're hungry your body stores MORE of it as fat ("Hmm. I'm hungry, I don't know where my next meal will come from! I'd better hold onto this.")    3. Eat BEFORE you get hungry.  Schedule your 6-10 meals throughout the day and stick to them. If you're waiting until you get hungry to eat you've already screwed this up. Your body stores energy if you're hungry, if your body sees food and just takes what it needs then you're running at optimum efficiency. This is called programming your metabolism.    4. Eat breakfast. Always.  Your first meal of the day is also the meal you have no choice over being hungry for. Your body has been replenishing itself all night and needs fuel. Since now you KNOW that hunger means you store your food then that means you want to keep breakfast LIGHT. A cup of cereal and a banana. A granola bar and an apple. LIGHT does NOT mean you skip breakfast. If you skip breakfast you are telling your metabolism to turn ALL of the next meal you eat into stored fat.    5. Drink water.  (I'm a big hypocrite on this one, but I can't stress it enough) Most people think that if they pick up a glass of orange juice instead of a soda they're doing themselves a favor, and that's not entirely true. A glass of orange juice can have just as many calories as some sodas. Try looking at the label sometime. If you're thirsty, drink water. If you love your soda then have your soda (real soda, not diet, artificial sweetners have been argued to be one of the worst things to ever happen to western civilization). If you decide to have a drink to treat yourself, pour yourself a half glass, don't take a can or bottle with you and for go
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|2oc6TDiGaa	eat carbs for breakfast and than like meat/fish for lunch and salad for dinner and get in some cardio|`|qZF4r71taa	One word...exercise.

You will no doubt hear about many types of diet but here is a few facts and tips that you need to know that will help you.    The only way to lose weight is to do two things. EAT CORRECTLY & EXERCISE.     Doing crash diets or cutting out meals will only confuse your metabolism and although weight loss may happen by doing this you will quickly put it back on. You need to eat a balanced diet and take exercise.    Eat 1400 to 1500 calories per day, You should eat small helpings and should eat at least 4 times a day. I suggest: Breakfast, Mid morning snack, afternoon lunch, Tea (or dinner as some call it) and then early evening supper.    Drink lots of water, tap water is fine, there is no need to buy bottled water.    You should find you will lose weight quickly in the first couple of weeks of any diet. This will slow down as your body adapts to the intake you give it. 1 to 2 pounds per week is a good return for you efforts so you should have no problem reaching your targets.    Good luck.|`|fcxLr7S9aa	stick a toothbrush down your throat and throw up alot and dont eat anything, then go jog 5 miles|`|REoNMbanaa	If you're 15, 5'5'', and 120 pounds, you're perfectly healthy for your age. Possibly even considered underwieght. If you're feeling bloated lately, try drinking more water and less soda. Water helps you lose weight because it flushes out toxins and doesn't add extra fat. Also, try a sport like swimming, dancing, or running. Those burn fat fast, especially swimming.   Don't resort to starving yourself, because you are a healthy weight. Excersize for at least a half hour daily, and eat the right foods while drinking plenty of water, and you'll be fine.|`|9hTPsTvFaa	hi it sounds like your a healthy weight but if u want to tone up and lose a few lbs. eat healthy 1600 cals a day, fuit and veggies, lean protein and limited wholegrains, . take an exercise you enjoy, swimming, dancing, surfing, walking, jogging, kick-boxing, tae-bo...ect the list is endless. find something you enjoy and do it 3 to 4 times a week and try and get in 30 mins of brisk walking everyday. im 5 ft 3 and went down to 105 lbs,, which was actually too thin for me... just by doing what i advise..i used to jog for 30 mins followed by 30 mins brisk walk 3 to 4 times a week and i walked to uni everyday.at weekends d usually walkinto city centre.   good luck and also i cant stress enough that given your stats id say you have a lovely figure. dont lose more than 7 lbs!!..and to be honest u dont even need to lose that.  . look up side effects of anorexia on wikipedia.. enlarged ventricles which anorexia causesis the same brain abnormality found inschizophrenics, basically your brain loses mass and shrinks so the ventricles get larger. do u want to damage your brain and risk lowering your IQ and this is just one of the side effects of anorexia.. be healthy and u will be attractive and smart.
uFRIsdC7aa	Metabolism gets blamed when people put on weight or have trouble losing weight, but you can learn how to speed up your metabolism. Increasing your metabolism can help you burn calories, replace fat with muscle and give you more energy. The key to increasing your metabolism is understanding what it is.     Metabolism is a combination of physical and chemical processes called anabolism and catabolism. Anabolism is the constructive phase of metabolism in which body cells synthesize protoplasm for growth and repair. Catabolism is the destructive phase of metabolism in which complex substances are broken down into simpler compounds producing energy which is essential for the proper functioning of body cells. Together, these processes distribute nutrients which are absorbed into the blood after digestion.   http://consumeraffairs.com/nutrition/met...|`|8SRjELNBaa	"so if a girl eats 1200 calories(but seperates them into six small meals)"    You want that meal plan if you plan to speed up your metabolism, which will cause your body to lose more calories, go with the first one (the one i copied and pasted), it makes a difference.    Good luck!|`|Cf4Ywe23aa	Very much depends on the person, no one diet works for everyone!    If you eat more often then your body is less likely to think that food is scarce and therefore try to conserve as much fat as possible so you have reserves for when there is no food (which in our society is never!!)  Metabolism is a very personal thing but that's more or less the thinking of it!    Also, exercise keeps your metabolism high.|`|r2iMJgIqaa	you should eat at least 5 small meals a day.  your metabolism will be working better if you use this method.  i know it works because i do it and its very effective. =]    good luck sweetie, i hope you reach your goal =]|`|bT713RWqaa	i have tested this theory! from eating 3 larger meals, breakfast lunch and dinner, at the same time each day.    then trying out eating smaller portions 5-6 times a day.... and i find that it is more effective to eat smaller portions. sure your consumption of calories may be the same, but it takes your body to break down the foods less time for smaller meals and your metabolism is working all throughout the day.    i've lost 12lbs in 2 months.... of course, mild exercise is in there too.|`|KRLnHjtAaa	basically its because with the 6 small meals your stomach has more time to deal with the food rather than having too much and converting it to fat.|`|CCXvtRxSaa	i guess it's different for everyone. but they do say that spreading your meals out speeds it up. also how much you exercise and how active you are during the day would change it.|`|kRQlW5uNaa	Yes that is true because the girls metabolism who eats the six smaller meals will be burning faster...think of it this way...If u throw a giant log on a fire its goin to burn slowly over time(girl   2)....but if you throw little sticks on a fire more often they will burn very quickly! (girl   1) hope this helps!|`|AA10391420	Exactly!!  You are eating the same calories but your body will burn them faster if you it them in separate meals, because your metabolism will digest food all day long and burn more energy!|`|PeNdDqk8aa	You're taking in the same amount, but because your body is constantly working, you're burning more.

It is an old gene from when humans were hunters and gathers that kept them from starving.  anything less than 1000 calories is considering starving.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Bleeding after sex doesn't necessarily mean something is wrong, if it's happened more than once then it may still be nothing but mention it to a doctor to rule out anything serious. Light bleeding is normally caused by friction as your partners penis moves, this causes swelling and small splits in your vaginal walls, it's easily prevented by more foreplay before penetration or using lubrication on days where hormonal changes leave you a little dry...or when you're going at it like bunnies and your natural lubrication dries up. Lubrication is as important to safe sex as condoms so be lube-smart as some may damage condoms (oil-based) or toys (silicone based), know what lubes are best for what sexual activity and have fun trying different types to see which are best. Another common cause of light bleeding is damage from toys or your partners fingers so also make sure your partner trims their nails and check toys for any seams with rough edges.     Heavy bleeding would scare any woman or simply make you think your period has come early, well early period is one obvious cause, otherwise the most probable cause is an injury to your vagina or cervix while thrusting, if he was going at it too hard and you were not well lubricated, if you suffer from vaginismus then this is a probable cause. Increased bleeding does not necessarily mean something more serious, it's still more than likely down to vaginal damage from a lack of lubrication or you both going at it too hard and rough for too long. Other possible causes are birth control methods such as IUD's or diaphragms irritating your cervix, if you use these methods and feel discomfort then discuss different options with your doctor. There can be problems with your vagina itself including polyps on your cervix or vaginal infections and STI's so if reoccuring see a doctor to rule these problems out.|`|Dkg7sqxIaa	it was probably your hymen breaking dont worry too much|`|6yZ3Dunzaa	Bleedthru bleeding is a sideeffect of most birth control, especially if it is new for you.  Unless there is pain involved I wouldn't worry too much yet.|`|yLTIm5Vqaa	If you've ever had sex or used a tampon, it's very unlikely that this was your hymen breaking. It was probably just some breakthrough bleeding or spotting, which is totally normal, especially for girls on the pill.   If there was any pain, it may be that he scratched the wall of your vagina, which is also nothing to worry about. But if it's a reoccurring thing you may want to ask your doctor.

k5Dx1MfWaa	Kyle many boys look at the size of others who's penis and testicles look bigger (usually then what they have). Sometimes in fact their penis and testicles may indeed be larger, or smaller. In any case no one should make fun of another no matter what. Our penises all work the same, and many boys and men have lost their girlfriends or wife's to another with much smaller penises, or with a much larger penis. No matter the situation, it's not the size of our package that makes us men. We all like to have a large one for when we are viewed by others like at the urinal or in the shower. Some boy's and men or gay or homosexuals and like the looks. In any case just be you, be proud of what you have, and never be ashamed or make fun of others for what they have son. And if the other is gay he will not hurt you, look at it this way son this kid must like what he see's so be proud. You must have a nice size, good looks or both huh?Good Luck!

Try avoiding foods that raise blood pressure (salty foods) and eating foods that lower blood pressure (those high in potassium).|`|pQUr9a5Daa	High blood pressure (HBP) is a serious condition that can lead to coronary heart disease, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, and other health problems.    "Blood pressure" is the force of blood pushing against the walls of the arteries as the heart pumps out blood. If this pressure rises and stays high over time, it can damage the body in many ways.  Overview    About 1 in 3 adults in the United States has HBP. HBP itself usually has no symptoms. You can have it for years without knowing it. During this time, though, it can damage the heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of your body.    This is why knowing your blood pressure numbers is important, even when you're feeling fine. If your blood pressure is normal, you can work with your health care team to keep it that way. If your blood pressure is too high, you need treatment to prevent damage to your body's organs.  Blood Pressure Numbers    Blood pressure numbers include systolic (sis-TOL-ik) and diastolic (di-a-STOL-ik) pressures. Systolic blood pressure is the pressure when the heart beats while pumping blood. Diastolic blood pressure is the pressure when the heart is at rest between beats.    You will most often see blood pressure numbers written with the systolic number above or before the diastolic, such as 120/80 mmHg. (The mmHg is millimeters of mercurythe units used to measure blood pressure.)    The table below shows normal numbers for adults. It also shows which numbers put you at greater risk for health problems. Blood pressure tends to goes up and down, even in people who have normal blood pressure. If your numbers stay above normal most of the time, you're at risk.       Normal   Less than 120   And   Less than 80    Prehypertension  120139    Or   8089      High blood pressure                   Stage 1    140159  Or  9099   Stage 2    160 or higher  Or  100 or higher    Hope I can help|`|89ada36c62631624f6355e1ed2b3cde7aa	um..i don't think so...you have to check your blood pressure several times to make sure that u're having high blood pressure...i suggest you to check with doctor about this...sometimes nervousness will cause your BP to rise and taking caffeine also can increase your BP..so better check again with the doctor...
ufgv7oTjaa	Yes, it's sometimes prescribed for anxiety (which could include flying when you're nervous about flying). You can find out more information at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorazepam    Personally, I wouldn't use it very long (mainly because of the side effects listed) and just save it for shortly before and during the flight. If you just use it for the flight to curb your anxiety, you'll have the best impact and the least side effects. Good luck!
VnLaUS3Jaa	jumping on the trampoline helps me to keep my weight down during the winter months.    it's easy on your joints, and when done to fun, upbeat music, really isn't all that boring!    when you jump, you are pretty much using all your muscles, and it gets you breathing pretty hard - so it's evident that it's great cardio.    while it's better than nothing, just try not to make this your sole form of exercise.|`|RW6YWEc2aa	tampolining is no doubt a great exetcise method...but it's effectivness varies.    if you're just planning on loosing a view pounds or trying to tone up your body, then it should be fine.  But..if you're trying to loose a couple of stones...then you should opt for something more effective like cross - trainer or treadmill.    overall, trampolining is good exercise|`|IINSHqz2aa	Depends on how you use it I would imagine.  Personally, I need someone to make me exercise.  I had a stair stepper machine...it was a clothes rack.  The treadmill was a coat rack.  If motivation is going to be any kind of any obstacle, I would recommend joining a gym or fitness center.
Cf4Ywe23aa	Important question - why the heck do you want to join the army!?!    That aside, you increase your BMI by increasing your weight, you can do that by gaining muscle, fat or both. I suggest you eat a lot and don't do much cardio at the gym. Don't eat junk though, just up your portions. If you need to do it quick, eat the same foods as you usually do but eat twice the amount.
suLTN10laa	1st of all you can not increase or decrease your BMI, unless you are still growing or rapidly getting older or younger...your BMI stays the same for your Height and age.  If you mean how to increase your actual body mass to reach your target BMI...  That depends on if you are male, female, how old you are and how appropriately you wanna do it.  To effectively gain muscle mass, try eating protein and low impact weights, no cardio...sounds like you are probably young and have a high metabolism...some people cannot gain at all...too many variables for any one other than a dietitian or trainer to give you a proper "correct" answer for you.|`|VPkuM2xWaa	BMI is not a true estimate.   Mine says I'm at risk of heart attack. It doesn't take into consideration I'm athletic.|`|nBMVi9t8aa	????????|`|PeNT1RzBaa	Eat more calories.

You should try to gain some weight by eating more, or eating more fat, and if that doesn't work, go to the doctor and have a blood panel done to check for any medical problems.  It is possible that you just have a very fast metabolism and one day it will probably catch up to you.  I am 5'8" and I was always like 110 lbs which is considered underweight but now I am 145 8 years later!  I am now within a healthy weight for my height, and my BMI is 22.  Its healthy although sometimes I feel fat :/
4yzxXO1haa	6 medications? Are these all for ADHD or are there other issues he's being treated for?  Taking too many medications in conjunction with one another can be very dangerous, especially in a 7 year old. Were all of these medications prescribed by the one doctor? If so, I really think you should seek a second opinion soon. If they were prescribed by several different doctors, you need to go to whichever you one you prefer and have a talk to him/her about all of these meds and see about cutting back.  Also, consider a change of diet and exercise to help manage your son's ADHD. It has been proven to be just as effective as medication, and in some cases has worked when nothing else will. Have a look at these pages, and perhaps consult a dietician:  http://www.homeschoolmath.net/teaching/a...  http://www.nativeremedies.com/adhd-diet....|`|89fc809291d1b95a8d32164fe467ae3baa	I'm sorry for your kid.

I would also recommend seeing a neurologist....instead of a psychiatrist or a psychologist....|`|JupD4mQYaa	you are born natural   so stay away from those meds.|`|BLD9EEWNaa	I can't believe you medicate your kid at all!  What seven year old doesn't seem adhd?  Probably his sleep problems come from the meds.  Get him off everything and start from square one, otherwise he may be heavily medicated with issues that never would have been there for years.|`|yAsLhdp2aa	omgosh! he is overmedicated already. see if you can find a second opinion/pediatrician.

It kills me when someones tooth hurts they want it pulled.  What happens if your arm or leg hurts?  Should you get that pulled too?  And if your tooth needs to be pulled, please remember the excruciating pain you had to put up with and prevent it.  Get your teeth fixed, floss your teeth daily and brush.  Then you would only need to go every six months for checkups and cleanings.  Your teeth are very important to your health.  Dentists are Doctors and obviously had to go to school for their profession so they are not dumb.  As far as greed, well if we took better care of our teeth we wouldn't be put in that predicament.|`|e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	Sometimes they are dumb and greedy.  I've run into both.  Why you need a tooth out, I don't know.  But I can tell you that long term chronic infection can lead to other health issues like heart disease, cancers and diabetes in addition to acute life threatening flare ups.

You can try a low cost or free clinic to at least get it checked.|`|gJXtAPQJaa	If its hurting, im afraid somthing is wrong with your Jaw.    You will need t get that checked some way or another, does your country not offer welfare health care? If not, you should get that checked before it develops into somthing worse.    It may heal on its own, but chancing on that is a big risk you your health, I recommend seeing a docotor or going to a Clinic, even if it does cost.
AA12086526	You present with a strong suggestion of kidney stone, with waves of severe pain in your flank.  Occasionally, there will be red blood mixed in your urine.      The pain is difficult to relieve, depending on the size and placement of the stone.  Small stones can pass more easily with drinking lots of water and applying a warm compress  over your back and flank.    It would be wiser to see a doctor as soon as possible and get prescription pain medication.  Occasionally a hospital stay  is necessary for medications.      In some cases, the doctor must go in and remove the stone, usually by cyctoscopy, which is done while you are asleep.|`|mde1I2Qoaa	Well it depends on your gender.  When it comes out for girls, it's pretty easy for it to pass through.  But for guys, holy damn it's gonna hurt like hell. I think you can ask your doctor to get it surgically removed.  By the way, the surgery is almost pain-free so go ask about it. Good luck lol.|`|BsRMGbCDaa	aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh it hurts really bad.|`|AA12279950	I had a suspected gall stone.  The pain was indescribable.  It made labour seem like a walk in the park.  I was doubled up in agony - it came in waves - on and off for ten days and dosed up to the eyeballs with painkillers.  I was in and out of hospital the whole time.  Then the pain went, as quickly as it arrived.  I was scanned all over but there was no evidence indicating what the origin of the pain was.  The gall stone was just a theory but it was never proven and I certainly never had any pain in passing anything.  The pain was mainly under my ribs on my right hand side.|`|5TM9P8tsaa	*It can also be the gallbladder. You really need to go to the hospital or your doctor so they can do a scan of the area and tell which it is. No one can help you on this. I am so sorry for the pain. If it was a kidney stone you would be doubled over in pain. My brother in law had one and the pain was constant. So your next step is the hospital. Take an overnighter suit case with you. If it is a stone they will keep you till it passes. If you can not pass it then they operate to get it out. Passing it will be painful. I am guessing gallbladder but then I am not a doctor.|`|BnR4LLhxaa	Women have said that the pain of a kidney stone is a close as a man can ever get to experiencing labor pains.  You really should go to a doctor or the ER to find out if that is the cause - others have pointed out some other possibilities, and there's no point trying to relieve the pain until you really know what is causing it. Once diagnosed, the docs can prescribe some pain meds.  Some kidney stones can be broken up into smaller pieces through ultrasound - helps them pass.
IINSHqz2aa	I use the whey powder when I want to skip a meal.  Or when I'm feeling hungry in the evenings.  Whey is basically protein, I would recommend using it before you exercise.  The key to weight loss is to decrease calories intake by 500 calories.  I would also watch the peanut butter, it is really high in fat.  11-15 grams of fat for 2 TABLESPOONS!  Try to keep fat grams around 30 grams per day (cause your body needs some fat to function properly.  And lastly, PORTION CONTROL!  If you look, a portion is usually 1/2 cup, for the calories on the package.  I sounds like you are doing well with the food portion, are you exercising?  If you start walking or doing some rigorous exercise, the weight will come off quicker.|`|kRQlW5uNaa	Split ur meals up into 6 smaller meals instead of "breakfast, lunch, and dinner"....DRINK LOTS OF WATER!

You must remember that ALL drug laws and that imposed by the Harrison act were derived and created over a prejudice.    Marijuana was associated with Mexican immigrants that were at the time considered dregs of the society. Opium was banned because of the problem the Chinese brought with them. A Heroin addict at the time did not beat the hell out of his wife nor did the marijuana smoker so they had to create ludicrous things and make up lies that these drugs did when in fact the "Legal" alcohol is by far worse. Not to mention cigarettes that kill more American's than any other single thing. Everything can be done in moderation, the Bible teaches us this. This is what seperates good from Evil. In a sense.    To make the drug ILLEGAL, the one individual that was responsible for this also (Harry Anslinger) He himself wondered while looking over the Potomac (Where Marijuana plants flourished) "And you want me to make this illegal?" His exact word's, "How in the hell am I going to make a plant illegal." Eventually he claimed the drug makes you insane and leds to heroin and cocaine.So how did they do it?     My answer; The same way Goebbels and his thugs made 70 million people think Jews were sub-human. PROPAGANDA. You can tell the American public Kinko foot pads work and they will believe it, so what do you expect?    A series of propaganda films and disseminated stuff reached the American public that smoking it could led a normal person to commit murder, to commit this and to commit that. Watch HOOKED on the History channel and it explains everything.    The fact is the drug does work and if the people that passed the laws that made marijuana illegal could have had a crystal ball and seen the damage it done to our judicial system would have never passed it.    The reality of it is, innocent people that just want to escape the frustration of normal life (why people have a beer here and there) are getting criminal charges for just wanting to feel good. These are not criminals, these are not thief's they are not rapists and the fact is our Prison's are overcrowded with innocent people and we have no room for real criminals for a law that has been obslolete ever since the day it was passed.    However addiction is a huge money maker and it is a farce. People are addicted to food, people are addicted to sex but if your are addicted to alcohol or weed you have a disease and they are trying to figure a way to make this sound sensible (Just like psycology, want to study that;just study a animal's behavior ) although we know rats will take cocaine over water any day. And this is just the way it is.So.....are these rats diseased? Explain this?    The fact is this, our system is diseased and many old school dinosuars just need to GO AWAY.|`|Qiw9AFkaaa	it is not bad; just not to be abused.|`|lByah6n7aa	Because the government makes **** worse than it seems. They want to act like weed is so bad but there are worse things out there.
htBxuF28aa	you like me but bigger lol     your shape is perfect a very top heavy hourglass  maybe a tiny bit big waist n hips but not much    im guessing chest-42 yh?|`|pJ7TUr0Haa	a bit difficult to tell from your measurements    I mean it could be just fat or mussle?    It would also be important to know if you are male or female  --------------------------------------...  I tried to and make some comparisons but I thought most ladies would not let get that close to them with a tape measure. :o)  A model may have the measurements of 33-24-35 but then they are not normal being very skinny.  So guess you sound OK to me.     Going running is very good, you are keeping fit and heathy and nicely toned with it, because it's not just the 42, 27, 37 that is important

No excercise!|`|MEOjwPCNaa	Eat lots of protein, a reasonable amount of *good* carbohydrates like oatmeal and brown rice, and lift weights! This way you will build lean muscle mass without adding fat. I'm assuming this is your goal.     You have to eat more calories than you consume in order to gain weight. It's simple math. If you do it the wrong way, of course, you'll simply get fat. There are lots of calculators online which will help you assess what you need to eat in order to achieve this.
YO1w7gpiaa	To interrupt your thoughts,  and to connect yourself with "the present" here and now,  use the process of accessing each of your 5 senses.  The psychological term is called "grounding".    Begin by closing your eyes for 3 seconds, and speaking the word "stop"  In your immediate area search with your eyes to find  -- 5 different colors  touch  -- 4 different textures  listen for  -- 3 different sounds  search with your nose  -- 2 different smells  with your tongue  -- taste a strong flavor  (peppermint, etc.)    You may also use cold water to wash your face or wrists.  This will also draw your attention to your current surroundings.    Take a few deep breaths, exhaling long and deep.    The next step is to purpose to concentrate on something new,  such as your music, something you read, to focus your mind on a different train of thought.|`|OoaZGumxaa	I know this sounds cliche but I recently took up Yoga and it's amazing for that!

Whenever my mind is running I find doing the same helps. Sometimes a good vigorous workout will chill out your mind for a bit. After you get a good burn going, stretch and focus on your breathing, telling yourself to release the chatter with each exhalation, and when you inhale, feel yourself be grounded.|`|Pzdt9MoSaa	alcohol works wonders.  but i wouldn't recommend it.|`|WvqRJow1aa	Take up a small carving project as a creative outlet.|`|JoPr4Kouaa	I learned in a breathing class when I was pregnant how to relax by looking into a burning candle in a relaxed setting. When a thought comes into your head, just ignore it and concentrate on the calm, warm and fuzzy feeling you get from the candle. Weird, I know but it works. Everyone needs 15 minutes a day of quiet time. And if you need help to sleep and not think... Lay face up, your hands down at your sides and concentrate on your toes. Imagine they are tingling. Then go on to your feet, then your shins, your calves, and so on, all the way to your head and hands and fingers. By the time you get to your arms you should be fast asleep. Good luck.|`|DZB0WCmmaa	Mmmm, I'd say music but you say no. I usually lie in the dark with eyes closed and my headphones as close as possible so that I perceive every possible background sound, as if I fly , as if I dip in a sea of sound.After an hour, I feel brand new. And I don't think during that, believe me. Somehow as if the music takes control and I just float. But the closed eyes and the dark room aslo help.    Good luck|`|8Z7tF9wuaa	if your not into it, but smoking weed.    drinking water.    writing things out.|`|2fHX3Ss2aa	deep breaths actually help.    P.S I think theres no such thing as thinking too much. Unless your about to do something, just make a decision and run with it|`|KncPJwIaaa	take long showers it works for me|`|UIDfTmbcaa	I was planning on answering just a couple quick questions before I went to bed then I see this question. I don't know of a short way of putting this. IT is a bit of a process to be able to "clear your mind" when you do a number of things may happen. You could enter nirvana which for me was an extremely colorful and euphoric state that I thoroughly was enjoying then I got to thinking about it instead of just being and had to train myself to deal with just being there because when I got to thinking about it I came back to my conscious mind and way of thinking. Another possibility is scaring the heck out of yourself. SOme people have hallucinations and other very vivid feelings both emotional and physical when meditating. Another very common thing to happen to the untrained person who is trying to meditate is that they tend to fall asleep. To begin meditating you of course should speak to your doctor. Ok got that disclaimer out of the way. I begin by systematically flexing then releasing each individual muscle in my body while breathing in slowly and exhaling slowly (about 3 to 6seconds for each inhale and exhale). Start with your feet and slowly move up to your head. After you do that SLOWLY. continue to breath in and out very slowly while counting backwards from 108. It may help in the beginning to imagine each number in your head to prevent random thoughts from invading your meditation or mind. As you breath in know for a fact that the air your breathing in are cleansing your mind and body as well as the fact that the expelled air is helping to detoxify you. Feel the breath enter each part of your body . Let yourself go. you may want to tell yourself before you begin that for the next 10 minutes you don' t need to do anything else. that for the next 10 minutes you don' t want or need to do anything and believe it. after you meditate for those 10 minutes over the next few months as you learn how to control  and let go increase it to a full hour. Imagining your happy place like a meadow full of long bladed grass with some yellow flowers and a huge willow tree in the center next to a pond may help you to reach your center.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|iYky05uIaa	Spend some time having a look at the link below, iam sure its gonna help you.|`|qZF4r71taa	One word...exercise.

You have to stick with it though, and not give up right away.|`|XfZ83sbHaa	to get started no soda drink a gallon of water a day spring or distill no tap water!! or crystal light for your meals.    Breakfast eat 3 egg whites or oatmeal and a fruit.    Lunch eat a grilled chicken breast vegetables with light oil 1 teaspoon  and a fruit.    Dinner eat a tuna or chicken salad / grilled or broil chicken breast with Mrs. Dash on it and a small cut of vegetables and a fruit.    Best snacks to eat are http://www.nabiscoworld.com/100caloriepa...    no eating after 7pm !!    do 250 sit-ups in the morning and 250 sit-ups before bed.  Do leg squats against the wall 3 sets of 20 once every other day.    Walk for 30 minutes twice a day or jog in the house for 30 minutes if the weather is bad out.  Ride a treadmill for 20-30 minutes a day and  that should do it. Make sure you do this through out  the day not all at once.

Now the question is how you can boost the fat burning.    See the very basic is to increase the RMR ( resting metabolic rate ) i.e. calories you burn during your rest time. so increasing RMR will help you boosting your calorie burning throughout the day. So you should not limit you endeavor only to cardio exercise ( like running in trade mil) but also do some multi joint weight training......    Learn how it helps boosting your metabolic rate...    http://www.effective-workout.com/fatburn...    other tips : never skip your breakfast to keep your metabolism high throughout the day, take lots of water and don't exceed your daily calorie limit.    calculate your daily calorie need....  http://www.effective-workout.com/calorie...

As long as you're reasonably well-nourished and don't suffer from some endocrine disease, you're going to reach the height that your genes dictate.    Boys and girls hit growth spurts at different times during their development. You're at the brief age where girls are typically taller than boys, but you'll notice that they will pass you up in no time.    Besides, a lot of men prefer taller women.

RjpPzbBJaa	From my research/knowledge, the majority of mental illnesses/issues (schitzophrenia, BiPolar, ADD/ADHD, etc) are genetic. I do not think there is any link between adoption and mental illess.   Depression is can be both genetic, or situation related. I would imagine if anything adoptees would have questions about who they are, and may experience depression in response to the shock of finding out the truth.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	I've done quite a bit of reading up on BPD as doctor have told me I have traits of it.  I've never come accross evidence that says there's a link between adoption and BPD.  I think it depends on the situation, many people who are adopted are perfectly happy and content.  A lot of people with BPD report that they were abused as a child though (including me) and it often stems from a bad relationship with parent/s which have caused deep-rooted problems.|`|AA10771601	It all depends on how they are raised and the kind of love they got growing up.

If your adopted you've been abanded by your biological parents so, yeah.
K7x1RHVFaa	This could be a variety of ailments.    You should start with a physical and possibly a visit to a therapist if nothing shows up.    You always have to rule out the biochemical causes of such behavior before leaping to label your behavior a mental condition.    Yes this could be ADD or it could be other things.    You need to get yourself checked out.    Good Luck.
TJrOvRVBaa	Yes very easily.  Fighters in Thailand are some of the fastest and most fit fighters.  Cause all they'll do is calisthenics (pushups, dips, pullups).

p4K2buKXaa	There are two major versions of this, though they are both essentially the same thing  One is marketed as a healthier alternative to smoking cigarettes.  The other is a Nicorette product to help you quit smoking altogether.     For the first, it is the E-Cig.  It is a battery-powered device that provides inhaled doses of nicotine by delivering a vaporized propylene glycol/nicotine solution. In addition to nicotine delivery, this vapor also provides a flavor and physical sensation similar to that of inhaled tobacco smoke, while no tobacco, smoke, or combustion is actually involved in its operation.    The electronic cigarette usually takes the form of some manner of elongated tube, though many are designed to resemble the outward appearance of real smoking products, like cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. A common design is also the "pen-style", so named for its visual resemblance to a ballpoint pen.    For more info on E-cigs, check out http://e-cig.com.    The product to help you quit is a nicotine inhalator, or inhaler as it is also known, is a plastic, cigarette - shaped device, that consists of a mouthpiece and a nicotine cartridge, which delivers nicotine when you puff or suck on it. The nicotine is released as a vapour, enters the mouth and throat area and is absorbed through the inner lining of the cheeks and lips, from where it enters the bloodstream and travels to the brain. None of the nicotine is drawn into or enters the lungs, making it much safer than smoking a cigarette.    Each nicotine cartridge contains enough nicotine for around 400 puffs. To release the equivalent amount of nicotine contained in a cigarette, you would need to puff on the inhaler about 80 times. If the smoker continually sucked on the inhaler, each cartridge would last for about 20 minutes. The recommended number of cartridges that should be used in one day is between 6 and 12 depending on how many cigarettes the smoker was used to smoking. Usually one cartridge is used in three separate 20-minute sessions.     Although your body will acquire just the right amount of nicotine that it needs to control the withdrawal symptoms from not smoking, it will not receive any of the harmful substances like tar, carbon monoxide and all the other numerous carcinogens and poisonous toxins that also enter the body when smoking a cigarette.    The nicotine inhalator is particularly useful and valuable for those smokers who miss the physical action of smoking a cigarette, as it keeps the hands busy as if you were holding and smoking a cigarette. It is actually the only form of NRT that addresses the physical side of smoking a cigarette and the addiction to nicotine.|`|yUoa678Gaa	http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6i2ui_...

uC75y83Taa	First of all, you're not crazy.  Second of all, (for the good news!) pot is not addictive.  So you are definitely not physically addicted. It's just a habit that you're done with.  I used to smoke weed for about 3 years every day, then I met my husband.  He didn't smoke, so I stopped. No withdrawal AT ALL.  So, it sounds like you are way ready to stop, so just stop and move on with your life as an artist!  How exciting!  You're gonna see that being naturally high is so much better!  I think at 27 you're realizing that you can't go on this way.

You may need help to kick your habit but it is available.|`|I0GqKJ0aaa	Well, there's nothing wrong with pot. But, you have let it control your life, so in your situation, there is something wrong with it. You're not crazy. You're just gonna have to stop smoking it for awhile. Pot should be something fun that you do every once in awhile, for a good, social, recreational time. I smoke it in moderation and I happen to be very productive, eat very healthy, work-out almost every day and get good grades. Just take a break from it for awhile. It's not addictive but sometimes people do smoke it too much. You won't have a problem NOT smoking it since it's a plant, therefore it's not like you need to go to rehab or anything. People think that pot is so bad because it's "addicting," but people also do other things that control their lives sometimes-play video games, watch porn, eat a ton, sleep-anything can be addicting if you do it too much and some stuff people can die from-I don't see any of THAT illegal.|`|zgugU4Gtaa	Won't ruin your life as bad as booze....take it from me.  However...after I quit the booze in 94 I got into bud and was pretty chronic.  and ...like you...for a number of years...  good bud too....  had only a couple of pot guys since I been in Seattle....  middle aged stoners.  Pot does tend to demotivate....  maybe it makes thinking too tangential....  can't really focus on a task...  don't really want to do stuff that's going to "bum the high":)  and...there is a law of diminishing returns when smoking everyday...  morning noon and maybe a couple of bowls at night.  marijuana does enhance experience but not when using all the time.  then it feels almost like nothing....you wonder if you are getting shI**y  bud..  My old pot guy got sick...went down to the dom at American Lake VA...  his pot dealing days are over.....  and it was too much of a hassle for me to find bud.....  since I don't drink I don't hang out in the bars where I might hook up with somebody...  and good pot guys are hard to find...  my old pot guy was regular   never out of bud...  every week like clockwork...1/8 oz and maybe if a had a few extra bucks an extra gram so I could smoke with impunity.....  haven't smoked since August.....  not worth the hassle of dealing with tweakers....  a bakers dozen is 13...a tweakers dozen is 8, at best:)  don't like my pot guys being into "something else" , like crack or booze  .  try smoking less....let a few days pass between smoking.....you will be surprised at how you get the "old high" back after you have abstained for a while...    not crazy  but like I said earlier it does tend to demotivate.....    and...I meditate...Vippasana.....  and meditation did not "click" until I had been away from bud for a while....too much tangential stream of consciousness   but booze was my big problem...  bud is nothing in comparison....  slow it down a bit.

m7JM1ntbaa	why would you think everything will be better?  if you didnt deserve life, god wouldnt of given it to you in the first place.  its a waste of life...  "if your not living on the edge your taking up to much room"  is a quote that i always will live by.  but honestly.  you cant just kill yourself because YOU want to die.  what about your family?  what are they going to think.?  and you have a child you need to bring up..  i mean your girlfriend cant do it on her own.  and well, when the child's born  you wont even give a **** about killing yourself.  you'd forget by then.  because you'll be happy about starting a family with your girlfriend.  and maybe if you get married.  that would take your mind of it too.  + if there isnt anything to kill yourself for, why ask for attention and say you want to end your life on yahoo?  i mean...  what you've said in detail  doesn't seem like a GOOD enough reason to kill yourself.  why dont you hear my life story and then come back and tell me you want to kill yourself.|`|ParFJxnSaa	The subject of suicidal thoughts/ideation is addressed in section 5, at http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris Often, such feelings result from depression, or at least this has been my own personal experience, and when you find effective treatment for this disorder, thoughts of suicide diminish, and eventually disappear. A child needs a father; those who don't often suffer as a result, and if you were to kill yourself, you remove any possibility of being able to care for that child. The economy will improve, hopefully this year, or next, by which time you should have recovered. Then, consider retraining in a trade, like plumbing, or as an electrician, etc., if you can't find a job after trying for a while.     I suggest that you view section 2, on depression (page R first), then male depression, and teen depression, at ezy build, and seek treatment, including counselling ASAP: whether this involves medication or not. Antidepressants can start becoming effective in 2 - 4 weeks, but if you decide to accept the risks and side effects, check them out first at http://www.drugs.com & http://www.rxlist.com and read the labels, and/or inserts with the medication. Only you really know the true extent of your depression, and whether you have actually made any viable plans. Be on the lookout for any worsening of your situation, immediately following antidepressant use, as advised in the literature.   Some people in the mental health field believe that, although a severely depressed person may feel suicidal, they have neither the energy, nor the planning ability to organise such an attempt. There may be a "window of opportunity", in the first couple of weeks, following antidepressant use, when the antidepressant effect has not yet begun to reach effective levels, but energy levels, and planning abilities are beginning to be restored, and it is in this time frame, particularly with young people, when the likelihood of a suicide attempt is at its highest.     Also, I am informed that most doctors tend to prescribe on the conservative side. Some people require as much as 30 times the dose of a particular medication, for it to be effective, (it shouldn't be anywhere near that margin, with antidepressants) so they tend to initially prescribe on the low side. The patient may return, saying that they were ineffective, and want to try something else, with similar results, or may seek a second opinion. So, if you begin with an antidepressant, and find it ineffective, ask whether the dosage can be increased.     Realise that it can take several weeks to begin reaching peak effectiveness; that, once commenced, antidepressants should be continued for at least 9 months, (since the average length of a depressive episode is 6 months) although a maximum of 18 months is recommended. After that time, they should be weaned off, with medical advice as to how long, to minimise withdrawal symptoms, and the situation closely monitored. Depression recurs in around 50% of cases, so be on the alert for the signs, and take early action. Neither antidepressants, nor St. John's wort should be relied on as a sole treatment for depression, but used in addition to the core treatments shown on page R, above.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Without hurting your feelings, I would like you to analyze whether you are trying to escape from the responsibilities of life.|`|luhOd3cAaa	hi,buddy    u think that if u die the prob's will go but instantly there will be extra  problems created by u. u r gf has to suffer by the thing u done ,u r child has no life without u .

If she shouts and screams let her calm down, she is most likely stressing as much as you are, if she cries comfort her and she will comfort you back.

God Bless|`|giEXhSTIaa	I'm sorry you feel this way hun, but killing yourself is never an option.  Things would not be better for it as everyone would be devastated.  First and foremost, you really need to talk to someone about how you feel. You could try your doctor, the samaritans, a trusted friend or relative. It is very important that you do this. Talking really does help, I find it always helps me feel better. Even if you are deeply depressed it can show you that there is hope. And there's always hope.  As for everything else, try to think of one problem at a time. Do you need or want to go back to school? Would you be fine without continueing education? Or could you enrol in a college? Set yourself a goal. What would you like to do with your life? You must have a dream? Something you can aim for. As for the baby, you are not alone in this. There are two of you to look after the baby and also your parents/ grandparents can all pitch in as well and help things along.  Good luck.|`|Bwosoy7jaa	First of all killing yourself is not the answer. You have to face the problems that are in front of you. If you kill yourself, then you just gave up.

I can't explain it. its a jorney u have to be willing to take for yourself. If u don't love God, learn about him and eventualy you well. It all takes time. If you gotta go through hell then go THROUGH it.

When a person is overwhelmed by the weight of their load  Their focus on life becomes clouded.    Practical solutions become outside of what the drowning person is able to grasp, and it isn't what he wants to hear.  To be delivered from the pain of the drama  becomes his focus when his "hope" disappears.    When I was "offered a bed" in a psych ward, I fought with all I had left in me.   Yes, sadly, I was standing where you stand today.  My pile of problems were more than anything I could imagine happening to one person at one time.     Fear engulfed me.  Defeated by unimaginable stress.    Since that day, I have had to get 3 of my close relatives admitted to the Psych Ward.  I had to call the cops - for their own safety - to keep them alive.  Today I understand with different eyes, and a different heart.    When a person who is stressed-out to the point where he is a danger to himself or others  (which you were, and maybe still are)  Changing their environment, giving them a few days to take a look at their life, giving them someone to talk with  can change their focus, can change their determination to die.  No, the "vacation" isn't all fun and games.   It is giving you - and your family - a break.   But it can be a "life changing" and "life saving" break.    Suicidal thinking and desires actually is a chemical problem that originates in the brain, or as you put it "problems with my head"  In a Psych Ward of a hospital, they  only have a limited number of hours to produce results.   Why do they push medications in the Psych Ward?  There are chemical substances that can assist a person's brain, improving abilities to function, to focus the mind, to make decisions, to feel or not feel emotion, to sleep, to relax their tense and worn body.      The medications are designed to interrupt the destructive path of the suicidal person.   To allow a break in their experience.  And, with the encouragement of the staff, focus on solutions and new patterns of life.  Patterns of living that can help you to choose to live, to lower your stress, and to assist your mind toward finding hope for the future.    A hospitalization is the opportunity to interrupt the hopelessness.   It is not a longtime cure.     It is the opportunity to make new choices of choosing life.  You are important - so is your girlfriend - so is your baby.  I sincerely hope you choose to "be the man" in their lives.  And I hope that you will choose a path of "life" tonight.    Hospitalization doesn't answer all the problems.  It is only an intersection of choices.  Choose HOPE.   Counseling, talking with an older and wiser person who has faced hard things in life for themself will help.  Having a "mentor" is also an encouraging experience that helped me.    And, one more thing.  I also found encouragement each week by going to Church.  They are in the business of helping people to start over again.|`|QS0l2ccPaa	i dont believe its in your head. you just have to sort things out. have you spoken to anyone close to you about this? i dont believe you really want to die...or else you already wouldve done so...but DONT! im not a religious person...but im a firm believer that God brought us into this world, and only He decides our final day here. how old are you? how are things with your girlfriend? your parents? you can contact me if you need anything else...if not me then talk to someone your comfortable with. you have a lot to live for, find the strength within you, and you can overcome any situation. my email is: mr.shy1@yahoo.com|`|af9ITvv3aa	You have no idea the kind of pain you are going to inflict onto your family, girlfriend, child if you do commit suicide.  it will kill them with pain and stress too.    please dont do it, you were given a life for a reason and it dosent need to end this way,  in 10 years time you could be sitting at the park with your child.    eventhough you are not in school you still have other options.

uC75y83Taa	What's happening is that your blood sugar gets really low.  Keep some granola bars on you.  They're really handy! You can find them at any health store, Trader Joe's, or the cereal aisle of any supermarket.  Also bananas, apples, nuts, cheese and crackers are great snacks.  You should eat every 3-4 hours, and that dizziness will go away. :)  I just read the anemic part. If you're iron anemic, didn't your doctor put you iron supplements?

If you still will feel wan to eat it, maybe you should try to eat something in your mouth oftenly to distract your attention, such as chewing gum or candy.

It has serious consequences.  Please do some research first and then decide..I am a psychologist but also work  as a teacher for many years.  I have had students that were using ritalin and believe me, the adverse effects are greater than the benefits.    I strongly recommend you to look for a friend to talk to, a psychologist, or someone that won't prescribe you medications, but to listen to you.

f4mTkxlMaa	The problem with Accutane is that it can cause Depression. The severity of the depression ranges. I used Accutane when I was 16. It worked for me but the side effects were horrendous. I suffered a minor depression but the way Accutane made me feel was even worse. I was 16 feeling like 75 yrs old. I could not move. If I bent over, I couldn't just straighten up. I didn't roll in and out of bed. But I had to gingerly get into bed and tighten my muscles up and Slowly loosening my body muscles to accommodate the bed. My friends who took Accutane developed sores around their mouths, lips.    I would be glad to know that Accutane is off the market. It worked for me but I still suffer from severe acne. The only way I found is by eating right.    I finally found a dermatologist that told me I don't need Accutane, I just need to change my diet. cut out the sugar, fried foods, chips and snacks. Eat Whole wheat, baked, grilled, veggies, fruits and water. NO DAIRY... which is very hard for me. You don't have to watch the portion control... just what was in the food.    I found out that IT WORKED! It just takes will power to keep eating like that. Which I don't have. So my acne comes and goes. But every time an acne pops up, at least it's not going to be everywhere. And I know I just need to eat right to get my skin back to normal.    I was my face with Clean and Clear face wash every night. I also moisturize my face every night, it's called the Hymed cream. It also helps heal scars. I would also dot the trouble spots with Aveeno Acne spot treatment cream.     So with the diet and moisturizing, I finally found a way to help my skin. It just takes willpower to maintain the regimen.    Within 1-2 weeks you will see that your skin will improve.    If your acne is painful, go see a dermatologist and tell them you need cortisone injections. The doc will extract the pustules and inject a shot to keep it from being infected. This will speed up the healing process.    Eat right and maintain it to keep from having the flare ups.

That will not only ease the pain, it will clean your throat of germs.     however, if your sore throats always morph into colds, nothing you can do about them will help. You need to wash your hands more, disinfect your doorknobs, telephone receivers, stop shaking hands with people and stay away from crowds. Colds are spread by viruses. Sore throats are more commonly caused by bacteria.

Hope this helps|`|1CVOHoapaa	If you are not used to exercise then the key is firstly to enjoy what you are doing and secondly to ease yourself in.  You state you are at school so you are in the ideal place to get advice.  Your school should have somebody in either the PE department or Biology/life sciences department who can advise you on nutrition. A faddy diet or exercise regime will NOT work. Get the advice.   If you begin to exercise it will also allow you to eat more of the things that you like.  The more exercise = the more calories burnt = more food intake required.  Diet wise eat healthily and remember a little of what you like will not kill you. Perhaps take it as a treat. ie If your thing is McDonald's then give yourself a treat once a week. Say at the weekend allow yourself a McDonald's if you have been good all week.  As for the exercise what do you like doing. there is no point in starting running if you do not enjoy it.  If you do not enjoy it it will become a chore and what do we do wit chores? we put them off until later!  If you enjoy netball, hockey, football, dance or anything that involves exercise join a school club and ease yourself in. Again seek advice from pe faculty staff.  Good luck.|`|ANcCxdEfaa	You have to increase your lung capacity so you can exercise longer and the only way to do that is to work your self up to the level you want to be at.  If you are tired after 2 minutes, try lowering the speed setting on the treadmill to a setting you can do for an hour.    A day or so later, increase the setting by 1 level, and keep increasing the level by 1 until you can do a higher level for an hour and get a good workout.    For your age, your maximum heart rate (MHR) is 204 beats per minute.  You need to calculate your at rest heart rate (RHR).  You do this by taking your pulse for 30 seconds while you are sitting down and completely relaxed and multiplying it by 2.    Just for kicks, let's assume your *at rest* heart rate is 80 beats per minute.  Subtract 80 from 204 and you get your target heart rate (THR) of 124 and that is how many beats per minute you want your heart pumping at to get a good workout.  If it's below this number, you would not get a good cardio workout, only a leg workout and cardio exercise is what will make you lose weight.    MHR is determined by subtracting your age from 220 (220-16 = 204)  RHR is simply how many times your heart beats per minute.  THR is your MHR - your RHR    Good luck!|`|tAXxHM4kaa	dfd|`|21YrYxelaa	i dont really know but you have to keep excercising everday even if it hurts!  go to a doctor aswell to check up on your health!    goodluck x|`|kRQlW5uNaa	About the diet- first off start eating 5-6 small meals a day.  that will kick start ur metabolism into fat-burn mode.

Extra-  Listen to music when u run! that always motivates me to keep goin. Best Running Song Ever= Cigarello by The Fratellis (puts a smile on ur face and just makes ya wanna move!)|`|1ggESF58aa	Nice job on taking the initiative.  You're not considerably overweight to begin with (if at all considered overweight), and it might be harder to lose the weight at your current stats with just some random running.  Without seeing a picture of you, but taking into consideration your height and weight, I'm guessing most of the weight you want to lose is probably in your hips and tummy, and maybe some on your arms.      I don't know what Davina Mcall's superbody workout is, but it should be aerobic exercises with light weights.  Doing aerobic excesses while incorporating lightweight training will help target the areas of your body with extra fat quicker than a non-iso exercise like running, swimming, etc.  Running is important, and you should still do it to help burn off calories.  I think it's a good routine to do your aerobic fitness in the morning and running in the evening.  Make sure to give yourself enough rest in between workouts... whether it be two days in a row working out and then one day of rest (two days on, one day off), or three days on, one day off - not resting is setting yourself up for injury.    Your diet should be designed to give you enough energy to function throughout the day with your workouts.    Edit:  I had a big old answer written out and then Yahoo Answers crapped out on me.    Anyway, I've been reading some other poeples responses and would just like to add that the nutrition is important, drinking a lot of water is important to keep you hydrated, but too much will reduce your sodium count - which is also important.  6-7 bottles of 12-16 ounces might be overdoing it unless you are putting in 2-3 hours of exercise a day.    The bottom line for nutrition and exercising is that you need energy to do it, more energy than someone who isn't exercising.  At your height, weight, and age you need about 1900 calories a day (on your exercise days) and about 1600 calories a day (on your off days) to remain healthy while losing weight.  Remaining healthy is key in an exercise program - if you are malnurished you will get sick and injured and you wont be able to exercise!  Vitamins, nutrients, and sugars from fruit and vegetables are a must, eating carbohydrates from bread and oats in the morning and at lunch is better than at night.  Protein (fish, chicken, beef) at night is a good idea too.  Check out this website to figure out how many calories you should be taking in in a day:    http://www.hikingupward.com/cal_calc.asp    Now, for your problem of running out of breath when you run, what the person said about lung capacity is true.  Your VO2, or your lungs ability to supply your body with oxygen is lower than others who are physically fit.  Your lung capacity is linked to your endurance training, and you should work on your heart rate to help you increase your cardiovascular endurance - basically your ability to exercise longer without getting short of breath.      Your heartrate without regular exercise might be within the 55-105 beats per minute range - and if you jump right into running it might shoot up to 150 bpm.  Your body isn't used to this so it doesn't know how to efficiently work at this rate.  If you set up a heart rate zone and exercise within that zone for a certain period of time, your body will become more efficient at working at that heart rate.    For example, I do heart rate training, and I will set up zones for different achievements.  I will jog for 10 minutes keeping my heartrate between 90 and 110 bpm.  Then I will run for 5 minutes keeping my HR at 110-130 bpm.  Then I will do sprint exercises for 10 minutes which keep my heart rate in the 140 - 180 bpm (sprint 25 meters, rest for 10-15 seconds, and repeat), then do the running, and finally jogging for a cooldown.  This trains my body to work more efficiently while my heart rate is increased... increased lung capacity can pump more oxygen into my blood as it moves through my body quicker.    I wouldn't suggest you use these heart rates though.  You should calculate your own zones with your current fitness level.  The zones are Recovery (60-70% of your maximum heart rate, MHR), Aerobic (70-80% MHR), Anaerobic (80-90% MHR) and your redline or VO2 Maxh zone (90-100%).    Check out this website to calculate your HR zones:  http://www.fitzones.com/members/Fitness/...    Your diet and your fitness level go hand in hand... if you want to balance or improve one, you need to do the same for the other.    A couple of tips if you decide to use this - measure your RHR immediatetly after waking (without an alarm clock or any big distractions).  This is the lowest your heart rate can be with you measuring it.  It will be aroun 60 beats per minute.  To measure it, place two fingers under your chin on your throat, move around until you feel a pulse, then count the beats for 15 seconds - multuplu by 4 and it should be your RHR.  If you can, do this for the next 3-4 mornings to get an average RHR.    Once you start exercising, you can monitor you fitness improvement by periodically checking your resting heart rate.  The more efficient your body is (or the more "fit" you are), the lower your RHR will be.  Top endurance athletes will have a RHR around 25-35 BPM!  A lower resting heart rate simply means your body is more efficient at keeping itself working while you are at rest.  It also means that you will be able to run farther and faster at a lower heart rate, which means you won't get a shortness of breath as easily as you used to.|`|TJrOvRVBaa	Of course you're going to be out of breath doing something new.  Don't over exert yourself with to much running and sprinting.  Start doing real long walks first.  You have to imagine the amount of stress all this "extra" weight puts on your ankles when running/sprinting.  Then once you start dropping more weight and feel more comfortable introduce some running or sprints which I think are more beneficial then running.    You have a good idea what to do so far.   1 Thing stay consistent please.     Doing a combination of strength training and cardio every week is your best bet.  Body transformations are a combination of good diet, training and cardio.  So read read read everything you can.

This will build your fitness up quicker than just trying to do one continuous run.    For example, you could try something like 10 x 30 second runs with 2? minutes walking in between which will give you a total workout time of 30 minutes.    Then increase the running and decrease the walking on future runs.

Have done lots of research on this topic and found that psoriasis has something to do with low stomach acid.    Here is the connection:    Low stomach acid > Not properly digested foods > The intestines swell > this leads to toxic build up in the colon > un-symptomatic aggression of immune system destroying ur own body mistaking it to be the toxins > and thus Psoriasis symptoms.    If u feel gas, bloated after eating, have any type of digestive problems, brittle nails or hair or have acid reflux I strongly feel u have low stomach acid which is causing psoriasis in ur case.    In case u do try betaine hcl supplement have it with a good probiotic supplement.    And results should come in a month. I bet.    And yeah do consult ur doctor.

I've done a lot of experimenting with myself like that to figure things out, and I'm not saying this applies to everybody. It's definetely not a quick fix but the work will follow you through life and make it better in all aspects.

I find using it in a spray bottle works very well - find one of those little travel ones or a small spritzer fill it with the toner.  Once you pat dry do this step and air dry it will help a lot!|`|f4mTkxlMaa	Large pores could be caused by stress and also diet.    What is your diet like? Candy, sugar, fried foods, chips and other snacks? Try veggies, yogurt, baked, grilled foods. Drink Water, if you don't like water try Gatorade and V8 fusion to get your daily veggie, fruit servings. Smoothies are good for your body and skin too.    Maybe you're in the sun too long using your topical treatment. When my pores start to get too large I use a heat mask to tighten up my skin.
QqY8YgGDaa	The government television in delhi in their programme 'kar bhala ' told other methods without knee replacement ,have you listened to that programme  -I will search that recording and if possible send it to you b e mail  -You can write e mails to me|`|X68nU9hdaa	Before I got arthritis, I enjoyed an active lifestyle that included swimming, walking, bicycling.. But when I started getting arthritis, everyday life became difficult. The more I walked the worse it [the arthritis pain] got, the pain was like a knife twisting inside. Sometimes my knee would give out, it just wouldn't support me. Then there was the sharp pain. Before surgery, the pain was absolutely debilitating. I was getting totally disabled. I couldn't walk. I couldn't stand. That's when I decided that I needed to do something. Once at church I met an very old friend of mine who suffered from the same pain as mine and thats when she recommended me Fly2india4health Consultants in India , my first thought about surgery in India was fear. I researched on my condition and my possible treatment options. I also spoke with the associate orthopedic surgeon with Fly2india4health Consultants who gave me educational material to help set my expectations after surgery. I was also been told that I would be up the same day as surgery and I was. The most important thing after the surgery is exercise. After surgery, I didn't have to take a lot of pain medication - maybe for 2 or 3 days. I attribute that to the skill of my surgeon. I was driving two weeks after surgery, Had I known it was going to be this easy, I would have had it done much earlier. If u need any orthopaedic care I will certainly advice you to go to Fly2india4health Consultants!    Source:  http://www.fly2india4health.com
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	The choice to go without condoms is up to you, but of course the pill isnt 100% effective, the condoms give additional protection, also bare in mind that you would need to make sure to use the pill correctly as for example if you miss a pill or are ill it wont work so condoms will be your only protection. Condoms protect against STIs so make sure the both of you get tested for STIs, if you and your partner are not long-term, if you are young or immature the fact is that its not worth the risk as all it takes is for him to cheat on you once and you could catch anything. Also remember that things such as bacterial vaginosis and urinary tract infections can be passed from partner to partner so you will need to be knowledgeable enough about your body to spot these infections and make sure to either not have sex or use protection during the time you have the infections. Id also point out that safe sex is more than just using condoms, make sure you know how to spot problems with each others sexual health, use other safe sex tools such as latex gloves or clingfilm for certain sexual activities, know that condoms are sometimes necessary for example during anal sex to protect him against infection. Its a hell of a lot to consider, its up to you what you do but make sure that you know how to care for each others sexual health in anyway and be careful as even the most seemingly loyal and loving boyfriend can cheat.     As for condoms irritating your vagina  why do they irritate your vagina and what have you done about it? Chances are you will have to use condoms again sometime so you will need to find the cause of the irritation and do something about it. Another option is femidoms they may not cause you irritation, they are also better as they conduct body heat better, he wont have to pull out after ejaculation, more comfortable for him and they protect you from more STIs than condoms do. It may be that condoms irritate you due to lack of lubrication, which is another vital safe sex tool, it may even be that condoms arent the problem but lack of lubrication and sex prior to penetration is the problem. It could be that you are allergic to certain types of condoms or brands so try different types of condoms to see if they all have this problem, particularly look at condoms that do not contain latex. Another common problem a lot of women have is an allergy to the spermicide nonoxynol-9 so watch out for condoms that do not contain this ingredient.|`|Dkg7sqxIaa	no, it would not be safe. the pill does not protect you from STI's or STD's.  Try different brands of condoms|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Its not 100% complete safe but it lowers your chance a lot more than without the pill. Its quite possible you are allergic to latex.|`|sp0JWXHFaa	As long as your on the pill and take it the same time every day its safe|`|Le9nJffgaa	I agree with the other responders. Its not 100%  that you won't get pregnant, oral contraceptives are 99% effective. But there is still that 1 %. It would be best to continue the pill and condoms to ensure your best chances of avoiding pregnancy. WIthout a condom you are potentially exposing yourself to STD or STIs, including HIV that can lead to AIDS. Try a latex free condom, they may be a bit more expensive but less expensive than a child or a lifetime treatment of herpes. Good luck with your decision!|`|FIvA9OVxaa	ya as long as he pulls out before he cums|`|aGXankr2aa	Questions to ask yourself before you stop using condoms    How long have you been with your Boyfriend?  Less than a year and you shouldn't even think about it.  Would your bf agree to having an std test before you stop using condoms?  Is your relationship exclusive, do you really trust him?    Also there are hypo allergenic condoms available, some people are allergic to latex, I know it's an embarrassing subject, but speak to your GP.|`|krZ8RJZzaa	People will tell you no, and its not completely safe, as you still aren't 100% protected against pregnancy (you never really are unless you don't have sex), and you aren't protected against STDs, but for that if you both are clean and are only sleeping with one another then you are fine.  My boyfriend and I don't use condoms, we both don't like them,I am on the pill, we are both clean, and well neither of us want a baby at the moment, I guess its a chance we are willing to take.|`|JLayHNZCaa	Nope, stds don't care if you are on the pill.  Try a different brand.|`|2ccc737caef357c3260c36ef333caaa5aa	I think you'd be very safe to go without one, as long as you are on the pill and take it according to directions.|`|exh2uAlEaa	the Pill reaches an effectiveness of over 99%, but in practice the rate is much lower. a lot of women will have an unplanned pregnancy in the first year of using the pill, without a condom    i wouldnt, just to be safe.
211wVaznaa	Those symptoms are the same for a gastrointestinal bug called giardia. My toddler and I both got it from water. Have him go to the doctor asap.|`|2k9KU3ZDaa	He needs to see a doctor ,could be his gallbladder,but for now Mylantin is good for the gas ,just keep him away from an open flame.lol|`|uKV2HqlSaa	The best thing you could do would be is to take him to see a doctor
htBxuF28aa	try eating a tonn of salad with like some rice or summthin that keeps me full up    or try eating some cereal with hot skimmed milk i dont know why but its way more filling than eating it cold lol|`|uJKTR4d2aa	You might be going to fast, which could cause you to starve.    Just a story to relate, i tried eating 1200-1400 calories and im 5'11 238 pounds. Male. I wasnt losing anything really. even with exercise.     Sunday came, party time, ate 12 large slices of pizza a hamburger IHOP omlette with hashbrowns and i didnt gain anything and actually started losing a little weight. I figured that happened cuz i wasnt eating enough.|`|QvrhmdAtaa	You would be amazed how much water does for you and is like a filler when dieting. It also is a possibility that you're dehydrating,this causes tiredness too. I had 5 children in a row and water is like a miracle cure for weight loss and an incredible energy booster. You would also do well to be seen by your doctor to make sure you're eating enough and maybe get a blood test to make sure your vitamin/nutrition level is correct. If you're breast feeding,dieting is really not best as the baby takes nutrition from what you eat as well and you actually need a bit more calories than you would just eating for 1.It is most important to see your doctor because you can tell him/her what your normal activity level is which is also a factor in your calorie intake needs.Good luck and eat right.|`|gqvvXknQaa	There are lots of healthy foods that will fill you up during the day.    Try this meal plan:    Break: 2 egg whites, 2 slices of turkey bacon, coffee and juice  Snack: Almonds (about a handful)  Lunch: Salad with grilled chicken  Snack: Fruit/Veggies  Dinner: Grilled Fish    The trick to dieting is to not let yourself ever be deprived of food. If you are hungry, have a small snack. You should also be eating 5-6 small meals per day. Drink plenty of water (should help fill you up). Also, try eating more slowly. Your brain won't tell you your full till 20 mins after you've actually had enough.|`|53uR2jbhaa	When im hungry i drink lots of water or juice to fill my stomache up and if that doesnt work eat something like salad so it will stop the hunger but is also low cal!!    good luck :D|`|I5EcFmlEaa	first forget counting calories  this is the most stupid thing ever that has come to dieticians' mind !!    calories are for energicians only    force you to eat every day at regular time (e.g. breakfast at 8am, lunch at 12am, snack at 4pm and dinner at 7pm)    then eat reasonable quantities (1 full plate) and balance your diet (min 5 different fruits and/or vegetables per day).    now exercice 30min every day.  By exercice, it can be walking, stairs, etc.  Avoid using the car if you have to travel less than 1 mile.|`|uSYo0yZdaa	I am right there with you. Trying to lose weight and hungry ALL the time!!!!!! It's horrible isn't it? Not only am I trying to ignore the rumbling stomach but I'm craving things as well. Like noodles. Caesar dressing. Duck. All the most fattening things.   I guess it's normal, just our bodies adjusting to the sudden change in what we're putting into our bodies. For me it's the sudden drop in carbs like instead of the big sandwich I once would have had, now I'm having fruit ya know? Healthier but doesn't keep me filled up for as long. Hate it.   I'll hang in there if you do. : )  Good luck.|`|ODYrypwaaa	Try adding things like fruit and veggies.  They are lower in calories and your body needs them. Pairs, apples, and broccoli have alot of Fiber in them. I also stoke up on canned veggies.  I eat the veggies first then my main meal.  Then I feel full and have eaten less calories.  Fiber can help you feel full longer.  You can also get Fiber powder that you put in your soup.  It has not taste and dissolves really well.  I add it to my soup at lunch!  Another idea is eat smaller portions more times a day.  Plus you may not be eating enough calories.  Go to sparkpeople.com and that site can help you figure out how many calories you need.|`|YVmTJVMuaa	Gabe could be right, however dont reach for the pizza yet, you dont say whats a healthy breakfast and what time you have it but sometime s your body tricks you into thinking thirst pangs are hunger.  Have nice low calorie drinks in stock like highlites and cup a soups, plus have lots of food with a high water content in them, these are usually bulky so you feel like portions arent stingy. Have loads of fresh or tinned or frozen veg as much as you want -  maybe not tons of mushy peas or sweetcorn or potatoes but most veg takes more calories to digest than fatten you up. Try writing down what you eat on a noticeboard stuck on the fridge, this will remind you when you last had something.|`|4GJIOW89aa	Try eating several low calorie things throughout the day instead of one giant meal?    Also, drink more water to fill you up, Al tot of people  mistake hunger for thirst.
y2eSnHIAaa	I have had that problem for over a week now.  I crashed last night and slept 8 hours stright.  I think a lot of people are having this problem right now.  I blame the economy.  Everyone is worried about money and their jobs right now.    If I you feel like you should really sleep right now and you can then do it.  Don't wait to later this afternoon (closer to bed time) to do it.  You might not sleep.  Personally I would just take easy and then just go to bed an hour early tonight.    Good luck!|`|QSwJM33zaa	Well, sleeping during the day wouldn't be a good idea - you wouldn't get any sleep during the night. Try distracting yourself from your problems. Entertain yourself. You could try exerting yourself and tiring yourself out. You could listen to calming music or music you like or even blues and such.|`|Md48G2g9aa	Yeah, try to wait as long as you can there's nothing wrong with crashing a couple hours early tonight just don't sleep during the day because you'll have the same problem tonight.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Stay awake until your regular bedtime, then you'll sleep really well|`|YxhrjRAuaa	You should get some tylenol PM  It really helps sounds like you can not process your day until night time when you reflect upon your whole day.  I know how it feels to go sleepless and it is horrible.  Maybe you can take one tonight early and I bet you sleep well.  Do not carry all that stress to bed with you also.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	It's a very common problem, semen is a different pH to your vagina so it can throw off your natural pH balance, particularly if your vagina is already tottering on being unhealthy, in turn this affects the normal vaginal flora  this is essentially how infections such as bacterial vaginosis come about, the bad bacteria taking over from the good bacteria. After sex it tends to be a problem as your vagina doesnt have much of a chance to adjust to the new guest so things get a little thrown off and it can take a few days for your vagina to adjust and get back to normal. Some women will find that with certain partners it is worse than with others, it may be that your current partners semen is a particular problem for you. You may want to see a doctor, nothing is wrong going by what you've said but try going a few days after sex just so you know that the smell is purely down to sex not his semen causing an infection.    a.)It may happen every time, you may find it gets worse at certain points in your cycle, its just something where youll have to wait and see.   b.)There is little you can do to avoid this other than using condoms, femidoms or getting him to pull out, obviously having good vaginal health will help so the usual rules apply such as only washing with water no soaps or sprays even so-called feminine sprays, washes or wipes, stay cool and dry, avoid tampons, avoid tight or synthetic clothing, get regular check-ups and stay clean. Be sure to pee and give your vulva a quick rinse with water after sex to flush away any bacteria and as much of the semen as possible, you can help it along by pushing down so the semen is forced out of your vagina.|`|bPHU2JKaaa	yes its becuz his sperm.|`|krZ8RJZzaa	If the smell doesn't go away, I would get it checked out.  I have never experienced this smell.|`|LydL7EN6aa	umm... maybe ur bf should go to the dr sounds like something isnt right?|`|sEFmjAJkaa	NOT SURE WHAT SMELL YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT?  WHAT DID HE THINK OF THE ODOR?  IS IT THE SPERM SMELL?      OR YOU COULD HAVE AN INFECTION..... I WOULD GO TO THE DOCTOR TODAY............ & ASK QUESTIONS.....      BRING SAMPLE OF HIS SPERM, HE MAY HAVE A WORSE INFECTION.........  & SPREAD IT TO YOU.    OH GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|ub23m7Praa	After sex you should wipe yourself off pretty well to clean yourself and that should help with smell.     And the smell is just something you will probably have to deal with.|`|PQ7E9oO2aa	you don't shower.|`|o2tPN5Geaa	make sure that you don't have some kind of infection.|`|nMzzwrtUaa	its because of the semen inside you also your body pumps a hormone to kill off the sperm as well that produces the smell if you don't want that smell don't have unprotected sex or take a shower afterwords and wash that area out.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Didnt you wash afterward? You have to bathe after if you dont want that smell...     Yes its totally normal.|`|TTogBTYxaa	You have to shower after it because it gets stale.. Theres no cure just a warm shower.. Thats what I was told x|`|37LH15KSaa	first thing: did u guys shower first? second: if u are not clean down there it will smell. the condom possibly hid the "smell" of his penis. try using douche.|`|c2e92ea2149d09e48eaba99f5f3a2f6daa	eeewwww... have your boyfriend lick it so the smell will go away|`|ptHJG2aVaa	have a shower you smelly pig

There are so many jealous people out there and people who have to make themselves feel big and important by putting others down. They have a problem you don't  Yes you are thin but it isn't unhealthy as long as you are eating three good meals a day. You don't have to change for anybody. If you are happy with your own size that is all that counts.  You sound young and will probably naturally gain some more weight. Be happy within and outside of yourself.|`|Tkr8F0bQaa	stressing for no reason.ur young,right?u have a high metabolism because ur young.flash forward-ur now 53.trust me,ur not that thin anymore.in fact,now u prolly have the opposite problem!dont stress about looks.enjoy being thin while u can,it almost never lasts wear emo or goth styles.they look best on super-slim people and u will attract pretty emo girls!.|`|crZg76Hpaa	Bro, i'm really skinny too. I wear about the same size jeans but i'm around 5,7". I used to be much skinnier about 6 months ago but that's when I started working out. Since then I've gained about 15 pounds and I feel much better generally. Start working out and eating more, but don't eat bad food; eat good foods and you should start gaining weight. You can also go on weight gainer, which is what I'm considering. Get one with creatine, it'll fill your muscles up with water apparently, people say you don't get stronger but honestly who cares because the only reason people go to the gym is to get big and looks in this world are always decieving, goodluck bro.|`|4zoN1U3Waa	Be what with what you have.Many people in the world are dealing with obesity,in USA,UK,and lately etc.Others are starving themselves to be like you.I would say let the critics and the other fun making people talk,that's all they can do.

I have always hated big bulky guys or those big muscle guys at the gym. Their physiques do not turn me on. Ive always loved the lean look on a man and the very natural look.  So if you are tall and lean, people are just jealous!!  Every woman has thier own taste and you are very lucky that you have this body type.  You probably have a very high metabolism rate as well and will never get big.  As far as working out, just do weights to maintain strenght and muscle tone but i wouldnt want to get huge.  Im sure you are very good at sports as well.      I hope this helped.  By the way, my bf has a 30 inch waste and is 6'2" and he's 51 years old.  He is so handsome for his age and has always been thin and in shape so count your blessings.
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Your body knows whens best to start your periods, it's different for everyone, if others start sooner than you it doesn't make you less mature. Your body will change with puberty, discharge, gain weight and breasts develop long before your periods as it takes time for hormones to act on your ovaries to start periods, but you should get periods within four years of those changes. You may get signs just before your period like those you'll get with all your periods as hormones affect your body, but you may not realize what they are at the time. You may get cramps which aren't pleasant but preventable, you're just as likely to get pleasant signs like feeling energetic before your periods, discharge changes too so you may notice heavier discharge or your vaginal smell will change. The white stains on your pants are discharge, all girls and women get this as it's your vagina's way of keeping clean, changes to this can be a sign of your period coming but for the most part they are a normal part of your vaginal functions not a sign of periods.     Prepare for your first period, you may feel wetter or notice blood, pink or brown discharge. Keep pads, spare underwear and clary sage oil for cramps with you, if you don't have pads at the time ask another girl or use toilet paper in your underwear. Pads are good to start with, organic or cloth pads are best, you may want to try something else later, some girls use tampons to feel grown-up but tampons are unhealthy so it's best to use menstrual cups or softcups which will also make periods easier to deal with. Record your periods and changes to discharge, periods have a rhythm so recording these things helps you understand how your body changes and predicts your next period.    Periods are as good or as bad as you make them, girls who feel good about their periods have happier periods, they also tend to learn about their periods so know best how to deal with them if they have any problems like cramps or heavy bleeding. Learn all you can now, check out sites like Scarleteen http://www.scarleteen.com and talk to your mom or leave her a note asking for books to explain things, like 'Period' by Joann Loulan & Bonnie Worthen, 'My body, my self for girls' by Lynda Madaras & Area Madaras, or something grown up like '****, a declaration of independence' by Inga Muscio. Celebrating your first period helps you feel good about your periods and celebrates your becoming a woman, it's also a good excuse to get something like a new outfit or have a sleep over, let your mom know what you want to do.|`|fcEWn0v8aa	yep u proberly are   talk to your mum if u have any questions  and carry some spare pants and pads with you just incase you start as it tends to happen with out you rearlising|`|TTogBTYxaa	I Got that for less than a year before my periods so get ready for them babe, its not nice!!

ADD:: Its true, I guess I assumed you were also working out, not just dieting.|`|FNeCDm3raa	Too much protein is bad for the body and will turn into fat if not used. Americans eat too much protein as a whole compared to other, slimmer cultures. Asians for example, have a low level of protein in their diets (just enough) and they are slim. If you aren't going to exercise and build muscle mass, that much protein is useless.    You also need many other nutrients that you will not get.    Eat healthy to kick start a diet/lifestyle change. Trade in the candy for fruit - nature's natural sugar. Good luck.

It varies from woman to woman.|`|0jm1r2lIaa	Your discharge color (if containing old blood) is usually a different color than your period, Your period color is normally dark red or just red, while the discharge (when containt blood) is brown, sometimes containing a hint of red.|`|35Kna3zKaa	Yes it's normal, but I don't have it.

Not ever woman is the same...but me and my three sisters are all like that and we all have children...don't worry...you are normal!|`|Oy8QkVDsaa	When there is only a small amount of blood, it's considered spotting.  It's still considered to be on your period until your discharge is clear again.  The period length varies depending on the woman; however,  it's common for 3 - 5 days, no longer than 7.  If you notice that it's lasting longer than this, you have an irregular period and should talk to your doctor about it.

MEd22BHMaa	CIRCUMCISED IS BETTER...  HOW CAN A USELESS ...GROSS ...FLAP OF PENIS SKIN...GIVE ME MORE ORGASMS?  SURE THEY CAN LAST LONGER...THEY CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING THROUGH THAT GROSS...EXTRA SKIN.|`|Yb99bIdnaa	Some women get sore from sex, and it's almost always from a circumcised man. One of the foreskin's main functions is to relieve friction and make sex more comfortable.    It's funny that you should talk about "how he treats u" because that does play a part! The presence or absence of a foreskin has some effect on the rhythm and type of thrusting that feels good to the guy.     There was a really interesting study on this a few years back. Women whose partners are circumcised are more likely to say they "just want sex to be over with", and that they feel "we're having separate experiences".     Women whose partners are uncircumcised identify more strongly with words like "warmth" and "mutual satisfaction". It's believed that the more natural rhythm means that both parties enjoy the same sensations, so in a way, he has an incentive to "treat her right" because it brings him more pleasure too.|`|K4zsztkRaa	I hope this answers your question.    http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/    I am a gay male, and from my exspoeriences uncircumcised is a lot better.    I was also circumcised at birth, and I am restoring my foreskin, I can tell you right now, circumcision decreases sensitivity by A LOT.  That's why circumcised guys have to thrust so dang hard.    -Connor|`|hiY7CCc7aa	Circumcised is definately better|`|EwaPHsNSaa	There was a study done in New Zealand in 2004.    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...    Male Circumcision Reduces Female Pleasure  Posted: 01/21/2004    'Female arousal disorder' blamed on circumcised penises    A New Zealand study found that reduced female arousal and fewer female orgasms may be linked to women having sex with circumcised male partners. Women reported they were about twice as likely to experience orgasm if their male partner had a foreskin.    Nine out of ten women prefer having sex with intact men, the study finds. "Presence of the movable foreskin makes a difference in foreplay, being more arousing to the female," the study says. "Most likely, reported vaginal dryness and the related clinical designation `female arousal disorder' is but a normal female response to coitus with a man with an iatrogenically [doctor caused] deficient penis."    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...    Apart from the studies though, I can tell you that I've been with both. All my partners were circumcised before I met my husband (who is intact)- and sex with my husband was just SO MUCH BETTER.|`|jOFRD9sLaa	if girls are worried about smegma. i'm not circumcised and i never get smegma. the only way i think i would get it is if i didn't shower for like 3 weeks. it really takes a while for that stuff to build up. most guys shower daily so i dont think it's really a problem.|`|pzLDXL6gaa	I've heard intact (uncircumcised) is better and there are also some studies to that effect.

It made no difference|`|cFigSdt0aa	Okay, that first girl doesn't know what she is talking about because I've been with 2 guys that were circumcised and 2 guys that weren't and I enjoyed sex much more when the guy was uncircumcised. It does feel better and not nearly as rough. So the foreskin is definetely not useless! She is clearly has no experience with being with an uncircumcised man and only going off of the common "American" stereotype of the natural penis. My preference is for uncircumcised as long as the guy keeps it clean down there.|`|GJKsizL7aa	There is a study that shows that many women get sore from having sex with a guy with a circumcised penis.    I was circumcised at birth. I have since restored my foreskin and life is good again. Sex is much better. My female partner used to get sore from sex and we needed lubricant. Now, she does not get sore and we don't need lubricant. We both enjoy sex a whole lot more.

There is a web-site called www.dailystrength.org which has a support group from other teenagers who do the same.  They can give you the love and encouragement you need.  Going to a psych ward does not help.  I have been several times not for cutting but for eating disorders and although it is not a bad environment, the social workers and doctors have not been there.  I know now that you do not want to quit, but please reach out to those who truly understand.  I think at least talking to someone else who has cut before will help.|`|Ajan02PCaa	Sleeves, long pants?

If it's somewhere around your wrist, wear bracelets and wristbands.  On your fore arm; fingerless gloves/arm warmers.  It the cut is still new I wouldn't recommend to use make up.  You could also wear sweaters/hoodies too.    Obviously you've been through alot and I understand why you would choose to go do this and I'm currently dealing with the same thing but try expressing your feelings some other way.

It is quite evident in the methods and processes that are being employed in order to accomplish this particular goal.  This is perhaps the reason why people buy new clothes or cut their hair. They improve their image and other things related to changing their appearances.    Personality goes beyond external appearance. It includes dispositions, traits, qualities, speech, and other things innate in the person.    Here are some tips in improving personality:    1.  Be interested in people. Try to discover what other people want. Know their likes, dislikes, interests, and beliefs. By doing this, you will be regarded as a person with an attractive and pleasing personality.    2. Assume that people like you. If you show the other person that you want people to talk to you, they will react to you with warmth.    3. Admit your weaknesses. Do not regard yourself as a perfect person. Just as persons have strengths, they also have their weaknesses. To improve your personality, you should admit that you also have defects.    4. Admire your friends. Praise them for their achievements. Tell them how attractive they look. Make them feel how important they are to you.  By this, they will also give importance.    5.  Associate with people who are successful and happy. Seek the companionship of others who can give you new points of views, renewed hopes, and meaningful life.  Ask for their advice and guidance. They can give you valuable insights about their experiences in life. You can learn from their insights and apply their insights to improving your personality.    6. Attend social gatherings. Social gatherings can increase your circle of friends.  Social events can likewise give you new insights and experiences.  It can help improve your relationships with other people and your community.  Social gatherings can help you develop your communication skills.    7. Change your environment.  Go on vacation or rest in a new place.  Renovate your house and fix your furniture.  Introduce changes in your environment.    8. Learn new things. Learn how to cook or play the piano. Enroll in voice lessons. Indulge in gardening.  By doing this, you are expanding your horizons.  Aside from this, you can also develop your skills in other areas such as public speaking and understanding other peoples attitudes and beliefs.    Improving your personality takes a lot of work and dedication.  While it may take a lot of work, it can be worthwhile and fun because you are focusing your attention on improving relationships with others and yourself.|`|f757ce8d8c9cc22eb2e7163ea2ef4196aa	it takes alot of work . for me i decided to make a list of things i wanted to change and chose 1 thing from the list. then i made it my mission to self talk myself into changing it. say i was impatient and wanted to calm down. every time i would get impatient i would catch myself and just breath. eventual i did it with out thinking and was much calmer. its all about self talk. i deserve this. its ok i failed ill do better next time. im a good person. stuff like that.|`|WkIPKqlNaa	learn life skills

Keep a diary to write down all your nastiest thoughts so that you don't have to carry them around with you to eat away at you.  Keep a list of the good things in your life and try to remind yourself everyday of the small joys in life.  Be cautious when your baby is born.

ouzrDPaSaa	You could go to your nearest pharmacy and ask for some anti-histamine based sleep-aid tablets.  They make you feel drowsy so help you fall into a deep sleep.    Dont do anything which stimulates your mind before bed, like watching tv or playing computer games.  Have a nice, hot bath and read a book once you're in bed.  If it's a dry, factual book that's even better!    Avoid drinking things that contain caffeine during the day, and make sure you get enough excercise so you're tired out when it comes to bed.  Even going for a short walk can make a difference.    If nothing works then you should make an appointment with your doctor and explain the situation.

I can't recall the name of it now, but if you go to a search engine and type in "sleep disorders" you will find references to it.    Good luck.  Please check with your local doctor for more information.|`|jnEdjmsTaa	yeah, happens to me too.  it's usually pretty rough, but what i usually do is stay up that day.  like don't go to sleep at 4, and don't take a nap later in the day.  by the following night you're ready to sleep early and get back into a good cycle.  til you fall out again.  but anyway, staying up definitely works if you can make it through the day.|`|89fc809291d1b95a8d32164fe467ae3baa	You could see a doctor, but unless is something really wrong with you, like a disease or a disroder, then you will probably end up taking addictive medication. So.   I suggest, no eating 2 hours before bedtime. No watching TV, internet or anything that excites you before bedtime. Have just a cup of warm tea or milk.   Buy one of those "spa alarm clocks" that have soothing sounds to make you fall asleep.   Have your room completely dark.  And be patient.   Also, don't eat too much sugar or fats because this stresses your body a lot.   Good luck.
OJNBYgenaa	It's called a congenital pit (of the Cymba Conchae). It's not terribly uncommon. People often complain of leakage, and smell, and congenital pit is hereditary, which would explain the family history.|`|NeymQe9raa	is it like, the part where your ear meets your head?(the flat part?)

5LR1RZelaa	When your skin is damaged (repeatedly rubbed, burned, etc) the blood vessels get wider and let fluid in.  The fluid makes your skin bubble up and form a blister.  How long they take to heal depends on how big and serious of a bluister it is.|`|xRZnJAzlaa	it depends on the seriousness of the blister.. applying oil makes it heal faster ,like about a week, if its not serious.|`|LWG3l9Liaa	a blister takes about a  week to heal.
xDOp37T7aa	The longer you take SSRIs, the worse the zaps will be. Ask your doctor for opioids to off set the zaps, and suggest he change the therapy such that you stop taking SSRIs completely. Opioid addiction is nothing compared to side effects of SSRIs|`|53b873dc19210bd9e4fae22faf08dc69aa	When I started on Paxil one of the side effects was the zapping.  However, for me they did go away after a couple weeks of being on it.|`|hH6TAtnFaa	Zaps can be a side effect of some anti-depressants (although they don't seem to be included on official literature).  I had them while I was on Effexor but I haven't had any since i switched to prozac.  tell your doctor because it may be that your meds are messing up your seratonin levels too much.
h1lDGNp4aa	Regina, your avatar is so sad!  Unfortunately no.  Having been on anti-depressants for about 20 years now I would think that if the Prozac was going to work that it would have kicked in by now.  Give his office a call and tell the receptionist that you are fearful because of your feelings and can he up the dosage NOW.  Hopefully, he is increasing the dosage just as soon/fast as he can.  I'm not sure but I think Costco has a program where you pay very little for drugs if you have no insurance; ask the pharmacist.    Also, ask you doctor if he has considered bi-polar disorder.  If so, you would need something in addition to Prozac.      A very inexpensive drug to take at night which is both an anti-depressant and a sleep aid is Trazodone; it's under $10.    My thoughts will be with you; hang in there.|`|xDOp37T7aa	What kind of doctor or therapist did you get this nasty SNRI from?|`|2NzCS7ALaa	YOU KNOW WHAT WORKS LIKE YOU WOULDN'T IMAGINE!!! JESUS CHRIST!!!! HE WILL TAKE THAT DEPRESSION AWAY GIRL FRIEND! START LIVIN!|`|89fc809291d1b95a8d32164fe467ae3baa	I was on antidepressants and it was hell for me. None of them worked and they only made me feel worse about myself. So I did behavioral therapy for three years and I improved a lot. Sometimes it might be hormonal imbalance, or a thyroid problem. Keep trying to discover why you are feeling depressed.   I firmly believe that medication for depression only covers the problem with a layer that makes you "forget" why you are depressed. You have to face your depression and tackle it with your 5 senses. Specially when is a depression that comes from a situation in your life. (my opinion, and I'm no doctor)  But....if you do have a physical problem, and by that I mean that you have no obvious reason to be depressed, then try to see other kinds of doctors like endocrinologists or neurologists.    I forgot....I wanted to tell you that, whenever you find a moment when you are not at your lowest point, write on a big board: "When I feel like I don't want to live anymore, is the depression talking, is not me, I really don't want to harm myself".............It sounds silly, but it reminds you that that voice inside of you is not really you...is the disease....

yOK32PM9aa	It is important to realise that after someone dies, the relatives will be very stressed.  It is perfectly natural, it happens to everyone in that situation.  But it passes.  It seems as if it will go on forever, but gradually it gets better.    The process can be helped by talking it through with someone she trusts.  Just remembering the good times in that person's life is very useful.  If things get very bad, you should persuade her to go to the doctor to get some short-term help.  You can also help by making sure you do little things to look after her and show your affection.|`|xRZnJAzlaa	is she scared.? i think she may need time to adjust, because it  doesn't sound like stress to me..|`|89fc809291d1b95a8d32164fe467ae3baa	She needs to talk to someone, a therapist maybe, so she can grieve properly. She might need some medication for anxiety.
BLD9EEWNaa	You sound bi-polar.  I'd be very surprised if you turned out to be schizophrenic (I'd know, I'm schizo), because paranoia is one thing, but what does it revolve around?  Government conspiracies, or more like anxiety?  By the way, its a common misconception that bi-polar disorder isn't that bad.  It can be very bad, even with psychotic elements and paranoia, etc...  But don't try to diagnose yourself (or let anyone else who isn't qualified)- go to a psychiatrist with an open mind and instead of rattling off symptoms like some people do, just tell him/her exactly what's going through your mind.  And go to a school counselor- they can recommend to your mother that you see a psychiatrist, who can in turn recommend medication.|`|maCpSMGqaa	Talk to your counselor at school.|`|3b5756f678ae58231133ed532fe66616aa	Sorry to hear about how you're feeling, but no one on the internet can truthfully and correctly diagnose you. If I were you, I would ask your parents to take you to a therapist, and have a few sessions to see where the problems could be coming from, and how to deal with them.    I know it's tough, I've felt the same way as you before and I can relate. Get well soon. :-)|`|qt4Shm2caa	dude, i feel the same way and i havent been to a doctor for the same reason your mom isnt taking you to one... id never wanna end up taking those nasty drugs|`|U8gIdoXFaa	You dont have to be completely messed up to have bi polar.  It does sound like you may have a mild to maybe moderate form of it. I dont think you are schizophrenic. Schizophrenics dont know that they are deluded. I  dont believe for a second that the drugs are the cause of your problems, but if you are bi polar, (or have any mental  disorder for that matter)  drugs will make it all so much worse.    I hope you are able to see a doctor about this. Any sort of depression is difficult to deal with and bi polar is especially tough because of the ups and downs. If it is bi polar you will be encouraged to take meds but not forced obviously. I understand your mothers concerns about meds but I think you are right in that it may be your only choice. The most important thing to remember when on meds is to stay on them, and the next most important thing is to have counselling or someone you can talk  to who truly understand your problem. Pills can only do so much. They numb the pain basically but it is still there underneath. Knowing you have support from friends, family and counsellors can make all the difference.    I think all of this is going to be difficult for your mum. It might help if you ask her to come to the doctor with you. Whatever you do you must make it clear to her that you need support. You mentioned suicidal thoughts. You must discuss this with her so that she is very aware of how low you can get.    Take care dear. Good luck with it all.|`|e6ZV3mgNaa	Go through Bible, and believe me, it works. Jesus Loves you very much!!!

Vcte2eUtaa	I'm not surprised, many old people wait to die after e.g. a grandchild has been born, after a relative came back after being years abroad etc.    Death has not always a physical explainable reason !    In some old cultures people could end their life by meditating or just stop breathing. Modern cultures with their often limited imagination and cultural knowledge use to give everything a physical reason, maybe just because they can't accept not to understand things.    So also intense depression can ofcourse be a reason to die by natural way !    (guess they get laid down on a quiet place when they feel the end has come, people who know they will die usually are very bright minded)|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Not applicable.|`|qxddYXMGaa	You cant its impossible.

A really depressed person could be in a number of situations where she doesn't commit suicide but indirectly ends up hurting herself to the point of death.|`|XATJQXwgaa	people can die by losing the will to live, some starve because they no longer eat, and some die from lack of sleep as their depression keeps them awake. Further suicide is caused by depression, if they were not depressed they would not do it, so one could say that depression is most certainly fatal. But yeah, losing the will to live is a big one, even if its seems little.

UwiGwDGdaa	Starving yourself won't make you lose weight.   When you do eat, your body will store every single calorie it can because it's in "famine" mode, meaning the body knows it needs to retain all the calories consumed because there will be none later. This can result in weight gain.  Not only that, when you do starve yourself, your body will lose muscle, organ, and brain tissue first because it's the most nutrient dense items in your body. Your cells will eat the important tissues and save the fat cells for later, so the weight you actually lose will be from organs...not fat.     You can look forward to several things because of starvation:  1) Depression, irritability, unable to concentrate  2) Insomnia or hypersomnia   3) Incontinence - you'd better invest in some diapers because you'll lose bladder and bowel control   4) Electrolyte imbalance - prepare for that pacemaker, because electrolyte imbalance can lead to....  5) Heart failure and/or cardiac arrest  6) Loss of memory, poor academic performance  7) And, greatest of all, death.     There is no "starving in a certain way." Don't let sheer vanity risk your health - instead, invest in a health book that teaches you about good nutrition and maintaining a healthy weight.    Besides, have you even gone to the doctor to see if you need to lose weight? What you see on TV isn't healthy, so stop letting the media dictate what a person should look like - newsflash, the majority of what you see is FAKE. Even the stars don't look like what you see in magazines and movies.     So, instead, grow up, see a doctor, and if you need to lose weight, do it intelligently.|`|cGnIZ7kfaa	no. just go low carb and low fat and keep exerciising and onli drionk water|`|F8EnH6JQaa	Fruits and Veggies    I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water.

Starvation and skipping berakfast will only mess up your metabolism and make you gain even more weight!! you can chack that wherever you want, cause its scientifically proven!!  instead of skipping breakfast have something light and rich in fibres such as oats, fruits or milk. for lunch, you should have proteins (fish, meat, chicken), veggies or black rice/pasta. you should also add all kinds of nuts and seeds in your diet cause they contain monounsturated fatty acids (MUFAs) which work againsta the belly fat!    enjoy your meals but keep them healthy, frequent and moderate!|`|4m8tTmlSaa	Haha so you get so fat by never stopping eating and then you think you can starve yourself?

Actually, you may find that your body stores extra fat because it is so long bewteen meals.  The best way to lost weight is 3-6 balanced meals a day, and lots of regular exercise.  Also, drink lots of water.  DO NOT STARVE YOURSELF.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It is best, if you are taking the pills for birth control to continue with the current pack, as this is just break through bleeding, which sometimes happens on bc pills.  You should still have a regular period when you end the active pills.  If you stop now, you will get your period, but will have to start all over again when that is done, and use other protection from now through 7 days into the new ones.  If you continue to break through on this brand, contact  your doctor because you may need to try a different bc pill.    best wishes..|`|5zTI9G3Taa	If you are not sexually active or have been active but used another method of protection then your best bet is to stop the pack now. Sometimes your periods can get out of sync, if you carry on the pack you will most likely have a light period that lasts until you stop taking the pill as you put your body in a kind of limbo - not able to have a full period but not able to not have one, if that makes sense. You may also find that this happens again next month as you are not properly in sync with the pill cycle.     If you come off the pack now, have your period as normal and then when it has finished immediately start a new pack you should find that your cycle sorts itself out. If however this continues to happen you should go back to your doctor as this pill may not be suitable for you or there may be an underlying problem.    If however you have been sexually active within the last 7 days and have not used another method of birth control then you should continue to take the pills in this pack as if you stop it now then you are at risk of becoming pregnant.|`|ARmhMq5laa	keep on taking them like normal,periods can be weird.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Keep taking it like normal. Mine used to be the same, it can get screwed up if there are other girls living with you.. all the girls in the house willl slowly start to sync up. So whenever I got my period I'd stop and take a week off the pills and then start a new pack. My doctor yelled at me because it can throw off your ovulation cycle and you can actually be ovulating at an unexpected time, like on your period, which can then lead to the P word (pregnancy!)... I had the problem where i'd get it early and it would continue through until I started the new pack, sometimes 2 or 3 weeks... Good luck though, and make sure you talk to your doctor and use backup if you plan to adjust so you know when your ovulating!

If you quit once, you can definitely do it again!|`|AA10561878	It's called addiction.|`|NTln9ULUaa	It all depends on how and why u stopped smoking in the first place. Smoking is an addiction, not a habit, not a stress reliever, not something that keeps you occupied if you are bored.     I quit smoking 12 years ago the moment i found out i was pregnant. I started smoking again 6 years later. I am tired of the addiction and how a cigarette runs my life. My cousin successfully quit while reading a book. Allan Carr's "the easy way to stop smoking". Mr. Carr recommends for a smoker to continue smoking while reading the book. By the time you finish reading the book you will be a non-smoker! It sounds hysterical and ludicrous but it works. I have been a non-smoker now for 2 weeks.    Basically you re-think why you smoke, and what it does for you. It costs less than $20 and is well worth it considering 3 packs of cigarettes will cost you more.    Ellen Degeneres successfully quit smoking while using the book.    Don't get down on yourself. You've admitted there is an issue. Now you just need to take all the brain washing that has been fed into you all these years and try again.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	I don't think that you are pregnant and the period you had from Jan 2 to the 9th was probably just a period.  You didn't get a good start until about the 5th, so your period would have due about Feb. 2, so you are just a couple of days late.  You haven't had unprotected sex, so probably are not pregnant and the stress and worry are making you late.  Try to not worry until you have something to worry about and it will probably come.    best wishes..

I deal with phobic patients and many report childhood bad experiences at the dentist (not being numb, etc).  When my 15 year old was little (about 5), she needed some work on a malformed tooth.  She was very worried and anxious, so I used the gas on her.  She relaxed for he whole visit and said "that was fun."  Try the gas|`|f9sL3WgQaa	No not at all.

I don't have insurance, and there are several reasonable payment plans that they can set you up with so that you don't have to go without dental care.  They also offer coupon specials on their website for free exams and x-rays which normally you would need to pay for.      It sounds like you may need a root canal or extraction, which can be costly, but make sure you ask about discounts and payment plans.      There are several locations in Minnesota, so check the link below to see if there are any near you.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Jake,    It could just be a hard piece of mucus that has come down from the back of your nose.    Have you tries swallowing something hard and rough like toast to see if that gets rid of it?    Alternatively have you eaten anything really hot which could have blistered the back of your tongue?    If it doesn't do away in a day or so it might be an idea to see your doctor or practice nurse who will be able to see down and discover what it is and therefore how best to remove it.    Sorry I can't be more helpful but I know irritating it can be. Good luck anyway with getting rid of it.    Love Mel.X

It just happens.  My step-daughter sadly lost a little boy a year ago, very, very sad as he was 24 weeks when they found a problem and she went into labour spontaneously - taking the awful decision away from her.  Last month she gave birth to a beatutiful, healthy baby girl.  Don't despair, now is a dark time for you but believe me, you will recover and hold this child in your heart forever - and then you can move on and have another baby.  I wish you all the very best.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	Sometimes nature just causes a fetus to be developed incorrectly.  Perhaps the egg was not developed or some of the gene pairs were not matched correct, it just happens and I am sure it was nothing that you did wrong.  This baby will probably not carry to term, as nature has a way of taking care of these situations, but if I were you I would choose the abortion, which would be easier for you in the long run.

Y4ogWjHOaa	Hi Carole,    That isn't high! I wish mine was that normal!    Your diastolic (lower figure) is only just reaching the top end of normal. Anything between 60 - 90 is considered normal and even if you saw a doctor he wouldn't do anything about your reading.     If you want to reduce your BP just cut down (or preferably out) salt. Drink plenty of water and eat healthily.    Your reading is absolutely fine so no more worrying.    Love Mel.X|`|gMHwrbRlaa	103/86 means a pulse pressure of only 103 - 86 = 17. That is not possible. You would be dead.|`|AA10561878	where did you get your info from ? that's a near perfect reading.|`|kxyR9e57aa	I disagree with portions both of the first two answers already posted.  The current recommendation is that diastolic blood pressure should not be more than 80, and the systolic blood pressure should not be more than 130.  The systolic blood pressure is the highest pressure in the arteries with the heartbeat, and the diastolic blood pressure is the lowest blood pressure in the arteries just before the next heartbeat.  The difference is the pulse pressure, and your pulse pressure is very narrow, with a difference of only 17 between the systolic and diastolic blood pressures.  So the logical question here is whether this is only one reading, or are you getting the same results from multiple readings?  The reading of blood pressures is subject to so many factors that whole books have been written on just that one topic.  It would be best for you to check your blood pressure over a period of time and in a variety of settings, and keep a record of your readings over a period of time, say a few weeks.  I suspect yo will find your blood pressure is not consistently 103/86, but something more typical.  I would be happy to hear from you about what you find.

Is there a real problem you must deal with, or is it more vague?    It helps to make a firm decision on any pending problem, You can always consider new information if it comes in later.  Just making the decision can pretty much eliminate the stress feelings.      General tendency to anxiety and stress may require deeper thinking about the onset of the behavior.  You may be able to do it yourself, but consider counseling.      By the way, the best proven stress reliever is exercise and physical activity.  Get a daily workout, and feel better.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|HynUWGHcaa	exercies that make your abs better|`|gSwobfujaa	eat healthy and exercise. good luck|`|zdO16ELnaa	BUY A WII AND GET WII FIT IT HELPED ME LOSE 11 POUNDS IN 3 MONTHS|`|zTiaGyuMaa	Exercise and eat about 1,000 calories a day I would walk or run for 30 minutes a day.

I  used to never eat breakfast but I have been, and i really think it makes a HUGE difference.     as for exercise try to do cardio a minimum of 3 days a week. obviously if you do cardio for a longer period and more days a week its much more effective. if you go to the gym the stairmaster is great!  also use weights but don't workout the same body part with weights everyday. if you decide to workout arms today, then you could do legs the next day and arms again after that.   i've been using this 8 minute abs video on youtube. there's also an 8 minute arms video & 8 minute buns video. i don't know how well they work yet because i just started doing them.    goodluck on your weightloss!!!!|`|xde0uuuBaa	Do an hour of cardio everyday.|`|NwcQDWmNaa	do 100 crunches everyday for a few months, and try some yoga.

The shaking could be a disease, for example parkinsons.  It could be hereditory, do any family members have the same problem?

I think a lot of people sabotage a good thing when they finally get it because they feel like they don't deserve it for some reason.  You may want to start a journal or talk to a close friend, clergy or counselor about what you're going through and feeling.  You deserve to be happy.|`|HlaEUb3Uaa	This comes from something.  It's not normal, but people do it all the time.  Giving yourself away to someone, opening up and letting them in is really scary.  The way you are raised makes all the difference in how you can socialize with people.  Since you're a closed person it can be hard to even ask for help.  You need it, you seriously must talk about this with someone.  When it comes to love people can be scared.  More so than they realize.  I've been in bad and good relationships.  After my first it was hard to give in.  Open up and giving everything away again.  It's hard because more times than not you end up hurt.  "I love you"  means nothing to some people and everything to others.  Everyone deserves to be loved.  You have to remind yourself of that when you start feeling down.  It may also be the fact that you are not actually in love.  Maybe you haven't found that guy that takes your breath away.  Keep looking, and don't give up, eventually a special guy will come your way and YOU will fall in love.  It could simply be that you don't feel the same and love is not an easy word to throw around for you.  You have to feel it to know it and you'll know it when its right.  It's easy for people on here to tell you how to change but it's more difficult for you when your caught in that spiral.

qnD5RfbPaa	To effectively loose weight and keep healthy at the same time involves a few basic steps.  First of all your diet must be one that is balanced and that you can maintain.  A balanced diet is one that will enable you to acquire your goals and at the same time keep you in good health - a diet that will maintain your required pH level.  It follows then that the 4 basic nutrients should be involved in its proper balance. These are carbohydrates, fats, protein and water.    Your carbohydrates cover fruits, vegetables and starchy foods.  For proper balance 60% of your diet should be of vegetables, of which 50% should be eaten raw.  Vegetables include broccoli, parsley, celery, cabbage, lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, carrots, cauliflower, watercress spinach etc., are high in essential fat soluble vitamins, fibers, and some amount of minerals.  You should have a very wide variety of vegetables.    Fruits should be approximately 20% of your diet and are also rich in fiber as well as water soluble vitamins.  You should also eat a vary wide variety of fruits.      Approximately 10% of your diet should be of complex starchy carbohydrates such a yam, potatoes, pumpkin, daheen, green banana, cassava etc.  These are low in calories and also carry other essential nutrients required for good health.  Also these are high in fiber and are essential for energizing the brain cells.  You should however avoid simple carbohydrates such as pastries, sweets, pastas and all processed foods.  These are usually high in calories and contribute very little or nothing to your health. Polished rice for example has been stripped of all its B vitamins.     Fats including saturated fats, are very important for the formation of hormones including those that are necessary for food metabolism.  Fats are required for most essential body function.  It therefore means one does not do justice to ones health by stripping all fats from their proteins.    Protein should be 10% of your diet.  It should take the form of meats, fish and other sea foods, nuts, seeds, peas beans, grains, eggs, milk and other dairy products etc.  Because proteins are harder to digest, it uses up more energy.  Vary your proteins.    Water is essential for proper food metabolism as well as for the removal of bulk from your system.  It is important to have 8 - 10 glasses of water per day.  It also helps to keep you full.    It is important that you vary your meals - meaning you do not eat the same thing at every meal or every day.  Also you need to fill your stomach at each meal and so it will be easier to stick to 3 meals per day.  Because most of your diet (more than 80%) will be of mainly high fiber foods, (fiber is not broken down by human digestive system, but important for forming bulk for free bowel movement) then it will be unlikely for you to increase in weight and more likely for you to loose weight.  Also the variation of your meals enhances the reduction of weight.

If you have a weight problem, chances are you also have a problem with regular exercise. That's probably because you tried to do too much. Just commit to 15 minutes a day. That's not hard at all. And don't do anything intense, especially for the first month. Take it easy -- do a few crunches, a few push ups, jog in place for a few minutes. If you do this every day, you'll burn 100-150 calories, depending on your size and metabolism.      ?  Replace a fatty snack with veggies. Potato chips, fries, anything that's greasy -- those are laden with calories. Fat is the most calorie-filled food type there is. If you eat a snack like this every day, replace it with cut-up carrots, broccoli, celery, or a salad (with low-fat dressing, not anything fatty).      ?  Have sex daily. One of the best exercises there is. Of course, you'll need to do it beyond your usual three minutes. If you can get 15 minutes of sex in a day, you can burn 150 calories. You also might need to find a willing partner. The exercise in the item above might help with that.

A munching that cannot be satisfied by anything so you tend to overeat everything.    My solution to this problem is to portion out any sweet or candy bar or whatever.

Atkins has carbohydrate gram counting booklets on most grocery shelves where they have their magazines. Invest in one of these and use it til you figure out the amounts of carbohydrate you can get away with and how much is in each food.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Well normally when aroused the vagina goes through changes such as relaxing muscles, doubling in size, various areas of the vagina and vulva become erect and of course you get lubrication, however that lubrication can be effected by different things such as hormones so during certain times in her cycle or if she uses hormonal birth control she may get dry. Then there is the more general problem of air drying out vaginal fluids and lubrication, thus why lubricant is such a vital part of safe sex as it keeps the vagina moist, preventing irritation and vaginal splitting which arent just painful but puts her at greater risk of vaginal infections and STIs  long and short of that lecture is get lube. As well as helping the both of you during hand jobs and sex, a few drops inside a condom will improve feel, try different lubes but remember oil-based will damage condoms and silicone-based will damage silicone, use different lubes to see what works best, its a good excuse for lots of sex too :o)     Why does it matter if she had an orgasm or not? Sex isnt a race to get to the finishing line, orgasm isnt the be all and end all of it, often sex is all the more enjoyable when you dont reach orgasm and there have been sexual and mystic teachings for millennia teaching people how to avoid orgasm for better sex. She had a good time which is all that matters, she may have reached orgasm in which case it is possible without her being wet, normally you would have lubrication from her vagina and ejaculate from her urethra during orgasm, but it is possible for women to have dry orgasms just as its possible for men to have dry orgasms. With what you were doing its normal for the vaginal fluids to dry up, that doesnt stop orgasms though.|`|xhjSPd0uaa	yep all girls are different, some actually make the sheets wet but others (like me) just get abit wet, even when im reallly horny or when ive come!  it is also linked to how well hydrated she is, if a girls dehydrated she'd be alot dryer down there! x|`|LgOOYyXIaa	well if she was sore like you said, then that's prob y she wasnt w**|`|2rCZbaEIaa	i dunno, i usually do get wet and then dry afterwards  (long sex sessions KILL me)  but suggestion....try playing with the clit if she gets dry or sore inside.

PeNT1RzBaa	My general understanding is that the actual microwaving has nothing to do with making things unhealthy, unless you are keeping things in styrofoam while its cooking, then you may have a problem.  The issue I see is that most foods prepared fo the microwave have tons of sodium and preservatives in them as some of these items are able to go years in the freezer and still cook well.  I'm doing my best to keep that kind of thing out of my body so I try to avoid the meals like that.  simply reheating leftover turkey or chicken or something though is not doing any harm to the food.|`|ANcCxdEfaa	Microwaves just heat food up.

If that doesn't help and it is getting worse, go to your doctor for some antibiotics.|`|mAp90hEeaa	First, to prevent this from happening again, you need to stop cutting them so short in the corners because this is what causes this in the first place.  Next, once you do get an infection, soaking them daily in warm to hot water for 20 minutes minimum then gently pulling the skin away from the edge of the nail will release the infection and allow the pus to come out.  You have to do this until it is healed.  If it gets worse and worse, you will have to see your doctor for an antibiotic.

e60910afcb632aae09c5ff7f00635a4aaa	No long term side effects have been discovered.  The sensitive tooth formulations use the ingredient potassium nitrate to help with the sensitivity.  Over the course of about 3 weeks of use, the anesthetic properties are at full force.  I have patients that have used it for decades.  The tube tells you to see a dentist if it doesn't respond in 3 weeks.  This is just  a liability statement so that people don't treat teeth with cavities with just the paste|`|RXI8ImdIaa	I think the way it works is the toothpaste temporarily fills in the microscopic pores in your enamel.    The idea is that people with sensitive teeth usually have teeth that are more porous than normal, so hot and cold liquids, acidic foods and that sort of thing penetrate more easily.     So the toothpaste closes up those pores for a short time.    (dentists, correct me if I'm wrong.)
ufgv7oTjaa	There's not an actual "RDA" (meaning it's not a nutrient that's required to live), but it's commonly recommended anywhere between 200 and 500 mg daily (sometimes more), mostly depending on medical conditions, needs, and the formulation being sold. 360 mg is a general standard (3 regular 1,000 mg fish oil pills per day), so taking that would be a good place to start if you don't have a doctor that knows about supplements.  The formula I take gives me 600 mg of EPA and 400 mg of DHA per day, but there are many good formulas out there as well. Good luck and I hope I helped!

Also if you have an ab roller and do leg raises 4 sets of 30.    If your looking for the ultimate ab routine, this is the routine that will help give you the six or eight pack that your looking for.    Items Needed  The following items needed for this routine include an ab roller and preferably ten minutes a day.    Instructions  First lay flat on the floor with your head on the head rest of the ab roller, then slowly semi crunch for 300 reps.    Then you will put your feat straight up in the air with your lower back laying flat on the floor, with your head still positioned on the head rest of the ab roller.     While positioned this way you will then proceed to do 300 reps which will work the lower abs.    You will then turn on your right side with your head still positioned on the head rest of the ab roller and do 300 reps. Then you will lay on your opposite side repeating the process you have performed on your right side, repeating the same amount of reps.     You will need to do this every day for a total of ten minutes a day for about six to eight weeks.

It should look like someone has punched you in the stomach. Don't bend other parts of your body just your stomach. It might sound painful but it is a great workout for that area.    Well done for losing so much weight (round of applause for you!!!) why not try belly dancing? It is good for toning that mid section.|`|9Sgx4Vl4aa	You've made great progress so far, so well done for that. The problem you have is very common among people on weight loss programs. Stomach fat is about the most hated fat of all by people looking to rid themselves of it.    Your diet is working well. So are your exercises, except that with exercise generally, such as walking and running, they don't necessarily target fat in specific areas. But there are exercises that do, and for stomach fat here are three exercises that will definitely help you.    1. Sit ups. I take it you know how to do these. If you're not used to doing anything like this then start gradually. Just do a few to start with. Try and do some three times a day. You don't need expensive equipment or to join a gym. If you can't get someone to sit on your feet while you do them, hook your legs under a heavy piece of furniture.    Gradually increase the number you do, so after a while you are doing perhaps 20 or more at a time. Obviously the more you do the more effective this exercise will be at getting rid of your stomach fat, but remember not to overdo it at first or you'll strain a muscle and put yourself back a week or two.    2. Trunk circles. Stand feet comfortably apart for balance, hands clasped behind head, and swing your upper body around in as big a circle as you can, first one way, then the other. Again, don't overdo it at first, but when you're confident enough you can do anything up to 50 circles or more at a time.    This exercise is great for stretching and toning the stomach muscles, and will help get rid of that unwanted fat. Try and do this two to three times a day.    3. Isometric exercises for the stomach muscles. These involve tensing a set of muscles by using them against either another set of muscles or an immovable object. Each exercise lasts only around 7 or 8 seconds, and you breath in for a couple of seconds and exhale for the remaining 5 or 6 seconds.    For the stomach, a particularly effective isometric exercise is to place your hands against a wall and act like you're trying to push it over. Or you could simply stand upright and pull in and hold the stomach as far as it will go for 7 or 8 seconds, as if you're trying to get your trousers to fall down.    This is a great exercise, as it can be done by anyone almost anywhere, costs nothing, and is very effective.    Your body naturally acts in the most efficient way it can, so it has to be "told" that the fat you want to get rid of is preventing it from carrying out the workload you impose on it in the most efficient way possible. It will then adjust itself and the excess fat will go.    I hope and believe this will work for you. Try it, and good luck.

ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target  your problem areas for men and women.

If it was because you lost your job and had employer-sponsored insurance, you need to contact your former benefits representative about COBRA.

Stronger can lift the 100 lbs. Endurance is how long you can keep up the activity. Can you lift 50 lbs over your head 10 times or twenty times. The longer you can do something before tiring out, you have more endurance. Like running - someone who can run a mile in 6 minutes is stronger than someone who can run it in 8 minutes. But to be able to keep up that pace for an hour has more endurance.|`|8hIUOajLaa	Lets say you can bench press like 500, that would be strength.

Endurance is the long distance runner or swimmer.

Qxh1kPLfaa	I have a milk allergy, kids with milk allergies and wheat issues also.    Goats milk is not a good option.  The protein is too close to the milk protein.  Soy milk is good for some.  The coffee place we frequent has soy as an option.  I hear nut milks are good too.    Wheat substitution is probably the hardest I have had to deal with in this house.  It is not just a 1:1 sub as with many other subs.  You would need to find a gluten free flour mix or flour mix recipe online.  They often have 3-4 flours to try and recreate the texture of regular items.  The gluten free flours alone often do not create appealing products - especially the bean flours.  Even in a mix, the bean flours can be bitter.   The challenge will be to find one that works best in the product you have in mind.|`|4c692d7ab158ee64f8b0f7a892d3e769aa	i am a coeliac.    recently found that costa have gf/wf crisps and a raspberry shortbread for us  nero have a chocolate brownie  coffee republic have an amazing brownie  pret have a orange  and almond cake  marks and spencers do a fruit cake,muffin and cookies!    alll very yummy and thoughlt tested by me! x

YqayaySoaa	I think it's a pretty safe med to take but different people will react differently to it. I was put on it for anxiety,  my IBS and to help me sleep better. It didn't do anything for my anxiety but it worked great for sleep for the first couple of months and then it like stopped working. Also it didn't do anything for my IBS. And when I first started taking it I had terrible headaches but they went away.    I stopped taking it because I got up really early this one day. I am not a morning person at all and my mom and I were in walmart and I yelled at her for no reason at all. And like a few minutes later I could not remember what I said to her. I have heard that it causes memory loss but this kind of freaked me out so I weaned myself off of it.     Even though I had a bad experience you could have a great one. I would just try it out see if it works.
SZ6q8Jfxaa	well it sounds like the first doctor did a lot more tests to try to find the real problem and the second doctor was simply being lazy. it also sounds like you're having a reaction to the meds the first doc put you on. if he's sure that its your thyroid, then maybe go back and try different meds or look at the side effects because what you're experiencing may be a side effect.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	You need to discuss these issues with a Dr, not us....

A few tips to help you stay warm. Leave your clothes in a warm room overnight, not in a cold bedroom. Get dressed in that warm room. I sometimes put the clothes on a warm radiator ready for the morning. Put a couple of pairs of socks on and keep the hot water bottle away from your bare skin as it could cause painful chilblains. The bottle will stay warmer longer with a cover on it.  Wear several, loose layers of clothing, the layers keep the warm air trapped within. Wrap a warm scarf around your neck and leave it on all day and make sure your wrists are covered up. It makes a huge difference. Long sleeves that go down on to the hands really keep in the warmth. Try to move around in the house if you are at home. sitting around brings the body temperature down. which is one of the reasons why elderly people find it so difficult to keep warm. Make sure you get hot food and plenty of hot drinks, your body needs the extra energy as it uses up more calories when the weather is cold. If you are really cold, then put on a pair of gloves but make sure your hands are warm first, otherwise they will stay cold.

I'm guessing you're in the range of 100-200 lbs so that would be between 5 - 10 percent of your body weight.  That's quite a bit.  to loose.  Secondly, loosing that much that quickly will only lead to gaining it back.  It would be very hard to keep that weight off, and would require a pretty dramatic lifestyle change.      All that being said, the only time i've been able to loose a good amount of weight quickly is when i was very sick one year.  It was kinda like a cross between Mono (the exhausted feeling one) and the Flu. I lost 4 lbs in 23 hrs.

Marijuanas effects on the user and detection time depend on its strength or potency, which is related to the amount of THC(Tetrahydrocannabinol) it contains.    When you ask the question How long does marijuana stay in your system? you need to take into account the fact that there is no simple answer to this question. THC (Tetrahydrocannabinol) can stay in a person's body for as long as 3 to 90 days after smoking or being ingested orally. There are numerous determining factors for how long drug toxins stay in a persons body which vary from person to person, such as the analytical method used, your health, your body weight, metabolism, fluid intake, the type of drug toxin, and the degree of exposure to the drug toxin.     The speed at which marijuana leaves your body depends both on the speed of your metabolism, as well as on the half life of THC. Its estimated that THC can have a half life that ranges anywhere from 1-10 days. Its almost impossible to find out what that half life is, which means that it is very difficult to use it to calculate how long it will take for all of the THC to leave your body.     For this reason, when you ask How long does marijuana stay in your system? you have to realize that its very unlikely that youll be able to get a usable answer. The most common period of time is anywhere from 3-30 days, depending on your metabolism and the amount of marijuana that youve smoked. This is unfortunate, since it means that while most drug tests can only turn up evidence of other drugs if youve been taking the drug within a few days of the drug test, marijuana could still be detected in a urine test up to a month after the last time it is used. If you smoke it occasionally it will remain in your system for up to 10 days. If you smoke marijuana on a regular basis it will stay in your system for as long as 45 days, and if you smoke marijuana at a constant pace, it can stay in the body for 90 days, Marijuana is fat soluble. It stores in the fat cells of the body, the brain, the liver, the kidneys, in other words the major organs.     Hair tests are even worse, since your body stores THC in the hair follicles. For this reason, the previous answers to How long does marijuana stay in your system? are only useful if youre going to be forced to take a urine test. For the hair test, depending on the amount of hair that the company takes, its possible that marijuana could be detected up to three years after the last time that you smoke.|`|GOwi8rbzaa	well i smoked weed a week and a half ago and i passed my school drug test, i was freakin out cause i thought that it stayed in your system for a month, it actually depends on how much you smoked i think, but idk cause i drank alot of water, so tht could be a reason i passed...|`|40e6935d5d64989ebb21a5b840e52e2baa	You better hope that they don't ask for a hair sample instead of a urine sample.

10gWrPrgaa	Taking AP courses is probably a good idea, especially if they have AP Psychology or something like that at your school, however you're just starting high school. For now, you should just worry about getting good grades maybe get involved in extracurricular activites such as sports, school clubs, student gov, volunteer, etc. Anyways, to answer your question, the steps towards becoming a psychiatrist are the following:    1- You should probably start studying for your SAT's around 10th-11th grade. Around that same time you should start researching about colleges (location, size, programs, requirements, etc.) Your school most likely has a counselor that can help you out with this.  2- Take the SAT (and try to get a good score) Most universities also require SAT II's so you probably will have to take those. (ACT is also sometimes an option)  3- Apply for college... where you can either major in Biology like the majority of premeds or you may choose your own major, like Psychology (that's what I did) However, if you choose your own major you have to make sure you take all of the required courses for Medical School (2 Bios, 2 Chems, 2 Orgo's, 2 Physics... and I think a couple of others like english and social sciences)   4- Study and take the MCAT (again, a good score here helps a lot) Do research on the schools you would like to apply and what scores you would need to get in  5- Apply to Medical School (AMCAS)   6- Graduate from college  7-1st yr of Medical School (when you actually see the "famous cadaver") and 2nd yr- learn the basic sciences (in some schools the first two years are pass/fail)  8- Summer after second year, study and take the USMLE Step 1 (good score*)  9- 3rd yr (when you actually get to see and interact with patients)  10- Study and take USMLE Step 2CK (good score*)  11- 4th yr (electives mostly)  12- USMLE Step 2CS (pass/fail)  13- Apply for residency (ERAS)  14- Graduate from Medical School (You're an MD!)  15- First yr of residency PGY1 (you're an intern, the bottom of the food chain... just above a Medical Student)  16- PGY 2, 3 & 4  17- Graduate from residency  18- Pass the Psych Boards   Congratulations! You are now a Psychiatrist!* =)  At this point, you may practice psychiatry (open up an office or work at a hospital or something like that) or you may choose to continue your studies and do a Fellowship in something like Child & Adolescent Psychiatry, Substance Abuse, Forensic Psychiatry, etc.    So, as you can see, you still have a long road ahead. So, yes, you should try to do well in school, but you should also try to have some fun. ;)    Well, hope this helps! Good luck and take care! =)|`|pfm0wcEIaa	A psychiatrist is a Medical Doctor, so you should primarily focus on the steps to get into medical school first.    Taking, AP Chemistry is a really good idea.  Also, AP Physics.  I wouldn't worry too much about biology or anatomy since those are easy classes to take in college.    It would be a good idea to apply to a school that has a 7 year college/med school program.  I know Northwestern University has it. And I believe SUNY and Georgetown University has it.  This is really the best way to go, because if you don't, then you have to go through the whole process of taking the MCAT and reapplying after you are done with your bachelor's.  Believe me you don't want to do that if you  don't have to...    The next thing you would have to do is ensure that you get a residence to be a psychiatrist.  You might want to find a psychiatrist and personally ask him or her about this.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	you will need to go to med school and study to be a doctor and then specilise in psychiatry|`|daFm97O8aa	If your school offers a psychology course take it..

Then you will go for you PhD. It is very hard to get into a PhD program without having amazing grades..|`|viD4WZAdaa	Just watch the parliament channel in the UK.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Discharge is your vaginas way of keeping itself clean and protected, fluids line the walls of your vagina to keep it moist so it does not dry or split, and fluids also wash out dead cells or excess bacteria to keep the vagina clean  your vagina is cleaner than your mouth and 'self-cleans'. Thus you ALWAYS have discharge, it changes as your hormones change, from very little discharge, to gummy or sticky discharge, to milky discharge and slippery or stretchy discharge around ovulation  around ovulation which is normally two weeks before your period your vagina produces this slippery stretchy discharge known as 'fertile quality cervical mucus'. This fertile quality cervical mucus is there to protect sperm and help it reach the egg when you are fertile, you may not notice the discharge as stretchy but you may feel wetter at this time. Even during your period you still have discharge, you just don't notice it due to the menstrual flow.     If you pay attention to your discharge you will see the changes, it is good to know what is normal discharge for you at any one time in your menstrual cycle as then you can tell when your discharge is abnormal which can be a sign of an infection. Things to look out for are unusual colour such as green or yellow, bad odor such as a smell of fish, itching or burning, or odd texture such as very watery or like cottage cheese. If you get any of these changes to your discharge see a doctor for tests and treatment as sometimes they can be serious infections or may becomes more serious if left without treatment. Even if you keep very clean and practice safe sex you will have vaginal infections from time to time, here are some tips for avoiding infections and keeping yourself healthy;    - Don't put anything into your vagina that you would not put into your mouth.  - Wash with water alone as your vagina is self-cleaning.  - Avoid soaps, perfumes, washes, wipes, and 'feminine washes'.  - Clean around your clitoris head by gently cleaning under the hood.   - Don't douche, this forces 'bad' bacteria up and washes 'good' bacteria out.   - Always wipe from front to back after you have been on the toilet.   - Avoid tampons and commercial pads, try cups, organic pads or alternatives.  - Wear all cotton white panties, avoid thongs or g-strings and synthetics.  - Don't wear underwear to bed, or PJ bottoms if you can help it.  - Eat a healthy diet, avoid refined sugars as much as possible.  - Go for regular checkups and get treatment when needed.   - Give yourself regular check overs to make sure everything is ok.     Safe sex;   - Make sure hands touching vagina and vulva are always clean with short nails.  - Only use water-based lubricants or appropriate lubricants during play.  - Don't move anything from anus to vagina without cleaning first.  - Use a condom or other safe sex barrier with any sort of sexual activity.   - Pee after sex and wash with water to flush away bacteria from vulva.   - Don't use sugary food stuffs in your vagina during sex play.     I would suggest you avoid the liners as these will prevent air getting to your genitals which will make the area warm and moist, perfect for bacteria and yeast to multiply that can lead to odor and infections - particularly if using commercial brands as these contain chemicals that can interefere with the natural balance of your vagina flora which can also cause problems. If you do insist on using liners try organic brands like Cottons or cloth brands like Lunpads which are healthier and more comfortable than commercial brands.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Its the bodies way of cleaning itself.  Dont worry~;|`|iaMBgc6iaa	Girls always discharge. From what my girl has told me, its completely normal.|`|AA10857340	Has this always happend?  Are you sexually active?  If so did it only start after?  Do you have any symptoms like a bad smell or weird color?  Some women just have more discharge than other women.  Go see a doctor they can maybe give you birth control that can regulate your hormones better.      Good luck :)|`|PYIA2FCFaa	i have the same problem. i HAVE to have pantiliners and I hate wearing them. I went to my gyno and had it tested for BV and it all came back fine. It also concerned me b/c mine can be anywhere from clear to yellowish greenish. no smell, no itching..just a lot of it. I never had the problem before so it bothered me a lot. Now, I just accept it and keep dry as much as possible.
Hbvquautaa	Stress and changing hormonal levels are HUGE factors in menstrual cycles. I didn't have mine for over 4 months once due to stress. She shouldn't worry!|`|pSpEVHzjaa	You should ask a doctor. I actually just went threw this same thing. Except it took my period a month late to come. I was SOO scared. But it eventually came. My periods are always right on time to. So i guess idk what caused it to be a month late. If it doesn't come soon i would ask a doctor. But i doubt she is pregnant.|`|M93Ot353aa	just go buy a pregnancy test and see.|`|c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	My goodness, that's a detailed question...how should we know?  Stop obsessing...get on with your lives and always use protection....|`|fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	A lot of detail but absolutely nothing that could actually help us answer the question, Im going to guess that she is in her teens in which case it is normal for periods to be irregular due to her body still developing. Stress will also delay menstruation, now you dont actually say how long her cycles are or how regular she is, but either way there doesnt seem to be anything to worry about so as the other person said stop obsessing and get on with your lives.     The obvious questions are;  Has she taken emergency contraception?  Has she tried inducing her periods?     Tests are all well and good, but they wouldnt be able to tell you if she was pregnant or not so early on, also depending on her cycle she may not have even been ovulating, remember that women can only get pregnant while ovulating and a few days beforehand while fertile cervical mucus is present. That means there are only a few days per cycle she can get pregnant, so you only have a 25% chance of her getting pregnant per cycle. I would like to point out that safe sex is about more than using a condom, you should always be using protection but make sure that you are doing more to protect against infections, diseases and unwanted pregnancy than using condoms, I dont just mean using another form of birth control (to be honest most of the time Id advise against that, depending on the situation and type of birth control being used, condoms are enough) but I mean general common sense. Now if you are panicking THIS much without there actually being anything to panic about then I can only assume that you are not ready to be a father, so perhaps you should reconsider being sexually active in that case.
fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	Your breasts develop in your teens towards your twenties, if your breasts have developed normally and menstruation has started then there is little you can do to noticeably increase breast size short of going the radical route of plastic surgery. There are breast enlargement creams but these are just oestrogen creams, as your body produces enough of this naturally all these creams will do is cause the ducts in your breasts grow. The area that makes your breasts bigger is the fat pad in the breast which can be made bigger through weight gain, but the healthiest way to increase breast size is to exercise your pectoral muscles through push-ups and weightlifting. Increasing the muscles in your chest can help your breasts appear fuller, also a better posture will help in that when you are standing up straight the pectoral muscle is 'thrown' outwards helping the breasts appear larger.     If worried about the size fo your breasts then the best thing you can do is stop worrying and start loving your body as it is, if worried about your sex appeal know that comes from self-confidence not breast size and any guy worth knowing won't care about breast size. Learn to love your breasts, know how to care for them through breast massage and breast self-examination, you may feel bad about them, but that isn't anything to do with your breast size, it is about how you feel about your breasts. Take it from someone who knows, you need to appreciate what you've got as otherwise you'll spend your whole life unhappy.

Then the overall weight will show. What you can do is strengthen the muscles under neath the breast. That will make them stay perky. Isometrics can be used as well as light weight bearing exercises.

Also, if you use electric appliances to assist you, there is always the possibility of getting stuck in them or electrocuting yourself. Depending on your medical condition, you could have a heart attack but then that could happen during sex.      There are also the psychological dangers. If you do it too often, and do not have regular sex often enough, you may grow to prefer masturbation. I mean, YOU are going to know what you like more than anyone else so it could happen that you just won't find other types of sex stimulating enough.     Also, if you allow your fantasy life to go to extremes there is the potential that you may eventually feel the need to act them out which may not always be in the best interest of you or your partner.     Overall, if you masturbate once in a while but continue to have other types of sex, you will not have a problem. Please avoid electrical devices that were not meant for that purpose though. You will not go blind and you will not grow hair on your palms.

Some people still seem to believe that, but that claim has no scientific grounds whatsoever.

ljVwo5qZaa	No it's nothing like that. Creatine isn't bad for you at all and is the most studied sports supplement in the world. It is completely safe. There are numerous studies that say so.    Steriods on the other hand can wreck havoc on your entire body.|`|satoCRC6aa	no, just don't overdue the dosage. no long term effects|`|rcPnnfmmaa	Not in a medical sense. However rare side effects may include being kicked off of competitive sports teams; it's cheating and very easy to test for.|`|8hIUOajLaa	Not like sterioids, your body naturally produces creatine via meats an legumes. You just have to cycle the course of creatine so that you body stays active in producing its own, basically follow the instructions on the packaging.    Creatine is an energy source via ATP stored in your muscles.  Steroids work via hormone alteration and addition.    Shout if you need more :p|`|P3Njb3wOaa	Creatine is naturally occurring Amino acid. Most studies show when following directions properly there are no adverse side effects. You must consume plenty of water to avoid dehydration.    It's also important to cycle creatine (on 6-8 weeks of 6-8 weeks) or it looses effectiveness and over work your kidneys (due to how much water you retain).   Creatine is nothing like a steroid. Putting them in the same category is just plain silly.|`|YbnqMe11aa	Nope.

uFRIsdC7aa	Step1. Tilt your head backwards and shake a little bit of salt straight into the back of your throat. Make sure you shake it straight into your throat, onto the base of your tongue and not over the middle or the tip your tongue (this way you will not suffer from any unpleasant taste). shake 2 to 6 times depending how bad your sore throat is. If you're using a fast food style paper saltshaker, you should shake about 1/4 of the packet directly into your throat.   http://www.ehow.com/how_4720022_rid-sore...    2 MORE STEP

5kK2f9Utaa	No diet is effective, its has to be a lifestyle change. Diets can help you lose weight but they're hard to stick to and tend you leave you hungry. Instead try eating small healthy meals about 5 or 6 times a day. Don't make them so big that you can't eat again in a few hours because that will ruin the plan. Having a meal so close together helps keep your metabolism going and will help you burn more calories. Keep this plan along with daily workouts and you'll see better results than with dieting. You'll be more tempted to stick to it since you wont go hungry all day!

If you need more info do google search because complete answer is beyond scope of this forum.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Basically none. I've seen my friends and family members try everything from Atkins to Weight Watchers, Nutrisystem to Jenny Craig and so many more. You lose the weight you want to, but as soon as you stop the diet you gain it all back (and then some). The only thing that works is learning to incoorperate healthy eating and exersize into your diet. Start slowly, and lose the weight the right way. I started by just cutting back a little on how much I ate, and walking a half hour each day. Zone, Special K, and Slim Fast all make really good snack bars in different flavors, so when I'm craving something sweet I go for one of them. I've learned that trying to avoid cravings always ends up making me eat more. If you do it the right way, it will take time for you to see major results, but it's the only 100% proven effective way to lose weight.

RGvNRH8Iaa	I am not sure if you are not having orgasms at all, or if you mean you are not squirting.  But I think you mean squirting, so I will answer for that...    Very few women squirt when they orgasm, and even if it happened to you once it doesnt mean you will always be able to.  I really dont believe most men expect women to squirt anyway.      If you just dont feel you get as wet as you should, you may want to try foreplay for longer periods of time.  Some women (including me) can just take a long time to get wet.
FVhvys3iaa	I'm 24 and here's what I do to de-stress or relax, in no particular order.    1. Exercise.  2. Go for a walk/hike--iPod and or dog, optional.  :)  3. Glass of wine.

Shopping--even if it's just window shopping.  8. Take a class.  A lot of home improvement and craft stores offer free ones, for example.  (My class of choice?  Belly dancing.)  9.

Day7: Rest  --------------------------------------...    and this is my breakfast & lunch diet:    Breakfast (same as Lunch):  -1/2 cup oatmeal = (150 calories), 27 g carbs, 5g protein  -3 egg whites = (17 calories each, 51 total), 12g protein  -1 chicken tender = 75 calories, 16g protein  2+ Cups of water  (1 multi vitamin with breakfast only)|`|yfKSYPQaaa	very simple, all you need is a balanced diet.

For a Challenge, lift your feet off the ground and feel your abs/obq muscles burn while you twist.|`|fL3SiRDWaa	Crunches, and when you come up twist your abs to the side, you will feel the burn, they are awesome!!|`|qXpxILnRaa	Ooh...definitely try these!!!!!!!|`|XfZ83sbHaa	Lay on your side with an ab roller and do crunches.    If you don't have an ab roller, still lay on your sides and do 4 sets of 30 two times a day.    Drink a gallon of water also a day.

Finally got a foot tub massager at wall mart for 20 bucks, soaked my foot evary day for a half hour, and scraped away skin and pulled out the hard stud with a tweezer. and its gone.the key was soaking it reliougisly every day. good luck
13af9e7d01005124bab39c9f0b0db946aa	You can get awesome results in 3 months and I mean total body transformation. Just invest in a book called Body Sculpting Bible for Woman. Read it cover to cover before you begin, have a highlighter ready and mark pages you know you'll want to reread. Follow the instructions to the letter and you will be sooooooooo amazed at what your body can look like that you will be impressed at how easy and quickly it happened.    Oh if you're a guy there is a book for men as well with the same title only for men.|`|gqvvXknQaa	Start eating healthy. Stay away from junk food and alcohol. Drink plenty of water!    Start a daily exercise routine. Plenty of cardio to burn fat.
iaHM24Xjaa	If you use your hands lots of laborious jobs eg. gardening washing up - perhaps that could be hard skin forming. I think maybe continue applying cream and if it continues to get worse seek proper advice.|`|XAAF7R23aa	what job do you do, have you changed your soap powder? looks to me like something you are using that you have not used before. it is not agreeing with you. You have to go through what you have changed and experiment i think.|`|W7qmkVFxaa	lamisil
8b605189bffd91d0497498eabf8d3d17aa	Lisinopril is an Ace inhibitor used to control high blood pressure and to help prevent kidney damage, your blood pressure will be measured at the time and if high could be a reason to deny you.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Yes, in most cases that isn't a blocking factor.    You will be given a questionaire to fill out on the health issues you have. Be very honest with your medications on these questionaires.    The only people blocked right now from donating blood are those with STDs, who have lived in Europe in the last 15 years, those who may have taken Animal Derived Insulins (not available in USA in last 15 yrs), and any other COMMUNICABLE disease.    Heart disease is NOT communicable!
zaogXoHjaa	Apparently they shouldn't as its unhealthy but I've noticed people get shorter.  My friends Grandad used to be 5"11 and now he's 5"8|`|H0aiDO9Paa	Yes. After age 40 or so, the disks separating the vertebrae in the spine start to shrink; the back muscles weaken, which may allow posture to slump; and bone mass can decline by as much as 8 percent per decade in women, 3 percent in men. On average, people lose about 3 inches in height by their mid-80s or 90s. (Osteoporosis, or severe bone thinning can drastically reduce height as well, by causing the vertebrae to fracture and collapse.) And good luck.|`|8cDd70dSaa	Some do. It's due to degeneration of the spine and loss of calcium from the bones.|`|1b4c2ef06139746bf0c23a8101562dcfaa	Not as a general rule; however, as we age we are prone to osteoarthritis (this is the wear & tear type arthritis.) This arthritis causes joint space narrowing and erosion of the cartilage in the knee joint which can cause a slight decrease in height.|`|XAAF7R23aa	yes i was totally shocked, moved house went to a new doctor, and he measured both myself and my husband, my height had gone down by 1.5 inches and his by 2 inches, the doc says that is normal|`|12a37bf38f7fb21bfefcd10a348ca1beaa	.YES,When i came out of the RAF in 1949 i was 5 ft 81/4.Now that i am having my 80th birthday on MON, 9 FEB i am only 5ft61/2. The bits of cartilage between all your joints,dries out, reducing your height .I still feel as fit as a butchers dog, only not quite as fast as when i was chasing my wife.
vpIl1I6Yaa	yup!!!  any ailment will suffice.  even cures cancer and a great deterent against ebola.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	Yes. You have to talk to your doctor and plead a good story, maybe with a few examples of times where it really made a urgent difference. Don't just make it seem like you're wanting to get pot to get high but that it truly helps your ailment.|`|AbxG3GjDaa	if you really want your ADHD and bipolar depression to be treated, why not use vilift, it really worked on mine.
Hbvquautaa	It doesn't necessarily mean you have an STD. It could be as simple as they detected some early forming abnormal cells and want to remove them. This is a very common occurrence and easy to take care of.     Bottom line is: don't stress or worry until you get the results. There's no point in running yourself down if you don't know what the deal is.|`|RtskgjPKaa	They cannot hold that info from you talk to the doctor I know how you feel went through the same thing but I would call back and tell them to have the doctor call you as soon as he can!|`|9EkFrApiaa	I would be FREAKING out too.  I would call and speak with the doctor.  They cannot with hold that information from you, it is your body!  Not everything that they test for in pap will show.  Blood born stds do not come through in paps (i.e. hepatitis, hiv, and what not).  I have been where you are before and it truly does suck!  Once this idiot told me I had herpes and then I went in and the doctor was like, "no, the nurse is new and didn't know what the scale was for that test but you are negative."  I had been in tears for like days!  I was SUPER pissed.  Just try and get to the doctor on the phone.
uFRIsdC7aa	YES HIS COLD OR THE FLU|`|gcVeEbiNaa	It sounds like you could have contracted part of his illness.   For the cough I could recommend Muscinex. This helps break up mucus and make it easier to cough up.   I prefer liquid Tylenol for any fever and aches. It really helps the pain quickly!   As far as what you're doing, you are spot on! Plenty of rest and fluids will help your body fight anything that may come along. Emergen-C can help jump start your immune system.   If you don't feel better in a few days get to a doctor just to make sure it's nothing more serious that would require antibiotics!  Get well soon! :)
c08708aebaf627e023dde432dde5dc5aaa	I'm sure you didn't do that to yourself...get checked at a Dr....|`|nGu08Xb5aa	Sadly, there is no way to undo this without a very painful surgery. You may have a very adept form of scoliosis. I hope you feel better
lkNJNnlSaa	I'm sure it is.|`|0I9Fm00Naa	Unfortunately for those of us who are under 62 years of age there is not much help. Some Organizations offer free dental to people that are unable to afford dental care. Mostly by drawing only,(St Vincent De Paul Society)is one.You can also contact your local VA Hospital to find out if they know where you can get on these lists.They can also give you information on some of the Dental Colleges in your area. Contact the Salvation Army , and the Red Cross, They may not do anything for you but may have some information for you. If you can get onto your states insurance for the poor , they will provide emergency dental care (clean/ Pull only) for people in need of dental help. However only people under 21 can obtain a substantial amount of help through these programs. Good luck , I hope this will give you a few ideas for obtaining some help.|`|f9fc3e09ca2e86f4c585e20819e94635aa	If you live in the UK and claiming any kind of social security benefit, then it is.  If not, you need to look for a dentist who is still taking on national health patients - they're few and far between incidentally.  If you find such a dentist, I think you still pay a percentage of the costs of the treatment.|`|76505f2fb0541953a0e5c4cf6c51e545aa	Sorry but you will still have to pay for your dental treatment, no matter what age you are, unless under 18 years.  It will cost you 44.60 for the extractions, which wil include the check up, xrays and a scale and polish if it is needed.   If you claim pension credit guarantee then you will get the treatment for free.
uFRIsdC7aa	I THINK YOU ARE ALRIGHT.|`|7add460ae24c9452ae87b5a99c5aa756aa	You should be fine.|`|AA10213842	absolutely appaulled by the answers given on yahoo q and a regarding hcv and snorting cocaine.    first of all, all it takes is a teeny bit of blood- so small and unseen to the naked eye to transmit hcv infection.    secondly, the WORST thing to use to snort cocaine is a dollar bill- it has not only virus activity on it (it's the most filthy thing to use) but, more than likely has blood on it. DRIED or wet, unseen to the naked eye!    thirdly, when one snort cocaine, the small capallaries in the nose and nasal passages DO BLEED. you may not know it, but it does happen because cocaine causes them to open. (burning sensation comes from the dilation of those small blood vessels) so you may or may not notice blood- many do not notice bleeding unless they are chronic users of cocaine.    your risk factor is high. hcv infectious blood whether wet or dry can still transmit. dried blood in up to 4 days has been known to infect, so even if you didn't share the rolled dollar bill, chances are that blood particles (dry) were on that dollar bill from whomever else used it- whether they bled on it from a cut or snorted cocaine with it!    your playing with fire.     you should have a test now (to rule out past exposure) and then re-test again in about 50 days to detect if you got hcv snorting after the one with HCV. sometimes it can take longer to develope enough quasispecies of hcv for tests to detect.  (quasispecies- hcv does change its viron genetics through cyclic activity. Once the parental virus makes its way into the liver, it reproduces and changes it's viron sequence) this is how it outsmarts the bodies defense mechanisms and thus, becomes chronic in most people.)     a risk factor is a risk factor is a risk factor!     as for him doing antiviral therapy for hcv and responding to it- he still carries antibodies for hcv infection which ARE transferrable to those using the same bill. plus, how does he know he hasn't relapsed? all it takes is the same abuse patterns to either re-activate the same virus or share in the same risk factors he may have gotten hcv from in the first place!!!! many people have NO idea they have hcv infection- especially in those that share risky behaviour!    get tested!    (to the "physician") - I suggest going back to college- seriously and learn not only from your patients, but to re-read some literature on hcv infection!!!!!|`|kxyR9e57aa	Hepatitis C is spread via exchange of bodily fluids, especially blood, so it is easily spread when IV drug users share needles, or when the same needle is used to do tattoos on multiple persons.  It would be virtually impossible to get it snorting coke with the same bill used by others, since there is no significant interchange of bodily fluids. But I hope you understand that doesn't mean it's okay to keep doing coke, snorting or otherwise.
