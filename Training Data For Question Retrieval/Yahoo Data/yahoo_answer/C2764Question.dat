20090202214654AAWC9qE	Dining Out;United States;Los Angeles	Denny's Free Grand Slam question?	So my question about the free Grand Slam giveaway tomorrow at Denny's is that if the offer starts at 6AM, but you arrive there before 6AM (i.e. 5:30, 5:45) will the offer still be validated for a free grand slam?      Or are they going to end up seating us before 6AM and actually take the order at 6?   HAHA, silly question I know but it's one to think about since I'm going to try and beat the crowd as I still have school.       thanks!
