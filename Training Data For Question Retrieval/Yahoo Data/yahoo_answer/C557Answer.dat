Acai by itself does not provide a ton of energy so they put other products in to make the acai berry work better as a weight loss product|`|BUmhBSf4aa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you specifically.

I40iBJdHaa	it's nearly impossible to describe what  vagina smells like. it like trying to explain what chicken smells like to someone who has never smelled it. the taste can be almost tasteless, to salty, to somewhat tangy. <br>  so you get your ten bucks.|`|cTYAYrb9aa	Why not find out. Idiot.|`|AA12198724	Well it depends upon two things: Diet and Maintenance. If the person eats a lot of unhealthy food their vagina may emit the odor and the discharge does not taste as pleasant (i.e. eating some very fattening chinese food and going down on someone the next day it tastes like chinese a bit and may leave a like unpleasant after taste that is body odor). If the person has a healthy diet like if they eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and healthy grains then there may be a chance that the vaginal fluid will taste sweet. This week I went two days drinking only meal shakes so then following days my discharge and urine smelled like coconuts, dulce de leche, and strawberries but there was not really a taste to the fluid.<br>  <br>  Smell wise depends upon the maintenance. Like if the girl has an infection or std it may not smell pleasant or if she was exercising for a long period of time there may be a strong odor similar to body odor. If the girl maintains her vagina very well then there should really not be an odor.<br>  <br>  Hopes this helps but I think you and your friend should just give eachother five bucks.|`|sDZqabbxaa	The female vagina?<br>  <br>  As opposed to the..male vagina?<br>  <br>  retard.|`|D0SZ4kFyaa	Tastes like chicken. <br>  Get lost you troll.|`|Ilt3hH7Taa	it doesnt taste sweet :S<br>  <br>  Or smell sweet

Its only when the condition is bad, then you use medications like Minocycline.<br>  <br>  Anyway here's 4 top secrets that I found on <a href="http://www.acnepimplezits.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.acnepimplezits.com</a><br>  <br>  I copied some of the main points, you can read more from there if you like.<br>  <br>  Eat A Healthy Diet<br>  A diet rich in vegetables, low Glycemic Index carbohydrates and lean protein can go a long way to helping clear up your skin of pimple.<br>  <br>  Water, Water, Water<br>  Water is not only good for your body, but also good for your skin<br>  <br>  Exercise<br>  Yep.

94eacd52d76b5f450c4b2099a14392d2aa	Perhaps it would be helpful to fill out the survey (1) on the Endometriosis Research Center's website (2) and bring it to your physician. <br>  <br>  I'd also recommend visiting the WeAreEndo site (3) for support and to help search out a good endometriosis specialist in your area. You can also visit the ERC's forums (4) for this information. <br>  <br>  Do you have any relatives or someone older who you trust and who can help you with this? Sometimes when you're young, doctors don't take you as seriously - but if you walk in with your mother, for example, who says, Listen, I've read this information and think something is really wrong and I expect you to provide her with a referral to a specialist, well, that could make the difference. <br>  <br>  I also just wanted to commend you for the amazing job you're doing at advocating for yourself. It sounds like you've done a lot of research and legwork. Keep it up!|`|dhr7nnxoaa	You might want to go to a different doctor this could be serious.|`|jycDSmPcaa	I'm the same age as you and actually have exactly the same problem. The doctor's answer to everything is "Oh, go on this pill", and they always make me ill.<br>  <br>  I think if you just describe your pain, and if he/she says "Try this" just say "No, that's not good enough, that hasn't worked at all. I want a referral."<br>  <br>  Be assertive with it. Good luck :)

Do your parents know? Go to a doctor. Even if it's something common, you can still get pain relief, and at least you'll know. Good luck.|`|apNnaxTZaa	Sounds like you have the flu. Drink plenty of fluids (at least (8) 8 oz of water daily) and take Ibuprofen for body aches.  You can alternate Ibuprofen and Tylenol if you spike another fever.

tIldpr7vaa	getting "tight" muscle  is just a matter of lowering ur body fat, has nothing to do with the actual muscle it self.

I heard on the news that if you have it on while in the sun it attracts the sun. So if you are out too long, it can cause skin cancer on the lips. But only if your lip gloss has NO sunscreen in it. If it doesn't a way to prevent it is to put on a lip gloss with sun protection. I have seen it happen.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Mary Poppins is right, if you read the article.|`|FicyC2TXaa	Neither lip gloss nor lipstick are listed as risk factors for any type of cancer  by any reputable cancer or medical organisation.<br>  <br>  The causes of cancer are not known.|`|rO0LyKiUaa	Dunno... but all I do know is....

j3LgrUsfaa	Personally I would go to an endocrinologist and get checked out. There are a list of medical problems that can cause such irregularities, many that can be treated and sometimes resolved. Having such an irregular period and not getting it treated can lead to future troubles such as not being able to have children, infections, cancers, and a lot more. I've also had the same problem, and have a specific health problem that requires certain medication (birth control, spirnolactone etc.) to get my cycle back on track. It may not be too serious, but I reccomend getting a check up by a doctor.|`|PHXFJeFpaa	had you only had it once before? because maybe you thought you did but you actually didnt and then you just still haven't had it yet.|`|fwKB6UExaa	Are you anorexic? on the pill? on drugs many reasons it could stop.|`|7zZCCxC5aa	two or three years?!?! you need to get that checked out! that's not good at all.|`|lVk3ZSnEaa	Are you old enough to have stopped your periods altogether?

dguR4W4Iaa	My story of someone playing with my emotions is not an easy story to tell. This guy pretended to care about me, and then he started verbally abusing me for months, and then he pretended to care about me again. This went on for a while. To be honest, every day felt like hell. Some days, I just wanted to be dead. And unfortunately, I had relied on self mutilation for a while in an attempt to ease the pain. (But I've been clean for a year and two months or so now, so it's all good.)<br>  <br>  But now, I never see this guy anymore. He has a girlfriend now, and I know her. She says that sometimes he treats her like dirt and other times he's great towards her. I feel bad for this girl, knowing that she's going through what I had to go through. The only difference is that I never went out with this guy, and she is.
57fZyjvgaa	It's fine. You probably did have some sort of nose bleed (perhaps from blowing your nose too hard or something). I've had this happen before and the blood went away within 2 days.<br>  <br>  If there is less blood than before then you don't need to worry - the only time to worry is if the blood is increasing.|`|nZ4cOSDZaa	think you should go to your doctor|`|Y2ybQEetaa	About spit phlegm in sink can be read in <a href="http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=spit%20phlegm%20in%20sink" rel="nofollow">http://health-schools.blogspot.com/?q=sp...</a>

TdsJwt3Haa	i had bunion surgery 2 years ago, however i had a pretty big one that required  2 hours of surgery and a cast for 6 weeks. But if you have a slight bunion then only minor surgery is needed, and you have to wear a post surgery shoe for about 1-2 weeks. It wasn't painful, but other foot only has a slight bunion but Im not sure if i will get surgery on it, only do it if its painful.|`|RppzWWtNaa	dont think so.|`|PSOPcbkFaa	Bunions may be treated conservatively with changes in shoe gear, different orthotics (accommodative padding and shielding), rest, ice, and medications. These sorts of treatments address symptoms more than they correct the actual deformity. Surgery, by a podiatrist or an orthopeadist, may be necessary if discomfort is severe enough or when correction of the deformity is desired.<br>  <br>  <br>  Orthotics<br>  Orthotics are splints, regulators while conservative measures include various footwear like gelled toe spacers, bunion / toes separators, bunion regulators, bunion splints, and bunion cushions.<br>  <br>  <br>   Surgery<br>  Procedures are designed and chosen to correct a variety of pathologies that may be associated with the bunion. For instance, procedures may address some combination of:<br>  <br>  removing the abnormal bony enlargement of the first metatarsal, <br>  realigning the first metatarsal bone relative to the adjacent metatarsal bone, <br>  straightening the great toe relative to the first metatarsal and adjacent toes, <br>  realigning the cartilagenous surfaces of the great toe joint, <br>  addressing arthritic changes associated with the great toe joint, <br>  repositioning the sesamoid bones beneath the first metatarsal bone, <br>  shortening, lengthening, raising, or lowering the first metatarsal bone, and <br>  correcting any abnormal bowing or misalignment within the great toe. <br>  The age, health, lifestyle, and activity level of the patient may also play a role in the choice of procedure.<br>  <br>  Bunion surgery can be performed under local, spinal, or general anesthetic. The trend has moved strongly toward using the less invasive local anesthesia over the years. A patient can expect a 6- to 8-week recovery period during which crutches are usually required for aid in mobility. It is much less common today as newer, more stable procedures and better forms of fixation (stabilizing the bone with screws and other hardware) are used.
VcqZJHfKaa	Actually, you don't have to diet in fact to lose weight, the only thing which really worked for me was green tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials in stock, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and CNN.

Start of easy and work your way up k.

But have you considered the consequences about building up your abs if you have a weak how (how at your age have you a weak back?)?

DI3u9gMSaa	Invisalign is not totally invisible if you get buttons put on your teeth.  From your description, it seems that your teeth will need to be filed and have buttons placed on them - the buttons will be noticeable.  If your teeth are as crooked as mine were, I would highly suggest getting traditional braces from the start.<br>  <br>  Your speech will be affected only during the first several days you put on each new aligner.  You will have a hard time saying words with the letter s.  <br>  <br>  Monthly payments are standard but keep in mind that most dental offices (at least here in the US) require a "down payment".  My total was about $4,500 and I paid $1,500 up front.<br>  <br>  The people who call you names will end up shining your shoes in 20 years.

7GLwe57Uaa	When you get your expander tomorrow it's going to feel strange. Your Speech will be affected and you'll probably do a lot of "slurping" for a day or 2. Your tongue will think it's food, which in turn makes your saliva glands more active.<br>  I'm not sure how old you are, but expanders are usually used on younger people because their upper palatal bone is two separate bones at this stage of life. So basically the expander is widening your upper jaw. Sounds like it would kill right?? Not so. It will feel tight, but then that feeling will go away after just a few minutes. I usually have parents turn the expander at night. That way the patient can get the expander turned and just go to bed. At first if you want to take a little tylenol, or motrin just before turing that might help.<br>  When it gets turned, if it hurts..as in a lot of pain, not pressure. STOP turning and see your orthodontist ASAP.<br>  <br>  It's better to do it now, than have to have it surgically done when you're an adult. It won't be in there to long. Maybe 4-5 months at the most. Then you should receive a retainer which will be important to keep in there for a while. If you don't. everything will collapse and you'll have to do the turning all over again.<br>  <br>  You'll do just fine!<br>  Good luck!!|`|cbz1qpYZaa	Your expander was custom fit, so it wont hurt when seated; just a little tight.<br>  As far as turning it, it is not painful, but uncomfortable for a minute<br>  (more odd feeling). <br>  Most people say they feel pressure in their sinuses that goes away in a few seconds.<br>  The worst thing is the gap between your front teeth.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	I would say pads such as Lunapads <a href="http://www.lunapads.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.lunapads.com</a> they are cloth pads which makes them instantly better than commercial pads because they are more hygienic and a hell of a lot more comfortable. Cloth pads in general are more comfortable so they won’t make you move about as much during your sleep, they are held in with fasteners rather than glue that would become unstuck, so cloth pads don’t gather up or leak as much, also you can add extra liners to the pad during the night for extra protection. Lunapads are particularly good as they are cheap and really well made so they sit nice and comfortably. I would also suggest their padded panties, these are underwear with pads built-in so they are much more comfortable and give better protection as they stay in place, close to your body and have the area of the underwear as well as the pad itself to keep leaks in at night, Lunapads do a brand called Lunapanties. Reddy’s pads <a href="http://www.reddyspads.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.reddyspads.com</a> are good too, these are period belts, they are about 3 times bigger than normal pads and fasten around your waste, this means that they don’t move about in your sleep, and they give much better protection. <br>  <br>  As a note, tampons are unsafe whenever you wear them, using them overnight not only means you can’t change them every 4-6 hours as you’re supposed to, but it also means there is less flow going into the tampon. With less flow going into the tampon it means it absorbs more vaginal fluids, this cause vaginal splitting and ulceration due to vaginal dryness. This is a major contributing factor to tampon risks such as TSS, vaginal infections and difficult periods, this is also why you don’t use tampons on light days, when not menstruating, and you always use the lowest absorbency possible. <br>  <br>  Have you considered menstrual cups? Menstrual cups are bell-shaped cups made from silicone or rubber that you insert into your vagina to collect menstrual flow. Cups are folded, inserted and you twist to create a light seal, to remove simply squeeze the bottom and pull out. They are an alternative to tampons as they're safe and hygienic, don't encourage bacterial growth or prevent vaginal cleaning, they can also lessen cramps and flow compared to tampons. Cups don't leak and can be worn for up to 12 hours including before your period, during the night, for sports including swimming, and from light to heavy flow. Cups are safe, clean, hygienic, mess-free, fuss-free, convenient, comfortable, easy to use, reliable, environmentally friendly, body-positive, cheap and companies are ethical. Menstrual cup brands; Divacup, Mooncup UK, Mooncup US, The Keeper, Miacup, Lunette, Ladycup, Pinkcup, Femmecup, Yuuki. I’d recommend <a href="http://www.ladycup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.ladycup.com</a> Ladycup. There are also softcups called Instead <a href="http://www.softcups.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.softcups.org</a> which are a similar but sit higher up in the vagina, softcups can also be worn during sex to avoid mess during menstruation.|`|QJHE3z1raa	always infinity overnight :)|`|8d5f0adc83a9aec3f83894da97ca8d80aa	honestly, you just have to try them and decide which one is best for you.

ItJzrvQ4aa	jogging is an excellent exercise because it let you lose weight<br>  evenly throughout your whole body. If you want to lose weight in<br>  specific areas, you should target them with exercises. If they are<br>  your problem areas, they will be very difficult to tone. You will have<br>  to work double on them. The best approach is this:<br>  1. Lower/control your daily calorie intake (control for normal<br>  weight, lower for overweight).<br>  2. Run/jog to lower your overall body fat percentage.<br>  3. Target your problem areas with exercises.<br>  an  excellent  exercise,  you  can do it in front of your TV: sit on a<br>  stool,  and  put  your toes under something (piece of heavy furniture,<br>  for  example). In your hands hold a little dumbbell. Please, make sure<br>  that  it  is  not very heavy, start with one kilo, for example, or you<br>  will  damage  your  back and spine! Slowly move the upper part of your<br>  body  back, until it's parallel with the ground. Stop for a second and<br>  move it back to the sitting position. Repeat ten times. Every week add<br>  to  the  number  of  repetitions.  You will see the results in a week,<br>  guaranteed! You will see or feel under the fat - if you have any - six<br>  pack  and  muscles.  Dumbbells  do  wonders.  Much  better  than these<br>  crunches  -  I  came  up to three hundreds and there was no results AT<br>  ALL.

ouzrDPaSaa	I've just answered your other question on depersonalisation.  As I said I experience this sometimes, and it's been when Im out in a public place and/or with people so I dont think where you are plays a factor in it.  I've read up a bit on depersonalisation to try to understand why I might be experiencing it and have never came accross anything saying people dont normally experience it around others either.<br>  <br>  Mind's website has some info on depersonalisation and related issues <a href="http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Booklets/Understanding/Understanding+dissociative+disorders.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Bookl...</a>|`|DsEEATKSaa	No, it is not true.<br>  <br>  In fact, stress is most assuredly a major trigger for dissociative episodes (depersonalization being a major example). If a vulnerable individual is stressed, traumatized or otherwise triggered when in the presence of others, depersonalization could certainly result.<br>  <br>  ~Dr. B.~|`|xnZi0i8saa	Depersonalization has different triggers for everyone who experiences it. For people with anxiety disorders it may proceed or follow any period of anxiety or panic regardless of where they are or who they are around. For others it is triggered by stressful events, like social events, of public events like giving a speech. Depersonalization is a common experience following trauma like a car accident and some people experience it only once and never again. Because of repeated childhood trauma I experience it almost all the time and have for over 30 years. The only time I don't experience it it when I am alone and have no stress.

6K1D6Azmaa	It is doubtful that will be of much help.The problem is the mold you cannot see, inside the walls, under the floors, and growing in the carpets. ?|`|5rsN7VsUaa	hello, no it will not. in fact the longer mold is in your home, painted over or not you will continue to grow worse where your health is concerned.|`|inST4SlAaa	Getting mold off your walls can be difficult, but even more difficult is keeping it off.  Not only does the mold look unsightly but if present in large quantities (called colonies), it can even put your health at risk. <br>   to remove mold from your walls, first try to find out where it's coming from.  First, look for areas that are moist such as condensation on windows, cracking of walls, warped wood or musty odors.  Then find out if your neighbors also have mold on their walls. If you live in an apartment and your neighbors have mold on their walls the problem could be caused by ‘moisture barriers’ that were, either not properly installed or not installed in the walls and under the slab floor.<br>  The solution for the first problem is to clean up the problem and repair any areas where there is water coming into the house. <br>  a quick temporary solution is to start the cleaning process, scrubbing off the mold and end every damaged source of water that may be directly or indirectly causing the mold through leakage. Mix a household cleaner with hot water and scrub affected areas, after that mix undiluted chlorine bleach on a sponge and scrub the mold directly.   a more permanent way is to remove the siding and install a moisture barrier with the right appropriate materials, like sheet vinyl or aluminum foil wrap.  And, again, use a bleach/water mixture and scrub the mold directly.  <br>   to remove mold caused by flooding you'll need to get rid of all the drywall, to at least 12 inches above the high water mark. Inspect the internal of the walls to make sure you've removed all mold-infested drywall. Then, allow the area to dry for 2-3 days, and sanitize with the bleach solution before putting new drywall back.|`|Th1EmKVtaa	Sure.

When you menstruate, your body is shedding the lining of the uterus (womb). Menstrual blood flows from the uterus through the small opening in the cervix, and passes out of the body through the vagina. Most menstrual periods last from three to five days.|`|gFKbY9mmaa	OK first of all ur gonna have cramps on ur back and will grow hair on ur down part under arm and legs more than usaul. u will devolope breasts too. and buy tampons because u will get blood <br>  <br>  ps make sure to change it!|`|htkIXHEjaa	There's nothing to it.

Zwpagpubaa	Are you sure it isn't something red you ate yesterday?  If you ate something red yesterday it could just be food.  I would watch for a couple of days to see if it happens again with out eating any red foods.  <br>  If you had no red foods in the last couple of days, it could be hemorrhoids ( up inside).  They will cause bleeding especially if you have been constipated.|`|inST4SlAaa	When a patient says he sees blood in the stool he is rarely wrong. The only thing that he can confuse with fresh blood (hematochezia) is a red dietary pigment that might escape digestion. The pigment in beets, if eaten in large quantities, can produce a dark red stool; this is more common in children than in adults. I suppose that other red dietary pigments could cause confusion too. If you are in doubt you can ask if the blood diffuses into the water of the toilet bowl. Fresh blood diffuses rather rapidly and turns the water a familiar light yellowish pink-red color, while beet pigment goes into solution without a change in color. <br>  <br>  Many people know that black stools (melena) can mean blood in the stool, so when a patient says he sees blood you should ask if he means black blood, red blood, or something in between ("dark blood"). Blood turns black in the gut lumen because reduced hemoglobin is dark and because bacteria alter the porphyrin pigments. Most of this conversion occurs in the right colon where the colonic bacteria are most active. Thus if blood in the stool looks entirely fresh, its source is the distal one-third of the colon; if it is completely black, its source is likely to be above the cecum; if it is mixed black and red, the source is somewhere in between. This rule holds for low to moderate rates of bleeding. Large-volume bleeding above the cecum creates a loose watery stool because of the osmotic effect of the blood constituents. The flushing of the colon does not give the bacteria time to convert the hemoglobin completely from red to black. Still, the blood rarely looks entirely fresh even in large-volume bleeding from above the cecum. <br>  <br>  Black stools can also result from the ingestion of iron, bismuth (usually in Pepto-Bismol), and the excessive intake of spinach and other greens that are cooked and eaten in large quantities by vegetarians and enthusiasts for "ethnic” diets. You must ask about such medicines and foods when you see a patient who complains of black stools.|`|m3NVpPpiaa	You could have tore your you know what a little. It could also be a hemorrhoid, they can and will bleed at times. If the color of your feces is or was really dark in color, like black or blackish, that would indicate blood in the feces. That would warrant a visit to the doctor.<br>  <br>  If you continue to see blood in the toilet and on the paper, go see your doctor. Good luck to you.|`|zLkIGe5Taa	Knowing your age is important.  The older you are, the more concerned we are regarding colon cancer.<br>  <br>  Bright red blood is called hematochezia.  It can signal a anal fissure (crack in the anus), hemorrhoids, diverticulosis, polyps or colon cancer.  Dark stools is called melena and are suggestive of bleeding higher up in the intestines.<br>  <br>  If it hurts when you wipe, it is more suggestive or a fissure or hemorrhoid.  If you are over 50 years old you should get a colonscopy.  If you notice the bleeding is continuing you should get worked up by a doctor.|`|a3O3yfnJaa	Statistically speaking, this is probably just hemorrhoids, or tearing from a hard stool (if indeed your stool was hard) or even anal intercourse.  Most people have hemorrhoids at one point or another.  No matter which of these things it probably is, you'll want to make sure you're eating lots of fiber (veg, whole grains, fruit) and drinking lots of water.  That will make the stool softer and easier to pass.  If your anus is sore, try Tucks or some witch hazel on a piece of TP.  But blood on the stool can mean polyps, benign or cancerous, which can lead to internal bleeding, so it is a good idea to talk to your doctor soon just to rule that out; your age is a likely factor here (you can get colon cancer as a young person but it is more likely over 40 and much more over 50).

XayiqDyUaa	The best are what are considered negative calorie foods. <br>  <br>  Fat-burning meat foods: Lean Beef, Chicken, Turkey, Pork, Buffalo, etc. Pretty much all lean meats help to speed up the metabolism and burn more fat simply because they require so much energy for complete digestion. Studies have shown that people who follow a high-meat/high-protein diet burn twice as many calories AFTER a meal as people who follow a high-carbohydrate diet. (Note: For the most part, only certain types of fish are considered to be negative calorie foods - most meat simply contains too many calories to fit the bill.)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Fat-burning fish foods: Salmon, Tuna, and Sardines. These foods all contain large amounts of omega-3 fatty acids which, besides being incredibly healthy, seems to have a strong effect on metabolism. Omega-3 fats (the healthiest of 'good fats') alters levels of a body hormone called leptin which directly influences metabolism and determines whether you burn calories or store them as fat. Basically, the less leptin you have in your bloodstream the more calories you use for energy. Cold-water fish and omega-3 oils like flax seed oil - which is definitely a strong fat-burning food - have been shown to significantly lower leptin levels and improve metabolism.|`|eHiwylo7aa	faux meat or no meat.. :)|`|aJGAXYUIaa	whole grains maybe etc|`|8cWXhZGjaa	fish|`|k2NRCYo9aa	Chicken, fish, roast beef, buffalo.

AA12266052	There are two types of lung cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The names simply describe the type of cell found in the tumours.<br>  In NSCLC, the tumour is often located in the outside part of the lung, away from the centre, and if it has not spread, it may be possible to remove it by surgery.<br>  However, overall less than a fifth of all NSCLC patients are suitable for surgery.<br>  Chemotherapy and radiotherapy will also be considered in many cases.<br>  Unfortunately, NSCLC is hard to cure, and in many cases, the treatment given will be to prolong life as far as possible - and relieve symptoms. <br>  If the biopsy reveals you do have lung cancer, more imaging tests will be done to determine the stage of the cancer. Stage means how big the tumor is and how far it's spread. Non-small cell lung cancer is divided into five stages:<br>  <br>      * Stage 0 - the cancer has not spread beyond the inner lining of the lung<br>      * Stage I - the cancer is small and hasn't spread to the lymph nodes<br>      * Stage II - the cancer has spread to some lymph nodes near the original tumor<br>      * Stage III - the cancer has spread to nearby tissue or spread to far away lymph nodes<br>      * Stage IV - the cancer has spread to other organs of the body such as the other lung, brain, or liver|`|d456069f8e03a8bf7a79de76c7e45228aa	All cancer is staged according to disease progression. Cancer starts as a single cell that mutates . . from there the cell begins to grow indefinitely and begin to replicate itself. So cancer starts small and progresses to something larger, and continues constantly . . sometimes treatment can stop the progression of disease and sometimes it cannot.<br>  <br>  There are four stages to most cancers . . stage 1 is early cancer that is quite small . . a stage 2 would be a bit bigger . . a stage 3 refers to a larger tumor that may have multiplied and grown into tissue . .while a stage 4 always refers to Metastatic cancer . . at stage 4 the tumor is large, there are many, they have invaded tissue, and the original tumor has started to 'shed' hundreds of new malignant cells directly into the blood steam or lymphatic system. These new microscopic cells hitch a ride in the blood and can travel anywhere the blood goes . . in general the first place the new cancer cells go is the liver, the brain, or the lungs. Those new cancer cells than lodge and start up a whole new cancer colony in another part of the body . .this can happen all over the body until the body is over run with cancer.  This is why chemotherapy is used . . chemo goes directly into the blood stream and travels the same path as the metastatic cancer and is intended to kill off this microscopic danger.  There is no guarantee though unfortunately that chemo will work.<br>  <br>  The doctor knew what stage your mother was the minute the cancer spred . . it is automatically a stage IV or metastatic cancer once it leaves the original spot and travels to another location.|`|yu2q4tUiaa	First, I'm sorry about your mom.<br>  <br>  That's how it is with lung cancer. It is one of the most difficult to diagnose and to treat. Once dignosed, it is at its advanced stage more often than not. <br>  For more info about lung cancer, please see: <a href="http://www.your-cancer-prevention-guide.com/facts-about-lung-cancer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.your-cancer-prevention-guide....</a><br>  <br>  Yes, the doctor based the staging on examinations, lab results, etc. For further info on how staging is done, please see: <a href="http://www.your-cancer-prevention-guide.com/stages-of-cancer.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.your-cancer-prevention-guide....</a>|`|SQLSOeHcaa	I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR MOM:-(<br>  <br>  Yes!.... the doctor can tell the stage of a cancer and  how far a cancer has spread.  The tests and scans she has have will give some information about the stage.  It is important because treatment is often decided according to the stage of the cancer.  All staging for cancer includes information on the size of the tumor, whether there is cancer in the lymph nodes and whether the cancer has spread anywhere else.<br>  <br>  Best of luck to your mom:-)|`|B8yKpGUnaa	They can tell what stage it is by how advanced it is, through tests and sometimes even just through seeing it. Usually, the bigger the tumour and more spread out it is, the higher the stage. <br>  I'm so sorry :(

Oh yes, there will be people who want to criticize, must criticize.....but eventually you will learn they do this to make up for shortcomings in their own life. We internalize our disappointments/grief, etc.....others externalize by lashing out, blaming other, etc. <br>  <br>   I'm much like you and when criticized I will fume, fuss, even cry but eventually realize I am basically a good, loving person who must constantly fight low self esteem.   <br>  <br>  Maybe try this.......When you find yourself down, make a file on your computer, fill it with your rants, etc and then delete it.......when the computer asked if you want to permanently delete this file.....make the name a person or problem.........hit yes and delete.....flush that sucker away and start anew.  <br>  <br>  Start another file of good things you have done, your good points, start small, but record them.

2gUYz79baa	As previously said before, give your body a day for resting. Your schedule looks good though, Dont always work the same muscle out. Muscles likes ab's or leg's can worked on everyother day. Target 1 -2 muscles each day. To get a good workout, do 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions each exercise. For a good work-out, do 3-4 different exercises for each muscle. Here is my schedule if it helps 'ya out any..<br>  <br>  Monday- shoulders, abs, <br>  Tuesday- 8 mile run<br>  Wednesday-abs, triceps, back,<br>  Thursday-run, legs, biceps<br>  Friday-abs, Chest<br>  Saturday-shoulders, maybe some stuff you may have missed<br>  Sunday- Run, legs/ sometimes day off!|`|UZJ7wVc8aa	That's a good start. The key to starting an exercise routine is to make the changes slowly. You can't go from being sedentary to active overnight and hope to succeed. Start out by exercising 1-2 times per week and eventually moving up to 3-5 times per week. Only increase the amount of exercise you do per week when you feel ready.<br>  <br>  Exercise routines also have to be well rounded to be successful. You need elements of flexibility, cardiovascular and strength training. You don't need to go to the gym to get a good workout, but having access to that type of equipment is a definite plus. Flexibility isn't very intensive and can be done on most if not all days of the week. It won't directly help you with your goals but it will lead to better performance - it will make exercising a lot easier.<br>  <br>  Cardio should be done 3-5 times per week while strength training should be done 2-3 times per week. The more weight you want to lose, the more you need to exercise. If this seems confusing, you can get a free personalized workout routine at <a href="http://shtrainer.com" rel="nofollow">http://shtrainer.com</a>|`|bMZ7lOfVaa	You should take one day off a week though for resting your body and muscles.

Circulation is probably the biggest "repair" function your body has, whether by bringing nutrients through the blood or removing waste via the lymph system.  Gentle rubbing with the heat (circles) should help, like kneading dough.

cPQ7TBcuaa	If you are taking them every day at a relatively large dose, then you need to slowly taper off of them by reducing the amount of mgs that you take per day over a period of several days. It's hard, but you have to have some self control...you probably want to take all of them that you have within the first couple of days of getting them, but you need to get some and use them to taper off. If you have to, then get someone you trust to hold them for you and only dispense a certain amount to you every day...so you can gradually come off them. If you are on them heavy, then you may have to go to rehab or even a methadone clinic to get off of them. But to stay off them, lose contact with all of your connections! If you don't it will be too tempting to call someone up to get some if you are feeling down and out. Stay away from people who do them! The temptation is too big to be around it after you quit. Also, get a new hobby to keep your mind off of taking pills! And if you are getting them from a doctor, then cut ties with that doctor ASAP, call them up, while you are still motivated to quit, and tell them that you don't want to receive services from them anymore. I ended up having to go to a methadone clinic for about a year to get off of oxys...which are very similar to roxys.|`|YPufVLCUaa	you can find your answer in sources

Well the strange part is if such a cure is existing how is it possible you have not heard about it.<br>  <br>  Scientist Munir Khan (Note that he is not a doctor or does not have a PHD) claims he has such a cure. This is a big scam. So please stay away from it. I checked his site <a href="http://www.cancercurable.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.cancercurable.com/.</a> The claims in the site are totally unacceptable. He has not published any research material or made any claims in any international forums. The testimonials he publish is only for some minor diseases. There not even one cancer patient who is cured as he claims.<br>  <br>  Why this is a scam<br>  <br>  1) There is no legitimate background information about Munir Khan. There is no description of where he studied, graduated. How did he become a scientist, who gave him that label.<br>  2) The website looks like a perfect scam. The claims laid are totally without proof. The media articles that is said to be published looks completely fake. (There are even spelling mistakes in Business India article). Rest of the media proofs are also fake, none of them have newspaper heading's and surprisingly no links.<br>  3) There is no media report on any of the awards he claims to have received.<br>  4) The website does not even have a sponsor.<br>  5) Not even one testimonial of a cured cancer or any major disease. Testimonials claim that their overall health has improved. This can happen if i have some natural herbs and good food everyday.<br>  6) Not even one credible media has reported about it. All they show is made up advertisement stuff and its not news.<br>  <br>  Conclusion<br>  The probability is he is having a ayurvedic medicine with some herbs that helps in natural body revival and perhaps has no side effects. The rest of it is a hype. It is not a magical medicine. Please stay away from it. You may be better off with eating Tulsi leaves daily. But the point is he mostly would be targeting people who do not come online or check about these things before going into his trap.

hnzrB1AUaa	I got my braces on when I was 22, right before I was finishing my bachelor's and going into my master's degree program.  I have no problems, I am a supervisor in a professional environment, and no one has ever had issue with my braces.  If you're worried about what your girlfriend my think just ask her, but ultimately this is what you want to do--that is, have straight teeth.  You can still drink, eat, kiss, talk, etc. with braces, but it all takes just a little bit of time to get used to.  You just have to make sure to maintain your teeth by brushing, flossing, and using mouthwash.  When I eat, I generally eat with a fork, so that I can guide the food to the back of my teeth; therefore, no food in the teeth, and stay away from the dark liquids.  That is the best advice I have.  Well, and that you should really get the braces if you want to because i love that I made the decision to get them!|`|AA11967904	diadvantages you;'ll look  a little funny for a couple of years then you'll have perfect teeth.|`|aCrZRrEDaa	nothing much, really. i just took mine off! <br>  you won't be able to pronounce certain words clearly,<br>  food may get stuck in between it,<br>  you would have to brush your teeth more often,<br>  and sometimes, your upper lip can get stuck in between your teeth and the braces when u smile :)<br>  <br>  but you won't look awful though. you may even look cute <br>  and it (your teeth) will be perfect when its off.|`|3de86587fcbbaa08a7b5f2d46356eb44aa	i have braces, and have had them for about 1 year now, and they really arent that bad, they never get in the way of anything, and they are so worth it if you want straight teeth.

At 13 years of age, it will be somewhat painful for about a week after the procedure. Be sure to find out if the doctor who will perform the circumcision has done this on males of your age and older guys too. I believe that a circumcision on older males is VERY different from performing it on infants. Get several medical opinions before committing to the surgery. But, go ahead, get the circumcision. I think you'll be much happier with a "cut" dick, than the "uncut" one you currently have.|`|a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	Keeping the foreskin back can make it swell and cause it to get stuck, paraphimosis, which can be a medical emergency.<br>  Some guys have managed to retract permanently but they lose a lot of sensitivity and the advantages of having a foreskin.<br>  Adult males lose 15 square inches (40 square centimetres) of skin in circumcision, over half the skin of your penis. You lose the gliding action as it slides on itself during masturbation and sex. You will suffer bruising, perhaps some bleeding, and the swelling from the disruption to the lymph system goes on for up to six months. Removing the foreskin turns the surface of the glans from an inner mucosal membrane to outside skin. Newly circumcised adults usually go through some weeks of intense discomfort as the glans is constantly exposed to rubbing on clothing, until it develops a thicker keratin layer and becomes less sensitive. You must abstain from ALL sexual activity for an average of six weeks. Some men like the final result but others complain of loss of sensation and miss being able to slide their foreskin over the glans. Circumcised guys often have little or no movable skin left and are forced to masturbate using lube or rubbing dry, without the loose skin. There is no going back if you don’t like the result.<br>  A recent study has shown real differences in fine touch sensitivity between circumcised and intact penises and that the most sensitive parts of the intact penis are those that would be removed by circumcision.<br>  The claimed benefits of circumcision are a beat up (based on flawed studies) and don't really exist but medical authorities have worked out that the overall complication rate is higher than all the benefits claimed by the pro-cutting advocates. One by one the claims are disproved but the pro-cutting zealots come up with more and keep quoting the old ones despite the evidence against them. For example you have more chance of dying from a circumcision or losing your penis from infection than from penile cancer. The rate of penile cancer is higher in the largely-circumcised USA than in European countries where less than 1% of the male population is circumcised. Plus circumcised men have been found to have penile cancer, mostly on the scar. (Remember this is a very rare disease in intact or circumcised men).<br>  A very recent study in New Zealand followed a cohort of boys through life from birth to age 32. About 40% were circumcised. The intact males had a slightly lower rate of sexually transmitted infections than the circumcised but there was no significant difference.<br>  Using surgery to mutilate the genitals instead of washing in a modern western society makes no sense. Normal intact male genitals are, if anything, easier to wash than female ones and the same substance, smegma collects in the genital folds of both sexes. <br>  Many women who get to interact sexually with an intact penis prefer the natural state. Don’t do this to yourself just to fit in. Be proud of your whole and natural body.,<br>  Geoff|`|EwmHsEoiaa	This page gives you info:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  <br>  There is a good reason the foreskin is there.<br>  <br>  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.

LPO8RlVdaa	GET OFF THIS DIET NOW!!!! IT IS DANGEROUS!!!!<br>  <br>  I am a Nurse, so please please listen to me on this. email me if you like and I'll send you lots of info on ketoacidosis and all the negative side effects of this crappy diet.<br>  <br>  If you really want to lose weight, just adopt a healthy lifestyle.Eat a good healthy diet and excercise a lot!!! The more excercise you do the better!<br>  <br>  For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)<br>  <br>  Now for the science bit: Protien is essential for repairing muscle and keeping the muscle you do have healthy (this includes your heart, lungs, brain etc). You naturally lose the ammount of protien you have throughout the day (through urine etc) so this needs to be replenished regularly on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are essential for energy. You won't be able to function without it. It also regulates body fat and glucose etc.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and minerals are obviously essential for a variety of reasons. For normal growth and development, for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs that make up our bodies, and also to let us efficiently use chemical energy provided by food.<br>  <br>  You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.<br>  <br>  The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise. <br>  <br>  Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier. <br>  <br>  I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you. <br>  <br>  But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off. <br>  <br>  Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.<br>  <br>  There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.<br>  <br>  Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights. <br>  <br>  But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).<br>  <br>  Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.<br>  <br>  These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights. <br>  <br>  As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.|`|qzTLuuyeaa	well he himself was over weight when he died says a lot don't it.<br>  look around there is better diets out there|`|iUXnCGPPaa	The atkin diet doesn't work because your body NEEDS carbs to function. There's no sense in cutting them out because as soon as you start eating them again you'll gain all the weight back. It's much easier to lose weight by eating healthy and having portion control.

I do beleive that looks are important but not everything. It may not be cool, but it's a fact... when a person who wants to date and is out looking for that someone, more than likely they will walk-up/introduce themselves to what attracts them. Our looks play a good part when it comes to meeting new people but that's just the pull. Once you've pulled them to you, it is time to get to know more about who this person really is and if they are the one for you.  Being single is ok, don't stress too much over it, enjoy it while it last. If you realy don't want to be single any longer that's also ok, yet don't try to rush into it. Sometimes when we try to do things our way or rush something that should not be rushed, we tend to mess things all up. If you are out there looking, then try to change the order, let them find you. Also, back to your looks (which you're good there)... don't worry so much about looking good, you already do.  If you are always worried that you don't look good enough or if your hair, make-up, cothes, etc. are a hot mess, then you yourself might be making you look like a hot mess. I'm not saying that everyone, but as for myself, when I stress or worry (lets say about my looks), I get all envolved in try to fix it and look good that I don't notice that I'm acting somewhat stupid while trying to do all I can so that others will not see what I think I'm seeing... my hot mess, which to begin with was never there. I looked good when I left my house, looked good in my car and I'm sure I still look that way once I got to were I needed to be. Your head will play that game if you let it, Just know that you look great but don't get concided and don't stress over your looks. Go out, have fun, be yourself and others will see who you really are and not just your good looks.|`|Pj8bKWyWaa	I think you're awesome, you dress well, you take care of yourself, you got game girl.

ZaLrtSd7aa	No - and you can have genital and oral (cold sores) - most of the population has been exposed and is positive for it. A false negative would be more common if just infected as the body has not responded to it as of yet.|`|inST4SlAaa	If symptoms of herpes appear, they can vary widely from person to person. If a person does experience signs of infection, we recommend obtaining a culture test (a swab from the symptom) within the first 48 hours after a lesion appears. Results are usually available in about a week's time. <br>  <br>  The major advantage of the culture is its accuracy in giving a positive result. A culture can also be “typed” to determine whether the infection is caused by HSV-1 or HSV-2. If you test positive by viral culture, you can be sure you have the virus.<br>  <br>  The major disadvantage of the culture is its high rate of false negatives. Because a culture works by requiring virus that is active, if a lesion is very small, or is already beginning to heal, there may not be enough virus present for an accurate culture. Beyond 48 hours of the symptoms appearing, there is a risk of receiving a false negative test result. Viral culture is even less accurate during recurrences (positive in only about 30% of recurrent outbreaks).|`|9TyEDcRzaa	it is a disease that it does not heal or have any second infection ---also the positive once is positive  till the immunity develops  to become the illness to vanish --if then tested you get a false positive|`|wETQbPxGaa	no

I have also notice all the questions. I'm sure most if not everyone has been around to see when a guy has gotten hit in the balls. Try to recall what you saw & the poor guys reaction. I know I wasn't there with you when this happened but I can say that I somewhat know how this guy reacted and from that you should not even have to ask.  HELL YES, it HURTS!  You ask why it hurts... it just does! You get hit in any part of the body... it's gonna hurt some. Some spots of our body or body parts are more sensitive than others. For us guys, our most sensitive part is our balls... so again, it just hurts. Some guys do cry, others don't. I've gotten hit hard & yes, tears flowed. Not all guys fall to the ground, but if our balls were to receive a good blow, then the possibilities are that we'll go down. I also read that someone, think it was a girl wanted to know how it feels. That is just something that can not be put into words. I do know that the vagina is also a very sensitive part in females... do it yourself, maybe get a friend or if you need, I'm willing to give you a good kick, punch, slap, or whatever in the crotch... getting the feel of it first hand is the best way to find out what getting hit in the balls is like.|`|gKgSapaRaa	AMEN!! i agree.....i think every idiot that asks that question should be banged in the balls to see if it hurts or if it makes em cry!<br>  <br>  u dont do ne of that stuff....it hurts....thats it.......floor dropping and crying is uunnecessary

7obFZ2Gyaa	No. I do 3-4 sets of 20-30 reps  with 70 lbs  I feel  like my stomach is alot  stronger but   I look and I sitll have  fat or flab on my stomach.   Cardio exercise like running , jogging, basketball games,  tennis, or  treadmill will burn the fat off the stomach area. I am in the predicament though  the only place I have  alot  of fat is my stomach area so I don't do alot of cardio maybe  boxing which is hard work. I swim for exercise in the summer time and that is cardio as well.   I am trying to gain weight so thats why I don't  do alot of cardio maybe 1-2 times a week.  I hope I helped !!|`|apN4UYyKaa	they tone your stomach but to loose fat everywhere you need to do cario|`|4mcFd5Juaa	No. You will tone your abs, but you need to do cardio to burn off the fat which lays on top of  your muscles.|`|vxMJwivPaa	it helps<br>  but you need to do other exercising <br>  running is great<br>  and so is dance
7mCCAqXzaa	the experation date on condoms are like 2-3 years so if you hold a condom for that long it probibly has been exposed to various heat and cold tempretures and abuse. if it did not break chances are that it is okay and there should be no problems. condoms should not be carried in wallets or heat of the car and used by the experation date<br>  <br>  <br>  curtdude|`|ZRu2DxEqaa	All condoms have an expiration date on the back of their wrapper. Its always printed on it. They are more likely to break and cause an irritation since usually the lubricant on them usually drys up. So it is more likely that it will be more painful too. If the sperm stays in the condom i'm honestly not sure if your going to get pregnant since I have never used an expired one.|`|iUXnCGPPaa	I think if its past the expiration date it has a greater risk of breaking. If you're worried and it's been recent, go get the morning after pill from a pharmacy. Better safe than sorry :)|`|1cDo3REBaa	if it stays in the condom you got nothing to worry about<br>  <br>  they have an expiry date but that doesn't mean they WILL break if you use them after this, just alot more likely to

Try ti find a study patner that way you can get notes and things and study for test and things so you well not get overwhelmed on falling behind.|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	yeah therapy is important especially if your GP told you to go, i know it sucks but if it helps then at least you benefit from something, just catch up as best you can, i also have to go to therapy and am missin my GCSE work so i know how you feel... therapy wont last forever though (hopefully)|`|xnZi0i8saa	If your doctor recommended therapy there must be a reason why. Ask your mom and your therapist if they can schedule appointments later in the day after school. Most kids want to get out of school..... it is admirable that you are concerned about it. Talk to your mo and your doctor.

7d7873da0c168e2a1cbda90dc29fd444aa	If you really want to be a pediatrician, then go for it. Don't let fear of chemistry and math get in your way. If you are deciding between being a pediatrician and something else, do your research first and make sure that you are going after what you really want. Find some pediatricians and ask them for tips and advice. See what their typical day is like, and whether you think it is really worth your time. Do what you love to do.

OnDIrxNEaa	Not sure if you use pads or tampons, but pads could be the cause.  They trap the moisture from your period against your vagina, which breeds bacteria.  I have been prone to yeast infections since I was very young, so my gyno advised me not to use pads/pantiliners.  Also be sure to wear all cotton panties, try to avoid thongs.  When I'm not on my period I sleep without panties, to let my vagina "breathe."|`|d78253b3026406d31c9242c83af40176aa	The SAME thing has been happening to me. I wear pads, and I swear its the pads!! Its just started happening though over the last year. I've had my period for 10 years now and never have had this problem.<br>  <br>  I dont know if they're using different chemicals in the pads or something. I find that ALWAYS pads dont make it happen as bad as some other pads that i've tried. But it still happens.<br>  <br>  Good luck!! Maybe talk to your doctor about it. <br>  <br>  Over the counter things usually work. Also eating YOGURT. Yogurt helps produce good bacteria and will help prevent a yeast infection.|`|A9gUSxQAaa	I get yeast infections all the time because im a dancer & wear tights for long periods of time.  You can prevent them by eating yogurt with probiotics, not eating sugary foods, and wearing cotton panties.  Don't wear tight fitting pants, & when you exercise make sure you wear breathable clothes.  Ask your doctor for more tips.  If your yeast infection isen't going away you may have to go to the doctor so he can give you perscription cream. Hope I helped! :)|`|7zBUVlccaa	Im not an expert, but im guessing you should just- <br>  wear clean panties when you get in from school/work. Basically, change twice/three times a day. <br>  Wash and shower more reguarly.. <br>  <br>  Basically, just keep clean. It should go away eventually, but if your really worried, go see a doctor (: <br>  Its not deadly, so dont worry.. just relax, and wait for it to go away :D<br>  <br>  gooood lucckk! <br>  ~rweo x
Knkjtsl7aa	A retainer is so much easier than an expander. The expander hurts because they are widening your mouth. The retainer holds the space that was expanded. They will more than likely have to do impressions for your retainer though. Just try to breath through your nose. If you can look down so it doesn't feel like it's going to the back of you throat. If you freak out and start screaming and crying it only makes it worse for you and can take longer. Just relax.It's not that bad!|`|TdLuyP7Zaa	No it doesn't hurt getting a retainer on. The only time it does hurt is if you don't wear it for a while.

It would make people with Tourette's normal again, make the horrible thrashing and twithching and yelling and the whole disorder--it would vanish as soon as they swallowed the pill.

Better reflexes, a little itch under their skin would remain that made them get up and do something, an urge for physical activity.|`|8TPqBEGEaa	One that could instantly cure cancer the moment it was taken.

luCReaXcaa	I have a good friend, also on lots of meds, with your type of problems.  I asked him (and now you) to ask the doctor for a 6 week prescription for Testim or Androgel (both are HRT for Testosterone).

Note: this stuff is made for males over age 18, especially over the age of 50.|`|khgwEYfQaa	it almost certainly is your meds. have a word with your gp. explain the situation and maybe he could change them for you.<br>  ?|`|cRxoNPYkaa	I have this problem sometimes, love the person, love the sex, no problem with the erection... sometimes my adult ADD finds its way into the bedroom and my mind starts to wander.

I would recommend an A1C which would give you a 3 month average.  Instead of going to the doctor you can pick up a kit at Wal-Mart for about nine dollars. It is a little inconvenient though, I am reasonably sure you have to mail it in to get the results.  Good luck.|`|n3wTiKFqaa	Go to your GP and tell them that you are having problems, they will be able to tell you if it is the medecation you are currently taking and they will be able to help you otherwise.

Could be allergies as well.|`|TFKh5U5jaa	you probably have an infection in your throat which has caused some plaques in your throat. go to the doctor and do a strep test|`|Wmrgj4Caaa	i think i know why, i have this problem often. It could be that you have a tonsil stone. If you open up your mouth in look in the corners next to your uvula, you should see some white thing poking out, or apperaing.

Are you on any medications?<br>  <br>  If this blood pressure continues, I would have my doctor check it out and get his opinion, on it.<br>  <br>  When you get up and feel dizzy,  this is termed orthostatic hypotension.  What you need to do, is get up very slowly and sit at the side of the bed for a few minutes before getting up when rising.<br>  <br>  I am a retired nurse|`|jUEim6Hsaa	No your grandmother is wrong your blood pressure just a little under normal not a big deal. Your systolic levels (first number) are a little low but your young you dont have to worry.|`|5xnWdlTxaa	Low blood pressure (LBP), also called hypotension, would seem to be something to strive for. After all, high blood pressure (hypertension) is a well-known risk factor for heart disease and other problems. In fact, in recent years there has been an ongoing downward revision of what is considered a normal blood pressure reading. A blood pressure less than 120/80 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) is now considered normal and optimal for good health.|`|zLkIGe5Taa	That blood pressure is great.  Anything lower than 120/80 is considered healthy.  Your lower blood pressure is even better unless you are having problems with dizziness or lightheadedness.|`|RwEpGG4caa	Your BP is little bit low....it shd be around 110/65....but it depend how u took the BP (what time of the day, position sitting or standing)...it is nothing to be worried about...but do talk to ur doc about ur symptoms..<br>  <br>  hope this helps
04Te5gzzaa	Usually true.  A group plan usually gets a discounted rate because it is a volume sale for the insurance company.  But there might be some drawbacks to a group plan like some types of coverages may be different depending on the situation/sickness.  A group plan usually offers the most "popular" options, like a low deductible, prescriptions, low co-pay, etc..but they can't me modified to your individual needs.  An individual plan you can customize what you want depending on many factors.  HMO, PPO, co-pay amount, prescription coverage, deductible amount, etc...  If you're a healthy person and your company is reputable, I'd go for the group plan and save yourself some $$$.

aiBOMU9kaa	That depends on whether your old lenses are big enough to be recut into the new frame without affecting the optical center placement too much.<br>  <br>  The lenses always have to be recut, so the old ones must be bigger.<br>  <br>  Sure they will charge you. Could be from 10 to maybe 25.00 $|`|Dh5CUjmkaa	That depends on where you go to get the new frames. If you have a current prescription, and your lenses are the current prescription, Wal Mart should let you purchase a new frame that is similar in size and shape to your old frames. I really do not know about other places because I use the Wal Mart vision center. They usually are pretty good about helping someone out who has a problem similar to yours. Wal Mart will make you purchase the frames, but not charge you to put the lenses in.

mXB6vy6xaa	Fever usually means the body is fighting off an infection.  If the fever is 99-102 or so, I would say the body is doing OK fighting it off, but if her temp. goes up to 103 or 104 or higher, you should consider getting her some medical attention pretty quick.  <br>  Is she having nausea? The flu is usually accompanied by nausea.<br>  Body aches and weakness in the limbs could be due to the fever, but if she is experiencing tingling sensations in her limbs this could be a circulation problem which would indicate a more serious problem.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't want medical attention, I would try aspirin or Tylenol something to keep the fever under control and possibly relieve the body aches.  Clear liquids are also good for her.  Sprite or Seven Up usually helps settle their stomach, and a good broth to keep her energy level up.  <br>  Good luck, watch the fever and make sure it doesn't get too high.  Infections can come on quick and last 24 hours, or can linger for 7-10 days, it just depends on her health and what bug she caught.<br>  If she does have nausea, do not let her get dehydrated, or this will cause many more complications.

inST4SlAaa	Follow your doctor's instructions about how and when to use ZOVIRAX eye ointment.<br>  ZOVIRAX eye ointment is usually applied five times a day - about every four hours while you are awake. See below for how to apply.<br>  Do not touch the nozzle of the eye ointment or the eye ointment as it comes out of the tube. Wash your hands well with soap and dry them thoroughly before you apply the eye ointment.<br>  With your finger under the bottom eye lid, pull the skin down gently so that the bottom eye lid comes down creating a little pocket between the eye and the eye lid. Put 10mm (1cm, just under half an inch) of ointment into this pocket. Release the eye lid (stop pulling it) and blink a couple of times to spread the ointment across the eye.<br>  <br>  How long to use ZOVIRAX eye ointment<br>  Keep using for at least three days after the eye infection has gone.<br>  <br>  If you forget a dose of ZOVIRAX eye ointment<br>  If you forget a dose of ZOVIRAX eye ointment use it as soon as you remember, then continue to use approximately every four hours.<br>  It is important not to miss many doses of ZOVIRAX - it needs to be used regularly to work properly.

It would also show a lot of swelling.<br>  <br>  I suggest you apply cold compresses to it and just rest it, to avoid making it worse.|`|BT3byMiLaa	I htink you should just ice it.|`|yotafojtaa	It doesn't sound like a fracture, you probably just pulled a muscle or a tendon in your hand. usually when someone breaks a bone they physcially can't bend or move the joint (I know because that's what happened when I fractured my elbow) so it should be fine :) maybe go to the doctor in a few days if it's not better, and see what they say.|`|I3wY7wD9aa	I believe that if your hand was fractured - you would KNOW it. It is more than likely a sprain or just bruised muscles.  First try taking some pain meds  (anti inflammatory) for a day. If it continues to swell and get extremely painful - it would be best for you to have it x-rayed. Good luck - I'm sure it hurts.|`|fJOVCqrqaa	When you get a fracture, you can't move without feeling a lot of pain. I have the same thing u have right now but in my toes, and as u said, it hurts when u push hard against something but it's not a fracture.|`|Ej9JQa4saa	Your hand is swelling in response to the injury. You said it is not black or blue so it can not be a bruise so I would ice it for a for a few hours and if the swelling does not go down you should really see a doctor.|`|YAhD85h2aa	You really don't need to go get an xray. Its a sprain. If it was fractured you'd have much more pain and you would not be able to move it. Just ice it. Get a bucket and put your hand in there. You'll be good in a day or two.|`|Vmp1KK1iaa	Swollen is bad. if it was bruised it wouldn't be swollen, it would just hurt a lot. Go to the doctor it sounds to me like a fracture, because I've fractured my arms and legs before.And I've done a lot more injuries to myself....I'm clumsy.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	Wrap your hand in a bandage and put ice on it. That should help with the swelling and soreness. If it is fractured it will heal on it's own.|`|iAABwDvAaa	Hey, maybe u should ask a medical professional for help, maybe an x-ray would help, yes?? MMMMMHMMMM. Let your insurance cover the damage!|`|pksLpEvPaa	u probabley spraned it thats what usally happens if it was broken it woulda turned black n blue n get very swollen u should be ok since u can move it as well 2....but u never no it might be bad as well..|`|kfiYypHFaa	I think it's just a bit bruised.|`|qZXIm3Ksaa	put ICE on it 3 times a day and take some pain medication!! the swelling causes nerve and muscle damage eventually!! if you can still move it then it's not broken but if the ice and medicine hasn't helped in 2 days then go to the doctor. :/

Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|sL4Z5WvTaa	I really recommend WeightWatchers and exercising 3/4 times a week. These are the only things that work for me.
6k5fhFyBaa	I don't, but I work in health care, and it's rare that a seizure is caused by sleep deprivation. If there is one, it's usually because the deprivation is being caused by the use of illegal stimulant drugs which keep one up for days at a time. Are you looking for additional information?
510MC9SVaa	First off, no don't take "left over" antibiotics. You shouldn't have any left over antibiotics. It is very important to take all the antibiotics that are perscribed. Otherwise you risk having the infection come back. It kills all the weak germs, but not the stronger ones. I suggest you go to the doc and have them check out your ear. You could have a big old roach or spider in there. Or it could be the start of an ear infection.
C2DaufUYaa	Aloe vera gel..or cocca shea butter!|`|CpevWaQ7aa	Bio-oil and a good moistuiser|`|HHPha1J0aa	Stretch marks can be quite hard to get rid of completley but you can make them appear less visable and fade them<br>  Have you heard of cocoa butter fomula? you can get this at most chemists such as boots or superdrug they are for stretchmarks and they help them to fade although im not sure if they will get rid of them completley but they should if you carry on using look better as it tightens the skin and flattens out the marks.<br>  I think Laser treatment would get rid of them on a permanent basis but it can cost alot of money<br>  I hope this helpsx
vrYaWe1Caa	It takes time to lose some weight. Are you drinking enough water? Make sure you are so that you can flush out water weight and it helps to lose body fat. If you were to be dehydrated, your body fat will increase because your body will hold on to everything to keep it from dehydration. If you were to be hydrated, you might have lost some body fat because you have been exercising and eating healthy. So in my perspective, water weight cannot be measured as fat because it's a liquid and fat isn't.|`|jw6Lpt37aa	hi , always give your diet time to get the effect of the healthy eating you are keeping doing it and try to weight yourself every 2 weeks  and in the morning before eating your breakfast to give you the accurate scale to your weight best of luck|`|TrTfowAQaa	no water retention is not counted on body fat ...and if you have a scale that guessed your body fat it's not right... having a fitness trainer do a skin fold is the third most accurate way to get your body fat% anyway... taking pills may change the numbers on your scale but only good food and hard workouts will change your body compisition and/or help you get healthy/in shape...|`|9ayocLWpaa	You cannot judge a weight loss plan after 2 days. You have to give it time and see if it  works for you.  If slimquick is supposed to help water retention it wont work in 2 days.
1E1m0ZOFaa	You should NEVER ever try and lose that much weight in that amount of time. You could try it, but it would be very hard and wouldn't you get fed up with the taste? Try joining a gym if you already don't have a half active life style, or try wii fit (preferably a gym) work out 3-5 times a week. I'm not guaranteeing that you'll lose that much weight that quick, but with the right diet and exercises those pounds will be dropping!|`|wPWNLMtVaa	Swimming Daily...|`|LPO8RlVdaa	NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO!!!!!!!!! AND FOR CRYING OUT LOUD NO!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  For gods sake, you will be starving yourself of essential nutrients!!! Losing weight healthily does not involve starving yourself!<br>  <br>  Forget about losing weight. Just adopt a healthy lifestyle.Eat a good healthy diet and excercise a lot!!! The more excercise you do the better!<br>  <br>  For a healthy diet, you need to be eating small to medium meals regularly. 4 or even 5 times a day. Each meal (apart from breakfast which should preferably be fibre rich), should contain a balanced ammount of carbohydrates for energy, (from potatoes, rice and pasta, etc) protien (from fish, chicken, occassional red meat is fine, soya is good too) and plenty of vitamins, minerals and antioxidants (simple fresh fruit and veg). Eat like this and make sure you are well hydrated (fruit juice is as good as water, any fluid counts, but some fluids have negative effects too, such as alcohol or caffiene rich drinks.)<br>  <br>  Now for the science bit: Protien is essential for repairing muscle and keeping the muscle you do have healthy (this includes your heart, lungs, brain etc). You naturally lose the ammount of protien you have throughout the day (through urine etc) so this needs to be replenished regularly on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  Carbohydrates are essential for energy. You won't be able to function without it. It also regulates body fat and glucose etc.<br>  <br>  Vitamins and minerals are obviously essential for a variety of reasons. For normal growth and development, for the healthy maintenance of the cells, tissues, and organs that make up our bodies, and also to let us efficiently use chemical energy provided by food.<br>  <br>  You can have a wide range of healthy meals with this, from Thai, Chinese, Italian, British, Indian, etc. Just make sure each meal contains balanced ammounts of these three. On the bright side too, fresh veg and rice and pasta is a lot cheaper than crappy junk food!<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean you cant have chocolate or pizza/takeaway/etc, just save them as very occassional treats.<br>  <br>  The big secret to keeping a healthy weight and staying healthy is EXCERCISE, particularly cardio excercise. <br>  <br>  Cardio exercise includes any form of excercise such as running/jogging/swimming/cycling etc that gets your heart rate pumping and you sweating and out of breath. It will not only burn calories and reduce your body fat levels, therefore making you 'slimmer' by having less fat on you, but will also improve your resting heart rate and lung function, making you healthier. <br>  <br>  I cannot understate the importance of cardio excercise. It is this which will basically burn the body fat off you. <br>  <br>  But you have to remember that once you have shed a bit of fat you have to have a nice toned body underneath the fat to show off. <br>  <br>  Strength training will help you strengthen and tone your muscles. This is done with the use of weights or by free training.<br>  <br>  There are essentially (without getting overly complicated) two types of strength excercises based on different types of muscle fibres depending on wether you want to build size, bulk and power, or just 'tone' up the lean muscles an get more muscle endurance.<br>  <br>  Heavy weights with short reps/sets will build your fast twitch muscle fibres and build size, power and strength. Imagine big guys at the gym lifting heavy weights. <br>  <br>  But if you use light to medium weights with lots of reps/sets you will excercise your slow twitch muscle fibres, you wont build size, but you will tone up your body and train muscle endurance. This will obviously make you 'look' healthier and more toned, but will also increase your metabolism (as your muscles demand more energy) so you will burn calories faster. These muscles are also excercised a lot with cardio workouts (i.e your leg muscles when running).<br>  <br>  Your arms for example, will need bicep curls and tricep dips using weights and reps of your choice (heavy - low reps, light - lots of reps) and also shoulder excercises such as holding the weights at your waist and lifting them perpendicular to your side or in front of you, etc etc.<br>  <br>  Your stomach will need excercises that cover the entire torso. Leg raises for your lower ab wall, crunches, sit ups and planks for your upper and all over ab wall, oblique twists for your sides and superman stretches for your lower back for example.<br>  <br>  These are just basic examples, there are literally hundreds of excercises, but it is impossible to show you on a site like this, get a trainer at your gym to show you some but remember the basic rules of muscles and weights. <br>  <br>  As far as excercise goes, you should aim to strike a balance between cardio training and strength training, this way you will build good strong and toned muscle, but also keep your body fat levels down and increase your heart and lung performance, making you much fitter and healthier.|`|qYgXwYXNaa	well...........................aham........ a gd diet 2 go on. go 4 it, but member what ever diet u go on u hav 2 excercise

d34NoSGhaa	My husband just did this. He got a disk with the CT scan the same day and I took it to the doctor the next day. We are just waiting on the doctor to call us to make an appointment.

4pw7zlRHaa	Hun, usually there is a reason why you start having your eating disorder in the first place.. Forget the food, think hard, and really ask yourself, what REALLY is bothering me? I have suffered with anorexia since I was 9, i'm 22 years old now. What has helped me is when I try to realize what really is bothering me, usually the not eating, etc will be because i'm hiding feelings.. What is making you stressed, what is making you take your anger out at yourself? What is happening in your life? Once you figure that out, you can focus on that and trying to make yourself feel better. Whether your made at school, or your parents, or whatever, try to find out what it is and deal with that, try not to take it out on your body, and yourself..|`|az2udhytaa	Listen, Im 15 and I know people who suffered from eating disorders. Your a beautiful person remember that. E-mail me and well talk. <br>  Just dont do it.|`|4db6Rzyyaa	You are a strong girl. I am 16 and I know people who have suffered from eating disorders. Everyone feels down sometimes and like they are worthless. You are not. Don't cave to the medias unrealistic views on how girls bodies should be. Look at real people and then look of people on TV you will see a drastic difference.
gnhl6hXYaa	hi[:<br>  i think teal and pink are nice colors but i dont really know how they would look together... i always get my braces single colored.. i think double colors look a little odd sometimes... so for me do one color at a time :D<br>  dark colors make your teeth look whiter (if your teeth aren't the whitest) ex: black, blue, navy-dark blue, purple<br>  green might look okay but from far away it might look like you have something in your teeth<br>  white: it looks pretty cool but just brush right after you drink or eat because they get stained easily<br>  clear: if you don't want your braces to be noticeable okay but these stain super fast so i wouldn't recommend these<br>  pastel/light colors: they look okay but once they fade they look sorta weird<br>  yellow/orange: yellow makes it look like if your teeth are dirty and depending on what kind of orange you get by the end of the month it will sorta fade and look like yellow...<br>  hope this helped<br>  -andrea<3|`|AA11263103	I already answer the same question..again... pink and teal would be a pretty colors.. And that is good that your getting the early. Its worth the pain too.
haabfMtkaa	Sue I am very sorry I know how tough it is on the family I have not heard of "Aquarius" before but that does not mean that it is not a good place the best advice I have for you is to get into some treatment for yourself to help you deal with the issue of having a alcoholic loved one I have found Al-anon to be very affective what worked for me is AA but as long as your husband is serious and realizes that he no longer has control of his addiction and is willing to stop trying to control it(because we cant as addicts)and give it to god follow the steps that he will learn in treatment then he will be OK it is a long hard road but the bumps get less a few and far between try AL-anon it helps you deal with it.Give it to god cause you cant control it and you cant change it pray that he is ready to let go of the control because if he thinks all he has to do is put the plug in the jug believe me that plug will pop no one chooses to create this kayos and drama he is not choosing this he has lost control and the quicker he figures this out the sooner he will be on his way to a sober happy life don't give up with love and support you will get through this remember he is sick he has an illness GOOD LUCK here is the link for AL-anon<br>  www.al-anon.alateen.org<br>  <br>  <br>  If you can get him to AA that is a start go online to find a fellowship near you they are free and the people there have been in yours an your husbands shoes they are excepting and willing to help in fact that is part of there own treatment helping other alcoholics. It was a lot easier for me to talk to someone who had gone through it and made it to the other side they show you by working the steps and living one day at a time even one moment at a time you can live a sober life witch is a hard thing for your husband to see right now I know that if he had a choice he would be done with all this but he is past that point of choice he now needs to learn how to live sober again how to deal with life with out a drink<br>  You can go to a book store and get the some info on the program and the 12 steps the names are "the big book" "the twelve step traditions" I hoped I have helped I really feel for you please feel free to contact me if you need to talk more about this you are not alone go to AL-anon it will help you need to think about you too!:)<br>  www.recoverysuperstore.com<br>  www.e-aa.org
z5JkgFOyaa	Glands inside a girl/woman’s vagina and cervix make small amounts of fluid. This fluid flows out of the vagina each day, carrying out old cells that have lined the vagina. This is your body's way of keeping your vagina healthy and clean. The discharge is usually clear or milky and doesn't smell bad.<br>  <br>  The color and thickness of the discharge change with your monthly cycle. The discharge is thicker when you ovulate (when one of your ovaries releases an egg), when a woman is breastfeeding or when a woman is sexually excited.<br>  <br>  Changes that may signal a problem include an increase in the amount of discharge, a change in the color or smell of the discharge, and irritation, itchiness or burning in or around your vagina. This is called vaginitis. A discharge that's stained with blood when you're not having your period could also be a sign of a problem.  Some other types of infections such as yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis and trichomoniasis can also cause discharge that is usually accompanied by odor such as beer/yeast/fish.<br>  <br>  I would recommend that if you have any of these signs or any concerns regarding this you consult with your doctor for a proper diagnosis and for proper treatment should you have anything other than just a normal vaginal discharge.<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|nAK8bm91aa	Urinary tract infection, STD, Chlamydia|`|IKwO4aixaa	You are gambling with your health to try and diagnose this yourself.<br>  <br>  No one should be buying yeast infection cures without having had a doctor visit first - even if you've had one before.<br>  <br>  Whether or not you are sexually active, many funky things happen and only a doctor can properly treat you - not anyone here on Yahoo!<br>  <br>  Please see your doc!!!|`|tx8iEBgAaa	yeast or you are just ovulating... if you are ovulating there will be no smell, if its yeast there is usually itchiness and a smell|`|hHspKqfFaa	Maybe it is a yeast infection, but you should really see your doctor...|`|dpgXzMenaa	Two things will make you wet "down there"... both are normal and healthy, they both have a scent, and they're *supposed* to happen.<br>  <br>  1) Your genitals keep themselves clean and healthy by sort of "rinsing" themselves with the fluids that they make (this will happen constantly beginning in early puberty, 24/7 for the rest of your life, but you won't always notice it)... sometimes there's quite a bit of fluid and it can leak out a *lot*, so wearing panty liners or even light pads can be a good thing to help keep your clothes clean.<br>  <br>  2) When your body is aroused sexually ("turned on" or "horny", even if you're not doing or thinking anything sexual) your genitals will get wetter and slipperier... sometimes very, *very* wet... so that a penis can slide in there comfortably if you have sex like it's telling you it wants (you don't have to, of course).<br>  <br>  I'm a cook, so the only things I can really compare the healthy scent of a vagina/vulva to are foods and such... and the nearest I can think of is a fairly mild combination of fresh oysters and grated truffles (the savory mushrooms, not the sweet chocolates) - musky and usually more on the sea-like side, but not "fishy" and certainly not unpleasant.<br>  <br>  It often smells stronger when you're sexually aroused or when you're sweaty after exercise or have spent most of a day in tight pants or clinging underwear, but not always... and it tastes much like it smells, but it's a little bit salty and less sweet than the scent suggests. (Don't be afraid to taste: it can give you info that your eyes and nose - even your *doctor* - can't provide you with, in addition to the fact that it's probable your boyfriend(s) and/or husband(s) are gonna do that anyhow if they have any brains... and it's sure not gonna hurt *them*.)<br>  <br>  If this "discharge" is clear or slightly milky (might be tinted faintly yellow or brown), slippery to maybe a little sticky or stretchy, and smells "earthy, animal and a little like the ocean", it's almost certainly healthy and good. If it smells truly fishy or otherwise bad, especially if it itches or feels irritated, then it's probably an infection and you should see a doc.

I3wY7wD9aa	You need to consult a doctor. Where your back is involved - you never take any chances. When you do return to exercising it would be best to go at it gradually at first so you don't re injure your back.|`|iAABwDvAaa	Wait for it to heal up a bit, dont risk hurting your back again, its not worth it, even if you look heroic doing it.
UZJ7wVc8aa	Everyone has a problem spot. It can be around the stomach, thighs, arms or chest. No matter where your trouble spot is, the solution is exactly the same. You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs.

I am kind of the same way, I am 16 yrs old, 5'1 and 76 lbs. I lost about 10 lbs in three months from eating only 1000 calories or less and working out for 40 min a day. Sometimes i feel weak, esp when i havent eaten. I only take small amounts of food, or throw it out. I am constantly cold and sometimes tired. My doctor is concerned, but says she wont officially say im anorexic. But im still sure i have an ED.|`|1cDo3REBaa	anorexia is a mental thing not so much physical, the physical is just effects of the mental|`|b9cKQzVFaa	It sounds like, if you're not careful, you'll be well on your way to anorexia... do you move food around on your plate because you're honestly not hungry? Or because you really don't want to eat, and you just don't want anyone to notice? You might want to consider visiting a doctor if you really find yourself feeling weak tired and shivering all the time... Whatever your eating habits are right now, they don't sound completely healthy.
9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, it is possible that you could have torn one of the muscles in that area (an example only).<br>  <br>  However, the only way to know for sure what is going on is to see your doctor for further evaluation of the situation.
AA10358331	Trojan is the best brand, there are many different kinds. I would stick to the basic condom. Make sure that both of you know how to properly put one on. Check it for holes and simply roll down the penis. <br>  <br>  It hurts for the first few thrusts, he's going to be stretching you out and it kinda hurts. The pain goes away after about half a dozen trusts. (But the pleasure it worth the initiation pain). it will hurt the first few times you have sex. You will probably bleed too, because he's breaking your hymen. Its not much but you'll notice it on the toilet paper. <br>  <br>  How can you let him know: Be really touchy feely, kiss his neck or just tell him :)<br>  <br>  Hints.. Make sure you are really turned on. If you want to orgasm while having sex you need to be almost at the point of orgasm during foreplay. Tell him to go slow, because its going to be painful the first time. Use a water-based lube (oil can ruin a condom) <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|6qsocyK3aa	Any condom if fine for first timers. Just make sure the packaging is in tact and it is not past its use-by date. Don't open it with your teeth or sharp nails as that can tear it. Make sure you have more than one as it might take a few goes to get it right, especially if you've never done it before. Look up instructions on the web beforehand so you know how exactly to put one on. <br>  <br>  The main reason why sex hurts for girls is usually because the hymen breaks. The hymen is a little piece of skin that is over the entrance of the vagina. But if you use tampons or even bike-ride/horse-ride, there is a chance it could have broken anyway. Other causes of pain include being tense so make sure you are nice and relaxed. Also, make sure you're, for want of a better word, "wet". Vaginas are self-lubricating but if you need a help, you can buy lubes from shops or from online. Just make sure they're water-based, not oil-based, as oil-based lube can break down the latex of a condom.<br>  <br>  As for letting your boyfriend know you're ready, just use your instincts. A cuddle can lead to sex. Or you could just tell him you're ready.|`|a3bq277Gaa	I would recommend Trojan. Those are really good and if you rip open the box, it shows a step by step thing that will show you how to put the condom on and take it off.<br>  <br>  It doesn't hurt the guy. It will hurt you though. You will bleed. Some bleed alot, some don't bleed much.<br>  <br>  He has to be ready also. If both of you think you're ready, then just take it kind've slow. <br>  Start kissing him and then maybe whisper in his ear that you're ready and if he's ready also, then it'll go from there.<br>  <br>  You don't have to rush sex. :)|`|8nEwLmCjaa	You can use extra-safe condoms which are slightly thicker if you don't want to worry about it splitting. But do be careful about sharp nails and things. Make sure you do use a condom! :) It hurts a fair amount, but if you're truly comfortable with it, you won't be too tense and it'll be easier. + to let your boyf know that you're ready, kiss him and just let your hands wander and then whisper to him ;) <br>  Good website!
F89MNQheaa	It could be cystitis so I would try medication for that and also a sever case of thrush aswell.

Keep a diary of your symptoms until then so that you don't forget anything.Also, make sure you really push water for the next few days to flush what you can out of your system<br>  <br>  I also think you need to ask about bladder cancer.

b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	First, if you already have heavy periods, you don't want an IUD, because I had one for years and had heavy, painful periods.  <br>  <br>  You need to start taking your pills today while you are still on your period, so that you pretty much know you have not ovulated this month.  If you plan to take them for a couple of years, it might take about six months to become regular again when you quit, but that would not necessarily mean you aren't ovulating during that time, just periods not regular.  I got pregnant  after having taken pills and having IUD, so you won't be not fertile.  <br>  <br>  I think you should go with the pill and try to get them from planned parenthood so that if you don't have insurance they might be free.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|ZRu2DxEqaa	Me personally i love the IUD. Its what I got when I had my daughter. As you know as being a mother things can get busy so its hard to remember to take a pill. Plus if you have heavy periods the IUD can make them lighter. It made my way lighter. It use to least for 7 days now i'm down to only 3. Its really nice lol. They can be expensive since they are a bout $300 or around there but depending on the one you get I have the one that lasts for 5 years its cheaper in the long run.

Increased hunger will make most people binge eat.   After a while, this becomes a cycle that goes out of control, hunger, binge vomit.  This can take hours a day, and a lot of planning and hiding. <br>  <br>  If possible, don't start the vomiting cycle.  Instead, see if you can convince your mother (or yourself) to eat fewer calories a day (don't go below 2000) and increase your moderate to vigorous physical exercise at least thirty minutes a day, but no more than 60 minutes a day.<br>  <br>  If you become Bulemic, eventually, your body will store fat all the time, even if you diet.

xmibEEdcaa	Well, as I guess you've just learned, you're really not supposed to take more than 1000mg in a single dose, but the daily maximum is 4000mg, and it sounds like you never even came close to that. So I think you're okay, but to be on the safe side, you might want to stay off of alcohol and other substances that give your liver a work-out for a while.  <br>  <br>  Here are the symptoms of acetaminophen-induced liver damage:<br>  <br>  "Three clinical stages (phases) of acetaminophen-induced liver injury have been described. During the first phase, that is, the initial 12 to 24 hours or so after ingestion, the patient experiences nausea and vomiting. For the next perhaps 12 to 24 hours, which is the second phase or the so-called inactive (latent) phase, the patient feels well. In the third phase, which begins about 48 to as late as 72 hours after the ingestion of acetaminophen, liver blood test abnormalities begin to appear. Most notably, extremely high (abnormal) levels of the liver blood tests, AST and ALT, are common with this type of liver injury."<br>  <br>  So if you didn't feel at all sick after you took the percocets, and if you've not noticed anything since then that suggests to you that your liver or kidneys are not working properly, then I'd say you didn't do any acute damage.  If you're really worried about more subtle, long-term damage, then I guess you could ask your doctor for a blood work-up, but I suspect that you'll be fine.|`|uR2oKwboaa	I  weigh the same as you, it is perfectly fine, i've taken up to 3000 miligrams of acetaminophen, no harm, all it'll do is give you pain relieve, and make you happy for a while, unless you've gained a tolerance which happens quite often, for me to reach the desired effects i have to take 50 miligrams of hydrocodone:(  which is ALOT! tollerance builds fast with opiates. chill and relax, you can always extract the acetaminophen as well, if your tolerance gets too high, it's pretty easy i do it all the time. by the way i wouldn't reccoment taking 3000 miligrams of acetaminophen that often....|`|bssOhC9jaa	I think you are fine.

kmOx8Hu6aa	Doctors sometimes do miss something, and its really important that if you think something else is going on, please DONT give up until you find out what the problem is.<br>  <br>  One thing that comes to mind is Irritable Bowel Syndrome- <br>  <br>  You are believed to have IBS if abdominal pain or discomfort is continuous or comes and goes for a total of at least 12 weeks during the past year, and two of the three following conditions occur:4<br>  <br>  Pain is relieved by having a bowel movement. <br>  The frequency of bowel movements changes. <br>  The stools' appearance or form changes. <br>  The presence of any of the following symptoms supports a diagnosis of IBS. The severity of your symptoms will indicate the classification of your IBS.<br>  <br>  Bowel movement patterns<br>  In IBS, your pattern of bowel movements varies at least 25% of the time. Two or more of the following may happen:5<br>  <br>  Bowel movements may occur either more often (diarrhea) or less often (constipation) than usual, such as having more than 3 bowel movements a day or less than 3 per week. <br>  Bowel movements may differ in size or consistency (may be hard and pelletlike, pencil-thin, or loose and watery). <br>  The way stools pass changes. You may strain, feel an urgent need to have a bowel movement, or feel that you haven't completely passed a stool. <br>  You may have bloating or a feeling of gas in the intestines. <br>  Other intestinal symptoms<br>  Some people may have lower abdominal pain with constipation that is sometimes followed by diarrhea. Other people have pain and mild constipation but no diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Symptoms that are sometimes present include intestinal gas and passage of mucus in stools.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Notice though that vomitting isnt included in this so Im hesitant to encourage this diagnosis.<br>  <br>  Another thing could be a food allergy or sensitivity. <br>  <br>  It could be something wrong with his digestive tract.... there could be many things going on, but the fact that he was constipated for so long, and is now suffering from diarrhea, is significant. <br>  <br>  I really hope you keep pursuing this, even if you push your doctor to see a specialist (thats what I would recommend)<br>  <br>  Good Luck, I hope your son gets some relief!
U2tx9gDHaa	It may be a stomach problem if your hygene is what it should be ,.See your doctor.|`|BdlGBdE5aa	The major cause of bad breath is the top of the tongue where bacteria grow and produce those bad smells.

dea79d8399c75c364f69484dfc56e531aa	no....Alcoholic hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver. Up to 35 percent of heavy drinkers develop alcoholic hepatitis. Symptoms may include loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain and tenderness, fever and jaundice. In its mild form, alcoholic hepatitis can last for years and will cause progressive liver damage. The damage may be reversible if you stop drinking. In its severe form, the disease may occur suddenly, after binge drinking, and it can quickly lead to life-threatening complications.|`|inST4SlAaa	In the past, viral hepatitis had a well-deserved reputation for being contagious. Contaminated water and poor sanitation provided easy transmission for these viruses. Today, much is known about how the viruses are transmitted so that prevention is usually possible. <br>  <br>  However, infection still can occur through contaminated water or poor sanitation. In addition, during the acute phase, all body secretions -- saliva, tears, semen, urine, and especially blood -- are infectious. Sexual contact with someone who is infected is known to spread the virus. Also, if a patient is a carrier in the chronic phase, the infection may be spread through sexual contact. Intravenous drug users who share needles are at an extremely high risk of contracting hepatitis, as are people who have multiple sexual partners. Because each hepatitis virus is different, it is always best to discuss this with a physician.|`|JEYQJHuTaa	No. It's caused by the effects of alcohol on the liver. Not like Hepatitis-A or B, which you can catch.<br>  But if you look at it in another way: alcoholism has a genetic component. So if someone's parent develops alcohol-induced hepatitis, their child does have a higher than normal chance of developing it someday as well-- it shows that the parent is likely addicted to alcohol, and may have passed the additive gene on to their child.

Straving diets are just a fad and we all put the weight back on as our body craves the fats and sugars. If you need  boost try that acai berry that everyone raves about. It worked really well for me and the one from <a href="http://freeacai.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://freeacai.notlong.com</a> is the real stuff, not a fake.

7TdG2vTCaa	The best thing your GP can do for you is to make sure that your depression is not caused by anything physical, so they should examine you first.  Often times, things like your thyroid being over or under active, or hormone problems, etc. could be the cause of depression.  If they don't find a physical cause, then they will refer you to a therapist or psychiatrist.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about what to say, just say that you have been feeling depressed for a long time, and you need to do something about it.  Don't worry that they'll think poorly of you either because they see it all the time.  Especially in this day and age!<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do for yourself is to do something to make yourself feel better, so good luck|`|QGyasdZMaa	She will listen to you, then ask some questions about how long you've felt like you do and how strong your feelings are, maybe more questions.  After that it depends on the GP.  Mine gave me a sort of questionaire to measure my depression level and some tablets which helped me get out of it.  There wouldn't be any need for a physical examination unless you were obviously seriously underweight or something.|`|xnZi0i8saa	They will ask some questions and do a full physical to rule out anything physical (like a thyroid deficiency). If they believe that you are depressed they will either prescribe antidepressants or refer you to a psychiatrist for counseling and/or medication.|`|CLcGxHpAaa	She may evaluate you and prescribe antibiotics or she may refer you to a psychiatrist.  I would suggest psychiatrist, after all that is their specialty.|`|e9jXrqfdaa	It's very understandable that you feel nervous, but give yourself a pat on the back because  you know that you need to get this problem sorted out and that's good that you want to get help. Don't worry the doctor will be very used to people coming in who are nervous and don't quite know the best way to describe what the problem is especially if it's a depression related problem, Just tell the doctor honestly , you can say doctor I've not been coping very well and  I've been feeling really sad for a long time and I've come to ask for some help. The doctor will listen and ask you some questions like how long you've had these feelings have you been taking any medication how are you sleeping etc.,It is best to try and be honest about your symptoms  they will probably give you a short physical examination (don't worry you'll not have to undress to any extent) the doctor might then decide that it is best that you try an anti depressant medication or maybe some thing to help you sleep better. Remember there is no shame in seeking advice, you'd go without hesitation if you had broken your leg wouldn't you?  As for any further assistance from a psychiatrist or a counsellor that will depend on your doctor, usually the first thing he or she will do is prescribe an anti depressant and they take about 14 to 21 days to get absorbed into your system and then you start to feel better. Good luck your on your way to feeling better.|`|szjZFiPdaa	Believe me, your GP will have seen hundreds of people like you and helped them so if you feel you need help, go get it. You'll most likely be asked a few basic questions about why you feel the way you do and to what extent but nothing too in depth. If anything, you'll be prescribed a mild form of antidepressant and if you feel you want it, you may be referred to some form of counselling.<br>  <br>  Be aware though that if you live in the UK, you may have to wait some time to get an appointment with a counsellor but it depends on where you are. I'm not ashamed to admit that I needed to reach out a while back and was prescribed anti-depressants and they worked quite well, although after a while I didn't feel like my moods were my own and decided to wean myself off them. I also had some diamond friends that were very supportive.<br>  <br>  Most important thing: don't try and deal with it yourself, ask for help and keep positive. Don't see depression as embarrassing, rather a point in your life where you can go further up than down. If you see it that way, the sky's the limit!!!<br>  <br>  Damo.|`|jh0iGkdeaa	She will probably ask about your behaviour and how long you have been feeling like this and ask if you know what could of made you depressed, its highly unlikely she will give you an examination, unless its your appearance that is making you depressed, or you know of nothing what so ever that could of made you depressed, in which case she will check you eyes and give you a test (asking you the date, your birthday, address, responsiveness e.c.t) to check for possible brain damage or a mini stroke which may of made you depressed without knowing it or check the body are concerned.<br>  <br>  All you need to tell her is that you have been feeling depressed for quite some time and its really affecting your life, and she will probably start asking questions at that point and you answer honestly and she will help you. No matter how stupid or trivial it seems, tell her and she will be able to help you.|`|ad546eb4ad008896efd06eee52847433aa	Depression is a more common problem than you think so you will probably get a sympathetic ear and the proper treatment|`|6dQzmsXuaa	GP will do check up and suggest medicine.|`|ouzrDPaSaa	Your GP probably wouldnt give you any physical examination apart from maybe weighing and measuring you.<br>  <br>  I've suffered from depression since I was a child but only went to my doctors about it last year.  When I did I wished I'd gone sooner, it was nothing to worry about.<br>  <br>  If it helps you write down some of the key points you want to say on a piece of paper.  You're doctor will guide you through the rest of the appointment, and ask you questions to help him/her determine the severity of your depression.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may feel that they can treat your depression alone, or they may refer you to your local community mental health team or to a talking therapy like counselling or CBT.  Its impossible to predict.<br>  <br>  Hope things improve for you.|`|ayGeAonbaa	You've taken the first step by acknowledging that you have a problem so well done for that. Your GP will ask you some questions about how you are feeling and some medical questions to determine what is wrong. You may be given a mood questionnaire to take away and complete to complete - this is nothing to worry about and it will help your GP to diagnose you. He/She may prescribe medication and refer you to a psychiatrist or other therapist. There will be a waiting list for this so don't be disheartened if you're not seen immediately.
paerqxfMaa	Explain to your folks how important this is to you and how it makes you feel.  Maybe they'll come up with some money - try to go to a dentist with a sliding scale fee schedule - a rural health network dentist or look to see if there is a dental school in your area.  You can probably get the work done cheaper - not to worry, their teachers are there to supervise them.  Maybe if you offer to get a job that can help pay towards it - if your folks see how important it is to you, maybe they'll do what they can to help you out.<br>  You can also try going to a counselor and explain to them how horrible your teeth effect your life experience and maybe they can refer to a dentist that would allow it to be paid off or would do it a very low cost.  <br>  But if you really want assistance, you have to ask for it - let them know how it makes you feel.|`|gLek6XTuaa	braces are free if your in education!! just go to the outhadontist!

BG8vMyZjaa	From the site shown below.  there is a lot of information on that site.<br>  <br>  Yes it can. some causes - u rine infection, alcohol, coffee or diuretic medicines, diabetes, stress and anxiety/<br>  Wetting the bed at night (the medical term is enuresis) is more common in adults than you might think. It affects about one person in every hundred, mainly men. More than 100 000 teenagers in the UK wet the bed – some only occasionally, while others may never have experienced a dry night. Many feel so embarrassed that they hide it from their families and can find it a barrier to forming close relationships. It can be especially difficult when staying away from home. If you also have difficulty holding your urine during the day, look at the section on urinary incontinence.<br>  Do not blame yourself. Remind yourself that it is not your fault. There is no need to feel guilty or dirty. And remember that no one can tell just by looking at you that you have this problem.|`|bxlYleZkaa	Yes it can! It is psychological rather than physical and you need counselling rather than pills!|`|45a8c885a9b24a213fe52c9cba5e4a24aa	you could check with the 24 hour nurse hotline.

If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).
NXYJxnc0aa	Abrasives help clean.. but can be harmful over time to the enamel.. A toothpaste with fluoride is what I recommend to my patients, as it has great effects over time such as strengthening teeth and preventing cavities. If teeth are sensitive I recommend a toothpaste with potassium nitrate.. because it helps with sensitivity. Toothpaste doesn't necessarily remove plaque, it is the brushing technique and toothbrush its self that does.|`|5q0sMFSxaa	sodium lauryl sulphate<br>  the same stuff found in shampoo|`|FoEfJovgaa	My best answer for you is to buy tubes of toothpastes and look at the common ingredient (the most used ingredient will be listed first->last) than search that specific ingredient.|`|wOecmtrzaa	The basic most nessesary ingreedient of toothpaste is diatomacious earth.  This is dirt.  Dirt that small algal organisms died in and left their skeletons in.  These skeletons are EXELENT at polishing teeth.

Obviously they sterilize this stuff and clean it out before they put it in the tube.<br>  <br>  The ingredient that makes toothpaste foam up is SLS.  Sodium Laueth Sulfate (Im not sure on the spelling of the second word, though!).

dSgX1Rbraa	I am so incredibly sorry about your miscarriage. I can't even comprehend the emotional pain you must be going through. It is common to have spotting and some clotting when you first take birth control pills, especially after your body has gone through such a terrible physical trauma. The cramping and excess blood could also be related to the stress you are having as a result of this incident. It is important to keep taking your birth control pills, as they will regulate your hormone levels. If this happens with your next few periods, I would consult your doctor again. In the meantime, try to relax and take some pain medication. Exercise also will help you to de-stress and your body will begin to feel better. Good luck and once again, I'm deeply sorry.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|Kx9QgyjSaa	Diet & exercise really are the key.  You must consume fewer calories than you use to lose weight.  If you don't want to eat less or go to the gym more maybe some modest life style changes such as use stairs for less than 2 stories,  walk to work/school,  get off the bus/subway one exit early and walk the difference,  take up orienteering, use a bicycle to go to the post office instead of a car, cut the grass with a push mower instead of a gas mower.  talk to some one about what you are doing at the gym.  maybe you are doing mass building activities more than reduction activities.  All the folks that would sell you something that will help you lose weight are taking advantage of your distress more than actually helping you.  having said that a group like weight watchers can give moral support.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|oWTXPtxwaa	It's just that your working outt, your muscle is weighing more than fatt.<br>  Don't go by your weight, go by how you see yourself in the mirror, you can be toning out everything and looking good, but you won't go down on the scale because muscle is replacing the fatt, and it weighs alot more than fat.<br>  <br>  <br>  Example me, august, i was 125, and i had a little more stomach fat,<br>  now I am 134,, but thinner, but have more muscle,<br>  <br>  YOU get me>? don't go by the scale, go by your looks.

mAQHyfCYaa	You should be fine. See how right in the info it says use a second form such as a condom. If you used a condom you should be fine. Honestly the reason it says that is because if you throw up you can throw up the pill. If you throw up the best thing to do is to take another pill. That's why you should always have a spare backup pack of your pills.<br>  <br>  Also, if you were already pregnant (which I don't think you are) plan b wouldn't help at all. It can't terminate a pregnancy that's already implanted.<br>  <br>  But like I said, if you are using a condom as well you should be fine. I'm on the pill and me and my boyfriend never use a condom unless I am on antibiotics and I've only had one pregnancy scare and it turns out I had the flu.|`|MGXHme6Qaa	u should be okay.  if u want, just go to the pharmacy and get plan b|`|3Mr3ReLZaa	too long questions are for stupid askers with small boobs!|`|6NA2MXNPaa	Wow, those first two answers are quite rude.

dI9BLGYpaa	It depends on the dumbbells, obviously. I know women who lift 40-something pounders who are rather ripped, but I myself only lift 10 lb. ones for overall strength. You will not get bulky unless you do the special workouts for bulking up, which include very few reps with extreme weights.<br>  <br>  Benefits are increased strength and muscle, which makes you have a higher metabolism. You will be burning more fat throughout the day! No dieter should ever skip strength training!<br>  <br>  I started with 5 lb. ones and worked my way up. If you're a total beginner, try a DVD that will teach you proper moves 1st. Envy Girls has a good arm routine (even though I know the name sounds silly) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Envy-Girls-Workouts-Spots-Really/dp/B000NA78S4/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1236407436&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Envy-Girls-Workout...</a> There's also a good one on Exercise TV called "A-List Arms," if you have On Demand.<br>  <br>  My workout now is mostly my own combination that I've come up with using dumbbells, a medicine ball and bands. I've incorporated moves that I liked from prolly around 6 different arm DVD's I've tried. So experiment and see what you like. You'll have your own custom routine in no time.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, it's also good to drink either a protein shake or a glass of soy milk or something directly afterward to help with muscle recovery. It actually makes all the difference for me after cardio, too. Dymatize Elite Whey in Butter Cream Toffee is really good.|`|1oNi2v38aa	No you won't look like a pro bodybuilder lifting dumbbells, it's not that easy...|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	repititions of low weights will give definition to the muscle, low reps of heavy weights will cause the bulking up.the best thing to do is start out at a weight that isnt too light but is heavy after lifted several times. so start out with a lets say 5 pound weight lifting it 10 times on each arm. then if it gets light and you want to get definition, use that same weight for higher repetitions like 20 times instead of 10. then if you want to be stronger, go to a 10 pound weight, and go ten repetitions. then repeat steps over til at the desired strength and tone.|`|ZCCFzvMBaa	When getting toned but not bulky you want to use less weight but more reps. You also want to target all areas and muscles in your arms by doing different lifting techniques.  Some good exercises for your arms are dumbbell kickbacks 5-10 lbs 3 stets of 15 reps, bent rows, standing dumbbell laterals, seated dumbbell curls, wrist curls and extensions, and so forth using the same weight and reps 3 times a week. This will help you maintain lean muscle mass and not get bulky.  Add 20-30 minutes of some cardio to your workout as well. Hope this helps and good luck!|`|i05dLLeRaa	You will not Bulk up because you miss one key ingredient, Testosterone. <br>  <br>  Testosterone is necessary to build big bulky muscles. The benefits to working out with weights is that it will make you stronger, more tone and your body will burn more fat. <br>  <br>  The weight is something you will have to figure out.

4f2GaLhpaa	When you get a flu shot or vaccine it reduces your chances of getting the flu, and "Testing has shown that both the flu shot and the nasal-spray vaccine are effective at preventing the flu." However it has to be once a year because there are different virus strains that come around with each circulation of the virus. So if you got one last year it won't be as strong and may not be able to handle all types of the flu. <br>  <br>  Also the typical flu season if during the winter time so I'm pretty sure since you haven't already gotten it- it's not very likely that you're going to get it again. <br>  <br>  Oh and about the stomach flu question, the effectiveness of the shot depends on the age of the person and how healthy you are.... BUT the stomach flu and influenza are two totally different things. You are getting the shot to protect against influenza which is a virus not the stomach flu that's caused mostly by bacteria or food poisioning. So I think you're talking mostly about the stomach flu, which doesn't have a vaccine. <br>   <br>  && I think you're chances of getting it are really small you're a clean person with WAY better habbits than most people so don't change your habbits!! [:|`|usi4aKnHaa	the flu virus mutates every year meaning that no strand of the virus is the same. the flu shot may not even work and yes you can get sick, but it's unlikely because you are so clean. I myself haven't gotten the stomach flu in at least 5 years because I try my best to be clean and I haven't gotten a cough during cold season for like 3 years, I never get sick because I am clean, so it definitely helps.|`|FAzua6k7aa	No. You are not immune to a stomach flu, my family once had it twice. 4 weeks of throwing up! Yuck. You need to constantly wash your hands, keep your hands away from your face. Good rinsing with soap and water, to me, is better than that hand sanitizer. If I knew sickness was going around, I would use my paper towel to let myself out of the bathroom so I wouldn't have to touch the door knob and throw it away in the trash at my next destination. The stomach flu and the influenza virus are totally different. I am older and never had and never will get the flu vaccine. It's been many years since I have had the flu, I have 4 children so take that for what it's worth. Good luck and keep those hands clean and clear of your face.

UqLbDHBraa	I know this is going to seem kinda weird but, I used to work at a restaurant (a nearly dead restaurant every night so its not like I got a work out from a busy one.) At the end of the night when we cleaned up, I swept and mopped. When I swept I hunched over just the slightest bit and tightened my stomach muscles. When I mopped I did the same but also made wide swipes with the mop so that I was literally just twisting my waist. I was skinny (and still am) but I noticed that after a few weeks of this I actually started getting the faint beginnings of abs.

uZQ9GDSlaa	If you are going to eat them, please listen to this advice: even if you don't like the taste, chew them one little bite at a time very very thoroughly before you swallow, it should be watery mush before it gets into your stomach. Don't let your friends punk you out and demand that you eat the whole eighth in five minutes. They'll be barfing their guts out two hours later and you won't. Your saliva can do a lot of digesting right there in your mouth, and mushrooms are hard for a body to digest, so this will make life way easier on you. I think that mushrooms are hard on the liver. They sure screwed mine up. But I was eating them pretty often, and I drank a lot at the time too. So do dabble. And give yourself lots of time between shrooms. As for your mind, I think they are better than a lot of things you could be doing. I always found them so relaxing, and silly. But silly in a good way. I think they are better for your mind than a day on Wall Street, or any other high stress damaging activity, sincerely.|`|bBOf3YlMaa	<a href="http://allforyou.amstrad.at" rel="nofollow">http://allforyou.amstrad.at</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|Ks9FsBmzaa	Are they bad? Perhaps. Although some mushrooms are toxic enough to kill you, if you have the right kind, they will not harm you physically. You will lose your appetite, and may find yourself entering a period called "coming down" which is unpleasant. While on them, however, you will likely find the effect on your mind to be one that you have never experienced before. If not prepared, this could cause a variety of temporary changes to mood and mindset. Increased paranoia, discomfort, and an overall awkwardness may occur.<br>  <br>  These effects, however, will be mixed in with a euphoria and greater sense of self-awareness, as well as a changed awareness concerning your surroundings and life in general. It is possible to experience out of body experiences, and a general feeling of dissociation in relation to everyday life and reality.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FDissociation_(psychology)&ei=HyiySd6QBo-gM8b_jPYE&usg=AFQjCNGaOSj2XGswILxSVVBv-Jw7av_m4A&sig2=VTrjPc3k7Lcgbt_bgKVwww" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&source=web...</a>

dba6798daedd01dcb233c8a115096ed5aa	Yes. When you lift weights, you'll gain more muscle. When you have muscle, you'll feel heavier but you're still burning plenty of calories. Lift lighter weights if you're getting bulky quick. switch to resistance bands or just use your own body weight. I know a lot of people don't like to bulk up too much. Or if you're looking for that bulk, add a lil' more weight but slowly. You can gain a few pounds of muscle

ZHJuK1QNaa	Hi Lauren- Almonds are a great snack. They are loaded with healthy oils.  But, like everything else you can over do a good thing. A serving is six whole almonds. They are really energy dense, which means for their size they are loaded with fiber and healthy fats.  My son graduated with his degree in exercise science, nutrition, fitness and wellness management.  He was concerned when he looked at your diet, and understands why you are so hungry and said any one would be.  He said you are very deficient in fruits and vegetables.  He doesn't care for weight watchers point system and has worked with a lot of weight watcher participants getting them on a more balanced meal and exercise program. He would advise you to add steamed broccoli to your lunch.  And steamed carrots or any other vegetable you enjoy to your dinner.  He also suggested that you could snack on grapes, celery, cauliflower, oranges, apples etc.  Almost any vegetable other than potatoes.  Also make sure that the first ingredient listed on your bread products is 100% whole wheat.  Many products claim to be whole grain when in fact they are far from it.  After being so disappointed in the whole grain breads I could buy at the super market, I began making all our breads again.  I cannot believe how much more energy I have, and how much longer I stay satisfied. I start by grinding whole white wheat. It is higher in protein than hard red wheat it still has the nutty flavor, all the nutrients but isn't as heavy.  If you would like to know how to make bread I would be happy to email you thorough instructions.  Not knowing if that would even interest you I don't want to give you those here. Also, even though green tea can be good for you some contain tanic acid which isn't good. You need to drink a lot more fluid.   I hope you find success, however I think your over all health is far more important than a number on a scale.<br>  Good Luck, I hoped this helped some.|`|qJXSTtTfaa	Almonds are suppose to be really healthy for you.  It's said if you eat them on a regular basic it will improve your health.<br>  <br>  <br>  P.s. I had green tea and oatmeal for breakfast too!!! haha small world.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Oh yes. I suggest eating only 12 or enough that fit in the palm of your hand. Almonds are a great fat.
3VOZcHtQaa	You may want to try looking into a raw food diet.  It will give you great energy and the changes in your health are almost immediate.  If you are interested, there are two great books to read.  The Raw Food Diet Detox by Natalia Rose, and 12 Steps to Raw Food, by Victoria Boutenko.  Both will give you glowing health if you can stick to it.  The Diet Detox is easier to follow because she has easier transitions.  <br>  <br>  Try eating raw food for just one day and you will be amazed by the mental clarity that you have in just one day!  Also, you can eat really great foods like raw nuts and avocados and you don't need to worry about any points!|`|zrFzbDHUaa	WW was designed for people to be able to eat  WHATEVER they want, as long as you don't go over your points. It sounds like you are really doing great on WW, so why would you want to change what you are doing?  First, you should eat 5 small meals a day to keep your blood sugar levels and metabolism stable. This will also make it so you don't get hungry and over eat with just 3 meals. Stick to 1000-1200 calories a day. Cut out bad carbs, ie.. starches and sugar.  Eat  an omelet for breakfast, fruit  for a snack.  Tuna salad or turkey rolls with cream cheese and a few crackers for lunch. Fruit for another snack. Eat meat of any kind for dinner with a salad and some veggies. Have a desert snack after dinner. I like the 60 calorie sugar free puddings with  bananas.  Vanilla yogurt with strawberries and bananas and a few chopped almonds on top are a great tasting snack.|`|qJXSTtTfaa	yeah, process food is no good for our body but fruits and veggies are!!!  I started to eat oatmeal in the mourning's which of course helps you control hunger.  Drink green tea 3x a day.  Drinking ICE COLD water actually burns calories so drink up.  <br>  Start going to your organic food store.  Everything there is so much better for you than in regular food stores.  Buy every fruit and veggies you see. Start buying wheat things instead of whites (if you want pasta make sure it's wheat).  Eggs are great for you.  switch to low fat milk and start eating yogurt.  Nuts and berries are not just a low calorie food but it has really great benefits for your body!  When your eating salad use some sort of vinegar ( I use rice vinegar and I season it) it's way less calories than ranch. Start eating fish and chicken.

My moms has lost 33 lbs in the last 4+ months with minimal exercise. She was recommended to go to trader joe's because there is little to no hormones injected into their meat which bulks the animals up which then passes on to you. She has doubled or tripled the amount of food she is eating which has sped up her metabolism and she stopped eating carbs after 2pm. She eats smaller healthier meals 4-6 times a day versus 2-3 big meals which takes longer to metabolize. I recommend as much cardio as possible. What you have listed looks fine but the workouts are similar. It would be nice if you could add in some other routines to keep your body guessing. Swimming is the best but there may not be alot of places easily excessable. Bottom line is you can do it.

I weight 200 pounds back then and I was not attractive at all in High School. So I went to the park everyday for 6 hours a day in the summer time for 2 months (july&august). I ate 90% vegetable and fruits in my meals, only a tiny bit of meat during those 2 months. Guess what, I lost 50 pounds total. <br>  <br>  However, my blood test showed I have very low on iron and proteins so I have to take 9 months pills in order to regain my healthy life cycle.<br>  It was a great experience for me but I have to suffer the consequences.<br>  <br>  What I am saying to prove is that not to take shortcuts or anything.

I took an ibuprofen before i went in and the actual insertion didn't hurt to bad.<br>  <br>  Driving home I started to get cramping, then had cramping for a few hours.<br>  <br>  After that I have not felt it at all!<br>  <br>  Its not hormonal so it doesn't effect your weight, sex drive or moods. that is why I got it.<br>  <br>  The only thing I have noticed is that a few days before my period I will get cramps and have light spotting.|`|afJz77pjaa	I've got Paraguard and I love it. The first month or so is dreadful, but once you tough it out, it's really convenient. But I'm sure with Mirena, you know what I'm talking about. <br>  <br>  Since Paraguard is non-hormonal, it won't cause any weight gain or cause your period to stop. And no sex drive changes. It really doesn't affect my body in anyway. I get fat on my own! :D
cG8dpzWJaa	I would get checked out by your doctor to make sure you are okay.  I would still eat something or at least take a multi-vitamin to make sure you get all your nutrients, but definitely get checked out!<br>  <br>  Hope everything is okay|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Hmm...so you haven't had ANYTHING to eat at all? Are you drinking water?|`|4vO41XV5aa	when i couldnt eat for a week because i had mouth ulcers i was so relieved when they went away. i was like yes i can eat so much now. but i found out when i tried to eat i got full very easily and things i would usually eats heaps of.<br>  i asked my mum what was wrong with me<br>  she said because i hadn't eaten in so long my actual stomach had shrunk meaning i didnt have to eat as much to get full. but i ate as much as i could because i got sick of being full and i am now back to what i usually eat<br>  <br>  that might have happened to you|`|JITTMjasaa	Drink water and talk to a doctor. You could have a disorder that would make you require appetite enhancers...Dr. Green Thumb :)|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	Do you want to eat?<br>  <br>  Suck on some ginger root from the grocery store produce aisle.<br>  Smoke a little weed.|`|STLYxP39aa	Maybe just a loss of appetite. If you're feeling sick, see a doctor.<br>  You should eat anyways though|`|PIVKGi2Eaa	the weed thing from above  ^<br>                                          I<br>  heard gets u hungry haven't tried my self
Ve6RAuq3aa	do not skip meals ever...<br>  <br>  this causes metabolic problems, meaning that your body stores as much fat as it possibly can to try and get through those periods when u dont eat, like camels having stores of water, but you will end up with stores of fat.<br>  <br>  if u are trying to lose weight, u need to find a high protein, low carb diet plan, this is by far the best type of diet.<br>  <br>  just do not ever skip meals|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Skipping ANY meal is not going to help you lose any weight. It makes you gain weight because the body stores fat, thinking it won't be eating for awhile.<br>   It's best to eat every single meal in small portions and exercise.|`|spXPpyP0aa	skip breakfeast not lunch|`|AA10736671	no way never skip ur meal. instead see ur portion. take food in small portions. some tips to loose weight are<br>  <br>  1) The very first thing u should keep in your mind and that is the extra weight u put on didn’t come in overnight so it is not possible and also unrealistic to take it off quickly. You have to show patience. Please remember learning to eat well and exercise is the only solution to long-term weight loss.<br>  2) The 2nd important thing is that your body weight is controlled by the number of calories you eat and the number of calories you use each day. So, if you consume fewer calories than you burn, you will lose weight. You can do this by becoming more physically active or by eating less. <br>  3) The 3rd important thing is never skip ur meal or go to a crash diet. Don’t ever try to starve urself. It is very important to understand that when you skip a meal or go on a crash diet, the result is that it slows your metabolism to conserve your energy. And when you lose weight too quickly for a few days, your body thinks it is threatened with starvation and goes into survival mode. It fights to conserve your fat stores. There fore keep in mind never try to skip ur meal, especially breakfast and always try to take food on time <br>  4) Before starting any type of diet, weight yourself and note ur whole body measurement in a dairy. Then after every week weigh your self again and compare with earlier measurements and see how much weight u r losing. Record a goal that you can reach in one month that is 4 to 8 pounds less than you weigh now. Set a goal you know you can achieve.<br>  Now some tips how to set ur diet plan.<br>  5) Start taking your food with out any oil. Try to use boiled/steamed vegetables, meat, and lot of salad. U can eat fresh and raw fruits, boiled/steamed chicken or red meat too but no pork. Please note and put it in ur mind that nothing fried or oily.<br>  6) No Junk Food, Potato & Sugar Please. <br>  7) Drink at least 3 ltr of water daily. Make ur habit to drink water as much as u can. In this way you are not only flushing out toxins, you are also teaching your body that it no longer needs to store water. When you feel starving, drink it as much as u can. Pls remember water is a natural appetite suppressant. <br>  8) Make you habit to use brown bread & sugar. Skimmed or low fat milk & yogurt.<br>  9) First try to avoid any type of soft drink but if u want to taste some thing sweet then drink any soft drink (remember use regular one, no diet cola pls) once in a week<br>  10) Make ur habit to eat once a day a vegetable soap or Thai soup (as ur dinner or lunch) But remember no corn flour in it. <br>  11) Just look at your food portion. It is much better to eat several small meals a day (like 5-6 healthy meals a day) than eat either one or two or three huge meal a day. <br>  12) The most important factor in any weight loss plan is how many calories you consume each day, and eating too few is the most common mistake. Divide ur diet into 5-6 healthy meals a day (1 plate size only)<br>  13) One bowl of oatmeal can be taken as a break fast<br>  14) Smoking & any kind of hard drink is not allowed in this diet.<br>  15) Try to chew ur every food as much as u can, and then swallow it into ur stomach.<br>  16) Watch out ur every drink and every single piece of ur food. Stay away from fatty foods, junk foods, synthetic foods, foods with preservatives and too much carbohydrate. Don’t try to take foods that are made of white flour for example white bread, cakes, pasta etc and food contain sugar such as cookies, ice cream, candy etc.<br>  17) Remember after every 15 days you can take once in a while with a little treat any thing u like. But remember just a small portion. For example one small personal pizza or one small burger or small pastry.<br>  18) Try to adopt some healthy timing. Early to rise and early to bed. No late sittings. <br>  19) People usually want Quick and Easy result, we are all impatient. U have to be patient in terms of ur weight loss and never give up. Always keep in mind that slow and steady win the race.<br>  20) At least take this diet for 3 to 6 months. When u feel that u have achieved ur desired weight then make this is as a Life Style change for ur entire life. Remember do not focus on just losing weight; try to concentrate on diet plan forever so that u will never have to loose weight again. Occasionally u can take junk food too.<br>  21) You have to keep in mind that above plan is a not a quick thin program. Don’t try to deceive ur body. It will destroy your metabolism and in the future the proportion of gaining weight is much higher and easier than today.<br>  22) Exercise: Rule-of -Thumb: remember the formula for weight loss and that is Diet= 70% Exercise= 30%. So remember exercise is must with every diet plan.. The best indoor exercise machine is tread mill. Run daily on tread mill for 30 mnts ~ one hour as per ur convenient. If you don’t have Tread Mill then best indoor exercise is skipping.|`|i05dLLeRaa	No. Missing meals will actually make your body store fat. If you do not eat enough your body goes into starvation mode. It will slow down its metabolism and store as much fat as possible. <br>  <br>  You should eat several small meals a day. That will actually increase your metabolism.
249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|ZYOJQdjyaa	Find a way to replace the activity - you aren't very big to begin with.|`|ALUI34Qsaa	I had too many inches in all the embarrassing zones until I tried out acai berry, I know they say that pills do not work, nevertheless they definitely worked for me, and they have been featured on CBS News too.

o9p5kn1Baa	ugh i have the same problem, ever since i was little i've grown up with awful ear infections, and constant drainage, i have to clean about 2-3 times a day, i ended up going to doctor and he had a peek in my ears and said "yucky." lol i thought that was rather rude, but he ended up performing a mini surgery on them, and pulling out polyps that were built up in there, behind my eardrum. he stuffed some cotton in my ears, gave me some drops, and said to avoid getting water in them for a couple weeks. i was amazed at the difference! for the first time in my life, when i put in a Q-tip, nothing was on it! unfortunately, a month later, the wax came back. but you might have this same problem. good luck!|`|wpsAuIuRaa	have the elves clean it out and then douche in it<br>  BUT YOU DO NOT DOUCHE EVER<br>  EVVVVVVER|`|Bu0TSiaKaa	use an ear wax removal kit.  or you could schedule an appointment with your doctor to have the ear wax taken out.|`|spXPpyP0aa	Use a q-tip
2jMFurDoaa	he is still hurt that you broke up with him.<br>  <br>  did you actually say "we're breaking up" or did you just stop talking to him?<br>  <br>  if you just stopped talking to him he was probably very confused, you went away for 6 weeks and then just called him out of the blue to hang out. <br>  <br>  that email was probably his closure.|`|mzMOpQhvaa	What you did was wrong.<br>  He got no answers, and I can only assume was very upset.<br>  <br>  Read the email and take it for what its worth. Next time, put yourself in the other person's shoes. He deserves as apology I assume.|`|rHHm4XNpaa	he is saying, he should be the one dumping you.|`|ULkqriEhaa	Maybe he is upset because of the way you ended the relationship. The best way to end things is to talk about your feelings openly and explain why the relationship needs to end, ignoring someone only makes them hurt and angry with you and the situation.<br>  <br>  He's probably doing this as a defence mechanism to show you he's "over it" but he is probably just very hurt and is trying to make you feel the pain he feels (not saying this is a good thing) <br>  <br>  I would simply explain to him (in person, not email) why you ended it, and depending on why you broke up, apologize for ignoring him but say you why you broke it off. Or maybe why you gave him the silent treatment<br>  <br>  Mention too that you do not appreciate these e-mails because they won't change anything and they are hurtful. If this doesn't clear things up, just move on. Don't email him back nasty stuff too, you'll sink to his level and a big chain of bad events will come from it. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|DT4PHmukaa	I know the silent treatment seems like the easy way out but any relationship when over needs to be officially ended,maybe with a note, phone call,etc. If you feel it is difficult for you to tell him face-to-face that is okay and it is normal. If it is a violent relationship then you ended it the best way you knew how.
ICHzrALJaa	When women have sexy dreams and become excited, it's common for their heart rate and blood pressure to hike up, their nipples to get hard, and their breasts to enlarge. Blood flow increases to the genitals so that the clitoris swells and the vagina lubricates itself, producing wetness. This can happen when women are awake — and while they're asleep! There is less evidence of wet dreams in women than in men because less liquid is produced or spilled on the bed sheets.<br>  <br>  I found a "guide" on how to have more of those dreams lol<br>  <br>  "1. Resist the urge to masturbate for several days - if you are excited, caress yourself while watching some pornographic videos. If you feel like your about to experience and Orgasm, stop masturbation immediately. <br>  <br>  2. Choose a night that you will be able to sleep privately, comfortably and without interruption. Ensure you will not be cold in the night. <br>  <br>  3. Pick a short pornograhic video with only intercourse and watch it while masturbating until you fall asleep. Set the video in a loop with the sound a bit louder than usual. Again, do not orgasm.<br>  <br>  4. Helpful things include sleeping in the nude, and sleeping with a firm pillow between your legs. "<br>  <br>  I hope this answers your question.|`|6NXJNOjJaa	ive experienced that as well!! it was pretty good :) i don't know how to get those kinds of dreams again unfortunately.  it pretty much just woke me up and i remember wondering if it was really just in my dream or if it actually happened.  after a couple times i realized that they were real. i dont really know much more about them however. but you are not alone!|`|wpsAuIuRaa	i had one once<br>  it was nice and my dinosaurs loved it<br>  and the elfs were thoroughly enjoying it and throwing a spring bash in my toesies while i danced merrily in happy unicorn land while orgasming<br>  that was my experience<br>  ps do not douche|`|AA11840819	Yes women have orgasms in their sleep also.

I have never liked those charts that give you your ideal body weight. They are never correct. <br>  <br>  It is much better to go by your body fat percentage and just what you look like. Muscle weighs more than fat so you could be in better shape as well as look better at a heavier weight. <br>  <br>  I am a man so it is a little different, but if you went by the charts for my ideal weigh, I would be obese. I am anything but. It does not take into account for muscle mass.

spbqfjvbaa	Yes.  Sometimes women do it because they don't want pantylines & don't like dealing with a G-String or thong.  Sometimes they do it so their spouse/gf/bf have easy access to the "goodies" when their out & about.<br>  <br>  Or, they may not have clean underwear & just go without.  As far as her period, I'd say at least 90% of  women will wear underwear during that time.<br>  <br>  I've done it.  My wife's done it.  Sometimes it's just for the hell of it, or we're just running out to the store for something quick.  Or, lounging around the house, I go sans chonies.

When i first started mine mine came every 2 weeks too. Mine lasted 9 days so i only got like 5 days break. I was already anemic before i got my period but it made me feel more faint.

rpnFxnCQaa	I can relate to how you feel. I used to suffer from anxiety/agoraphobia. <br>  Here is what happened to me and what worked for me eventually. <br>  <br>  I was thinking too much. I had anxiety attacks when I had to speak in public. Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. Looking back, I feel I should have taken action way earlier. But anyway, that's the past.<br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of the side effects. That's when I discovered a program that cured me. It is a 100% natural method. You can find it here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.stop-your-anxiety-now.com</a><br>  <br>  The key of that technique is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety. You know what I mean? You are thinking too much. You have to get out of that loop. <br>  Tackle the issue ASAP. You can get rid of it - others have, I have.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ULkqriEhaa	Hmm, well i am sorry to hear about your parents attitudes towards this. First, i would suggest getting your doctor to talk to your parents and explain to them that it's not all in your head.<br>  <br>  Medications are usually effective in treating these attacks, it's unfair that you have to go off something that helps you. (Come to canada! great healthcare here) <br>  <br>  but, on a serious note, try holistic treatments if you like, yoga is great for anxiety...but really, all i can suggest is trying to get your parents on your side with this one. If they don't want to help pay for your medications, perhaps another family member can?<br>  <br>  Take Care.|`|yUoa678Gaa	exercise for sure. Sunlight is also beneficial, why I don't know. Meditation helps, and getting an education on anxiety is always a good thing. Learning why you are getting these attacks goes along way to curing the problem.<br>  <br>  Xanax i a very good med for treating anxiety but it is highly addicting and can cause some extremely bad side effects if you're not weaned from them correctly. I would suggest you avoid this drug unless you are guaranteed access to it for as long as you need it. It can really be hell to stop taking it cold turkey.|`|spXPpyP0aa	Hmm try asking your doctor. Maybe abilify|`|TLbzXMhhaa	Do not take xanex, it is very very addictive. I have had really bad anxiety for a good two years now (came out of the blue). I do not take anything, because i don't wanna depend on something to make me feel normal. It sucks. This may sound stupid, but i always keep gum or candy with me, or even a bottle of water. I feel like whenever i feel like one coming on i chew gum (it sort of keeps ur mind occupied). The main thing you need to know, is YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY. You need to say that your self. Nothing is going to happen to you. Keep your self moving, if you are standing in one place..i feel like it gets worse. If you want to go see a doctor, you can. You do not need your parents permission for that. No one understands what anxiety is like until you experience it, so they have NO clue. Good luck I hope you feel better. Try not to rely on drugs, they only make you feel worse.|`|uLlwcUbsaa	A good diet and exercises helps anxiety .|`|ParFJxnSaa	A previous answer follows, with some other treatments, like acupressure (E.F.T.), relaxation methods, and hypnotherapy. View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first - main anxiety post] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.
krgtMHx7aa	Yes there is an "abortion pill".  It is called ru486.  It must be given under a doctor's supervision.

Getting pregnant or the thought of getting pregnant while on the medications I am on to keep me from having seizures is not ok. Any girl with epilepsy who is having sex at all should be talking to a doctor. For some sex can trigger things, as well as anxiety and so on. I don't know what kind of epilepsy your girlfriend has and what causes episodes for her - but, it might be better for you to play it safe. She should be seeing a doctor for that anyway. Mixing pills with medications for epilepsy WITHOUT the consultation of a doctor is not a good idea. <br>  <br>  Also, there is no abortion pill.... You should know that kind of stuff if your having sex - especially unprotected. There are morning after pills, but, even those should be consulted on before mixing them with medications and or taking them at all. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

yDJiiqcsaa	"Squirting" is a phenomenon created by the porn industry. Take an anatomy class and you'll see that there is no organ that can make a woman "ejaculate". Squirting is peeing during excitement/orgasm.  A vagina can spasm and if it had a copious amount of mucus you might get a smidgen to be expelled but not more than a spoonful.  Any more than that - it's pee.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	1 in every 22 woman can squirt....odds are against you,she will more than likely have a orgasm without squirting.|`|AA12307022	Women can have orgasms without squirting- the majority of women's orgasms happen without squirting, but some orgasms (generally a g-spot orgasm) can cause some women to ejaculate (which is not the same as urine), If she squirts *without* an orgasm, it is likely that she is unintentionally urinating. <br>  Basically- girls can orgasm without ejaculating, but cannot ejaculate without orgasm.|`|gC98RlU3aa	yes, i've never squirted but i kno i've orgasmed. there are diff positions to "trigger" diff receptors in ur body|`|nF0Eaa2Gaa	Some say they can squirt without an orgasm.|`|c99ac5c47b8867c38f908f6c6af89662aa	Women who can squirt make up only a small portion of women who can achieve orgasm. So to answer your question  YES|`|0338c488a3870350dbcb59e6c04825b8aa	Why do people always think it's urine?!  It is NOT urine.  There have been many differing opinions on where the fluid comes from and it does have some of the same properties as urine (acidity, etc.).  If any man has ever had a woman who has had a squirting orgasm, then they can smell it and then they will know it is not urine at all!  And, in reply to the previous poster, there can be a quarter cup of fluid released upon orgasm, and it ain't "pee."  Anyway, to answer your question, refer to the poster above.  You can't squirt without having an orgasm but most women orgasm without squirting.|`|TEb6g8suaa	A woman can orgasm and not squirt.<br>  <br>  A woman can orgasm and squirt.<br>  <br>  The squirting orgasm is controversial - some will say it is pee, others will say it is nothing more than a little discharge, and others claim it can be just as powerful and have as much volume as a male's ejaculation.<br>  <br>  I fall into the latter camp.<br>  <br>  I believe that any woman can learn to squirt, many women who 'cannot' squirt probably have not done so because they have not wanted to, or have not tried, or because their belief (that it is impossible) gets in the way.<br>  <br>  If you would like to squirt, this is a good way to do so:<br>  <br>  1. It’s ALWAYS important to engage in foreplay. A woman’s sexual arousal takes place first and foremost in her brain. As such, never underestimate the power of foreplay. Instead of just trying to get her in the mood minutes before making love though, try to really build sexual tension by starting foreplay hours or even days in advance. This ‘pre-conditions’ her mind and body so that she’s more ready to squirt from G spot stimulation.<br>  <br>  2. Now, it’s time to locate the G spot. Once she’s wet and ready, ask her to lie on her back, her back supported by soft pillows. You may want to engage in oral sex first to ensure that she’ll welcome your fingers. Now, insert your index finger or middle finger or both slowly insider her wet womanhood, palm up. Once inside, position your finger(s) at 11 o’clock. Now, hook your finger in a “come hither” position. Shift your fingers slightly till you reach a spot that’s slightly rougher (some say it feels like the top of your mouth).<br>  <br>  3. Once you find her G-spot, stimulate it. There are several ways to stimulate the G-spot and each woman has her own ‘favorite’. You can try the ‘doorbell method’, which is basically trying to press and release a buzzer; you can flick it like a switch; you can draw small circles around; you can also stroke the G-spot. Try them all and see which one brings the best response.<br>  <br>  4. Prepare her mentally and emotionally for squirting. Some may say that this should be Step 1 but you see many women are actually uncomfortable discussing squirting. They feel embarrassed about it as they equate it with “peeing on their partner”. That’s why we put this step here. At this point – thanks to your G-spot stimulation – she’s probably already rearing for some form of release.<br>  <br>  It’s your job now to encourage her to just “let go” and that you’re perfectly OK with anything that will happen. Tell her you’re ready for her to squirt on you. In fact, you want her to do it. The point is to remove ANY inhibitions she may have about ejaculating or squirting on you. Removing this mental roadblock is often all that takes to ensure she moves forward and squirts from G-spot stimulation.<br>  <br>  If you feel that your partner is the type who would want to pre-discuss squirting from G-spot stimulation first, then by all means, make this Step 1.<br>  <br>  5. Not all women squirt equal. Some women may squirt a small amount, while others will squirt more. Either way, be prepared for anything. The worse thing you can do is to ‘jump out of the way’… hurting her physically and emotionally.<br>  <br>  <br>  Have fun!|`|tS4vOCJQaa	sometimes squirting happens right before orgasm as well.so it can go both ways,it can happen with or without orgasm. sometimes its just excitement(added lubrication.)

HX0H3FUZaa	Home Remedys:<br>  <br>  Put sweet oil inside the hurt ear and then stick a cotton ball inside it and lay down on the opposite side<br>  <br>  Mix white vinegar 50/50 with clean water. Drop into ear, and wiggle ear to ensure it goes all the way in. <br>  <br>  Side note: Vinegar of various sorts and in various concentrations is wonderful for other fungal infections as well. I rub it on my scalp for dandruff, for instant results. I pour apple cider vinegar in the bath for vaginal yeast infections, for instant relief and quick recovery. For fungus, vinegar works better and faster than any store-bought or prescription remedy. But only for fungus--for bacterial infections, vinegar can actually make the problem worse. So be sure you know what you're dealing with!<br>  <br>  For bad ear aches/infections squeeze lemon juice in your ear, keep it in for a few seconds, then let it drain out. I put a towel over my ear so it doesn't drain into my hair...that gets pretty sticky! The lemon has to do with changing the Ph levels in your ear. The bacteria is a base, and if you add the lemon, an acid, it neutralizes the Ph levels in your ear so that the bacteria cannot live in there!<br>  <br>  To cure an ear infection and pain of ear infection both for anyone of all ages, even infants, use garlic oil. Just break open a capsule and pour it in your ear. Lay down on the opposite side for a few minutess so it can drain in good. About 20 minutes later the pain should be gone and the ear will not bother you again, but it is good to do a second time after a few days just to be sure.<br>  <br>  one of these should help<br>  <br>  cp|`|9679eed4decfc91fdcea2e17ae362313aa	Use earplugs when you take a shower.

Also, there is really no way to get rid of an ear infection without going to the DRS.<br>  <br>  You don't want to take just one antibiotic because the germs can become resistant to it and then nothing will work and you could get sepsis and die.|`|vCJy0M6Daa	Hey!<br>  Well, if you have been having these problems for awhile, you may have to have tubes put in your ears, or get your tonsils removed, (thats what happened to me)<br>  Im sure you know that your ears and throat connected, and if you didnt know, you can definetly feel it.<br>  For now, put a few drops of hydrogen peroxide in your ears to help clear out the water, and if your going to self medicate with antibiotics, you must finish the bottle or take for 3 or 4 days. One wont do anything. You have to take a series of them.<br>  And make a doctors appointment!!!|`|oXvas8vTaa	A drop of rubbing alcohol in your ear might do the trick.<br>  <br>  But you should go to a doctor, like you said; I had a bad ear infection last year and it turned out to be a fungus growing on my eardrum. I can hear okay out of that ear now, but it did damage my hearing. However, I do not thing you're in the same situation as I. In the meantime before the doctor's office opens, just put a drop or two of rubbing alcohol in your ear and let it drain out.|`|f7ItJDnNaa	take an eye dropper if you have one and put hydrogen peroxide in your ears that what my mom did when my brother had really bad ear infection just put it in leave it for a few seconds and then dump it out :P|`|rev03i9saa	Go to a doctor immediately!<br>  lol, um, but seriously, go and see a doctor, like...now!<br>  xx<br>  <br>  go to the hospital.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|pkX2CGoraa	go on to www.videojug.co.uk and there is a video on there about a water diet..  you drink like bottled water for 2 days n bla bla n in 2 days u can loose like 5 pounds!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-lose-five-pounds-in-two-days" rel="nofollow">http://www.videojug.com/film/how-to-lose...</a>

c55O7jqXaa	Post Traumatic Syndrome and I suggest you get counseling. You need to get all of these bad feelings out and learn to move forward in your life and a doctor can help you with this. I am so sorry you had to go thru this. No one should have to go thru this. <br>  <br>  People don't realize how much a crappy childhood can mess you up as an adult. Those stick with you the rest of your life unless you get help.|`|WuskPQ6Qaa	.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	You my dear cannot continue to live there safely. You need to talk with mom first and tell her what is happening before another tragedy strikes. If she will not listen then call child protection. It's the only way and the only chance that you will have for a somewhat normal life. This can only get worse. You will need therapy from the assaults. If you want to get well then you will have to act on this now. You must want to or you would not have written what you did. So take the advice that is here because it is all meant to help you. You are not alone, nor will you be, even in those times you may feel like you are. There is a great deal of support out there so be brave, talk to mom and if you can't pick up that phone and ask for help. Maybe even your teacher at school could help you. If so then tell her as well, please. You have your entire life ahead of you and you can heal from all of this. It can start now. Good luck and you are in my prayers|`|zs7Wfl0saa	You should seek therapy. I have much less going on and I go to therapy and stuff, and it work pretty well. I highly recommend that you see a psychologist and/or psychiatrist. I really do hope things work out for you in the end. I'm sorry this all happened.|`|ZqGlQTFDaa	Yes, you can benefit from therapy. I was the victim of two sex assaults....And some other bad things that can happen....I found a therapist that I love and is sooo helpful. I have had one bad therapist before I found this one....If you don't like the first one you see, go see a new one! Keep trying out ones until you get one that is amazing. I saw a couple before this current one that were good but just not amazing...<br>  <br>  You are a survivor!! You can use your painful past as a motivation to have a great future!! Adversity makes you stronger. Some people that have never had real problems go thru live unappreciate and can't handle litlte things such as breaking a nail or a paper cut...bc they arent strong from surviving real trauma.<br>  <br>  I can survive anything after what I've been thruh...and same with you!!<br>  <br>  Good luck
IiiDPTxlaa	In average, girls usually get their period after a year and a half-2 years after their breasts start to grow, along with discharge. Its really hard to predict when your first period will come because its different for everyone. It could come tomorrow, or it could come in a year. Haha, sorry, this isnt what you want to hear, but its hard to determine. :) dgood luckk1|`|9pLdhuBnaa	Yes, it sounds like your period is coming soon but I would recommend letting your mom know what's going on as well so that she can help you keep an eye on this.
n7ykcFz5aa	actually yes you can do cheerleading if you have scoliosis! the other day i was reading an article in American Cheerleader Magazine and it was about a girl who had scoliosis but she was also a cheerleader. the doctor told her to keep on doing cheerleading because it actually helped her by making her get stronger<br>  (btw this article is in the american cheerleader magazine that has most recently been put out for sale)|`|BNrQSYwhaa	Depends on how big the degree it is as long as your back isn't arched back too far you should be ok.I have a friend who has it he says he can't do Sit ups or any exercise where he's lying on his back|`|ZCCFzvMBaa	My partner has scoliosis and can bike, run, roller-blade, swim, hiking, basketball and soccer.

SaINc1Plaa	Sometimes when I'm felling really horny, I get an old stuffed animal. If it is a small one, then I use the head, if it's a pretty big one, then I'll use the nose. I then press it against my clit and move it around in a circular motion. It's so cool!!!!!!|`|H8XpaaPDaa	go to the grocery store and be creative|`|5cXv0NAsaa	It all depends. If you want to go all natural you can just use your hands. Household items work as long as they're not sharp or oddly shaped so that they will be hard to pull out. Just make sure you wash whatever you use and put a condom over it so that bacteria doesn't get in your vagina. Shower heads are a definite ok. You can clean and please yourself at the same time. If you're looking disposable items (say fruit or vegetables) bananas or small cucumbers work great. Just remember to keep everything clean.|`|gC98RlU3aa	a woman actually killed herself using a carrot-no joke, internal bleeding. use ur fingers, just use clitoral stimulation.|`|JMnu0rBiaa	Call your dog over.<br>  Pffffffffffffffft.<br>  Is this question serious?|`|77b89da50334d58ffae963702c00caaaaa	A really hot pool boy?|`|ptrOZEpzaa	the back [non brush] end of an electric toothbrush is said to work like a vibrator|`|ICHzrALJaa	shower head, or running water from the bath tub tap, if you can manage to scooch yourself far enough towards it|`|c99ac5c47b8867c38f908f6c6af89662aa	If you are asking what to use, <br>  you probally shouldn't be doing it.|`|IMN5j1ZUaa	Rubix cubes fit in there nice
dFHsAXDMaa	As a nurse I will tell you .....the key if you are looking to loose weight is <br>  <br>  breakfast to jump start metabolism <br>  morning snack 2 hours later<br>  lunch two to three hours later <br>  afternoon snack<br>  dinner.<br>  you should not eat after two hours before going bed..for example if you go to bed at 10 do not eat after 8. this allows you body to digest food You ate and it will use store fat during the night to maintain itself<br>  <br>  avoid soda.. sugary drinks... limit fruit juices high in sugar..<br>  <br>  eat things like:<br>  oatmeal (will fill you more than cold cereals plus more nutritious )<br>  yogurt<br>  fruits<br>  veggies( with lite or low fat ranch)<br>  multigrain breads with low fat cold cuts (turkey based cold cuts are best) low fat cheese<br>  <br>  lite mayo or mustard<br>  fill sandwich with lettuce, bean sprouts and other veggies.<br>  portion of meat like chicken ,steak etc for a meal should be size of your fist read portion sizes on thinsg like rice and stick to one serving size<br>  <br>  just so you know instead of making salads and sandwiches with iceberg lettuce try spinach or baby spinach only has 21 calories in 3 cups and that is a lot of spinach makes big salad you can top with chicken or shrimp..<br>  <br>  exercise... walking.. jogging..crunches.. etc all this help to boost your metabolism ......the biggest mistake people make when trying to loose weight is not eating often enough which works against you by slowing your metabolism way down..hope this helped you and good luck|`|JYHlPczxaa	Hello<br>  <br>  First, I understand where you're coming from.<br>  Here's what I found out after lots of research and trial and error, the hard way.<br>  <br>  The reality is that there are no shortcuts or easy ways to get in good shape. Sorry, but someone needed to tell you this.<br>  As long as you get conscious about what you are doing, you will see the results. <br>  <br>  Below you will find the four principles that you need to keep in mind in your weight-loss journey.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a>   <br>  <br>  1.Forget About Diets<br>  <br>  People that go from diet to diet never reach a stable weight, let alone a good shape. The reason is quite simple: diets are, by their very nature, temporary. You can’t expect to eat properly for two or three weeks and fix your weight problems for the rest of the year.<br>  <br>  2.Proper Nutrition<br>  <br>  If you want to keep your weight and fat percentage under control, you will need to learn the basics of nutrition. Once you learn them, you will be able to eat healthy throughout the year.<br>  <br>  3.Physical Exercise<br>  <br>  Eating healthy and having a caloric deficit will only take you half the way. The other key factor is physical exercise.<br>  <br>  4.Discipline and Perseverance<br>  <br>  You can start eating healthy and exercising properly, but unless you stick doing it regularly, the results won’t appear (if they do, they won’t last).<br>  <br>  Discipline and perseverance are key here.<br>  <br>  If you want to Lose Weight,I can recommend you to check out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://theeverloss.blogspot.com/</a> .<br>  <br>  It is a great program that helped me.|`|8SRjELNBaa	don't eat a snack when you come home after school.  Drink water instad.|`|SvmCeex7aa	The most effective way to burn fat is to consume less food and exercise more, the difficulties arise when we really attempt to put that into operation! There are plenty of opportunities to fail in the real world don't you think?! The sole method that definitely delivered for me is green tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a few free trials left, it was featured in Fox News and USA Today. I melted away twenty five pounds, it definitely does produce success!|`|lOQQKkL8aa	go ona water fast or juice fast for about 3-4 days <br>  that will detox your system but once you stop just eat little by little to prevent from gaining the weight back and then you can start eating normal
ICtwYntuaa	Yes.  The other values look fine.  When you have a bacterial infection, your immune system fights it by increasing the number of white blood cells.  It's perfectly natural and actually a factor that helps in diagnosis of an infection.  You'll probably be prescribed some antibiotics and it'll go away in a few days :)|`|iqGaNZTtaa	Yes, the WBC count of 14,700 appears to be a response to your infection.
ICHzrALJaa	Douches upset pH balance, disappearing room for bacteria to grow. Also, you are in fact pushing bacteria further up the waterway, possibly through the cervix. That puts you at a higher risk for uterine infections and urinary tract infections.<br>  <br>  Vaginas are self cleansing.|`|wpsAuIuRaa	dont douche it will harm the elf inside of you you need to protect it! you'll never be able to harbour another dinosaur in your toes again<br>  DO NOT DOUCHE<br>  GET IT?<br>  NO DOUCHEY FOR YOU|`|MGXHme6Qaa	ur body is suppose to clean itself.  i have never douched and have never had a uti|`|cJRFbZUaaa	There's no need to douche.  Your body does a good job cleaning yourself down there; some people would argue that the period is itself a form of cleaning.|`|yfoNIRRvaa	yes its true,, your period cleans out ur vag anyway so no need for douching
phznG0mnaa	Anna you will cause more pain and heart ache by leaving us than if you stayed and talked to us everyday about what you are feeling . I would rather talk to you every time you got depressed than not have you in this world . I know you hurt and think you can't keep hurting us but we are here for you . That is what friends do . we talk and cry and at times get drunk and stupid this is called life and you not being part of it would hurt us so much more than you know  . Stay with us awhile longer and we can get through this together . This I promise .|`|F3KkB4GWaa	Well I think you should share your feelings with them. My friend does it to me. Even though I worry about him constantly now and it breaks my heart I'd way rather know how he's feeling and have him know that i'm there for him then not know and be blissfully unaware till the day he kills himself. That would hurt me more than anything he could ever tell me.|`|3reHk4I1aa	this is what i think... i think that you should journal all your thoughts especailly when you are sad. but more so when you are happy so that way when you are sad you can look at the happy thoughts that you were thinking even if it was from a long time ago and you need to figure out why you are feeling these things. maybe you should take sometime awayfrom all the stress and drama in you life and just relax maybe take a bath listen to soothing music. and drawing is a good way to express you feelings and as for you friends as long as they arent getting annoyed with all of you problems then they really seem like they want to help and since they do want to help you should tell them everything that way you are open and honest with all of your friends they have a right to know. i know that you dont want to bring them down but if they are your close friends and they love you then they will understand and try and help out the best way they can. and maybe you can set up a deal with them by saying if i am feeling down could i call one of you guys and then you guys could hang and talk about what is on your mind. and vent. venting is really good. trust you good friends not to walk away from you when you need them the most and plz tell them you wont regreat it (tell you good friends)|`|YKKe1BXlaa	well i know where you're coming from also. I have just recently been diagnosed with bipolar disorder. I attempted suicide my 8th grade year(i'm now a sophomore). They just diagnosed me with clinical depression. They prescribed me lexapro but I only took it for about 2 months. Then my freshman year I it got really bad. I flunked out. I didn't wanna do anything because I was so depressed that I stayed home and missed 40 days of school in a single semester. I have caught up now but the fact is that the whole time I wasn't talking to anyone about it. This year it got really bad. I would wake up happy and come back from lunch at school and be depressed any sometimes cry for just no reason at all. I just felt that way. I would also get suicidal thoughts. But I eventually went into the doctor and got help. You really should do more research. You may have something like bipolar. Try to see if your doctor can try you on a mood stabilizer. Who knows, it may help:). Also join this support group. It really helps. You can talk about anything with other people that suffer from the same thing as you do. I know it has really helped me! Here is the link www.dailystrength.org|`|T8WFrELhaa	i wrote like a paragraph and then deleted it cause you deleted youre question :( dont do it! because i care. i think you should keep seeing your therapist cause bottling up feelings can make things worse, if you dont feel only therapy is helping you should also take up art or music or writing.... i hope you feel better. i am going through the same thing if that helps at all. let those around you know how much you love them|`|WFhOUUIaaa	I hate to sound ignorant and biased. However I am not, because I have had the same feelings and thoughts you have described, but It kinda sounds like you are along the lines of "emo". You haven't described much of a reason why you have been depressed for years on end. And you keep saying you are "hurting" your friends but if you were hurting them, they would not be your friends. BUT: you say if you tell your friends the dark thoughts and feelings out they will suffer the same. you should keep your friends, but maybe find a positive common factor in another individual who you more or less "admire" [not to become obsessive]. Write down what you truly VALUE in a human relationship whether it be your own family, friends, coworkers, or others you come in contact.  when you say you can't get better, well you definitely won't by telling yourself that. Therapy ISN'T for everyone, and if you've included yourself in that area, then perhaps what the other person said, find something to devote your mind to. anything that gets your mind away from yourself. I would like to talk to you more about this because like i Mentioned before, I have similar thoughts and feelings, but I know suicide is ONLY a last resort. my email is nawta.star@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  if you truly want some constructive advice or even just someone to vent to, please email me.<br>  <br>  oh my names Alyssa btw. :]|`|rHHm4XNpaa	you control your emotion. No pills and no therapy can't control your brain...  ONLY YOU control your brain!!!<br>  <br>  What you need to do is... put this sadness away, put it in the box, and put them away.....   <br>  <br>  and get up and make yourself happy, be happy about anything, just find something to make yourself happy....<br>  <br>  Listen some music, go to club, and drink some tea and relax....<br>  Eat some good food...<br>  Ask your friends to go with ya....<br>  <br>  Get up and dance in the club... have a good time...<br>  make your friends happy...|`|lGdrvXMdaa	I am sorry you are going through this.<br>  First of all, it sounds like you don't like yourself. What happened in your childhood. Did you have a bad relationship with your parents?<br>  Did they degrade you? Do you have siblings that you have problems with?<br>  <br>  You didn't mention if you are male of female.<br>  In a female, you could have a harmone  imbalance.<br>  Have you ever taken or are you taking any kinds of drugs.<br>  You have a bad chemical imbalance going on, Have you been to the Dr. for any blood test?<br>  <br>  You are a child of God, and just remember, He made you, and he does not make "Junk". <br>  <br>  You need to find out what is causing such a horrible imbalance, and get it back on the right track.<br>  You are going to do just fine.
mwW4zIwIaa	Usually you have to do those a couple of times. I heard like 3~7 times, though I don't remember very well.<br>  <br>  I heard sticking duct tape on the wart works. They change the duct tape once in a while for around 2 weeks, and it was gone because it took all of the dead skins off.<br>  <br>  Some people, although painful, cut through the wart and letting it expose to air (which kills the germs, apparently).<br>  <br>  I have a wart on my finger, too. But it's going away slowly.<br>  I had the wart for around 1 year, though.|`|pod9nzo7aa	Sell it to someone.<br>  <br>  Or wart medicine. If you want to get it off badly, cut it. But it will have a lot of blood and hurt a lot.|`|VzBAzdfwaa	freeze the **** out of it than take a new razor blade so it is super sharp then cut it off|`|R0cxoUkDaa	There are medicated disc that you can buy at the store that work pretty well.
31fd278ee422095a5f1153f3ba3dfbeaaa	To me, your weight is perfect for your height. If you feel good, and don't eat junk food, if you exercise and keep the sweets level down, what's the problem . I don't know if your wellness training teacher is a professional, but before you start trying to add body fat, see your doctor. Frankly, you sound very healthy to me.
Iv9Y8lb0aa	i have the saaaame problem !!! and your right by your picture nothings wrong with you !!!!! but i know that no matter how much people will say that to you, it feels good but the truth is your the only person who can really approve of yourself<br>  <br>  i doubt that any real girl feels 100% confident with herself theres always gonna be that one flaw that only you can see on yourself<br>  <br>  honestly i havent really found a way to gain my full confidence but im writing just to let you know that everyone see's flaws on themselves and your not alone!! as long as you take good care of yourself and dont let yourself go you will be ok !!! no one else really sees the little flaws that you see so try to keep that in mind<br>  <br>  =)|`|aMBQLNGqaa	hmm I've been there not too long ago , I'm now 18 and I think that I've come pretty far in the last five years regarding my belief in myself especially when there are a lot of people around me who don't like themselves and keep complaining about how they look etc...<br>  <br>  you feel the confidence of other girls because they themselves love and accept who they are and they are projecting that to the world,<br>  <br>  one way that I'm sure would give you confidence is in self achievement, if you love doing something then do your best to excel in that, whether it's sports or academics or art or singing, then from there you build your confidence by thinking that "hey I can excel in these things so I'm pretty good right?"<br>  <br>  another thing would be to try to be happy because optimism can project confidence too<br>  <br>  good luck dear!|`|DDIZsZWeaa	I think you are pretty! yuo have really pretty highlights in your hair, your eyes are a pretty shape, and a nice tan.  Instead of looking at all the things you dont like about yourself look at the good things.|`|8SRjELNBaa	you're pretty.....<br>  <br>  You don't see it because you don't trust others.  Some significant event in your past probably caused it.|`|nN8D64Yzaa	well first of all, you're gorgeous, but i know that even if other people tell you that it can be hard to believe it yourself. <br>  try to remind yourself that it's impossible to be perfect, and people who have confidence are those who embrace their flaws and don't dwell on them. <br>  remember that to be upset over wahat you don't have is to waste what you do have, and negative thoughts can never help you. <br>  when you look in the mirror, don't stare at your thighs in horror or curse a bad hair day--think about what's beautiful about you, and focus on those things. when you're more secure with yourself and confident in who you are, other people will notice and see you as a more fun and outgoing person. <br>  <br>  good luck with everything and remember to stay positive :)
t9Nw86Plaa	Before I answer, I just need to say that the pill affects all women in a slightly different way - some gain weight, some lose weight, some have no weight changes, some have less acne, some have more acne, some have no change in acne.... and I've known women who have experienced all of these effects! So my answer is purely my own personal experience.<br>  <br>  I found that I gained weight, but only in the beginning. I gained about 10lbs on my first few months on the pill (however, I was also eating more, more stressed and exercising less.. so I dont blame the pill completely, but I think it did have some influence). After about a year and a half on the pill, I am back down to roughly my original weight (maybe a few pounds over).<br>  <br>  I also found that my skin cleared up A LOT. I used to have at least a couple of pimples all the **** time, but now I only have them once in a blue moon (usually corresponding to when I go off the pills during the placebo week!)|`|mAQHyfCYaa	I never gained weight but my breasts did get a bit bigger but that was the only thing that got bigger. No noticeable weight gain.<br>  <br>  As for acne it did help out with mine. I never get it now and I used to get it really bad. Now I only get one or two pimples before my period.<br>  <br>  However everyone will react slightly different. So until a woman starts taking the pill she won't know exactly how it effects her.|`|ITr2OGl5aa	Depends on which brand you are using, but generally most brands will clear any acne you currently have, or will have while using the pill. As for weight gain, it really just depends on your body type. If you are normally thin then the chances of you gaining weight are slim. In closing, both changes happen over a matter of months, they're not immediate.|`|d0WQ2pZNaa	it depends on your body, I know some women who have perfectly clear skin while on the pill, and put on no weight.<br>  some girls put on weight but gain a great complexion.<br>  others gain weight but their complexion stays the same.<br>  While other girls have no effects like this at all.<br>  <br>  <br>  it rely depends on the person.|`|Kq6a0PSJaa	i have found that i gained weight and my boobs got bigger but i never had acne so i dont know about that
eU0eQ9EWaa	You can't really go wrong with beans in general...<br>  <br>  Yes, they're starchy, but contain a special kind of starch that does not digest quickly like regular starch, which can be found in potatoes.<br>  <br>  As a matter of fact, that kind of starch has been shown to improve insulin (blood sugar) sensitivity by making the body more tolerant to glucose.<br>  <br>  Seeing as your father is diabetic, I wouldn't blame it on the beans. But if want 100% safe beans, try legumes. They're pretty good.

Now that they are done though, the top and bottom teeth look great!<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Not sure what the poster below me is talking about, but I am talking about a fixed bridge that is cemented into your mouth.

Guys really don't care if you wear perfume (we think it stinks) or lots of makeup (we all talk about how some girls get carried away and look like clowns) or strange and bizarre shoes and clothing (though we do laugh when someone in bizarre outfits walk out of the sound of our voices).  Be yourself, that's the most important thing, wear what is comfortable and looks best on you. And don't mess with mother nature, you have pubes for a reason.  Not sure what they are, but they have or did have a purpose when we all ran around bare-assed.|`|0nLdwZP2aa	I don't shave it completely because the aftermath sucks - razor burn and ingrown hairs.  I have a bikini trimmer that I use to keep my pubic hair trimmed short and neat.<br>  <br>  While guys have different opinions, I think most of them would be fine with it if you kept your hair neat - they won't demand it to be completely clean shaven.  Most guys will just be happy they get to have sex with you, honestly.|`|PImvmP1paa	Trim it. Don't shave it. <br>  <br>  Pubic hair is there for a reason.

He may also be thinking about things that doesn't get him hard or that gets his erection to go away. <br>  <br>  He may have had a traumatic experience when he was young and suppressed it and either doesn't want to talk about it or he actually forgot about it, but it's still there. Nothing is ever really forgotten.|`|MoFrhr0iaa	It does not seem like it is you.  Could he have a physical problem? Could he have a problem with his sexuality?  Or could it be a emotional problem like abuse as a child.  Could he be taking drugs that effect his erection?  Could he be overly eager?|`|OFP4ZCAgaa	sorry to tell you,, but he is too young to suffer from erectil dysfunction.,. leaving only one other thing, he is gay... and doesnt want to admit it to himself or you|`|1oNi2v38aa	I will need pics to confirm whether it's on your part or his.|`|0nLdwZP2aa	It is not you.  It's either psychological or physical.<br>  <br>  A really good test is this:  does he get morning wood?  Can he/does he masturbate?  If so, that means his physical response is probably working ok, and the issue is just psychological.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately, that can be a bit harder to treat.  If you really like this guy, then talk to him and tell him this - that you love him and it's not about the sex.  However, him not being able to get an erection, doesn't mean you can't have a sexual relationship.  Do things that take the focus off his erection - there are plenty of other things he can do to please you that don't require it.  And do things for him like giving him head, etc, where if he's not 100% hard it doesn't really matter.  Getting over this is a long but ultimately rewarding journey, but don't get started on it if you don't have the patience to work on this with him.<br>  <br>  This is also something that therapy - like talking to a psychologist - could really help him with.  He should look into options for that, as well.|`|M9YBxkhqaa	Few possibilities:<br>  1.Hes just nervous<br>  2.He masturbates wayy to much and when it comes time for you he cant get hard<br>  3.Hes gay<br>  4.He has some kind of disfunction idk..<br>  5.Its you, which i doubt|`|MKYvSVRfaa	sorry but if its happens a lot then hes gay and wont admit it. ask him questions and try to find some signs that he might be|`|2cM31cmaaa	buy your boyfriend "horny goat weed"|`|fomkCUCiaa	First of all, age means nothing. Boys start popping boners around the age of 3 or 4, so maybe he has erectile dysfunction. of course that's quite embarrassing, but it can be solved with viagra, or any other pill that can enhance performance or "make a man larger."<br>  <br>  Now if it isn't his fault, and it's you not doing enough, sometimes actions do speak louder than words, or vice versa. perhaps if your body language isn't good, try using dirty words to get him up. and if your words don't work, try grabbing his penis and start rubbing it, no matter if it's up or down. and if that doesn't work, start licking it. that's almost 99% guaranteed to work. or, ask if he has a fantasy. every man does.

(but take longer)<br>  Try eating citrus fruits, tamarinds, fishes, lobsters, crabs, prawns<br>  <br>  Natural Home remedies for the treatment of leucoderma:<br>  <br>  Simple home remedy for leucoderma using Ginger : Mix 15 gms. of bapchi with 30 ml. of ginger juice. When both of them get dry, mix 45 gms. of sugar and grind. Take a tsp. of it daily with cool water once in the morning an hour after meals. Apply bapchi oil on white spots. Sometimes a patient develops blisters or latches because of the application of bapchi oil. Therefore, great precaution should be taken in its application. Even, if there is a slight problem do not use it. Initially, apply bapchi oil only on patch of half an inch at one place for four days. If there is no reaction, you may use it on all the white spots. If the disease is in its early stages, it gets cured in five months.<br>  <br>  How to get rid of leucoderma - Getting rid of leucoderma<br>  <br>  Good home remedy for leucoderma using walnut : Walnut tree has such a toxic effect that the soil around the roots of the tree gets blackened. There are several accounts in books saying that eating walnuts regularly cures leucoderma.<br>  <br>  Effective home remedy for leucoderma using neem : Grind dry neem leaves, flowers and fruits in equal quantity and take a tsp. of it daily with water. This is beneficial for the treatment for leucoderma.<br>  <br>  Natural home remedy for leucoderma using alfa-alfa : Mix 100 gms. each of alfalfa and cucumber juice and drink it daily.

rycgejE7aa	Some scientists claim that contagious yawning is the result of feelings of empathy. Others say that it's a response to a stressful situation-- yawning increases oxygen intake and blood flow to the brain. <br>  <br>  "We know that much of yawning is due to suggestibility -- it's infectious. You don't need to actually see a person yawn to involuntarily yawn yourself; hearing someone yawn or even reading about yawning can cause the same reaction. Chances are you'll yawn at least once while reading this article.<br>  <br>  But contagious yawning goes beyond mere suggestibility. Recent studies show that the phenomenon is also related to our predisposition toward empathy -- the ability to understand and connect with others' emotional states. It sounds strange, but whether or not you're susceptible to contagious yawning may actually be related to how much empathy you feel for others.<br>  <br>  First, your mouth opens and jaw drops, allowing as much air to be taken in as possible. When you inhale, the air taken in is filling your lungs. Your abdominal muscles flex and your diaphragm is pushed down. The air you breath in expands the lungs to capacity and then some of the air is blown back out.<br>  <br>      * The Physiological Theory -- Our bodies induce yawning to drawn in more oxygen or remove a build-up of carbon dioxide. This theory helps explain why we yawn in groups. Larger groups produce more carbon dioxide, which means our bodies would act to draw in more oxygen and get rid of the excess carbon dioxide. However, if our bodies make us yawn to drawn in needed oxygen, wouldn't we yawn during exercise? Robert Provine, a psychologist at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, and a leading expert on yawning, has tested this theory. Giving people additional oxygen didn't decrease yawning and decreasing the amount of carbon dioxide in a subject's environment also didn't prevent yawning.<br>  <br>      * The Evolution Theory -- Some think that yawning is something that began with our ancestors, who used yawning to show their teeth and intimidate others. An offshoot of this theory is the idea that yawning developed from early man as a signal for us to change activities.<br>  <br>      * The Boredom Theory -- In the dictionary, yawning is said to be caused by boredom, fatigue or drowsiness.

Go to www.norm.org and read about the reason and the function of the foreskin.  Cutting it off will not make your penis cleaner.  The foreskin/glans combination produce Langerin which is a powerful anti microbial compound that keeps diseases at bay.  No foreskin, not disease protection.  <br>  You should rethink this as you are very fortunate to have your foreskin.  Lots of guys wish they still did.|`|fomkCUCiaa	I don't know exactly how much it costs, but $1000 seems reasonable. but i'm warning you, there's only local anesthesia used in circumcisions, so if you're gonna do it, it'd be the most painful thing you might ever do.|`|VzBAzdfwaa	2000-4000$ if your insurance doesn't cover it. they will have to use anesthesia and that's not cheap|`|EwmHsEoiaa	Having a circ at that age will stop the growth of your penis.  Why?  because your body will spend the energy on repairing the penis rather than putting it into growing normally.  A lot of blood vessels are lost in circumcision and when the blood vessels fill with blood this stretches the penis longer.<br>  <br>  If you are going to do it wait till you are older.<br>  <br>  I am against circumcision.  It is falling out of favour.  The foreskin is an important part of the penis.  Mine doesn't itch - maybe you are doing something wrong?<br>  <br>  The foreskin is an important part of the penis.  It contains many nerves on it's underside.  When the foreskin is moved up and down it is very pleasurable.  Circumcised men have lost this ability as there is no gliding effect.  So they have to use artificial lubrication to masturbate or even in sex.  See here for the importance of the foreskin:<br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/naturalresources" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/painfulquestioning/...</a><br>  Without the foreskin protecting the glans, circumcised men lose further sensitivity.  The glans dries out.  It also brushes on underwear causing the skin to toughen.  See here for the full damage done:<br>  <a href="http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.noharmm.org/IDcirc.htm</a><br>  <br>  There are good reasons to believe that sex  is better for the woman as well, if the man has his foreskin intact:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F/doctor_northrup.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexasnatureintendedit.com/10F...</a><br>  <br>  You aren't dirty - you are normal.  Everything produced by the body is natural.  There are a lot of myths going around about the foreskin - these come from people who have no foreskin.  They think - there must have been some reason to have part of my dick chopped off without my consent?  Actually there wasn't. you can read a history of circumcision here:<br>  <a href="http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.historyofcircumcision.net/</a>|`|dM9pHrQIaa	It might night be itching because it's dirty--you're not supposed to use soap in there, you know.  Just try using water or Cetaphil (I think that's what it's called) cleanser to clean it out.  The "skin" in there is just like the inside of your eyelid or mouth, it gets irritated really easily and that could be the "itch."  <br>  <br>  Definitely wait on getting circumcised until you're older.  Think it over, because you can't get it back, even if you "restore" it by stretching, it's still gone for good.  Look at some pics of circumcised penises online--all dried out, wrinkly, and scarred.  :S
9lZdDU2Vaa	Diabetes is a disorder in our body,which means when our pancreas does not produce enough insulin in our blood to control excess glucose in our blood which is known as diabetes.Your body weight should be around 52 kgs to 56kgs.|`|6NA2MXNPaa	I'm attaching a website for you where you can calculate your BMI to figure out what weight you should be at. You typically should aim to keep your BMI between 19.5-21. You can type in different weights to see where you are and where you should be if you're not in the correct range.<br>  <br>  As for the diabetes, do you have Type I or Type II? Diabetes is when your pancreas doesn't work right and isn't making insulin or doesn't make enough insulin. Therefore you have to take injections of insulin to supplement your body so that it can then break down the sugar in your blood. Without insulin your body can't break down sugar and you will become hyperglycemic. I hope that helps.

You have to get your appetite under control! If you can get food out of your head then you can lose that weight. I had to lose over 30 pounds which isn't a ton but still, it took will power (which I didn't really have) and to gain some and get control of my appetite as well. I used hoodia. It's a natural supplement and not a diet pill. I got mine from desert burn hoodia and swear to God the first day I actually forgot to eat and I never felt light headed or fatigued or weak at all, just not hungry or even interested in food at all really. In just a few weeks I was down 15 pounds and I think it only took me like 2 months to lose about 33 pounds. I started walking as well on a treadmill and the lard really kinda fell off. I was so psyched that I started my own website so if you want, and I hope you do, please Google: online health desert burn hoodia :if you would. You can even cut and paste it into google Hope this helps you.  P.S. Hoodia is good to have around everytime you wanna drop a couple of pounds.

Done properly and consistently, they should add close to an inch or two to your penis in six weeks.<br>  <br>  1. Penis stretches. This one is very simple. Just take your flaccid penis and stretch it as far out in front of your body as it will go. Do it gently and gradually and hold it there for thirty seconds. Rest ten seconds between sets and repeat this at least ten times.<br>  <br>  2. Jelqing. This is another great technique for rookies. Get your penis halfway erect, apply lubrication, and grip it tightly at the base with the thumb and forefinger of one hand. Slowly slide that hand up the shaft toward the tip, pushing as much blood into your penis as possible. When you reach the tip, immediately grip the base the same way using the other hand and repeat. Do this nonstop for ten minutes.<br>  <br>  3. Ulis. This is a great exercise to increase girth. It is also very easy and does not take much time. Achieve a full erection and grip the base of your penis the same way you would if you were jelqing. <br>  <br>  Squeeze as hard as you can without causing discomfort. Your penis shaft should swell and your penis head should get big and shiny. Hold for ten seconds and rest for ten seconds. Repeat this three or four times.<br>  <br>  Do this routine every other day and make sure you warm your penis up before each workout by wrapping it in a hot washcloth for five minutes.<br>  <br>  4. A larger penis can be achieved with the use of penis enhancers. There are many forms of penis enhancement products such as pills, patches and topical oils. However, one unique natural product that can produce significant results and makes use of the body's natural abilities comes in the form of a liquid called super-vir <a href="http://www.super-vir.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.super-vir.com</a><br>  <br>  Always remember, if you are not satisfied with what you were born with, it is never too late to do something about it!|`|mnwPK6Ykaa	You become proud of your member.<br>  Girls don't judge the size of your penis<br>  They judge the ammount of confidence you have in it.|`|4iaAfQQeaa	Hi<br>  <br>  Using penis enlargement exercises, Google that < for the details <br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|TnaeRXJkaa	There is really no SAFE way.

ULkqriEhaa	Panic attacks are usually fearing fear, does that sound like it? Often people who have them worry about having them in public or more often so they panic about panic!<br>  <br>  There can be many reasons as to why your having them...depends, i really suggest a psychologist or psychiatrist - there are medications out there for this type of thing, and it's not uncommon.<br>  <br>  They can occur randomly and out of no where, there may not be some huge underlying reason - but there are helpful treatments to manage panic attacks.|`|nOrWOZU4aa	I've had those for years, and I remember telling my doctor something was wrong and I didn't know what and he suggested a psychiatrist, which me seemed stupid.  A couple more years of suffering with it and I find out it was anxiety or panic attacks.  Stupid doctor.  Anyways, a few more years of anxiety attacks showing up for no reason, but I did discover some causes.  Caffiene is a major source of panic attacks for me, and not right away usually, but a couple of hours later.  Caffiene is in chocolate, coffee, tea, mountain dew, coke, sports/energy drinks and some butterscotches.  Loud noises can set off an attack, from a nail gun to a plane going over head to a baby crying.  After I quit smoking I noticed that I had less attacks as well.  I am down to about 5 percent of the amount of attacks that I did have.  I also notices that if I had a panic attack at a certain place, then when I went to that place again, I would start to get nervous that I would have another there and sure enough if it wouldn't start to happen again.  Panic attacks can also be brought on by just talking about them.  I was listening to a woman on tv describing hers and I had to change the channel, I could feel the same happening.  I hope this was some help.|`|iybezfi6aa	Panic attacks are for the most part random, especially at first. Then what happens is that people will associate them with whatever was going on at the time and they will stop doing that whatever it is.

Chicken is the healthiest meat that you can eat. Grilled is the best way to cook it. Steamed veggies. Salads with minimal dressing. My trainer told me that I need to eat 6 times a day small meals and my husband to eat 8 because a man's body need more calories. He eats a lot of yogurts, fruit and veggies, tuna salads, grilled chicken slices, and celery and peanut butter.

You can brush your teeth with out pain. You can eat steak (as long as it's soft) and you can eat whatever, except popcorn and hard chips and gums.<br>  <br>  But trust me, the braces are easier to deal with than the spacers. Spacers are friggin misery. <br>  <br>  The tighting made my teeth sore for 2-3 days. But then I was free again to eat whatever. <br>  <br>  But for the first month, I only reccomend chicken as meat. But don't worry, there's all kinds of chicken, it goes well with anything and can go in anything. Also soft sausage.<br>  <br>  Also salads, that crunchy part of some leaves, take it off. It hurts. <br>  <br>  You might want to carry around a compact mirror and take a paper clip and lift one of the ends up where it looks like a little gun or something, and you want to pick stuff out of the top of your braces. <br>  <br>  Don't eat a hot pocket, the cheese will cover your entire mouth and you will look like a monster. <br>  <br>  If you want to numb the pain in your teeth, take an ice cube and put it in between your teeth, DON'T BITE, let it melt and it will numb your teeth for about 10 minutes so you have a little more freedom that you had before.|`|ajyfxFDuaa	ok first off to tell you the truth it didn't hurt as much as i thought it would. It just feels a tiny bit sore and that's it. They hurt for about 5 days then you are back to normal. After the soreness went away i ate everything i ate before including meat. The only thing i had problems with was nuts.

A late bloomer with them lol. I got them when I was 38 years old!  It was hell on earth for 2 years.  My son had them when he was in 8th grade. No pain, no problem.  See, the older you are, the harder it is to move the bone in the gum which the teeth are set in.  So the bone is moving with the teeth.  I could eat and pain was the worst when he would tighten them.  I would wake up the next morning, holding my whole mouth and moaning with tears coming.  I couldn't eat even a slice of bread, it was so bad.  That would last about 3 days and then I was ok.. I would take Bufferin to help with the pain.  It did a little something, but not much.   The braces were metal as this is what my doctor recomended.  Sometimes the wire would stick out into the back of my jaw and cause me to get a huge canker sore!  Misery again.. My son had none of these problems and kinda breezed thru it.  He even had to have the spacer on the roof of his mouth to widen the roof.. That bothered him a little but not too bad.  Food would get stuck in it when he ate.  So, the older you are the more the pain is from my experience.  Younger is much better.. Good Luck and hope I didn't scare you off with my story.

689efd040f7aee45255236da1af351baaa	It depends upon the type of stress you are under. If it is related to work, I will say attend to work first, do that without feeling stressed about the results. Once you are exhausted and tired (not because of stress but because of work) do a 5 minutes meditation at <a href="http://clicktomeditate.com" rel="nofollow">http://clicktomeditate.com</a>  and go to sleep, you will have a good quality sleep. If you sleep while meditating that is fine too.<br>  <br>  If you are stressed because you have no work but worry about something (and believe me there are many things in the world to make someone worries, how about a meteor going to hit you from the space??). In this situation find out some work to do, if you are rich enough go find the people who need your help and help them out, then once you are exhausted your worries will be gone then go to <a href="http://clicktomeditate.com" rel="nofollow">http://clicktomeditate.com</a> and meditate for 15 minutes, you will feel relaxed.<br>  <br>  If you are stress free then simply clicktomeditate and enjoy some cool meditations.<br>  <br>  Meditations are cool anyway !!!|`|AA10565336	Three ways to relieve stress that I have tried.<br>  <br>  1.  Medication (works some times)<br>  2.  Meditation (works some times)<br>  3.  Exercise (when intense it works every time)<br>  <br>  The parenthetical statements are my results, and mine alone.  <br>  <br>  The medication I tried turned me into a zombie.  They didn't really relieve the stress they just put me into a stupor so I didn't care.  After a short time my personality started to change.  My wife and the men I sent off to war pointed it out to me.  I stopped the medication.  It just wasn't worth the side effects.<br>  <br>  Meditation took the form of shooting.  I tried to relieve it on the pistol range.  The intense concentration required and the tunnel vision one develops helps.  When the only three things in the world are rear sight, a front sight and a target there is little room for anything else.  When stress was fairly light it worked but when the stress load was heavy the stress overpowered the tunnel vision and concentration.  The result was no relief and a lousy score.<br>    <br>  As for exercise I used to play table tennis (Ping Pong) at a competitive level.  An hour of that cleared all my stress load and it did it every time I tried it.  Walking, even miles only gave me more time to think about the lives I controlled and how easy it would be for me to make a fatal error.  It took intense exercise with the mind coming into the mix.  Something intense and competative was what I required.  But, when I got there, it was almost 100% effective.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|23bs0kAKaa	Honestly i have tried it, and it makes it worse, cause for example if im stressed about a test at school or project or something, then im thinkin to myself, WHAT THE FU(K AM I DOIN MEDITATING I SHOULD BE WORKING ON THAT RIGHT NOW, IM JUST WASTING TIME!!<br>  <br>  But if its over stuff like, women, or what i want as a career (i dont know) it helps cause its relaxing. <br>  <br>  Depends on your situation and why you are stressed i would have to say :)|`|zyoFZ9dtaa	b nm|`|z9nK2zdjaa	Definitely. it will help you a lot.

Since I can not do these things I will tell you 2 things 1)  sometimes chest xrays "lag behind" clinical symptoms, this means that when something first starts (you are experiencing symptoms) the chest xray often does not show it, but will show it hours to days later. 2)  you should go to another doctor, if you have a family physician try them if not, and you still feel bad go to an  after hours clinic or back to the emergency room.|`|rIOD8tgvaa	You may be having a spontaneous pneumothorax.  It is caused by a bleb or air sac in your lungs.  It causes your lung to collapse.  You can have a slow leak.  It is good you had a x-ray but, you need someone trained to identify the blebs.  Are you feeling a shortness of breath or chest pain?  If so, go back to the emergency room and get the help you need.  A Cardio-thorasic surgeon can help you.

0nyWiro9aa	Good question<br>  <br>  Most of the coagulation factors are produced in the liver and so one way is to have a liver transplant with a normal liver.

La positività degli autoanticorpi circolanti, anti-tireoperossidasi (anti-TPO) e anti-tireoglobulina (anti-TG), sottende la patogenesi autoimmune e, al tempo stesso, ha un fondamentale significato diagnostico. I meccanismi del danno d’organo sono complessi e comprendono la partecipazione dell’immunità umorale e di quella cellulo-mediata.<br>  La tiroidite cronica autoimmune è la forma più comune di tiroidite e la sua prevalenza è nettamente superiore nel sesso femminile e nell’età avanzata. Qualora si prendano in considerazione anche le forme asintomatiche, definite dall’esclusiva positività anticorpale, esse sembrano costituire in assoluto la più frequente tireopatia, soprattutto se si considerano le aree non iodio-carenti.<br>  La definizione generale di tiroidite cronica autoimmune comprende le seguenti varianti morfologiche e cliniche:<br>  1. tiroidite di Hashimoto propriamente detta, caratterizzata da gozzo diffuso con o senza ipotiroidismo; <br>  2. tiroidite autoimmune asintomatica ad impronta atrofica, definita dalla positività autoanticorpale, in assenza di gozzo o di franco ipotiroidismo; <br>  3. mixedema idiopatico, che si manifesta con ipotiroidismo conclamato, in assenza di gozzo, con anticorpi spesso negativi. <br>  Considerando le tiroiditi autoimmuni nel loro insieme, si può dire che il quadro obiettivo-sintomatologico è assai variabile nei singoli soggetti, dall’assoluta asintomaticità, alla presenza di gozzo di variabili dimensioni, con o senza ipotiroidismo.<br>   Gozzo  <br>  Il gozzo è generalmente di piccole-medie dimensioni, diffuso, di consistenza aumentata o francamente duro, talora con aree pseudonodulari. La crescita della ghiandola avviene in modo lento e subdolo, è indolente e non provoca alcun disturbo soggettivo. La presenza di uno o più nodi, identificabili ecograficamente, può richiedere approfondimento citologico, per escludere una eventuale patologia neoproduttiva concomitante.<br>   Evoluzione della malattia<br>  L’evoluzione in senso ipofunzionale è imprevedibile nel singolo soggetto, poiché può manifestarsi in qualsiasi fase della malattia: talora rappresenta la manifestazione di esordio, ma più frequentemente compare in pazienti con positività anticorpale nota da anni. In molti casi, la comparsa di segni e sintomi conclamati di ipofunzione segue una fase di ipotiroidismo subclinico, che è definito dall’elevazione isolata del TSH, con normalità degli ormoni tiroidei, in pazienti del tutto asintomatici.<br>  La tiroidite di Hashimoto nella sua manifestazione classica consta di tre fasi; 1:ipertiroidismo transitorio, 2:Eutiroidismo, 3:Ipotiroidismo permanente.<br>  La progressione verso l’ipotiroidismo conclamato è più frequente nei maschi, mentre nelle donne la frequenza aumenta in età superiore a 45 anni.Nelle donne inoltre la patologia si manifesta con frequenza maggiore(rapporto uomo-donna 7:1). Spesso questa patologia è associata ad altre malattie autoimmunitarie, quali la vitiligine, l'alopecia, il diabete di tipo I,iposurrenalismo. In generale, è stato stimato che i pazienti con anticorpi positivi vadano incontro ad ipotiroidismo conclamato con una frequenza del 2-4% all’anno. Raramente si possono osservare fasi transitorie di iperfunzione, legate a rapida progressione del danno parenchimale con dismissione di ormone preformato o a fasi di ipersecrezione mediate da anticorpi stimolanti il TSH (cosiddetta Hashitossicosi). Del tutto eccezionale è la presenza di oftalmopatia autoimmune.<br>   Diagnosi<br>  La diagnosi si avvale, oltre agli elementi anamnestico-obiettivi, del dosaggio degli anticorpi antitiroide circolanti, in particolare degli anti-TPO, che risultano positivi in oltre il 90% dei casi. Utile supporto viene fornito dall’ecografia, che dimostra un’ecostruttura diffusamente ipoecogena, disomogenea, con margini irregolari e polilobulati.<br>   Trattamento<br>   In caso di ipotiroidismo conclamato, il trattamento universalmente riconosciuto prevede la somministrazione di L-tiroxina a dosaggio sostitutivo, tale da riportare il TSH nei limiti di normalità, tra 1 e 4 mU/l. La posologia di L-tiroxina è generalmente compresa tra 1 e 2 μg/kg/die, ma deve essere calibrata individualmente.<br>  Nei casi di tiroidite associata a gozzo, con o senza ipotiroidismo, può essere opportuno aumentare la posologia della tiroxina, in modo da ottenere la parziale o completa soppressione del TSH, con finalità antistrumigena. Nei casi di tiroidite senza gozzo e normale funzionalità tiroidea, o di ipotiroidismo subclinico (TSH compreso tra 4 e 10 μU/ml e ormoni tiroidei nella norma), l’opportunità di instaurare un trattamento deve essere valutata nel singolo caso, tenendo conto di vari fattori individuali quali:<br>  l’età, <br>  la coesistenza di patologie cardiache o di osteoporosi <br>  la capacità di collaborare e di sottoporsi a periodici controlli clinici e laboratoristici.|`|RPnfHcGlaa	Si chiama di Oshimoto!!!

This can help to lessen bloating.

jDflHYOzaa	confusing question because a girls period can last anywhere between 3-7 days if not more. <br>  <br>  Having sex with a girl on her period doesn't do anything except gets blood on the both of you and it can help ease cramps. When she is on her period but NOT having sex shes just uncomfortable and can be in a little bit pain depending on cramps/headache/backache. <br>  <br>  and for the last part of it are you talking about a girl who's has never before in her life or just between cycles? and really a girl having her period doesn't change her shes just irritable and uncomfortbale when shes on it...

A girl who has started her menstrual cycle (period) is fertile and capable (internally) to bare children.

2HETgiwgaa	Sweetie - your BMI is 20.6 now - in the healthy range (for adults) of 18.5 to 24.9 - if you lose 10lbs you'll be at the skinny end of healthy - at 18.89.  At your age, if you haven't already done so you should really check with your doctor before you try to lose weight - you are still growing, and what you're talking about is a VERY restricted diet in terms of calories, particularly for someone your age.  You'll probably lose the weight, but it could be to the detriment of your health.  I also don't think you are getting enough vitamins and minerals in your diet if the above is anything to go by - and you do need fat in your diet.<br>  <br>  Take care :)|`|spXPpyP0aa	yes|`|TU6hZ2Beaa	Very great idea!|`|zNn9VfRyaa	to lose weight u need to eat right and have a workout plan 5-6 days a week.u have to want it. <br>  ***try this u need to change ur diet. <br>  eat six times a day. ea of ur 3 main meals needs to combine a lean protein such as chicken breast ground turkey turkey bacon egg whts also combine that with a complex carb such as a baked potato or sweet potato wild rice brown rice oatmeal or girts. also add fresh fruit and vegies to lunch and dinner. pick fruits low in sugar like pears and berries. if u get canned vegies get ones with low sodium. eat every 3-4 hrs keep ur metablism moving.<br>  ***also the most important part is WATER drink at least 64oz. no soda or juice. water will curve ur cravings. <br>  u need to hit cardio 3-4 times a week running outside it great workout if u can hit a gym and cardio machine is great at least 30mins***<br>  also add weight/strength training 3 times a week.u can google free weight traning guides anywhere. its not hard to find things for free.<br>  ***plan ur meals ahead of time.always have a healthy snack with u so u wont be tempted to eat fast food. also if u wait to late to eat u will get so hungry u will eat the world. make time to work out start out with 30 mins then increase.its ur body treat it right. ur diet alone can help lose weight but working out makes ur body look good. shows muscles and tight skin which is sexy and beautful. stick with it ur body will amaze u!!! to be healthy and look great u need both in ur life. good luck email me if u have further questions
xKKUMqGTaa	In diarrhea, the food and fluids you ingest pass too quickly or in too large an amount — or both — through your colon. The fluids aren't sufficiently absorbed, and the result is a watery bowel movement. In addition, the lining of your colon may be inflamed or diseased, making it less able to absorb fluids. <br>  <br>  If you don’t have gastro or haven’t had it since your diarrhea started, it sounds like chronic, or long-term, diarrhea (comes on suddenly and stays for weeks).  <br>  <br>  If someone has long-term diarrhea, there is usually an underlying cause – sometimes it can be quite severe. Causes of long-term (chronic diarrhea can vary or be multiple. Common causes include viruses, bacteria, and parasites, digestive disorders, surgery (especially abdominal surgery), medications, and other things like artificial sweeteners, lactose and fructose. Underlying disease like Crohn’s disease, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, irritable bowel syndrome, or giardia (giardiasis – an intestinal infection caused by a world-wide parasite often causes diarrhea). Food intolerances are a common cause of diarrhea in allergy sufferers. Certain drugs, especially antibiotics, can cause diarrhea as a side effect. Magnesium-containing antacids and artificial sweeteners, such as sorbitol, are often overlooked culprits, as well. Have you had any testing for parasites, other bugs, or other potential medical conditions yet? <br>  <br>  With long-term diarrhea, it is highly recommended to consult your doctor. If your doctor can’t get to the root of things, you may be referred to a specialist, for testing and treatment. The doctor may be able to specify treatment based on your overall health and medical history, extent of disease, your intolerance for specific medications, procedures, or therapies, and your opinion or preference. <br>  <br>  One very important thing to remember is with diarrhea, a lot of fluid is lost. On average, a healthy human should be consuming about 1.5 to 2 litres of water daily. If you have diarrhea, you will be loosing much of your daily fluid intake. This fluid loss must be replaced for you to remain healthy. Depending on what your doctor recommends, you should keep up your fluid intake. If you don’t keep up fluid intake, you will become dehydrated, which can potentially lead to other health problems, and dehydration is only going to worsen whatever is causing your diarrhea anyway. Although you might think that the more fluid, the more diarrhea you’ll have, this isn’t true at all. To recover and remain healthy, your body needs a lot of fluid (unless you have other medical conditions which may counteract or affect this). <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you with understanding diarrhea and it is highly recommended you see a doctor as soon as possible because diarrhea should not last two months ever, unless there is a serious underlying cause. See your doctor soon! <br>  <br>  <br>  See this website for more about diarrhea - <a href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/diarrhea/DS00292" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/diarrhe...</a> .|`|24aa155727dc6a3e63a543ad65785b58aa	Rather then giving it another 2 months, Go see your health care provider.|`|AA10531094	Two months is way too long.

This will burn tons of calories and on top of all that force your body to burn more calories for the rest of the day.<br>  One last note - a lot of the girls I know just don't eat for two weeks - pleeseeee don't do this, it's very unhealthy and if you do the above methods you will still lose the weight. <br>  Good luck !!!|`|QuBlitnNaa	meth.... j/k excersise, tons of water and steriods, j/k just go to mens fitness.com and there is pleanty of info there...|`|MD7a2Rssaa	Cut off the limb of your choice.|`|b84dbf3830f45dea33849a6c6982a5dcaa	yes, running will help.<br>  also, your friends are right about sit ups and crunches, especially crunches... if you get to where you can do about 500 3 different times a day.. your stomach will get very nice and tone, and quick! but you have to keep it up!..<br>  <br>  good luck with that new sexy body!|`|d6ad88f3c453e1cf97f1edadef11951faa	You are doing just fine! (You can blame your genes for your booty!) Maybe, how about taking turns on working on 1 place then the other...<br>  BTWZ, I heard eating only raw tomato early in the morning for breakfast everyday helps and  that way, you maintain the glow on your face.<br>  Don't  eat anything for an hour or so.<br>  You can start slowly with your usual exercise routine and a half a lemon juice plus half a tsp honey added in a glass of warm water.  <br>  Take some fruits, yogurt, low-fat milk, oats cereal to start your day.<br>  A sandwich (with soup ,if desired) of different variations for lunch and some steamed vegetables, with or without some lean white meat either with a small bowl of rice or a slice of whole wheat bread (and soup, if desired) for dinner.<br>  You can always have celery and carrot sticks for munching throughout the day!<br>  Try to cut down on all those sugary desserts and have fresh fruits instead!<br>  And yes smile often!|`|kM7D2lxhaa	This will be difficult, if you like food, but it will be effective:<br>  <br>  To lose weight quickly, replace the carbs and junk you eat with large amounts of fruits and vegetables. The more fruits and vegetables you eat, the more weight you will lose. Do this at least two out of your three meals a day. That's probably a little more aggressive than a doctor might recommend, but it worked for me. <br>  <br>  I suggest letting breakfast be the one meal you eat whatever makes you feel energized. Oatmeal is good, maybe some whole wheat bread (don't even bother eating white bread.)<br>  <br>  AVOID junk food, sweet drinks, and fatty salad dressings. If you really need salad dressing, get a low fat, but I suggest Newman's Own Raspberry Viniagrette. Or Newman's ranch.<br>  <br>  And yes, run up and down those stairs. I suggest once in the morning and once in the evening.<br>  <br>  Now, granted, you're not going to lose ten pounds probably, because you don't seem to weigh enough to need to. But this is as close as you're going to get. You will notice a difference and probably even feel better.
Dh5CUjmkaa	It probably is infected. Take it out, clean the earring and your ear with either the cleaning solution you get when it was pierced or rubbing alcohol, then dip the post of the earring in antibiotic ointment and put some on the back too, then put them back in. Do this everyday and you will notice that the swelling will go down. There is no correct way to have your ears pierced, it is your preference. Plus, it takes a lot longer for your cartilage to heal than your earlobes so it may take quite a while for them to heal and you may be prone to infections for a long time. If you take them out you may still have the same issue if you let them heal and have them re-done.|`|SnTuaKcJaa	Take it out, let it heal, and get it done correctly at a piercing parlor with a needle.|`|drzN1kkuaa	Its not bad if it touches both sides of the ear.<br>  It may just be swollen, my ear was like that too.<br>  But dont clean it as much and touch it as much, <br>  the swelling will go down faster.|`|2cC2vyxBaa	The cartilage of your ear is more sensitive the the lobe part of your ear. I had my cartilage pierced about 4 years ago and well I no longer wear an earring up there very long or if at all because it always hurts and gets red and irritated. Do you know what the earring is made out of that is in that part of your ear because if it isn't gold or nickel free that could be irritating your ear. I also think it takes your cartilage longer to heal then your lobe part and that is partly because you cartilage is more vascular then the lobe. So I hope this is helpful.
ZoQwU2Juaa	for one, you have to consider this: has this been happening over a long time period? what have you eaten lately? are your stools abnormally in any way such as color or has there been blood? you may just have constipation. in my opinion, i would recommend taking milk of magnesia in accordance to the instructions on the bottle. a straight laxative is usually much too strong and will create more discomfort through diarrhea. milk of magnesia is much easier on  your system, and helps you to go controllably. it's best to get it out of your system! ther are also many others like this to try. if this does not work, then go to your doctor about this and maybe consider a colon cleanse. sorry if i was ever too gross, but i'm just trying to help! hope it all comes out okay! ;)|`|ecfdaa0025f15f95c0f55c59a87b000aaa	Stay off any foods containing refined flour, wheat or cereals.

Its a matter of individual sensitivity to motion in the visual field. <br>  <br>  Now if everything goes black and you see those white stars - that's different. And the best way I can explain that is to say its almost like a sneeze or cough of the optic nerve (which jerks on the retina, and the very short lived lack of blood causes the phenomena).<br>  <br>  If you are seeing them more than a couple times a year, I would suggest a visit to an ophthalmologist "just in case".

pHUsumU7aa	Yes weed is addictive, it's a mental addiction. It's not a physcial addiction,but it's really strong to kick- but you can do it. You need to find within yourself why you do it other than the feeling of being high. Sometimes it's the people around you that you need to kick too. When I quit, for good reasons, my friends were there to help me. They wouldn't smoke around me and wait to smoke til after we all hung out. If your friends aren't that courteous, you may need to kick them, I've had to do it too. In the long run they should either know why, or you may not need them at all. <br>  Delete all contacts, you know, your bud man, people you may sell to, or smoke with, and let them know you're quitting. If they ever don't take you seriously, or call you out on it, kick them too.<br>  It's kicking the habit, and they are apart of it.<br>  If it's stress or they way you wind down, or go to sleep, find a good substitute.<br>  Don't give yourself the time of day, or opportunity, to go blaze.<br>  Do all the research about how bad weed can be, and evangelize yourself.<br>  Realize that when you quit, you have more money, more breathe, not get as sick as often, etc.<br>  I hope this helps you get started. Just understand weed is one of the easiest substances that you abuse and can relapse on.|`|RnHDnSgPaa	im the same as you 19 and been smoking for 4 years..<br>  <br>  honestly its who you hangged out with<br>  im sure your friends always smoke weed and want to buy some am i right?/<br>  <br>  next time just say you have no money<br>  or go out and buy yourself something instead of the weed!!<br>  trust me the first 3 days its hard<br>  but after you keep saying no itll be sooo eassy!!<br>  <br>  and hey who said you have to totally quit<br>  maybe take a hit every now and then! ;)|`|iiRbOAQnaa	I quit cold turkey for a few drug tests... It wasn't hard for me at all but for you I would reccomend a substitute. When my friend quit he started running all the time to distract his mind, that was his substitute. You might want something physical though... try switching to fake weed ("bush"). It won't get you high, but it will satisfy the need to smoke with out getting you hooked on something really dangerous (i.e. cigarettes).|`|VrjHcSCuaa	just take you time <br>  <br>  you can always cut down and gradually stop <br>   <br>  if you stop straight away it can cause more stress so just try to slow it down <br>  <br>  i wish you the best of luck|`|ysUqQ9Qkaa	Just wean yourself off slowly.  Like skip a day and then two days and three days, whatever.  Plus I find it's easier to do things when you decide to do them less but not use the term quit.  If you say you're quiting it makes it very hard when you are tempted to do it again, but if you say you're cutting down it's pretty easy to acknowledge you don't need to do it then but might at sometime in the future.|`|yoS4cAszaa	I don't think it's physically addictive, definatly mentally tho.

I smoked every single day from the time I was 17 until last February. Which means I haven't smoked in one year. I honestly thought I would never quit smoking because I enjoyed it so much. In order to determine whether or not you're addicted, you need to ask yourself some questions.<br>  <br>  Do you experience any type of loss so that you can continue to smoke. Losing family, friends, relationships, etc...<br>  <br>  Do you spend money you don't have on weed? Are your bills overdue so you can continue to get high?<br>  <br>  Can you really not stop, or do you just don't want to? Are your thoughts preoccupied with getting high? Do you think about it all the time?<br>  <br>  If you answered yes to any of these, you may be addict, and if you truly are an addict, then the only sure way to stop is to get treatment.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're predisposed to alcoholism, there's a very good chance that you may be addicted to marijuana. I've read medical studies that say anywhere from 70-85% of people who are predisposed to alcoholism will become addicted to marijuana once they start smoking regularly. My dad was an alcoholic, so I thought I was addicted to pot too, but then I just decided to try and stop. I just decided to not buy any more, and I've had people offer to smoke with me many times since then, and have turned it down with no problems. I figured out I wasn't addicted because I stopped with no problems.<br>  <br>  Marijuana is a profound addiction for people who can become addicted. Most people with no history of alcoholism won't become addicted to it. That's why there are so many people who say it's not addictive. <br>  <br>  Also, there is no such thing as mental addiction and physical addiction. There's only addiction. You either can stop, or you can't.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|TGDZEk1Laa	I tried to quit and my downfall is the same i keep hanging out with people who smoke alot of weed, so that would be my suggestion for your first step.|`|AA10873763	I ran out of weed and money at the same time.|`|NactmHwqaa	I haven't quit smoking weed, but I stop 3-6 months at a time sometimes.<br>  <br>  Just quit cold turkey.

UL3XOKJxaa	If it is a specific tooth it is most likely NOT a sinus infection. Usually all the posterior maxillary teeth hurt on the affected side. If it is a sinus infection, you should have complete resolution of the problem in 10 days -2 weeks.

xQn3rR6Naa	You need to see a doctor and do it soon. This sounds like diabetes or hypoglycemia and as if you are having episodes of very low blood sugar. This can cause you to have seizures and even kill you if it goes on very long. The fact that you recover somewhat about 10 minutes after eating is another indicator that you are going low. Insulin is the hormone that acts like a key in a door. This key opens up the ability of the cells to allow sugar into the cells and to use what is available. If insulin isn't there or is overproduced and the body can't use it properly then problems arise. See your doctor right away. Call the receptionist and tell them your symptoms so they don't put you off for weeks.|`|ZNbauLJzaa	No, those symptoms don't sound like diabetes.

cc3de441467bd3591cbacd40337caeccaa	maybe it's not just your diet? look at your routine.<br>  <br>  allow 3-5 days rest between working the same muscle groups, it seems like a long time but that's the time the tissue is actually building and regrowing. and of course take in lots of protein and amino acids esp. right after workouts 25-40 grams. these are the building blocks of muscles, you have to get lots of these. the average person does not take in enough of either on a daily basis to support heavy muscle growth. 6 small meals a day 3 should be protein shakes. also try to do slow controlled reps, this is important! it adds intensity to your workout and makes for more efficient use of your time. oh god i could go on forever.<br>  <br>  everybody (with experience) has their own routine or strategy for the best way to build muscle. i suggest you do some research and figure out what works best for you. me personally, i love going to the gym and ripping my muscles to shreds, i rep to absolute failure. bring a friend and have him spot you doing things like curls so he can help you squeeeezzzee out those last 2 or 3 reps. you have to rip up your muscles and provide your body plenty of protein and rest to repair. if you work the same muscle groups every day or every other day you're just re-ripping them, not allowing them to grow and recover.<br>  <br>  a GREAT place to start your research is <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbinfo.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/bbinfo.h...</a> there's TONS of very useful articles here.<br>  <br>  one of the strange phenomenons in the gym is what i call the placebo effect... sorta... when you're repping and you cant squeez out that last one have your buddy just place his hands under the bar and make it look like he's helping you lift without actually lifting. somehow magically you can do 2 or 3 more reps with their "assistance"<br>  <br>  pick 2 muscle groups and and alternate between the two, going to failure on one should allow you enough time to work the other. then alternate. drink lots of water! and rest well.<br>  <br>  basically if ur trying to put on muscle weight u need protein to build the muscles and carbs to give you the energy to work out. take multivitamins!<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|wnDPlEjDaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  <br>  First of all generate diet plan for you.<br>  Then start work on this diet plan.<br>  Honey has been reported to have an inhibitory effect to around 60 species of bacteria across a wide spectrum!

Foreplay usually is fun for like 10 15 min, then you r just rail her brains out. good stuff
xj5IyeCuaa	okay well apparently you re not hitting her favorite "spots"<br>  why don't you ask her what she likes the best that you do to her? and then go from there.. or if your girl is into trying new things.. why not add a little excitement to it. like oral maybe or some sort of sex toys. one thing that my boyfriend does to me.. (this may get a little too much info) but you don't know me and i don't know you.. but one thing he does to always get me to orgasm is .. he will use a vibrator and go down on me and stimulate my clit at the same time.. that gets me EVERY TIME so.. that's a new technique you could try.. if your girl is up for it.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	Find her "G" spot with your finger....Then find the clit with the tongue....Works every time without disappointment.|`|uZQ9GDSlaa	Marry her. Make her comfortable. Tell her how beautiful she is. When you two hop in the sack, start talking about the things you really admire about her. But be sincere. Gently cradle her face in your hands and then kiss her. After that, it should pretty much take care of itself.|`|jDflHYOzaa	First off let me tell you that many girls don't orgasm through intercourse its usually oral...<br>  <br>  Oral- while you lick her cl*t finger her and ask her what she likes. Every girl is different. Try different positions with it. <br>  <br>  Intercourse- tell her to get on top. Tell her to grind her hips against you and let her control the speed and depth and she'll be more comfortable b.c. she gets to control everything and which she'll be able to let loose and enjoy herself. because we can control if we orgasm or not its a gift. and a lot of girls hold back so it could just be the girl not being comfortable with you hope it helps|`|dnRs3V2Aaa	Umm...lick her clits, finger her, oral is better btw.|`|203c0aa6d63de13b473f9a6478b9ecccaa	try harder
6nrLRKmeaa	It's a horribly painful (mentally. physically and emotionally) experience. You can't focus on anything important, it's sometimes hard to even walk or stand up, and for some women it can cause fainting. And you can't have sex, which is the worst part.

cdrAfzY9aa	Its a charley horse. It usually happens when muscles are fatigued they knot up. Did you feel your calf? Did if feel like a knot? If so this is definantly the problem. You can avoid them sometimes by making sure you drink enough water. If your potassium is low this can cause them also but when you get them (and almost everyone does) get up and walk it will feel like your calf is comming apart but very quickly it will go away. Cold compresses work also I sometimes get a bag of frozen veggi's out of the fridge and lay them on it works almost instantly.|`|PVwZVXo0aa	maybe cuz of ur period|`|o2WEoWp5aa	It could be almost anything, from a possible muscular disease to you just straining it. It could be you are not getting enough protein, which can cause that (I used to get that all the time b/c I'm a vegetarian). I would go talk to your doctor about it, because it could be something much more serious.

Also, there are pills available under the name of "AZO" that are basically cranberry pills, and designed specifically for aiding UTI's.  Also make sure you're drinking plenty of water (bottled, in your case)|`|JhJXKRkOaa	Make sure you drink loads and loads of water, that will help alot but you need to go to the doctors to get medication. you can't cure it by yourself.<br>  <br>  I haven't had a urinary tract infection before but I've had something similar, had a reoccurring kidney infection, was given medication and told to drink loads of water.|`|68edad4826bc75b2b9f39ed5a85d8cf5aa	Get antibiotics and keep hydrated.<br>   Cranberry juice is too acidic to drink when you have an infection.<br>  Use it when you are well.
1GtSrNqMaa	you need to see your doctor. it might not be anything, but you could have an infection or Toxic Shock Syndrome, which IS something to be concerned about.

Get to the doctor ASAP!|`|x5VxxH4taa	Go and see a doctor, tampons are only supposed to be left in for 8 hours max, maybe a little longer, but this is serious and nothing to mess around with.  It might be embarrassing, but you should go to your doctor ASAP, don't feel embarrassed they are here to help and see stuff even worse everyday.  Who knows there might not even be anything wrong but you really really should get it checked out... Play it safe.  Toxic Shock Syndrome can occur when a tampon is left in too long, its your body reacting to a foreign object...<br>  Good Luck|`|E2IaiCpyaa	See your doctor ASAP to avoid Toxic Shock Syndrome.  Read the label instructions that come with tampons.  Dark blood can be normal but the smell is not.  Do you have cramps?  A fever?

Several different varieties exist, inclduing Sativa and Indica. The physical qualities include tiny red/brown hairs and a white crystalline powder coating. Marijuana is usually grown, dried and then rolled and smoked or used in a pipe or bong. It can also be eaten; it is usually cooked and added to brownie or cookie mixtures. It is sold according to its dried weight in either ounces or grams. The price will vary depending on the quality, amount and/or your dealer.

It's commonly called "pot". It's a "mind altering" drug that is better left alone & NOT even tried to be "investigated".  It's illegal, & IF you're caught w/it on you, you WILL do jail time or pay a fine that I'm SURE you would NOT even be able to afford, therefore, you'd do jail time rather than NOT be able to afford for anyone to bail you out.  Just being found with paraphernalia that is used for pot could ALSO get you in BIG TIME TROUBLE.  So, don't trouble trouble unless trouble troubles you.  In other words, LEAVE IT ALONE!!!

05f135eb5c00c9813c91e82aba63e29caa	Go see a doctor, especially if your UTI has lasted more than a couple of days. How do you know if you have a UTI? Is your urine cloudy? Painful urination?

Go to the doctor you will feel better|`|xvZ2NcWeaa	first, never be afraid to seek medical attention. Urinary tract infections are pretty common events particularly in women due to the length of the urethra and it's proximity to the anus, the source of most of these infections. Yes, it is true that if caught very early, plain cranberry juice contains a property that makes it difficult for the bacteria that causes the infection to adhere to the bladder wall. Pyridium, the over the counter medication that causes your urine to turn orange, is not used to "cure" the infection but to reduce the discomfort and shouldn't be used for more than a few days as it may mask signs of the infection.<br>  Most infections can be found by a simple urine test and treated with oral antibiotics. Sometimes injectable antibiotics are prescribed and given in the emergency department or your providers office and a smaller group need to be hospitalized. Usually these individuals have waited too long and allowed the infection to migrate upward into the kidneys so if you are vomiting, have back/flank discomfort you should see a healthcare provider sooner than later. Good luck and be well.|`|PNrJS4OKaa	This worked for my friend, dunno if you want to try it tho.<br>  <br>  Drink a mix of 1 teaspoon of baking soda with 8 ounces of water.

AA12266052	Children who receive both behavioral treatment and medication often do the best. Medications should not be used just to make life easier for the parents or the school. There are now several different classes of ADHD medications that may be used alone or in combination. Psychostimulants are the primary drugs used to treat ADHD. Although these drugs stimulate the central nervous system, they have a calming effect on people with ADHD.<br>  These drugs include:<br>      * Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta, Metadate, Daytrana)<br>      * Dexmethylphenidate (Focalin)<br>      * Amphetamine-dextroamphetamine (Adderall)<br>      * Dextroamphetamine (Dexedrine, Dextrostat)<br>      * Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse)<br>  The FDA has approved the nonstimulant drug atomoxetine (Strattera) for use in ADHD.

You don't say when you had your last injection, but usually when your periods become regular again you should try to conceive.  If it doesn't happen after a year your doctor will probably run some hormone tests.  You need to be patient.  Hope this helps, and good luck.|`|gC98RlU3aa	when i was on it the doctor said it may take a few months, depending on how long u were on it for the homones to get back in sync and for ur cycle to begin again.
C05aHvwdaa	Pretty severe but there is a way to feel better,  Inversion therapy is the best treatment for back pain and sciatica that I know of.  In 04 I had to get back surgery for a herniated disc.  Nearly 2 years after surgery I STILL had painful and crippling sciatica, weak legs and pain.  A friend of mine turned me on to inversion therapy and I have been hanging upside down ever since.  what I've learned through treating with inversion therapy is that although we feel pain in  our backs, the pain really originates in the core, stomach or ab muscles.  As I inverted I felt my abs start to loosen as the spasms were stretched away.  As my abs relaxed they loosened their grip on my hip muscles, thighs and of course my back muscles.  Once these muscles were also relaxed my lower back and pelvis were free to go back into alignment and as they did my sciatica disappeared.  I have been virtually pain free for 3 years now because of inversion therapy and I want the world to know!  Inversion therapy has literally saved my life.  Do some research yourself and see if you think inversion therapy can help you as it did me.  All my best|`|D9fjiGnsaa	Have you googled this information yet? The answers are all in there.

I can stop smoking any time and stay stopped for years...but i'm a sucker for a cigarette in a bar in the summer time (don't ask I have no idea why). What works for cigarettes with me is just stopping completely. I "pretend" I am not a smoker and that everyone that smokes is sad for not finding the secret to being a non-smoker as I have (even if it's only for a day, you have to consider youself a non-smoker). And don't talk about cigarettes or smoking, don't watch people smoke. Pretend you have a nervous twitch instead. Like when you are driving, tap the steering wheel or sing. Realize you can do things without smoking. Actually everything is easier when you don't smoke. It might make you misearable and end up crying a few days into it, but stick with it, I did the first time I tried this years ago. And the other choice is something I do with cheese because I am like a cheese addict...if there is such a thing, lol. anyway, I tell myself I am allergic to it. And if anyone asks why I'm so anal retentive about cheese, I just say I'm allergic too. Even if they know I am not, it helps in some weird way that nothing else has ever worked for me before. Hope this helps!|`|oH5Vv9Fxaa	I quit cold turkey. To an extent. I chewed gum when I was craving a cigarette, just regular Orbit gum.

If you know that it's your vagina, try breathing slowly and relaxing, or sitting on the toilet seat and inserting it slowly until it slips in.

x3D2BUMEaa	No, you are not weird.  I was a victim of a rape too and I know that an orgasm is a mere physiological response to stimulation of the woman's erogenous zones during sex. An orgasm or sexual pleasure in general can occur in the victim of the assault despite the fact that she does not wish to engage in the sexual activity with the rapist. Many women that are raped will experience different levels of sexual responses such as nipple erection, vaginal lubrication, etc. and a significant percentage will experience an orgasm during the rape.<br>  <br>  I think that you would do yourself a big favor if you would discuss this aspect of the rape with your counselor.

5rJ6nf2oaa	You say you're anemic but not whether you are taking iron supplements or not. If you are then I have a diet change in mind for you that requires you to eliminate red meat for 8 weeks. Other things to eliminate are dairy, processed food and anything containing additives (this basically means most things that come in a can, bottle or packet). Replace all that with fresh fish/seafood (not fried), some lean chicken, lots of vegetables (raw is better), salads and fruit, wholemeal bread, pasta and rice. You can have soy products to replace the dairy. <br>  With this diet you are cleansing your liver and increasing its fat burning capacity and will lose weight, probably around 2lb per week. If you can walk for 30-40 min a day then this is all the exercise you need so don't do anything to upset your asthma.<br>  Read more about this process in the articles below, they include tips and example diet plan.

The problem your having is anorgasmia or anejaculation. Anejaculation is the inability to ejaculate semen despite stimulation of the penis during intercourse or by masturbation. This is a common problem and can contribute to significant stress in a couple trying to become pregnant. This condition may be stress induced and tend to occur only in some situations. It may be total, in which case the man is never able to ejaculate under any circumstance. Men who never ejaculate may also never have an orgasm. This is called ANORGASMIC ANEJACULATION.<br>  <br>  Some may experience an orgasm but do not ejaculate semen, either because there is failure of the semen to come out due to a block in the tubes or damage to the nerves or because the semen flows back into the bladder due to weakness of the bladder neck (retrograde ejaculation). Men who do not have an orgasm and do not ejaculate can be difficult to treat. If there is a history of a traumatic sexual episode in the past, this needs to be discussed with your doctor who will refer you to a sexologist or a psychologist.<br>  <br>  The use of a vibrator is the main treatment. This provides a strong stimulus to the penis for a long duration. This allows the man to reach an orgasm and ejaculate. This is successful in 60% of men. If the vibrator fails then electroejaculation can be performed. This involves direct electrical stimulation of the nerves to the penis. This requires general anaesthesia and is only used if repeated sessions with the vibrator fail.<br>  Men who have an orgasm but do not ejaculate usually have a physical problem and the treatment will depend on the type of problem. If the nerves are damaged then medicine may help. If this fails then vibrator stimulation or electroejaculation may help to obtain a sample of semen for fertilization. If there is a block in the tubes due to infection this can sometimes be cleared by surgery. If surgery is not successful then the sperms may be aspirated and used to fertilize the eggs by in-vitro fertilization thus achieving a successful pregnancy.<br>  Consult your family doctor who will refer you to a urologist for the necessary examination and evaluation.<br>  Best wishes.|`|AA11611714	U SHOULD BE ASKING A DR NOT YAHOO ANSWERS|`|a020ca380f51aec176fd4d4ceaadfd35aa	yes it is.... you have to take it out every once in a while to let it breathe....I might suggest driving girlfriend instead of said truck.... this may help the balls to get excercise....

P9XxUAjhaa	Seborrheic dermatitis is a disease that causes flaking of the skin. It usually affects the scalp. In adolescents and adults, it is commonly called "dandruff." In babies, it is known as "cradle cap." <br>  <br>  Seborrheic dermatitis can also affect the skin on other parts of the body, such as the face and chest, and the creases of the arms, legs and groin. Seborrheic dermatitis usually causes the skin to look a little greasy and scaly or flaky. <br>  <br>  The treatment of seborrheic dermatitis depends on its location on the body. Treatment also depends on the person's age. <br>  <br>  Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp (dandruff) in adults and adolescents. Dandruff is usually treated with a shampoo that contains salicylic acid (some brand names: X-Seb, Scalpicin), the prescription medicine selenium sulfide (brand names: Selsun, Exsel) or pyrithione zinc (some brand names: DHS Zinc, Head & Shoulders). These shampoos can be used 2 times a week. Shampoos with coal tar (some brand names: DHS Tar, Neutrogena T/Gel, Polytar) may be used 3 times a week. If you have dandruff, you might start by using one of these shampoos daily until your dandruff is controlled, and then use it 2 or 3 times a week. <br>  <br>  When you use a dandruff shampoo, rub the shampoo into your hair thoroughly and let it stay on your hair and scalp for at least 5 minutes before rinsing. This will give it time to work. <br>  <br>  If the shampoo alone doesn't help, your doctor might want you to use a prescription steroid lotion once or twice daily, in addition to the shampoo. <br>  <br>  Seborrheic dermatitis of the skin creases in adolescents and adults. Steroid lotions may be used in adolescents and adults. <br>  <br>  Seborrheic dermatitis of the scalp in babies is treated with products that are not as strong as those used in adults. You might start with a mild, nonmedicated baby shampoo. Brushing your baby's scalp with a soft brush, like a toothbrush, can help loosen scales or flakes. But be gentle when massaging or brushing your baby's scalp--a break in the skin makes it vulnerable to infection. If a nonmedicated shampoo doesn't work, talk to your doctor about switching to a shampoo that contains tar. Or your doctor may recommend a prescription shampoo that contains 2% ketoconazole (brand name: Nizoral). <br>  <br>  Seborrheic dermatitis of the skin creases in babies. Gentle steroid lotions or creams may be used to treat seborrheic dermatitis in the skin creases of babies.<br>  <br>  OR - at night time apply some olive oil to your scalp for several nights and avoid store available shampoos.  Try something like pureology shampoo and conditioner...

AA11113246	I will quote directly from the textbook "Total Fitness and Wellness," used in classrooms in college universities:<br>  <br>  "Do Diet Pills Really Work? - A number of over-the-counter diet pills are available on the market, and most of them contain caffeine and other mild stimulants...Unfortunately, none of these products has been scientifically shown to assist in achieving safe and permanent weight loss. One study of individuals using commercially available diet pills reported that fewer than 3% of users lost weight and retained this weight loss longer than 12 months."<br>  <br>  I know you have heard it many times before, but the best weight loss for your body is a rationed diet, and a combination of cardio and weight training during the week. The more muscle you have the more fat you will burn. If you are not losing weight, try to up the intensity slowly in your workout by increasing weights and do some more hills and go longer distances when running. Your body adapts to a daily routine of the same thing, and will not be physically worked out after a while of staying at the same pace and intensity. Also, be sure to drink a lot of water. It will help circulate your system and be able to secrete more unwanted substances, thus losing more fat. Your body will also think it's full more by drinking water, and you will have less of a need to consume calories, thus losing weight.<br>  I too am fighting this battle of losing weight, and so far everything I have told you I have been applying to myself for a whole month now, and hope to continue. Keep your chin up, don't waist money on pills that aren't guaranteed to help you. The only thing that can change yourself is you, and the good habits you make today. I suggest getting with a personal trainer and see what things you can do to reach your goals, then go out and reach them. I wish you the best of luck on your journey!

P9XxUAjhaa	Building muscle and gaining strength are two different goals.  You can build muscle (sculpted appearance) by lifting very light weights often.  <br>  <br>  A strength training program should have of at least 3 workouts per week that consist of one set of 12-15 reps for seven exercises.  You should have an exercise for each major muscle group: chest, back, shoulders, front of the upper arm (bicep), back of upper arm (tricep), thighs, and abdomen.<br>  <br>  The number of sets increases from one to two in the third week, and by the fifth week, you perform those two sets back to back.  Be sure to increase the weight slightly in the second set.  <br>  <br>  Weeks 5 & 6 you will decrease the number of reps but increase the weight.  <br>  <br>  This is a basic principal to follow.  Start with light weight and lots of reps and over the course of a few weeks, increase the weight and do less reps.  You should get to where you are doing 3 sets of every exercise and you should have about 3 different exercises for each muscle group.  <br>  <br>  You can not build strength (without hurting yourself) if you don't ease your body up to it.   It's no different than trying to make a fat person lose weight.  You don't throw them on the treadmill going 6 miles per hour for an hour.  You start them going 3 miles per hour for 10 minutes and build theit endurance up to a higher fitness level.  <br>  <br>  Hope that helps...|`|hTT8DhYfaa	eat a lot.. get a little fat, then turn it into muscle... go online to check out good workouts|`|D0oTAbi1aa	Since I started to work out I was looking for a good weight loss product (I only wanted something 100% natural).

You may notice a slight "pinching" feeling on one side or the other when you ovulate.  <br>  <br>  Your body will also have a clear watery discharge when it is cleansing itself.  This can happen at any time.  As long as the discharge is watery and a clear or light milky shade, and has NO odor to it, then it is normal.

4iaAfQQeaa	First thing, stressing about it just makes it worse, Cortazol a stress hormone makes you put on weight, its a survival mechanism your telling your body your going into battle soon. Weight loss is a slow gradual thing, if you do it quickly you can go the other way in the long run and become more fat! (it mucks up your metabolic processes) So about getting thin in a month looking from a health stand point, NO! However if you wanted to go down the UNHEALTHY WHICH ANY HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WOULD NOT RECOMMEND caffeine can do it and high doses but not conducive to sleep and a healthy heart!!!

You could simply spend an hour or 2 after work at the gym. It'll be probably tiring after a day at work, but worth it to look better on your big day.<br>  <br>  And I hate the word "dieting". You shouldn't need to "diet" if you do enough exercise. You usually can eat what you want in moderation if you do enough.<br>  <br>  Ignore all the "diets". Just eat good foods.

AA11429012	First of all if you want to lose wait the healthy way, slow is better. It stays off longer and your body doesn't go into shock from quick weight loss. Eating less will only slow you down further because your not getting proper nutrition and the good stuff that makes your body work. Excercise is good, but eat more smaller meals throughout the day and then excercise. that's better then one or two big meals and some excercise. You also could be losing inches. It helps not to be discourage if your waste is getting smaller. Your body is changing but not always with weight coming off. I know it helped me lose weight when i noticed that my waste was getting smaller even though the scale didn't go down as much that week. No fad diets.  No starvation tactics because your body will start to feed off itself and damage your health.<br>  <br>  A few of my tricks(weightloss is also mental):<br>  <br>  Use a smaller plate so with less food it still looks filled to the brim.<br>  <br>  Walk instead of driving<br>  <br>  take the stairs instead of elevators and escalators<br>  <br>  eat half of your normal meals if you know you over eat.<br>  <br>  wear jeans and not jogging pants or loose fitted clothes.  loose clothing gives you no sense of weight loss or weight gain.<br>  <br>  Go swimming...it's cool, fun, and gret cardiovascular work out<br>  <br>  Drink water, water , and more water!!<br>  Good Luck.|`|7e076a0be67ad9199649156f6917847caa	I don't know how long you have been riding every other day, but it might be time to either start riding every day or riding longer on every other day.<br>  <br>  Eating healthy is very important also! For 'snacks', instead of cookies, candy or chips, eat fresh fruits and veggies. If you are addicted to chips (like I am), go with dried fruit chips (Apple or Banana) or the baked whole grain chips (Sun Chips is my favorite). Cut down on the amount of bread and other carbs in your diet, but don't cut them out completely. If the weather permits, try taking a walk in the evenings. Power walking burns calories but doesn't cause shin splints (like jogging).<br>  <br>  Good luck with losing the weight. If you just can't seem to do it on your own, see  your doctor!|`|AA11883289	I used something called THINS.

Taking the first step is the hardest.  Please don't overdo it at first.  I don't know where you live, but where I live right now we are having a heat wave.  PLEASE be careful.  Keep hydrated.  Lots of water is the key.  I am just losing the last of my weight from my 2nd pregnancy (OMG!) It doesn't come off like when I was a teenager.  My doctor suggested to add fiber, and make certain substitutions (examples - white bread - whole wheat; white rice - brown rice, white pasta - whole grain pasta).  I think you get the idea.  I hope that helps.  Good luck.  You can do it.  No matter what you weigh, be happy with yourself.  You are an amazing person! :) Michele|`|eb262ec188a2bedf781b0d5ec16fcce7aa	This worked for me.

I am also 5' 8" and weigh 195 lbs. I used to weigh 220 lbs. The best way for you to lose weight is to do cardiovascular exercises and to drink lots of water everyday . I think we're supposed to be drinking 8 glasses of water per day. I have been drinking 1 gallon of water everyday for about 2 weeks and have seen good results. In order to lose weight, you also need to drop all the junkfood, especially sodas. In order to lose weight and keep it off, you need to weight train. Ever since I started weight training, I've only been losing weight and haven't gained any back. If weight training interests you, exrx.com is a good site for learning the right techniques of weight training. In order to get yourself to eat less, try cutting your rations of food in half, and don't eat too late at night. Drinking water should drop your apetite anyway.|`|AA11612867	Homeopathic Treatment for Excessive Fat and Weight :-<br>  PHYTOLACCA BERRY's Mother Tincture is perhaps the safest and sure fire way of loosing excessive fat around abdomen.

Avoid eating refined sugar. Fried foods and trans fats such as milk, milk products, margarine, shortening, and other hydrogenated vegetable oils should be eliminated. Foods containing healthy omega-3 oils such as ground flaxseeds and sardines should be increased. Some people find that chocolate, caffeine, carbonated beverages, iodized salt, shellfish, wheat and/or milk products aggravate acne. <br>  <br>  Regular bowel movements are important. Drink at least 8 glasses of day of water. Increase fiber intake. In addition to eating fresh vegetables and fruit, choose whole grains. Some people may benefit from a one- to four-week liver detox diet based on fresh vegetables and fruit.<br>  <br>  Vitamins & Nutritional Supplements<br>  <br>  Vitamin A--Vitamin A may help to reduce sebum production. However, high doses of vitamin A can carry a risk of decreased bone density, birth defects, headache, and muscle and joint pain. Like the modified vitamin A prescription drugs, vitamin A can cause birth defects. Sexually active women of childbearing age should not take more than 5,000 IU per day unless they are under the guidance of a professional and are using at least two reliable forms of birth control. Vitamin A supplementation may not be necessary if there is adequate intake of beta-carotene, vitamin E, and zinc, all necessary for vitamin A formation. Decreasing unhealthy fats such as margarine, hydrogenated oils, processed foods, and other sources of transfats can also improve absorption. <br>  <br>  <br>  Zinc--Zinc, especially in the form of zinc gluconate or zinc sulfate, can help prevent acne. Zinc helps heal blemishes, reduces inflammation, and reduces androgenic hormonal effects on the skin. Begin by increasing food sources of zinc. Two studies comparing zinc to the antibiotic tetracycline found zinc to be as effective as tetracycline. Another study found a mild yet definite effect of zinc.<br>  <br>  <br>  Vitamin B6--Vitamin B6 may help premenstrual or mid-cycle acne. This vitamin is essential for the proper metabolism of steroid hormones and can reduce the sensitivity of skin to the effects of testosterone. <br>  <br>  Herbs<br>  A herbal blend that can help with acne consists of equal parts of the herbal extracts of sarsaparilla, yellow dock, burdock, and cleavers. These herbs are believed to be potent blood and lymph cleansers. Half a teaspoon per day of this blend can be taken three times per day combined with a healthy diet.|`|yzZN2GQVaa	take little aloe vera gel with 3 drops of lemon juice n apply of acne for 15 mins.daily.

This is probably what is causing the twitch.  It's kind of similar to your leg falling asleep.  If the muscles are tensed up for too long, they will start reacting to it.  Stress also messes with your brain chemistry.

AA11883289	Stay away from pills and always read the fine print - exercising is always suggested ALONG WITH taking the product.  Surprise, surprise!<br>  The real secret is simply to consume less calories than you expend.  How you accomplish this is up to you - eat less or exercise more.<br>  For those of us who need that extra "dieting help", I used something called THINS to curb my cravings.

056a5234dab4b2de49a6b2bfc9d45781aa	Yep.  By the way, Collodial Minerals once suffered the same demise.  There's a few other companies you'll soon see on the "chopping block" - one's that make similiar, unfounded claims (e.g. Noni, Xango, etc.).  Bottom line?  Stay with only qualitative, third-party research that conclusively depicts product efficacy (e.g. PreventionProof.com, which I think has something like 23 studies).|`|d3fc88abdf780230f4ff7918a78ae7e8aa	Wow, thanks for the link.  www.PreventionProof.com  has some excellent resources, medical abstracts and audio files.

64962c88133800ec6eeb9e470322bc00aa	yea you would deffinantly need 2 keep using it. i used 2 have it it never really worked for me but i was never really faithful about using it. im sure if u kept it up it would work well tho. good luck|`|tMMxK65taa	The acne will probably come back. You have to keep doing it every day and make it routine.|`|P9XxUAjhaa	I beleive that Proactive is supposed to become part of your daily routine.  So even after the acne is gone, you continue to use the cleanser which should prevent breakouts.  I personally broke out worse from it.  My skin is too sensitive for the benzoyl peroxide.  What has worked best for me is products with glycolic and salacylic acids...|`|AM4gYbmUaa	It would come back|`|hzdEueQ5aa	i use proactiv, its works pretty good but keep using it so the acne wont come back, u can probably miss like one day, but not too many!!|`|sOC0WMU1aa	I have been using Proactive steadily now for about 3 months. I had used it years ago, but didn't stick with it. I tried a multitude of prescription medications short of Accutane but to no avail.<br>  <br>  My advice to you would be to stick with it. Proactive is not a cure. It's just a daily treatment and you have to continue if you want to keep seeing results. <br>  <br>  Also, another tip ( if you wear make-up ) : QUIT using makeup-foundation sponges. THEY MAKE YOU BREAK OUT. Start using foundation brushes and wash them every few days. Trust me, I have never had clearer skin, and it's a combination of my new foundation brush and regular use of ProActive. Any large cosmetic company like Prescriptives, or Clinique sells good ones. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.
LEvJLcsFaa	Fumar es malo, lo sabemos todos. Estoy segura que nadie quiere realmente fumar sino que lo hacen por esetar enganchados a una droga. Recomendarias a alguien que fumara, o animarias a tu hijo a que fumara. Desde luego que no . LA gente que fumar lo hace por que esta enganchado y no consiguen o no se atreven a intentar dejarlo.

Drink lots of water, no spicy foods, cranberry juice, try to keep upset at bay.<br>  <br>  When I miscarried, I started spotting almost brown.

I went home to try to pass on my own, but didn't (ended up w/ D&C operation).<br>  <br>  You are most likely not pregnant-female organs aren't that high.  Your intestines go everywhere, so that could be it too.  I'd just wear a pad to let it flow out (not backing up) just in case, but try Ibuprofren (helped with my internal pains) and Tums/Rolaids.

9e34e4a4e2d6fd652889125af0c5ed3faa	Yes you could get a lip piercing but you should consider that getting one puts you at risk of causing permanent gum recession. The back or ball of the lip earing constantly rubs against the gums of the front teeth and cause the gum to recede once the gum is gone it dose not grow back. Because the gum is now receeded the tooth appears longer and the root is now exposed because it is no longer covered by the gum. This root exposure can cause alot of sensitivity. Because the gum is now gone in that area that tooth has now lost some of its support and that puts that tooth at risk for tooth loss later on. The only way to correct a receeded gum is to have a gum graft surgery, this is when they take tissue from another area of your mouth and place it to the area where the gum tissue is missing. So you have to ask yourself is a lip earing worth all this? I have seen many young people come in with lip earings and they have lost alot of their gum and they were not even aware, now that you are dont make the same mistake...go for a nose earing instead.|`|90abf5cd58f6aa0a8da8d5e6a6dedeaaaa	i would think it would get stuck and hurt like the dickens when it did.|`|b710a90f9863d61f93d8daa4734326feaa	Don't pierce your lip.

Can you put your finger in a light socket with braces?  Neither is a good choice.|`|AA10024301	As a dentist, I will tell you that is a bad idea.  Lip piercing is generally a bad idea due to possible infection and damage the gums from the lip ring.  But with braces, you also have the risk of the lip ring getting caught with the wire or brackets, which could bend the wire or loosen a bracket.

EXLdX3e3aa	Carbon monoxide is toxic to humans, and we are normally protected to a degree by circulating antioxidants such as glutathione.<br>  <br>  In general, antioxidants are chemicals that circulate in the body and scavenge for harmful free-radical species, and neutralize them, thereby protecting tissues from damage that might occur otherwise.|`|ZpZNtLKbaa	for starters carbon monoxide has nothing to do with anti-oxidents.  Oxidation in the body is the cause of EVERY major disease or illness.  So to find a powerfull anti-oxident and add it to your daily routine is nothing but great for your body.  One of the most potent natural anti-oxidents are a class of molucules called Xanthones.  Now just over 200 xanthones are found in nature..  of which 40 are in one fruit called the mangosteen. <br>  <br>  Xanthones inhibit the oxidation of low-density lipoproteins (LDL), the good fat, helping to eliminate the danger of stroke and other heart diseases. Although oxidation commonly occurs in nature, such as producing rusted metal or the browning of fruit, it also leads to the breaking down of proper bodily functions. Each day approximately 70 trillion cells in humans receive 10,000 hits from toxins or free radicals in the environment. Xanthones are powerful free radical scavengers; strong antioxidants with the gift of an extra electron. In a hefty portion, like those found in the Mangosteen fruit, Xanthones eliminate free radical toxins by bonding with the toxin's missing electron. <br>  <br>  Lifestyle diseases, including stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's, arthritis, stress, and diseases of the heart, liver and kidney, share the common denominator of having inflamed cells caused by oxidized toxins. New research findings reveal that chronic inflammation severely damages the immune, musculosketal, neurological, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems. Inflammation, our body's natural warning signal and defense mechanism, can go out of control, causing increased body pain and affecting brain functioning. Inflammation caused by high amounts of ammonia in the brain cells has been linked to Alzheimer's disease by many research scientists, however when the liver functions properly, ammonia molecules cannot build up in the brain tissues. <br>  <br>  Allopathic anti-inflammatory drugs slow down inflammation by inhibiting what are known as Cox-2 enzymes. Unfortunately, these pharmaceutical approaches wipe out the necessary Cox 1 enz ymes essential for production of prostaglandins-1 that protect the GI track and delicate blood platelets. Xanthones selectively block Cox 2 leaving the Cox-1 enzymes intact, producing no known side effects. Xanthones have shown to block Protease-1 which the AIDS virus needs in order to replicate.<br>  <br>  Xanthone-rich plants grown in the southern hemisphere, such as Mangosteen, are becoming increasingly known to mainstream science in the northern hemisphere. Just as the study of Vitamins C and E and Aloe Vera was once early science, research and mounting empirical evidence on Xanthones are further opening our awareness to the simplicity and power of food as medicine. Xanthones have been proven to assist our bodies in healing sickness and preventing disease.<br>  <br>  so if your looking for a great mangosteen based supplement... I have the answer for you

Besides, that much in a week would probably be water weight, which comes right back.<br>  <br>  Try taking a walk for 30 minutes a day, adding 10 minutes each week. Once you get up to an hour long walk, start biking or running for 20 minutes a day, adding on minutes once again. By the time you are biking for an hour a day, just keep at it and you'll keep losing.<br>  <br>  Remember to EAT YOUR BREAKFAST. Eating Breakfast will reduce your hunger and increase your energy throughtout the day. You should have a large breakfast, smaller lunch, and light dinner. Or you can have multiple small meals throughout the day. Avoid snacking at night, and when you really want junk food, eat a half serving and substitute the other half with a fruit or veggie. Make sure you drink water too, it's helpful in losing weight faster. Be sure to lay off soda...it's high in cals.<br>  <br>  That's how I lost 80 pounds of fat and gained 20 pounds of muscle, myself. It has been really easy to mantain my weight now, too.<br>  <br>  This isn't the fastest thing out there (it has you lose 2 or 3 pounds a week), but it is VERY safe this way.<br>  <br>  Best of luck!|`|1b41331da1c77e849a5352b56d9e3f4eaa	Healthy weight loss tips<br>  <br>  <br>      * Take one pound at a time<br>  <br>        Don’t get overwhelmed by how much weight you need to lose. Try to remember that "losing 15 pounds in two weeks" is nothing to celebrate. It is important to realize that the more quickly weight is lost, the more likely the loss is coming from water and muscle, not fat.<br>  <br>        Since muscle tissue is critical in keeping our metabolism elevated, losing it actually leads to a decrease in the amount of calories we can each day without gaining weight.<br>  <br>        Fat loss is best achieved when weight is lost slowly. Strive for a weight loss of no more than 3-4 pounds per week. One pound of weight is equivalent to 3500 calories.<br>  <br>  <br>      * Set Reachable Goals<br>        For instance, if you know you need to get more exercise, begin with a manageable goal of, say, walking 10 minutes a day that you know you can achieve. Then build your self-esteem by achieving the small goals you set yourself.<br>  <br>        The same logic applies for losing weight.<br>  <br>      * Stay off the scales<br>        Don’t get discouraged when your progress seems to be slow according to your bathroom scales. They do not provide a true measure of what is going on with the body.<br>  <br>        If exercise levels are adequate (5-7 days a week), you may be putting on muscle but losing fat, thus losing inches even if you are not losing pounds. It's always a good idea to do several body measurements to have a second objective way to monitor progress.<br>  <br>  <br>      * Stay focused on being healthy, not thin<br>        Many people become more successful at long term weight loss when their motive changes from wanting to be thinner to wanting to be healthier. Change your mindset to think about selecting foods that will help your body's health rather than worrying about foods that will affect your body's weight. The Food Pyramid offers a basic outline of the types and amounts of food you should eat each day to give your body the nutrients it needs for optimal health.<br>  <br>      * Fat Free?<br>        We've known for some time that limiting high fat foods in the diet can be helpful with weight loss. That's because fats pack in 9 calories per gram compared to only 4 calories per gram from proteins or carbohydrates. To many, the message to limit fats implied an endorsement to eat unlimited amounts of fat-free products. Just to clarify, fat-free foods have calories too. In some cases fat-free foods have as many calories as their fat laden counterparts. If you eat more calories than your body uses, you will gain weight. Eating less fat will help you to lose weight. Eating less fat and replacing it with excessive amounts of fat-free products will not.<br>  <br>      * Drink plenty of water<br>        Drink eight glasses a day. Water is a natural appetite-suppressant. Nettle tea is a great weight-loss tea as it supports metabolism and has diuretic properties.<br>  <br>      * Reward yourself<br>        Each time you reach a goal, such as losing 5 pounds, reward yourself with a gift or a massage.<br>  <br>      * Seek help if you need it<br>        A big key in long term weight control comes from receiving encouragement and support from others. Find a friend to lose weight with or you can check to see if groups such as Weight Watchers, or eDiets offer programs and resources in your area by clicking the links. You may also wish to check with your local hospital to see if their registered dietician conducts group weight loss programs.<br>  <br>      * Watch your portions<br>        With the advent of "supersize" meals and increasingly huge portions at restaurants, our concept of normal serving sizes is a distant memory. Be mindful of the amounts of food you consume at a sitting. When necessary, divide your food in half and ask for a take home bag. It is all too easy to be a "plate cleaner" even when served enormous portions. Learn to pay attention to your hunger level and stop eating when you feel comfortably full, not stuffed.<br>  <br>      * Eat your food slowly<br>        Did you ever notice that thin people take an awfully long time to eat their food? Eating slowly is one method that can help take off pounds. That's because from the time you begin eating it takes the brain 20 minutes to start signaling feelings of fullness. Fast eaters often eat beyond their true level of fullness before the 20 minute signal has had a chance to set in. The amount of calories consumed before you begin to feel full can vary significantly depending on how quickly you eat. So slow down, take smaller bites and enjoy your food.|`|AA11883289	I used something called THINS. It's a natural appetite suppresant (no stimulants, etc.)  I lost about 7 pounds a week.  Not the healthiest approach, I know, but I was impatient and wanted to see quick results. You can get it from PreventionProof.com.  While there is a plethora of products available for losing weight, I was particulary impressed with the fact that the research behind their products was very credible (Baylor College of Medicine, Georgetown University, American College of Cardiology, etc.) ...and not from some doctor who is "on the payroll".  ;-))<br>  Good luck!<br>  apuzyr@yahoo|`|020ebc7742979a32c4bb1f7d3541b85daa	The surest way to lose weight is to calculate how much you have to eat in relation to how much energy you expend. The more you are active, the more calories you will burn or use up. If you eat fewer calories than you use, you will lose weight. If you eat more calories than you use, you will gain weight.<br>  Start an exercise program. You will feel great, and will not need to think about food so much.<br>  When you do eat, do not leave the table stuffed. It is just fine to still feel slightly hungry.<br>  Try to focus on other things in life than on food. <br>  Some tricks to make your body feel that you have eaten a lot when you really have not:<br>  drink a lot of water<br>  chew sugarless gum<br>  eat slowly, and avoid sugar.<br>  Avoid as many processed foods as possible, such as pastas and prepared foods<br>  Eat as many fresh fruits and vegetables as you can<br>  Avoid high fat cheeses and meats<br>  Eat soy products and low fat dairy products<br>  Good luck.

This is a healthy rate and anything more will put your body into a starvation mode. Starvation mode is when your body goes into a type of shock if you will and puts most anything you consume into fat deposits.

The muscle looks leaner but weighs more than fat and that's why you put on weight. To burn fat, don't lift weights (adds muscle); just do cardio (treadmill, stairmaster, elliptical, etc) for 30-50 mins at a steady pace. <br>  <br>  If you are not eating and you go to the gym that much, it's definitely bad for your health. <br>  <br>  Your fat if you're a girl (this sucks) comes off your boobs first and your hips last. <br>  <br>  The only way to actually lose the fat is to eat. You need at least 1500 calories a day or else your body will slow your metabolism and store as much fat as it can (fat gets broken down last). Don't go for more than 4 hours without food, and don't eat late at night. <br>  <br>  Okay that's all I know.|`|AA10133147	The spots that seem to collect the fat first, is the place it comes off first.

But in reality the first time those things get put on, and anytime they adjust them after, your teeth/gum sensitivity will be quite painful.  You won't be able to chew anything properly for the first few days after because your mouth will be adjusting to the new or changed wiring.  Also, you will overtime get scratches or sores from the braces rubbing on the inside of your cheeks.

t8Qn3sfMaa	An uncle I was very close to died suddenly & tragically 5 years ago, and I fell into a deep depression. It took me a while, but I came through it a stonger person. The main thing that helped was for me to not bottle things up; to talk to people about it: He who hides his illness cannot hope to be cured. It sounds like you've got that one friend who you could spend some one-on-one time with. Also, talk to other family members about the loss. Some of them might blow you off, because they themselves don't want to talk about it, but you will find someone who is still feeling the pain. Different people heal in different ways at different rates; don't be hard on yourself for moving at your own pace.|`|5gG2OfHIaa	The reaction to the death of a family member is marked by a short period of expression of grief.  Then, in short order,  the emotion turns to an inexplicable anger toward the deceased family member.  From personal experience, I can state that this is a "normal" reaction to a landmark death in your life.  My speculation that the death in your family has had the effect of making you more reflective which would explain your diminished interest in a large circle of friends or acquaintances.  This is controversial advice; but, I would counsel against seeking talk therapy services.  In my view, this therapy is the equivalent of "renting a friend."  If your general function is impaired, in YOUR opinion,  then you may seek a mild anti-depressant from a qualified medical expert.  Not a psychologist or psychiatric social worker.  It is impossible to comment on your core friendships.  One bit of practical advice:  time is a cure for a loss of a family member or loved one.  The practical reality is that  you make it through each important holiday and family birthdays during the first year.  Having experienced those special family events proves to your mind that you can repeat the celebration or grief during the following years.

AS a consequence, brains, like anything else can be overexcited. LSD also effects concentrations of the excitatory neurotransmitter Glutamate, which is neurotoxic. Therefore, LSD, the more you take, the more it will literally kill brain cells. However limited recreational use is unlikely to direct cause lasting damage. Another effect would be exacerbating pre-existing mood disorders in susceptible individuals. Those who deal with addictions or delusions or psychosis are likely to find that LSD not only can make their conditions worse tempprarily, but in high enough doses and with prolonged use, can permanently make mental illness more severe.

Yet I've weighed between 103 to 112 pounds depending on my muscle size at the moment (I lift weights regularly and do cardio consistently along w/ a healthy diet). Muscle weighs more than fat so a scale is not always accurate. Go by how your clothes fit or by measuring your waist/hips inches. <br>  <br>  At 14, just be careful about what fast foods you consume and work out regularly. 121 is a healty weight. 108 is on the smaller side of 5'4" but it is still within healthty guidelines.

A website that explains this formula in more detail and will help you determine how many calories you need to reach or maintain a certain weight is at <a href="http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/library/weight/calsburned.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.primusweb.com/fitnesspartner/...</a><br>  <br>  Get a diet and fitness calculator that you can put on your computer or cell phone.

If you burn through exercise 500 more calories per day for a week you will lose one pound. <br>  <br>  *2) Eat natural and organic foods found on earth versus something created by a corporation to make money. Eat meals in small portions throughout the day and take a good multi-vitamin supplement. <br>  <br>  Avoid “High Glycemic Load Carbs” (sugar, pastries, desserts, refined starches such as breads, pasta, refined grains like white rice; high starch vegetables such as potatoes) and drink lots of water.

AA11883289	I’ve helped a number of clients lose weight.  Here are a few pointers I’ve compiled:<br>  <br>  * The key to weight loss is a very simple formula: burn more calories than you consume. It does not matter if you are eating hamburgers, brownies or carrot sticks; if you eat an excessive amount of food/calories, the excess will be turned to fat within hours.  The strategy is to restrict food intake, increasing exercise or both.  Obviously, the latter will accelerate the process.  Once again, it doesn’t not matter whether it's Weight Watchers, Atkins, South Beach Diet or whatever, the formula is the same.  The "fine print" of success, however, is the ability to adhere to a specific plan over a long period of time (i.e. keep the weight off). <br>  <br>  * Generally speaking, it does not matter if it takes you 7 minutes to run a mile or 15 minutes to walk it; the calories expended will be about the same.<br>  <br>  * One of the problems with going on a very rigid diet with a specific goal, is that it's usually a "quick fix" - the dieter attempts to gain a temporary solution to what is typically a chronic problem.  Often, the dieter tries to rigidly restrict eating by, for example, skipping meals or eating salads all day.  But trying not to eat is like trying not to breathe.  After a while, the body and mind rebel and, like a person gasping for air, the dieter loses control and binges.  As a result of the binge, the person feels that he has failed, gives up the diet altogether, eats more to make himself feel better, puts on some weight, feels even worse, gains even more weight, decides to try another restrictive diet, and begins the whole cycle all over again.<br>  <br>  * What is often overlooked, forgotten or dismissed, is that exercise is an essential part of any weight loss plan.  As long as you keep your body conditioned, with a shift of body composition [more] towards lean tissue instead of fat, your metabolism will increase permanently.  The more muscle and lean tissue you have, the more fat you will burn – all day long, even while you are resting.<br>  <br>  * The 10-calorie rule will enable you to lose a pound or two a week while supporting your basal metabolism (internal organ function, nervous system, etc.).  The rule is to allow 10 calories a day for each pound of your present body weight.  As you lose weight, you can gradually adjust calories downward to keep losing at this rate.  Thus, a person who starts at 220 pounds should eat 2,200 calories a day at first.  If your target weight is 180, then slowly reduce your calories to 1,800 a day. <br>  Another more aggressive approach is to institute a deficit of 500 calories a day for seven days (3,500 calories a week). Generally speaking, 3,500 calories equals one pound of body fat.  <br>  <br>  * Excess fat in the abdomen (e.g. men) is a much greater health risk than excess fat around the hips and thighs (e.g. women). The extra abdominal fat crowds the abdominal organs and the proximity to the liver means that, when metabolized, abdominal fat can raise blood cholesterol levels and lower the body's sensitivity to insulin.  Obviously, this sets the stage for diabetes.  Furthermore, the risk for disease rises significantly with a waist circumference of over 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women. <br>  <br>  * Despite what all the infomercials try and sell, there is no such thing as "spot reducing" (aka: losing fat in a particular location).  The fact is, muscles do not "own" the fat which surrounds them.  Since all body fat is shared by all the muscles and organs, spot reducing exercises that work only the flabby areas will not help to reduce the fat in that location.  However, tightening the muscles in trouble spots, through a more-complete exercise program, may improve the appearance of these areas…especially as time progresses.<br>  <br>  * Many dieters experience a temporary plateau after about 3 weeks; some may even notice a slight weight gain.  This is because they have gained water weight temporarily while they are still losing body fat.  The fat they are hoping to lose must be used for energy, which requires (among other elements) water to do this.  Once the water leaves the cells, it enters the blood, then the kidneys and finally into the bladder for excretion.  The signal that the plateau is over is frequent urination.<br>  <br>  Andy P; Certified Nutritionist<br>  @ PreventionProof.com|`|mzIOgLzpaa	significant weight loss fast = unhealthy, plus...most likely it's going to send you into a "yoyo" & you'll gain it all back plus possibly more.|`|4cd2c7649e1949de04b5f7bdd1c51814aa	Trust me, you never want to lose weight fast. The two best ways to sensibly lose weight  & keep it off, are via Weight Watchers & the Atkin's Diet plan. Many doctors are advising their patients to try one or the other of these plans. I personally  lost weight on the Atkin's plan & have kept it off. I am never hungry. Many diabetics do well on the Atkin's plan as well. Educate yourself on both of these diets. I bought Dr. Atkin's Diet Revolution paperback book, read just enough of it to get started on Phase # 1 & read up on the other  three phases as I was ready to embark on them. I was determined to lose, once & for all, & keep it off. I lost 130 lbs. in all & feel & look like a whole new person.

The last condition is totally treatable and isn't life threatening by any means... I know cuz I have it.  You'll need to see a dr. and get a Professional diagnosis, and to get some antibiotics.  They may also take xrays to be sure.  Try some nasal sprays like Afrin 12 hr. but be careful to use it for only a few days as it can become addicting, in the sense that your able to actually breathe, not chemically in anyway.

AA10163111	I am in recovery for anorexia nervosa/ bulimia nervosa, and have been for a month now.  I'm around 5'6" and weigh around 85 pounds.......in order to be classified as anorexic, you need to have a BMI of less than 18, have missed 3 or more consecutive mentrual periods, and an intense fear of eating/gaining weight.  (Those are just a few of the requirements)  Bulimia is another story, where purging (vomiting and taking laxatives) takes place.  There is also a disorder called EDNOS (Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified)  This classification is reserved for people who don't fit into the "anorexic" or "bulimic" or "binge eating" categories.  EDNOS patients often are a healthy (or just slightly underweight) weight, and often eat healthy meals, but have an intense fear of gaining weight, etc.  At this point, I'd place you in the EDNOS group, and you need to talk to a doctor.  Any sort of an eating disorder is nothing to fool around with, and I hope that you are able to get the help you need quickly.  Don't risk a heart attack like I did.  Recovery is hard, and takes time, but ultimately, it's worth it.  Good luck, and feel free to contact me privately for support if you need it.|`|00a29dad4912d7fdcb306d3acbcfc9e4aa	You should talk to a doctor.  You don't want to get misdiagnosed by someone online who might tell you the wrong thing.  Eating disorders are nothing to mess with.|`|AA10860112	its all in your head..<br>  change your way of thinking....<br>  don't do the what you normally do...<br>  do the opposite..... no about the anorexia....|`|AA11472749	If you think you have a problem you probably do and the time to get help is before you do damage to your body.  At 5'2 and weighing 110 to 115 this sounds perfectly normal, however, the fact that you are eating so little each day and eating unhealthy foods when you eat is not normal. <br>  <br>  Your body is probably in a starvation mode.  Are you not eating because when you eat a normal amount you immediately gain weight?  If so, then it's going to take your body a while to figure out that it's going to be fed on a regular basis and it doesn't need to hoard everything. <br>  <br>  Can you make yourself eat?  Six very small meals a day would probably be better for you than 3 normal meals.  Ensure would provide your body with some very needed nutrition. <br>  <br>  If you can't take charge and make yourself eat then you do need to get medical attention/intervention.|`|c0f46f82e2e9e94b7f54e6854e7c8b90aa	We would need more information to be able to tell. But if all you're eating is a pop tart a day then that's a problem. Are you not eating because you think you're fat or because you don't have time? You are definitely not underweight, but you should nip this in the bud now. <br>  <br>  It might be good to talk to someone or go to a support group before you get underweight and it spirals out of control. Trust me it's not fun. I'm 5'4 and recovering anorexic, at my lowest I was around 90 pounds. Everyone made fun of me because I looked HORRIBLE and I also had a heart attack, a stroke and a ton of other problems before I was 25. Anyway, I know this info prob wont' make you eat healthy, that's why you need to talk to a professional NOW. I wish I had right when my symptoms appeared. Anyway, good luck sweetie.|`|68233d8e03f14c3ad8e11d95fe748d3aaa	If you never eat and/or limit your calories, yes, that would be anorexia.  I think you are at a normal weight for your height, but you need to talk to your parents, school nurse or doctor.  You have to eat so your body has energy to get through the day.|`|91f9d850b87e7ecc692d77048ef3fc1faa	I'M NOT SURE THAT ANOREXIA IS THE PROPER WORD BUT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION IF YOU DO NOT TALK WITH SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP YOU WORK OUT THE ISSUES YOU HAVE WITH NOT EATING. IF YOU WERE ANEREXIC YOU WOULD BE THROWING UP WHAT YOU DO EAT. I AM GLAD THAT YOU ARE AWARE ENOUGH NOW TO KNOW THAT YOU ARE EXPERIENCING A REAL HEALTH PROBLEM.|`|a1410d51308a8c9ff4170b9842b2b14faa	Maybe you have an eating disorder if you don't eat when you're hungry, but if not then, no. I think maybe you should eat a bit more though, I remember when I went on a carb diet and it took some words from my mum to get me off.|`|afea6ebd8e171fccf99e668ba3c268d9aa	hey girl, you're still a growing kid. don't stop eating alright. its okay to eat complete meals just not too much. small amounts every 2-4 hours is fine. poptart isn't healthy though its a soure of energy since it contains starch/sugar. don't skip meals, it makes your metabolism slower and can make you have ulcers. most ladies have their side of insecurities and we just need to you know stop being that way and be contented (which is soooo hard to do!). don't wait til you have anorexia but i think you are starting to be one... Be healthy.|`|c1cdb0d85b4d4e65dc07007c4e1cd7fbaa	You are still within a healthy weight range, so you would not be classified as having an eating disorder.  I would be more concerned if you said every once in awhile you tend to binge eat, exercise excessively, or routinely purge.  You're a teenager (I assume, from your statement about eating lunch at school), so being insecure and thinking your fat is part of the trials of adolescence.  Your body is changing FAST and that can really throw you for a loop emotionally!<br>  <br>  Keeping that in mind, a starvation diet is NOT a diet!  If you don't eat regularly, your body thinks its starving.  What happens when you finally do eat is your body stores it all as fat b/c it knows it's going to be awhile before it gets food again.  Also, your age does come into play here--your body is still developing and nutrition is VERY important!  If your school has a wellness center or something of the like, I'd go to them and get some ideas on how you can 1) improve your self-esteem and 2) maintain a healthy weight w/o starving yourself!|`|f1e18b1c8665106476c2f299856ddaa3aa	first of all eat something no matter how little...your body...especially that small needs something to break down and give you enery. eventually if your not eating your gonna crash...put something in that tiny body<br>  <br>  try putting peanut butter on things...its good, gives you energy|`|0817655303781d1a57a4800a31dc038aaa	A poptart for dinner?  You couldn't eat anything worse if you tried. <br>  <br>  You need to get counseling before you get thinner.  Believe me, being too thin is not going to make your self-esteem any better.  It will make it worse.  She how you feel now?  Your weight is a little on the thin side, but not dangerously thin.  But it will get worse unless you get help.  Do you see girls who are really happy because they are thin?  Well, guess what?  They aren't happy either.  They are insecure and miserable.  If they seem happy to you--it's an act.  They hate themselves and just keep doing it thinking that if they could just lose a few more pounds then they would finally be happy.  They keep losing and they get more miserable.  Any girl who smiles and says they only eat a poptart or a glass of water and a raisin (you get my point) and you think that is how you want to be.......you DON'T.
9f5f940230e3ce293e5bbcf8eb05dcdbaa	Yes, it can for many reasons. On a physical level, a poor diet low in nutrients (esp. iron) will cause your brain to absorb the "happy" hormone serotonin more quickly which in turn causes your moments of happiness to be fleeting with predominate feelings of hopelessness. If you are eating a balanced diet your body performs as efficiently as it can which in turn makes the equilibrium of hormones in the brain as stable as they can be and ultimately eliminates any feelings of lethargy and low motivation. In an emotional and practical sense, when you're lethargic and unmotivated and depressed, you are most likely very inactive and may have excess body weight which causes you more stress and makes your more unhappy with yourself. the best thing you can do is drink 6 cups of water a day and eat a balanced diet or at least start taking multivitamins. this will eliminate any depression caused by overeating and lack of valuable nutrients. also, drinking more water gives you more energy b/c water is vital to your body. There are also studies which have shown that a brisk 30 minutes walk may ease depression and exercise is the body's natural way of fighting depression. If the depression persists after you develop a healthy diet and exercise routine, it may be time to seek professional help in the way of cognitive behavioral therapy (which increases ones mood by offering a more optimistic view of the world) along with an antidepressant with your doctor's permission. good luck.|`|0e30b69fa44e66840eab9a9bab72613aaa	yes, it can worsen. eat the right foods like fruits and vegies and eat a healthy breakfast. oh, yah take your vitamins....|`|55b18c5a4c60f1c4f26db4e16cc4850daa	Yes. A poor diet can worsen depression.  Eating foods that are unhealthy will cause you body to be weaker and you will be unable to function as well.  Too much sugar or caffeine will make  you terribly tired which with depression you already feel.  Without the correct intake intake of nutrients you will not be able to do much of anything because you will have even less energy than you would if you were depressed alone|`|AA11284771	YES YES YES.<br>  <br>  Most depression is treated with drugs.  Drugs are chemical that change how your body functions.  <br>  <br>  Food is made up of lots of chemicals that turn into hormones, neurotransmitters, etc.<br>  <br>  If drugs are chemicals, and foods are chemicals, and chemical change how we feel and function, then food changes how we feel and function.<br>  <br>  You feel happy when you eat delicious food, and miserable when you eat nasty food.  Long term poor diets give you poor chemicals for hormone and neurotransmitter development.  If you eat crappy, you feel crappy, you think crappy.<br>  <br>  Just my opinion, clinical observation, and overall general belief.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|AA11451360	Absolutely! You need fresh fruits, veggies, some fats in your diet. If you eat fast food all the time your body is not getting the nutrients it needs. Drink more water, have a salad, some oatmeal, stay away from fatty foods.|`|c2ba5a2561559b62f5b4f66ba993e924aa	Yes. That old saying "You are what you eat" is true. You need to try eating foods that are rich in nutrients that you need, not foods like pizza or candy that lift you up for a bit but don't have any redeeming factors in health. <br>  Fruits and veggies are good because they boost the good systems in your body which will, in turn, effect your moods.|`|caba0833643f2afa1a64bd4b6256e113aa	Eating healthy will help you feel physically better-working out can give you a high as well.  I too struggle with depression-not so much anymore, but I still get small bouts of it.  I have found that the only thing that truly helps is Jesus Christ.  I'm no fanatic-I'm into science and such, but it has been proven time and time again within my own life and I'm sure within others' that seeking Jesus Christ is the only way to be free from depression.  Hang in there.|`|e2c135bfafc7af2fe9af9e93ab38df0daa	yes.|`|09b6ff0f84a8558749c8e7da23d8911eaa	Yes.  Junk food can depress you believe it or not.  Your body functions better when you feed it healthy foods.  Mixing in some exercise (even long walks) will help even more.|`|4a099768fdb37f8b16856c74f9d99aa5aa	Most definitely, when you are depressed you tend to go for comfort foods--starchy, sweet things. They can mess up your blood sugar, making you tired. Also you are missing out on crucial nutrients in healthier foods like fish and vegetables that can help lift or prevent depression. Changing your diet can help your mental state hugely.

a769a8cb0655f3a8648d5bd2ff16f28aaa	ok no offense to the other answerers here but it sounds to me like they have no clue. they all gave you advice for losing weight along with fat..<br>  <br>  Now listen up. if you want to tone up and NOT lose any weight avoid cardio for a while. get to the weights. Some people think they have a great idea when they say they are going to get skinny AND THEN build muscle.. they are wrong! skinny people are skinny.. NOT muscular. if you want to tone up just lift weights and make sure you work all over the body with different weights. if you have a little chub that is GREAT!! because u have the extra chub you will tone much much faster!! so lift weights for awhile and try to take in a LOT of protein.. it is recommended that you take in 1Gram of protein per pound of body weight... Ex. 140lbs = 140 grams of protein EVERY DAY! if u fall a little short thats fine. I would suggest lifting for about 3 weeks out of the month and then 1 week of cardio. The reason I suggest avoiding cardio is because you will lose weight really fast. If you follow my advice and take the protein and lift weights you should stay about your same weight but with a tighter more defined body! if you do this for even 2 months you will feel great and notice some amazing changes! good luck! feel free to e-mail me if u have any questions.|`|yVk2vrLKaa	When we want to get rid of body fat, there is no way to specifically burn fat from one part of the body. Doing situps won't burn the fat that is covering your abs and doing tricep extensions won't get rid of the fat that is covering your triceps. The only thing you can do is lose weight all around and eventually the problem area will also improve. The way to burn fat is through a calorie restricted diet in conjunction with an exercise routine that will burn calories. Activities that burn calories include running, biking, swimming and other high intensity activities.<br>  <br>  Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://www.straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.straighthealth.com/pages/guid...</a><br>  The 9 Week Straight Diet - <a href="http://straightdiet.com" rel="nofollow">http://straightdiet.com</a><br>  Health, Exercise and Diets - <a href="http://straighthealth.com" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com</a>|`|DZK7rIHQaa	In order to tone by not lose any weight, you must burn fat and build muscle :)|`|cE75WGrvaa	Try walking for at least 2 1/2 to 3 miles twice a day and have a low carb, high protein diet in accordance with the 2000 calorie a day prefered diet. So less bread more chicken and lots of water. And how are you underweight if you have a double chin, stomach flab, and arm flab. All that should put you at least at a normal weight.
myG2hhaKaa	The Crest Whitening Strips have done a pretty good job. The changes might not be drastic, but they do look whiter. My BF said to me the other day, 'Your teeth look very white. You have good dental hygiene," lol.<br>  <br>  The only downfall is, they have started to cause some teeth sensitivity. (Although this is normal, as indicated on the directions.)

bghInW1Vaa	I think you are just being overly self concious. Everyone has underarm smell. You just notice yours more. <br>  Try switching to a different deoderant.<br>  See a dermatologist because if you actually have a problem with excessive perspiration, there is medication available.<br>  Don't worry so much. Your underarms smell the same as the underarms of the queen of England.|`|mZSkcgHUaa	A friend of mine had this.  Nothing could get rid of the smell.  In the end (years later) she had her glands removed from her armpits.  She's great now, no problems.  Go see you Doctor, see if he can get you to a specialist.  Take care.|`|P9XxUAjhaa	I seriously suggest a skin cleanse.  Your body might need to detox.  There are several ways to do this.  My favorite is soaking in a hot bath with 3-4 cups of epsom salts, then going to bed and piling the blankets on.  Be sure you have a healthy diet and drink lots of fluids.  Remember, your skin is an organ.  Whenj your liver is overloaded with detoxing, your skin is the next way to expell waste from your body.  Take care of your liver and skin, eat good, drink lots of water and cranberry juice and the problem should go away!|`|AA11471904	Drink plenty of water ( 4 litres a  day). Shave off the hair in the armpits. apply coconut oil in the arm pits at night time and bath in the morning. Avoid eating fatty foods, and eat plenty of vegetables and fruits.

Thats all try this for 2 or 3 days and post your result.|`|GOHr0SvXaa	I'm pretty sure that this has something to do with sweat glands, possibly over active.

AA11883289	It's not good.  Because I’ve helped a number of clients lose weight, here are a few pointers which might help, as well:<br>  <br>  * The key to weight loss is a very simple formula: burn more calories than you consume. It does not matter if you are eating hamburgers, brownies or carrot sticks; if you eat an excessive amount of food/calories, the excess will be turned to fat within hours.  The strategy is to restrict food intake, increasing exercise or both.  Obviously, the latter will accelerate the process.  Once again, it doesn’t not matter whether it's Weight Watchers, Atkins, South Beach Diet or whatever, the formula is the same.  The "fine print" of success, however, is the ability to adhere to a specific plan over a long period of time (i.e. keep the weight off). <br>  <br>  * Generally speaking, it does not matter if it takes you 7 minutes to run a mile or 15 minutes to walk it; the calories expended will be about the same.<br>  <br>  * One of the problems with going on a very rigid diet with a specific goal, is that it's usually a "quick fix" - the dieter attempts to gain a temporary solution to what is typically a chronic problem.  Often, the dieter tries to rigidly restrict eating by, for example, skipping meals or eating salads all day.  But trying not to eat is like trying not to breathe.  After a while, the body and mind rebel and, like a person gasping for air, the dieter loses control and binges.  As a result of the binge, the person feels that he has failed, gives up the diet altogether, eats more to make himself feel better, puts on some weight, feels even worse, gains even more weight, decides to try another restrictive diet, and begins the whole cycle all over again.<br>  <br>  * What is often overlooked, forgotten or dismissed, is that exercise is an essential part of any weight loss plan.  As long as you keep your body conditioned, with a shift of body composition [more] towards lean tissue instead of fat, your metabolism will increase permanently.  The more muscle and lean tissue you have, the more fat you will burn – all day long, even while you are resting.<br>  <br>  * The 10-calorie rule will enable you to lose a pound or two a week while supporting your basal metabolism (internal organ function, nervous system, etc.).  The rule is to allow 10 calories a day for each pound of your present body weight.  As you lose weight, you can gradually adjust calories downward to keep losing at this rate.  Thus, a person who starts at 220 pounds should eat 2,200 calories a day at first.  If your target weight is 180, then slowly reduce your calories to 1,800 a day. <br>  Another more aggressive approach is to institute a deficit of 500 calories a day for seven days (3,500 calories a week). Generally speaking, 3,500 calories equals one pound of body fat.  <br>  <br>  * Excess fat in the abdomen (e.g. men) is a much greater health risk than excess fat around the hips and thighs (e.g. women). The extra abdominal fat crowds the abdominal organs and the proximity to the liver means that, when metabolized, abdominal fat can raise blood cholesterol levels and lower the body's sensitivity to insulin.  Obviously, this sets the stage for diabetes.  Furthermore, the risk for disease rises significantly with a waist circumference of over 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women. <br>  <br>  * Despite what all the infomercials try and sell, there is no such thing as "spot reducing" (aka: losing fat in a particular location).  The fact is, muscles do not "own" the fat which surrounds them.  Since all body fat is shared by all the muscles and organs, spot reducing exercises that work only the flabby areas will not help to reduce the fat in that location.  However, tightening the muscles in trouble spots, through a more-complete exercise program, may improve the appearance of these areas…especially as time progresses.<br>  <br>  * Many dieters experience a temporary plateau after about 3 weeks; some may even notice a slight weight gain.  This is because they have gained water weight temporarily while they are still losing body fat.  The fat they are hoping to lose must be used for energy, which requires (among other elements) water to do this.  Once the water leaves the cells, it enters the blood, then the kidneys and finally into the bladder for excretion.  The signal that the plateau is over is frequent urination.<br>  <br>  Andy P; Certified Nutritionist<br>  @ PreventionProof.com|`|22IgtK0Gaa	No. It is good.|`|B2FdoEYAaa	Your BMI is not 21% it is more like 30.9% which indicates you are obese. You need to lose weight. Try activites like sports at school, running, walking, whatever..you got to get moving. Also, watch what you are eating. Keep a food journal and write down everything that you eat. If you dont get the weight off you are going to be very sick as you get older. You will have no energy for anything and it could end up killing you in the long run.

The weight range for your age is 85-123.<br>  <br>  I would suggest getting with your mom and talking about going to the Dr to talk about weight loss options.<br>  <br>  For now, avoid sugar (such as candy and pop), and anything fried like frnch fries.<br>  <br>  One healthy diet for people of all ages is one that includes all the food groups of lean meats, fruits, vegtables, and whole grains.<br>  <br>  And to avoid sugar, white potatoes, white rice and anything with white flour.|`|98oqDvCUaa	just stop eating sugary snacks(eat fruits as snack instead), <br>  <br>  stop drinking soda(drink only water)<br>  <br>  Stop eating mcdonald's or other fast foods(except subway)<br>  <br>  stop snacking at night before bedtime(eat dinner by 8.00 by the latest)<br>  <br>  include vegetables in your diet<br>  <br>  Stop eating candy<br>  <br>  lastly, eat three healthy meals a day and you'll be fine|`|759b251cb1f96062263eb5c2b92cf46eaa	I think you are getting confused. <br>  <br>  Body Mass Index and Body Fat Percentage are two different things.<br>  <br>  At 180lb, your Body Mass Index is 30.9, which is too high for both your age and height.<br>  <br>  It's unlikely that you have only 21% body fat at your current weight. You'd have to be extremely muscular like a body builder and being only 12, I can't see this as possible.<br>  <br>  I think it's great that you are working out, but try not to go overboard with the exercise. Just once a day is plenty and try to eat as healthily as possible. Definitely don't eat less than 1,500 calories as you are very young and growing and eating less than this could stunt your growth. <br>  <br>  The main thing is to eat healthily and stay active.<br>  <br>  Take care : )

I went to see my doctor and told him that I was getting a pain from an old injury by falling over.   He disagreed with that and said it was my heart like some was pricking me with a sharp knife.

It also operates the middle ear's muscles, and controls the rear two thirds of the tongue, making it important for both taste and to a minor extent, hearing. But even a pro can hit the nerve as it does not lay in the exact spot of every one just a general area .. If they muck it up you have at least a good law suit

eNkVSd9aaa	What a great idea! People need that kind of information. I took care of my grandmother for 3 months (until my family could get her into a specialized care facility) and it was the most challenging/rewarding/bittersweet time of my life with sad moments and tears, and funny moments and laughing-My best advice is to laugh at what you can or you will cry all the time. I will share a quick example: One day as I was caring for my grandma (who had been a widow for 12 years) she said to me that Don (my late grandpa) had left for work very early that day. I gently and sweetly reminded her that Grandpa had been dead for several years now and was up in heaven...to this she replied "Well then who the heck was that sleeping in my bed last night?" I had to laugh it was too funny and better than crying at the sadness of it. I love her so much!|`|00sn8G9paa	I forgot the question.

From your symptoms, I'll bet it is major depression.  Medication helps, but also try to get a referral to a good psychologist or therapist.  They can help you learn coping skills which will help minimize some of your frustration and they can also help you develop a sensible game plan that will work for you and your specific situation.<br>  <br>  Please be your own advocate here and don't take NO for an answer.

In order to get a bigger butt, which would be bad for your health,, would be to eat a lot of food and gain a lot of weight.  Part of this is going to be determined by your genes.  You could gain a lot of weight, but it does not guarantee that it will go to your hips.  What you need to evaluate is the reason that you want larger hips?

AA12206399	Speedwork is a term used to indicate that you are going to be running at a pace that is going to tax your system.  There are several types of speedwork.<br>  <br>  Intervals / repeats: This is generally a run of 200 meters to one mile (about 1600 meters) that is done at or near race pace. You basically run the specified distance and jog back or rest and repeat.  Depending upon your current fitness level, your rest period will vary.  Generally, for 10K, you'll want to focus on distances of about 800 meters to one mile.  Definitely, though, the 400 meter would be good as it teaches you faster leg turnover.<br>  <br>  (Lactate) Threshold Runs: This type of run is generally for 20 - 30 at a pace that is 10 - 15 seconds slower than your 10K race pace.  These are very important as they help build endurance.<br>  <br>  Hill Training can also be termed speedwork, as it is strengthening your legs and your aerboic system.<br>  <br>  I only do intervals once per week and lactate runs once a week as well.  Speedwork isn't that much fun but if you are looking to improve your times, it is the way to go.  It can also injure you being that it is stressful to your system.  <br>  <br>  You might want to pick up a copy of The Competitive Runner's Handbook : The Bestselling Guide to Running 5Ks through Marathons (Paperback)  by Bob Glover.

If it lasts long enough for you to be really worried about it, tell your family and see a doctor. There are all kinds of pains women have to go through in a lifetime. Believe me when I tell you that this is a small preview of things to come. In "The Long Kiss Goodnight," Gena Davis's character says to her daughter, "Life is pain, get used to it." This is true for anyone, but to me, being a woman is worth the pain I must endure...right down to the high heel shoes and the under-wire bras...for the joys and wonders that go with it! So don't be embarrassed, be proud! Keep your chin up because there are so many wonderful and amazing things that come from being a woman.

AA11168385	That is not a weird question at all.  <br>  <br>  Tampons are the ideal solution for active girls who play sports and especially swim, and even for other girls they are MUCH more comfortable than pads, they are cleaner than pads, and much more environmentally friendly than pads. <br>  <br>  Tampons do not hurt, and they are not at all uncomfortable, though sometimes girls are a little bit uncomfortable with the idea of inserting them at first.<br>  <br>  One way to get past your fear of using a tampon, is to become better acquainted with yourself.  Some time when you are not on your period, but before your next period, and when you have some time to be alone, take a few minutes to explore and see what the whole area is about.  This is something that is essential for any girl.  <br>  <br>  Get comfortable, use a hand mirror, and with your other hand spread yourself open and look around.  It is not dirty, or ugly, or wrong in any way, it is your body, you should know what it is about and how it works.  When you are comfortable, slip a finger inside a few inches.<br>  <br>  Next time you have a period, you will be ready to give a tampon a try, and will have a good idea what sort of experience to expect.  It is different, but it is not bad.  Honestly a tampon is WAY better than a pad ever was.  Don’t feel bad if you don’t get it quite right the first few times you try it – it can take a bit of practice.  Just keep trying until you get it right.  When it is right you won’t be able to feel it at all.<br>  <br>  Using a tampon with an applicator is easier at first, but I think the OB without the applicator is easier, more comfy to put in, and much better for the environment.  You will have to pick for yourself.<br>  <br>  Which ever one you get, follow the instructions on the box, and do not leave it in for longer than the instructions say is safe.|`|AA11996250	I'm scared to use tampons too.But i use pads.I just hate sticking tampons up you know what it realy hurts when i tryed it.Your just going to have to tell your mom to see if you can skip swimming class until your off your period.Your coach what ever you call it well he or she have to understand.And tell them that your realy scared to use tampons.well good luck with it.|`|1a53e475282b9dc554b55138e1e8daf1aa	I'm afraid too. =(|`|AA11085884	okay make sure you get a really small one for the first time. try a junior one. make sure its small!!!!! thats the key. get used to a small one bc its easier to ya know put in. also read the tss thing inside the box. and... some people use a mirror their first time its normal use one! relax relax relax. and just like have alot of time don't rush. make sure your in a room where your comfortable like the bathroom obviously and close the door. lock it! you'll feel much better. then just read the instructions and its okay to not know how. its okay. just keep practicing. it might take you a few tampons before it actually "works" good luck i hope its successful for you.|`|AA12062396	just make sure you <br>  <br>  1. insert in the correct hole<br>  <br>  2. have the correct end upwards<br>  and<br>  3. remove the cardboard applicator after its insterted.<br>  <br>  if it hurts, then you did not do it correctly and you should ask your mother or sister to help you.<br>  <br>  oh yeah, and don't leave it in for more than 4-6 hours, and dont' use them at night!<br>  <br>  and depending on how heavy your flow is that is how big around the tampon should be, not "how loose you are"|`|d4086b44b2572f4a2b80de832b48f02baa	Putting in a tampon is wierd at first but after you do it you cant feel it at all.

I know it can be embarissing and you dont want to ask anyone you acutally know. Remove the wrapper and take off your pants completely. It is really hard with them around your ankles. Spread your legs sort of far, and squat down so your legs are bent. Take the par without the string, and know that that is the part that goes inside you. Slowly begin to put it inside you. You may feel pressure, but you shouldnt feel pain. Be sure to do this ONLY when your on your period, it helps if your flow is quite heavy. i hold it like its a surenge for a shot, and that is the best way ro explain it. Put a few fingers on the outer cardboard and hold the inner one too. put the tampon in until your fingers touch the outside of your vagina. Be sure when you insert it that you go in an upward and backward motion. That how your vagina is built. Slowly push the inner tube into the outer tube. Once again, you should feel pressure. Not pain though.  then pull the applicator out of you, wrap it in a tissue, and throw it away.. it shouldnt hurt, and after a while you shouldnt even feel it.. if it hurts or feels like its not in all the way... then be sure to take the old one out, get a new one, and start over.<br>  <br>  Kaylee
16e5fd7730a97c9f85ee890bb74f388caa	Insect and spider bites often cause minor swelling, redness, pain, and itching. These mild reactions are common and may last from a few hours to a few days. Home treatment is often all that is needed to relieve the symptoms of a mild reaction to common stinging or biting insects and spiders.<br>  <br>  Some people have more severe reactions to bites or stings. Babies and children may be more affected by bites or stings than adults.<br>  <br>  Examples of problems that are more serious include:<br>  <br>      * A severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Severe allergic reactions are not common but can be life-threatening and require emergency care. Signs or symptoms may include:<br>            o Shock, which may occur if the circulatory system cannot get enough blood to the vital organs.<br>            o Coughing, wheezing, difficulty breathing, or feeling of fullness in the mouth or throat.<br>            o Swelling of the lips, tongue, ears, eyelids, palms of the hands, soles of the feet, and mucous membranes (angioedema).<br>            o Lightheadedness and confusion.<br>            o Nausea, diarrhea, and stomach cramps.<br>            o Hives and reddening of the skin. These symptoms often occur with other symptoms of a severe reaction.<br>      * A toxic reaction to a single sting or bite. Spiders or insects that may cause this include:<br>            o Black widow spider.<br>            o Brown recluse spider.<br>            o Hobo spider.<br>            o Scorpion.<br>            o Puss caterpillar (woolly slug).<br>      * A toxic reaction to multiple stings or bites from a bee, wasp, or fire ant.<br>            o A bee leaves it stinger behind and then dies after stinging. Africanized honeybees, the so-called killer bees, are more aggressive than common honeybees and often attack together in great numbers.<br>            o Wasps, including hornets and yellow jackets, can sting over and over. Yellow jackets cause the greatest number of allergic reactions.<br>            o A fire ant attaches to a person by biting with its jaws, then, pivoting its head it stings from its abdomen in a circular pattern at multiple sites.<br>      * A large skin reaction at the site of the bite or sting.<br>      * A skin infection at the site of the bite or sting.<br>      * Serum sickness, a reaction to the medications (antiserum) used to treat a bite or sting. Serum sickness may cause hives and flu-like symptoms 7 to 14 days after the use of antiserum.<br>      * A virus infection. Infected mosquitoes can spread the West Nile virus to people, causing an inflammation of the brain (encephalitis). For more information, see the topic West Nile Virus.<br>      * A parasite infection. Infected mosquitoes can spread malaria.

Postpartum depression is more likely to develop when there are cultural conflicts, environmental stressors and/or a predisposition to depression. Symptoms may go unrecognized until the depression has impaired the mother's daily functioning. There is little research about Latinas who experience postpartum depression. Latinas may be at additional risk because of cultural considerations and adherence to traditional roles of women. Postpartum depression is treatable when detected early. Common policy in hospitals and medical settings relies on mothers to report depressive feelings. Postpartum depression has a better prognosis when identified in pregnancy. This study suggests a preventive, culturally considerate treatment model when treating postpartum Latina mothers. Implications for future research in this area are also explored.

Its really easy to down a liter or two while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart. "<br>  <br>  ROTFLMAO!! <br>  There's no proof that anyone needs that much water. NONE. Just folklore, urban myth, old wives' tale. (See references) And the belief that "it helps your body pick out the nutrients" is just plain unfounded. Your body does a fine job "picking out" nutrients with or without excess fluids.<br>  <br>  Bottom line: Drink when you're thirsty. Period. Do not obsess over or worry about getting some arbitrary amount of water as a daily "goal". You already get most of the water your body needs from the food you consume. <br>  The rest of Krista's advice is reasonable.

Not so many cakes and donuts and cookies. Basic common sense for eating, you just need to enforce it. Get all the bad stuff out of the house right away, just toss it or give it away while your still motivated. No alcohol and no smoking if that applies. Lots of water, 2-3 liters a day, not all at once, but spread it out. Its really easy to down a liter while your watching tv or on the computer. Also drink some after you eat the bigger meals of the day, it helps your body pick out the nutrients in food when your food is more spread apart. Don’t think that sports drinks can replace water, the only time you need to drink them right after a workout, besides that just stick with water. These rules may be hard to adapt to at first so start with cutting out the things you know you can live without. Then work from there. Remember these are perfect eating habits, it can take you a while to work into it. If you know you can’t live without your one treat a day, don’t fight it by trying to eat something else, just eat it and make sure that’s the only one you cheat on a day. Otherwise you’ll get depressed and quit. Another important point is getting the right amount of sleep every night. You need 8-9 hours of sleep each night for your body to function correctly. This is an important factor of losing weight. Set up a routine for yourself and go to bed at about the same time each night. <br>  As for exercise, lots of cardio. Find something you like. If you have never exercised much before, start with walking 30 minutes a day at a brisk pace. Move on to different terrains that include hills and increase the time spent. After a week or two, try jogging the route. No matter what find an activity you enjoy. Walking to jogging is just an example, try hiking, rollerblading, biking. Once you get into a regular routine, if your not happy with the level of difficulty, try signing up with a gym. Spinning, pilates or kickboxing classes are great. It will also introduce you to working with weights. Talk to a trainer for instruction before using any weights. A cheap investment is a balance ball, it works you stomach while your just sitting on it, like at your computer and its great for posture.

However, I would start exercising ASAP (like progressively walking up and down a flight of stairs for 5, 10 and 20 min a day).   You may also want to try THINS.  It's a natural appetite suppressant (no stimulants, etc)  which helped me lose about 7 pounds a week.  Not the healthiest approach, I know, but I was impatient and wanted to see quick results so I talk a few extra of the chocolate wafers. You can get it from PreventionProof.com.  I was simply impressed with the fact that their research was very credible (Baylor College of Medicine, Georgetown University, American College of Cardiology, etc.) and not from some doctor’s endorsement who was also "on the payroll".  ;-))  Good luck.

The first few years you start having your period are pretty irregular to begin with.  Are you a thin person?  Often women with low body weight have irregular periods.

AA11883289	Not at all.  This is what I learned from Olympic coach Jack Medina, after attending a nutriceutical convention in AZ.  It's a little deep:<br>  <br>  Creatine is one of the most popular of the currently hyped supplements.<br>  <br>  Meat, poultry, and fish provide rich sources of creatine. Because the animal kingdom contains the richest creatine-containing foods, vegetarians have a distinct disadvantage in obtaining ready sources of creatine. <br>  <br>  Creatine supplements, sold as creatine monohydrate, come as a powder, tablet, capsule, and stabilized liquid. Currently, an athlete can supplement with creatine in international competition because governing bodies (including the International Olympic Committee) do not consider creatine an illegal substance – yet! <br>  <br>  Creatine received notoriety as an ergogenic (muscle growth) aid when used by British sprinters and hurdlers in the 1992 Barcelona Olympic Games. Creatine levels at the recommended level exert ergogenic effects in short-duration, high-intensity exercise (5-10% improvement) without producing harmful side effects. However, there is a possible association between creatine supplementation and cramping in multiple muscle areas during competition or lengthy practice by football players and other athletes. Gastrointestinal tract disturbances such as nausea, indigestion, and difficulty absorbing food have also been linked to creatine ingestion. <br>  <br>  Oral supplements of creatine monohydrate (20-25 g per day) significantly increase muscle creatine and performance in high intensity, particularly repeated intense muscular effort. This effect does not vary between vegetarians or meat eaters. <br>  <br>  For division I football players, creatine supplementation with resistance training increased body mass, lean body mass, cellular hydration, and muscular strength and performance. However, creatine supplementation does NOT improve exercise performance that requires a high level of aerobic energy. It also has little effect on isometric (static) muscular strength or dynamic force measured during a brief single movement.<br>  <br>  The Risks <br>  Limited research exists about potential dangers of creatine supplementation in healthy individuals, particularly the effect on cardiac muscle and kidney function. As a nutritional supplement, creatine requires less stringent regulations governing its manufacturing standards, purity, and reporting of adverse side effects than if classified as a drug. <br>  <br>  Not all research reports positive results from standard creatine supplementation. For example, no effects on exercise performance, fatigue resistance, and recovery appeared for untrained subjects performing a single 15-second bout of sprint cycling, sport specific physical activities such as swimming, cycling, and running.|`|AA11405050	before and if you want a little boost you could take some after too|`|5f932d3bb09772dee881448e116d3397aa	you take it before you work out, read the directions!

AA11883289	You should only consider products with credible, non-fabricated, non-exaggerated, non-borrowed research.  Unless a company can produce research where their supplements are SPECIFICALLY credited (and not eluded to) and that the data is placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over, peer-reviewed and then published in a prestigious medical or nutriceutical journal (e.g. Baylor College of Medicine, Georgetown University, American College of Cardiology, etc.), then it's nothing more than conjecture and hype - and oftentimes from some doctor who's "on the payroll".

One of the best things you can do is be reasonable when you choose the size.  If they are gigantic, they will look fake no matter what and you will regret it.  I have 350cc smooth round moderate profile saline implants that were inserted through the areola, and the scars are almost impossible to see.  I followed my doctors instructions and massaged them after surgery.  They are so soft that you almost cant tell they are fake.  Do your research about your doctor--make sure he is board certified.  Be a good patient and take care of your body and you will be one step ahead in this game.|`|ffc23e34ef3110fce2afb94df415f202aa	I have them but wish I didn't now.

When you eat whole foods that are full of nutrients your body will know how much to eat and how much not to eat. You do not have to count calories because your body is a wonderful machine. Suggest eating veggies, fruits, and proteins. Stay away from junk food, fried food, and anything else that you feel is bad for you.<br>  <br>  * Eat fresh fruit<br>  Eat at least two servings of fresh fruit every day. Choose whatever type of fruit is in season. Also consume protein because both fruits and protein can fill you up and it makes your stomach seem like its full.<br>  <br>  * Drink enough water<br>  Drink the best weight loss supplement known to man, water. Most people do not know the difference from being hungry for food or thirsty for water. A great deal of times people eat when they should drink. Most likely you will not feel as hungry if you are getting enough water. You will be satisfying the thirst, which is confused for hunger. Water also helps you digest food better. Drinking water before you eat will help fill you up.<br>  <br>  * Always chew your food<br>  Always chew your food well. Chewing your food well will ensure that you get the most nutrients out of your food. Getting the most nutrients will satisfy your body therefore you will eat less. Another benefit of chewing well is that it helps aid in digestion.<br>  <br>  * Take small meals<br>  Eat small, frequent meals in a day. Large meals tax your digestion system, making it work harder. Taking too much time in between meals makes you hungrier for the next meal. That means eat 5-6 meals a day instead of 3 huge meals a day.<br>  <br>  * Include protein at meal<br>  Include good sources of protein at meal, chicken, fish, legumes, peanut, cottage cheese, eggs or yogurt.<br>  <br>  * Shut off TV while eating<br>  Shut off the TV whenever you eat – that includes meals and snacks. Studies show that we automatically eat larger portions when we snack in front of the tube, and typically those foods are high in fat and sugar, which means excess calories! <br>  <br>  * Increase your physical activity ( Cardio )<br>  Increase your physical activity. Most people are over weight because of a lack of physical activity. Start walking more, bicycling, walks your dog for longer periods of time, swim, dance and leave the car at home when you can. It’s important that you choose a physical activity that you enjoy because you’ll stick with it.<br>  <br>  *Weight training ( Light 5 to 10 lbs )<br>  buy some dumbells that are 5-10 lbs and do some exercises with them. Search google: Dumbell exercises and you will see a bunch of useful links along with pictures and description on how to do it.

My husband has the same problem and what worked for him was not to eat a large meal after 7pm. At night your body takes longer to process and turn the food you eat into engery adn because you are not as active at night as you are in the day, when you eat a big meal at night, it stays with you, whereas in the day, you eat but you lose alot of waht you eat by being busy, either walking or running, but at night you dont exercise so your body slows down turning food into energy so to stop yourself from gaining excessive weight, watch what time you eat, anything after 7pm shoudl be a light snack like yogurt or just a muffin or fruit. Also eating alot of dairy products help cut calories. What worked for me after i hd my daughter was breastfeeding and walking with my baby in the stroller. You dont even have to walk fast jsut walk for aout 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes later in the day, not even every day, 3 times a week is enough, but walking is the best way to lose weight. I lost all my pregnancy weight through walking 3 days a week for 30 minutes in the morning when my hubby went to work and 30 minutes in the late afternoon or when my hubby got home from work, we would walk as a family adn this gave us some time to tlak without the tv or radio being on....give it a try!|`|85dd3e1a2e5f17251258499b9309d5a4aa	Well what you want to loose is "fat" not just any old "weight".<br>  The best most effective way of loosing fat is by eating 20% under your daily maintenance calorie level. This way you keep your body out of starvation mode, where you will burn muscle instead of fat.<br>  You should be eating 5-6 smaller meals per day and working out 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Adam Beazley|`|AA11608220	Cut your carbs drastically....Try to ONLY eat them for breakfast, dont eat anything after 7pm except water...drink lots and lots of water..and get ur baby on his stroller and walk for like 30 min a day....|`|AA12066552	Cut off your head you will lose 8 lbs right a way.

I think 6-12 months recovery, depending on the site of the dvt and the dr you are seeing.  <br>  <br>  FYI, as I said mine was 3 years ago, and I still have swelling in my leg.  Too much exercising, standing, sitting....any of this makes my leg swell.  I've been told that this is permanent by my vascular surgeon.  The best advice I can offer you once you are healed is to keep hydrated and to keep moving.  Don't sit for too long, get up to get your blood flowing.  And if exercising, take breaks to allow your leg a rest.  I have found that the best form of exercising is swimming.  It just doens't bother my leg like running or walking can.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, it's not an easy road but it is managable.|`|5191bb63d0071608c0e71aab1c451c70aa	depends on the site ot the dvt:<br>  1.treatment for dvt of the the leg(the part below the knee) can last upto three months depending on the outcome of the scan done at 3 months.<br>  2.treatment for dvt of the thigh and leg may last upto 6 months depending on the scan results.<br>  so for peace of mind consult with your doctor about his/her treatment plan for u and let him/her know your frustrations|`|2019e5deef4c0f270a4ec62663690b34aa	what is dvt?<br>  not sure what it is but i do know that Transfer factors help most things!<br>  if you would like to see the products and info go to<br>  <br>  www.kristie.4healthdirect com<br>  <br>  t/f plus advanced or riovida juice(if you don't like swallowing pills) are the strongest they boost your immune system by up to 235%!<br>  and i can send you some prod success stories so you can see what it helps if you are interested, you can contact me through the shop.<br>  good luck:)

421ca1bdd6a77034a94e8fd08ca30ca5aa	Unfortunately there is no cure but there r some things u can do to help the condition. Stay hydrated, the less dry ur skin, the better. When u bathe: use soap-free cleansers, cool water (hot water strips ur skin of its natural oils) keep the bath/shower short, pat urself dry (don't rub) use a moisturizer on ur skin immediately after u dry off..just don't use anything with scents or perfumes..actually plain petroleum jelly or something petroleum based is very good. An oatmeal bath is suppose to help...just pour uncooked oats into ur bath water n soak for awhile. (I've never tried this cuz my eczema is on my hands)  Apply cortisone cream..if u itch/scratch alot at night, take an antihistamine. Seeing a Dr. would of course b more helpful.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f135a677c752d0016c020e3634614a4faa	Since you just got eczema about 3 to 4 years ago, it may not be a hereditary cause.  Try changing your soap for bathing and detergent for washing clothes.  It might be an allergy.  Perhaps, its a food you are eating that is causing the itchiness and hence an eczema affect of dry and broken skin.<br>  <br>  Also think of something that you are doing different from 3 to 4 years ago.  There might be an external cause.<br>  <br>  My daughter was born with eczema and we use a certified organic skin care cream called Miessense Intensive Body Cream.  It works better than Eucerin and other over the counter cream because it doesn't have any chemical additives.  My daughter's skin is very sensitive to those chemical additives found in most creams, so the Miessense works really good for her.<br>  <br>  The cream is to keep your eczema under control until you find out whats causing your itchiness.  Like I said, it might not be eczema, and it could be a controllable allergic reaction to something that is causing you to scratch you skin into an eczema like state.<br>  <br>  I buy the cream from this site:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.organixandme.mionegroup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.organixandme.mionegroup.com</a><br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1de4fb35a2f65dff85f710ed552d0236aa	as far as i know there isn't a cure for eczema. i also have it. i was told it is  a hereditary skin disorder. i've looked and looked but have found nothing to suggest a cure for it. tried many things and nothing has worked. good luck in your search, let me know if you find something that cures it plz.|`|32d3d109678b2b2a5939ee720b73b006aa	go to www.safemedsforless.com.

Divide your weight by your height in metre2. The result should be a value between 20 and 25. If you are heavier, you need to reduce it. In your case, let us calculate:<br>  <br>  96<br>  ---------------  = 28.98<br>  1.82 x 1.82<br>  <br>  You have to get your weight down to 82kg which means you have to lose close to 15kg just to come to the outside limit of ideal weight.

There are many tiny blood vessels in the nostrils that dilate and, thus, contribute to a runny nose. The action of blowing the nose will lead to further dilation of the blood vessels and... more running of the nose.<br>  <br>  Instead of blowing, hold a tissue under your nose to "catch" what's running out. It may seem less effective at first, but your nose may begin to dry up with this gentle treatment. Some other things that help to "clear out" a runny or stuffed nose are: steaming over a pot of boiling water, sitting in a steam room, eating hot and spicy foods, and running or exercising outside." <br>  <br>  <br>  I've also heard that sex can cure a runny nose, Lol hey, if your desperate right.|`|f3f91dd57aebd8b8c7e30811c1868857aa	treat it right and it will not run (away) hahaha|`|2019e5deef4c0f270a4ec62663690b34aa	hi, i sell products that boost the immune system by up to 437%! this stops almost every baddie.<br>  they are called transfer factors and they are the smallest molecules in colostrum(mothers 1st milk that gives baby's baby its immune system) and they increase the activity of the natural killer cells 5 times more than anything known - its your NK cells that kill bacteria, malignancies, fungi and viruses on contact.<br>  <br>  if you are interested you can view the products, prices and info in my on line shop, if you would like prod success stories, questions answered or more info you can contact me through the shop. <br>  cheers KT:).
AA10015556	Well you have to spend $5-$10 a pill, find a good source, hope you don't get busted, find a way to trick or avoid drug tests (if that's a problem), and figure out your dosage. Not to mention hiding it from everyone.<br>  <br>  It mostly just allows you to stay up and focus more. Caffeine helps creativity and making connections between things, so it might work a little better depending on the situation. <br>  <br>  Be sure to avoid using it every day unless you want to end up addicted.<br>  <br>  Be careful and good luck.|`|0e984ab2e649d485503623e340112ae0aa	don't do it, man|`|a02e14729f156bf36a6e175f9f72f677aa	Well...<br>  <br>  It certainly CAN be used as a study stimulant.  You'll have to play with the dosage, however, because it varies from individual to individual, depending on body weight, and a number of other factors.<br>  <br>  If you are under 16, however, I would not recommend it, as it tends to have a synergic effect, which is why it "calms" ADHD kids down, instead of stimulating them.<br>  <br>  Caffeine and sugar are also good study stimulants.<br>  <br>  When taking a test, med students will often take-in large quantities of sugar and caffeine, and sometimes boost it with 2 units of Human Insulin, to aid metabolism of the sugar.  <br>  <br>  Not that I'm suggesting you do so, but the science behind it is sound.  <br>  <br>  The human brain can ONLY use sugar.  Not proteins, not fats, not triglycerides.  It is the only organ in the body which has that distinction.  Making more sugar available to the brain, via sugar intake, caffeine catalyst, or increased insulin, does "temporarily" make your brain work faster.  This may or may not have value to you.  <br>  <br>  Insulin does not require a prescription in most states to obtain, as it is an over-the-counter substance.  The needles are another matter.  Insulin is injected into the thick skin of the back of the upper arm, abdomen, or outer thigh.  <br>  <br>  Exceeding 2 units, however, for a non-diabetic person of healthy weight WILL cause serious side effects, and can be lethal.  <br>  <br>  I hope this was helpful.<br>  <br>  Namaste,<br>  <br>  --Tom|`|9043c2e340840d11ce8e183fd0206c99aa	Don't be an idiot.

The mere sound of vomiting generally causes me to begin to heave and seriously kicks my gag reflex into overdrive.  Have never had a panic attack from vomiting myself nor from being near someone else doing it, but have thrown up because someone else was near me doing it.  I also cannot clean it up.  One hundred rags would not be enough; I can feel the slime aspect of the vomit, no matter how many layers of cloth or toweling is between it and my hand.  This also happens when I try to clean up raw eggs(same consistency as vomit I guess).  It was tough having a new baby.    What finally helped was when my grandson threw up all over me.  My initial response was to throw him across the room as I dashed for the bathroom to GET IT OFF!!!..Then I caught myself and reminded myself that I could not toss my grandson- he did not do it on purpose he was sick.  He was not big enough to clean it up, so I was going to have to do it.

If I am in a house with someone that has a stomach ache I won't use the bathroom my most recent incident was new years day I was at my boyfriends house and he had a pretty bad hangover and was puking all day by the middle of the day he was so weak he wasn't sure if he could make it to the bathroom and so I sat there stressing so bad I was even starting to get tears in my eyes because I was panicing so bad I even had to leave his house.

Eat a lot of red meat and in your case a lot of fatty foods..pasta is good too...and work out every day doing cardio and weight training.

That is as tall as you will grow.  Your mom likely has that in a baby book or something.  You will probably be an inch or two taller than your dad.  Our products are so full of steroids and growth hormones that our children are becoming taller than they should and hitting peuberty younger and younger...  Or you could go to this site and see what it tells you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.rad.washington.edu:8080/stature/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rad.washington.edu:8080/statu...</a>|`|da43dabf7871960d74ed399773611dfaaa	A general assumption and survey results say you'll probably end up 5'8".|`|53a74743d23e11adcec737c47684f9f0aa	Assuming a similar diet to your parents, the estimated height of a male based on parents heights is (fathers height + mother's height + 5" ) / 2.<br>  <br>  Which for you would be 5'6".  Personally, I grew a lot between 14 and 18, but it sounds like you started puberty early - which was not uncommon for a lot of shorter guys I knew.  I'd be surprised if you don't clear 5'6", but if you hit 5'9", i'd be surprised too.|`|7953f3ecddcbc0ee32249c3c54567cedaa	Just sleep as much as possible and stretch out more often. Also, dont listen to the people that say caffeine and cigarettes stunt your growth. Its bs. Your lucky.. id rather be shorter. (15, 5'10)  <br>  <br>  You'll probably be around 5'10-6'1 but you never know..|`|N5QjzBRUaa	hard to say, but ur sitll growing.  men tend to have their growth spurt later than women.  ur only 14, i know ppl who grew like 4 inches in one summer while in high school.  ur fine, just dont smoke or drink caffeine so u wont stunt ur growth.|`|UKdiEg8Eaa	This is actually a hard question. I know of someone who was 5'6" at the end of high school but is 34 now and is 6'5" so 6'1" is my guess.|`|h0GWKMEqaa	You are still young and you will hit a growth spirt around the age of 18.  I think you'll be at least 5'9" and probably taller.  Don't worry about it too much.  There are lots of hot short guys around.  Girls love them!|`|tHKn7Lzxaa	You still have much time to grow! Don't worry about it! Even if you stay 5'4 which I doubt you will, but what's wrong with being 5'4? Work with what you got kiddo!
Z0fSykr7aa	To lose weight you must find this: what is your daily caloric intake requirement?? <br>  Some helpful sites to figure that out are... <a href="http://www.mypyramid.gov" rel="nofollow">http://www.mypyramid.gov</a>   or   <a href="http://www.diet-blog.com/archives/2005/12/26/how_to_calculate_your_daily_calorie_needs.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.diet-blog.com/archives/2005/1...</a><br>  Once you know that its more simple.  Weight is about balance.  If the calories you eat and the calories you burn exercising equal your caloric intake requirement than you will maintain your weight.  If it is less you will lose weight and if it is more you will gain weight.  However there is a balance.  If too little calories are taken in or too many are expended ( a good goal for acceptable is not more than 500 calories above or below your required caloric intake) over a long period of time health problems can precipitate ranging from mild to severe.  A healthy weight loss recommendation is 2lbs every 2 weeks.  Its slow I know, but its the healthiest method for your body.<br>  <br>  As far as your diet, you have the right idea with including fruits and vegetables, but you will need variety.  A diet is a lifestyle, not a quick solution, and one cannot realistically eat such a narrow selection indefinitely.  You also should have a higher caloric intake than you wrote.  And if you do not decide to eat red meat as a woman you should take an iron supplement.  Not all vitamins include iron, however it is very important to every woman's health!<br>  <br>  Also... you should ask yourself why you want to lose weight.  At 5'7 and 127lbs your BMI is 19.9 (a healthy range is 18 to 25) so you are quite perfect!  If it is to "look better" than consider modifying your healthy exercise to include some cardio as well as small muscle exercise (tricep extensions, bicep curls, rows, crunches, pushups, etc) using a small weight for many repititions.|`|twMRkztGaa	You are young and your body is still growing.  You are not getting enough calories with the work you are doing.  You will break yourself down.  Keep up your work, and try to eat about 1200 calories. This will raise your metabolism.   It should tone your muscles and burn fat.  Always seek a professional help so you don't injure yourself.|`|OWmFD6OLaa	ohh totally not enoguh calories girl! plus five seven and 127 is not that out of shape especially if u exercise (muscle weighs more than fat).  What you need to do is don't eat after your a little bit full and cut thee empty callories ie pizza, pop, valentines candy.|`|AA10412926	Breakfast= u should eat something bigger like eggs..breakfast is the most important meal of the day...maybe u should eat fruits..<br>  Lunch=good except for the fruits...i found out that u should wait about 18 minutes after a meal to eat fruits because if u et it right after u eat a meal, the fruit will turn into pure sugar and thats really bad..<br>  Snack=Bad...u should eat a bowl of cereal with fat free skim milk..of fruits..something with less calories and fat but will satisfy your hunger<br>  <br>  And for the liquid that u drink and the vitemines..thats great..<br>  <br>  Remember..try not to alot after 6:00 pm...eat like a little 60 calorie yogurt of a special K bar that has only 90 calories and very delicious too..|`|AA10686773	If you are working out a lot, you definitely need more calories than that.  A typical diet should consist of 1500 - 1800 calories a day.  It sounds like you are very active and thin, so make sure you don't compromise your health by not eating enough.|`|P9XxUAjhaa	Stay away from the lean pocket.  Instead try a fresh spinach salad filled with tomatoes, cucumbers, dried cranberries, etc.  This diet seems finem but remember, your body needs variation in order to get all the nutrients it needs.  Don't limit yourself to this.  You are perfectly proportioned on a height to weight ratio.  Maybe you should just try exercising more to feel better about yourself.  Add toning exercises, etc.  You shouldn't lose any weight.  Drinking water is great!  Never drink soda and avoid fruit juice!|`|ea96ffd32e93cfdf652f20abea901970aa	You need WAY more cals! If you're 17 and weigh 127 i'd say ur pretty bangin' so i wouldn't loose much weight at all if i were you bc there is a thing as "too skiny". I'd juut keep doing what u are doing. You are getting in a great physical workout and burning off any bad things you eat by those physical exercises.

Muscles only grow because we put demands on them...if you work one muscle harder than the other, that muscle will grow bigger.|`|AA11392272	Absolutely, muscles build and work independently from each other. However, this is not uncommon, most people have one arm that is stronger than the other, and yes, alot of those muscles are more well developed. The difference is usually unnoticeable by anyone other than that person and for the difference to be dramatic that person would have to purposely work out one more than the other to achieve such a result.|`|ab77c3b937a936ba8dfb4b9742f17a67aa	Yes.|`|mZSkcgHUaa	Yes it is possible.  Right handed people always have a bigger hand, wrist and forearm than their left.  They use that hand/arm more than the left.   Vice versa if you are left handed.  If you are right handed and working out with your left hand/bisep ... it's not going to make much difference because you are still using your right hand for everyday things.|`|P9XxUAjhaa	Uh, yes!  Your muscle builds from resistance and consistency.  Naturally if you only lift on one side it will build up.  <br>  <br>  Are you going somewhere else on this one?  If so, switch hands once in a while...
3078cd70f433dfb3bb90750ecbb76adbaa	It's not unusual to have a heavy discharge after your period.   It's your body's way of cleaning itself out.<br>  <br>  Any hormone shift can cause a discharge.  In fact, any change can cause it - if you are more stressed lately or have had a change in medication, etc.<br>  <br>  As long as it is not accompanied by an itch or a strong odor, you probably have nothing to worry about.  If you do have other symptoms, see your doctor.|`|P9XxUAjhaa	It is normal for you to have some discharge as your bodies normal way of cleansing itself.  This can also happen when you ovulate.  It should NOT have any odor at all.  Should be kind of a milky color and should not last for more than 2-3 days.  If you notice it continues longer than that, you might need to get a prescription for bacterial vaginosis.

kw5Mst7Gaa	Pasos para dejar de fumar<br>  <br>  A menudo los fumadores dicen: "no me digas por qué debo dejar de fumar, dime cómo". No existe una manera correcta para abandonar el hábito de fumar, pero existen algunos elementos clave para lograrlo con éxito. Estos cuatro factores son esenciales:<br>  <br>  Tomar la decisión de dejar de fumar. <br>  Fijar una fecha y establecer un plan para dejar el hábito. <br>  Manejar los síntomas de abstinencia. <br>  Mantenerse sin fumar (mantenimiento). <br>  <br>  Pasos para tomar la decisión de dejar de fumar<br>  <br>  Dejar de fumar es una decisión que sólo usted puede tomar. Otras personas pueden querer que usted abandone el hábito, pero es usted quien tiene que hacer el compromiso real.<br>  <br>  Los investigadores han observado cómo y por qué la gente deja de fumar, y tienen algunas ideas, o modelos, de cómo esto ocurre.<br>  <br>  El Modelo de Creencias de la Salud indica que usted tendrá más probabilidades de dejar de fumar si:<br>  <br>  Cree que puede contraer una enfermedad a causa del hábito y esto le preocupa. <br>  Cree que puede tratar sinceramente de dejar de fumar. <br>  Cree que los beneficios de abandonar el hábito son mayores que los beneficios de continuar fumando. <br>  Conoce a alguien que ha tenido problemas de salud debido al hábito de fumar. <br>  <br>  ?Está usted en alguno de estos casos?<br>  <br>  El Modelo de Cambio de Etapas identifica las etapas que la persona atraviesa al realizar un cambio en su comportamiento. A continuación aparecen las etapas del proceso de dejar de fumar:<br>  <br>  Precontemplación: en esta etapa, el fumador no está pensando seriamente en dejar de fumar de inmediato. <br>  <br>  Contemplación: el fumador que está pensando activamente en dejar el cigarrillo, pero no está lo suficientemente listo como para hacer un intento serio. Esta persona puede decir: "Sí, estoy listo para dejar de fumar, pero la tensión en el trabajo es demasiada",  o "no quiero subir de peso" o "no estoy seguro de poder hacerlo".<br>  <br>  Preparación: los fumadores que se encuentran en esta etapa intentan seriamente dejar de fumar el próximo mes, y a menudo han tratado de abandonar el hábito en el transcurso de los últimos 12 meses. éstos suelen tener un plan.<br>  <br>  Acción: consiste en los primeros 6 meses en los que el fumador está abandonando el hábito.<br>  <br>  Mantenimiento: el período de seis meses a cinco a?os después de haber abandonado el cigarrillo, cuando el ex fumador reconoce el peligro que representaría recaer en el hábito y toma medidas para evitarlo.<br>  <br>  ?En qué etapa está usted según este modelo? Si piensa dejar de fumar, fije una fecha y establezca un plan que lo conduzca a la etapa de preparación, la mejor para empezar.<br>  <br>  <br>  Métodos para seleccionar una fecha para dejar de fumar y establecer un plan<br>  <br>  Una vez usted haya tomado la decisión de dejar de fumar, está listo para elegir una fecha. Este es un paso muy importante. Elija una fecha específica en el próximo mes como su "Día para dejar de fumar". Si escoge una fecha a largo plazo, esto le dará tiempo para pensar y cambiar de opinión. Sin embargo, es bueno que se tome el tiempo necesario para prepararse y hacer un plan. Puede elegir una fecha que tenga un significado especial, como un cumplea?os o aniversario, o el "Gran día para dejar de fumar" (el tercer jueves de noviembre de cada a?o) o simplemente escoja una fecha cualquiera. Marque con un círculo la fecha en su calendario. Haga un compromiso firme y personal de abandonar el hábito en esa fecha.<br>  <br>  No existe una manera correcta para dejar el cigarrillo. La mayoría de los fumadores prefiere abandonar el hábito de repente y por completo. Siguen fumando hasta el "Día para dejar de fumar", y entonces dejan de hacerlo de una sola vez. También puede ser que fumen menos cigarrillos una o dos semanas antes de la fecha que han elegido para dejar de fumar. Otra manera de abandonar el hábito consiste en reducir el número de cigarrillos al día. Con este método, usted  va reduciendo gradualmente la cantidad de nicotina en su cuerpo. Usted puede eliminar el cigarrillo que fuma cuando toma café o decidir fumar solamente en ciertos momentos del día. Aunque el método de reducir el número de cigarrillos para ir dejando de fumar gradualmente parece lógico, por lo general es difícil de llevar a cabo.  <br>  <br>  Dejar de fumar es muy parecido a bajar de peso: requiere de un compromiso firme por largo tiempo. Los fumadores quisieran que existiera un método o una pastilla mágica que hiciera fácil y placentero el proceso de abandonar el hábito. Pero éste no es el caso. Los sustitutos de nicotina pueden ayudar a reducir los síntomas de abstinencia, pero éstos son más eficaces cuando se usan como parte de un plan para dejar de fumar que trate tanto el componente físico como el psicológico.   <br>  <br>  A continuación se presentan algunos pasos que le ayudarán a prepararse para el "Día para dejar de fumar":<br>  <br>  Escoja la fecha y márquela en su calendario. <br>  Comunique a sus amigos y familiares el día en que dejará de fumar. <br>  Deshágase de todos los cigarrillos y ceniceros que haya en su casa, carro y trabajo. <br>  Tenga disponible sustitutos orales: goma de mascar sin azúcar, trozos de zanahoria y caramelos macizos. <br>  Establezca un plan. ?Utilizará terapia de reemplazo de nicotina u otros medicamentos? ?Irá a alguna clase para dejar de fumar? Si es así, inscríbase de inmediato. <br>  Practique la frase: "No gracias, yo no fumo". <br>  Establezca un sistema de apoyo. éste puede consistir en un grupo de personas, Nicotine Anonymous  o un amigo o familiar que haya dejado de fumar y que esté dispuesto a ayudarle. Pídales que no fumen a su alrededor ni que dejen los cigarrillos donde usted pueda verlos. <br>  Piense sobre sus intentos previos de dejar de fumar. Procure analizar qué fue lo que funcionó y qué fue inútil. <br>  <br>  El éxito en dejar de fumar es cuestión de planificación y compromiso, no de suerte. Haga ahora mismo su propio plan. Algunas posibilidades incluyen usar la terapia de reemplazo de nicotina, incorporarse a una clase para dejar de fumar, asistir a las reuniones de Nicotine Anonymous o utilizar materiales de autoayuda, tales como libros y folletos. Para la mejor probabilidad de éxito, su plan debe incluir una o más de estas opciones.<br>  <br>  En su "Día para dejar de fumar", siga las siguientes recomendaciones:<br>  <br>  No fume. Esto significa en lo absoluto: ?ni siquiera una bocanada! <br>  Manténgase activo: trate de caminar, hacer ejercicio o participar en otras actividades o pasatiempos. <br>  Tome mucha agua y jugos. <br>  Comience a usar la terapia de reemplazo de nicotina, si así lo ha elegido. <br>  Vaya a una clase para dejar de fumar o siga un plan de autoayuda. <br>  Evite las situaciones de alto riesgo que conducen al impulso de fumar. <br>  Reduzca o evite el consumo de alcohol. <br>  Considere cambiar su rutina. Escoja una ruta distinta para llegar a su trabajo, beba té en vez de café, desayune en un lugar distinto o coma algo diferente. <br>  <br>  Métodos para enfrentarse a los síntomas de abstinencia<br>  Los síntomas de abstinencia de la nicotina son de dos tipos: físicos y psicológicos. Los síntomas físicos, aunque molestos, no representan un riesgo para la vida. El tratamiento de reemplazo de nicotina puede ayudar a reducir muchos de estos síntomas físicos. Sin embargo, para la mayoría de los fumadores, los síntomas mentales que se presentan al tratar de abandonar el hábito son los más difíciles de superar.<br>  <br>  Si usted ha estado fumando por determinado tiempo, el acto de fumar se ha vinculado a casi todo lo que usted hace: despertarse por la ma?ana, comer, leer, ver televisión y tomar café entre otras cosas. Le tomará tiempo "desvincular" este acto de tales actividades. Por esta razón, incluso si usted está usando un reemplazo de nicotina, puede ser que siga teniendo deseos fuertes de fumar. <br>  <br>  Una manera de superar estos deseos o impulsos consiste en identificar justificaciones, a medida que se presenten, las cuales son creencias equivocadas que parecen tener sentido en ese momento, pero que no se basan en hechos. Si usted ha tratado de dejar de fumar en el pasado, es probable que reconozca muchas de las siguientes justificaciones:<br>  <br>  Sólo voy a fumarme un cigarrillo para soportar esta situación difícil. <br>  Hoy no es un buen día; voy a dejar de fumar ma?ana.  <br>  éste es mi único vicio. <br>  Realmente, ?cuán da?ino es fumar? Tío Moncho fumó toda su vida y vivió más de 90 a?os. Probablemente, la contaminación ambiental sea tan mala como fumar. <br>  De algo tiene uno que morirse. <br>  La vida no es divertida sin fumar. <br>  <br>  Es probable que usted pueda a?adir alguna más a la lista. Durante los primeros días que pase sin fumar, escriba cualquier justificación errónea que le venga a la mente y reconózcala por lo que es: un mensaje que puede hacer que usted caiga en la trampa de volver a fumar. Las ideas que aparecen a continuación pueden ayudarle a mantener su compromiso de no fumar.<br>  <br>  Absténgase de estar con personas y en los lugares que le tienten a fumar. Más tarde podrá manejarlos con mayor confianza.<br>  <br>  Alterne los hábitos. Por ejemplo, cambie las bebidas alcohólicas o el café por jugos o agua. Tome una ruta diferente para llegar al trabajo, dé un paseo breve, en vez de hacer un receso para tomar café.<br>  <br>  Alternativas. Utilice sustitutos orales, tales como chicle sin azúcar, caramelos macizos, vegetales crudos, tales como trozos de zanahoria o semillas de girasol.<br>  <br>  Actividades. Haga algo que reduzca su ansiedad.  Practique actividades o pasatiempos que le mantengan las manos ocupadas (tejer, carpintería ligera, etc.) y que le ayuden a distraerse del deseo de fumar.  Tome un ba?o con agua caliente, haga ejercicio, lea un libro.<br>  <br>  Respirar profundamente. Cuando usted fumaba, respiraba profundamente al inhalar el humo. Ahora, cuando sienta deseos de fumar, respire profundamente e imagínese que sus pulmones se están llenando de aire fresco y limpio. Recuerde las razones que tuvo para dejar de fumar y los beneficios que obtendrá como ex fumador.<br>  <br>  Posponer. Si siente la necesidad de prender un cigarrillo, pospóngalo. Dígase a sí mismo que tiene que esperar por lo menos diez minutos. A menudo, este truco sencillo le permitirá superar el fuerte deseo de fumar. <br>  <br>  Lo que usted está haciendo no es fácil, por lo que merece una recompensa. Deposite diariamente en un frasco de cristal el dinero que gastaría en cigarrillos y luego cómprese cada semana algo que le dé gusto. Cómprese una revista, salga a cenar, o haga una llamada de larga distancia a un amigo, o bien, ahorre el dinero para comprar algo importante. También puede recompensarse de una forma que no cueste dinero: vaya al parque o a la biblioteca, fomente un nuevo pasatiempo o tome una clase de yoga.<br>  <br>  <br>  Manténgase sin fumar (mantenimiento)<br>  <br>  ?Recuerda la cita de Mark Twain? Quizá usted también haya dejado de fumar muchas veces anteriormente, así que sabe que el mantenerse sin fumar constituye la etapa final y más importante del proceso. Para mantenerse sin fumar, usted puede usar los mismos métodos que utilizó para superar los síntomas que se presentaron mientras dejaba el hábito. Reflexione con anticipación sobre los momentos en que pueda sentir la tentación de fumar, y planifique cómo utilizará sus alternativas y en qué actividades participará para enfrentarse a estas situaciones.<br>  <br>  Más peligrosos, quizá, sean los fuertes deseos inesperados de fumar que a veces se presentan meses (e incluso a?os) después de haber dejado el hábito. Para superarlos sin sufrir una recaída, haga lo siguiente:<br>  <br>  Repase las razones por las cuales usted dejó de fumar y considere todos los beneficios que esto ha representado para su salud, sus finanzas y su familia. <br>  Recuerde que no existe tal cosa como un cigarrillo solo, ni siquiera una inhalada. <br>  Reprima el deseo de fumar. Este desaparecerá, pero no se enga?e usted mismo pensando que puede fumarse un cigarrillo solo. <br>  Evite el alcohol, cuyo consumo reduce sus probabilidades de éxito. <br>  Si se preocupa sobre el incremento de peso, esfuércese por comer sanamente y mantenerse activo(a) con el ejercicio. <br>  <br>  ?Y qué pasaría si fumara? La diferencia entre un solo cigarrillo y una recaída está bajo su control. Usted puede utilizar como excusa un solo cigarrillo para volver a fumar, o  puede analizar en qué falló y renovar su compromiso de mantenerse sin fumar definitivamente.<br>  <br>  Aun si usted tiene una recaída, trate de no desanimarse. Muy pocas personas pueden dejar de fumar definitivamente en el primer intento. De hecho, a la mayoría de las personas le toma varios intentos antes de dejar de fumar. Lo que importa es descubrir lo que le ha ayudado en su intento de dejar de fumar y aquello que no le ha funcionado. Entonces, usted puede usar esta información .|`|4381f7176c47d634b6d69f726e735eeaaa	mirate esta pagina<br>  <br>  <a href="http://dejar-de-fumar.org.es/" rel="nofollow">http://dejar-de-fumar.org.es/</a>|`|5f1d6c54abf79c4425783ea11d54f55faa	Fumé durante 32 a?os ( empecé a los 12 ) y dejé el cigarrillo el 10 de Agosto de 2001, sólo por voluntad y convencimiento personal.

I've found that Gillette's Satin Care shaving gel has helped me quite a bit. Also, always moisturize right after shaving.

AA11883289	Here are just a few points to be aware of:<br>  <br>  1. Was the research done by a credible institution?<br>  2. Was the research performed by a group of qualified researchers?<br>  3. Was it [only] a preliminary study?  Or...<br>  4. Was the research an epidemiological study or an intervention study?  Epidemiological studies examine populations to determine food patterns and health status over a period of time.  Intervention studies examine the effects of a specific modality or intervention on a particular group of subjects and compare the results to a similar group of people not receiving the treatment.  Intervention studies should be randomized and controlled: having an experimental group (actual treatment) and a control group (the placebo).<br>  5. Have other studies, with the same variables, reached the same conclusions?<br>  6. Was the study performed on humans or animals?<br>  7. Was the research performed on a large group of people and was it of sufficient duration?<br>  8. Who financed for the study? Would such a factor slant the outcome? Was the science valid despite the funding source?<br>  9. Was the study published in credible journal that uses experts in the field to review the research results (aka: peer-reviewed). These reviewers serve to point out flaws and can challenge the conclusions before the study is published.<br>  10.

You may think that it's gone, but months later symptoms can come back even if you haven't had sex with anyone at all.  If you think you have it, go get tested and go through another round of treatment.

a9de5d6f7ef1a5bfe94f53274d83b7a3aa	Carbohydrates only have 4 calories per gram and they are the first source of energy that your body uses.  So if you fill up on carbs, like pasta, breads, starches...your body will use them to give you a burst of energy.  If you don't use those calories, they will turn to sugar in your system and leave you feeling groggy and, eventually, heavy.  Think about the typical "beer belly."  <br>  <br>  If you eat mostly protein (meat, eggs and cheeses) and colorful carbohydrates, like leafy greens, beans, carrots, you will stay full for a much longer time.

You don't need a gym membership. Just to start out, try to do as many pushups, situps as you can, although you should shoot for 20 - 30 that's good to do every morning and night. Sometime during the day, go for an hour long run. Just starting out, you won't be able to run the whole thing, so just stay with the run/walk method, run until you're about to collapse, then walk it off, and keep running again. Before running, remember a few things: stay on hard ground, slush, sand, or types of terrain like that will slow you down. Wear light clothing, preferrably cotton, heavy clothing, or certain other types of materials don't breathe WILL slow you down.  Make sure your laces are as tight as possible without cutting off the circulation.

6b4efbc374656358b535d68593892962aa	When a woman has an abortion, the organism living in her (that used her to grow, feed off of, and live in) dies. I believe this is moral because it should be a woman's choice whether she wants to have the baby or not. I think people should mind their own business. People that do not support abortion are the ones in favor of war... is that very moral? Didn't think so.|`|GUOsn4BFaa	Well using Y!Answers as a source is probably not a great idea.  But, maybe we can help you find places to look to for your information.  There are several "true stories" about abortion on the web.  Be prepared to read some very emotional material -  the "cause and effect" stories of some women out there who have had abortions are heart-wrenching to say the least.  Abortion is the termination of a pregnancy and there are different types of "abortion" out there.  Anything from "the morning after pill" (which prevents a fertilized ovum to mature) to "partial birth abortion" (a literal dismemberment of a fetus in order to expell it from the uterus).  Partial birth abortions were out-lawed in the United States during Bush's administration despite the out-cry of women's rights activists throught the nation.  I recently read the story of a woman who had a partial birth abortion out of necessity.  Her baby had a severe birth defect of the spine that would either kill it upon birth or would leave it completely paralized for what would be a short and painful exsistance.  She chose to abort it early in the second trimester as an act of mercy.  She did not want her child to live a life of excrutiating pain - if he even lived at all.  Women have many motivations for abortion but the effect is usually the same.  Pain.  Deep emotional pain.  Whether a woman aborted her baby after one night of carelessness, or to save her own life, or prevent the pain and suffering of her baby after it's birth... it still takes a woman with more strength than most will ever know to live with the emotional torment of loosing that little "light" of life that was growing inside of their bodies.  And, just as a note to anyone reading this thread:  before you judge women who've had abortions by saying that they're just looking for the easy way out or that they are irresponisble and don't want to take responsibility for their actions - listen to their stories.  Why they did what they did and the impact it has had on their lives.<br>  <br>  Search Google for:<br>  Womens Rights<br>  Abortion<br>  Morning After Pill<br>  Partial Birth Abortion<br>  Pregnancy Termination<br>  Contraceptives<br>  Conception<br>  Birth<br>  Fertilization<br>  Gynecology<br>  Obstetrics<br>  Birth Defects and Abnormalities<br>  Planned Parenthood<br>  Adoption<br>  Anything dealing with religous opinion about abortion.<br>  Anything dealing with ethical/moral opinion about abortion.<br>  Anything dealing with the medical opinion about abortion.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Go into your research with an open mind. :)|`|6b34fdfd66358fc4142636b4cdd3ffbcaa	its when you kill a baby before its born. It is moral. Methods are the coat hanger or drain-o.

The one place that is famous for this is planned parent hood.  Alot of states have started making rules about abortions that the fetus must be removed in a certain manner and a certain time frame.  You should google it and find some pictures.  There are acids that injected into the placenta and it burns the baby alive.  there is also a method where the use a suction device and they suction certain parts of the baby out.  It is very painful.  most people belive that it is a womans choice to chose whether or not her child dies.  That its not a baby but a fetus and that they can't feel anything.  Check out the stages of life on a child.  you would be amazed.  I believe that abortion is totally wrong.

I couldn't pass it naturally, so the Dr. went in and sucked it up.  I believe it's a vacuum process.  I was terrified of my actually aborting the fetus, even though sonograms showed no heartbeat.  My parents (Catholic) reassured me (along with lots of prayer) and the week of waiting that I did the right thing for myself.<br>  <br>  I've heard of things put inside that cut up the fetus to make it easier to pull out.  Partial birth abortion is where the Dr. person snaps the head right after the head comes out of the canal.  <br>  <br>  In Animal Biology at Univ. North TX, I was tought that a fetus's heart starts beating at 3 weeks.  Most women don't know they're prego until 4wks.  That's where I feel it's abortion (heart beating).  <br>  <br>  Maybe start with a picture of a beautiful healthy baby & show what it could've ended up like (you can find many pics on the internet).  That would draw attention (maybe not attractive).  It depends on if it's a debate & you're trying to convince to 1 side.  You can bring up the recent presidential candidate potentials positions on it (Clinton, NY ex-mayor,etc).  Why it's such a political argument, what people around the world do to limit population growth, people putting newborns in trash cans, the emotional struggles of giving up for adoption (showing the world you're pregnant for 9mo & the so-called shame of not keeping it), etc.<br>  <br>  What do we, as a general group, have to do to agree on terms?  Why is responsible sex so difficult to accomplish as a whole?  Good luck!|`|f8948dd183381392bbee1597575aca26aa	I have a true story for you:<br>  <br>  A girl, about age 16, went to a Planned Parenthood to get an abortion. She was young, looking forward to college, and her dreams were about to be squashed. She was told that she needed her parent's consent and 350 bucks. Without money or a place to turn, her belly got bigger and she became depressed. She never sought help or medical attention, did drugs, and eventually had the child one day. She rode in a taxi cab to the hospital with a fever. She almost died herself from an infection from not having gone to the hospital earlier (after her water broke), and she was hurting inside.<br>  <br>  In all, that woman wishes that at the age of 16 she was allowed to have an abortion. Society told her she was irresponsible and could not decide for herself; yet she was old enough to have sex. Today, the child and herself are well, bit she is an avid feminist activist and supporter of women's rights. <br>  <br>  On a personal note, I do not believe abortion is wrong. Among many reasons that abortion is legal and always will be, is:<br>  <br>  1. Woman were traditionally subservient to men. In order for women to get ahead, they need to make their own choices about such a financially and emotionally dependent decision.<br>  <br>  2. Women will resort to other harmful means of abortion and probably kill themselves in the process if abortion were illegal.<br>  <br>  3. Not everyone in this great nation believes in a Christian God, or a God at al for that matter. Religion plays a big part in one's beliefs.<br>  <br>  4. Ultimately, freedom of choice is freedom in general. The govt. cannot say what one will and should do to their body; as long as it does not impact another person. A fetus is not a person. Is an egg a chicken salad sandwich?<br>  <br>  Good luck with your research!
AA11883289	The "secret" to any successful weight loss plan is simple: burn more calories than you consume.  Whether this is done via food or exercise or both, that's the formula.  <br>  Sorry, there is no such thing as fat burning soup.<br>  Andy P; Certfied Nutritionist<br>  @ PreventionProof
SX7ol9I5aa	Hydration is ABSOLUTLEY important. If you start to dehydrate  not only do you lose your stamina, but your body will start to shut down; when you sweat you need to continue to replenish your body with water.|`|P9XxUAjhaa	You are basically made out of water.  If you get dehydrated, you get lathargic and start to shut down.  In the worst case, you can die.  It is EXTREMELY Important to keep hydrated...|`|9a1f87f9f78089299f4512e5bb553e7faa	It's absolutely critical. Your body needs water because it needs the hydrogen and oxygen molecules in water.

AA11843893	Not sure.  Have your friend go see a plastic surgeon.  Usually consultations are free and the best options (and prices) would be discussed.  (My guess would be $2,000, though.  Total guess, though.)|`|P9XxUAjhaa	Her insurance might cover at least a portion of it.  As long as it is presented as a problem and not as cosmetic.  She needs to make it sound like it is painful or otherwise causing discomfort, even if emotionally embarrassing.  If it creates a problem, insurance should pay for it...  Otherwise, there are lots of options for fees and payments.  She should do some research.  Try a website called carecredit.com.  You can get financing for medical procedures if the insurance won't pay and she really wants it done.  I financed about $5,000 with them and my payments are only $140 a month...
AA11883289	I’ve helped a number of clients lose weight.  Here are a few pointers I’ve compiled:<br>  <br>  * The key to weight loss is a very simple formula: burn more calories than you consume. It does not matter if you are eating hamburgers, brownies or carrot sticks; if you eat an excessive amount of food/calories, the excess will be turned to fat within hours.  The strategy is to restrict food intake, increasing exercise or both.  Obviously, the latter will accelerate the process.  Once again, it doesn’t not matter whether it's Weight Watchers, Atkins, South Beach Diet or whatever, the formula is the same.  The "fine print" of success, however, is the ability to adhere to a specific plan over a long period of time (i.e. keep the weight off). <br>  <br>  * Generally speaking, it does not matter if it takes you 7 minutes to run a mile or 15 minutes to walk it; the calories expended will be about the same.<br>  <br>  * One of the problems with going on a very rigid diet with a specific goal, is that it's usually a "quick fix" - the dieter attempts to gain a temporary solution to what is typically a chronic problem.  Often, the dieter tries to rigidly restrict eating by, for example, skipping meals or eating salads all day.  But trying not to eat is like trying not to breathe.  After a while, the body and mind rebel and, like a person gasping for air, the dieter loses control and binges.  As a result of the binge, the person feels that he has failed, gives up the diet altogether, eats more to make himself feel better, puts on some weight, feels even worse, gains even more weight, decides to try another restrictive diet, and begins the whole cycle all over again.<br>  <br>  * What is often overlooked, forgotten or dismissed, is that exercise is an essential part of any weight loss plan.  As long as you keep your body conditioned, with a shift of body composition [more] towards lean tissue instead of fat, your metabolism will increase permanently.  The more muscle and lean tissue you have, the more fat you will burn – all day long, even while you are resting.<br>  <br>  * The 10-calorie rule will enable you to lose a pound or two a week while supporting your basal metabolism (internal organ function, nervous system, etc.).  The rule is to allow 10 calories a day for each pound of your present body weight.  As you lose weight, you can gradually adjust calories downward to keep losing at this rate.  Thus, a person who starts at 220 pounds should eat 2,200 calories a day at first.  If your target weight is 180, then slowly reduce your calories to 1,800 a day. <br>  Another more aggressive approach is to institute a deficit of 500 calories a day for seven days (3,500 calories a week). Generally speaking, 3,500 calories equals one pound of body fat.  <br>  <br>  * Excess fat in the abdomen (e.g. men) is a much greater health risk than excess fat around the hips and thighs (e.g. women). The extra abdominal fat crowds the abdominal organs and the proximity to the liver means that, when metabolized, abdominal fat can raise blood cholesterol levels and lower the body's sensitivity to insulin.  Obviously, this sets the stage for diabetes.  Furthermore, the risk for disease rises significantly with a waist circumference of over 40 inches for men and 35 inches for women. <br>  <br>  * Despite what all the infomercials try and sell, there is no such thing as "spot reducing" (aka: losing fat in a particular location).  The fact is, muscles do not "own" the fat which surrounds them.  Since all body fat is shared by all the muscles and organs, spot reducing exercises that work only the flabby areas will not help to reduce the fat in that location.  However, tightening the muscles in trouble spots, through a more-complete exercise program, may improve the appearance of these areas…especially as time progresses.<br>  <br>  * Many dieters experience a temporary plateau after about 3 weeks; some may even notice a slight weight gain.  This is because they have gained water weight temporarily while they are still losing body fat.  The fat they are hoping to lose must be used for energy, which requires (among other elements) water to do this.  Once the water leaves the cells, it enters the blood, then the kidneys and finally into the bladder for excretion.  The signal that the plateau is over is frequent urination.<br>  <br>  Andy P; Certified Nutritionist<br>  @ PreventionProof.com|`|1dpGMWypaa	hey this is aaron from school. you do not need to lose weight. and yes you are strong. ready for lacrosse season.|`|uYAjSKsraa	walk and hour a day....at a fast pace...or run a lot....walking or running always.......and dont eat junk food...and cut out the soda..

95909e7f492a3016a6aab247d3b20594aa	Thyroid Storm <br>  Thyroid storm, which is sudden extreme overactivity of the thyroid gland, is a life-threatening emergency. All of the body functions are accelerated to dangerously high levels. Severe strain on the heart can lead to a lifethreatening irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia), extremely fast pulse, and shock. Thyroid storm may also cause fever, extreme weakness and loss of muscle, restlessness, mood swings, confusion, altered consciousness (even coma), and an enlarged liver with mild JAUNDICE (a yellowish discoloration of the skin and the whites of the eyes). <br>  <br>  <br>  Thyroid storm is generally caused by untreated or inadequately treated hyperthyroidism and can be triggered by infection, injury, surgery, poorly controlled diabetes, pregnancy or labor, discontinuance of thyroid drugs, or other stresses. It is rare in children.<br>  <br>  Therefore; the jaundice related to this Thyroid Storm is not indicative of liver cancer.  You can encourage her to wear sunshades if the jaundice gets severe.<br>  <br>  I hope by this explanation your well -placed anxiety will be allayed. I also went fo high dose of readioactive iodine for my hyperthyroidism.  I shouldn't have tx my hyperthyroidism.  Now, I'm at the other end of the spectrum.  I became a hypo; have  CFS and weight  gain.  A doctor once told me, it's so much easier to Hyperthyroidism rather than hypo.  When I was hyper, I eat like a horse and never gain weight.  Now I'm constantly cold.<br>  <br>  However, as she's in Thyroid Storm; she needs to have this problem addressed.|`|7WKELMsdaa	Please give her this piece of analytical meditation:<br>  <br>  <br>  Psychological Vaccination against Diseases<br>  <br>  <br>  The following analytical meditation will either cure your diseases or give you the ability to live happily with them or do both. Say to yourself: <br>  <br>  I am ill<br>  as most people of the world are.<br>  All have some diseases or other:<br>  either in the body or in the mind.<br>  The body may have diseases for three reasons:<br>  Inheritance<br>  The consequence of karma and<br>  Predetermination or Fate.<br>  The blood that I was made from<br>  had some special capabilities in it<br>  together with some incapabilities.<br>  The capabilities are intellect<br>  power of memory, <br>  physical strength<br>  mental strength, <br>  determination, <br>  gentleness,<br>  leadership, <br>  or one or more other characteristics. From my forefathers I have got honor, wealth, relatives, habit, instinct, etc. These are the inheritances of which I am enjoying the benefits and also will continue to enjoy.<br>  Therefore it is also my responsibility<br>  to enjoy the inconveniences <br>  that I have inherited.<br>  If I do not accept the diseases <br>  of my forefathers<br>  then my children will not accept anything<br>  from my disease, suffering, and responsibilities.<br>  They will only receive my wealth<br>  and throw me into the grave.<br>  <br>  My mind asks me:<br>  Why did my forefathers contact diseases?<br>  Couldn’t it be otherwise?<br>  And I have the answer to this question:<br>  <br>  An individual or group survives only to achieve a goal, a cosmic purpose, which the individual or the nation achieves consciously or unconsciously <br>  by dint of  their capabilities or opportunities <br>  or by way of satisfying the need of the instinct <br>  or reacting to necessity.<br>  But if that individual or nation <br>  does something that may result in their inability to do that duty, then they fall prey to diseases as a consequence of the law of equilibrium.<br>  There arrive in them weakness, inability, and at last control, as a result of which they cannot transgress the limits even if they ignorantly want to, or they simply do not want to do so.<br>  As a result the divine possibility that is hidden in them <br>  remains intact for a predetermined period <br>  and gets transmitted into the next generation<br>  in order to get expressed.<br>  And as long as the tendency to transgress the limits <br>  remains active in them <br>  the diseases also keep hibernating in them<br>  so as to save their worth.<br>  Therefore the diseases that my forefathers have given me <br>  are my real inheritance.<br>  I whole-heartedly embrace all my diseases.<br>  <br>  High blood pressure, diabetes<br>  ? these are not any diseases ?<br>  they are  doctors of humans?<br>  teaching us the rules of self-control.<br>  If somebody did not have these diseases, <br>  then also, in order to be adequately human, <br>  they would have to willingly control themselves <br>  as much as they are doing now against their will.<br>  <br>  It is good to be wise<br>  after being afflicted by trouble.<br>  <br>  Knowledge never forgives humans:<br>  They have to be wise ?<br>  willingly or unwillingly.<br>  If a group of people remains ignorant for a long time,<br>  then a time will come when its progeny <br>  will either deny their unsuccessful,  abominable past<br>  or entomb the ignorance by acquiring a lot of knowledge.<br>  <br>  Man becomes wise only by denying ignorance.<br>  <br>  If an individual or group of people fails to do so<br>  then they are destroyed.<br>  Still that ignorance cannot be in vain<br>  because its history makes others wise.<br>  So it will not be good for me to take any more time to be wise.<br>  Some diseases are created by my own karma.<br>  The Quran as well as any other scripture says that<br>  everything has its measure and limit.<br>  For this reason a transgression in anything<br>  upsets the equilibrium law of existence.<br>  The consequence creates diseases ?<br>  of the body and the mind.<br>  At first what falls prey to diseases is the mind,<br>  though usually the fact eludes our eyes.<br>  Then the society.<br>  And the body at last.<br>  And epidemic!<br>  <br>  The world is woven into the mesh of the law of causality. <br>  If something is supposed to take place <br>  as a result of something else taking place,<br>  it must take place if the latter does.<br>  Any exception is not desirable.<br>  If a cause would not create the expected result,<br>  then we could not desire good results after doing good deeds. <br>  Because we expect good results from good acts, <br>  we do not have the right to escape the consequences of something bad <br>  once we have done it. <br>  <br>  If, for example, I walk about in the rain and get wet as I please <br>  for five hours <br>  and catch cold and have fever, <br>  then there is nothing to be surprised at.<br>  Rather, I should be happy about it,<br>  since nature has not violated her own rules.<br>  If, on the other hand, I do not fall ill,<br>  then that will seem abnormal.<br>  The Quran says that man was created in toil.<br>  Therefore if I want to remain healthy <br>  without doing hard work or taking exercise<br>  then it will sound absurd. <br>  Lack of hard labor and excessive eating<br>  are the causes of diabetes <br>  and high blood pressure.<br>  So I will take hard work as part of life.<br>  <br>  There are some diseases that are predetermined<br>  ─ be that predetermination set a million years or only an hour ago.<br>  Whatever has been preordained for me according to the Universal Wisdom<br>  is undoubtedly good for me.<br>  That is because it is a test for me.<br>  The desire to get a certificate without sitting for the exam <br>  is only a vain desire.<br>  In the race with hurdles, <br>  the hurdles are the most important things to enjoy.<br>  A competition loses its right to be called a competition <br>  when its hurdles are removed.<br>  Whenever I get something as a grace from God<br>  I also get some problems and diseases with it.<br>  That is because in that way God limits my activities <br>  and desires <br>  so that I do not want to touch the sky.<br>  Uncontrolled pleasure may be a cause of destruction.<br>  <br>  Therefore, my Lord knows very well how much happiness <br>  mixed with how much sorrows <br>  will maintain the balance for me.<br>  If I have patience, then, <br>  when there will be no possibility <br>  of my making any further undesirable mistake, <br>  those troubles and diseases will vanish.<br>  <br>  My body cannot tolerate some types of food.<br>  This means that it will be good for me to stay away from them.<br>  So I will control myself in such cases.<br>  If the body could accept whatever the mind wants, <br>  then neither the body nor the mind <br>  would be pleasured <br>  after getting any pleasure.<br>  <br>  There are birds that time and again <br>  eat some pebbles <br>  even if there is no paucity of food.<br>  When cats and dogs eat too much <br>  they sometimes eat some amount of grass <br>  or some sharp leaves of some plants<br>  and vomit willingly.<br>  What it all means is that <br>  sometimes the body needs something <br>  that is not tasty or pleasurable,<br>  and that something that is pleasurable <br>  may have to be discarded if taken too much.<br>  <br>  Diseases do the cleaning in the body <br>  about the things that might be fatal <br>  in the future <br>  even if they  seem to be pleasurable at present.<br>  <br>  The specialty of my personality <br>  lies in my diseases.<br>  However, there is nothing bad in using medicine, <br>  rather, it is better than remaining ill. <br>  Again, curing diseases <br>  and showing the right attitude  to them <br>  are not the same thing. <br>  When our attitude to diseases <br>  becomes correct<br>  we either get rid of all diseases<br>  or are benefited by them more than harmed. <br>  <br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?z=y&EAN=9781581124842&itm=4"

AA11405003	First of all, your details are hard to read.<br>  <br>  How do women with PCOS  loose weight?<br>  <br>  The sad truth is that it is just like most any woman.  The news that you are looking for though is this:  STAY away from bad carbs.  Check the glycemic index for carbohydrates.  Donuts are bad carbs and have bad glycemic levels.  Stay away from carbs with high glycemic levels.<br>  <br>  The weight gain causes your PCOS to worsen.   Because the PCOS has worsened, you will gain more weight..  This is a yo-yo cause and effect situation.  This also hampers fertility.<br>  <br>  Going to the gym is great.  Remember that muscles have more weight than fat.

It is normal to have more discharge before your period, especially when you are on birth control, because of the increase in hormones (estrogen) from taking the pill.|`|hxDWLS1Faa	I would def call my gyno that prescribed that to you and ask them, you might have adapted some allergy or immunity to it and might need to change pills.

AA11933942	If you write me I will share my Daughters photo's. She had upper jaw surgery.|`|0e4387b2094405dfc19dbc597cf0998aaa	This medical people studied in medical schools I think they know what they are doing, just take a second opinion and go for it.It is sure corrective measures also check the reputation of the dental clinic It makes a difference.Good luck it will sure boost your self confidence to correct your smile.|`|KlYkixRGaa	Hi, I have to be honest, and it's probably not the response you really want to hear. I had this surgery done 9 months ago. I had my upper jaw cut and widened and slid forward to correct a cross-bite and under-bite; then i got my bottom jaw and chin cut and moved around as well. <br>  I had some complications with my surgery and lost gum all around my teeth on my upper jaw (the front 4 teeth) and now I am going to lose my canine tooth. I am in a lot of pain with my upper pallet and sinuses (still at nine months later) I have a pin in my chin which snags my chin tissue and hurts and to top it off i keep getting ear infections because when they moved my upper jaw they may have hit the Eustation tubes of my ears so my ears dont drain fluid properly. <br>  <br>  I know a lot of people who have had this operation done very successfully; but if it were up to me and life was like Microsoft word wiht the "undo button" I would hit Undo a million times over. I just hope God makes my pain go away. i still have to get root canals done on several teeth as their nerves were severed during the surgery. <br>  <br>  My advice to you is if you are doing this because of aesthetic reason. PLEASE...PLEASE...PLEASE don't have it done, unless people really notice you have  afacial deformity...otherwise if you are in pain ...i suppose it's worth taking the gamble. I will pray for you. I am sure you will be fine...but it's just like any surgery even tonscils ...there are horror stories for everything. I just pray mine can be fixed and yours goes successfully...Good luck to you and may God Bless.....|`|ee847a7785b49b3affe437e258496473aa	Actually, I will be having upper jaw surgery in 4 days from now.  I just came back from the final consultation with the surgeon and feel pretty good about it.  All the nurses keep saying that I will look very different and that I will look so good.  I think that I look good now but I don't see my profile that often and that is what will change the most.  Seeing pics of my profile at the doctor's office, I guess I need it.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I am excited about having a good bite so that I can actually chew food correctly.  I am excited about a great smile since I currently have an underbite and since learning that I needed surgery, have been self-concious about my smile.  I am also very excited about my change in profile.  My midface is kind of sunken in I guess and it is noticeable in my profile.  This will all chnage in a few days.<br>  <br>  I am not concerned about pain.  I am not looking forward to being uncomfortable but after the surgery, I know that each day I will feel better and better.  I know it will be a small price to pay for the results.<br>  <br>  I think the worst part of the whole experience for me will have been the waiting for the operation to be over with.  I had braces put on over a year ago and ever since then, nurses and doctors and orthodontists have been telling me how different and great I am going to look.  While this got me excited about the future, it made me feel more self-conscious about the way I looked presently and made me feel like there was something wrong with me that needed to be fixed.  So I lost a little confidence for a while but now that the operation is happening so soon, I realize that it is worth it.  Hopefully you won't feel self-conscious about yourself in the meantime like I did.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

You are 5'9 so that would still be a healthy weight for you and you'd look really good. I wouldn't recommend losing 70 pounds, that would make you look anorexic. I wouldn't lose more than 30 or 40 pounds. If you're already working out, maybe try focusing exercise on certain parts. Also if you drink any soda, you should try to cut it, that would help alot. You should lose whatever amount is going to make you happy. That's what is most important.|`|izD4DkVdaa	I'm trying to lose weight too and it's sooo hard.

Yo se que nosotros aveces la juventud lo que hace es jugar con el sexo pero si no te protejes podrias terminar con mucha experiencia pero enfermo de alguna enfermedad de trasmision sexual. Mi consejo es que esperes a que llegue ese amor pues unas chikas que se lo cuentan todo no valen la pena, las que no sirven son ellas, aprende a confiar en ti y deja que tu cita de amor sea por amor no por diversion y veras que seras un esperto sin darte cuenta, saludos y exito pues la suerte viens aveces...
