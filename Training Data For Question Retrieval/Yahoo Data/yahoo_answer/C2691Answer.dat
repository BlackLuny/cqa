G0KKfXMUaa	Hm. Well if you jump some, but do not yet have the confidence, don't enter any minor jumping shows yet.<br>  <br>  I would go to a small, local, easy going show where you can get the hang of it. Just enter some fun walk/trot/pole classes. Or you could enter some walk/trot/canter classes depending on how strong your canter is.<br>  <br>  Once you go through this and have a fun, good experience, confidence gets easier to have. It'll be really fun and worth it =)<br>  <br>  Just remember to get to the show the day before so that you can practice and get used to the show grounds.|`|Xobbmd7Saa	Start off with a nice, noncompetitive schooling show in your area without any rated classes. I would start out doing flat classes such as walk/trot or beginner on the flat if they have it. Hold off on doing jumps until you get the hang of showing and until you can jump a range of courses in the arena with your coach at home. You should enlist your coach to help you in this so tell him or her that you want to show and they will help you.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	I would suggest finding a low key schooling show in your area. Before you go to compete, bring your horse for the day and just hang out. Lead him around, show him everything, let him get accustomed to the new environment without stressing the both of you out by having to get ready for a class. Go for a little ride around the grounds... just make it a fun, enjoyable day. <br>  <br>  The next time you will have a better idea of what is expected of you and it won't be such a shock for your horse. I would recommend just going in a few classes... if this is your first show and his too, then why not try two walk/trot classes and if he is being really good a walk/trot/canter? The worst thing you can do is go in over your head and get both yourself and your horse overwhelmed. You want this to be a positive experience for him. Horse shows should be fun, not scary! I have been riding and showing for sixteen years. I recently bought an OTTB and this past summer was his first show season. I brought him all over the place before I even entered him in a single class... and for the first half of the show season we did strictly walk trot to boost his confidence. There is nothing wrong with that!! <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck & have fun!|`|8i73lpwgaa	If you aren't a member already, think about joining a 4-H or a pony club. They usually have shows every other weekend that are low-key and don't really count for much. Or just regular schooling shows. <br>  <br>  To get him used to shows, I'd take him and lead him around and show him that it's a new enviornment and theres nothing to be afraid of. As most horses, they'll probably get really hyper and want to smell every smell and what not. See how he is. (: If you want, you can even try schooling him. <br>  <br>  As for showing in actual classes, your best bet would be Pleasure or Equitation. Pleasure is about how willing your horse is, and eq. is basically your posture and seat. <br>  <br>  Hunters can get a bit more competitve, so... xD But hunters is more about the horse and how he goes over jumps. <br>  <br>  I'd also try beginners, if you can make the age cut off.|`|jiWHDyS5aa	well if your under 19...u can show in 4-h fun shows. they are about as laid back as it gets. its supposed to be a fun learning exp. many times, judges will give u helpful tips and pointers. they also have fun classes like egg n spoon, red light green light and ride-a-buck. once your confortable with fun shows, 4-h also has high levels too. u can go to your local district horse show. it is a qualifying show for state and eventually regionals. if u think ur ready for that...its a great thing to get into.<br>  <br>  if ur an adult, u may want to get to know a stable that has their in school shows, which are often laid back. im sure they would welcome u. <br>  <br>  Good luck showing!|`|MInCz0Keaa	flat work for your 1st couple shows at a local schooling show|`|WJJMZ9IQaa	You could start out in your local "C" circuit.|`|3PamELMvaa	If you stable him and ride at a riding school, I'd suggest you join a few in-house competitions there. That way he will get used to all the other horses, spectators and general show setting while being in a familiar place where he is comfortable. Don't be ashamed to start with the basics. If you are not confident, then you should only enroll in events that you feel confident in, even if they are below your ability.

It doesn't make any sense to me. (sorry) I'd contact another reputable vet.  If anything to ease my mind for my pet.
LAXxaxAZaa	I'm going to say the same thing I said to someone who posted the same question.<br>  <br>  <br>  You really need to measure him. My 15.1hh mare wears a 68 and my 13.3hh gelding wears a 72. They'll surprise you.<br>  <br>  Take a measuring tape and put one end in the middle of his chest and the other end on the top of his tail. However many inches that is will be his size.|`|AA10986942	you need to measure your horse from the center of his chest across his side and to the closest side of his tail....This will give you the correct measurement.  A easy way to do it if you dont have a cloth measure tape is to use a lead line to measure, mark it and then just measure the lead line with a metal tape or a yard stick.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	measure from the middle of his chest to the middle of his tail.

It costed around $40 but it was worth it. He holds it and plays with it plus it only has to be fed once every two weeks as a baby and once a week as an adult.

133a80b8f446ced791ae790df571f049aa	Pretty much anywhere... it depends on the dog.  You may find a trained dog on craigslist or in an animal shelter, it just depends on the individual dog.  I know at most shelters they make sure the dog is at least leash trained and housebroken.

8i73lpwgaa	Maybe Gigolo isn't used to jumping that low and/or thinks the jumps look larger? Each horse/pony has a different jump, and it'll probably take some getting used to. I feel the same way you do with Gigolo and the horse I'm riding. He jumps WAY too big or perfectly, and it's impossible to tell. I loose my balance, but rarely fall off. <br>  <br>  Maybe when approaching the jump, do some half halts. Or take him up to the jump in a trot. He might need to just have some time to realize that he's not in the show ring anymore and he can relax.|`|EghHVkHEaa	When i got my first horse she was totally a "made" horse with a been there done that record. She normally jumped like 4'6 or something - at the time i was only jumping like 2'6 but whenever we jumped she would always take off a stride before and jump it like it was a 5 ft oxer. I think its all about them realizing that this jump is smaller and you don't have to jump that high. After awhile of jumping 2'6 courses she was finally like "oh okay".|`|JFuVm9k5aa	it has nothing to do with his extensive training. i had a grand prix horse and when juming him over smaller stuff he still respects my aids and "waits" for me. it is rider error when a horse is taking off so early. you need to sit back and bring your horse up between your hands and legs where you can have control. you want "energy" but you want it in shorter, bouncier strides so the horse can propel itself over the jump and lift its withers and hind end properly. <br>  i would jump him over a small X over and over agin until it got dull in his head. it sounds to me like rider error but i am sure after having time off from the show circuit he may just be a little excited. so if you get ihm "bored" with it and jump him in a circle oer a jump he should get used to it again. you could also set the jumps up igher and get him to back himself off. but if you are not capeable...dont.<br>  <br>  sounds to me the horse just has a stong jump and you cannot handle it yet and you cannot keep him in control.<br>  <br>  good luck.
9kceDOTraa	Fish being moved from tank to tank is a stressful process which will effect the coloring on the fish.  Color should become more normal in time, but that's not what's concerning me here.<br>  <br>  How long you plan on keeping this Oscar in a 10 gallon tank?  A proper tank for a single Oscar is no less then a 55 gallon tank.  Oscars grow rapidly and it's not going to be long before that tiny 10 gallon tank becomes too small for it.  As well too, this "other cichlid" what is it?|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	pale color is due to poor water or if the water is too cold. Check your ammonia level if it is high thats your problem.  I bet it is because those fish are very messy and produce lots of waste and should NEVER be kepts in a 10 Gal tank unless being treated for an illness.<br>  <br>  If you do not plan on getting a larger thank for your fish you should bring the fish back.  <br>  <br>  Is your tank cycled?|`|dE5fs9yzaa	He's probably still stressed. have you ever moved?

I had a 1 pump BB pistol (harmless at a far distance).  I shot around the cats (not at them directly) and they would jump about 3 feet in the air then take off.  I only do it for a couple times a month.  Solved the problem and I didn't have to leave my house or call animal control.|`|EKd4Ew19aa	Yes, if a cat is meowing outside his window, your friend should at least go up to the cat and shoo it away.|`|1tOr2qLAaa	Well if it turns out to be the neighbor cat, then it might cause problems. Perhaps she should check around the neighborhood to find out if it belongs to anyone.  If not you usually can get a cage from the SPCA if it is a feral cat and trap it and take it to the SPCA.|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	ignore the BB pistol suggestion.  Scaring the cat is just as abusive as anything else.<br>  <br>  It is silly to call the SPCA right now.  Your friend should ask his neighbors if the cat belongs to them.  If a stray or dropped off by someone then call the SPCA.  Who knows if it is a stray then maybe one of neighbors will be interested enough to take him in as their own.
6ae0aSbvaa	I have heard of them and even seen a few.  My 11 year Malinois who just retired has floppy ears also.  They weren't always that way though.  About a year and a half ago his ears started filling up with blood, very similar to the mma fighters who have cauliflower ears.  They drained them several times but he has so much scar tissue built up in them that they flop over now.  Looking at him, you almost can't take him seriously.|`|EWXzNyk8aa	Some German Shepherds ears stay floppy, but most (as the standard says) have their ears up straight, although it takes awhile, because when they are puppies their ears are up down up down up down :) I have never seen a German Shepherd police dog with floppy ears though.|`|rh4MS9Rvaa	yes the one that bit me last weak did have one floppy ear. lol just a joke|`|GSf09ALBaa	Yes.

Info on care, handling, feed, health, etc.|`|zZrKhn9eaa	Great pets.... if you don't mind the mischief. They are very cute and sweet pets. But anything they can get into, they will. And they can get into smaller spaces than you might think. They will even hide your stuff. But if you do your research and take great care of it, a ferret can be a really fun pet. Another thing to consider is how much time you can spend with your ferret. They can get very lonely if they don't have a playmate so some might consider a second furry friend. And do you have any other pets? A big dog may not appreciate you bringing something that looks similar to a squirrel back home.<br>  If you really are a true animal lover, them I'm sure you'll make the right choice. And if/when you get a ferret you'll see how much fun they are :)|`|RUIceUBbaa	My family owns 6 ferrets so I can say they make great pets.  But with a great pet comes great responsibility.  They do not live as long as a typical dog does and by the time they reach 4 or 5 years old they can develop very serious health issues.  Insulnoma, adrenal disease, cancer, many different disorders.  My sister has lost 3 ferts, one to kidney failure due to lack of treatment from previous owners, one from adrenal disease where it lost all of its fur, and a third recently to cancer.  They may be cute, but their vet bills are not!<br>  <br>  I would recommend A LOT of research before looking in to owning a fert.  Take a lot of work, a lot of attention, and a lot of love.  The best book is Ferrets for Dummies, which is a bible to my sister.<br>  <br>  As far as odor is concerned...every living creature has a distinct odor...we may stink to ferrets, they smell normal to them.  They do have a distinct smell, but as long as the cage is maintained and the litterbox is cleaned on a regular basis, you should have no problem with the smells.<br>  <br>  Avoid wood shavings with ferrets...This can cause upper respiratory infections.  Rather use only soft bedding and scrap clothing that they can snuggle in.<br>  <br>  As far as litter...AVOID CAT LITTER AT ALL COSTS!!!  They can easily injest this and cause intestinal blockage....my sister uses Marshall Farm or Yesterday's News ferret litter.<br>  <br>  If you decide to get a fert, be sure to find a good fert veterinarian and get him/her checked out and made sure he/she is healthy.<br>  <br>  BTW, if you decide you want a fert, there are plenty in shelters right now that are in dire need of homes and many of them do have great temperments, you can ask around at someone who has gotten one...three of ours were adopted from the Ferret and Dove Sanctuary in Flordia.<br>  <br>  GL|`|p82sIbAAaa	I personally wouldn't recommend getting a ferret. They require so much attention and care. Plus, I have never smelled anything so bad! A girl in my class was playing with one of my teacher's ferrets, and it pooped and peed all over her and her stuff. They are gross and are only for proper and experienced pet owners who really really like them.<br>  Hope it helps!<br>  P.S. cats are WAY easier!|`|FKqd96Biaa	I had 6 ferrets at one time and a person with depression like I do will tell you that somedays they made my day brighter.

Sometimes an oddball will pop up in the bunch that reverts back to those old breeds, especially if you breed the rabbits fairly closely to one another.  Also, sometimes in rabbits a mutation will occur, creating a new trait.

sgr01OCkaa	Hi I got the dizziness thing pretty bad when I was about your age too, I would get dizzy, not see or hear anything, fall over and all sorts. One time it happened to me and when I recovered my senses I was basically sitting in my sisters lap on the floor and she was screaming at me to get off, and i couldn't hear or see any of it while it was happening. I asked my doctor about it and he said that it was something to do with blood pressure. It could also be that you have had a growth spurt. I didn't do anything for it and it eventually got better over time. It still happens mildly to me now but not so bad that I cant hear and am generally able to keep myself upright. as for the stomach pains, I think you really should go and see a doctor about it and also mention the dizzy thing too, you could have it worse than me etc and may need to do something about it. If your mum thinks the pain  has something to do with drinking milk then I would suggest stop all dairy intake for a week and see if you still get the pains, it could be that you are dairy intolerant.<br>  hope this helps but I really think you should go to the doctor too|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Um.... wrong category.|`|rTSwouqXaa	I get that way too sometimes. I normally stop drinking about that time.|`|DoS1Ow2jaa	i think you need to go back to your doctor straight away and i would also like to know why your mum is not taking this illness more seriously? <br>  <br>  You need blood test done and everything.... i would be asking your mum to take you back to the doctor as soon as possible. not to scare u but if it is something serious like cancer your just letting it get worse by not doing something about it.|`|EghHVkHEaa	Well this is in the horse section, but when you get up right away after being in a laying or sitting down position you'll get lightheaded because all the blood is flowing down again. Just drink a lot of water and don't get up as fast anymore.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	Why is this in horses?|`|sbB0TpGXaa	I would also guess that you are underweight.  My guess would be either low blood sugar or low blood pressure.  Both will cause the symptoms you mentioned.  If you are underweight and tall it increases the likelihood of low blood pressure.  Your brain may not be getting enough blood.<br>  <br>  If you are eating properly your stomach will hurt, especially when food hits it.  I believe this is the cause of your stomach aches.  You may be lactose sensitive and that will be worsened by your condition and worsen the stomach aches.  Try drinking enough juice or gator aide to keep yourself hydrated.  Dehydration can cause headaches and your stomach aches may be preventing you from taking in enough water.  The gator aid and juice (especially juice) will help give some sugar which will boost your blood sugar and help alleviate the dizziness even if it is from low blood pressure.<br>  <br>  It goes without saying you need to go back to the doctor ASAP.|`|ff42beaeb7a8ee5d3b32dd2655c08c36aa	wrong category.<br>  stay away frommilk products.<br>  the dizziness might be from low blood pressure, or from being anemic.<br>  didnt your doc do anything?|`|8i73lpwgaa	I thought this would be from a riding accident, but it seems that its not...? You're in the wrong category.<br>  <br>  Drink more water and stand up slower.|`|en208Kfoaa	I have the same problem. It's cause you stand up too quickly and you need to drink more water|`|h3LXI1Wvaa	why is this in the horse section? haha (:|`|277f88461e1df8f316c52c480977aaa6aa	lol, why is this in horses.  i'm not a dr. so i could be wrong, and prolly am.  but it wouldn't hurt to take  mild acid reducers.  you could have an ulcer which is bleeding which could make you dizzy, but it's not likely that i'm right, you really need to get checked out. ...ok  where on your tmmy does it hurt, this might sound gross, but what does your poo look like?  if it's redish, maroon, tarry, or black, and foul smelling and you haven't taken pepto, you could have internal bleeding and need to be seen immediately.  if you do have any of the above and still have trouble convincing your mother, show her the toilet before you flush.  good luck.|`|Nhje1U06aa	okay well your not a dog  or cat :) <br>   It happens to me occasionally but I'm on  a drug that dizziness is a side effect. <br>  How is   your diet ??? Do you eat enough red meat  <br>   i'm not trying to be rude but do you menstruate  ?  It may be an  anemic thing -<br>  write a journal of what you eat and when you get your spells you may be able to pin point the trigger- cheese  sugar etc.... <br>    Go to your doctor get him to take some blood tests    and stick up for yourself don't let them brush you off as a silly kid  - You are old enough to know your body!  Hope you get better!|`|SzW9GmRsaa	The dizziness and black spots is from what's called postural hypotension - your blood pressure drops when you stand up.  It's fairly common and nothing major to worry about but you should be drinking more to make sure there's enough blood going round your body so it doesn't all fall to your feet when you stand up.<br>  <br>  Headaches will likely be down to dehydration - again you need to be drinking more.  Stomach aches could be a lot of things but if you're not drinking enough you're probably getting indigestion.<br>  <br>  You should be drinking at least 2 litres of clear liquid a day (coke and milk don't count!) but preferably nearer 3.

B6zl0AJDaa	A navicular horse is NOT an ideal horse for your first horse to be honest.  Pass him by and wait, your horse will eventually show up and it will be sound and you'll spend hours together.<br>  <br>  You can be kind to him, brush him, give him TLC until he goes, but do NOT buy him.|`|IMPvzBk1aa	Unless you have the funds to support the horse, and are willing to do it whether or not the horse is ridable, then it's a bad idea.  This kind of thing can run into quite a bit of money in order to keep the horse comfortable even just as a pasture pet if the condition is as bad as it sounds.  Without a better diagnosis from a vet equipped to xray and ultrasound, it may or may not be 100% accurate.  But in order to  pursue more diagnostic testing, there are costs involved.<br>  I understand your feelings about this horse, and I would also be concerned with who may end up taking him.  But I think it boils down to an issue of funds, and whether or not you can afford to rescue him. him.|`|an1L8njXaa	the kindest thing for this horse would be to have it PTS. i cant believe how irrisponsible your barn owner is being by passing on a horse with major medical issues.<br>  So very few people have the money to pay for an unridable horse that the poor horse is likely to end up going for meat or ending up starving and in an auction somewhere buted up to the eyeballs so it looks sound.<br>  <br>  Navicular can be very painful for a horse perticularly in its later stages, do the horse a favor and dont let it get to those stages.|`|0rRkRAnJaa	He will cost a fortune to keep - a healthy horse costs a lot, a horse with navicular will cost even more. If his navicular is so bad that he can't be ridden, he is only suitable for a companion horse (only if he is comfortable). <br>  Just groom him until he goes - if your barn owner has even half a heart he will not let him go to someone awful.|`|6EUbvmfHaa	To be honest I think you should have him put to sleep. I know how hard it is when you love them so much! I had to have my pony put to sleep because she broke multiple bones. It will be very sad to let this wonderful horse go away for a long time. George will be miserable not doing anything and just being pretty much lame for the rest of his life. My pony was pretty spirited and to be locked in a stall for the of her life, would kill her. She did hate being in a stall. So the best you can do for this horse is to have a vet put him to sleep. It's going to hurt for a while. But one day you will get to ride in the heavens with him.|`|N2jvxYPcaa	The term "navicular" has several meanings and several causes. Many of the horses diagnosed with navicular are going to be choronically lame, in pain and have their disease progress.<br>  On the other hand, other horses are diagnosed with navicular, but with proper treatment end up drastically improving and being rideable.<br>  The thing is - in your discription this horse was diagnosed by a farrier. That means nothing. Unless the farrier had x-rays, and all the skills of a vet you only have a single person's guess what is wrong with him. Before you have any idea if he is treatable, if he actually has true navicular, and if he will get worse or better you need to have him totally vetted at a good equine vet's place. Expect to pay several hundred dollars for these test, it could easily be much higher than that even if he requires a few x-rays. <br>  Next I would have a good barefoot farrier access him. Often horses that are diagnosed with navicular can be helped by having their shoes removed, corrective trims and padding boots. You can expect to pay a couple of hundred dollars for an accessment by a barefoot farrier, and probably a couple hundred more for the padded boots.<br>  Next, this horse probably will require at the very least a few months of rest time in a turnout situation. Even if he can be rode in the future, he is going to need some recovery time. I don't know what the cost of pasture turn-out bording is in your area, but let's estimate about $100 month (I am probably grossly under estimating, it could be $250 or more)<br>  Then the barefoot farrier will need to come out frequently, perhaps every 4 weeks at first. You will need to have him checked again at least once by a vet. He may need some special medication for pain. I expect the vet/farrier bills for the next six months to be about $750.<br>  If you are lucky, the horse could be drastically improved or even good enough to ride at that point in time. On the other hand, he may be unchanged, or even worse.<br>  I'm not trying to be harsh, but if you count up the possible costs I have projected it could very easily cost you $2000 to have him ready for light riding. I was careful to no over estimate anything, and in fact have probably under estimated costs. I don't think it would be surprising if it cost you almost double to have him really properly treated.<br>  Now you see why a "free" horse often isn't a free horse.<br>  I might very well invest this money into a horse I already owned, knew and had trained. This is because I not only would have an emotional relationship to the horse, but because I would truly know his temperment and training, and know whether he was worth the investment of money or not. I would also know his past soundness history and know if he had various other problems as well. <br>  In your case you don't know what this horse's other health or soundness issues are. He may have other problems. (I really doubt he was donated for free to the riding school if they thought they could get money for him. If the first owner thought he was worthless, what makes you think they were wrong?) Also, you don't know how well trained this horse is, or what his actual temperment is. You may invest $2000 in him, and discover that once he's sound he's overly high strung, goofy, poorly trained or bad mannered.<br>  I would advise you to invest your money in a horse without all these issues, one you can truly access properly. If the stable doesn't want to take the chance of spending alot of money on this horse to diagnose him, then they should have him humanely put down by a vet. The last owners were actually incredibly cruel. They knew he had huge problems, otherwise they wouldn't have given him away. They basically were too chicken to do what was best for him, so passed him to someone else to see if they would do the right thing.<br>  That is basically a form of animal abuse.|`|penuzN8jaa	well, if you have time, lots of money and a place for him, then yes!! Also, It might be a good idea for you to buy another horse to ride and keep George company!<br>  Good luck :P<br>  x|`|psNR7hDJaa	I think putting him to sleep would be the best. <br>  <br>  My friend had a horse who had navicular. But now the horse is completely sound. So they think it was something else before that. They aren't sure but he is sound now so yeah...|`|BI1GbIZUaa	If he is comfortable then there's nothing wrong with taking him. Make sure you can afford to keep him, he would probably be happiest on 24/7 turnout. Be prepared that he will have to be put to sleep at some point. Decide on how much you are willing to spend to make him comfortable, when he's gone over that point then you'll have to let him go. I know what it's like to fall in love with a horse who isn't always rideable. You can gain a lot of experience from owning a horse and grooming is very satisfying.|`|n2dUmfcQaa	you might love him, but to be honest, you could get a completely healthy horse for free. he will cost you tons of money, i will break in down,<br>  <br>  board, or land!<br>  feed,<br>  vet bills, tons,<br>  gelding so his man part need to be cleaned,<br>  hoofs done,<br>   <br>   theses are just some things you should think about! here is a web site you can look at! they have some free horses<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.horsetopia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsetopia.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.equinehits.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.equinehits.com/</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps|`|yQFdBj3haa	I wouldn't take him believe me it will cost you so much money and heartbreak in the long run and navicular can be very unpredictable - they can be ok one minute and bad the next. I've seen what it can do. <br>  <br>  My friends bought a 12 year old TB mare in August. She was really quiet for a TB and she was perfect for her in every way. She paid a lot for her as well. Anyways she was really attached to the mare. She went on holiday for one week in September and I was looking after her while my friend was away. She had her checked out by the vet and farrier just before she went away. Turns out the mare had navicular but it wasn't serious at the time it was at the beginning stages so the farrier said if my friend is lucky the mare will be able to be worked as much as she wanted for 2 - 3 years before slowing down because of the navicular. My friend was happy because she wanted to foal her anyways in 2 - 3 years. Anyways she went on holiday on wednesday. By sunday the mare got ill came down with navicular, she was in so much pain she couldn't eat, drink and she had colic overnight. Through the colic and the pain of the navicular she twisted her gut and wouldn't pass anything. She wanted to roll all of the time and she was in an awful state. On monday she had to be put to sleep because of the pain she was in. <br>  <br>  So no you shouldn't get him because believe me it's an unpredictable disease and it can come and go but it's very serious. Not only can it cost a lot of money and a lot of pain and suffering to the horse but it will cause you heartbreak and it's not worth it. My friend had that mare for 6 weeks, that's how quickly it can come on. So my advice to you is no don't take him even if it is for free.|`|yv91Wl3Zaa	A farrier is not a reliable source when diagnosing navicular syndrome. So it's very possible that he might not have navicular syndrome at all. I would recommend that you arrange a pre-purchase exam with a reputable veterinarian with the basis of investigating this issue. Navicular syndrome has been claimed by some veterinarians to be over diagnosed and as a result Navicular syndrome has gained a reputation of being feared. Navicular syndrome can be defined as a detioration of the navicular bone which is between the coffin bone and the fetlock bone which can over time result in pain, if left untreated. Navicular syndrome can only be diagnosed if the horse feels any pain in the heel area, these can be determined with nerve blocks and the x-rays of the heel area show divets in the Navicular bone. Horses can have x-rays with those divets and still be perfectly sound and ridable. Navicular also usually occurs in both feet, although one my show signs earlier, eventually both of the feet will be affected.<br>  <br>  As for shoeing, I personally prefer not to use eggbars or pads, they lift up the horses heel which gives them a false belief that the pain is relieved. My farrier has been told at conventions that horses with a certain kind of corrective shoeing and almost spread shoes are less likely to develop the syndrome because of the even distribution of the weight. Some horses require isxopurine, however, those horses a usually far along the development of the syndrome and at that time they can be considered to have navicular syndrome. Some horses don't require shoes at all and simply need a good trim to correct the problem.<br>  <br>  As for money, it is not as expensive as someone just described. My mare has shoes that my farrier molds to her feet and he costs $160, a trimmer usually costs about $80 or even less. Also, she mentioned pads, as I said just above, good farriers have come up with the idea that pads are actually causing damage and simply masking the pain instead of doing good.<br>  <br>  George could easily be riddable and it is possible that he will do just fine with light work. But it is best that a pre-purchase exam with a notable vet, do not use the same vet that the barn owner uses, even if the horse did not have anything seriously wrong, the vet used by the owner of the horse could easily just say that he's fine without really investigating.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope that everything works out with you and George.
iVQULHqYaa	I hope that you can find a way of arranging this. The thought of dying before my dog is my greatest fear. She is now ten and before I bought her I arranged three guardians for her and each one of them agreed to take her if I pre decease her. Unknown to them, I had made financial provision in my Will for my dog. One of the guardians is now too ill, another has retired early and spends about twenty four weeks of the year abroad and the other has died. <br>  My dog has a happy life, sleeps in my bedroom, plays with me in a large fenced garden, goes for long walks and still participates in dog sports. Unfortunately she has had more health problems than all of my other dogs put together. At present she is in remission from Furunculosis and stress can bring this on again. Last year she was attacked by another dog and this problem reoccurred. Some time ago the vet diagnosed “age related incontinence” thankfully he was wrong and this problem has ceased.  She has had other health problems including arthritis thankfully she is now well and the arthritis is under control. Imagine anyone taking on and old dog who could get Furunculosis again, she would suffer if she was not helped to cope with this. Even without health problems any dog will find it difficult to cope if their owner dies.<br>  <br>  Dogs are more clingy when one lives alone. When their owners die they suffer and often die shortly afterwards. Several years ago, I contacted The Cinnamon Trust and offered to take in dogs who were left alone when their owner died, I was thinking about making arrangements with them for my dog and said that I was willing and able to cope with a rescue from them.  I asked them when they wanted to do a “home check” and I was told that if I was good enough to offer a home to a dog that this was unnecessary. I was disgusted; consequently I have not gone down that route for my dog.<br>  <br>  Before I became familiar with the dog questions and answers on Yahoo I made the decision that my dog should be PTS when I die. This is because I love her and the thought of her going into a rescue home appals me. She would be kept for about two weeks, possibly be adopted by a nutter or PTS. I don’t go on holiday because I would hate to leave any dog in a kennel; this stresses even a young dog.  <br>  <br>  Now after reading so many stupid questions and answers from people who do not understand dogs I am sure that I have made the right decision. There are other friends who could take my dog, however some of them take long holidays, do not have gardens and they do not have the experience of coping with dogs. <br>  <br>  Hopefully I will be able to love and cherish her until the end of her life.|`|AA11097657	I understand how you feel.

I also have a baby scale and weigh all my cats once per month to keep an eye on who needs what insofar as food goes.<br>  <br>  If the bowel movement was normal, I would just be concerned about the brown goo around his mouth and take him in for a check-up - tell them about the brown goo around the mouth and they may get you right in.  Hyperthyroid cats need to be checked pretty regularly anyways to make sure they're still on the right dose.  He also may have gotten into something (chocolate?  I hope not?) and that's what the goo is about - just a possibility.<br>  <br>  p.s.  I note that some people truly do not read thoroughly a person's question and come up with some of the most incompassionate responses!

Not many people around here seem to do that :/  Even though 2 gallon is pretty small for a gravel siphon, you might still want to get one.  I'm not sure how small they come but that would work for cleaning old food and waste off the bottom.  That's easier than scooping water anyway, just siphon into a small bucket.  You only need to clean the tank sides and silk plants if it looks dirty or there's some algae that bothers you.  You don't need to do more thorough cleanings as long as you keep up with the small water changes.  <br>  <a href="http://www.firsttankguide.net/siphon.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.firsttankguide.net/siphon.php</a><br>  <a href="http://cichlidresearch.com/gifs/simpleaquarium/gravel_siphon_DSC_4803.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cichlidresearch.com/gifs/simpleaq...</a>|`|0gjWuAXZaa	ok to get the old water out you should buy a siphon. this will get the water, poop, and uneaten food out of the bottom of the tank. it also wont suck up any gravel. you should only change 20% of the water once a week. yes if you notice any algae on the sides of the tank then just wipe it off with a sponge and you can get a silk or plastic plant for decoration. you could also put some pretty rocks or shells in it to make it look even nicer.<br>  that is about it. it isnt very hard to keep a betta. good luck :)|`|ATgG6RgIaa	I change 30% of the tank water every week. There is bound to be evaporation, so take it out 30% of whats there and top off the tank. They do sell very small gravel vacs. At 2 gallons you want the smallest.Use this to clean aprox. 1/5 or less, of the gravel filter bed at each water change. This is removing the so called dirt. Now do not do the gravel vac. until the tank has cycled. You need to look that up. Ammoniea to nitrate to nitrite( bad spelling sorry). As for the water it should always be the same temp and chorene free. Find out from the water company if they use Ch or some thing else.Talk to a mom and pop fish shop.Pick up a copys of Fresh water and marien aquriem magazine or Tropical fish hobbist.|`|dEtKbDUaaa	2 gallons isnt very big to be honest but for a betta is ok... Ok well I use an algie scraper which is about ￡4 for a tiny one, I had a small tank and i rarely changed the water daily unless my fish was ill.. i have now got a 80L tank and I dont do a water change I wait for the water level to go down then top it up with dechlorinator and nitrate safe (reduces nitrate and amonia) you should take a water sample to the pet store to test the nitrate levels as if it is too high then your little betta can get the bends and die (isnt nice to see this happen) I would do a water change once a week but maybe take out 2 mug fulls, but having a filter keeps the water clean and nice, takes carbon out etc. I changed my water in my little tank when the water started to look a bit mirky or wen he was ill. Bettas look like they are ill cos in tanks they just mope about, you will need a live plant for him to rest on as bettas breathe in air so the need to get to the surface... I have 2 bettas in a 7gallon tank with loads of plants and 2 filters... but my friend who lives in thailand said bettas there are a native fish and live in rice pads, and puddles so they are pretty hardy when it comes down to it. I hope u enjoy your betta because i play with mine they are loving and very curious fish. if im watching tv they swim round till i notice them then they play hide and seek with me and follow my fingers.. <br>  bettas like to be at about 24 - 30 degrees faringheit.. i keep mine at 29 and they swim about happily|`|00RgkZF8aa	Remove the aquarium water with a gravel siphon; it looks like this: <a href="http://cichlidresearch.com/gifs/simpleaquarium/gravel_siphon_DSC_4803.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cichlidresearch.com/gifs/simpleaq...</a><br>  <br>  Here's how to use one if you don't know how to use it: <a href="http://www.fishlesscycling.com/articles/how_to_use_a_common_siphon.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishlesscycling.com/articles/...</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: Scrub the sides of the tank if you feel like you need to. <br>  <br>  And by the way, DO NOT take the Betta out of the tank when you're changing the water.<br>  <br>  EDIT 2: Adi87, 24-30 degrees Fahrenheit is below freezing point...I hope you mean 24-30 CELSIUS
AA11736483	It is recommended that you brush your cats teeth as todays commercial foods don't keep teeth clean. Brushing helps remove tarter. Tarter eventually builds up to plaque which can only be removed by a dental scaling. If not removed, infection can set in and result in serious health issues. There are rinses available that can kill germs if that is what is causing the bad breath. Bad breath is usually caused by bacteria. Your vet has oral hygeine supplies by C.E.T. that can maintain teeth.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	Oh my goodness how ridiculous!  <br>  <br>  First dry food will help to keep their teeth clean and could you imagine trying to brush a cat's teeth? <br>  <br>  I have had 4 cats in my lifetimes and never brushed their teeth and they all had great teeth and no bad breath (well one did once and she had to get some teeth pulled then it went away after they were pulled).<br>  <br>  A cat should not have bad breath, if they do they have have some sort of infection or bad teeth.|`|PfmXPbFpaa	You can get her used to brushing now to prevent tartar build up in the future.  And so that when you go to brush her teeth she is used to it and doesn't freak out.  You can also get her some treats or food that helps teeth, I believe hard crunchy food is recommended for scraping tartar off.<br>  <br>  The fish smell probably has a lot more to do with what you are feeding her than the health of her mouth.|`|FQyeGsIyaa	About 85% of adult cats have periodontal disease and it's the most common cause of health problems for cats.  28-67% of cats are also prone to a serious and very painful dental disease called 'tooth resorption which is the most common cause of tooth loss. Tooth resorption tends to occur in cats over 4 years of age and may be more common in purebred cats, especially Siamese and Abyssinians.<br>  <br>  My 2 1/2 yr old had some signs of gingivitis at her last checkup so the vet recommended I start brushing her teeth.  Hopefully, I'll be able to delay having to have her teeth cleaned by the vet (which is costly and requires anesthesia).  <br>  <br>  The link to Cornell College of Vet. Medicine has a good video on how to get your cat used to getting its teeth brushed.|`|wDmNpO8Gaa	Brush her teeth every night with cat toothpaste and a small brush to prevent cavities and bad breath. Clean teeth=fresh breath|`|K4bJgTF4aa	no
qlECsz0Iaa	a good rule of thumb is: take them out first thing in the morning and right before your about to go to bed at night.  alot of ppl also do it after each meal.<br>  <br>  i generally go by the dogs signs: sniffing around, squatting, some dogs will whine or bark to be let out, most dogs that are well potty trained will go to the door to be let outside.|`|HdOVYIWjaa	Take them out after they eat regardless if they show signs of needing to.  Puppies usually will go after they eat anyway.  Females will sniff around and will lower their behind (like they are going to sit) before they go to the bathroom.
pc1ua6wRaa	If you find an accident on the floor, lead your dog to it and yell loudly "no! not allowed!" this will let your dog know how you will react to accidents,(if you knew you would be punished or scolded for something, would you do it?) Try a bell. Buy a cheap cow bell. Start by letting the dog out every hour or so. Make sure you ring the bell before letting your dog out. after a few weeks, hang the bell on a string by the door. He will learn to paw at the bell when he needs to go potty. Soon, this will be convenient for both you and your dog.<br>  hope this helps!|`|UC9Wjjscaa	I take mine out alot.  Always take out first thing in morning, after playing, and after every meal.  When he does his bussiness say something like good potty or whatever phrase you want.  The main thing is to be consistent.|`|JsBb732Maa	<a href="http://www.midwesthomes4pets.com/Information/HowToCrateTrain.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.midwesthomes4pets.com/Informa...</a>   Crate training.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	One way you can help your dog to learn bladder and bowel control is to put her on a very rigid schedule.<br>  <br>  When you get up in the morning, take a treat (like a tiny bit of cheese) in your hand and take her on a leash for a walk around your backyard. Lead her to the place where you want her to do her business, and just wait while she sniffs around trying to find exactly the right spot.  As soon as she squats, say, calmly, "go potty" or "hurry up" or "get busy" or whatever phrase you want to use as a command word.  As soon as she's done, say "Good hurry up" or "good potty" or "good busy" or "good" whatever phrase you chose to use, and give her the treat.  Be sure to praise her effusively, but don't let her jump up on you while you're doing that.  Then stay out in the yard with her for a few minutes so that she doesn't get the idea that outside time stops as soon as she empties her bowels or bladder.  When you get back inside, you can remove both the leash and the collar.<br>  <br>  Then feed her.  Whatever she hasn't eaten after about 15 minutes should be picked up and put away - she can't learn to just dawdle over her meals.  After she's eaten, wait 15 - 30 minutes and then take her (and another treat) outside again.  Remember it's important that you go with her so that you can verify that she has indeed gone potty.  Again, just as she squats, give her the command word, and just as she finishes, give her the praise and the treat.  Again, stay out with her for a few minutes longer so she doesn't think outside time stops when she does what you've asked her to do.<br>  <br>  After breakfast, if you have to go to work, put her in her crate with a toy to play with, and close the door.  If you don't have a crate for her, put her in a room with a tiled floor and close the door.  If you put her in a room instead of in a crate, be sure to include a bowl of water. (I don't know about all crates, but ours came with a water bowl attached.  We got it from a friend, though, so I don't know if crates come with them or you have to buy it separately.  I don't see them in the pictures in the catalogs, though.)  Don't forget her toy.  And, if you like, put a wee-wee pad in the room.  It's scented so that she should be drawn to it when she has to go.<br>  <br>  If you don't have to go to work, she will play for an hour or so, then probably nap for awhile.  When she gets up, follow the same routine.  Take her (with a treat in hand) on leash to the area in which you want her to go, wait til she squats, give the command word, wait til she finishes, give her the praise and the treat, then hang around outside for another few minutes.<br>  <br>  Dogs should be taken outside 15-20 minutes after every meal, and as soon as possible after they wake up from sleep, whether at night or during the day in a nap.  Between times, don't expect her to hold her urine for more than 30 minutes for each month of her life until she's about 8 months old; at 3 months, that means no more than 1 1/2 hours, at 12 months, that means no more than 4 hours. If you find that she's going more often than that, decrease the time you wait between outings.<br>  <br>  Be sure to clean up any spots she has wet or soiled in the house with a good enzymatic cleaner.  There is one called Urine Gone that comes with a blue light so you can see the stains even when they aren't visible to the naked eye (I don't have any affiliation with the company that makes it).  Some folks say you can use vinegar and baking soda.  Put the vinegar on the spot, then sprinkle the baking soda on top.  Wait for it to dry and then vacuum it up.  I haven't tried this myself, so I don't know whether it will work or not.<br>  <br>  Never, ever scold her for making a mess in the house, especially if you don't catch her at it.  If you DO catch her, pick her up, tuck her tail between her legs, and take her outside to the designated area.  Since she won't be on leash this time, take her back inside when she's done.<br>  <br>  If you don't catch her at it, and you scold her, she is likely to think that it is the very act of pottying that you disapprove of.  Because she goes in so many different places in the house, she won't know that you object to the location instead of the act, and she's likely to start hiding or going into another room.<br>  <br>  Be sure her meals, playtimes, and exercise happen at the same time each day.  <br>  <br>  Don't expect this regimen to work overnight, but within a few weeks, she should have a pretty good grasp of it.  Then and only then - after she has stopped going in the house - you can teach her how to let you know when she has to go.  Some people have their dogs scratch at the back door, others have them ring bells hanging from the wall beside the door, and still others have their dogs just come and sit beside them and wait.  You'll have to choose the method that works best for you and for your dog.<br>  <br>  Hope this works for you!  good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|pc7ZjexJaa	DONT stick your dogs nose in it!<br>  <br>  crate training is great for any breed|`|SetgMzrAaa	when it goes pee in the house stick its nose in it!!|`|zt58dRE9aa	feed him on specific hours and only give him water twice a day and feed him twice a day. take him to walks a least twice a day.

But no, they will not contribute to or cause crystals in the urine.<br>  <br>  If you are feed a diet of primarily dry diet, then I suspect that is the culprit.  You can help your cat out by giving it a little cranberry juice (not the "fruit drink" type that has any added sugars or preservatives).<br>  <br>  I suggest you do some internet searches on uti/bladder issues.

PfmXPbFpaa	They should really be nursing until they are at least 6 weeks old.

The vet will be able to tell you how to take care of your little babies if their mama isn't doing such a great job.|`|eJ4IR5Epaa	Oh no, <br>  they cant have gard food or soft food, they probably wouldnt like it anyway, they should be nursing for about another month. <br>  Try to get the mother to nurse more. <br>  Put the babies near her milk as much as possible. If she stops altogether, if you can afford it, vets sell milk specifically for that type of situation, as it is prime development and growth time for the kittens.<br>  If you cannot afford it, you could try calling a vet for some advice, or just try bottlefeeding with warmed milk until they are about 8 weeks old. After about 8 weeks, thats the time to wein off of milk and onto water and kitten food, soft or hard. And litterbox training. Once they're 12 weeks they can leave your care.<br>  Good luck|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	Contact a vet.

They should be completely weaned from the KMR at 6-8 weeks.  Get some feeding syringes from your vet (cheap), like 10cc syringes and when you feed them, hold them in the crook of your arm (wear a bib, believe me), make sure their little heads are not faced up (so they don't aspirate any of the food), stick the syringe into the side of hte mouth and point towards throat, give little squirts at a time.  Once they're done, put them in their litter box - this trains them to use the litter box.  (Feed them as much as they'll eat every 3 hours.  They'll let you know exactly when they're done - lol, by just letting it drool out of their mouths, turning their heads, meowing loudly, jerking movements).<br>  <br>  When you are weaning, start mixing something like Max Kitten mixed with warm water and KMR mixture (less and less of KMR mixture every couple of days), enough so that it will flow through the syringe.<br>  <br>  Happy Kittening!  :-D<br>  <br>  <br>  p.s.  In response to someone below - as a long-time kitten foster, it's good to keep the kitty kibble out for them to get used to it.  They are definitely not too young to start taking little bites of it.  My fosters have always taken to the kitty kibble (along with the wet food) and have always done very well.<br>  <br>  p.p.s.s. - Do NOT feed the kitties regular milk - VERY bad for their digestive systems - same for grown cats, contrary to storybooks we've all read.|`|Amkmles0aa	thats the mom jobs|`|oDVx7nSxaa	Mom should still be feeding her kittens - there may be something wrong that she isn't producing enough milk for them.  She (and the kittens) should ideally go to the vet.  You'll need to supplement their feedings with kitten milk replacer from the pet store - they will need to be bottle fed until they're about 5 weeks old, when you can start feeding them with canned food watered down with the KMR.  They are way too young to be giving them solid foods, they won't do anything more than make a horrible mess of it.

K6fasl6kaa	he is probably confused because he is being run in and out too much.  his schedule is rather hectic for a baby.  he also must get a lot of praise for peeing if he urinates that much.  he probably is getting the message that its a cool trick.  dont overdo it on the pooping(jk).  i would suggest you get some good info on successful crate training and ease off on the pressure one you and the pup.  relax.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	yes<br>  bulldogs and pugs are hard to potty train|`|HdOVYIWjaa	When I was training my last puppy, she did tend to pee a lot in the house.  It seemed every time she would get excited she would tinkle a little.  My vet told me that she has an "excited" bladder, but to keep doing what I was doing and eventually she would learn to control her bladder.  I was able to fully train her by about 6 months.  You seem to be doing a very good job at keep your puppy on a schedule and rewarding him after he goes in the right spot.  His bladder muscles could be a little weaker than expected but as he grows he should be able to control them better and strengthen them.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	He's still a baby!  Many dogs can't hold their bladder more than 30 minutes for each month of their lives until they're 12 months old.  You're expecting too much of him too soon.  <br>  <br>  Keep up the schedule - that's exactly the right way to train him.  NEVER scold or punish him for wetting in the house unless you catch him in the act; when that happens, pick him up, tuck his tail between his legs, and carry him out to his potty place. And then never punish him.  He'll learn to hide from you when he goes, instead of asking you to take him out.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas
Um8osMNuaa	l used treats with my Lab, l just made her sit, then held the treat in front of her face, lowered it to the floor so she followed, and said down, she soon got the message that down meant for her to lay down.<br>  <br>  There's nothing a Lab won't do for a treat!|`|GSf09ALBaa	You want him to go down?  Easy.  Get him in his sit position, have a treat in your hand.  Put the treat in front of him where he will not be able to get up for it but will need to go down.  Once he gets there, hold it, let him sniff then reward.  Lots of praise.  Do it again.  <br>  <br>  You can also add some hands on by putting a leash on him.  Get him to sit then use the treat while you gently pull the lead down towards the ground using the word 'down' as you do it or you can use your foot to push the lead closer.   Use one word for each command.  <br>  <br>  After you get the vocal part accomplished start throwing in the hand signals.  Sit is a palms up raising your arm up and down is a a palms down in the downward move.  Or you can create your own hand signals that are privy to only your dog.  But make sure you are consistent and don't let anyone else use anything but what you have taught your dog.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|eY3KE1nCaa	i have a dog and you put a treat by his nose, and then slowly bring it down. then, say "down" so he knows what to do if u ask him again, and give him the treat after you make him lay down. also if you want him on his side, when he is down, drag the treat from his nose to the floor. or do something similar!|`|7g7goXTyaa	Easy. Take a food treat...let the dog know you have the treat. Cup in your hand on the ground and just wait....the dog will eventually lay down alongside your hand..once the dog lays down priase the dog and say good "laydown" give him/her the treat. <br>  <br>  Keep doing this about 20 times.....the dog will associate the words laydown with the her actions.|`|KZAbg67taa	Well, u ca do it in different ways, but I think this is the best way. <br>  <br>  You start by giving ur dog a treat. Then let ur dog run for a while, then give him a treat. Finally, say things for him to do and give him a treat. Then tell him to lay down and then give him a treat.|`|mvCbVREzaa	if you want to make him or her to lay down just  ttikle it|`|B8yKpGUnaa	Hold a treat in your fist, then move it down to the floor.

72cf671deef399824501fac66047b900aa	Get her on a routine.  DON'T PUNISH!  Feed at a certain time every day and then let out about 15 minutes after she eats.  Make sure the routine fits with your lifestyle.  When YOU CATCH HER peeing inside immediately take her outside.  Don't yell.  Once she pees outside tell her she's a good girl and give her a treat.  Have patience and you'll be fine!  She'll catch on.|`|eY3KE1nCaa	potty train her, just go to doggy school.  if u have water in the house, she is more likely to drink it and pee in the house. so if she really wants to drink water, as soon as she is finished, let her go outside to pee. my dog scratches at the door so we know she has to go :]|`|yh1XGdzGaa	any time you see her starting to pee inside the house take her outside immediately, when she finishes give her a treat.<br>  eventually she will get the idea|`|vDWHHuGkaa	Place your dog on a set schedule.  She should be able to hold her bladder for 4-5 hrs...there is a formula, take the age of the dog in months plus one and you get an estimate for how long they can hold their bladder.  Scheduled feedings and water at the same time ever day will help, then schedule potty times normally 15 mins after eating/drinking, after playing, sleeping, and before bed time.  Every time you dog potties outside praise her verbally with tons of enthusiasm.  Also, limit your dogs freedom to one space in the house until she gets the idea of pottying outside.  When you catch her in the act scoop her up and say no, then rush her outside to finish the job and give praise if she does.  You should only scold when you catch her in the act.  If she potties and you missed it the only thing you can do is clean it up with a good cleaner that takes out the scent that draws her to that location.  Once she gets the idea of when and where to go she should earn more freedom, another room.  Also, you can leash her to you.  <br>  After she fully understands to potty outside and she knows inside is wrong, I strongly suggest bell training. We have a bell hung on the back door that our pup now rings to alert us when he needs to go out...no more scheduled potty breaks needed once she understands what to do. To do the bell training I would say "outside" while ringing the bell and open the door, he would do his business and would be praised. Once he saw the connection with the bell ringing and the door opening...he began ringing on his own. Sometimes I would put treats in the bell at the beginning for more encouragement. But he was always taken outside for a potty break if that bell rang. Make sure you really praise when your pup potties outside...and only scold with a "no" and scoop rushing puppy outside when puppy is caught in the act of doing pottying inside. They have great training videos on www.petfinder.com<br>  <br>  Good luck :)

Remember: 1" of fish per 1(or 2, preferably) gallons of water for tropical fish, and 1" of fish per 1.5 gallons for goldfish. The Angelfish will likely get much bigger, but that shouldn't be much of a problem to your tank.

FewhKlx9aa	Males come home the same day of surgery,just make sure he has a collar so he does'nt lick and infect the stitches.Also make sure you get some pain pills to bring home as this is uncomfortable for them.The other thing is that as soon as they are neutered the hormones drop and the peeing all over can stop right away.My males calmed down immediatly for the better and they were 2 yrs.old.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	They don't generally keep males overnight unless the surgery is done late in the day. It's not nearly as major an operation as spaying a female. Neutering will change the behaviors you have mentioned if they are caused by hormones. Since he is a couple years old, the behaviors may have become ingrained and they may not change that drastically and it will take longer to see any changes.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	You can pick him up the same day or leave him over night. Recovery time is much shorter for males as the surgery is much less invasive. It could take as much as 2 months for his hormone levels to go down.

All the vets I've used tho do not keep dogs overnite for spay/neuter unless you want them to..  I ussually drop my pets off at the vet early in the morning, and they are ready to be picked up sometime in the afternoon.  The male is ussually still sleepy for about a day or so after bringing him home.. but they are ussually up and about with a few days as if nothing happened.<br>  <br>  <br>  In an older male, many of the behavoirs have become habits.  It will be harder to break this habits.  Once he's neutered tho, it will help reduce the hormonal urges, and it will be easier to train him.  It can take up to about 30 days or so after a neuter to reduce the hormones.|`|TJGje2blaa	Drop of early in morning; pick up later that same day.  Do not force to eat or drink until he comes around to doing it himself.  Don't let him jump up.  Give him a quiet place to lay & leave him alone.  He'll come around, after a day or two.  He'll mainly just sleep.   Also, no play or exercise.    3 years old isn't old, either.  Usually, it'll calm them down some but you won't notice much change, until they get a lot older.  They're all different, though.  If you notice him chewing at his stitches, you may need to get one of those special collars for him to wear while they're healing.   You can ask the vet about this.|`|gfuybX4Faa	I rescued an older dog and got him fixed a couple of months later (he had to be treated for heartworms first). I dropped him off at the vet  before work and picked him up after. By dinner time he was wanting to run around. He was a lot less aggressive after the surgery (letting my dachshund eat some of his food, sharing toys, etc.), and he started urinating like a girl dog (I'm not sure why he started doing that, because none of my other male dogs did that after getting fixed.). The aggression-thing was probably in the first month after the surgery. The urinating thing was almost immediately. He's so weird! :)
AX6DXGodaa	Hookworms typically only cause death when infection is very severe and only in puppies.  <br>  When dogs are dying they can experience DIC (disseminated intravascular coagulation) where the blood turns thick and they can experience spontaneous bleeding.  Many things cause DIC.  <br>  Severe bloody diarrhea can be caused by an anal tumor, severe bacterial overgrowth, or severe viral diseases (like parvo in puppies).  Certain toxins, immune mediated diseases, tick born diseases can cause low platelets leading to spontaneous bleeding.|`|7vJNHaskaa	I've heard this said about Parvo before...

VDP3pNCPaa	My suggestion is to first have her spayed, and have the vet check for any problems like fleas or worms.  The vet can do an antibody test for feline AIDS and feline leukemia.  The chances are high that the test will be negative.  If not, then you can find out the options and precautions.  I would not give your cat the leukemia vaccine, as it is not all that effective anyway.  (As I read your question, the new cat will be well over 16 weeks, which is the point where a false positive no longer is likely).<br>  <br>  You will have the normal introduction problems with bringing the new cat into your house.  If you bring her in, then take her to be spayed, she comes back with that dreaded 'vet' smell, causing potential problems all over again.  It would be like doing an introduction all over again, so have her spayed first and then do the introduction.  That way, she will be staying put for some time.|`|4a4b9be516eeab81005bf8f97c61e37aaa	Since the new cat has mated she needs to be tested for the leukemia virus and FIV too.  I would take her to the vet first, run those tests and have the spay done before bringing her home.  If she tests negative there is absolutely no reason to give either cats the leukemia vaccine (I too have heard that it can actually cause the disease).<br>  <br>  She can recover from her operation under your care.  She needs to be separated from your cat and the dog and the introductions made VERY slowly.|`|47zIiqdIaa	Get the cat tested first.Get the leukemia test.I lost two cats to it.One on it's one year birthday but she had It from day one I knew it from test but at the time the doctor said she might outgrow it.Just got two kittens two years ago first thing I did was take them to the Vet. before I took them in my house.The leukemia test was the first one I had him do. Then flea's. That is why you don't take in house first.Don't want fleas in the house. Hope this helps.|`|EaeEVGZyaa	Definitely have her tested when she's spayed. Do not bring her home until then.<br>  As you probably know, she'll need a space all her own where the other animals can't get to her, but can sniff under the door. Do not use your bedroom if at all possible, since your cat and dog probably would see that as an "invasion" of their space. When you do introduce her, be sure she is in her carrier and bring only one animal in to visit at a time.<br>  <br>  Is your neighbor (bless her heart) socializing the kittens? You should make time to visit and play with her. Since she was so hard to catch, she probably has people issues and will need lots of interaction and handling before she's ready to take on the challenges of a new home, another cat, and a dog!  Good luck to you.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	Take the young cat to the vet for a checkup and have them do the Elisa blood test for FeLV, that test gets an answer in 15 minutes and is very accurate for Feline Leukemia.  It's a double test, it also checks for FIV but the test has a known failure rate of about 20% for FIV, so it's only a 'maybe' if you get a yes on that part of the test.  A Western Blot would be used to confirm any FIV.  I really dislike the Elisa test for that reason, it has far too many false positives for FIV.<br>  <br>  Since she's 8 months old, if the mother had FIV all the kittens would test positive till about 9 months, after that their own immune system kicks in and most of the postiive kittens would now test negative and really not have FIV after all.  So do not freak out if a yes comes up on the FIV test, it's extremely doubtful that the cat would actually have it.  A retest is always in order on that at a later date when the kitten is older.<br>  <br>  So basically, if the FeLV leukemia test is negative, and the kitten does not have fleas or worms, then you can safely introduce them.

Samoyed's are not that large.. <br>  Great Pyrenees are very gentle giants, they were bred for protection of herds or flocks, from bears, mountain lions, wolves, and other predators... and Yes they can easily take down a bear in groups of two.. They do better in two's as they are a Herd Dog and enjoy the companionship of their mate or partner. They can be any where from 28" to 34" at the shoulder however I have had a few that were larger than the average breed size, Brutus stood at 6' tall on his hind legs and was 36" at the shoulder Bear is just a pup and stands already at 5'3" on his hind quarters.. They are very gentle but at the age of maturity can become a bit aggressive to prove dominance usually any where from 12months to 24 months of age..

ca94e42487ad3b3988db20bb798bce90aa	You wont believe it, cats do file their claws on their own by using scratch post.  Roped scratch post is a highly recommendation.  I moved the post in different spots and was going to vacuum the floor.  I found a lot of old claws laying around.  It is same idea people clips their nails and it fell on floor.  Pedipaws is good for dogs, to be honest.|`|rWSgC3WJaa	I just asked my vet about this 3 days ago. She said ABSOLUTELY NOT!  She has studied (with several other vets) the cat that is in the ad. They all believed that the cat was under the effect of a tranquilizer or something. The motor noise alone is enough to scare many cats.<br>  The best idea is to trim 1/8 inch off of your cat's nails each week then have a sisal scratching post so that the cat can wear off the "sides" which will look to you like little white crescents. Cats nails are different from other animals in that they grow in length and width. <br>  <br>  What happens if you don't trip their nails and perhaps they are aging and don't have interest in a scratching post. The nail will grow in a complete circle right into the pads of their "toes."  This happened to my Mother's cat - WHAT A MESS. This cat was terrified of having her nails trimmed so I let it go ONLY 2 MONTHS and we noticed her walking rather "gingerly" - so Mom picked her up, I put on the leather gloves, took one look at her left dew claw and almost passed out. It was a huge circular nail. We didn't know where it started or where it ended. So VERY carefully I began gently trimming away at the "circle" until a huge "ball" of nail material fell into my hand. And we had 9 more to go. 7 grew into the pad so there was bleeding, etc. It's so important to get your cat used to having their nails trimmed and as awful as it is for you, you must give your pet appropriate grooming. That includes nail trimming.<br>  <br>  WHATEVER YOU DO, PLEASE DO NOT HAVE YOUR CAT DE-CLAWED!!!  That's all I'm going to say - but it's not the procedure you think it is.<br>  <br>  Save youR money, calmly trim her nails - (many vets will be happy to do it for you every month for free!) and enjoy your bundle of unconditional love.<br>  Barb|`|7zYJbOqKaa	PEDIPAWS IS GREAT!! I use it on my dog all the time. I'll occasionally use it on my cat as well. Its better if used on dogs though. Cats are able to clean themselves and able to cut back there toenails themselves.|`|fD1OLPk3aa	ya i just got 1 and it works great it might take a couple of days for ur cat to get used to it but ya it works just fine|`|EpNR16fVaa	I have one, I wasn't too satisfied with it. It takes longer than just clipping them and it's kinda loud, so it may freak the cat out.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I would not waste the money/time to try it.  I clip my cats' nails about once a week anyway and I know neither one of them would sit still enough to use the Pedipaws on them.|`|KsLm8qg3aa	My sister has one for her two dogs.  They work great, their nails look good and she said it's a lot less trouble than trying to clip them.  I'm not sure if she uses them on the cat.  Generally, given a post to scratch on, the cat will file down the nails themselves.
Amkmles0aa	my cats do|`|0mb78CiWaa	Cats do have eyelashes. They are just short. If you look closely at your cats eyes you will see them.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	They do.  You're not looking close enough. The lashes are thicker and longer than the fur just above them on the edge of the eyelid.  Dogs have them too.|`|lTsDwY9Paa	All 6 of my cats have eye lashes, they're just very light and hard to see.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Mine do... they are much shorter and finer than a human's eyelashes, though.|`|teFKJflZaa	if you look closely they do. and they are very cute and small :)|`|yxJKgf9Faa	hii if you look closely then you will see that cats do have eyelashes they are just less visible as they are the same colour as the fur!<br>  <br>  hope this helps x

Poor dog. Im glad your finding her a new home.
x1KRxDuGaa	This happened to our dog. As she got older, she became more picky. I don't know why. It just did. We took her to the vet and everything.|`|w5AtjQqaaa	It's probably going through the menopause.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	She's picky.  Just like us, dogs have preferences for certain things.<br>  <br>  To get her unpicky, feed her only dry kibble.  Put her food down for 15 mins and if she doesn't eat it, pick it up.  And at the next meal time put it down for 15 mins and if she doens't eat, pick it up.  And no treats until she eats her kibble.<br>  <br>  She might boycott a couple of meals but no dog is going to allow itself to starve when there is food available.  Once she starts eating the kibble, she'll get used to it and keep eating it.|`|iRL3eULWaa	sum dogs as they get older loose their appetite, or get bored and want more attention, my sis is a vet, she told me all this!..<br>  maybe buy different types of food and put it in her or his bowl and see which 1 it takes to... it works trust me!|`|xarKlp0Oaa	If she is hungry she will eat if there is nothing wrong.|`|EWXzNyk8aa	Some dogs just become more picky as they grow and mature.|`|U3abIK7Zaa	If your dogs eats alot of variety of food it gets picky. expecially if it is table food because the dog knows it can eat better then what its getting. My dog does that too. He used to eat anything but then we started feeding him human food.  He know wil leat is dog food but if we feed him human food he expects as good as it comes.|`|QSmzxiSoaa	The dog is eating what it wants to eat since you have let her eat any thing but what she is suppose to eat. I know this sounds mean but just give it a try. Put its food down let it know it has the food. If she dose not eat it then fine just pick it up and put it away tell next feeding time put it down and let her know that she has food down. Again if she dose not eat it pick it up. When she gets hungry enough then she will eat. She has been though to be picky that is what your problem is.|`|c6LKHp54aa	Check her gums or toung and is she fixed becasue she might be preg tell me if any other  changes occure
MmRDzhaHaa	Depends what has she eaten,cat food is like chewed up poo! but keep an eye on her and only give her small amounts and often, rather than a big meal twice,as her stomach is a bit smaller with being squashed by her pregnant tummy! if she starts to show other symptoms take her to the vet for a check up.|`|BXgfLFVyaa	Hmm call the vet.|`|6SN2LnmYaa	My cat used to get real sick when she was pregnant as well. We called the vet and asked about it and he said that she is fine that she was having morning sickness just like a woman would if she was pregnant. I would call your vet and double check just in case. Just to make sure everything is ok! Hope this helps and congrats on the new kittens coming!!
Amkmles0aa	yes|`|oDVx7nSxaa	A vomiting pregnant cat needs to go to the vet.  It's not a sign that she's about to give birth, it's a sign that she is sick.|`|g62ATenqaa	This is not normal at all. Most usual signs of imminent labour are restlessness and making the 'bed' ready for giving birth. In the case of one of my cats who gave birth to 5 kittens 2 weeks ago, she became more affectionate (towards me anyway), and couldnt stop purring.|`|N8cAwzxzaa	Cat vomit often looks like poo. You should call your vet. It doesn't cost anything to ring up and ask.|`|DufCLIMsaa	Yes it is normal.  My cat did.  I am not sure why though.
B6zl0AJDaa	It's not the height of your horse you pick a saddle for, it's the body type.<br>  <br>  If you're riding Western, then it's the tree size, which is Full Quarter Horse, Semi Quarter Horse and Arabian sizes.<br>  <br>  A Quarter Horse which is WIDE through the withers wears a Full QH tree, a Thoroughbred or Running QH would wear a semi QH tree and an Arab or Morgan would wear an Arabian tree.<br>  <br>  For your seat size, measure from your hip to your knee then subtract 2 inches from that and you have your seat size.<br>  <br>  For English, the tree sizes are, narrow, medium, medium wide and extra wide.  <br>  <br>  A Thoroughbred or running QH would wear a medium or medium wide tree a QH, Arab or Morgan a WIDE treed saddle.<br>  <br>  For your seat size, measure from your hip to your knee.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	my pony uses the same saddles as my regular horses.  It would be the same.  Its not height that you take into consideration, its width of horse.  narrow, wide, extra wide, ect... Not height.  A second hand saddle.  it depends on brand, style of riding, ect,..|`|aOjMf5SPaa	Huh? What? A saddle doesnt really rely on the height of your horse. All horses are built differently, and you need to take into consideration the size of the gullet, the size of your bum, and the type of saddle you need. Are you buying for the first time? if so, get professional advice.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	That's rather like asking how much a second hand car will cost for a 5 foot tall teenager lol<br>  <br>  The answer is-it depends on how much you are willing to spend.<br>  <br>  First of all, you don't fit the saddle based on the height of the horse. First, you fit the seat and flaps to YOU, second you fit the width of the gullet to your horse. <br>  <br>  What you really need is to have someone knowledgeable to measure your horse, so you know what size tree he needs. Then you need to figure out what size seat and flap YOU need.  Then you have to decide what style of saddle you want(what do you plan to do with it?).<br>  <br>  After that, THEN start looking for second hand saddles.  Stay away from the really cheap brands. They usually have wooden trees which crack easily(and a broken tree will hurt you AND your horse), and the balance isn't correct, making correct riding difficult.  Buy the best saddle you can afford.  <br>  <br>  Most name brand saddles can be found for anywhere from 200 on up to as much as you want to pay. You may have to really shop around, and you may end up with an older saddle that isn't quite the "in" thing. But if it's good quality and in good repair, that won't be a problem.|`|vfhKkiSKaa	What kind of saddle?  Western, dressage, all purpose, close contact, plantation, racing, aussie...  There are many kinds of saddles depending on what type of riding you will be doing.  It also depends on the quality you want.  Are you looking for something just to beat around in, or do you want something nicer that will last longer or maybe something you may show in?<br>  <br>  Prices for saddles can range from getting a crappy cheapie one for like $100 to getting a Hermes for $4,000.<br>  <br>  Also, the price of the saddle has nothing to do with the size of the horse.  It all has to do with the quality of workmanship and the quality of materials used in making the saddle.|`|96InprHCaa	I once saw a saddle for 25 dollars that was used, but i dont think you would get that lucky, maybe 50 to 100 dollars if it was really used, kinda used might be more|`|kwhfazx7aa	Hi,<br>  Size of horse, width and length of saddle don't really determine price.<br>  The price depends on the type of saddle ie: what discipline, American English etc.  Then whether the saddle is synthetic or leather, make of the saddle and quality.<br>  You can pick up a good quality and condition synthetic for approx ￡100-￡150.  You may be lucky and find one cheaper.<br>  A good quality English leather saddle can range vastly but I have picked up 3  ￡170 Antil Genuine (don't know spelling), ￡250 Antil and ￡300 Ideal.<br>  Always have any saddle checked and fited by a saddler or other qualified person.<br>  Good saddles are out there so good luck.|`|Y5WJWnvbaa	saddles are guaged by width, in inches, as opposed to the height of your horse.<br>  <br>  they are also discipline-specific, for example: dressage, jumping, showing; general purpose and racing.<br>  <br>  these can greatly affect the amount you can expect to pay for a saddle.<br>  <br>  also, there are a great deal of saddlers out there. well-known and trusted saddlers [barnsby, for one!] will cost you a lot more than an un-named/branded saddle.<br>  <br>  the best thing you can do is arrange to see your local saddler/tack shop, and have your horse measured, so you can figure out what width you require, then ask them if they have any second hand, or perhaps new, saddles which will suit the purpose you require it for.|`|Nh3ZDjwhaa	I bought a gently used HDR close contact Oak Bark 16' saddle for my 14.1hh appaloosa pony and I paid 650$. It was originally 850$. The previous owner only used it TWO TIMES b/c she trained other peoples horses for them and used their saddles so she didnt need one of their own. Saddles are always still going to be expensive.|`|BGyxjekKaa	If you know the measurements he needs i.e 7 inches D ring to D ring, 17 inches then you can get one off ebay but its a risk.  You could probablly get a good second hand one for 100 quid, an older one for 50.  (I got one for 50 and it luckily fits my horse perfectly)|`|1UKWQytVaa	well, depending on how rough it is used.  gently used, i got an ap (all purpose) english saddle for $200.00 ish... so just tell me what state you live in i have a few search results for possibly your state.. plz mail me bak with your state too..|`|CBVHd3eHaa	it really will depend on the brand of saddle, type(jumping, all around, barrel, pleasure) and how the good the condition of it is..<br>  <br>  please leave more info next time|`|eji2mBAlaa	It really depends.  <br>  <br>  Do you want real leather or synthetic?<br>  Dressage saddle?<br>  Jumping saddle?<br>  Racing saddle?<br>  GP saddle?<br>  English or Western?<br>  <br>  These are all things you need to consider first.

V5DON3XGaa	OMG! ONLY IF YOU WANT THAT DOG TO EAT YOUR HEART OUT WHILE YOU SLEEP! THEIR EVIL!!!|`|RN1wGlWWaa	IMO I side with you - dogs should have their own bed/crate to sleep in - not in your bed.  You as "pack leaders" should have top priority of sleeping places.<br>  <br>  You could have issues of her refusing to get off the bed when commanded when she gets older.  Better not to start a habit then to try and correct one later!|`|oGVWdnHraa	Trust me, you need to convince your husband now because it is not fun sleeping with a full grown pit bull when there are two people in the bed! Especially over winter!!! They are bed hogs!! lol :D|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	No, its not wrong. <br>  <br>  Put your foot down, she's going to get bigger, and more energetic, and eventually she's going to start coming indoors with muddy feet and a shedding coat-- and the first place she'll head is your bed!<br>  <br>  If it comes down to it, spray deterrent on the bed that makes it smell unpleasant for her to be there or around it (its undetectable by the human nose.)<br>  <br>  PS> If thats her in your icon, you've got quite the beauty!|`|pc7ZjexJaa	I would ask him to please respect your wishes<br>  <br>  <br>  I let my dogs on my bed. but its a choice that I make<br>  many people think its gross<br>  but theyre clean and those people dont have to sleep in my bed if they think its gross<br>  <br>  ADD: actually. the 'pit bull' breeds rate very high in temperament testing.<br>  better than many of the breeds that are thought to be great family dogs|`|7fb9ba045d96cd607bd916c4c659256caa	<a href="http://leerburg.com/pitbull.htm" rel="nofollow">http://leerburg.com/pitbull.htm</a>|`|YV1bOajXaa	This is more a relationship question than a pet question, but as far as not wanting the dog on the bed - that is a personal preference.  I don't allow our dogs to sleep with us, but if I'm sitting on the bed using my laptop or watching TV, our one dog likes to be on the bed and I don't mind as long as she's on the outside - not under the blankets!   She only comes up when I signal her to come up and doesn't cry if I don't signal her.  Being that your dog is a puppy, there is a safety issue too.  If the puppy gets too close to the edge of the bed, she could fall off and injure herself.  Maybe you could try that tactic - it's for the safety of the puppy.|`|KYMDPdA8aa	No, if you have to always tell your husband how you fell about things. If you dont it will just cause bigger issues later on in the realationship. As the dog gets older he will have trouble understanding that he is not allowed in bed anymore. Its better to do it now. It will be easier on everybody including the dog.|`|OblSdMaaaa	No!<br>  <br>  If the dog isn't going to be allowed to sleep on the bed then don't teach it how to at such a young age.  Old habits are hard to break in animals.  Next thing you know she will be all over your furniture, and/or your kids/guests beds if you have any.<br>  <br>  You share the bed, your input on this issue counts just as much as his.|`|Xyj4nmFnaa	As your ***** gets older she will become possessive towards your husband and she is going to be a big dog pushing her off will not be an option when she is fully grown. You need to put your foot down with your husband this is the marital bed not a dog bed!!|`|6SeWCfUfaa	No, it's not wrong.  And this is not a dog problem.  This is a relationship with your husband problem.  The two of you are having communication problems.  Get counseling.|`|dVzPKGGiaa	its not wrong to tell him but you do need to communicate. thats the worst thing not to communicate|`|XlOrWxxGaa	ya cant tell him<br>  they dont listen<br>  and they always right... at least they are in THIER minds!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  u poor wee soul... i feel for you|`|cpxkROqMaa	My wife and I have had three dogs in 27 years. Are oldest dog that has passed away was a small dachshund, miniature pinture mix. He was small and as he got older we put him on our bed for his comfort. As our daughter got her dogs, that have become ours. They got use to being on her bed, and now no mater what we still find them up on our beds. The guest room had become the dogs room. It's best to start training your dog as a puppy to not get on the bed.<br>  <br>  Good luck, once they start on the bed it's a hard habbit to break.|`|yp0GQz5Laa	I'm not joking: Tell your husband that the bed is a sacred sex location, and you don't want anything on it but your naked bodies.  He'll like that you value your sexual relationship, and that will cause him to empathize with your feelings. Basically, boost his ego by telling him how much you value your sexual relationship and the bed where that occurs and he'll be like putty in your hands.|`|StWYMSv0aa	NOT AT ALL!<br>  <br>  we let my pup harvey jump on the couch so much and now its a habit for him. <br>            there is nothing wrong with telling him. if he is an understanding husband he will understand. i also heard that its ok if you let your pet sleep in your bed for once a week. its also unhealthy because all the human DNA on the bed might not react well with with her. <br>            plus you don't want fur in your bed|`|6xqdKxwIaa	NO you are not wrong. Because when shes full grown shes going to think its okay to sleep on the bed and its going to be hard to get her off the bed once shes used to it. Im in the same situation with my puppy my boyfriend brings him on the bed and hes lab mix. so i know hes going to be a big dog.|`|g36NU81raa	Yes, tell him. Once she gets on the bed, she may try to dominate it and that will lead to aggression. It's better to stop it before.|`|QDQwKbM6aa	No not at all!<br>  It's for your own sake. You don't have to have it on your bed but when it gets olderyou won't be able to snuggle it on your bed!

I also think its is wiser to feed dog food from a kibble than to make it yourself b/c too many owners don't give their dogs the right amount of nutrients their dogs need. To do that its best to speak with a board certified nutritionist (your vet should have a number for one)...but many people who feed raw or home based diets will disagree. <br>  <br>  These are just my thought and I'm sure many will disagree.

Did she ever have distemper or been exposed to distemper?|`|yp0GQz5Laa	Maybe she's just playing... chasing her tail, or likes the feeling of spinning around.  I doubt that there is anything to worry about. When I was a kid, I liked to throw myself on a couch just for the thrill.  I doubt it's much different.  Also, when dogs are in their home, they have an instinctive need to trample the floor to make it flat and comfortable.  Although this makes no sense in a house, she might do it instinctively.
4vrUbRujaa	it's gonna take a lot of time to teach a dog not to pull the leash....<br>  when i train my dog, i keep him on my left side (or right if u want) but only one side only. Don't tighten the leash when walking, but pull the dog back when he started to pull the leash, tell him NO and sit. then u start to walk (u first) and tell him to fallow, if he fallow without pulling the leash, give him foods.<br>  <br>  *don't change direction, and when stop, u have to pull the dog back, so the dog know something is not right ( i can guarantee that they know where the problem is. It's just the matter if the dog want to listen to u ).|`|0QTCiCf8aa	First. when you are walking your dog do not move until your dog is not pulling, also using a  clicker will help. Click with the leash is loose and reward. <br>  <br>  If this does not work, a prong collar will help, THESE ARE NOT CRUEL unless you use them in a cruel way, i use it on my beagle basset hound and she was  a new dog when i put it on her, she was an awful puller before the collar. My pit bull does not require one.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Get a choker collar.  Don't pull steadly, give and release.  When he stops pulling let him go a little.  It's a lot more effective to jerk on the leash sharply once or twice than to pull back steadily for a long time.  The jerk surprises him but the pull he can get used to. <br>  <br>  A good harness to try is the "gentle leader".  I raise seeing eye dogs and this is the collar we use on a headstrong dog.|`|GSf09ALBaa	Nah, shaking rocks in a bottle don't work.  You have a Pit?  Just curious.  They are extreme pullers.  Probably one of the worst because of the strength in their hindquarters and the muscling around the neck pretty much makes a prong collar useless.<br>  <br>  Okay, stopping the pulling on the leash has to start with obedience training.  If you haven't already, your dog needs to know the basic sit, stay and down.  Also, that you are the pack leader.  He does not go out the door or rush the door.  He has boundaries and limitations inside the house and anywhere else you deem necessary.  <br>  <br>  Once you have established where you are in the ranking (at the top) then you can address the leash pulling fiasco.  It really does not make a difference what kind of collar you use except do not use a collar that releases and do not use a harness.  A harness gives them more pulling power.  I prefer the Martingale because I can get it up around her neck right at her ears.  That is where you have the control.  This is very important.  If you can keep that collar right at the base of the ears, you have control. Use a short lead.  4 ft.  Before you leave the house, a sit stay is mandatory.  Never let the dog take you out the door.  You do that, you lost control.  You can use the treat lure if you want.  Take some treats with you and as you are walking have the treat right at his head and his head should be right next to your knee.<br>  As he is 'heeling' you can reward with a treat.  Now, don't use this continuously because they get bored.  Keep that collar up around ears, the lead up and keep it tight.  By tight I mean don't give him a lot of lead to take off with.  Every block or so, do a stop and sit.  This re-establishes your power.  Then, on your command, you can use the word come, heel, walk whatever, you make the first move.<br>  <br>  At any time during this the dog begins to pull you can give a tug with the leash to the side and keep it taunt until the dog slows down.  Once the dog is heeling, loosen up the lead.  Praise and a few more treats.<br>  <br>  This takes time.  I still have problems with my 7 month old Pit.  Some days she is great and others she wears me out.  <br>  <br>  It all comes down to this:  Collar right behind ears.  Short lead.  Obedience.  Treats.  Pack Leadership.  Stay calm.  You get frustrated stop.  You transfer it to the dog.  Patience, sir.|`|eEeCIRDaaa	Try a gentle leader.  It is a head harness so when he tries to pull he cant because you have control of his head, just like a horse.  <br>  Also if you don't want to try that you can try pulling up on the leash when he pulls instead of back so that the collar is controlling his throat instead of his chest.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	I use a prong collar<br>  <br>  <br>  maybe try enrolling in obedience as well.<br>  <br>  there are many different ways. what works for 1 person may not work for another<br>  <br>  <br>  one thing-if you keep walking. it rewards that behavior. so when your dog pulls. stop. and don't move.<br>  also... give them treats every few steps while theyre next to you<br>  hold the leash and clicker (clicker training works great) in your left hand. and treats in the other. click and treat every few steps that theyre next to you.|`|AA11878029	some dogs are just dumb....choker collar maybe idk my girlfriend has the same problem and its been two years she just quit walking the dog !!

It is not your dog, it is your methods and your energy, specific advice would require being there to see specifically how much you are doing wrong.  If you learn how to do obedience, your dog will just follow right along.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	have you tried obedience classes and a special head halter called a gentle leader?|`|OI8R5KK0aa	There are some leashes that are supposed to help but they are very uncomfortable for the dog.

You have to let them know that unless they walk next to you, they're not going to get to it.  When your dog starts pulling on a walk, instead of just changing direction, walk in circles a couple of times.  Your dog reminds me a little of my dog, and I have tried this.  It didn't cure the problem completely, but it helped.  Also try doing that before you start the walk, up and down the sidewalk in front of your house. Also, have you tried the gentle lead harness?  It has a strap that goes around the nose.  This did not work on my dog, but it might work on yours.  Hope I can help.|`|oFMCWge3aa	hi x this dog sounds tough but you can always train him easy! the most important thing from personal experience is walk your dog, do not let your dog walk you! <br>  The collar should be far up on the neck, giving you more control over the dog. I wouldnt recommended a body harness for walking dogs. The harness goes around the strongest point on the dogs body making it difficult to control the dog. Keeping the lead high up on the neck the same way they do in dog shows gives you more control with less effort. There should be no tension in the lead. Do not allow the dog to pull and don't constantly pull on your dog. Relax! <br>  <br>  If you find the dog pulling, stop and make the dog sit. Correct any excited behavior over the distraction with a tug, and if that does not work you can also use a firm touch to the neck using your hand as a claw. (This method is used by proffesional dog trainers and trust me it is very helpful in the long term)! Do this as soon as you see the dog starting to avert his gaze toward a distraction, or as soon as you see a look in your dog's eyes that tells you he is going to begin barking or growling. Timing is everything! <br>  <br>  This must be done right before the bad behavior happens or at the exact moment it starts. You do not want to wait until it escalates. If you wait too long before correcting a dog (we are talking seconds), the dog may not even hear you; he will be too focused on the distraction. When correcting your dog, match your dogs intensity! <br>  <br>  I hope you train your dog well! <br>  Good luck!! I hope i helped! x x x|`|nTg8hP21aa	Have you tried using a correction collar like a prong. Simply give her a correction when she pulls and she will stop. Dogs avoid unpleasant experiences so if you make it unpleasant she'll stop pulling. Remember to stay consistent once she stops or she will go back to pulling. <br>  <br>  It sounds to me like your dog needs obedience training. Teaching her to heal will help.<br>  <br>  I've listed two sites in the resources section that can help with this pulling problem and with possible other issues you're having|`|d2fgKvAnaa	My dog uses a head collar that pulls his head around and it works pretty well for him, but every dog is different. You have to make sure you put it on correctly and desensitize them to it by using a treat in your hand to put their head into it every time. Then they will associate it with something positive. Does your dog get out very often? Sometimes they just are so excited to get out, that nothing will work until you socialize them more. Be consistent if you are trying the changing directions technique, because that one teaches them they do not get to decide where they go, you do. Hope this helps!|`|TWsxP46Qaa	harnesses are no good the only help the dog transfer power,ie more strength to the pull  thats why harnesses are used on huskies<br>  <br>  choke chains and pinch chains are no good either they only throttle the dog leaving it confused,it thinks your punishing it<br>  <br>  in the uk there is a product call a "halti" harness,its like a horses bridle but in dog size,it attaches to the lead from under the dogs lower jaw,one pull and it forces the mouth shut,not forcefull enough to injure the tongue though,usually one outing with the halti stops even the worst offenders,we've used them on german shepards dobermans,rotties and bull mastives as well as smaller breeds,|`|ZiC2hGm4aa	I used to hate taking our Staffie for a walk..my arms used to ache so bad afterwards..

Amkmles0aa	yes|`|RN1wGlWWaa	No - you can register your cat as a household pet and show it in ACFA, TICA, and CFA (I think).  I know that ACFA/TICA will register purebreds with out pedigrees only in the household pet classes.<br>  <br>  A long time ago (early 70's) CFA used to allow limited registration of "unknown" cats - mixes to be registered as American Shorthairs to build up the gene pool.  They closed that after a certain amount of time.|`|oDVx7nSxaa	No legitimate ones - the only real associations are CFA and TICA.  These all require that the cat have registered parents.

Czh1fbQgaa	The best thing you can do is shadow an equine vet for a day. I was lucky enough to have one just down the road from me. I never did get the chance though. There was a great career website, but I can't remember what it was. Google the schooling requirements. I know in highschool, take as many math and science classes. If your highschool offers animal science/boilogy, take it. Be warned though, 8 years of college and 2 years as an intern is a long time of schooling.|`|EghHVkHEaa	Im also an aspiring vet, i haven't decided if i wanted to specialize in horses yet though.

Your grades have to be HIGH. This is a good, well paid and particular job. You have to be skilled and willing.

While there, get him a full blood panel to see what's really going on.<br>  <br>  As an aside, if you ever switch foods with a cat, do it slowly over about a 2 week period, mixing it with the old food or you'll also have a lot of diarrhea on your hands (well, not ON your hands, but you know what I mean).<br>  <br>  Consistent throwing up is very serious - take him to the emergency vet if he's dehydrated tonight - now!  If not, get him into the vet tomorrow - not the day after tomorrow, but tomorrow for a full blood panel.|`|wDmNpO8Gaa	Your cat may have hairballs, so the best remedy for that is to feed him pure butter or petroleum jelly )vaseline).  Put a bit of butter or vaseline on his paw and let him lick it off.  The fat on the products will help move the hairballs down and he won't throw up as much.  Brush his hair weekly so he won't eat as much furs when he grooms himself.|`|RCmm3rSPaa	I'd definitely take him to a vet. He might just need his food changing, but if there's something wrong with him he might get very weak if not much of the food is staying down.|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	Does he get hairballs? Does he have a habit of eating things that he shouldn't like string or other bits from around the house? He may have an intestinal obstruction? I am a vet nurse and see these all the time so best take him to a vet.|`|8uNXjNknaa	You need to switch the food and get fresh water. He doesn't like the food, but he is so hungry he needs to eat.|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	Call a vet.  It's not normal for him to throw up food after he eats and drinks.  If it was just eating I'd think to change the food.  But it's both.
Amkmles0aa	yes|`|hhhk499qaa	It's a good name esp. if it's a persian cat.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	yeah persia sounds awesome, actually you just reminded me of a computer game i used to love when i was a kid, prince of persia..... i don't like trent though..... maybe adam, mick, roger... anything but trent|`|pNeakgzlaa	I think it's okay, I mean, people name their cats cookie and brownie, why not persia?|`|FvMtam2Aaa	I love that!<br>  <br>  My cat's name is Diva and she is a Diva ha ha|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	If you like the name, then go for it :)|`|jB5vxOtWaa	Nala or Raja are good cat names.|`|uqSbj8WQaa	Persia is very pretty.

GrYhFNMdaa	Sometimes they bond more with one person. My rabbit is female but has bonded strongly with me and not as much with my boyfriend. I spend alot of time with her as he doesn't so maybe you could be with her more. My rabbit does circle both me and my boyfriend and my vet said its a sexual maturity thing. She could have chosen your boyfriend as a suitable mate (sounds weird but its true)|`|c7KCto2Raa	how do you know that your cat likes him? You are not the cat, stop having feelings for the cat if you want to actually grow up and learn something look up the word anthropomorphic.|`|3oswni4Vaa	my cat does this to my boyfriend as well (follows him but not licks his pants)<br>  i think its just because he is someone different/new to play with :-)|`|ZH4N6Xdtaa	One of my rabbits does this too, I think she has just bonded with him and not me!<br>  <br>  Just play with the bunny and soon she will love you too!
Xobbmd7Saa	I would wait a few years before you show them. A horse and rider that are both new to showing is not a good match. You can't even ride them for a few years and you need to be able to ride them first unless you just want to show in hand. In the mean time, see if you can find a show stable and take some schoolies into shows to gain some experience showing. Teaching a horse to show will be way easier if you are not learning yourself. Start your horse off in some green classes when they get older and work your way up.|`|gqpZU2lJaa	Halter... You Walk them to the judge and then Trot away from them.. & SMILE|`|GksOStrsaa	Are you english or western? If you're english, you can show them in greenie classes.(baby green) I'd start with a really small schooling show to get them used to the atmosphere. If you really don't know anything about showing i wouldn't start with yearlings. Its possible that they will become very spooky at shows. If you have enough money, get an experienced trainer to show them first, or at least school them. Of course, depending on the breed, you may have to wait a few years to show.|`|Z4CKfwjQaa	Well right now the only kind of showing you can do at that age is   Halter classes. well they must be in tip top shape first and than all you do is go in to the ring and stand him up for the Judge and make sure you are al ways standing were the judge can see you and you can see him at all times. for now that is all i feel you can do with the little guys and they are so cute!!!! good Luck!!
G0KKfXMUaa	Wow... you remind me of me when I was younger! Haha. With time, you can over come that, no worries =)<br>  <br>  Well first, let me tell you something that took be a while to learn... A horse will never attack you (unless something is wrong in his mind). Do NOT do this, but  I guarantee you that while she's tossing her head, if you rapidly jerked your hands up, she'd be scared and run away. She wouldn't try to hurt you. So don't be too afraid. The worse she'll do, if she's completely sane and doesn't have a history of being aggresive, is maybe nip. And if she toes, just push her head away, or rapidly jerk the area away that she is trying to nip at.<br>  <br>  Anyways, you need to get your confidence back up. Do you have another horse? If not, try to just get some lessons on a calm, push botton horse. This way you can learn to control a horse better, have confidence, and truly realize that you have nothing to be afraid of.<br>  <br>  Once you get more confidence, try the haltering again. Instead of being timid, allowing your fingers to fumble with the bridle, and having a shaky voice... Go in there with a firm voice, a firm touch, and a set goal. Go in there as if you're a professional and have been riding for years. Don't ask her if you can put on the halter. Just put it on. Have the halter ready before hand, so that you don't have to mess with it, and just go in there and do it. She'll be ok once she sense's your new confidence.<br>  <br>  If this all goes well, crosstie her up and groom her. Again, don't be nervous or let her feel your shaky hands. Have a firm, yet calm voice as well.<br>  <br>  After a few days, she'll get a hang of the new you. Once you establish respect and the bond between horse and rider (going both ways), you can begin to ride much better. When you ride, don't fumble with the reins and shake your leg. Be a calm, firm, and strong rider. Just go in there with a mindset that you can do it, and will do it.<br>  <br>  You seem like a really nice guy, good luck to you and your dad =)|`|GksOStrsaa	Horses are for the most part nice. I doubt she would intentionally hurt you. Treats always help. Horses can tell when you're nervous, so try to swallow your fear when you're with her. It would help if  you could maybe take lessons at a local barn where there will be plenty of people to help you.|`|Yz2OHyblaa	im sorry but from reading it i think you got a horse that isnt good for you.you need a calmer horse.possibly an older one.i also thin that your not ready to own a horse yet.it takes a lot of experience and you need to know what your doing before u get hurt.im not trying to be mean.just looking out for your safety|`|Ky3rQ3fYaa	Horses do not intentionally try to hurt people under most situations.  If you are afraid of the horse, she can feed off that.  Horses have great sense about things.  It will take a lot of time and a lot of patience; you will ahve to build a rapport and a trust.  Start by talking to her, bringing her an apple, brushing her.  Little baby steps.  Remeber Rome wasn't built in a day. <br>  <br>  If you talk to 100 diff people, you will get 100 diff answers.  I had some suggest the Parelli system and I am getting ready to try that with my meat head.  A lot of times it is the rider ( I know in my case it is) and not the horse.  Usually we are the ones that need the training, not them.  Horses are naturally claustrophic and wired to beat feet.  If they feel unsafe about the situation, they go into flight mode.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as showing a 1200+ pound animal "who is the boss".|`|AA10514087	i agree with the other posters but whatever you do try to  gain more confidence. with little to  no confidence she will try to take a hierarchic position in the herd ahead of you, which can be dangerous to you. always work with others present in case of emergency. look, the real thing is if you let her get away with any unwanted behavior, she learns she can do it... and she will over and over again.|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	Its cool if your a new owner, good experience:] now im gonna be blunt with you. she dosn't respect you. and a mare tends to be more moody any way. I would sugest some natura horseman ship which works with your horse and you. you can take her in an inclosed area (paddoc, ridding ring) and lead her around. Doing little things like stopping, and making her back up if she dosn't stop, or stops so close to you that she's practically on top of you...<br>  <br>  If you are afraid, let me tell you somthing she knows it. and this is a mistake most horse owners make. If your afraid she's gonna kick you, stay away from her butt. keep near her head. give her daily groomings. as for the head tossing, just keep trying. don't give up. if she tosses her head wait untill she stops then try again. this will let her know that you are NOT gonna give up, and you are above her. Have fun<br>  P.S. Look up horse man ship on youtube watch others it helps:]|`|Xobbmd7Saa	In reality, horses do not go too out of there way to hurt you intentionally. They are prey animals so they won't run up to you and start biting. However if you make it convenient, they may kick or bight. You need to show the horse that you are the boss. Some horses play chase in the paddock. Start by working in the stall to gain some confidence. Put a halter on her and hand walk her. I even think that doing some join up exercises under supervision may help your bond with her. (youtube joinup first) Brush her a bit in an open area preferably crossties if she is broke for them or in a wash stall. Once you are not afraid of her, it will fall into place.

Morning should be fine for a vet visit if it isn't serious.<br>  <br>  Is the other dog up to date on vaccinations?|`|GSf09ALBaa	As long as you are going to the vet in the morning you have nothing to worry about.

If it gets infected you could end up with some extra vet bills.......Hopefully you have a good relationship with your neighbor and they'll cover the bill.|`|TRganQA4aa	She should be ok - the same thing happened to my Bluetick male - the pug next door nailed him on the nose and drew blood.

8Rn2pX4jaa	What kind of shows are you going to be attending?  <br>  <br>  Considering she is still considered a "green" horse or junior horse, most shows allow you to use a snaffle bit.

If you have been using a D-Ring snaffle bit in english... that will be legal in Western as well.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|1HwyDyD0aa	If you need an "easy snaffle copper" bit, then what's wrong with the copper D you're currently using?

Have someone lead with an older, calmer horse.|`|DoS1Ow2jaa	I think you should be fine... to start young is not a problem as long as u are comfortable and you think she can do then your ready to go ...tho i would suggest you go out with another person or ppl for your first 5-6 outings|`|1HwyDyD0aa	I don't know what sort of level rider you are, but assuming you're fairly experienced and confident, I'd say you could go ahead and take her out on the trails - how long has she been going under saddle?  You said she rears "but not often" . . . do you mean a little lifting of the front legs off the ground, or a straight up rear?  Anyway, you don't sound concerned about it, so judging from the info you've given, I'd say go ahead and take her out with a calm horse she gets along with.  As for the schooling show, no reason not to take her.  At least plan to trailer over and walk her around (ride) the show grounds and see how she handles all the commotion.|`|AA12144656	I guess I'm more cautious than the others here.  I wouldn't take your horse out until you can control the speed.  When she does this take her in circles to make her work.  Do this every time until she knows if she speeds up, she'll have to go in circles.  The rearing is dangerous.  She may be "spook proof" because she is in her own territory.  It sounds to me like you need to train her more, so you won't have to worry about her running off with you, or rearing.|`|GksOStrsaa	I guess... The best choice would to just bring her in the trailer first and walk her around a bit so she gets used to the atmosphere a couple times, then just school, and then start with the greenies.|`|uEQ2LbQyaa	for the trail i would say yes but bring a friend just in case
PfmXPbFpaa	They will need their panleukopenia (feline distemper) and their rabies shots.  Rabies vaccines are mandatory in many counties and given at 4 months of age.  At 4 months, the kittens should be caught up on their vaccines.<br>  <br>  These cost me $20 a piece (2 panleuk boosters and 1 rabies = $60) plus the cost of a kitten exam (about $40).  The vaccines were only $11 a piece for my sister, it really depends on the vet.|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	call a local vet and ask 2 important questions.  What shots do they recommend the KITTEN to have and #2 how much.  Call a couple of vets for a price once you find out what shots are needed.|`|133a80b8f446ced791ae790df571f049aa	If you plan on letting the cat outdoors, I would look at getting it vaccinated against feline leukemia.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Avoid petstore, newspaper adds and online. Adopt and save a life, Don't knock the adults!<br>  Kitttens need you to be home alot-Max time away from a kitten is 2hours, Adults cat can be left alone max 8hours! Adult cats can and WIll bond with new owners, kitten cannot be rehomed until 8week old, 12week or longer is better before being rehomed.<br>  <br>  Have you considered the differences between cats and kittens? Many available adult cats are barely out of kittenhood themselves. They still have plenty of spunk and energy--they're just a bit more mature. That's a good thing. Here are 10 reasons why you may want to adopt an adult cat.<br>  <br>     1. What you see is what you get. Adult cats already know who they are. Kittens are undeniably cute, but you never know what the future holds, how large they may get, what their personality will ultimately be, etc. An adorable little kitten will be an adult in the blink of an eye.<br>     2. Adult cats aren't as "chewsy." Kittens have a tendancy to chew things, lots of things. Whether teething or just exploring bits of the world around them, kittens chew on shoes, the corners of books, ear lobes and fingers, carpet tassels, electrical cords, drapery strings, plants, and much, much more. Most adult cats don't chew inappropriately at all.<br>     3. If you have an older cat in your home and are looking for a friend for him or her, another adult cat may be the best choice. Kittens can be too playful and may upset your cat instead of providing companionship. A kitten may cause your resident cat to be more annoyed than amused.<br>     4. After a long day at the office, you may just want to come home and curl up with your furry friend--but most kittens prefer an action packed evening--lots of touseling, frolicking, and plenty of running and jumping. An adult cat will greet you at the door and be more than happy to curl up and watch your favorite shows on TV. They've already learned about the unconditional love thing.<br>     5. Adult cats may sleep at the foot of your bed, under the bed or in a cozy spot somewhere else in the house, while a kitten will most likely run around all night, doing anything possible to wake you up for more games. Adult cats are generally happy to sleep when you do and don't try to attack your toes through the blankets in the middle of the night.<br>     6. Adult cats won't be climbing up your leg or your curtains, they won't be swinging from your chandeliers, knocking down knick knacks or just running full speed ahead for no good reason.<br>     7. Adult cats are usually a better choice for families with small children. Kittens often play rough and are constantly underfoot. They're sharp--they can't help it, but kittens are all teeth and claws. Generally speaking, adult cats are more mellow, and often more patient with young children. The experience should be a good one for both the cat and the child. Ask to meet the shelter's best "kid cats."<br>     8. Adult cats require less attention and supervision. They're quiet companions. They have well-developed manners, use the litter box and the scratching post without constant reminders.<br>     9. Many adult cats end up in shelters due to no fault of their own. Separated from their loved ones, surrounded by other cats, confined, confused, and sometimes frightened, many are emotionally devastated by their misfortune. Sadly, most people gravitate toward the cute, bouncy, big-eyed kittens. Older cats sit by and watch, as one loving family after another passes them over for a cute kitten. Adopting an adult cat is a way to say to a deserving animal "I believe in you." <br>  <br>  For the abandoned, forgotten, and heartbroken adult cats, you just might be their last chance to have the love and warmth of a home where they can live out their years in comfort. When properly cared for, cats often live well into their late teens or longer. Typically, they will remain active and even playful throughout most of their lives. Once a cat adjusts to a new home where they can feel safe and secure again, they'll offer years of faithful companionship and unconditional love.<br>  <br>  Example of some of the cute adult cats available<br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=13068993" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=13068994" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=11274782" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=13074431" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=11016895" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/search/search.cgi?offset=24&zone=2&limit=25&zip=93266&animal=Cat&sex=F&age=young&tmpl=&lat=36.173729848188&long=-119.8244&preview=" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/search/search.c...</a>|`|871f0e15f0d49545f27f78f43647edd3aa	I got my cat when she was 6 months old so she didn't have to have a bunch of kitten shots.  When kittens are younger, they have immature immune systems and have to get more shots because the vaccines don't take like they do in an older kitten.  The cost varies depending on the vet you go to.  Call and ask.  For the 6 month old cat it cost:<br>  <br>  Rabies:  $16.00<br>  Feline Leukemia $15.00<br>  FVRCP $15.00<br>  <br>  Then, two to 3 weeks later, you go back to the vet for boosters of the FVRCP(another $15.00) and Feline leukemia($15.00).<br>  <br>  If your cat ever goes outside, it needs FIV vaccine which is $15.00, then a $15.00 booster.  Your cat needs this if you plan on bringing another cat into the home.  The vaccine is only 80% effective though so it is best to just keep the cat indoors.<br>  <br>  You will also pay an initial office visit fee at most vets. Ask how much it is.  I paid $25.00<br>  <br>  If the cat has ear mites, fleas or things like that, the Revolution treatment was $26.00.  To check for worms, I took in a stool sample that was less than 24 hours old in a plastic baggie, also kept refrigerated.  That was $16.00<br>    <br>  If your cat is indoors only, it still needs the distemper shot because you can carry distemper in on your clothing and flies carry it.  Rabies is usually the law.  Though in some places, they do not require a rabies vaccine every year after the pets first one year booster.<br>  If you are interested in other costs, I made a list in response to someone else's question.  I am listing the link.
AA10327148	The most successful shelters across the nation, have a "Seniors for Seniors" program. Senior dogs and cats are offered to Senior citizens at a reduced adoption fee, and sometimes for free. They also have a program for low cost or free health care for the pets of fixed income seniors.<br>  <br>  What this shelter needs is *volunteers* to run such a program, and raise funds and recruit foster homes dedicated to the Senior pet. <br>  <br>  Seniors citizens  usually prefer to have the companionship of  an older dog that prefers the slower walks and less strenuous exercise. Such a program is a win-win situation.<br>  However, the shelter can ONLY do what their community supports!<br>  If a *needed* program does not exist, it is the fault of the community, and not the shelter.  <br>  <br>  So, you asked, "how would I react?" I would speak to the director about working in tandem to start up a "seniors for seniors" program.|`|O4jGlC2caa	I would be upset and question this policy.  I understand giving the owners 10 days, but during those 10 days, someone should be allowed to place a hold on the dog.  Then the holder should be allowed 48 hours after the 10 day period ends to pick up the dog.  If kennels are empty though, they do not have an overpopulation problem.<br>  <br>  Let your wallet do the talking if they won't renegotiate their terms.  No more donations until things change.|`|XavY3fiWaa	I would totally tell her off!  What is going through that ladies mind, i would and i know lots of people that would adopt dogs over 5 years old.

Oh and what shelter is it?|`|VtHvcEtuaa	That is really an awful thing because I know MANY people who would rather adopt a dog over 5 years old.

The reason there is a high adoption rate in your shelter is because they keep the most adoptable dogs and don't plug up the system by keeping dogs that aren't going to be adopted.  Ever thought about that?<br>  <br>  That one old dog, that nobody wants, can fill up that spot in the shelter causing many, many potentially adoptable dogs to have no place to go.  If there's no place to go, they will either die on the streets or be euthanized as well.  Not to mention, the amount of money they'd spend feeding and keeping up with health requirements for that one dog.<br>  <br>  I know some people want to save them all.  It would be nice if there were the resources to do it, but unfortunatly there is not.  I believe we are doing the adoptable dogs a huge diservice by using resources we could put into saving them into keep very old dogs, aggressive dog and terminally ill dogs.  Do you realize how many dogs you could save with the money spent getting hip surgery (for example) for one dog?  It's not, in my opinion, a good way to use the limited resources we have.<br>  <br>  It's triage, it's harsh, it's not pretty and in a perfect world, this would never have to happen.  But this is not a perfect world.  And it's not a fair world.  And I think funds going into rescuing dogs should benefit the many, not the nessesarily the individuals.|`|iXijnCxOaa	Here its 72 hours and your dog is neutered and offered for adoption... in that time, they typically shuttle the dog between shelters so even if you look for the dog at one shelter in the morning and don't find it, it may be there in the afternoon before heading to another the next morning.<br>  <br>  and yes.. they euthanize those they don't consider adoptable including those with temperament issues, health issues or for age.<br>  <br>  While I think 72 hours is too short a time... ESPECIALLY since they do not take "LOST" reports over the phone and they require that you come in personally multiple times all whilst they are shuttling the dog between a couple of shelters (some only do adoptions, some do "incoming dogs", and other do the neutering... so your dog could feasibly end up in 3 shelters in 72 hours if someone brought it to an adoption only shelter)... I do agree that triage is necessary and adopting out the dogs most likely for success is necessary.|`|lDXh0jRVaa	I'm a shelter worker. I used to have the same viewpoints as everyone here is expressing but by working there I've learned some very hard things. <br>  <br>  #1 You no longer are able to do what's best for the individual animal, you have to do what's best for the shelter itself. You cannot try to nurse an animal back to health that enters the shelter sick because you don't know what caused them to be sick in the first place and you could wind up having to euthanize the entire building if it's something like distemper. <br>  <br>  #2 The public never knows the full story. You have no idea if these elderly dogs have an extremely low adoption rate so they euthanize them so they can adopt out more, younger dogs. If this is the case then that shelter is forced to euthanize more dogs than they would by using this protocol. If they say any animal over 5 has a low chance of adoption- they're right. People don't work in shelters to kill animals, they do it because they love the animals and are strong enough to make hard decisions. <br>  <br>  #3 Elderly dogs that have been abandoned tend not to have the best health record. I've found that almost all of our elderly dogs have some sort of problem such as liver failure, kidney failure, lymes disease, heartworm, thyroid disorder, arthritis etc. etc. They may be euthanizing for these reasons as well. No one wants a sick and old dog. If people are willing to abandon a dog they've had for 5 years or more then they haven't been feeding them well, providing them with a comfortable living space, or keeping up with vaccinations. <br>  <br>  #4 I'm POSITIVE that if someone came in to the shelter and saw that animal during the 10 days and expressed an interest in adoption they would adopt out the animal as soon as the 10 days were up. They don't WANT to kill the dog, they just don't have room. <br>  <br>  #6 Shelters do not have a large pool of money. They rely on the generosity of the community and what little money they receive from the state/county/town to keep running the shelter. Think about this: our adoption fee for dogs is $105. The spay costs us 75 or neuter 50, the vaccines cost collectively approx. 30, the lymes/heartworm test costs 15, frontline costs about 5, plus the cost of food and medical treatment they may need (and usually do). Also, you have to factor in how much they have to pay the staff. We're certainly not making any money off these dogs and if they're just going to sit around the shelter for months it's not fair to all the dogs we could have adopted out. <br>  <br>  #7 People do not come to the shelter to adopt, they come to shop. The difference is this:<br>  You go to a store and you have a gift card. Usually, you come home with something from the store whether you needed something or not. <br>  You go to the store and you do not have a gift card. Usually you went there with something in mind you needed to purchase. <br>  People do not come to shelters with open minds. They have a particular breed, color, size, shape, gender, personality, activity level, age etc. etc. in mind. No one comes to the shelter looking for an elderly, sick dog that is cranky and set in their ways. <br>  #8 The public doesn't know this but dogs go kennel crazy. What is this you may ask? It is when dogs literally go insane from being cooped up in their kennel for too long. The constant barking, lack of stimulus/attention causes them to start acting erratically. They start by snubbing food, soiling their kennel more often and developing quirks like refusing to come in the building after going to the bathroom. Eventually they start biting, lunging, and some even try to kill themselves by ramming their heads into the side of the kennel wall. What do you think? Would you want to put a dog through that hell? We sure as heck don't. <br>  And finally, <br>  #9 Elderly dogs usually have quirks. I find them endearing personally but by the time they hit this age it's very difficult if not impossible to teach them not to garbage pick, snarl at children, or lick themselves raw. People want young dogs that they can mold. They also think that elderly dogs will not bond to them and their family. <br>  <br>  So remember, things are always as they seem. You don't know what resources they have and despite them having a very high adoption rate/low return rate (which I'm not sure I believe that you actually know reliably) they may not have a high adoption rate/low return rate for elderly dogs. I know this is not what you wanted to hear but since you don't work behind the scenes you don't know what the full story is. Remember, they HAVE to have open kennels because legally they HAVE to be able to intake strays. We've had problems in the past because we've had too many dogs at one time so they have to live in crates. You know, the crates you keep your dog in that they can just barely turn around in when you go to work. That isn't fair to anyone. As awful as it is, it's better for the animal and the shelter if they are released from their misery. Ever shelter has to draw a line wh|`|7vJNHaskaa	Aww, that's just terrible. Just because a dog is old, doesn't mean that there isn't someone out there who would love to adopt it (or find it again..). The manager should be fired...definitely.|`|g36NU81raa	That's terrible! What if you were old and you wanted a quiet little old dog? And what if the owner had just lost their dog? That's really sad, I hope they've been told off.|`|fgxajTiBaa	I agree with a few of the posters here, as sad as it is working in a shelter one must look to the general animal population and not become so focused on individuals.<br>  <br>  Say for instance, we have this dog at our shelter who is WONDERFUL about 90-95% of the time. The other 5% of the time his behavior is questionable and he has exhibited some human aggression. However, with the right person he would absolutely wonderful. But will that right person ever come? Probably not, and unfortunetely he's probably going to be euthanized this week.<br>  <br>  The time that a dog who's adoptablity is low takes up could sometimes house 4-5 perfectly adoptable dogs. Is it fair to keep that one dog when you could adopt 5 dogs in it's place? I have learned a lot in my first month at a shelter and the most important thing I have learned is you can't save them all, but the ones that you can save should be the ones you are investing the limited amount of time and money that you have.<br>  <br>  So...while it is VERY sad that these dogs have to die, maybe instead of the community flipping out on the shelter, they should reevaluate how many BYB's are in town who are only adding to the shelter population.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	On the one hand I can see how this is upsetting...older dogs are so sweet and they do deserve a chance at a new home.  On the other hand I do think that many shelters do tend to waste resources on dogs that are not very adoptable and that those resources would be better spent on more adoptable animals.  Money is always tight at shelters and that is never more true than during economic slumps like the one we are living in right now.  While I think that older dogs should be given more of a chance than they are currently being given at this particular shelter there may be a reason that this shelter has a very high adoption rate and low return rate (ie they don't waste much time or money on dogs that have a low chance of being adopted).  Running a shelter is a heartless business.  Shelter managers have to make tough decisions about what animals get to live and which ones must be put down (even in "no-kill" shelters the manager must make the call on which animals they can take and which animals they must turn away knowing that those that are turned away will most likely be euthanized somewhere else).|`|YV1bOajXaa	Well that policy needs to change.  Why can't they give the owners ten days to claim the dog and then another ten days to go up for adoption or rescue from a breed club or other rescue group?|`|tnTxHVO5aa	I think that is bullsh*t.  I typically adopt "older" dogs.  The dogs should at least be given a chance to find a home.|`|D1beU6MPaa	This is a question I thought about before I decided to answer it. Where I live we have a TV station with a reporter that has a segment called "That's Messed Up". It is always a story about something in the area that is just not right. For instance, the county came out to some people's house, dug a huge hole and never came back to fix it. If you have something in your area similar to this, I would sure give them a call. B ad TV exposure does wonders sometimes. It usually will make them do a double take on their operations, and really does help solve a lot of problems such as this one. And this one really ticks me off!|`|eDySIDPQaa	1--Report this chick to your State Attorney Generals office...and your State Represenative can be brought in on this and also the Mayor....also, the US Attorney Generals office can get involved if the State does react fast enough<br>  <br>  she needs to be replaced now, the sooner the better......<br>  <br>  and her reasoning is so lame, dogs over 5 yrs of age are very adoptable, she is so cracked up.....<br>  <br>  I would love to have her name and the name of the shelter and town it's in, i will go to work on getting this stopped...she is killing dogs for no good reason...she will continue this till someone stops her...

scdOdaTKaa	As for teaching her not to eat things, it's just like teaching her not to potty in the house, or chew on your shoes.  You should try not to allow plants in the yard or house that are poisonous to her. She will grow out of it. If she does ingest something, you can induce vomitting using peroxide.  Force about a 1/3 cup in her and wait about 10 minutes if no vomitting force another 1/3 cup wait 10 minutes.  If still no vomitting just go to a vet. There should be emergency clinics open at odd hours that you can go to, they have other ways of inducing using a pill called Apomorphine.|`|3d9rSmc1aa	dogs are pretty hardy and as hard as it can be sometimes the best way is to let them learn for themselves. if she eats something that makes her sick, she'll learn soon enough to leave things alone. if you are concerned then ask a vet but she should be ok.
02A4qFXEaa	My dog has eaten 2 whole chocolate cakes (seperate occasions)  and a whole bag of tootsie rolls, and countless small candybars and things the kids leave out.  I was nervous each time he did it, but nothing ever came of it, not even diareah.  But my advice is if you are worried you should call your vet.  And keep a close eye on him.|`|o93EwErKaa	The toxic dose for milk chocolate is roughly 1 oz. per pound so your dog should be fine.

Dogs are naturally diabetic (so I've heard), that's why they can't have chocolate. My dog got into Valentines chocolate twice.

And a friend of mine has a little poodle that would get into her Halloween candy every year and eat all the chocolate.

A llama or alpaca would be a very good idea, I even know people who keep their horses in pens with cows or steers because it gives them something their own size that doesn't like to harass them. Because they tend to be easily spooked they need something that they don't think is a predator. A donkey or mule would also be a good friend for a horse, although very similar if you're not looking for another similar animal try something else relatively close in size and attitude.|`|6iuqhe4haa	I have mini horses as companions to my Haflinger.

Speak to the vet as soon as you can and get an informed opinion and discuss the options you have left. Enjoy him every minute of every day you have with him.|`|dE5fs9yzaa	I'm glad your taking him to vet. I've had cancer, twice, and am glad no one wanted to put me down! LOL...anyway..at 9 he's getting up there for larger dogs in age and fighting the cancer will effect him. He could of hit it and made it more painful then usual. Remember, animals don't react to pain like us humans. They can be in terrific pain and not show it. But if he's walking well and not actually crying, then he might just be sore. But go the vet anyway. Good luck and kiss you dog for me! ;-)
vAH98IE2aa	Yes Dogs can have neurological problems just as we do how ever there are many different reasons for the problem as well as various types of neurological disorders.. Most "Retard" states are due to trauma of the head or Injuries to the head as well as tumors.. You have a puppy that has no signs of dysfunction as the pup is functioning just fine.. You have a case of what I call "the inexperienced Dog Owner"<br>  Ok so even if you have previously owned dogs before I can see from your question that little to no training was necessary as you would never ask if your dog was retarded over these observations.. Dogs Bark at night Because They have very good hearing as well as sense of smell. He is either talking with other dogs from a distance up to a mile away or He smells another animal that is lurking around Smell can travel a ways and especially if the animals sent is drifting Upwind or toward your yard.. Just because you can not see nor smell or hear it does not mean your dog can't. Do some research on dogs this will help you to understand them better and what they are capable of. Also he is a puppy they CHEW it is called TEETHING ! They usually stop on their own However you can prevent him from chewing property and bedding by giving him something else to chew on such as rawhide USA beef bones or Lg Beef bones purchased through your local meat market. Also If he insist on chewing Items Spray a bit of Bitter apple on it, Give him a Firm Loud NO! eventually he will stop. Also depending on the age and breed of pup it is not a good Idea to leave him in the cold.. If you are worried about his chewing BUY a kennel and place him in a kennel in a barn, garage or laundry room so that he is not cold, and exposed to predatory type animals. Please get some expert advise from your local humane society on the PROPER care for Puppies as it sounds as if you jumped into getting a puppy before you should have.. I run a rescue center and Refuse to allow people to adopt before doing research on the animal and getting a veterinarian set up to care for them I also do 2 checks One to ensure that the owner is comfortable with the companion and a vet check to ensure they have seen the vet. If they don't they must relinquish the Animal back to the center.. Harsh Well it is because I don't want them to end up in situations where They were taken from in the first place. or end up back in worse shape than before. Get recommendations from your vet on local qualified animal trainers..|`|U50DSq7yaa	umm... they can be. but it sounds like your dog just needs a human to treat him right. he sounds like he's extremely bored, otherwise he wouldn't be so destructive. also, if it's FREEZING outside, why is he still out there? and he's a puppy....YOU have to teach him to act properly. otherwise, he's going to do what he wants. and no dog is untrainable. it may take longer with some depending on what methods your using, but every dog can be trained when done properly. so, it sounds to me like it's you, not the dog.|`|7g7goXTyaa	you need to work harder at it...<br>  get help from a professional trainer who will work with you and the dog. They will send you home with homework to do with the dog.<br>  <br>  The chewing will stop as the dog gets older.|`|bPeK2jaQaa	Hes probly just teething and he probly is trying to tell "LET ME IN THE HOUSE!!, IT'S FREEZE YOUR BUTT OFF COLD OUT HERE!!" <br>  its not his fault nor yours he just wants love and improvement, improve his life and so will yours.|`|7n523JW1aa	Actually dogs can be mentally retarded.

Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha!|`|i8RWcBcbaa	Yup, pretty much. I would recommend seeing your veterinarian.|`|TNfIP5Qraa	He sounds like a normal puppy.  They will chew things like crazy.  They don't think about the cold.  Also, about training, he needs your patience.  They learn by repetition.  If he is barking at the dark, he probably hears or smells something that your human ears or nose cannot pick up.  Be patient with him.  and use your spell checker when you post things online!  Just a little constructive criticism.|`|cETQuE9waa	There are dogs that may have some type of mental condition. <br>  <br>  Your dog is a different story.  I think he is bored, lonely and needs training.  Nope dogs just get bored out of their mind and shred stuff because they are so bored. <br>  Puppies need plenty of exercise and training. Take him to some obedience classes.|`|AA11148143	I had a perfectly gorgeous Irish Setter that was as dumb as a post.|`|GSf09ALBaa	I seriously think he is a lonely, frustrated dog.  He is kept outside in the freezing cold.  He doesn't get chance to come inside and be with the family.  He is barking because he is bored and wants attention.  And if he is not remembering something you taught him the day before it is because he has not learned it yet.<br>  <br>  Bring the puppy inside, provide a kennel for him, start obedience training him the proper way and no your puppy is not retarded, you just don't know what you are doing with this dog.<br>  <br>  In otherwords, it is the HUMANS fault not the dog.|`|xCSZ3M3Raa	Yes, a dog can be retarded.  I had a toy poodle that I had breed because everyone in my family decided they wanted one (family not living with me).  Well, she had 2 puppies one was dead at birth the other one was Hugh, the vet said she was throwing back to when they were first breed down from the big dogs.  Anyway that puppy was severely retarded, my vet said it happens in cases like that.  So I never bred her again.  Do you know his sire and dam? Are they ok?  You need to find out if you can, if he is actually retarded though, he will start having some health problems and you will need to  take him to a good vet.  Good Luck hope he isn't really retarded.|`|3zv2bbolaa	Your dog is lonely and bored because his owners have abandoned him outside and haven't taken the time to include him in their lives or train him.|`|Rva0ocMOaa	It's not him it's you.
RwXTJiTMaa	Most volunteer organizations are more than willing to let you help, even if you're underage - since you're not getting paid, it's not illegal.<br>  <br>  I would check the ASPCA's website for information. I live on the East Coast, and I know that here it's pretty easy to call the local animal shelter and just let them know you're interested in helping out -- they almost always need volunteers. But you might have better luck through the ASPCA or a similar organization.<br>  <br>  Another idea that might help you is this: I work with a disabled 21 year old (he can't really work because he had a brain injury as a baby) and we got him a volunteer position at a local dog groomer. He washes and grooms the dogs, and he loves it. I'm sure if they allow him to volunteer with his disability, then a groomer would definitely let a smart 11-year old like yourself help out.<br>  <br>  It's great that you want to volunteer -- that makes you a pretty darn awesome 11 year old! Good luck!|`|iembGsl9aa	Try looking up places in your area. <br>  I got to volunteer at a rescue when I was 15. <br>  But there r many places that wont take ne one till they are 18.|`|77zoyQ2kaa	Hi Adam,  at all the shelters I've volunteered at, you have to be at least 16 to walk the dogs on your own, but if you're younger you have to be accompanied by a parent.  The rescue group I work with loves having volunteers of all ages, but because we work with a lot of strange and unknown dogs, we always require that you have a parent or other responsible adult with you.  The shelter will probably want your folks to sign something, too.<br>  <br>  It's so cool that you want to go volunteer.  It could turn into a really fun thing for you to do with your parents.  You'll be helping animals and having family time, too.
guVczXfUaa	Bichons do have an unusual gait.  I've never heard of one skipping, precisely, but they do have a bit of a bounce to their step.  <br>  I have noticed that most bichons tend to stand with one front leg up when they are nervous or excited, and they frequently switch the leg they stand on.  Perhaps this is similar, only your dog is a little strange?  Lol.<br>  I really wouldn't worry about it.  If his legs are okay, then he's probably just acting silly.  And if he notices that you notice when he "skips" he'll keep doing it just to get your attention.  My poodle is like that, when I laugh at him, he'll repeat that behavior to try and get me to laugh again.|`|HGSMEgpBaa	i have a bichon also, his name is chester, he skips when he walks to.i guess that's what they do.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	It might be as simple as him having his spine out of alignment.  What I'd do if he was mine, was find a vet who does chiropractic on dogs.  My dogs get chiro treatments regularly (for racing related injuries) and they keep them pain free.  Their spines are worked on every time.  In any case, your dog should have x-rays to find out what's causing his pain - and he is in pain if he's walking that abnormally.|`|IRaIxWJKaa	It may not be the legs, it may be the knee cap on the back leg. Skipping is one thing they do to avoid putting heavy weight on the leg when the kneecap is 'floating', which is sliding off the area it's supposed to be. The floating is painful, and with some dogs it occurs sporatically, usually when extra weight is done with faster walking or running.  The kneecap slides, hurts, the dog lifts the leg up a few steps, then puts it down again.  <br>  <br>  A vet would have to have the dog on it's side, flex the joint slowly while feeling the kneecap, to diagnose this.  I have it in one of our cats, she walks hunched up when hers moves out of place.  The vet said it's far more common in dogs, and usually in the hind legs.  They're more apt to stop walking on it briefly.

vS1Z0inOaa	Turtles in Illinois include common snappers, a few alligator snappers (in the Mississippi river system), western and midland painted turtles, red-eared sliders, eastern and three-toed box turtles (and I think there are some western box turtles in a small part of Illinois, on the part that goes with the Great Plains, though I might be wrong on that), and some kinds of mud, musk, and map turtles.<br>     If you're wanting snappers, there are quite a few of them in rescues. It would be great if you could give one of these a good home. Try Turtle Homes (www.turtlehomes.org). I also know of a few online breeders. You could likely find them on your own too--they're on the streets all the time. Trapsusually work better for catching snappers than fishing with bait because most will just sit onthe bottom of  lake and snack on any hapless fish that swims by during the day but will actively forage for food during the night. These guys are voracious eaters!|`|ld2vmypNaa	2000 gal pond...ya lucky duck!!!!<br>  <br>  check out ''Austinsturtlepage.com'  for all info and care on all turtles!!!<br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  <br>  I have 5 sliders..<br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157612827773738/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a>|`|AA11089669	The turtles that live in Illinois are the eastern box turtle, painted turtle, snappers, and a couple other species depending on your area. If you want snappers in your pond, you're more than likely going to have to find them yourself. I'm not familiar with anywhere that would sell snappers. To catch them your best bet would be to get some bait fish of some kind and go to a place where you know there are several snappers and just try to lure them out of the water with the bait. Just be careful for obvious reasons. Also, if you do end up catching the turtles and putting them in a pond, keep in mind that you will have to stock a lot of fish weekly for them to eat so don't go through with this unless you are committed to providing the necessary food.|`|upNfdhz9aa	if you have a pond somewhere in your neighborhood, then there might be a mother snapper. I found my baby snapping turtle on the bike path. :D

Do you have a lab to properly analyze the caloric content of your food? What about the guaranteed analysis that must be listed in every label? Do you know what the percentage of protein your dog food contains? What about food trials?<br>  <br>  Making your own dog food is one thing. If the dog has a problem, it is your responsibility and you can probably fix it easily enough. But selling people a product is a whole different animal. If a dog ate your food and got sick, you would probably be sued, which would be the end of the road for you if you operate as a sole proprietor. If a dog ate your food for 3 years and then was diagnosed with some sort of nutrient deficiency, you would be in deep trouble too. <br>  <br>  So no, I would not be buying your food unless I could see that you passed all of the requirements that big dog food companies must pass before being allowed in the marketplace.|`|zeTGmB3faa	Only if the ingredients and nutritional values where listed and were in compliance.
bPdqwkpPaa	Perfectly normal.  Keep her safe and inside for the next 4 weeks and then get her fixed.|`|PM23RDycaa	Yes.

Just keep her away from any intact males and if you intend to spay her call your vet tomorrow to schedule her spay 3-4 weeks from now|`|miOor5SRaa	Yes, females can go into their first heat any where between 6 & 8 months. You should defiantly get her spayed next month!! When we spay a dog before their first heat we COMPLETELY ELIMINATE the chance of breast cancer ( yes, they get it too) after their first heat it reduces to 80% after the second heat though spaying will have no effect! Un-spayed females can also get something called a pyometra & can be fatal! So please spay once she comes out of heat!|`|72cf671deef399824501fac66047b900aa	Yes.  We recommend spaying around 4-5 months to avoid the first heat altogether.|`|EWXzNyk8aa	Yes, that is perfectly normal. Some dogs come into their first heat earlier than others. 6 months is about the earliest.|`|DU0F48B3aa	This is hte usual age a dog comes into heat|`|U50DSq7yaa	yes, that's usually when females have their first heat.
7n523JW1aa	No. But I give my dog, an African Boerboel, a thing called Dental Sticks. I get them at Petsmart and they work perfectly.|`|3p6wp7DYaa	Bad breath in dogs that have perfectly clean teeth is caused by either bad diet or some metabolic problem. My dog's breath is perfectly normal and it doesn't smell like anything, even though I haven't gotten to the point where he will let me brush his teeth yet (he's a rescue dog who's been with us for only a little over 2 months). <br>  <br>  You might want to rethink the food you're feeding your dog before adding on more chemicals to his daily nutrients.|`|AA10805458	There is another product called Oxyfresh.

mX0qaX3Eaa	It's not too late at all. We adopted our English/Stafford Bully at 2, after he had been terribly mistreated and used for fighting. He's been my best friend from the day I got him, he's close to all the family.<br>  <br>  You can change his name too, it's only the sound he recognizes so he'll get used to his new title pretty quickly. I won't suggest a name because you should choose one based on his personality and try to avoid macho/hard names, Bullies are great big jokers not evil 'hard' dogs.|`|OKiMkaxGaa	He can still bond with you and have a great relationship. And yes you can change their name. I like the name Dodger and Dechali.|`|7n523JW1aa	You won't have much of a problem at all. Let me tell you though it's important as soon as your get him/her to take him/her for at least a hour long walk. This helps them to get to know you and for you to establish that you are his/her owner. For names I'd suggest something you think of. That really helps make him/her your dog.|`|IdSqunZuaa	Adopting a 10-month old dog is fine. Dogs at this age are still very trainable.

Shelter dogs are often even more devoted to their new owners, it's almost like they 'know' they have been rescued. You will be fine.<br>  If you think of a name that has a similar sound to his own he probably wont even notice a name change.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Dogs - most dogs - will bond to their new owners regardless of their ages.  I got my Greta when she was 18 months old, and it didn't take but a couple of days for her to realize the owner had changed.  Now we have a GREAT relationship that I wouldn't trade for anything.  <br>  <br>  At 10 months, he's probably already house trained, which is a real plus.  And he probably already has some manners, which is another real plus.<br>  <br>  Just remember that in addition to loving him, you need to set up rules, boundaries and limitations for him, so that he knows right off the bat what is acceptable to you and what isn't.  You also need to teach him to walk at heel, and then walk him or run him at heel every single day.  And finally, you need to have obedience classes and then daily 5-10 minute obedience drills several times a day.  All of this will keep your dog perfect.<br>  <br>  As for names, how about Dakota, Cheyenne, Montana, River, Cody, or Casey?<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|5WgtYPv9aa	Yes the dog can have a great relationship with his new owner if you take anough time out of your day to love him and care for him he will soon love you! Also you can change his name being only 10 months old it will be easier than an older dog but it may take a while.|`|3d9rSmc1aa	dogs are amazingly adaptable to change, especially this young. <br>  once they figure out that you're the one with food and walks you will soon become number 1.<br>  my bullies had pups last year and were given some great names:<br>  chaos, tyson, bulls-eye, beefy and chunk.|`|7g7goXTyaa	No 10 Months is fine!!!!

Honestly if it is between giving up your dogs or feeding a lower quality food.....I think your dogs would rather eat junk food and live with you. <br>  <br>  Believe it or not, Purina One is perfectly ok to feed your dog. It is inexpensive and you can supplement with veggies and meats if you'd like. Don't beat yourself up over feeding your pets a cheaper food. Purina actually has put significant research into its diets. They have ultra premium brands and even prescription formulas. You can sleep well at night feeding it.<br>  <br>  I know some dodo bird is going to give me a negative comment but whatever. I would stay away from Old Roy and other grocery store brands. The reason being is that they often don't have a consistant formula and can cause serious GI upset.<br>  <br>  Nutro is not bad but its not much cheaper. I personally feed Science Diet, but I supplement with whole foods too. Frozen veggies retain as much nutrients as fresh. Dogs are scavangers so don't worry about feeding "by-product" because in REAL life thats what dogs would eat. Wild dogs eat a variety of roots, plants, entrails, insects and anything else they can scrounge up. <br>  <br>  When the economy picks back up, you can return to your Dick VanPatten's Natural Balance. Save today and Splurge tomorrow. Good Luck.

They aren't as territorial as the male bettas, but they will establish a pecking order, and fish that are higher up will pick on those closer to the bottom of that order.  Having just 2 means 1 is going to be picked on all the time by the other.<br>  <br>  In a 10 gallon tank, you should be able to keep 5 females, just add several plants so there's cover for any that are being picked on to hide.<br>  <br>  But a definite NO on them preferring small tanks, unless *small* is at least 5 gallons.

UIueiJnZaa	Hi I have worked for the RSPCA the last year.<br>  <br>  I cannot tell you the exact percentage, but I can tell you the approximate numbers that we get in our Welsh centre.<br>  <br>  We tend to get fluctuations in breeds, which will all come at once.<br>  At the moment we are having a lot of Labradors.<br>  <br>  The most popular breeds are in roughly in this order<br>  (I've had to group them)<br>  <br>  1) Staffordshire bull terriers, German Shepherds and Rottweilers<br>  <br>  2) Lurchers, Terrier mixes, Collies<br>  <br>  3) Labradors, Jack russels.<br>  <br>  <br>  We then have a lot of mixed breeds, and a lot of random breeds from the public.<br>  <br>  The Labradors get re-homed very quickly.<br>  <br>  Some of the german shepherds go very quick, but others tend to stay for quite a while.<br>  <br>  Staffordshire bull terriers get re-homed very quickly, but we once had one that had been in over a year.<br>  <br>  Collies tend to come and go.<br>  <br>  Jack russels go very quickly.<br>  <br>  Lurchers go averagely.<br>  <br>  Rottweilers go very slow usually.<br>  <br>  Terrier mixes tend to stay quite a while, unless they are exceptionally cute.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  <br>  And an edit to JS's response...<br>  <br>  A German Shepherd is an alsation... and the RSPCA has a non-euthanasia policy, so unless the dog is severely aggressive or un-healthy it is unlikely to be put to sleep just because it is 'no good to re-home'.<br>  <br>  We are very strict in our processes simply to reduce the amount of animals being returned to the centres.<br>  The RSPCA wouldn't have allowed the cats to be given as a Christmas surprise as they do not encourage animals being given as presents for obvious reasons.<br>  Home visits are necessary to ensure the safety of the environment where the animal is going to be re-homed too.<br>  As road traffic accidents are the main cause of cat deaths annually, it is understandable to why they do not allow cats to be re-homed to a busy main road.<br>  I understand that the RSPCA's policy is strict in some areas, but please remember that it is this way to ensure the highest welfare standards for the animal.|`|T5znNRjraa	The breed i've seen the most in a dog shelter is a Staffordshire Bull Terriors, and it's puppies that get rehomed the fastest, i think, if you want you can check out some websites such as, <a href="http://www.rspca.org.uk/," rel="nofollow">http://www.rspca.org.uk/,</a> <br>  <a href="http://www.woodgreen.org.uk/newhome.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.woodgreen.org.uk/newhome.asp</a><br>  Hope this helps. x|`|TWeUG8ukaa	I know here in the US there are all sorts of breeds in the shelters.

The Siberian Husky is one which mostly goes to the SHWA - Siberian Husky Welfare Association rather than an RSPCA shelter as they need an eperienced owner and take more caring for than say the Labrodor would.<br>  <br>  Sometimes its not just the breed which makes a dog become more likely to be adopted.

sHdsIUyWaa	Look at local shelters or chihuahua rescue groups. There is always a puppy who needs love in a shelter. Just because they are there doesnt mean they are not great dogs. I have 3 mini dachshunds, all came from shelters and rescue groups and they are the best dogs Ive ever had. If you buy a dog from a shelter they are much less expensive and the cost usually includes a spay/neuter, microchip, and shots. Good luck
AA11244754	if you have a really good vet that really knows what they are doing, then they can be spayed/neutered at about 8 weeks, but most vets would recommend waiting until about 6 months.

Breeding is frequently painful and/or distressing to dogs anyway, and even if you'd left them alone, it's not unlikely that they'd have done the same thing on their own.  Some dogs have even been known to panic when they find themselves stuck, and then you've got two very upset dogs on your hands.<br>  <br>  Hopefully you will have your dogs fixed now.  Only a very knowledgeable  person with a great love for their breed should ever consider breeding dogs.  So much damage has already been done, both in expounding the problem of homeless dogs, and in ruining bloodlines.  <br>  Remember in the 80's when Dobermans started going senile and turning on their owners?  Bad breeding caused a genetic defect in which their brains outgrew their skulls and the pressure turned them senile and aggressive.  Dedicated breeders are still working to fix that problem.<br>  Or what about Shih Tzus with strongly bent front legs and their bottom teeth sticking out?  Did you know that thirty years ago the breed standard called for straight front legs and a level bite?  Careless breeding has resulted in the mutation of the breed, and the standard had to be rewritten lest the breed disappear altogether.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I'm done ranting.

hC4Z8HIbaa	A Habitrail is entirely too small for a rat to live in. A rat needs at least 2 cubic feet of living space. And because rats need to live in at least same sex pairs, you would need a cage that is twice that size. A habitrail would not even provide enough room for the rat to turn around in. It would be like allowing you to live in a broom closet for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  If you want to get a rat, I suggest doing some research. The website below is a great place to start. You can get ideas of proper cages, diet, and where to get your rat, and ask other rat owners questions if you have any. I am a member there, and all our members are very knowledgable when it comes to rats. It is the best resource to have for any rat owner.|`|44kEtDvIaa	Rats will probably chew on the plastic. Check site below for more info on rats, including good links for rat habitats and health issues.|`|xyPpruSjaa	No, those cages are WAY too small for rats.

Pet stores do not sell rats by size because rats come in different sizes, they sell them by size because those are the different sizes of the different aged rats. Large rats you see in the store are how big any rat you buy will get. They are way too big for hamster cages. You need a simple wire cage if you're getting a rat, and you play with your rat outside the cage while you train them. <br>  <br>  Also, you need to get two rats because they get sick from the depression and separation from cage mates. Two rats will certainly not fit better than one rat.|`|RPaHObubaa	The tubes tend to be too small and they could get stuck, but aside from thit, they are great.|`|3fGZMZkTaa	The Habitrails are much too small for a rat.

AA10332192	No and not even a remote chance at hybridization.<br>  <br>  Sometimes fish sharing the same genus can cross breed and create hybrids.  In very rare cases, even two separate genus will create infertile offspring.<br>  <br>  In the case you list, you have fish from the same family - Anabantidae, but they will not be genetically or behaviorally compatible.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	No. Gouramis and bettas are in the same family, but breeding between the two shouldnt be possible.<br>  <br>  Besides, theres quite a size difference between a female betta and a male paradise.|`|9mlY5cB1aa	No. They are closely related, but it is not possible for a female betta to mate with a male paradise gourami (aka Paradise fish).|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	I don't think so but maybe......? they are in the same family.  I don't think it can be done but I am not 100% sure.<br>  <br>  The parrot cichlids is a hybrid.<br>  <br>  I found this <br>  Hybrids are still considered "taboo" in the betta breeding world, but I am seeing them pop up more so maybe that attitude will change..... what dogsnfish said is true "...if you aren't willing to put years into it....then you might be better off working with something else... Also, don't let people know what you are doing if you are trying to attain a new strain.....copy cats would arise. Just my opinion." I will not post pictures. Sorry, just try to google it and see what comes up. <br>  <br>  If you really want to do something new you will need the dedication to follow it through. About 5 years ago I started experimenting with bettas and blue paradise fish. Me and a breeder in Georgia met and exchanged ideas and stock,<br>  we recorded and documented our fish and did several experiments over the next couple of months, hybridizing paradise fish and splendens..... the result............ well......... very ugly fish......... lol....... did our experiment work.... ya.....<br>  We scrapped the project after 10 months and decided not to pursue it any longer. We had done what we set out to do.... so what im saying is if you want to do this keep it a secret in your fish room................ lol...........<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ultimatebettas.com/lofiversion/index.php/t29921.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimatebettas.com/lofiversio...</a>|`|25CAIGfeaa	NO
vS1Z0inOaa	It's really hard to say without seeing him myself, but I'd advise you get him to a vet IMMEDIATELY!<br>     It could be that his basking rock is abrasing his bottom shell and causing sores that have gotten infected. Basking alot is not going to cause this in itself and you should never take that away from him. However, a soft shelled turtle is more sensitive to rough surfaces, so you should stick to shale, resin, or wood basking platforms. Things like driftwood, ZooMed's turtle dock, ESU's reptile basking platforms, and cork bark are good because they're made from these things. Things like bricks, plastic, and many rocks are not good and can be abrasive. Do you have him in a glass aquarium? Some people have kept turtles in rubbermaid tubs and have reported that the tubs cause red sores.<br>     However, I fear that you may be experiencing the worst case scenario: septicemia. Septicemia is a blood infection which wil be fatal if it is not treated quickly with antibiotics. Usually the only symptoms of this is unpatterned red spots on the bottom shell (caused by bleeding underneath the shell) and a tendency to bask a lot. When turtles bask they get warmer and this acts like a fever to bring their immune system into action. You probably should increase his temps by 5 degrees to get his immune ystem into full swing until he can see a vet. There's nothing else you can do on your own.|`|2YIxnXXyaa	<a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/state_resources.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Info/st...</a><br>  There's a list of vets who treat turtles in different states.<br>  <br>  It could possibly be Septicemia.<br>  <a href="http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Graphics/injury.gif" rel="nofollow">http://www.austinsturtlepage.com/Graphic...</a><br>  <br>  It could also have scraped itself while getting out of the water.<br>  <a href="http://aqualandpetsplus.com/Turtle116.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://aqualandpetsplus.com/Turtle116.jp...</a><br>  Soft shells have sensitive skin, especially their plastron.<br>  <br>  Either way, you need to take it to the vet.|`|yb0ROdR3aa	mine had on but then went away i dont know|`|AA10043485	Softshell turtles easily get fungal and other infections- they are considered very difficult turtles to care for because of this.<br>  <br>  Red spots often indicate blood infections- which need a vets care.
Rw7gi86Naa	All female cats, (or queens) that have not been spayed will come in heat, (or estrus) at stages in their lives. This may happen from as young as the age of 4 months and recur seasonally, (usually summer seasons with more daylight). The cat stays in heat for normally 4-6 days and during the summer season will come in heat again every 2-3 weeks. These periods may vary widely. The cat will come out of heat and the cycles will end once the cat has mated or the season ends. After giving birth a female cat may come in heat again in as soon as 7 days although this usually happens after about 4 weeks. <br>  <br>  How to tell if your cat is in heat<br>  It is fairly easy to tell when your female cat is in estrus, because all cats in heat display similar symptoms. <br>  The first sign is that the cat will become overly affectionate and rub her rear and even head or neck against all objects, other cats and her owners. <br>  The easiest and most obvious way to tell when your cat is in heat, is the call. Your cat will produce a very different, loud long howl. This is to let other male cats in the area know that she is in estrus and her calling will continue until she mates. <br>  A cat in heat will also bend her body in a mating position, with her rear raised, tail in the air and tread around in the same place. <br>  She also lifts her tail and sprays urine on objects. This is usually done on vertical objects like walls, doors and furniture rather than on the floor or carpet. This urine usually has a more serious odor than the odor left when urinating normally. Cat urine produced when in heat contains more estrogen, and this extreme cat urine smell lets male cats know your cat is in heat. <br>  If your female cat shows most of these above symptoms, the chances are almost 100% that she is in heat! <br>  Male cats that notice a female cat in heat will also change their behavior. They will become more restless and also spray their urine on objects. They may also start calling and howling, becoming more aggressive and territorial.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cats that live indoors live longer, healthier lives. Statistically, the life span of an indoor cat averages 12 to 14 years, whereas it is only about four years for the outdoor cat. More than 1 million outdoor cats are killed each year by dogs, traffic, and exposure to disease. In the long run, keeping your cat indoors will also save you money in vet bills.<br>  <br>  There are many risks that come with letting your cats roam free outside:<br>  - They have a much higher chance of catching diseases and other illnesses such as: Feline Leukemia (FeLV), Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP), Feline Herpes Virus (Rhinotracheitis), Feline Distemper, Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), rabies, tapeworm, ringworm, heart worm, hypothermia and urinary tract infection<br>  - Ingesting chemicals or poisons such as pesticides, home garden products and car/motor products<br>  - Getting fleas or ticks<br>  - Injury/death due to dangerous traffic <br>  - Eating poisonous spiders, insects or plants<br>  - Injury/death due to cruel humans, hunters or neighbors<br>  - Attacks from dogs, other cats or wild animals <br>  - Other accidental injuries<br>  - Getting lost or stolen|`|RN1wGlWWaa	I do hope you find her - she's far to young and little to be let outside alone.  Kittens as young as 4 months old can breed and get pregnant - they don't have to be in heat either.<br>  <br>  If you find her, take her to the vet and spay her immediately.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Both male and females can breed From 4months old, however the normal is 6months old for females and 4months old for males.|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	I never understood why someone would let out a cat to begin with. Its one thing to let them out when they are older for a few minutes, even an hour.  But it's been 3 days, the kitten is a young thing (4 months) and it doesn't sound like you've been out  canvassing your neighbors to see if they saw the little thing. By the ways it's too young to be in heat.  Now you have a pet that you didn't research before you got it. to even see what you were getting into!
pDSde3qdaa	I don't know how to explain to tell if one is pregnant but you do need to know not to pick her up after she's gets big.  It can hurt her and the babies...  And I'm thinking a guinea pig is pregnant for about 60-75 days.   But please be careful with her and also know that she can be in heat as soon as she has a litter so watch remove other guinea pigs before she delivers if she is.<br>  <br>  Here's a few more tips:<br>  Remove males when you are expecting the new babies. <br>  Keep an eye on other female guinea pigs around the new babies, though they're usually fine. <br>  Stand by in case the mother needs you, but don't intervene unnecessarily. <br>  Guinea pig mothers are not usually aggressive towards humans handling their babies, and you should handle the babies from day two onwards, to socialize them. <br>  If the mother doesn't have enough milk or refuses to feed any of the babies, try feeding them a special baby formula, mashed cucumbers, bananas, and almond milk. Feed it to your babies on a small spoon, or goats milk. <br>  If you hear a soft noise, like a groan, from the baby guinea pig, it might be suffocating. Perform gentle resuscitation on the guinea pig's stomach and use a straw to blow air into her mouth. <br>  While the sow is pregnant be sure to give her fresh fruits and vegetables daily especially if young. All guinea pigs should be given 1 cup of vegetables per day for proper nutrition, fruit should be fed more sparingly. The best vegetables/fruits for guinea pigs include various types of lettuce (not iceberg), carrots, green and yellow bell peppers, and small amounts of tomatoes and strawberries. <br>  Make sure you are feeding your guinea pig high quality pellets, like Oxbow, without nuts or seeds mixed in. Guinea pigs should also always have timothy hay to eat. <br>  Make sure you and others keep away from the pregnant sow so she may be in peace. <br>  If you have a extra room in the house, put the pregnant sow in solitary ... she'll appreciate it. <br>  Some pregnant sows enjoy company of a younger sow or boar. <br>  All guinea pigs including pregnant sows need good ventilation. <br>  Even though they are pregnant they enjoy plenty of running around time ... so make a schedule for them to play! <br>  Don't clean the cage out when she has her litter and before she has them!! <br>  Make sure she is HAPPY:)!!! <br>  DO NOT SQUEEZE HER <br>  Try not to pick up the pregnant sow to much!|`|849ab583f8b9c949dafa10ca68eb4c11aa	if shes older than 10 months your gonna have probs if she hasen't had a litter before. but take her out of the cage and put her in another one if you dont have one then get one.

G0KKfXMUaa	Yes, she has GREATLY improved! Congrats =)<br>  <br>  Though, she needs to fix her hands. She kind of allows them to go up and down with the horse. And at some points, they're on the horse's neck, or it looks like that, and are too low. But good job!<br>  <br>  Edit-<br>  <br>  Kowds 122 is somewhat wrong, somewhat right. (in the last video) as she cantered after the first jump, she was leaning a little foward. But she is in NO WAY leaning too far foward over the jumps. Actually, she's sitting up quite a bit. So, don't worry. She's not on the horses neck over the jump or anything at all (you can clearly see that in the video), but just work on sitting up well after a stride from landing.|`|pnDZcQKpaa	yes, her jumping is improved and so has her seat. but, she's getting WAY too big for him<br>  hope i helped :)|`|DoS1Ow2jaa	Yes i do think she is better|`|JFuVm9k5aa	she has improved, yes but somone needs to teach these young riders to SIT BACK!!!!!!<br>  going up to any size jump is suicide if your up the horses neck. oh gosh.<br>  <br>  anyway, her seat and hands have improved. she looks better overall but can somone please teach these kids to sit back? i'd hate to see that sweet little pony of your stop and see her lose her front teeth for eating a wood post!!!<br>  <br>  and in the youtube video you said your horse does not go on the bit? why is that? he should be trained to carry him self like that. it is in the best interest for him and the rider. he goes around very hollw and his jump looks a little uncomfortable because of this. he needs to bring his withers up, bring his hocks/legs under himself (the kind of run along behind him) and raise his back.<br>  just wondering....i've never heard of a horse not being capeable of collecting in the proper form but maybe he has a previous injury or something. <br>  sorry, i know you asked about the rider but im not sure it is her fault for her eq. someone obvi. didnt teach her how to sit back and wait for the horse. she is kind of hurting the horses jump by laying on him like that. how is he gonna bring those darn withers and butt up with her laying on him? <br>  <br>  anyway, she neeeds to sit back and that horse needs to get himself in a correct frame and they would make a nice pair. <br>  <br>  on the plus.<br>  <br>  he seems like a sweet guy, i wouldnt tolerate someone flapping around and layong on me.<br>  <br>  and for her, its not her fault no one taught her to sit back before letting her jump :)|`|MInCz0Keaa	She has imporved since the 1st one but needs to get on the right diagnol and has some things to fix but she HAS improved|`|b608c67e75221c1e151eb7fa81d3410caa	Yes, definitely improved, but I would still shorten her stirrups one hole.|`|F0nRMmmlaa	Oh yea!|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	she's gotten much better!<br>  <br>  she just needs to sit back more and when she does lean forward her legs need to stay in the correct spot they kind of tip back a bit. and her stirrups are a bit too far back in her foot.<br>  <br>  other than that, she's gotten much better!|`|shKh9mnUaa	Definitely!!

Otherwise, when you take her outside and she poops -make the biggest deal out of it - tell her she's such a good girl and give her treats -- dogs love this kind of affection so she will want to make you proud again.

You have to be careful with males cats as they tend to be prone to crystals in their urine and this can be a medical emergency if left untreated. Signs to look out for are abnormal urine patterns( like weeing in the bath, carpet etc) check for any blood in the wee and also look for straining and some people mistake this for them being constipated. Also if he has been under stress in the house, new cat around outside this can trigger it all to. He also may not like the little that is being used. Have you changed his litter brand?

rbLdJ6Iiaa	i started horseback riding western, but i've been doing english this past year and i love it so much more. i feel like i'm in much more control over the horse, and i think a lot of horses are more attractive when they're ridden english. the saddle to me feels more comfortable, and i have so much fun :) i would go with english 100%. western is ok but i prefer english. you can do tons of stuff with english that you can't with western. its up to you, though.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Wow lots of english here :)<br>  <br>  I like western best.  I don't think all the people saying it is boring really know what they are talking about.. No offense guys but sounds like they have not really explored western. I consider advanced western to be version of dressage. I can perform many of the same moves on my horse with the exception to a few.  It takes having a very similar amount of discipline and control of the horses entire body.<br>  <br>   It can be very simple to very challenging and tedious.  I enjoy reining which is advanced western which takes alot of work to achieve a good Performance.<br>  <br>  I also do trail coarse which can be very tricky even on a well trained horse.  And It actually does require going over poles and small jumps at the lope. Including side passing over poles dragging things backing through objectss etc.  It is alot of fun.<br>  <br>  Most people are thinking of western pleasure which is laid back and easy going.  But there is also gaming events, poles, barrels, and you can even get into cow horse event, roping, cow penning(Which is really fun!), ranch work. I ride on a drill team.<br>  .  <br>  So there is alot to western.  I do enjoy riding hunt seat as well and even some English pleasure to.  It depends on what interests you but I really like western and all the types of riding I mentioned above.<br>  <br>  I hope you find what you really enjoy,<br>  Jenny|`|JFuVm9k5aa	i like both because they both should have the same basic foundation. all horses in any discipline should be able to do lower level dressage and go in a correct frame (including neck, back, hind end, hocks, stifles, neck, and poll)<br>  <br>  i PREFER english because i event and that is a lot of fun because you get three great sports. i like team penning on my QH and cutting is awesome on a really well trained "cow horse" which yes, my maclay eq. horse is also a cow horse ;) haha. (he is a QH and has done open hunters, equitation, level 3 dressage, level 7 jumpers and evented pre-lim... AND has done team penning, cutting, and reining. he is multi talented eyy?)<br>  <br>  anyway...<br>  <br>  i like them both, if you and your horse are good at a certain sport you really appreciate the athleticism the horse brings to the table and watching/feeling them do their job is intoxicating. rather it be cutting or jumping in a grand prix field it is all awesome.|`|G0KKfXMUaa	For plain old fun- I love Western. It's more comfortable and easier.<br>  <br>  For jumping, a clean preformance/better look- English. <br>  <br>  Well this depends on you, though. Do you want to show in jumping, dressage, etc. or just have fun with riding, or perhaps barrel race, etc.? Once you decide, then make your choice.|`|Yz2OHyblaa	english.i guess because im in new york and im into jumping.western is kinda boring.u just sit in the saddle and go|`|7c4ea61e236a43cc2894889b9893fee8aa	Western is easier, but English makes me feel cooler.

You can also race, use gated horses, many things. It's much easier, the saddle is less heavy. I find it simpler.<br>  <br>  But I also like western. You can race across a field in a western saddle, you can do barrel racing, gymkhana, cattle roping, many things as well. Also, its fancier, you can match your shirt to your saddle pad if you want.<br>  <br>  Both are fun, but I'd go with english with western as an optional fun event.|`|DesVTR26aa	Western doesn't have many options. All the turns and stops and other stuff like that in western riding is applied in English jumping.

Good luck with your decision!|`|D0zrK0JCaa	well to tell you the truth i like different things about each. well i can't give you an answer on this because it is your preference. I do endurance riding. if you can't choose i would go and take a look at it, it is supper fun i have met some of the greatest people of the horse world doing endurance. plus, in endurance you can have any horse, and any tack. you don't need show clothes you can wear what ever you want i love this because you don't have to do get dressed up or get a perfect horse or have the perfect position. but good luck with your choose|`|nfDgJDgbaa	I LOVE english!!!! first of all you get to learn A LOT!!!!!!

5WgtYPv9aa	Your cat is just playful try buying feather toys or any other kind to see if he's interested in attacking those instead of you. Your cat needs to learn that attacking you is not fun when he go's to attack you dont pay any attention until of course it hurts then take a toy and try to distract him.|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	Maybe it's his way of wanting to play. get him some toys.|`|9fb74469d3f937feeed0a568c9da83feaa	He is not attacking you, he just wanna play, give him some toys !!! <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck !|`|NGmRMqe6aa	Pounce and kill are normal cat games. You are his playmate but you don't know how to be a very good cat. Pounce and run is called tag and they play it with claws and teeth. You need to get some toys that lets you two play together with out blood letting. My favorite toy is a fish pole with a fake mouse as bait. I mean go to the bass pro shop get a Zebbco and go cat fishing, He will love it and you will no longer be attacked to play.  The minute you pick up that pole he will be ready and willing for fun.|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	Cats are like children and they need to be told off then they are naughty. Sounds like he is trying to walk all over you and he thinks he is boss. When he does it try putting him in a place on his own like the bathroom,laundry so he knows what he has done and that its wrong. Also if that doesn't work get a water spray bottle and squirt him when he does it. I did these things with my cats and they even understand "no" like a dog. U can train a cat!! I did Good luck|`|AA11990721	It all depends on the cats history...maybe the cat was abuse when it was little? or it could be that your coming at him to strong....come at him slowly and always let him decide if he wants to be held or not...things like that could improve your relationship with your cat|`|3XEJM8Nxaa	Because cats are crazy sometimes!

fgxajTiBaa	First thing DONT BATHE her until you find the best thing possible. You might to just deal with it tonight and tomorrow you can buy some peroxide or Nature's Miracle Skunk and Odor Remover. The thing with skunk smell is if you wash them once and it doesn't remove the smell, as soon as it dries...it's stuck and it is MUCH harder to remove. It's much like a stain where if you wash it and it doesn't come out, as soon as it dries it becomes that much harder to get out. If there is anyway you can get some peroxide tonight try to do so, otherwise I would get some clothes pins and plug up your nose for the night!<br>  <br>  Add: Tomato Juice absolutely does not work at all, it is an Old Wives Tale.|`|AA10972366	PETCO sells a deodorizer by Natures Miracle with a formula specifically for Skunk scent removal. Awesome brand!|`|qzPZf2XPaa	Step<br>  1<br>  Keep your dog outside if possible. It could take weeks to remove this noxious odor from your house.<br>  Step<br>  2<br>  Check her eyes. Skunk spray can irritate them. If they are red and irritated, add eye drops designed for humans to relieve the irritation.<br>  Step<br>  3<br>  Don rubber gloves and wash the dog thoroughly with dog shampoo. Rinse and dry her.<br>  Step<br>  4<br>  Douse her with tomato juice, which diminishes the stench. Use enough to soak the fur thoroughly. It might take several cans. Allow the tomato juice to soak in for 10 to 20 minutes.<br>  Step<br>  5<br>  Rinse out the tomato juice. Reapply it if the odor lingers.<br>  Step<br>  6<br>  If the tomato juice doesn't work or if you'd rather drink it than wash your dog in it, try a mixture of hydrogen peroxide, baking soda and regular dish soap. Use about 1 qt of 3% peroxide, 1/4 cup baking soda and a drizzle of dish soap. Mix it well and add a cup of water if needed and then lather up your dog right away.|`|pc7ZjexJaa	that just happend to me last week!<br>  tomorrow take your dog to petsmart and they will groom her<br>  <br>  as for your home....spray skunk-off EVERYWHERE it will eventually evaporate.<br>  <br>  we rubbed our girls down with ketchup to stop the irritatoin|`|DU0F48B3aa	vanilla extract in shampoo and use beer as a conditioner<br>  Also most important get rid of the colar or harness and buy a new one|`|JsBb732Maa	There is a skunk shampoo you can buy from a pet store, UG!

bPdqwkpPaa	The truth of the matter is that it can't be left up to your 14 year old.  In a year, her life could be completely different.  Either with modeling, school, life, boyfriends, friends, or whatever.  <br>  <br>  The amount of traveling also concerns me.  Dobes are one of those breeds that are not well-received in all places.  If you plan on traveling with the dog, it may be harder to find places that will accept him.  <br>  <br>  I also don't see any dog experience with step-mom & dad.  Since they will be the ones training the dog and responsible for it, they need some sort of extensive dog experience.  Dobes are hard headed and test boundaries.  They need a considerable amount of exercise and constant upkeep on the training. <br>  <br>  I agree that dobe rescue is a great place to start.  Talk with them.  They are going to be honest with you if they don't feel that a dobe is right for your home.  If they feel that way, don't take it personally.  There are hundreds of other dog breeds out there that may be a better match for your family.  GL!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dpca.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpca.org</a>|`|3giaPYe8aa	Well, I've had 8 Dobes over the last 25 years, and your situation does sound pretty good.  It sounds like you are researching and asking a question here that is actually an intelligent one, in comparison to most.  They are a very loyal and smart dogs.  I just wanted to add one thing that you might want to check on.  OK, I have a very close friend that has both purchased two Dobes from me and we had a co-ownership on a show Dobe.  She moved to Florida a couple of years ago. (Before had lived in MI and NJ with Dobes.  She had a real hard time with finding homeowners insurance with having 2 Dobes.  You might want to look into this.  Good luck with all.  When looking for a reputable breeder, please go to the DPCA.org website and check out the breeder referral list for Florida.  There are several very good breeders in your state.  Just don't be shocked if a pet quality pup is around $1500.00.  That is about the going rate for a pup with ears already *show cropped*.|`|24CFl7sjaa	I think you would need to look at how much time you are planning on travelling and whether taking the dog is an option. If you do go away and will be leaving it in kennels a lot then maybe not a great idea.|`|72cf671deef399824501fac66047b900aa	Contact your local Dobe rescue organization and talk with them.  Or go to your local shelter and ask to talk with a placement counselor.  They'll be able to help you even if you don't adopt from them.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|UEHsqSaTaa	If you can train it and handle it then it's fine!|`|Ky3rQ3fYaa	My family has had dobies for over 20 years.  They are so smart and loving.  THe last one we had was an abuse rescue and that poor fool couldn't get enough of traveling.  He was awesome with company and when out in social situations, desite being abused.  If you want to take the dog traveling a lot he will have to be well-socialized and not put in a travel cage all the time.  The dog will love being included because by nature they are pack animals and see "their families" as part of the pack.  Being left out can cause them a great deal of anxiety.|`|bPeK2jaQaa	I think that right now a big dog would not be the best idea, maybe a small. if your daughter is close to a major model or is setting off right now would not be the best type though is you really like the breed you should get a mini pinscher. They are just as good and based off the same breed!!|`|sBfiRXPQaa	First I HAVE to clarify something stated by "cutie p"... a minipin (Miniature Pinscher) is NOT a smaller version of the same dog!  The minipin is actually an older breed.  <br>  <br>  That said... I've had many dobies over the years, they are my favorite breed for their size, tempermant, coat, intelligence, and willingness to travel with me.  There area  couple drawbacks:<br>  1. you have to be prepared to train a strong breed dog<br>  2. you may have trouble with homeowner's insurance<br>  3. you may have trouble staying at certain facilities with this breed<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the dobie is still looked at as the "junk yard guard dog" by a large segment of our population.  This is changing, but too slowly... <br>  If your daughter (or you) are willing and able to train this dog and give it LOTS of exercise, then I say go for it!
6KxBqnstaa	Keep her warm by placing a heating pad under the bottom of the cage and a blanket halfway over her cage. Call avian vet and make apt for her to be seen. Let her eat all she wants to and drink as well. Is she going to lay eggs? No male bird needed for that. Until get to the vet I would dim the lights keep warm and check on her often. But vet as soon as you can. Good luck.|`|CP3IiHG3aa	I'm sorry I dont know much about birds but if she has the same symptoms as your other one the I would take her to a vet asap.|`|FzFMoeSkaa	dont be one of those people who constantly repeat themselve even when there posts have been answered correctly. <br>  TAKE HER TO A VET!!

If you can't get her to the vet today, keep her warm until you can. There are suggestions on how to do it at the website I've listed.<br>  <br>  www.birds-online.de has an excellent symptom checker--there's much more there than I can explain in one post here. The site is budgie-specific, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

wDmNpO8Gaa	I'd get down to her level, meaning lying down on the floor while you offer her a treat off of your hand.  Don't look at her in the eyes because to dogs that's a threat and if she's never had human contact she'd feel threatened.  Let her smell you and on her own term come to you.  If she hides in the laundry room, lye down there and keep her company without asking her to come of trying g to pet her.  The dog needs time to get used to you and your smell AND to trust you.  Little by little introduce other people and sounds to her in the same way.  <br>  <br>  I have a cat that I adopted two years ago.  he was abused and had lost a leg.  He was very skidish and scared to death of sounds and people.  I started by lying on the floor where i knew he was.  I offered him food and treats and let him come to me.  I turned on the radio while i wasn't home so he'd get used to sounds and voices.  Visitors would come on occasion and he'd hide.  Nowadays, he comes out and greets them.  He's total cuddle and sleeps with me.<br>  <br>  Try this consistently for at least a month and see how your dog turns into a more social and trusting dog.|`|BfBMRlNNaa	Does she like to play any games? Maybe start throwing a ball for her or Frisbee. Do something she will enjoy. In addition to that I would always make sure that you keep your voice down when interacting with her, try not to startle her with sudden moves. Make sure that every thing you do together is on her terms. Give her lots of verbal praise when she comes around and let her come to you. Wait for her to make contact rather than reaching out to pet her. This may take a while to change, but be patient. I'm sure she will come around!|`|riCfCxjEaa	What you're doing so far is good.  Arm all guests at this point with small bits of yummy treats.  have them toss a few treats to her without looking at her or engaging with her in any way.  Unfortunately, this seems to have been an unscrupulous breeder and I would avoid them at all costs in the future.  but what's done is done and now, we just have to get this baby trusting you.  Soon she will be coming up to guests because she will be looking for treats, when she starts coming up to people, have them hand feed her treats but again, soft talk with very little eye contact.  Direct eye contact is threatening to dogs so a sideways approach without any is the best bet.  this is going to a long process so please be patient.  She needs to associate all people with good things!  Good luck!|`|AA11244754	Honey, she was either part of a puppy mill or was owned by a hoarder and she learned NOT to trust humans.  My roommate has a dog that was a puppy mill dog and she has had her for 3 years and she hides under an end table.  She is still skiddish and has only fairly recently started going up her my roommate and asking for loving but you can still see the mistrust and fear in her eyes.  She may never really trust a human because of how she was treated.  This dog does the same thing.  Just be very patient and loving toward her and whenever she does actually comes up and gets even a quick light head rub or ear rub, praise her lavishly as well as praising her lavishly for just sniffing your hand.  <br>  <a href="http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u205/sexyisback08/Pictures012609ofdogs004.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i169.photobucket.com/albums/u205/...</a><br>  this is her and she probably will never trust anybody ever which is sad because this is a result of her having been a puppy mill dog.
ZvKw1XDmaa	Completely normal, if they are still acting up in a few days, give your vet a call.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	Did you just bring them home?  Give them a day or so.  The whole thing for them was probably pretty stressful.  Whenever I have to board my cat, he hides under the bed for 2 days when he comes home, and that's not even for surgery.  Of course you should call your vet if you're concerned.|`|YDt1PFDcaa	I've had many cats that have come back from the vet stunned after being neutered or spayed. It's totally normal for them to either hide or act a little irritated. The best thing to do is just to leave them alone and let them heal. Make sure they have fresh food and water near by and maybe even move their litter box closer to them. They'll be as good as new in a day or two.|`|t8W2wf52aa	They should be alright, when cats get spayed(or neutered) they usually act odd for a day or two. If there still acting weird after a week, I would suggest that you call the vet and just ask him, if there is something to be worried about. Good luck, I hope your cats feel better soon.|`|b50Oz78caa	yes, give them a few days to come out of the anesthetic.  it takes cats longer than dogs to come out.<br>  <br>  if you have concerns, you should also contact your vet.|`|FBl2Dp3eaa	yeah
tShDXmgbaa	I do a fishless cycle for a period of 24 hrs maximum and in goes the fish. I do not use test kits either.  I have never had any deaths occur from this method.  It just depends on what works for you.  I just et up a 10 gallon tank yesterday and today  I added some Albino Sail Fin Mollies, Salt "n Pepper Platys, Lemon Albino Swordtails and about 6 Asolene Spixi snails. No deaths no problems.  I see no sense in cycle a fish tank with nothing in it for days/weeks so I take the risk and cycle 24 hours and in with the fish.  What works for one may not work for the next person so the choice is yours.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	There is no point in using live fish for the cycle. Using live fish will not speed up the cycle. <br>  <br>  Major con- Using fish to cycle your aquarium subjects them to high levels of ammonia, and nitrites. In any amount ammonia is lethal to fish. They will suffer from ammonia burns and poisoning.<br>  <br>  ~Even a fish classified as hardy is not immune to the harsh effects of ammonia.<br>  <br>  ~I have heard enough negative comments about it that I knew better than to use a fish cycle. No up to date book on aquariums would suggest using fish to cycle. I work in a pet shop and have had many customers complain about the lethargy, black spots, and death of fish added too soon. It's so easy to avoid.|`|vZv60NJ2aa	Fish less cycles are much better cycling method to use. This because, obviously, no fish is involved - with a fish cycle, fish are exposed to large amounts of chemicals such an ammonia, chlorine and nitrite. During a cycle with fish, most of them will die due to contamination, stress and stress-related diseases. <br>  <br>  To perform a fishless cycle, simply go and buy some ammonia from your local pet store, and add a couple of drops each day to your fish tank. This will promote the growth of the amonia-decaying bacteria in the fish tank. You can also add fish food to the tank, sounds silly, but it releases ammonia when it decays. The ammonia levels in the tank will rise to a peak point, and then decrease to zero. This is when the amonia is converted into nitrite, which is even more poisoness chemical to ammonia. As the bacteria in the filter build up, these levels will also decrease. Test your fish tank each week for ammonia and nitrite, and when you finally test the fish tank and the results for ammonia and nitrite are zero, it is safe to add your fish to their new home.|`|r4Ggo4jJaa	fishless pros-you are not hurting any fish<br>  -you won't have to do as many water changes in the process<br>  -you won't have to buy danios<br>  <br>  fish in pros-you can add a couple fish right away<br>  cons-you will probably kill some nice fish for no reason<br>  -millions of water changes that slow down the cycle<br>  -if your fish don't die they will suffer from amonia burns/gill damage<br>  -your 'cycling' fish will likely not b healthy when you are done with them and your pet store won't want them back so you will be stuck with them.  this will limit your stocking choices<br>  <br>  ETA-amonia levels rise in the water during a cycle and this burns the fish, regardless of how hardy it is.  fish stores are not all that knowledgable. they are trained to sell fish, not to do what's best for the fish.  yes, i have killed some fish doing a fish in cycle but would never do that again cause i know better.  instead of just beleiving what the pet store tells you, do some research on your own.|`|asXq2cFDaa	Fishless is better because cycling with fish can give them permanent gill damage, and if you do not monitor the tank closely they can die.<br>  Does not sound like a responsible pet store either, they treat their fish like disposable pets, and not real creatures.|`|pcvcMePXaa	well i do both  fishless cycle and fish cycle, 2 week fishless and 2 week fish. i find this helps doing both and never have any problems in all my 3 years of keeping fish. id suggest doing both and you can sell the fish back so good luck
vZv60NJ2aa	I am a skilled aqua scaper, so I will be very helpful answering this question.<br>  <br>  Sand of fine substrate works well with plants, it allows them to root well, and to take up the nutrients effectively. Spread the substrate to that it's deeper at the back, and shallower at the front. This will create depth in your fish tank, Then, place decor and plants towards the back, this will allow an open area at the front of the tank for the fish to swim, and an area at the back where they can go and hide. In my fish tank, I use some oxygenating plants, and very long, leafy plants that flow naturally with the waters currents.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|00RgkZF8aa	I just answered a question like this so I'll just copy and paste my answer here:<br>  <br>  Here's a great guide with pictures:<br>  <a href="http://www.albanyaquarium.com/library_LuisSetUp.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.albanyaquarium.com/library_Lu...</a><br>  <br>  And here's some more guides:<br>  <a href="http://www.csd.net/~cgadd/aqua/art_plant_newtank.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.csd.net/~cgadd/aqua/art_plant...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aquahobby.com/articles/e_plant.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquahobby.com/articles/e_plan...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aquarticles.com/articles/plants/Dunaway_Planted_Tank.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aquarticles.com/articles/plan...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.plantgeek.net/article_viewer.php?id=17" rel="nofollow">http://www.plantgeek.net/article_viewer....</a><br>  <a href="http://www.fishcrazy.co.uk/wikis/beginners-guides/setting-up-a-planted-tank.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.fishcrazy.co.uk/wikis/beginne...</a><br>  <br>  Here's an excellent forum about planted tanks that I suggest you join if you need any help with your tank: <a href="http://www.plantedtank.net/forums/" rel="nofollow">http://www.plantedtank.net/forums/</a>|`|r4Ggo4jJaa	need to know how many watts of lighting is available and what type of bulb is being used. will check back l8r

Some of the recommendations are based on what types of diseases are common in your area.  Others come from the old school thought that says if a little is good a lot must be better.

Some more progressive vets are going to recommend a very slow progress and not give "combo" shots unless absolutely necessary.<br>  <br>  If the breeder you're getting your puppy from is a good reputable breeder, they should have a vaccine program in place and your puppy should have it's first and possibly second vaccination by the time you get her.  If you're getting the dog at a pet store, DON'T!<br>  <br>  If the breeder doesn't have vaccine recommendations, they probably don't know much about animal health and you might want to look elsewhere.<br>  <br>  Healthy puppies get a good immunity from their mothers, and unless seriously stressed or exposed to unhealthy animals, a routine of vaccinations every 4 weeks or longer can be beneficial.  <br>  Your puppy is more likely to encounter sick animals at the vet's office going in for exams/ shots than they are likely to encounter them in public.|`|AAZ3sNCgaa	Puppies receive vaccines in a series, similar to boostering vaccines in humans.  These can start as early as 6 weeks, but the average age to start their vaccines is 8 weeks.  Regardless of what vaccines or care the puppy may have when you do adopt it, it should have at least a physical exam by a veterinarian.  At this time, the veterinarian will talk with you about puppy care and vaccines.|`|mw3woRpwaa	Honestly there is no set age because it depends on what vaccines your pet has already had. Your vet will tell you when the series is complete. Vaccinate for Distemper, Parvo, Parainfluenza, Hepatitis, Bordetella, Rabies and if necessary Leptospirosis.|`|o93EwErKaa	The puppy shots typically are given at 8, 12 and 16 weeks.  Some vets carry out the vaccines to 20 weeks, but usually only in those breeds very susceptible to parvo like dobermans and rottweilers.  The vaccine is a combination vaccine for distemper, adenovirus 2, parvo, and parainfluenza called a DA2PP.  Depending on the area, lepto is added (DA2PPL) and/or corona DA2PPL-C.  Also referred to as a 5 way, 6 way or 7 way.  The rabies is a separate vaccine only given once usually at about 4 months old.|`|bIaywrBCaa	they should have had all shots completed by 12-16 weeks old.
eDySIDPQaa	Of course the fresh air is best for the dog, but in this case, I say do it, there is nothing wrong with the treadmill at all.....just make sure when the poor dog has a hand towel wiping off it's little face, you stop for the day...or if the dog is holding on for dear life and back legs are dangling off the treadmill, I would say has had enough for one day<br>  <br>  and on rainy bad days, to keep the dog fit, sure use it...just so it is not a permanent thing, cause the natural exercise would be best..all that good air in the lungs you know..smog, car fumes, dust, LOL<br>  <br>  I have a treadmill,and on really stormy, wet days, my dogs use it, not a thing wrong with it.<br>  <br>  and thanks for caring enough to at least give the dog exercise on bad days or until has had last round of shots.....better caring then sorry<br>  <br>  good luck.....|`|KxjUim7yaa	I think they are fine if you are supervising your dog. Some people wander off and the dog gets in trouble. Show people have been using them for years. I don't need one, but if I lived in an apartment or were in your situation, I would consider it. Just the added exercises will burn up calories for your dog. Don't cut his food too much.|`|VmLZFN4Taa	Haha..Do you have a cat? I taped a piece or paper to the treadmill and turned it on and my cat kept trying to chase it.<br>  <br>  I think walking your dog on a treadmill is great, especially in your situation.|`|hbj6vGE4aa	Your 10-12 week puppy is overweight?  Uh, buddy..they are puppies, they are supposed to be chubby!<br>  <br>  As for the treadmill, I don't really have a problem with it when used properly.  Some dogs really just need to burn off some extra steam even if they get a walk or two a day.  A treadmill should never take the place of a daily walk, dogs need to get out and sniff around.  And another drawback is that the human doesn't get out for a walk either!|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	It's not the best form of exercise, since fresh air from a walk is great. And there is the injury factor. <br>  <br>  As long as there is no other option right now, and you intend to walk him as soon as you can, there's no problem. It's better than no exercise at all.<br>  <br>  It's when you get to the owners who are too lazy to walk their own dogs, so they just stick them on a treadmill where you get the problems.|`|ErjSVRkqaa	I think if you can walk your dog outside, that's the best thing to do! Because dogs love to smell things and chase things and see new things. Dogs love to run around outside. Heck, I get bored running on the treadmile. But, for someone in a situation like yours its fine!<br>  <br>  Wow....he needs to loose weight that young?|`|nFcl0BOsaa	I think it is an excellent idea, and there's no time like puppyhood to get him accustomed to one. <br>  <br>  Do socialize him to the outside world -- especially meeting other dogs, being handled by other people including careful children, greeting the postman -- by 16 weeks of age.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	most vets will tell you that puppies burn enough energy just being puppies<br>  it is like a young horse- you don't ride or exercise tehm until they are older and the bones are more set<br>  has be been properly dewormed?|`|V5ZpqRs8aa	I dont know why people would have a negative attitude towards it. I do it all the time.|`|uEQ2LbQyaa	i think it is funny i tried it with my cat she just sat there|`|9zepHeieaa	My dog loves it too!|`|GUEsVdaFaa	Personally I believe it's a wonderful idea. Most pet owners aren't responsible enough to care that their pet isn't getting enough exercise, and I think it's rather honorable of you to take such precautions for your puppy. It's too bad there aren't more pet owners like you who take into consideration all of their pet's needs, and then respond to them. Kudos friend!<br>  If I could get my puppy to walk on our treadmill I would but it's old and he's scared of the noises it makes. I can't always get to a park because I don't have a vehicle, and I can't walk him down the dirt roads where I live for fear of being ran over by the super intelligent drivers in my area. We play in the house and in the yard but I know it's still not enough. So, I plan to begin my second attempt at treadmill training in a month or so when he's a little older and more settled down.<br>  <br>  If you need information on how to train the puppy to walk on the treadmill I can do a little researching for you and forward the sites to you that I've found and am using. From what you've wrote I would assume you've already figured it out though. Once again I give you kudos!! Keep up the good pet-ownership!|`|I6y85ckmaa	There is absolutely nothing wrong with giving your dog some excercise. I bet half the people who gave you negative answers don't take the time or even care to think about keeping their pets active and healthy. I don't think any higher or less of people who walk there dogs on a treadmill.|`|MsHIb2oLaa	If your pet likes it and enjoys the exercise I don't see a problem with it|`|U50DSq7yaa	it is completely and totally okay to walk your dog on a treadmill. as long as the pace is comfortable for the dog. tons and tons of trainers and behaviorists will tell you the same thing. and it's also smart of you to still get your dog the exercise it needs in a way that is safe for him if he isn't fully protected by his shot series yet. and if he enjoyed it, even better.|`|8Y583Fluaa	as long as u stop when thier tongue is hanging out thier mouth and thier eyes popping out|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	He needs to lose weight at such a young age? <br>  <br>  I don't have a problem with the treadmill, as long as it's not over done and it's entirely supervised..
tShDXmgbaa	I like fish because watching them is a big stress relief. No having to go out in the hot/cold for walks, no pooping all over the place & they are just so cool. If you do not like them...give them away or take them back to the store. Whats so hard about that????|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I love animals in general, but fish in particular are especially fun to keep and watch. <br>  I like that you can create an environment for them to thrive in. They are beautiful, and different. There is so much variety, that everyone can find a type that suits them. Plus I really enjoy aquascaping.<br>  <br>  Goldfish are not boring. Mine are gorgeous, and take food right from my hand.|`|x3ly5oSdaa	I like to watch them swim. I sometimes imagine my self in the water. Actually studies have proven if you have high blood fish , its quite good to buy one or two fish and watch them swim for 10-15 minutes, because it causes your eyes to move and it lowers blood pressure.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	I like goldfish they are smart fun fish but I don't have any because I like  all the options of keeping tropic fish. But gold fish are cool. Black moors are my fav|`|Ssxe6a5jaa	Nothing. I have had six fish and two frogs and I am ecstatic that I no longer have to take care of them.|`|GMtoiRRmaa	well they make great sushi|`|r4Ggo4jJaa	i like the sound of their filter, it sounds like a water fall. i like that i have planted their tanks so there are nice little gardens in there.  i like watching them play around and interact.  i like that they are quiet and don't poo or shed all over my house.  they don't beg for attention or scratch up my stuff.  i like how different species have different behaviours<br>  i don't much like goldfish though. they are one of the messiest fish you can buy and not all that entertaining unless you have a massive hundreds of gallons tank so you can put a large school in.  i prefer smaller schooling fish and fish that actually have personalities.|`|x5tOxNz9aa	I like fish becasue they are fun to watch, they add a little scenery to a room, they are easily maintained, they are colorful, you can add new fish.<br>  they don't need constant care, and handling like dog, or cat. LOL, now having a fish as your only pet, is a bit boring I admit|`|WXduJP08aa	ok well they are east peasy lemon sqeezey to take care of and there fun to mess with and when you talk to them it looks as if they were living and when they die you dont freak out
V5DON3XGaa	ha ha yeah, especially if someone was like allergic or something and they died! that would be awesome! oh, what would be even funnier is if the dog was aggressive and mauled the kids to the point where reconstructive surgery couldn't fix them. not kill the thou, just so they are horribly disfigured their whole lives. so whenever they go out everyone stares and tells them they should live under a bridge. that would be great. thanks for the laugh!|`|bIaywrBCaa	no dogs are allowed in school so the answer is NO.|`|MQNYKISWaa	I would totally ask. All of my dogs are under 5 pounds, so I dont think that they would say no.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	My cat got on the bus with me once and I didn't know tell I looked down and my friend was like Dude.. Isn't that your cat?.. Ha ha. I had to bring him all the way home and then go back and I live 8 miles out of town! Ha. The bus driver drove me back. It was crazy.|`|T0pkW783aa	Hmmm!  I don't think they would allow it but, if I were a child, I would certainly try to get them to let my dog stay!!  That is pretty funny!!|`|p7oi3P06aa	i would ask if i could take em back home. if they say no then id do it any way.|`|dYluozLHaa	I ONCE TOOK MY TOAD TO SKOOL............THEN HE JUMPED OUT OF HIS CAGE AND WE HAD TO FIND HIM =)|`|Kt0qVNZOaa	Yes! I would ask if my dog could stay! My dog loves everyone too. He would love to be around new people petting him all day.<br>  <br>  What kind of dog do you have?<br>  <br>  Add: aww sweet!  A beagle? They have the cutest eyes. Yours is that friendly? Wow. The beagles I've met have been timid.|`|U50DSq7yaa	i took my hamster to school once when i was in the 7th grade. just put it's food and water in my purse and made a little bed for it. don't know why on earth i did that to this day... but it definately alleviated some of my boredom.|`|U6Lai0DIaa	Lol... yeah I'd ask if my dog could stay... I don't want to walk allllllll the way back home when I just got there.  lol|`|UEHsqSaTaa	No but I'd ask if i can walk it home to my house.|`|MiQ9Bgvxaa	well it deepens on if the teacher is nice
mpGjPV6Xaa	Take the cat to the vet and find out what's wrong with him. First thing you should do , is make sure it has its shots. <br>  <br>  Joseph D : )|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Yes I would report this person - no way should this be going on in a rescue group!|`|tDU347knaa	Yes, you should.|`|sOkePjK3aa	Yes you should! You know puppy mills? Yeah , well it's the same kind of thing except this is cats. Report it, then the cats will get loving, caring homes and will be out of those cages! Good luck, hope this helps!|`|ihOIHE5Aaa	Yeah, call the Humane Society, ASPCA, or animal control in your area. Crazy cat ladies aren't good.|`|4aAhEK9daa	What do you mean by "supposed rescue"?  Do they have a physical shelter or are they a "rescue support group" where they just take cats out of shelters and foster them?  <br>  <br>  The shelter should be checking on whoever's fostering their animals to make sure that they're being kept properly.  Obviously this woman is far from doing that.  And if the home really smelled that bad then they haven't been there in a long time - if ever.  <br>  <br>  Contact them ASAP as these animals obviously need to be removed from her.  I would also contact your local animal control and file a report on this woman.  <br>  <br>  I do hope you don't have other cats in your home other than this cat.  If you do whatever diseases or infections this cat has can be easily passed to them.|`|NGmRMqe6aa	No rescue Society would knowingly  condone what you have told us. Tell them immediately so the cats can be rescued from this horrible place,  In fact tell everyone that will listen, shout it from the roof tops  tell the media. And wow for you to take him from that to your loving home. You are what we need . You are my hero.|`|QDZjhTGqaa	yes, they shouldn't be a foster parent if they can't provide proper care.<br>  They are required to hvae enough food, water, shelter, space and tlc for each animal. Try to get a hold of the rescue they foster for or report them to an animal sanctuary.|`|mtBRZaezaa	whaat! <br>  i think you should !<br>  like, badly . 30 cats in small cages, and it does not seem like they are kept in a very nice environment ?!!<br>  POOR THINGS|`|ZvKw1XDmaa	Yes, they are obviously neglecting the animals proper care.|`|7vJNHaskaa	Of course you should report them! That's terrible. It's great to hear that you saved one from that life though.|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	I think you should if they are in such bad conditions like that.|`|dWed21jUaa	Report it. Sounds like a cat hoarder or a kitty mill|`|9LNtTfmgaa	YESSSSSSS|`|1jUHQxWmaa	I most states, there is a restriction on the number of animals that you can have in a house. This means that you should definitely report this person, as they are probably breaking the law. <br>  And of course, with conditions like those, they are probably breaking all sorts of animal protection laws. At the very least, submit an anonymous tip, because you could be saving these animal's lives|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	Yes, you need to report this person. Your little kitten may have a cat flu infection thats why his eyes look a bit funny. Check him for sneezing also. Take him to a vet for a full checkup<br>  <br>  Its heartbreaking to know that cats are living in these conditions and if you report it, you will help them :)<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|4663e238a9f0f6994b5cc3db58c86e60aa	If you feel something is not right, you might be able to put in a report. A lot of people illegally harbor too many animals. She should have some sort of permits to have a rescue. The cats may be getting neglected. It sounds like she's overwhelmed.|`|tSQ2kD0haa	I would definately let someone know about this. That lady shoudn't be allowed to keep animals in those conditions! That is just horrible.|`|t8W2wf52aa	That would probably be considered animal cruelty, you should probably contact animal control, and explain it to them I am sure they would like to know about it.|`|NmzWCCdLaa	This is horible, you should definetly say something about this to the organisation or the RSPCA. I'm a cat lover to so i hope they get out soon.|`|FKqd96Biaa	I would call your local animal department and have them investigate the place.|`|5LoWcL6Laa	yes ...they will get them taken ...that is awful....probably have a better chance on the streets with what they must be spreading to each other in there!|`|o4SbMz3Caa	yea i think u should.Cuz they rly should not treat them like that.Well..ones outta there..but wat about the 30 others?..u should definatley report them!|`|tTxz7KKpaa	yes u should asap this is not a way to treat any animals cuz u treat ur pets like u treat ur family|`|lSMOx9C5aa	yes this type of abuse is terrible and cant be tolerated.

XZoYjav9aa	Well first things first, call your local vet(s), find one that is a comfortable driving distance, and has a staff you like. Once you have found a vet, you should schedule an appointment a few days after you get your puppy (give her time to settle in with you first), to ensure that she is in fact in good health, and while your there, the vet will be able to tell you when you need to get the next round of shots and any other medical questions you may have. <br>  <br>  You will want to get a Small Breed Puppy food. I like the brands that have food for their entire life time, from puppy to adult, to senior stages. Its easier to transition them with the same brand. <br>  <br>  One thing I would really really really think about doing, is puppy training. Especially with such a small dog. And its more for the socialization of your pup, get them used to people and other animals and everything you possibly can get them used to now, you dont want a dog thats scared of everything and becomes a fear biter. so socialize socialize socialize!!! Plus training, is never a bad thing lol, the younger you start the easier it will be. just be consistent. if you dont know where to find a trainer, the vet should be able to give you some resources.  <br>  <br>  another good thing to do is to play with her paws, get her used to people holding her feet and messing with her toes, so that nail trims will be easy for her and you her whole life. i cannot stress this enough<br>  <br>  fo course you will also need, food and water dishes, toys, bedding, collar (for a puppy that small you can get a kitten collar which will fit a bit better until she gets a little older), leash,crate,  and anything else iv missed this far. <br>  <br>  Have you researched the breed? If not i would do that as well, every single breed is different. so make sure you know the breed. <br>  <br>  I also forgot to mention, the day you get her home, before she even gets into the house, show her where you want her to "potty" let her sniff around the yard, and do her thing. and the second she goes potty make sure she knows that that way the right thing to do. praise praise praise, by doing this before you have even taken her into your home, she knows good things happen outside, also eliminates her messing in the house the first few minutes. <br>  <br>  and speaking of house, i laso forgot to mention, puppy proof. meaning, if you have bunches of chords in certain areas like by a tv, you need to band them together and best thing to do would be to tape or nail them to a wall shes going to be tiny so she wont be able to reach to high, but those teeth will be sharp. so do anything you can to clump cords together and keep them out of the way, make a blockade if you need to, make sure you have no cleaners that are easy to get to, check under the furniture  for anything she could eat, chew on, or choke on. make sure she has a space set up before she even gets there, crates are a good thing to have. and NEVER use a crate for a time out spot. that need to be her get away spot. safe place. make it a very good area especially if shes going to be crated during the day. a good way to do this is once she is settled and has scouted the land, is put her in the crate with the door open let her sniff there, and get used to it. then put her in here with the door closed for a few seconds and let her out, then a few minutes and let her out and then, move to putting her in there for a few minutes and leaving the room then coming back and letting her out. gradually increase the time span with you not being in the room and every time she is being put in there or being let out make it a very very good positive thing (the process with take a few days but its worth it in the long run) - baby gate any rooms with hazards that cannot be removed or just keep the door closed. just make sure everything is ready before she is there. and dont try and overwhelm her with love and attention until she is used to you. dont force her into situations quickly. just make sure the first few days are as clam and nice as possible. these first few days are very important if you want a confidant, happy, health pup. <br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck with your new puppy!!|`|EhPRMuziaa	Usually right after you purchase a puppy, you make an appointment with a vet. They tell you all about the vaccines and shots your puppy will need and at what age your puppy needs them. <br>  It's also helpful to buy a book about the breed of dog you are buying. They sell books at almost every pet store and you might want to read up on Chihuahuas before you pick up your puppy.<br>  Good luck!|`|eT3a3jeLaa	i agree with the last comment, read books about Chihuahua's. With a puppy i would get mushy canned food so its easier for them to eat. Do not buy hard food yet, its too hard on there mouths when there puppys. You can give your dog pills for heartworms, not shots sometimes! ask your local vet|`|KsQ2EftYaa	You need to interview several veterinarians before you get the pup and find one that you are comfortable with.<br>  <br>  If the breeder is a good one, they will have written guidelines that you should use to help keep your pet healthy.  That's part of a good breeder's job.  If not, walk away and find another breeder.  It will turn out better in the long run. <br>   How to find a good breeder of Chihuahuas?<br>  Go to AKC.org, click on - Breed clubs, then click on - Chihuahua-this will take you to the Chihuahua breed club where you should be able to find breeder referral - some are better than others, but if you're getting a good quality dog, most breeders near you would be willing to be a mentor to a newbie.  Most good breeders however will not support buying from a backyard breeder.  <br>  You can Also visit dog shows in your area.  Find a breeder you really feel comfortable with.|`|KxjUim7yaa	First you get the dog and then you take her to the vet for a wellness check. Take a stool sample with you. Find out what shots were given they should have been a parvo and a distemper complex. The vet will give you a schedule for other shots. Heartworm requires a blood sample. There can not be any before starting a preventative. Get a good flea preventative from the vet too. I think the best food would be Innova EVO for puppy. It is grain free.|`|AA11244754	try actually researching a puppies needs instead of taking the easy way out by getting on here, which you should have done BEFORE deciding to get a pet NOT after then panicking.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	okay- you need to start with a good vet- they and their team can guide you thru your questions and give advice on how to keep your pet healthy<br>  this is the brand we feed<br>  <a href="http://www.royalcanin.us/products/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.royalcanin.us/products/defaul...</a>|`|mw3woRpwaa	Make a veterinary appointment immediately. Chihuahua's are prone to a number of health problems and you should have a licenced veterinarian take a look. Mainly check the knees for luxated patella, the skull for open fontenelle, and honestly if it were me I'd run a bile acids test too for liver shunts. You vet will recommend vaccines. Typically a DHPP (Distemper Hepatitis Parainfluenza Parvo), a Bordetella, and generally a booster of the DHPP in 3-4 weeks. Generally your next booster is when you vaccinate for rabies. You vet will also deworm your puppy. Let him no matter how many times the puppy has been dewormed before it won't hurt her. The number 1 cause of blindness in human children is round worm infections.<br>  <br>  Heartgard is good for heartworm protection, but there is also Revolution and Interceptor. There are lots of brands. If you have small children, make sure you pick one that kills round worms too.<br>  <br>  Also consider a flea prevention program. Remember an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.<br>  <br>  I feed Science Diet but other companies I recommend are Eukanuba, Royal Canin, Purina, and Nutro. I'm a science girl and I need doctors to tell me what food is good. I don't follow hype. Feel free to add healthy supplements too. Dogs love carrots, green beans, chicken....Just make sure you don't offer unhealthy food items. Also remember chocolate, onions, grapes, raisins, human breath mints and gum can be deadly to your new puppy. Xylitol is super dangerous, it is found in gum and mints, so watch out.<br>  <br>  Enroll in a puppy training class ASAP....again an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Chihuahua can be very aggressive if not properly handled and socialized. With the right training, they can be amazing companions. Congratulations and Good luck!!!<br>  <br>  Oh I almost forgot. No rawhides and puppy proof your home. Remove all potential choking hazards. Invest in a baby gate or two if it will make it easier for you. Puppies chew everything and you don't want to have an unscheduled trip to the vet.<br>  <br>  Also consider metal or ceramic feed/water bowels. They are easier to clean and harbor less bacteria than plastic.|`|nZj78jvYaa	okay so it sounds like you are getting your chihuahua from breeder who is starting the process for you i have a 2 year old chihuahua and i prefer to get the iams dog food but that is also one of the only brands she will eat.  Chihuahuas can be picky. there are alot of sites that will tell you what is or isn't needed. the best course if you are getting the dog from a breeder is to talk with her. i treat my dog for heart worm, i get most of the shots how ever my breeder advised me against lepto. the kennel cough is also a optional vaccine if you never plan on boarding or grooming in a facility. just google chihuahua and you can get alot of information.|`|ppVT5QC7aa	I have several chihuahuas. I raised one from a week old and she just turned a year old a couple days ago. I feed her benieful puppy and now she gets regular. She is happy and healthy. Get the person you are getting her from to give you a list of what shots she has had. Take her to the vet and tell them the shots she already has and let them tell you what others she may need. Chihuahuas love to play. Buy her some small squeaky toys. They are also very fragile. Hope you enjoy her as much as I do all 3 of mine.
p3vjvzRPaa	Other answers give you some tips for how.  There are lots of websites and books to help too.<br>  <br>  But, while my dogs are highly trained (compete in obedience) I don't walk them off leash.  I let them off at the park only.<br>  <br>  Why? Because even the best trained dog is not a robot.  Things happen when you're out walking and all it takes is the dog running off just once and something awful could happen.<br>  <br>  One of my dogs about 10 years back was hit by a car.  She was a brilliantly obedient dog, but she ended up on the road because a stray dog rushed up to us just as I was taking her inside (so I unclipped her leash on the front porch).  She went into protective mode and chased him off...straight onto the road.  It all happened so fast, and she was running 'on instinct' so didn't respond to my commands as quickly as normally.  (I was lucky, she was OK)<br>  <br>  It was a good lesson for me.  <br>  <br>  If I could rely that there would never be a stray dog, or a cat, or some other form of wildlife, or a person doing strange things, etc etc then I'd walk my dogs off leash,  but because I can't guarantee what may happen, I love my dogs too much to risk them, so the leash stays on.<br>  <br>  A leash isn't really an inconvenience and they get to run free at the park, so I don't see it as a big deal to walk them on leash compared to the risk.|`|18f339d2d88d8a05cc418425220b52e1aa	Before you do any off leash work your dog needs to be 100% on leash.  The idea of off leash is doing on leash work & unsnapping the lead from the collar as you are doing your obedience work out & see if he is really paying attention to you & doing right with out the lead.  He should be watching you for his clues as to what is to happen next & not paying any attention to anything but you.  He will preform well if he is taught well. <br>  <br>  This would be advanced obedience work & it takes some time to get there.  You & you dog both will need to learn a lot before any off leash work is done.  If you start too soon & mistakes are made it will be harder to get him back on track.|`|b60b6e8062f11f6cf697468a2c93558aaa	You will first need to teach him to walk next to you (heel) while on the leash and once he learns that command you can move on to without the leash.<br>  <br>  Here are some tips that might help;<br>  Begin practicing in a distraction free area away from other people or pets.<br>  <br>  1. With your dog on your left call him and show him a food lure.<br>  2. Begin walking in a straight line while your dog follows the lure giving the command "Heel." Keep your left hand always ready to grab your dog's collar if he should become distracted.<br>  3. To teach your dog to stop give him the command "Wait" and while holding the lure in front of his nose kneel beside him. Place your left hand, palm down, under your dog's belly against his back legs to stop him from moving.<br>  4. To get your dog to turn to the right simply bend your knees and move your hand with the lure in it as you turn saying, "Heel." Your dog will have to walk at a faster pace to keep up with the promised treat. Make sure to treat your dog when he follows your commands and actions.<br>  5. To get your dog to turn to the left put the lure in your right hand and while guiding your dog by his collar with your left hand move the lure around to the left. Your dog should follow it.<br>  <br>  Rewards, rewards, rewards - once your dog learns you can cut the treats out some so he learns on command...|`|3zv2bbolaa	You begin by teaching an on lead heel command and after the dog has mastered that, you can work towards off lead heeling. Enrolling in obedience classes will better enable you to work with your dog in teaching these basic obedience skill sets.|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	patience and practice.|`|KsQ2EftYaa	Enroll your dog in a group dog training class.

(Choking is cruelty)|`|KxdDeO8Taa	hav him specially trained|`|1854fb53779c38ad23e299fcc95f6010aa	Start in the back yard , use the word heel ( or any word as long as your are consistent. Start with a treat each time he does it and stop and put him back with a treat each time you need too. After he does it well with treats you can start backing off on the treats until your not giving anymore , use cooked pieces of chicken. Just a thought.<br>  <br>  Good luck , it will take patience on your end and continuity as well.

CdRlOsnyaa	that is seen alot when a heavy force is applied to a certain part of the tail. liek a cats tail being slammedi n the door it will break cartlidge and bend. im guessing the previous owner steipped in its tail by mistake ( hopefully) and the tail muscle was buckled causing a bend. there is nothign a vet can do to help that and the ferret will be perfectly fine. good luck adn thank you for rescuing that animal|`|DAtqr0QHaa	I have a cat like that.

2CbfO4jWaa	mice are a COMPLETE food item chicken parts are not. whole mice have the benefit of providing many minerals via their skeletal structure most notably calcium , the liver provides d3 as well as iron, the fur acts a roughage keeping everything running smooth and of course all the other organs and such provide many other nutrients to the animal being fed(not to mention the VERY nutritious gut contents of the prey item hhhhmmmmm yum!). store bought chicken or beef pretty much only provide protein and some calcium if there is bone involved.  they are very nutritionally INCOMPLETE and besides most snake wont recognize them as food (well some will definitely take the chicken like pythons and such it still doesn't mean they should.)<br>  <br>  p.s. this was NOT a silly question. a good one actually.|`|AA10805458	Meats from the grocery store like chicken, are only the muscle part of the animal.  Feeding mice and rats to snakes gives them a more nutritionally complete diet because they have bones, nerves, their own intestinal contents to give snakes vitamins and minerals that they need as well.|`|2qgg2G8kaa	I have 5 snakes and I feed them f/t and one of them eats a live pinkie rat. Snakes prefer rodents and small animals depending on the size. Snakes are not interested in something that has to be cooked. F/t mice/rats are frozen and thawed out in warm water but not cooked. Snakes don't have a diet on beef, ham, chicken, and turkey which obviously includes chicken, turkeys, cows, and pig. Large snakes prefer rabbits, chickens (the type that are alive and not sold at stores), and other small animals they can fit their mouth around. In the wild, most large snakes have a diet on animals like crocodiles, other snakes, small animals to medium sized animals, and things such as that.|`|UZYT8eMwaa	This is an Excellent question.<br>  VARANID pretty much nailed it. <br>  Many snakes eat a wide verity of prey animals in the wild,but not all snakes eat rodents. Mice and rats are easily commercial available, you can get feeder chicks, quail, rabbits, and even pigs. For large constrictors you could feed them "regular meat"( if they will take it), you would just have to use a vitamin/mineral supplement.|`|ogtvxoMAaa	They are genetically trained to eat whole. Their minds tell them food means something that have a head (which should be consumed first), and a body and the rest. Without properly training them, giving them a piece of chicken (or other meat) will confuse them as they don't know where to start.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	snakes get all the nurishment they need from mice/rats
o93EwErKaa	Good job in changing to a higher quality food.  If he is picking it out than there is not much you can do.  You could measure out the correct amount with 1/4 new and 3/4 old and "force" him to eat the remainder by not giving him anything else.  If in 3 days you don't notice soft stools, go 1/2 and 1/2 wait for three days, check stools, then go 3/4 and 1/4, etc.<br>  <br>  Most likely, he will just have diarrhea for a couple of days which can be helped by giving him a heaping teaspoon of plain canned pumpkin three times a day until it clears up.|`|GLsCVPCuaa	great job changing the food...your dog is thanking you|`|8xBlKPPWaa	yes, if hes picking it out git rid of the science diet. the dog will let ya know. but typical answer would be yes mix the food. hope it helped.|`|GaL66jbQaa	he'll be fine he might get the runs for a couple days but maybe not.  it's more of a problem when you're switching between lower quality foods that have lots of fillers|`|TYjXGyCzaa	Yea this mean he is comfortable with this food and isn't bothered  by change.|`|g36NU81raa	Well, if you really have tried, seeing as he's already started on it anyway, I'm sure it will be fine.|`|Y0U3ZXYCaa	Well, I think you should tell a doctor about changing your dogs diet

Its bets to see a vet for this, trust me you'd rather them express them than try and do it yourself. <br>  <br>  The other reason is they have worms or just an itchy bum. Either way its best to see a vet and find out what is going on. Bring them a fecal (poop) sample as well.|`|AAZ3sNCgaa	It is because they're anal glands are not expressing normally, so they get full and irritating.

wEiHz1Llaa	When he is "Grinding His Peak" - he is in a state of Relaxation, and trying 2 calm himself down- so he can sleep.<br>  <br>  As far as Catching him- I would ring his bells in his cage- this will get his attention- they just love bells, Put the tv on a channnel that has one of those "nature channels" that has Birds Singing on it, this will comfort him, then he will come back to the cage himself. <br>  <br>  Chasing him is a "BAD-IDEA"--they do NOT 4 get, especially if he is new. He sounds "Insecure" if he is Biting" - and Terribly AFRAID- I would Load Up his cage with Many Toys, and a few Mirrors on Different Levels, one in front of each perch. <br>  <br>  If he does Not "Stop" the biting in about a week- I would recommend "another Cockatiel, as he would feel more Content.<br>  <br>  Also - when he Bites- say "NO" in a FIRM voice- and put him back in his cage for a few minutes, then take him out again. If he bites again- Just say "NO" , no other words, and put him back in his cage. He does understand this-- but is "AFRAID" of you, so do this til you "Gain His Trust" !! <br>  I hope this Help's you. <br>  We leave our TV on "All-Day" for our 6-Cockatiels and they just Love it- they watch tv, and we leave Cartoon's on 4 them. Other day's it's the Jazz station, then it can be Nature Music" and even Koda Dances to the music,and bop's his head. It is so Cute and worth it. Just "Don't Give Up !!|`|Gr6Xe1gGaa	True had a good idea or just try putting the cage near him so he can get in and then just close it.|`|BCZ1ezXMaa	when he sits on something by a wall, get a shirt or towel and cover his front. gently wrap it around him so he can breathe, but you can hold him. bring him to his cage and when your arms are in there, release grip of your bird and then shut the cage.<br>  <br>  EDIT  trust me i have a cockatiel. they are all pretty moody. he will get over it.<br>  its better than using your hands. my cockatiel made my hands bleed with like 6 bites<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: im not sure on the noise, but i think all, or most, birds do it|`|uvHc7EDOaa	Just give him a chance to calm down. The noise is either 'keep away' or hes regurgitating. All birds do this. Some grind their beaks when they do it, some don't. Mine does. Does he have his wing clipped? If not, catch him in a towel again and get him in a box. A vet can clip his wing for you. This way the next time he gets out, he can't bash against walls or windows. Instead he'll just glide down. Don't let this stop you from letting him out again, the more you let him out, the better he'll learn to fly, especially once hes learned the shape of the room. Plus he'll like you more. Hopefully he'll eventually put himself back, like mine.<br>  :)

It may even have come from Turkey, the land of the Turkish Toy Greyhound, another species of naked canine.<br>  <br>  The little naked Mexican Hairless was considered as a gift from the gods by the Aztecs, because when someone was sick, the dog could warm the patient with its naked body.<br>  <br>  The earliest inhabitants of Mexico, the Toltecs, had kept the blue Chihuahua in their temples for religious purposes. When the Aztecs conquered the Toltecs, dogs of both breeds were kept in luxury inside the temples. <br>  <br>  It is possible that the inevitable inter-breeding of the Mexican Hairless with the Chihuahua may have produced the Chinese Crested breed we know today?<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/xoloitzcuintle.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/xoloitzcuint...</a><br>  <br>  Chinese Crested:<br>  Think to be linked to China since the thirteenth century, the Chinese Crested Dog is believed to have evolved from the African hairless dog. Traded among merchants and sailors, the dogs made their way around ports all over the ancient world. <br>  <br>  The Chinese favored a smaller dog and so selectively bred the African dog to a smaller size, and continued actively trading. As early as the 1500s, explorers found these dogs in Central and South American ports as well as throughout Asia and African cities. In the eighteenth century, European travelers took notice of hairless dogs in Chinese port cities and as the pets of Chinese sailors working on trade ships in and out of Africa. Paintings of the breed began to reach Europe in the 1800s and the Chinese Crested is depicted repeatedly in nineteenth century European art and architecture.<br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/chinesecrested.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/chinesecrest...</a><br>  <br>  The difference between the 2;  the Mexican hairless is completely hairless where the Chinese Crested has hair on their head/face, lower legs and tail...|`|tPGxPDvBaa	They are two completely different breeds.<br>  <br>  Chinese crested come in 2 varieties - powder puff which is full coated or the hairless which does have some hair - feet, tail & head but only 1 size for either one.<br>  <br>  The mexican hairless comes in 3 sizes & is not actually completely hairless as most ppl believe.  They have very thick skin & small tufts of hair on their head, feet & tail.   I know vets who say they have to take a running start to get a needle thru the skin when they get their yearly shots cuz their skin is so thick & tough. They are more similar to elephant skin in appearance & feel. There are a few coated ones also but not as common & more undesirable.|`|Bw18seFqaa	They are not the same thing..<br>  <br>  the "mexican hairless" is also known as the Xoloitzcuintle<br>  <br>  The Chinese Crested is a different breed.<br>  <br>  The Xolo comes in 3 sizes, and is pretty much hairless... there is a coated version which has a short, smooth coat<br>  <br>  The Crested comes in one recognized size, it has long, silky, hair on the Head, feet and tail.

6uFaP2OAaa	Family tree doesn't help; you have to look at the parents origin.<br>  Your horse is 100% Hanovarian; the stallion is 50% Mustang and 50% Arabian.  You'll end up with a foal that is 50% Hano, 25% Mustang and 25% Arabian.  It will probably be called a Hano and look like a Hano, but it's just a cross breed.<br>  Try breeding with a pure mustang; then your chance is at least 50/50, even though it won't be a pure bred.|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	i THINK 50/50.. not sure.
scdOdaTKaa	She will grow out of it, this is common in all puppies and usually the as they get bigger the less this will happen.  When you get home try to be calm this will help her to be calm, when company is coming over, try to greet them outside with her so that she pees outside.  As for getting the leashes, can you pick her up and then get the leashes and carry her out.  These are just somethings I would try other than that it just requires patience.  odoban is a cleaning agent that is AWESOME at getting out the urine smell. Good luck|`|JsBb732Maa	Get a slip on collar/leash and you can put it on her quick enough she shouldn't notice it before you can get her out.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	This is a common puppy faze.. She will eventually stop. Maybe you should take her out more often as well so you won't have this problem.|`|24CFl7sjaa	this is excitement or submissive peeing, she is only a little thing so she probably hasn't developed the muscle tone yet to 'hold it' if she gets over excited. It should improve as she gets older and having her lead on or your return is less of an event for her. You could also check with the vet as some small dogs do have slight urinary incontinence which can be sorted out. All I can suggest for now is keep the leads in an area that is uncarpeted so the messes are easier to clean up, when you return from anywhere let her straight outside without speaking to her then say hello and pet her. Hopefully she will grow out of it.|`|GSf09ALBaa	This is easier than you think.  First of all she is still very young.  4.5 months is a baby.  So, the excited peeing is not unusual especially if she is a small breed.  The best way to handle this is to ignore her.<br>  <br>  Okay, easier said than done, right?  Okay, first let's tackle the leash thing.  When you go to get the leashes you do not want a state of excitment.  (ya, I know).  So, get your leashes and make both dogs go into a sit position.  I am seeing the little one in my mind running and peeing all over the place.  This is when you DO NOT acknowledge the peeing (just chill it for a few minutes)  and say sit.  You want them to be as calm as you can get them before leashing them up.  If you need to and have a fenced in area, take them outside for this until she gets it under control.  Don't put that leash on until they have calmed. You also must stay calm.  The less talk the better.  If they don't, ignore, replace the leashes and go sit down.<br>  <br>  When you come home you do not acknowledge.  No eye contact, no talk, no touch.  When you pet her you are feeding her excitment which leads to the peeing.  Wait until she completely settles down, then pet her.  Inform all of your friends to react the exact same way.  My friends know when they come to my house they do not acknowledge any of my dogs until everyone has settled.  <br>  <br>  You get into a habit of ignoring until settled, she will stop the peeing and as she gets older it will become easier.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|MYEEK4dcaa	This is called submissive urination.  It's caused because the dog isn't sure yet that it is pleasing you, and is scared that it isn't.  Even when she's excited, she's not sure she's pleasing you.<br>  <br>  To help prevent it, keep a collar on her in the house while you're home and can watch her to make sure the leash doesn't get caught on anything.  Then you'll be further away from her when you pick up the leash, and she might not get so scared.<br>  <br>  Also, there are enzymatic cleansers such as Urine Gone, which used to (and may still) come with a black light so you can see where the stain is.  If she's accustomed to going in the same spot on a carpet, you may not be able to get the scent out of the padding under the actual carpet.<br>  <br>  Finally, you have to act like a leader.  If you make up rules for her, such as no getting on the furniture or stay out of the kitchen while mom is cooking, and stuff like that; if you exercise her regularly until she's reasonably tired; and if you give her daily obedience drills to build her confidence, she's more likely to stop.  Take her to puppy school or to obedience classes - and take your Urine Gone with you - because that will also boost her confidence.<br>  <br>  Remember - she's totally dependent upon you.  Lead her gently, and she should recover.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|7n523JW1aa	That's definitely a puppy thing. My Boerboel did this from 4-13 months. They just get so overly excited because they are getting exercise. She'll grow out of this. Just make sure to clean up those areas with pee up really well. =)). Hope I helpd.|`|bPeK2jaQaa	You need to take her/him out every 2-3 hours hope you know, and i think he/she related leash to peeing and that's why.|`|bP4MOHWOaa	You have to admit, it's somewhat funny-cute that she pees at happiness.<br>  <br>  Umm...just put pads underneath her before you get her?|`|7Nzvjkbsaa	Hehe!  I can totally relate--my 5 1/2 year-old cockapoo does that too, as did my parents' 16 year-old cocker spaniel until the day she died.  The 'squirting' is a sign of submission.  Some breeds grow out of it--others (like our Rusti and Oreo) never do.  It is not something that should be corrected as it is an involuntary action and not able to be controlled by the pooch.  My only suggestion is to do what we do--keep paper towels and Windex handy to clean up the puddles!
MGihRO3baa	Humping is not only a sexual thing, but it's also a way to claim dominance, which is probably what she is doing.|`|3d9rSmc1aa	it is not horny, it is dominance in this case. the older dog is simply reminding the younger that it is the dominant one. it seems weird but is natural.|`|ecjImz3Daa	yes it is normal some dogs will still hump anything and everything it does keep some dogs from humping when you get them fix.and other dogs it dont help at all but yes it is normal so dont worry abouth a thing.|`|Kt0qVNZOaa	Lol. I heard the same thing from people at the local dog park. They told me that their dogs -- male and female, hump ever since they got neutered.  I think it's an imbalance of hormones after the neuter. It's weird but your dog is not the only dog that does this after neuter. Lol. Strange.|`|34uWa9kHaa	The dog is not horny.  Humping is not always sexual.   <br>  This is a display of dominance.  And you need to correct it when it is happening.   Your older dog is trying to dominate the younger.
va8xvhthaa	You shouldn't go to Petco nor PetSmart (www.petsmartcruelty.com). Even though this website is about PetSmart's cruelties, Petco gets their rodents from the same places as PetSmart does.

Lots of people are ill-informed about how to care for ferrets, the expense involved(after you've paid the initial price) and the attention they demand. They're one of those creatures that don't do well without a buddy. They are also unprepared for the length of time these critters live.<br>  So, before you check rescue centers, make sure you're well informed too. Otherwise, that animal is better off without you in the first place.

It's actually pretty drying, especially the cheaper johnson kind all there is a milder sulfate. <br>  <br>  If you use special ph balanced shampoo like from a salon, then it won't be very damaging at all. But most shampoos at drugstores are just pure crap full of SULFATE and people shouldn't even be using them. It's just chemicals.

51St5GEcaa	most breeds were bred for work. There are hunters, herders, drafters, and the like. You shouldn't get a pure bred dog. It would be a serious waste of money if all you want is a pet. And if you want a dog for any other reason than that, then you shouldn't be getting one. <br>  <br>  Go to the humane society or other local pet shelter and rescue one!|`|aCqSF87Raa	Research, research, and research! Sit down with everyone in the household and talk about what you ALL want in a dog. If it makes it easier, write things down: everyone should feel comfortable shouting out their wants.<br>  <br>  Then go through the lists and make a general list about YOUR ideal dog. Include:<br>  <br>  Coat type: long, short, wiry, soft, smooth, shedding, hair/fur.<br>  Grooming needs: Daily, weekly, frequent/occasional professional trips.<br>  Energy level: high indoors, low indoors.<br>  Exercise needs: daily walks, daily runs, every other day walks.<br>  Trainability: easy to train and eager to learn or more stubborn.<br>  <br>  Try to compromise as much as possible so EVERYONE is happy. Then go to the AKC main page and browse through every breed. Or if you know what you don't want, browse by group: most groups are by what the dog does so if you want lower energy levels you could rule out the herding or working group since BOTH need frequent exercise.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.akc.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.akc.org/</a><br>  <br>  I prefer research (books) to breed selectors, but if you want to try them don't forget to research the breeds they pop out THOROUGHLY.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Quizzes are for entertainment only.  <br>  <br>  What I find works best is I sit down and watch an unedited dog show.

Then, I take the ones that I find interesting and do a google search for "(Breed Name) club america" and I read all that I can on the national breed club page. Then, I visit breeder webpages and learn more about the breed.|`|MYEEK4dcaa	Your best bet may not be a purebred dog.  If you check at a shelter or all-breed rescue group, you can find many dogs that will be to your liking.  The most important thing is not the breed or the dog's looks, but the dog's energy.  If you are a high-energy person, get a high-energy dog.  If you are a medium-energy person, get a medium-energy dog.  And, if you are a low-energy person, get a low-energy dog.  This is important, because if you get a dog whose energy is higher than yours, he will soon become a problem because you won't keep up with all the exercise and mental stimulation he needs.<br>  <br>  Another consideration is size.  Consider the size of your living quarters and the size of your fenced back  yard.  The larger both of them are, the larger the dog you'll have space for.  But don't get a German Shepherd if you live in a little apartment!  <grin><br>  <br>  And the final consideration is gender, although that really isn't very important, since shelters and rescues either neuter/spay the dog before it can be adopted or they require that you do it within a certain amount of time - and some will even refund part of the adoption fee if you bring them proof that the dog has been spayed or neutered. <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Apacapacas|`|AA10805458	This tool will help you pick a breed.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.selectsmart.com/DOG/" rel="nofollow">http://www.selectsmart.com/DOG/</a>|`|7n523JW1aa	Here you go.

Kale, Collard Greens, Bok Choy (Pok Choy) occasionally. Green beans, sweet peas, winter squash, sweet potato, lima beans, lentils and some bird seed. Some fruits are okay. Bluberries (best) other berries, apples (lots of sugar) avoid bananas (lots of phosphorous). Some say that the Uromastyx need to eat insect protein once a week. I do not feed this to mine. If I put insects in, my Uromastyx will not eat anything. Mine is young too.

uKOYK1Lvaa	You *do* know that standard Pomeranians are *very* *very* tiny?? And that anything smaller is--quite literally--a ferret or a rat? (no insult to the breed, just a size comparison).<br>  <br>  And you *are* aware that badly bred "teacup" dogs are NOT cheap to purchase, NOR to care for. They cost THOUSANDS for vet bills, and die at a young age.|`|PM23RDycaa	The current version of the Pom is the LITTLE version. The ORIGINAL pom weighed around 30lbs<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a teacup ANYTHING! Reputable breeder do not use those stupid titles. Only bybs and puppymills do.<br>  <br>  Breed standard<br>  Size, Proportion, Substance<br>  The average weight of the Pomeranian is from 3 to 7 pounds, with the ideal weight for the show specimen being 4 to 6 pounds.<br>  <br>  ADD: I would LOVE to know why you think the above weight range is TOO big a dog for you.|`|rLDf1gGGaa	Let's start out by saying "THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS A "TEACUP" PUPPY".<br>  <br>  With that in mind, let me say this; It seems as though there is a plethora of people who are insistent on buying tiny puppies in the 2 to 4 pound range.  Also commonly referred to as a "Teacup puppy".<br>  <br>  The word "Teacup" has been used to merely describe the size of a puppy, meaning it is very small and will probably be under the standard size which is 4 to 7 pounds for the Toy Group, Yorkshire Terrier breed. We cannot imagine anyone wanting anything smaller than that!  Their bones are VERY fragile and can be broken by jumping off of a coach, falling off of a bed, being stepped on or worse.<br>  <br>  Many breeders, while tacking a whooping price on a puppy, "claim" to breed so called "teacups" as if they were a breed all their own. Don't be fooled! They are NOT a breed of their own.  <br>  <br>  If a breeder says they specialize in "teacups" RUN, RUN, RUN for the hills! Most "TEACUP" puppies are in reality, a premature puppy.<br>  <br>  Most females are bred on the ninth through the fifteenth day of their heat cycles. Eggs can be fertilized for up to 72 hours after any of these breeding's. Therefore, it is possible to have puppies conceived up to a week or so younger than the puppies first conceived in a litter.  However, when the first puppies conceived are mature and ready to be born, labor starts and all the puppies will be born, no matter when they were fertilized.  <br>  <br>  Some of the problems that may be encountered are both genetic and congenital in these tiny babies and the list is a long one.<br>  <br>  The risk of open fontanels (soft spot from the cranial bone not forming), portosystemic shunts (PSS- abnormal vessel that allows blood to bypass the liver. As a result the blood is not cleansed by one of the bodies filters: the liver.), hypoglycemia, cardiac problems, collapsing trachea, luxating patellas, Leggs Calves Perthes disease, seizures, hydroencephaly, blindness and digestive problems can be increased in these tiny babies.<br>  <br>  Problems such as respiratory problems can remain or worsen throughout their lives. These babies frequently are so fragile that they do not live more than a few years. There have been several tiny Yorkies as adults who still had open fontanels and their owners had to carry nourishment with them all the time. Their vets have felt it unsafe to give a full dose of vaccine so the puppies had to get several injections to be on the safe side.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as a "tea cup" Yorkshire Terrier, Maltese, Poodle, or any other breed for that matter.  They simply do not exist. "Tea-cup" is just a marketing ploy given by unethical and unscrupulous breeders to drive up the price of their puppies!<br>  <br>  <br>  So called "Teacups" fetch anything from $1000 to $10,000! This is ridiculous and shameful! There are a lot of chronically, unhealthy puppies because unscrupulous breeders and puppy mills are inbreeding.  Some poor darlings only live for a very, very short time!<br>  <br>  They take the little teeny, tiny Yorkies and they breed 2 1/2 pounders with 3 pounders ... well, they’re playing with genetics. You should NEVER breed a female of any breed less than 5 pounds.<br>  <br>  PLEASE educate yourselves before buying a tiny puppy whether it is a Yorkie or any other breed.

However, like yourself, I am probably out of luck.<br>  <br>  Breeding ethically is not cheap, therefore puppies are not cheap.  Breeders have money invested in their programs that they have to cover by charging for pups.  Expecting to be able to get one for little to nothing is not only unrealistics, it's actually very insulting to breeders.  It's like saying that the dog is not worth what they have invested in them.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, there is no such thing as a "teacup" of any breed.  It's a marketing term used by unethical breeders to decsribe a dog that was bred to be extremely small with little to no regard to the overall health of the animal.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that before you actively try to acquire any dog, you take the time to research and educate yourself on the breed FIRST.  It will help you avoid being scammed and enable you to determine if a dog you are considering has had the proper testing done and if it is a quality representation of the breed.|`|UE4WbmtQaa	there isn't really such a thing as a teacup pomeranian, basically its just a runt or a seiries of runts bred with eachother. also, "teacup" dogs are often too tiny and have severe health problems. dont waist your money on an expensive runt. get a needy pomeranian from a rescue/shelter. <a href="http://www.petfinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com</a>|`|WYwGrcknaa	Once again there is no such thing as a teacuo anything other then the teacup you drink out of.A teacup is a runt, a sick puppy and you should not give your money away to people who breed these poor dogs.A pomeranian is a small breed any smaller and you might mistake it for a fuzzy rat|`|br1Ixdxkaa	teacup pomeranian?<br>  i thought they came in ONE size|`|iembGsl9aa	Hahaha<br>  Teacup basically means your gonna pour a whole ton o money into the dog. <br>  Teacups for some reason tend to be overpriced to being with.<br>  Then since htey were bred so poorly they are often sick, which requires vet care. <br>  Then they die prematurely 'cause they are ill bred runt puppies. <br>  <br>  Get a real pomeranian not an abomination

By neutering a male dog, this will greatly decrease the chance of ur dog getting testicular cancer and prostate issues.  It is recommended to spay your female dog before their first heat cycle, this will greatly prevent them from getting mammary cancer, and by spaying a female it will prevent them from getting a pyometra. A pyometra is an infection in the uterus.  Not a pretty site or smell.

kZ5wWUg2aa	As cats get older they develop all kinds of lumps and bumps its just a part of getting old. Some tumours are sometimes just a lipoma which is a fatty lump under the skin which is usually soft. If he seems a little tender in that leg i would suggest you take him to be seem at a vet. If they are tender we usually do recommend removing them. <br>  <br>  They can check what sort of lump it is by putting a small needle into the lump and sucking out the cells onto a microscope slide. They can then most of the time tell you what sort of lump it is and if it needs to be removed. They sometimes will send it off to the pathology to get more details.<br>  <br>  In the long run, its best to find out what it is now then later.

She is afraid of outdoor, just sit at the front porch with her.  Throw treats around and let her to go take it....<br>  <br>  You need to desensitize the fear.  Because she is a timid dog,  you need to even take her out more often.

Get your puppy a toy or something to keep it occupied if you need to leave. <br>  Those might help.
6PasPfKEaa	Unfortunately, that price range makes it near impossible to find a puppy from a reputable breeder. If you are looking for a German shepherd under $1000... I suggest going to your local animal shelter, German shepherd rescue, or visiting petfinder.com Since you are only looking for a pet - that'd be the perfect place to find one. Any dog could make a fantastic pet. You just have to make sure you know enough to be a good owner.<br>  <br>  The reason you should never buy a $500 pup from a backyard breeder or pet store is because those dogs are VERY illy bred and most likely will come with all sorts of health and temperament problems that will eat away at your wallet and mind later on. Good breeders price their dogs at what they are because of all the money they spend on health testing and titling their dogs, making sure their breeding stock and litters are quality. And even then, they lose money with every litter they have.<br>  <br>  If you really want a dog from a reputable breeder, I would strongly suggest Vom Landholz German shepherds. They are working line dogs, though, so make sure to ask for a low drive and relatively low energy dog, as a high drive dog in a pet home is disasterous. The breeder is a fantastic person, very knowledgeable regarding the breed, and very involved with her dogs. And amazing dogs they are, solid temperaments and fantastic pedigrees. Diesel especially has a pedigree that has me drooling! She's a very helpful person, and right in Florida.<br>  <br>  www.vomlandholz.com<br>  <br>  Website may not be much to look at, but trust me, she is great. All her dogs have a health warranty. But please make sure to do research on the breed beforehand, they are NOT dogs for everyone. GSDs have tons of requirements many cannot meet, resulting in the large number of these beautiful dogs in shelters.<br>  <br>  If you cannot pay the full price outright, talk to the breeder, and I'm sure she will work something out with you. Many breeders I know allow purchasers to pay the initial price of their pup over time, little by little.|`|WHEftie5aa	If you live in central florida, on saturdays and sundays the Save A Life Pet Rescue is hosted outside petsmart where they sell puppies that were in a High Kill shelter in Georgia. All the pupies are very young, and I am sure they will have at least one German Shepherd. If you are interested, google Save A life Pet rescue to get more information. You can also look on Petfinder to see some of the puppies that will be there on different days.|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	Does it have to be a puppy?

The reason you pay more money for is for quality dogs. $1500 is not unreasonable.  Anyone selling below that price should be carefully checked, it would be a red flag for a backyard breeder.  <br>  GSDs are extremely overbred. There are too many people breeding dogs that should not be bred, ie poor temperment, bad hips, genetic issues. You should look for a breeder who certifies the hips, eyes, and elbows of the parents at least. These things cost money which is why you pay more money for the dogs.  BYBs typically don't do these types of tests, allowing them to sell for less, but you chances of running into costly health problems go up.<br>   Even if you don't plan to show or breed your dog, titles are important from the parents. This helps show they have a good temperment. It is also a good indication of a reputable breeder. Simply being a "purebred with papers" or from "champion lines" does not mean the dog should be bred.   GSDs are especially prone to temperment issues.  Any GSD with nerve issues should not be bred.  Chances are that if the parents have been able to achieve titles, they are less likely to have nerve issues.  <br>  Reputable breeders rarely make any money of their litters.  A good breeder will take the dog back at any time in its life.  Most offer contracts with right of first refusal.  They breed with a purpose, whether its herding, working/SAR/Schutzhund. or show. There are plenty of "pet quality" dogs left over in each litter.  There are too many homeless dogs out their to  breed simply for a companion dog alone.  <br>  <a href="http://www.germanshepherds.com/forum/ubb..." rel="nofollow">http://www.germanshepherds.com/forum/ubb...</a> is a great place for information about GSDs. If you post a name of a breeder, people will give you specific feed back about them. There is also a rescue section.<br>  $1500 is alot of money now, but it can mean alot less money in vet bills later on.|`|mkMaSE4yaa	Save a life. Go to a shelter and give a dog  a new chance.|`|0AEi70ywaa	If you're unconcerned with pedigree I would suggest finding a German Shepherd Rescue in your area to adopt from.

You may even find a purebred in a shelter!|`|Bw18seFqaa	www.petfinder.com  patience will pay off.. if you keep looking in shelter and rescue you will find a GSD.<br>  <br>  Any breeder charging that low is not worth going to..  if they are selling cheap, that means they are cutting corners on proper health tests and prenatal care.
L1mGeTmxaa	Hi there!  <br>  <br>  First of all, congratulations on your new baby.  Mastiffs are a wonderful breed to be owned by.  <br>  <br>  In regards to weight, this is tricky.  My mastiffs were around 20 lbs at approximately 7 weeks old.  About 25 lbs when I brought them home at 8 weeks.  That is a pretty normal size for well-bred, typey mastiffs.  My bigger boy was a pretty thin 36 lbs at 11 weeks.<br>  <br>  I would check with your breeder to find out how the other pups are doing weight-wise.  20 lbs at 11 weeks sounds pretty small to me, although not unheard of.  Did you meet his mom & dad?  How big are they.  If they are small mastiffs, then your puppy's weight may be fine.<br>  <br>  Other than small, how does your pup look?  Can you see more than the last two ribs or his hip bones?  If not, then he probably is not underweight.  <br>  <br>  In any case, I would be very careful not to overfeed him.  These pups grow incredibly fast (mine went from 1.5 lbs to over 200 in one year) and eating too much can cause really funky growth spurts that can end up doing permanent orthopedic damage.  <br>  <br>  I have included a few informative links about feeding & raising your mastiff.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your little guy!|`|XZoYjav9aa	all puppies progress differently, but that does sound a little on the lighter side for a mastiff, but he could just be small, Your best option is to call your local vet and see what they think. If they think that seems out of place then take him to the vet and they will be able to tell you for sure if he is on a healthy road to adult hood.|`|3d9rSmc1aa	check with a vet if you are concerned, but i would say this sounds like an ok weight gain. if they grow too fvast the strain on the weak bones of a pup can deform the bones and cause things like hip displasia, slow and steady is best.|`|IdSqunZuaa	Yeah, Mastiffs are really big. Check with your vet about his diet.

He still loves to chase balls though, he just doesnt bring them back to me lol|`|sOkePjK3aa	no but thats so awesome|`|O0lb4Kcnaa	animals can be so entertaining.

Zips all over the house for about 5 minutes at a time, it's funny.|`|sHB9a7P3aa	I used to, she played fetch with a rubber band, a rubber bracelet, and a plastic whiffle ball. =)|`|GYwLGjt2aa	wow cats are smart.. i used to have a cat her name was willow<br>  <br>  i taught her how walk with a leash. so yeah i belive cats can fecth|`|KJDH7ShNaa	no i don't you should tape it and send it to america funniest video.<br>  or put it on the internet.|`|DAtqr0QHaa	I do!<br>  Mine does the same with the tags.<br>  Plus mine pants like a dog. haha She's funny.
Rx7wv4JLaa	Dogs do not have a period they have an estrus cycle or heat cycle. You were half right. <br>  <br>  What to do, keep her away from males intact dogs, I'd also not leaves her unsupervised unless she is alone in the house, you can buy some what look like diapers for her to help stop her from bleeding all over your house. And lastly I'd book an appointment to get her spayed in about a month. A vet won't spay until a dog is out of a heat cycle and a heat cycle can last approx 21 days.|`|bIaywrBCaa	She is in heat, spotting but it is not her period. She is just in heat. Keep her away from any males so she doesn't get pregnant. If you do not want to deal with the blood get some doggy diapers from the pet store. She will be in heat for about 3 weeks so keep her away from the males that long to protect her.|`|scdOdaTKaa	First off learn how to spell the type of dog you have, Chihuahua, second off you should have her spayed.  It is healthier for her and less of a mess to deal with.  Spaying a dog can prevent the occurence of cancer by 85%.   <br>  To deal with it if you are one of those people that refuses to spay them is buying the diapers at the pet stores. Other htan that pay the consequence of cleaning it up.|`|AA11244754	here is a wild idea go to to Petco or PetSmart and get some special panties and pads and KEEP HER AWAY FROM ALL INTACT MALE DOGS (if you don't know what to do and couldn't bother to research dams I figured you wouldn't know that either), then in 3 weeks when her heat is over (as periods only apply to humans, duh) get her spayed!  You would have known what to do if you had tried to do some reseach on how to care for dams, try it, it's all the rage!<br>  <br>  It's little wonder you don't know the terminology, since you can't even spell c-h-i-h-u-a-h-u-a-h-a.|`|JsBb732Maa	She is in heat, dogs don't have periods.

Keep her away from any intact dogs.  Do not let her outside unsupervised male dogs can smell her miles away and will find away to get to her.  <br>  <br>  You can get small dog diapers if she is dripping everywhere at Petsmart, petco whatever petstore is near you.|`|RDcwT7YEaa	Get two pairs of dog panties, be sure to get the proper size for her because you will have to wash one everyday. Use the same pads that you use and change them several times a day or the smell will be bad and blood will get on your floors and furniture. She will be in heat for 21 days maybe longer so it is going to require a lot of time on your part.<br>  <br>  Don't let her out of your site!! You are going to have male dogs at your door because females put off a scent. Dogs will jump fences lay at your door whatever they have to so they can mate, it is their nature. Do not open the door until her leash is on her and when you are taking her out tighten her collar up a notch to make it tighter on her neck because she IS going to pull away from you so she can mate. Don't forget to loosen it up when you get safely back in the house. This is where the old saying "like a ***** in heat" comes from. You must be diligent.<br>  <br>  You will probably never have to go through this again because after the next 21 days you will Beg your Vet to spay her.|`|KJDH7ShNaa	all depend if you have other pets in the house.<br>  first thing first if you have a male dog in the house keep her in a diffent room unless you want her to have puppies.<br>  any for her just put a diaper on her if you like.<br>  plus you can also call your vet ans ask them.<br>  it better to have her fix than to have puppies that you don't want then she won't have her period anymore.<br>  hope i helped i don't care about the points just want to help.give the dog a kiss and a hug for me..|`|6iuqhe4haa	I would get her spayed as soon as she is done with her heat cycle.<br>  But if you don't want to breed her, she is too young or don't want blood everywhere - they make 'diapers' for dogs so none of that will happen.<br>  Though I would not totally rely on these 'diapers' keeping her from not getting pregnant.|`|nBehRANyaa	Call your vet in the morning and make a spay appointment.

Hope I helped.|`|EijzrUn1aa	Keep her away from male dogs, and then when she is out of heat, get her spayed.|`|AAZ3sNCgaa	Dogs don't get periods, even though that is what it looks like.  During their heat cycle, they are able to get pregnant.  If you don't want her to get pregnant, you need to keep her away from intact male dogs.  Her heat cycle will last for 3 weeks, while the bleeding portion only lasts for 1 week.|`|ecjImz3Daa	well if you got a male dog then i would put her up in another room are watch her really close.and if she goes out to the bath room make sure she uses the bath room and get her back in as soon as you can.becouse if you dont the other dogs around the nebeirhood will smell her and come after her fast.|`|3f6tFiLGaa	First off don't listen to those rude people I mean it is good to spay them but its your choice NOT THEIRS!!! and you can get her little panties or diapers from a lot of stores. And after she is out of heat then if you want you could get her spayed but for now just get some diapers and keep her away from male dogs.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope I helped:)|`|3d9rSmc1aa	there is nothing to do except keep her away from other dogs as much as possible until she 'finishes'. <br>  as for the mess, it's just one of those things but you can get panties and pads from pet supply stores to help with that if you feel you want it. <br>  hope this helps.|`|nPud1QJjaa	Puppy pants or old panties and a pad will do.

GaSK15Kpaa	Your hamster is fine :)<br>  Just put a heaped teaspoonful of hamster food a day onto the floor or in a bowl. Both are fine.<br>  Hamsters are like humans - they feel a bit hungry now, bit full later on and then hungry again. Its perfectly normal for them not to eat and then eat more later. And you never know he might be eating while your asleep. My hammy always leaves the black sticks in his bowl because he hates them lol. So your hammy will probs have preferences to his food aswell. This is also normal.<br>  You dont change the food - just pick up any tht he has left in bowl or floor and put fresh down - do NOT take food from his nest where he keeps it.. the only time you should clear that away is when you clean the cage.<br>  Also if you give your hammy any foods that rot ie. cheese, meat, vegetables, fruit make sure you clear it up at the end of the day so he doesnt get food poisoning.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Lucinda|`|AA11902187	Go here: <a href="http://hamsterharbor.co.nr/" rel="nofollow">http://hamsterharbor.co.nr/</a><br>  <br>  And click "Feeding" on the links side.|`|a3oW2Syvaa	My mom always says, "Feed it a little every day" because if you like leave a bunch of food in the bowl, the hammie might knock over the food. that happened to me only 1 time.|`|yN8s1qevaa	Teaspoon and a half a day.

RwXTJiTMaa	its not good to get them wet, especially because they can get sick if there's a cold draft. <br>  <br>  you should probably look for a better water-feeder, the cheaper ones will always drip. most hamsters wont sit beneath it to the point where they will get very wet, but if you're worried -- I'd go spend a few extra bucks on a better water bottle. A bigger bottle might leak less -- the one I use for my rabbit is pretty large but it never drips.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|cx3vPnojaa	Well i know that you are not supposed to wet rabbits but you should be ok with them getting wet as long as you are not putting them IN water.|`|AA11562326	A few drops of water won't hurt him, and the hamster knows not to stand under the drip.<br>  <br>  However, you should probably get that water bottle replaced.

AA11121172	Well, first thing to do is a trip to the vet to rule out any thing health wise.  The new litter is recyled newspaper right?  I wonder if she has an allergy to the ink that is used in it, and its making her itchy, which causes her to lick a lot.  If the vet finds nothing, try switching back to her old litte.<br>  <br>  Also, a new move could trigger over-grooming from stress.  Cats often times get stuck in a cyle because they over groom, the spot feel funny, so they lick it, causing more over grooming, etc.  If its getting very serious (red, infected), getting a cone (e-collar) and having your cat where it for a few weeks might be enough to break the pattern.|`|NGmRMqe6aa	yes, she can have an allergy to the fragrance they use. Change back and see if the hair grows back.|`|kZ5wWUg2aa	Sounds like she could still be a little stressed with the house move. Cats are very sensitive when it comes to a change of environment. You can get a spray called feliway from your vet. This spray is a friendly cat pheromone which makes your cat feel safe. It works well as i have used it many times.<br>  The hair loss sounds like it could be a result of overgrooming.
IMPvzBk1aa	Most likely, your other horses have already had them and are immune.  However, if they haven't had them they can be susceptible to the virus.  It runs its course, and most vets will tell you just to leave them alone as that happens.  Most treatments people use to get rid of them risk leaving scars or pigment spots that can be permanent.  Even vet treatments like freezing them can have the same result.  They will be gone, on their own, if you do nothing, which is what I would do.|`|5QG9Zrjaaa	Warts are communicable, and any horse on the place can get them if they haven't already had them.  My 20 year old gelding got them when he went to live with a donkey who had them.  They are ugly, but harmless.  One way to start them going away a little faster is to take a pair of pliers or tweezers and pinch 2 or 3 of the warts until they bleed.  They'll go away in about 6-7 weeks if you pinch them, and in about 8 weeks if you don't.  =)  By pinching them, your filly's body will make more antibodies faster to kill the virus that causes them.<br>  <br>  This is a contact contagion, so if you can keep your horses separated and off the same pasture/paddock for the next couple of months, you can avoid spreading it, but it really isn't more than a cosmetic issue, and keeping everybody separated may be more traumatic than than the virus.<br>  <br>  Your horses will be fine.
EZW8m4FZaa	I finished those while back, english. (the new levels)<br>     What was required level 1. was a stable, written and ridden exam. <br>  You were to preform walk/trot and 2 point.  <br>   & in the stable you were to go in halter a horse, groom & tack up. <br>   You must know the brushes ect, for the written as well as saddle & Bridle parts.   <br>  <br>     For level 2. The ridden consists of a walk/trot/canter warm up. Were your asked to sit the trot, post, and circle on a canter. And then to trot through a pole course (not jump)<br>  Stable  managment was Tacking up a horse and walking them around. <br>    And written was horse colors, markings and parts. <br>   Hope that helps.|`|QuVvKDq6aa	Er... Western or English?   <br>  <br>  The best info you can get on them is by contacting your provincial equestrian federation.  For example, in Ontario this would be the OEF, Saskatchewan the SHF, Alberta is the AEF.  Ontario seems to be the best organized, they even have upcoming test dates on their website.  But call whichever of these offices applies to you and there will be a real live person you can ask for more information. They can send you the materials and a list of people who can evaluate the various levels.  In the less-populated provinces, like Saskatchewan, you may need to set up your own evaluations, as there aren't many who can do it so the program hasn't really caught on as well as it has in places like Ontario.<br>  <br>  For English Rider Levels 1 and 2 you can use you own instructor if you take lessons with someone who is able to test the levels.  For Levels 5+ (English) and I think all the Western ones, you have to test with someone other than your usual instructor.  But I might be wrong on that, so check.<br>  <br>  I don't have any personal experience with them myself.  I have the materials and talked about doing it, but haven't yet.  I know people who are working on doing it more seriously, some because they want to be instructors, but that's about it.<br>  <br>  I know that the rider level 4+ in english can be done with or without jumps.  I also know there's a theoretical and a practical (ride) component to each level.  The books have been updated and are better, but not great.  The ride at level 4 at least consists of quite a bit of stirrup-less work.  That's about all I know.
bPdqwkpPaa	If the vet thinks it's ok, then that should make you feel better.  If you still feel that it's something more serious, then you should get a second opinion. <br>  <br>  If you used a responsible breeder, one who shows her dogs, then you should contact them about it.  They would know how normal it is for their dogs. <br>  <br>  You also need to be careful about allowing your pup to eat and drink so quickly.  Boxers are one of those breeds that's very very prone to bloat.  Your breeder should have explained to you how dangerous it is and spent time going over it with you to make sure your pup doesn't get it.<br>  <br>  For more info on Bloat: <a href="http://www.weimrescue.com/newversion/Bloat.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.weimrescue.com/newversion/Blo...</a>|`|AtLdnZd5aa	suck to be you that sounds bad|`|7n523JW1aa	Typically puppies throw up when they eat to much food.

H7meHFS3aa	Well I'm guessing the reason the first one died is because it landed on it's head. If this one didn't, it will likely survive. If it did, then I'm guessing it will die. If you notice any changes in the way it moves, or if it is refusing to eat, you may want to take it to your local vet to check for broken bones or brain damage.|`|yJjkelGoaa	I'm sorry to say this but he will probably die. One, because he was dropped from a higher area. Two, baby formula is good for humans, but will not sustain him for very long, different animals have different needs and their lives are very fragile during a young age. Even though you may have taken these mice in out of the goodness of your heart, this unfortunately will not be enough to keep him alive. Sorry|`|TND51lVOaa	It probably will die only because if the first one died and you dropped this one but from a higher height then you will probably lose it... sorry.|`|n7w6cOISaa	Wow... you drop one mouse it dies... so your not careful with the other? how smart|`|7NPkmH00aa	Doubt they'd live for any reason.

Make it according to the directions and use a pet nurser to feed it. It will eat about every two hours. and then you will need to take a warm wet rag and rub it's little butt. It will not be able to eliminate on it's own and you will also so need to burp it just like a human baby. A little baby does not eat much so five american dollars will buy a weeks worth of milk and then some. If you can afford they can express mail it and you will have the milk faster. The two hour feedings are a matter of body weight. So the faster he grows the longer between feedings and the ability for it to sleep all night. If formula is not available try warm raw goat's milk or even raw cow's milk. It is the pasteurization that makes it hard for cats to digest..  I will pray for you and your little one.

8q82dLS8aa	Take her to your local animal shelter<br>  <br>  Don't kill her EVER!<br>  <br>  How would you like it if someone said, "hey, I don't like this guy. Guess I'l kill him!"|`|oDVx7nSxaa	If she's got this many issues, most no-kill shelters won't accept her.  Seriously, think about it.  How many people walk into a shelter and say "I want a cat who pees and poops everywhere, and as an added bonus vomits on the cheap food I'll feed her".  If you turn her in to a shelter, they'll adopt her out - maybe - and then when she exhibits these behaviors she may be just tossed outside, unwanted, or beaten for her issues.  Is this the fate you want for her?  You declawed her - and the refusal to use the litter box is what happens in many, many cases.  She's got no chance at all of finding a good home at a shelter, no-kill or otherwise.  She could be warehoused in a kennel cage for the rest of her life, or until that cage space is needed.  Spare her the fear and suffering of being abandoned to the shelter, and if you don't want her for the problems you caused, do the right thing and take her to the vet to be euthanized.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	Consult the Vet and the SPCA if there is no health issues she may be able to be adopted though the SPCA. <br>  <br>  I know everyone will give me thumbs down for this but if the vet re-examines her and tells you that the chances of adoption are very slim it may be more humane to euthanize her. <br>  <br>  a 7 year old cat can be rehomed successfully  but if the animal has any health issues or behaviour issues that may make rehoming difficult or impossible they will be euthanized by the shelter. <br>  I'm surprised that the vet said nothing was wrong with it. Cats are clean animals and if they are vomiting and defecating and urinating on the floors that's usually an indicator that something is wrong. <br>  Call your vet and ask about Shelters and SPCA options.|`|L1EccMeZaa	Look for a no-kill animal shelter, or try to find a home for her yourself. <br>  <br>  I doubt you could have a cat put down for behaviour problems, unless it was really violent like putting someone in the hospital! Putting an animal to sleep is meant to be a last resort for an animal that is in terrible pain and terminally ill, not because they're driving their owner nuts with their behaviour! If a vet would be willing to do it for that reason, then they would be a really horrible vet!

I don't know what the odds are of someone adopting her, but you never know. Cats are so plentiful, if you just leave tuna on your doorstep, you'll soon have one. But the advantage of having a healthy cat, one that has been taken care of like yours, is attractive to some. <br>  <br>  You can often put a "free" ad in the paper for free (depends on where you live) but you will probably get the same response from posting a used single shoe. You may have nothing to lose by trying though. As far as no-kill shelters go, they do have standards, they don't want pets that no one wants, and if your pet has behavior problems, they may reject her. They will find out about the problems if they let her live with a foster family, which is how some of these places must operate, farming out the animals to households, both to see how they fare and to cut back on expenses. Also it's obviously nicer for the pet to live with a family, even temporarily, than in a cage at a shelter. Your best bet is to just find a shelter. She will likely not get adopted out.<br>  <br>  I suppose as a last resort, you could get her a "shed" type building in your backyard and let her live there, give her food and water and just let her do her thing, give her some cozy stuff when it gets cold but make sure she can't get out since she's declawed.

mw3woRpwaa	Its best for puppies to stay with mom a minimum of 8 weeks and preferably 10-12 weeks. Legally in most states you cannot take a puppy away from its mother for 8-10 weeks depending on the state. You can never sell/purchase a puppy younger or you can be fined according to state laws. If a mother dies and the puppies are 4 weeks, the breeder still cannot sell the puppy until its reached the legal age.|`|bIaywrBCaa	they should stay with mom for 8-10 weeks, not 4.|`|p3vjvzRPaa	As others have said, most pups are kept with their moms until 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  The reason is that as the young pup grows they are learning a lot of critical skills from their mother and/or littermates.  Those skills lay the foundation for the pup to know how to interact with other dogs and people down the track.  Basically, if the pups don't learn how to 'play nice' from their mom, they have trouble ever learning it.<br>  <br>  The separation from the mom is also a big stress, and pups are more vulnerable to being traumatized by that at some ages.  It's like forcing someone to do something that really frightens them at a time when they are really not going to cope with it.<br>  <br>  While most good breeders agree that it is bad to take pups too young, there is some debate about what the idea age is.  Ideas vary from 7- 12 weeks.  This is because pups go through a fear period around 8 weeks.  My personal view is to aim for 8 weeks pretty much exactly or during the week before, and the feedback I get (from vets and new owners) is that my pups are more confident and well adjusted than other pups - will be due to others things too of course, but it's enough for me to keep aiming for 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  The websites I give below tell you about the stages of development a pup goes through.|`|p7swtBYzaa	Puppies should stay with their moms and litter  mates at least 8 weeks, preferably 12 - that's where they get their immunity initially and where they learn manners and social skills.<br>  Only really cruddy byb and puppy millers take pups away too early, it is very detrimental to the pup's health, physical and emotional to be taken away from its mother too soon.|`|70878cc978ee2e4a79b3b53284340f9caa	They should stay with their mothers for at LEAST 6 weeks,and 8 weeks is better,as they will be fully weaned and should have had one set of shots and been wormed several times as well. The mother should be fed puppy food for the entire time that she is nursing the pups and then you should get her spayed in 2 months.|`|JM4Uiunqaa	yeah, and then another 4 weeks.

Hope this helps|`|b50Oz78caa	are you using a litter scooper?  i don't know how much easier it can get.  unless you are talking about getting out the pee.<br>  <br>  now, if you are using clumping litter, you'll have a problem with the sifter..  you really need to scrape it off the bottom - i use a wide putty or spackling knife.<br>  <br>  if you are using regular litter, the pee is hard to get out without it mixing in with the clean stuff.  I'm real cheap with the litter, so I just tilt the box slightly after picking out the poop, then scrape out the soggy peed on litter with a 6" spackling kife.<br>  <br>  the other approach is to just very thinly coat the bottom of the litter box with litter.  then just dump and scrape the entire box contents into the trash.<br>  it helps having two boxes - then you can soak one and have it washed out and ready for the next time.<br>  <br>  i would think you could use a litter maid for two cats.<br>  i've never had one.  i've always felt that if you can't take out a few minutes aday to scoop out the litter box, why have a cat?  you have to clean out the litter maid, don't you?

Use a tiny little cup of some sort/plastic poke some holes in it and line with tissue then secure it in between branches of a bush or a tree. The parent bird will recognize its cries and the chick will the parents calls. It does matter that you touched it birds have poor sense of smell. Watch hidden to see what happens. The parent will not come around if you are close. If this fails call the DEC or a local vet and they will give you information on where to call a wildlife rehabber in your area. You will have to take or they may come pick it up. Free for all wildlife. These birds are extremely hard to care for at this age. Keep it warm. Good luck and hats off for caring for it.
AAZ3sNCgaa	I have a cat that does the same thing when he sees birds.  I have another cat that does this when I'm filling their food bowls.  Cats will chatter or "chirp" when they're excited.  It is short bursts of meows.|`|KJDH7ShNaa	wow pretty cool. next time try to get it on video.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	When a cat kills prey, it bites down quickly several times.  The “chatter” is simulating the cat’s behavior at the time of attack.  Alternatively, it’s pure and simple frustration.  When a cat is stalking or killing a bird, they’re almost invariably completely silent.  It’s when they are shut off from the prey that they chatter.|`|NGmRMqe6aa	Cats are very vocal and can make amazing sounds. They have a chatter that some make when they are on the alert.

8038b3adc016b548c310b6c4926bb475aa	Why not save a life and adopt one from your local animal shelter?|`|4aAhEK9daa	DON'T buy a cat from a pet store or get a "free" kitten from craigslist or the paper.  Cats and kittens at pet stores come from "cat mills" where litters are churned out with all the focus on profit and NONE on the wellbeing of the animals.  And there's no such thing as "free" when it comes to kittens - you have to pay to get them spayed/neutered, shots, etc, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  If you want a cat go adopt one from a shelter.  For an adoption fee of around $100 you'll get a cat that's already spayed or neutered, up to date on shots, deflead, dewormed, tested for disease and microchipped.  If you do all of that on your own with a "free" kitten or one you buy from someone out of the paper you'll end up paying $300-$400 to do all those things on your own.<br>  <br>  The colour of cat you're describing is called "Tortoiseshell" and quite commonly seen at shelters.  Just type in your zip code and look through the available cats at www.petfinder.com  Do pick a cat over a kitten.  With kittens you never know what they'll be like as adults - while with adult cats the personality is right there before you.  I have three cats all adopted as adults from shelters and they're the sweetest, most loveable and most playful cats I've ever known - far so more than ones I've had since kittenhood!<br>  <br>  edit:  Beckie F made an EXCELLENT point.  A lot of the "free" cats and kittens out there end up being quite sickly.  People with "free" kittens have cats that got pregnant most likely because they didn't bother to spay the cat and allowed it to free roam.  So their cat could have Feline Leukemia or FIV and her kittens as well.  A "free" kitten could end up quite sickly and costing you a fortune in vet bills - if not dying.  Definitely get one from a shelter - where they're screened for diseases and healthy when adopted out.|`|GUEsVdaFaa	I found my cat on craigslist. I paid $7 for him and he's half Siamese. If they don't have anything in your area that you like you can post an ad that tells what you want and see if anyone responds to it. <br>  <br>  Or, you can try animal shelters. They normally have their critters posted on their website, an getting an animal from a shelter will ensure you that you're not only helping the animal population but you're also getting a healthy kitty. <br>  <br>  Or, you can look in your local newspaper classifieds. Call around and see what's available.|`|QL56syElaa	Go to craiglist.com and search under your area..<br>  You can also post ur own in craiglist under wanted!..then describe the cat you want and how much you have to offer...and you may be suprised about how many calls you get...there are many cats and owners that need to get rid of their litter!|`|TEG6O7sDaa	Look in the Free section of your local paper, freecycle.com, cheapcycle.com, go rescue a cat from your local animal shelter or local cat rescue, contact local vets in your area to see if they have any adoptees in their facility or know on someone who is giving/selling a cat.

8038b3adc016b548c310b6c4926bb475aa	And your point would be...what?
KsQ2EftYaa	From a responsible breeder anywhere from $1000 to 1500 & up.  Never ever buy from a large volume breeder or pet store.  Only from a breeder with many years experience & raises the dogs in their home - and it's reasonably clean.  <br>  Pet stores charge way more for bad quality dogs.  <br>  Research the breed thru the American Kennel Club website - also google Airedales - there is a National Club.  They have lots of good breeders.  You should be able to find one easily, but be prepared to wait for a puppy unless you just end up having very good luck with timing.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Don't buy from any website esp. Nextdaypets - those are only byb pups.<br>  <br>  A decent airedale would start at least $1000+ & should be health tested esp. the hips.  You get what you pay for - buying a cheap pup from crappy breeders will only end up costing more money in vet bills. Check thru airedale rescue or breed club for adoptions or breeder referrals or attend dog shows for breeder referral. Even show breeders sell pet quality pups - not every pup will show quality in the litters & you will get a quality dog. Terriers are very prone to skin allergies & issues so be certain of your pup lineage before buying.|`|qn4yFwGYaa	They range from about 300-500 dollars<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nextdaypets.com/directory/dogs/49d4a1bb-cd01.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextdaypets.com/directory/dog...</a>  300<br>  <a href="http://www.nextdaypets.com/directory/dogs/53092f73-6991.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nextdaypets.com/directory/dog...</a>   500<br>  <br>  It depends on the qualities and bloodlines.

hC4Z8HIbaa	I would not allow them to continue to live together. Just because they are cuddly now does not mean that tomorrow you won't wake up to find two disemboweled little mice. Rats are omnivorous, which means they eat meats and plants. They either eat meat that was left from another killing, or they will kill the animal themselves. The rat could see the mice as a threat and easily kill them. I would suggest separating them and getting another (male) rat for your current rat.<br>  <br>  Please check out the website below. It has a lot of good information about quarantining and introductions which you will need to do when you get your new rattie. I am a member there, and I know that the members are very knoledgable about rats and anything rat-related.|`|XurYYreBaa	Keep a *very* close eye on them, as rats (even dwarf ones) will nearly always attack mice.  They won't be able to have babies btw, so that's not a problem.<br>  You might want to talk to the place you got your little guys since you lost one-- they could give you some insight on what happened & help keep the others healthy.  Also, it would be better to adopt another rat (dwarf or not) istead of keeping him with the mice.|`|ooNKCmChaa	Generally mixing species of rodents is a bad idea, especially with rats. Dwarf rats are simply a type of genetically mutated fancy rat, and aside from their size are exactly the same type of animal. Mice are completely different, and thus your dwarf rat and your mice will not be able to interbreed. Rats are highly intelligent omnivores, and have been known to hunt and kill other, smaller species of rodents. While there haven't been any problems thus far--and may not have any problems, I personally would not risk the safety of my pets, and would find a more suitable companion for your rat.
mpGjPV6Xaa	You should take the cat to the vet and let them see what's actually wrong with it. They'll tell you if they're able to help it or if nothing can be done and you have only 1 choice but to put it down.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped !!!<br>  <br>  Joseph D : )|`|igI5yX0vaa	I would get the vet's opinion.|`|f1gmEmUTaa	Any animal hit by a car has an uncertain future. First the cat needs a doctor. Take it to a vet, only they are qualified to examine it and give you the damage report. Then what will happen is they will make a recommendation, which is what you have to decide. Some animals can be saved but they will never have the quality of life they had before. Some can be successfully rehabilitated and be as physically sound as they were prior to the accident. Some can be fixed, but it will cost you an astronomical amount of money. The things you need to consider are the animals quality of life after wards and the cost to you. If either are too great, then it may be best to have the animal humanely euthanized. It isn't' easy, but it may be for the best. In your case the arm may need to be amputated, but you may also be ok. If you do decide to put it down, then the only advice I can give you for your seven year old is what my mother told me when we had to have the dog I had as a child put down. Tell him that the pet is in heaven and is waiting for him. Again I'm sorry you have to make the choice.|`|ZvKw1XDmaa	You need to take your cat to the vet NOW!!! To not do so is considered animal neglect, and you could be charged criminally. Take it to the vet!<br>  <br>  EDIT: How do you expect us to examine the animal for you? To judge for you, without seeing it, whether it will need to be put down or not? Of course we will tell you to take it to the vet. If you had time to post on here about it, you obviously aren't taking it to the vet straight away.|`|9LNtTfmgaa	If you know the cat should be taken to a vet, why are you asking?

You did post any other information stating whether you had already seen a vet or spoken to one.

There's really not much else anyone can tell you besides take the cat to the vet.|`|0RU2O197aa	ya me too i would check with your vet. he might just need surgery or he might need a cast for broken bones or whatever or maybe something more serious. i would check with your vet first because if it can be fixed there is really no sense in putting him down but if it can't be fixed then that's a different story. talk with your vet and see what he has to say about it.|`|b50Oz78caa	are you SERIOUS???   what do you think you should do????  get the poor thing to the vet...honestly most of you people posting such questions on line don't deserve to even have animals.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't be letting the cat out either if you don't even know how he was injured.  outside cats can pick up many diseases that can be transmitted to your child and usually end up smashed on the road.<br>  <br>  you are not teaching your son how to be a responsible pet owner.|`|5VhhxFRDaa	try taking your cat to the vet immediately, ecspecially if it seems to be in pain. my cat decided to attempt being friends with a raccoon (he's very friendly) ,but ofcourse he didn't realize that the raccoon was an enemy. he almost got his tail ripped off and had to get surgery. you never know, it might be better than it looks or it might be worse than it looks. you should really get it to a vet.......really.|`|J28SuSsJaa	I'd advise you to take him to a vet, (duh...

IYd6bw7Gaa	As the other answer said, you need seperate cages for all those hamsters.<br>  <br>  I have had dwarf hamsters and both became mean over time.  They were super sweet for a few months and then starting biting.  The syrians I have had much better luck with.  I have only been bitten once and that was because she was scared and jsut got home from the pet store.  My boyfriend has some really nice dwarf hamsters though so they aren't all mean.  <br>  <br>  I have an OVO and dont really like it.  The ventilation is poor, they break rather easily ( I work at a petstore and customers are always bringing them back broken), the wheel is rather loud.  I would buy a cage with wire sides and plastic levels.  I am happy with those.  The cage I bought from Petsmart is by Prevue. I bought a Silent Spinner because I swear to those and the one that came with the cage is rather small for a syrian.  <br>  <a href="http://www.pets-warehouse.com/pic-s/SPV2040.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pets-warehouse.com/pic-s/SPV2...</a>|`|hQQuqyYcaa	I hope the hamsters are in separate cages. As for dwarf vs. syrian...I've had syrians and I absolutely loved them, but there have been a few dwarf hamsters that I liked. I work at Petsmart and have noticed more dwarf hamsters tend to bite than the syrians, but it depends on the hamster's personality. If the dwarf hamster can't climb up in the tubes of the Habitrail, then I would recommend switching it out for a different cage. I would recommend a wire cage with a metal bottom. The ones with the tubes can be hard to clean, and hamsters can chew plastic.
cnZlMojUaa	My dog will occasionally whine with his Kong. He is really good about getting the treats out, so I will often wedge them in really tight or stick them inside with peanut butter. He whines from frustration because it is taking too long to get the goody. He will toss the Kong in the air and bounce it trying to knock the treats out. He can play with it for hours. Kongs are great!|`|AA10112346	Mine, whines too and her "chin" gets stuck on the hole in the kong and it pops in and out. Like a cup on your chin, the suction and stuff.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't happen to your dog I guess he is frustated.|`|hfR74VHMaa	My dog used to whine at the kong until I took it away from her... She was chewing so much that her gums started to bleed. Your dog might just be frustrated but if his/her gums or mouth begins to bleed, I would suggest to take it away|`|UE4WbmtQaa	he's perfectly fine. he'll figure it out. he's just thinking and he's getting frustrated. other dogs do this too, mine did once.|`|RWgjnwl9aa	I always put a chew bone inside it so maybe he's looking for something to work at & yeah these Kongs' are the greatest but try this & see what happens|`|peXKq1B6aa	Sometimes my dog gets frustrated when he can't get the treat out of the Kong so he will whine a bit lol
fgxajTiBaa	No one disses mixed breeds, I swear that's how all you people justify this to yourself that everyone HATES mutts. WE are the ones who care about mutts, because WE hate to see them dying in shelters because there are irresponsible people breeding them. If we lived in a world where every dog born had a home then I could care less what people bought/bred. Until that day I think anyone breeding mutts is incredibly irresponsible.<br>  <br>  Legit: Voila <a href="http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/displaypet.cgi?petid=13043229" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com/petnote/display...</a> Cocker Spaniel Lab mix<br>  <br>  There are a million and one lab mixes in shelters, they are the most common dogs dying. I would never tell someone where they could purchase one of these dogs from a greeder.|`|PM23RDycaa	Nope. Can't help you. Doesn't matter if you are in the US or Austrailia. MUTTS should not be bred on purpose. Go to your local petshop if you want one so bad, just don't come crying to use when it has all sorts of behavioral and genetic issues because it was bred by someone looking to make a PROFIT and not produce a health animal.<br>  <br>  Good breeders don't breed mutts. Have fun reporting.<br>  <br>  ADD: shelters, bybs and puppymills/petshops. i am sure if you look hard enough you can ONE with your mutt flavor of choice|`|0EqaNvygaa	Sorry you are having such a hard time finding one.  I am in Washington state and don't know of any there, sorry.  I think the SPANADORS are wonderful dogs.  I just got one she is very sweet.   Mine was $125 and worth every penny.  Some are more depending on breeder.  People don't like 50% one breed and 50% another.  They make think it is a mutt.  They are not, even most of the so called pure breeds out there has that % to get there breed.  I love shih-tzu too and they where make this way.  They are also very good dogs and not mutts.  I wish you the best on finding your puppy.  I don't know why others want to make you find what they think is best.  I would do what you think is best for you.  Don't worry or take these mean people to heart.  I am so sick of those kind of people trying to force shelter dogs on you.  It is still our choice and yes if that is what a family would like it is great.  I try helping out shelter's all the time.  There are other way to help the shelter's too.  Good luck to you|`|49ec8e0944023c0f5c20e37484f16366aa	A shelter would be your best bet to find a mixed breed dog.  Nobody with a well-bred, genetic tested, titled purebred would dream of a mixed breeding.  Any pup you would find marketed as such, would most likely be in a pet store, those puppies come from puppy mills.|`|Bw18seFqaa	no, I dont know anyone selling mutts.

MzHwklzKaa	I've worked in shelters and vet offices and have taken calls from people who say<br>  <br>  "How do I get out of the spay/neuter contract?"<br>  <br>  And<br>  <br>  "What would happen if we signed a spay/neuter agreement, but we decided to have just 1 litter?<br>  <br>  The only sure thing is doing the surgery before the dog leaves your "custody".  <br>  <br>  It's rare that the surgery kills the animal.  It's rare that an animal is too fragile to undergo surgery.<br>  <br>  We shelter workers take just as much care of the adopted animals as we do our own.  If you've had a bad experience, it's just that, 1 bad experience.  For the most part, shelters are doing all they can to get animals into homes.<br>  <br>  The easiest, cheapest, best, most humane way to stop the pet over population problem is spay/neuter.|`|AA11992723	depends. I rescued my dog from someone who claimed to be with a rescue organization. I gave her $50 and signed a contract. When I gave her proof that he was neutered, I would get my $50 back. He turned 6 months and I did neuter him at that time. I never gave the woman proof, and she's never checked up on me. He is now 1.5 years old. so in some cases, the rescue workers are too overwhelmed with their work to follow up with every single person, and just hope that $50 is enough incentive, which to many people will NOT be because if they want to BYB, they THINK theyll make more than $50.<br>  <br>  (In this case, the woman turned out to be an illegitimate rescue organization, she actually purchased puppies from puppymills and sold them for $250 advertised on petfinder....so yes that is the real reason why she never checked up on me, but I imagine many LEGIT rescue workers will not all do it)|`|Jguzosm2aa	Depends on the conditions of the contract. At the shelter where I volunteer, the contract would have been overlooked or changed in cases where the vet gave other advice. We don't have a vet on hand, though. <br>  <br>  In cases such as your first example, the date of the contract would be extended to a more reasonable date. However, five months is not really a big difference, and some vets not only do but even recommend spaying/neutering at fourteen weeks or less. We'd extend it at the recommendation of a vet (in this situation), but probably not just because the owner was insistent. Especially with small dogs (though I don't know if this is the case for you).  With dogs significantly younger,  it wouldn't be so much a question of if but when. <br>  <br>  In cases such as the second, the contract would be overlooked. <br>  <br>  I do think there are cases that should be over looked. But I also think it should only be with a written advisory or phone call from your vet.|`|TPirHBDjaa	I think it's a good way to prevent the dog/puppy from being used as a breeding dog... but I think that dogs should not be spayed until after 1 year old because otherwise they can get bone cancer when they're spayed too young.|`|gjD8pndjaa	I think its always good unless they force it under medical conditions- which very few do|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	yes as  the lady my sisters friend bought his cat off has a contract to have the cats she sells spayed and neutered|`|fgxajTiBaa	Spaying/Neutering can be safely done as young as 8 weeks of age. The ONLY exception I have heard to that is with giant breeds developing bone problems, but even that I'm skeptical about.<br>  <br>  As they have already demonstrated, the general public cannot own an unaltered animal without just 'having' to have one litter. By requiring spay/neuter the shelter gets rid of any chance of that. Our shelter won't let any animal leave without being neutered/spayed. Even our smaller animals. Unless a vet says it is completely unsafe to perform an alter on an animal I think it should be done, end of story.<br>  <br>  Add: 'Shelter Puppies' I too rescued my dog from a woman who had a few dogs that she had shipped up from NC kill shelter. She had me sign a spay/neuter contract, but about 7 months later she hasn't contacted me to make sure I neutered my dog. I did, but she hasn't made any effort to check. She luckily though was a legit rescue because I contacted the kill shelter he came from to make sure he was actually there.|`|bghHMy22aa	i think it defiantly the right thing to do if your not going to breed the dog as it can stop cancer with both sex's and the safety of not having pups with the female dog|`|dWed21jUaa	Only for medical reasons where a vet says This animal is not healthy enough to be spayed/neutered.  and most places will understand that as long as  VET states it|`|peXKq1B6aa	YES YES YES!!!!! Unless it is a show-quality dog and you are a REPUTABLE show kennel.|`|7TKRtDanaa	I think it is a good example of the worst characteristics of humans. We know whats good for everyone and everything, unless they are beautifull enough to show off they should never be allowed to have sex or reproduce. Thats a shame so many people think that way. We have no right chopping off prvates of every animal we can get our hands on. let the dogs be.

As long as the dog is healthy enough to undergo surgery, it should be fine.  At this age, one month before six months of age isn't usually a problem.  Some dogs do go in heat a little early.<br>  <br>  Had the vet felt the surgery wasn't safe for the dog at this time, he would have told you and the shelter would either extend the contract, or would have told you to forget about spaying/neutering if the vet felt it unsafe to do the surgery later on.  You, the vet, and the shelter would have gotten together on this one.  But five months isn't too early.  Most vets can't guess the exact age, anyway.  They can only guess within a month or so of the exact age.|`|yEUo24Znaa	I raise pedigreed Dachshunds for bench and field. As such, I occaisionally have puppies for sale.  NONE of them leave my property without being altered first, by my vet, and the purchase price of said pup reflects that expense. I also do not let a pup go before 6 months old and basic obedience and house training completed.    I have taken in dogs that were in one way or another not fit for surgery. My vet's recommendation plus aa second opinion from a randomly selected vet has remedied the issue.  I currently own an Australian Dingo who can not be spayed due to immune mediated hemolytic anemia.  The surgery alone would kill her, much less the removal of tissues.  If rescues demand spay neuter, then they should not offer the dog until the appropriate age or the surgery is already done.
Bw18seFqaa	If you want to train him to go outside, you are better off to forget the whole puppy pad thing and train him to go outside.<br>  <br>  Take him out at least every hour (if he pees before the hour is up, he needs out more often than that)..  and also after meals and naps.<br>  <br>  Try to get him out before he needs to go.  Take him out on a leash and tell him to "go potty" (or whatever other command you want to use).. if he acts distracted, gently tug the leash and remind him "go potty"..  when he goes, praise like crazy!<br>  <br>  If you catch him pottying in the house, firmly tell him "NO", then take him straight outside to finish, praise outside, even if he dribbles thru the house on your way to the door!<br>  <br>  If you find a mess, but did not see him do it.. take a rolled up newspaper..  now smack yourself over the head!  BAD OWNER!  You did not supervise him!<br>  <br>  Clean up all messes with a good enzymatic cleaner meant for pet messes.  Remeber that his nose is more sensitive than yours.. and if it smells like a bathroom, then it must be a bathroom.<br>  <br>  Supervise closely..  use baby gates to limit his access to the household.. you can also leash him to you.  When you cant supervise, use a crate.  He should also be crated at nite.<br>  <br>  The crate should only be big enough for him to turn around and lay down.  If its too big he will potty in the crate, which defeats the purpose of crate training.  Dont leave him crated more than 2-3 hours without a potty break.|`|cqLYkuz8aa	Puppy pad training advice: Don't use them. <br>  <br>  Puppy pads train your pup to urinate and defecate on a soft flat surface in your house, and puppies don't necessarily differentiate between a puppy pad and a rug or blanket. <br>  <br>  As for converting to outside, it won't be difficult to teach him how to go outside, but it will be VERY difficult to teach him that he can no longer go inside.|`|O6OUeThgaa	to train your dog you have to keep him in 1 place then you secure the area witha gate then you put a large pad next where he eats and drinks. when you see him peeing or pooing in dfferent areas lock him in his area until h pees or ppops in the diaper. after that un lock him now dont take out or replace the diaper he will smeell his dodo and he will always know to poop and pee there al the time . but put the diaper in a good place!  if you puppy wants to go outside he will sit by the door and always take him outside about 2 or 3 times a day. that will make him poo and pee an the grass also.|`|7EShF2zFaa	i would by a cage big enough for the dog and put him in it when you're going out and put the pads in there. but when you're at home i would watch to see if he is sniffing the ground and if he is he's trying to find a suitable place to poop or urinate. take the dog outside if he's doing that, let him do his business the pads are letting him know that it is ok to potty inside, so i would only use the pads when you're leaving.|`|KsQ2EftYaa	Once you train them to go inside, it's not hard to train them to go outside, it's just hard to UNtrain them from going inside.<br>  I don't recommend it unless you want puppy pads in your house forever.|`|okAYAGvXaa	Puppy pads is one of the most moronic "inventions" of man kind.<br>  Forget it.

If alone, the egg is not going to be fertile (obviously), but you should NOT remove them until she has lost interest in them.  Removing them too soon will only prompt her to lay more eggs which can be bad for her as it will deplete her calcium.  Make sure and give her a supplement to help her replace it.  Once she looses interest, you can toss them.  If there is a male..then it is possible that at least a few will be fertile and she may incubate them until they hatch.|`|6014e877df433a9c4aa2133e5b670a4faa	Hurry and sit on it!|`|ZAljSeERaa	im going threw this with my hq macaw right now she just laid her first egg (since being with me ) 8 days ago she laid then another 4 days later! you have to make sure that you leave the egg in there! if you take it out and she is still nesty then her body will tell her to lay again! you need to watch her also to make sure she doesnt become egg bond if a bird becomes egg bond they will die if not taken to the vet 911! to keep her from becoming egg bond you have to make sure she is gettin enough calicum make sure she is warm and keep moisture in the air! if you need to you can email me if you get worried cherries_angela@yahoo.com|`|pfOU3I7Zaa	my new and past cockatiels have laid eggs too...

ld2vmypNaa	They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them in the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They NEED calcium and protein they get it from the fish meat and the fish bones. Drop 20 or 30 or so feeder guppies or small goldfish or minnows they maybe a bit fast for babies at first just drop in the tank and watch them disappear in a few days! The more they eat the healthier the turtle.<br>  **** If these are hatchlings a 1” and a tad over they may need to have their live food half dead by leaving the fish out of water for a few minutes (10minutes) and put in the tank. That way the baby can get the meat he needs and the fish can’t out run the baby turtle.<br>  They can have garden worms which I collect after a good rain and dump them un the pond, also meal worms, snails, crickets, flies, crayfish small frogs, slugs, tadpoles ,dragon flies and anything that moves, but only as a treat.<br>  They need leafy greens Romaine, Butter lettuce. (Iceberg and cabbage are bad for them, any other leafy greens will do) for vitamin A that they need at least 4 to 5 times a week.<br>  They love grapes and strawberries and squash , apples.<br>  <br>  These turtles in captivity do not hibernate their eating may slow down some but they will not hibernate. They cannot hear or see well so they feel you coming by the vibrations each foot step take.<br>  <br>  Plus some leafy green and vitamin A fruits cut up a few times a week. Swollen cloudy eyes comes from lack of Vitamin A. Which we all need for good eyes. <br>  They will bite very very hard. Under 4" they carry a disease called 'salmonella'. So you must wash after every handling ANY size turtle.. ***And my pictures don't lie. All ages and all sizes get along as long as their is allot for swim room and plenty to eat! They can become cannibalistic if you have 2 or more turtles and a small environment. They will kill off the smallest and then fight for the tank for themselves.<br>  <br>  ***Some sicknesses they get easily Like shell its actual holes rotting through the shell. <br>  Respiratory sickness, lopsided swimming, coughing, vomiting, blowing bubbles from their nose. .<br>  Fungus white cotton patches on their skin.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N03/sets/72157612827773738/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/29035692@N0...</a>|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Peek is the "pro" here.

My gerbils mostly want to run around and wrestle with eachother XD<br>  <br>  Earlier today my hamster was on the computer-- LITERALLY! He was crawling all over the keyboard, and my fingers. He kept making me mess up on my typing! My hammer (hamster) was also on my shoulder sniffing inside my ear, it felt very very wierd XD I don't know if any of these things I'm saying are considered tame, but the one tame thing about everything I said, is that he never runs away :'D Today, my hamster ran to my shoulder, went into my shirt, and climbed down my back! Then he kept going onto my shoulder OVER and OVER again and everytime I kept putting him back down in my lap but he just kept running up to my shoulder over and over again. It was so cute ha ha<br>  <br>  If anyone has any questions or needs any help on mice, rats, hamsters and gerbils email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com|`|A2IDiIpIaa	I have three rats and one of them is crawling on me right now!

8786e426eb830d7eccdbed5c73b39ec7aa	evrything that phunk said is correct<br>  the crickets exoskeloton can cause impaction in the intestines, but they prob wont eat them anyways but you should get rid em and feed them dead (frozen) mice.  I knew one person who dipped the dead mice or pinkies in campbells chicken soup broth before feeding them, when the snake wouldnt eat.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	Don't worry about it -- snakes can go a while between meals... just don't take too long to get those mice!  No, they won't eat the crickets, you should clear them out.|`|b88691c1425e641c73274dcb27f8a891aa	First of all, it's a shame that you prefer your snake to eat live mice. There are many reasons out there that are against feeding live. First of all, it is inhumane to the mouse. Second, a live mouse is more likely to be carrying parasites that could harm your snake, whereas a dead, frozen/thawed mouse will not. Freezing the mouse kills off any live parasites. Feeding live pinkies and fuzzies is fine because they can't fight back, but once your snake starts eating on larger mice, those mice will be scared and are going to fight back and a bite to the snake from a mouse is not a pretty thing to deal with..<br>  <br>  Regarding your main question, snakes can go weeks, even months, without eating food, so you shouldn't worry about your snake eating one meal. Your decision to try to feed your snake crickets might have been a bad one. Due to a cricket's hard exoskeleton, if your snake had eaten them, the hard exoskeleton would have damaged the insides of the snake and could potentionally cause death.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	do not feed snakes bugs.it will be fine till you get mice
JgC9a8m2aa	If you're looking for something inside the cage, climbing branches and ledges work well. You should give them some out of cage time daily as well. BTW, don't use those running balls - they're too small for chinchillas and they could over-heat while in one. During out of cage time, they should just be out running, not stuck in a ball. It's a good idea if you can chin-proof one room for them to have run of. For toys, you can use wood to make climbing shelves (my dad made a couple out of pine for mine and they love it - good for chewing on, too), some type of tunnels to run through, etc. They're climbers and jumpers, so pretty much anything that they can climb and jump on makes a great toy for a chin.|`|I5pUxwPbaa	i just read an article about chinchillas...they suggest the wheel idea first, and also to let him out at least once a day to run around in a safe area where he can't escape.|`|vqoQW11baa	I have a Chinchilla and the best thing for them to exercise with is ledges. If you get one or two you can put them on opposite edges of the cage.

I've heard quite a few stories about dogs getting their jaws stuck in another dog's collar during unsupervised play, but after the death of a friend's dog while it was crated during a flight I made sure to get breakaway collars for my dogs.  The dog choked itself to death, because of it's struggles when the collar getting caught on the crate wires.<br>  <br>  Aspen pet Breakaway collars are for cats.  KeepSafe is the only reliable brand of breakaway collars I know and use for my dogs.<br>  <br>  I only make my dogs wear it when they're crated for flights or long road trips.  Generally it takes a firm tug to get it to break.  KeepSafe also makes a "PlaySafe" collar that has the breakaway feature, but is made with velcro so one can still grab a hold of a dog and keep control of it without the collar breaking apart, but if you're only interested in having the dogs wear breakaway collars when crated I would stick with the original breakaway collar.|`|uKOYK1Lvaa	*I* think they break to easily.

Their favourite food is also snails.<br>  <br>  Just stick with the platies and guppies (and snails if you want).<br>  <br>  Ian|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	Bala sharks get big and might eat the guppies. Most Puffers need barckish water and are aggressive. But guppies and platys are great together they get along with many other peaceful fish of similar size|`|Yztrofywaa	The sharks can be aggressive and depending on their size, they may eat smaller fish like guppies and platies. I'm not sure about the puffer, I have never had one. The snail will probably be okay, it will just chill on the glass and suck away at the slime. If you have a big enough tank and plenty of hiding spaces like alcoves and wood or something, you can probably get away with it. As for happy? Well all fish have different personalities so who could really say?|`|zqVDJxUIaa	Bala sharks are generally peaceful, as long as other fish don't disturb them. Guppies and platys are extremely peaceful, and all three should be ok together, as long as you provide lots of hiding places such as plants, driftwood, etc. I've never heard of an indian puffer.|`|asXq2cFDaa	Take out the balas and puffer. Those puffers need perfect water condition and don't play well with others, they can easily take down a fish 3x it's size, and they love to nip fins! Not good for community tanks.|`|DU7iO8EHaa	the puffers will eat smaller fish. Like guppies. And having guppies they will reproduce every 4 weeks. up to 90 fry per every four weeks.|`|Nzb5QmNXaa	Both my bala sharks are over a foot long. That's 11 inches longer than a guppy. You could fit 100 guppies in one full grown bala shark. They are semi-aggressive fish and they will eat/attack snails, platies and guppies.|`|raSr9PYhaa	the puffers will eat smaller fish.

I55JNnvpaa	I will really take hard work, and would definetly no doubt need lessons if you want to show.|`|jV7SmnaTaa	I was a barrel racer for most of my life. When I went to college, I realized that they made us all go back to doing dressage and hunt (including over fences!). So, after a near panic attack - I took a few lessons and learned that I LOVE it! I figured out the whole diagonals thing for posting in one lesson and the jumping thing wasn't a big deal (I had trail ridden for years and had done lots of fun jumping). If you have a good dependable horse that's been over jumps before you shouldn't have a problem - but, I wouldn't start out with one that doesn't know how to jump and then you end up banging it in the mouth and creating a horse that won't jump! Best wishes!|`|rbLdJ6Iiaa	no not really. i first rode western and now i ride english, and i found the transition pretty easy, and FUN. i thought english was so much more fun. the thing you have to get used to is the shorter stirrups, for ages i thought my instructor was crazy for keeping them that short! then i got used to them and realized that that was normal for english riding. and also you have much more contact on the horse's mouth, so you use your hands a lot different. the cues are a little different i think but other than that i really enjoyed switching to english.|`|ujuY7pPZaa	easily done... you will be sore the first couple of time, it does use a different set of muscles to a certain degree. But you should be able to pick up on it quickly. Getting some help from a friend or someone you know who does english will definatly help.|`|z6OqBkBGaa	nope i did it, just take it easy the first few times and i would suggest haveing sumone who rides english to help u out with jumping.. that way it helps u out. GOOD LUCK!~|`|rCeD6nffaa	I dont know.. But i have the same question CANT WAIT to see these answers!!! : )|`|2g1rxroVaa	lol who knows|`|AA11649443	im a wester rider i taught myself how to ride English...|`|LAXxaxAZaa	I'm not sure... I went from English to Western. But it certainly wouldn't be harder than it would be for a person who doesn't ride to learn English. In fact, it would be much easier.|`|pUpPXNzLaa	English is harder to learn. Western is harder to actually do. But they really even out when it comes to jumping vs barrels. Get a trainer! :)|`|Xobbmd7Saa	It wouldn't be easy, learning a new discipline never is, but take some lessons and since you have already ridden western, you should learn faster since you already know horse safety and all that. But the gaits are more foward and the strides tend to be longer and jumping will be a new sensation for you as well as getting used to a new kind of saddle with closer contact to your horse.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!|`|u1HahCoqaa	You could, although I think it would be easier to go the other way. They really are very different, but who knows, maybe you will like it!   And I know someone will say "You can jump with a western saddle" and yes, technically you can, but not well, or very high.|`|5ee2106949bcd1e92ad6150f154711eaaa	i feel like (and no one take this the wrong way) every ridder should have ridden english at one time. I would pick up lessons. English and western are two totally diffrent types of ridding both with there own challenges. I don;t know how these western ridders taught themselfs how to ride english...? haha.|`|YQgSrJI6aa	I used to ride western but now I ride english and personally I love it a tonne more and it is very easy to pick up. It only took me a few months to adjust.. I'm sure you'll love it (:<br>  Best Of Luck !
d6dfbfe62a28bcf8a780c369dc109fd8aa	Quite the interesting question.<br>  <br>  And even a more interesting answer....it depends on how you shake it.<br>  Specifically, shaken cat syndrome (scs) only occurs when you hold the cat's front left leg and tail simultaneously, and shake vigorously (and thoroughly, I might add). <br>  <br>  If you try to shake the cat by holding its two front legs, two back legs, or any combination of the two, nothing at all will happen. In actuality, you will only end up with a very humorous incident, fit for youtube!|`|b50Oz78caa	where do you people come up with these questions and WHY?  makes me wonder how you are taking care of the cat, that's for sure|`|5LoWcL6Laa	If you did this why are you taking the time to ask for help.....you need to stay away from animals|`|MsHIb2oLaa	I would think so as the brain can be seperated from the skull|`|AA11012659	Why are you even asking this?? I sure as heck hope you are not abusing your cat !!|`|m0a7Ox1maa	Yes, a cat be shaken to death - just as animal that can be picked up can be shaken to death|`|uKpWUPEUaa	I'm sure a cat at any age could get that whole thing. But yea and i don't think it's called that
eyZwqIqsaa	Hand feed. Make him realize that you are not taking his food but that your hands are friendly and the food comes from there.<br>  It is called food aggression and is very common, however needs to be handled quick before it gets worse. <br>  <br>  Look at the link below. It gives you some advise on what to do.|`|csDhZDvraa	Feed him all his meals from your hands so he understands your hands=Good things and are part of his master.<br>  <br>  NEVER hit him or be mean to him with your hands.<br>  <br>  Feed him twice a day. Praise him while he eats and say the command "Okay Eat"<br>  <br>  EDIT: Puppy classes as listed below are also a wonderful idea. Please consider this for you and your Pitt Bull puppy. :)|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	correct him tap on his nose and  remove the food|`|U0v0zrriaa	Use an assertive tone and tell him no when he does that. He's testing you and you need to show that he isn't the boss. A pop on the nose never heard a dog either. Don't hit just pop to get his attention. It's all about tone though really. Your the boss so start acting like it|`|706142df2b644f71545bbc49b36d5cceaa	Take away the food wait till the dogs moves onto something else and forgets about the episode give the food back attempt to reach in again repeat as needed soon your dog will learn that the behavior will not be rewarded it will go away classic extinction technique.|`|BDRIeLqUaa	you and your pet need puppy class- it is the best way to raise a happy 4 legged memeber of your family|`|TpVtNEwBaa	if he is growling at you he does not see you as the boss therefore you have no right to his stuff. You have to teach him you are the boss especially when it comes to food. Get his food bowl and hold it down to him and let him have a bite or two, then take it away and make him sit before you give it back. do that a few times. Then after that before you feed him make him sit and wait for his food and if he gets up you take the food away,<br>  <br>  Puppy classes are usually a scam,they wont teach you anything you cant learn on your own. Making any animal understand you control the food is an instinctual lesson and can be translated by any species.
AQsiugSpaa	Hi Yessi,<br>  <br>  Tuxedo refers to cats that are black and white, because they "resemble" the black and white fancy tuxedos that are worn for formal occasions. Some black and white cats actually have a white chest with the rest of the kitty all black. With the exception of a bow tie, it can look very much like a furry "tuxedo".<br>  <br>  Here is a great website about Tuxedos!<br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/582149/tuxedo_cat_facts_and_tidbits.html?cat=53" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  <br>  So if you have a black and white mixed breed kitty ( there are purebred cats that are black and white) then you have a "Tuxedo" about which to brag.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  Member Cat Writer's Association|`|m0a7Ox1maa	tuxedo is a colour pattern<br>  <br>  your cat would be a DSH - domestic short hair<br>  without papers all cats are moggies - long haired or short haired moggies|`|kd9kWB8Kaa	just a black cat with markings of white that look like he is wearing a tux|`|0AEi70ywaa	Nearly all typical house cats are referred to as DSH (Domestic Short Hairs)<br>  This includes tuxedos, tabbies, and calicos, and all the colors in between.<br>  So no, tuxedo is not a breed, it's just a reference for a particular color of DSHs.<br>  <br>  Then there are DLH (domestic long hairs.)<br>  Of course, there are persians, siamese, absynnians.  But most likely you don't have one of these unless you bought from a breeder.|`|4aAhEK9daa	"Everywhere?"  Please show me.

Cats that have a white chest or a white streak down the chest are called tuxedos because they look like they are wearing a black tux.  I have  a tuxedo cat, and he is very handsome.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	"Tuxedo" is not a breed of cat, and neither is a "calico" or a "tabby". They are words used to describe what colors or patters they have in their fur. <br>  <br>  More info:<br>  A domestic shorthaired cat (DSH) is a cat fancy term used to describe a shorthaired cat that does not have a pedigree or belong to a recognized cat breed. The domestic shorthair should not be confused with the American Shorthair, which is a Cat Fanciers' Association (CFA) recognized breed.<br>  <br>  Domestic shorthaired cats are characterized by a wide range of coloring and typically 'revert to type' after a few generations, which means they express their coats as a tabby. This can be any color or combination of colors. They also exhibit a wide range of physical characteristics and, as a result, domestic shorthaired cats in different countries tend to look different in body shape and size, as they are working from differing gene pools. DSH cats in Asia tend to have a build similar to a purebred Siamese cat or Tonkinese cat, while European and American varieties have a thicker, heavier build.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here's a list of breeds recognized by the Cat Fanciers' Association: Abyssinian, American Bobtail, American Curl, American Shorthair, American Wirehair, Balinese, Birman, Bombay, British Shorthair, Burmese, Chartreux, Colorpoint Shorthair, Cornish Rex, Devon Rex, Egyptian Mau, European Burmese, Exotic, Havana Brown, Japanese Bobtail, Javanese, Korat, LaPerm, Maine Coon, Manx, Norwegian Forest Cat, Ocicat, Oriental, Persian, RagaMuffin, Ragdoll, Russian Blue, Scottish Fold, Selkirk Rex, Siamese, Siberian, Singapura, Somali, Sphynx, Tonkinese, Turkish Angora, Turkish Van. <br>  <br>  Check out this link for the history, personality and physical characteristics of each breed: <a href="http://animal.discovery.com/breedselector/catselectorindex.do" rel="nofollow">http://animal.discovery.com/breedselecto...</a>|`|PrZHEy6taa	No. Its just a color name for a common domestic shorthair. Which is really just a (mutt) in the cat world. Just like there is a calico, marmalade, tortoise shell, tabby, etc.. They are all domestic shorthair cats. <br>  <br>  The really confusing one is the fact that there is a pure breed cat called and american shorthair. It has swirls all over its body. People often confuse this name with domestic shorthair, which is not a pure bred cat. <br>  <br>  My own cat is half domestic shorthair (mutt) and half turkish angora. Even tho he is half angora (his father was a pure bred) he is still a domestic shorthair.|`|9LNtTfmgaa	No, tuxedo is not a breed. Nowhere online should it be listed as one. Tuxedo is simply the coat pattern, like tabby or calico.  Breed would be Maine Coon, Siamese, etc.  Your cat is a "domestic shorthair" (mutt) Only cats from breeders are purebreeds.|`|STumBiU0aa	no its just a a fur pattern|`|NGmRMqe6aa	No it is a coloring like tabby or striped or calico.

GEfUTyi8aa	I would buy a bigger tank... at least five gallons, preferably ten.  There is a misconception about bettas liking small tanks.... its a lie.  They are like any other fish, like room.... and if your going to have other fish, for sure a larger tank..... you cant put another fish in with a betta in a tiny little tank like that.. someone will die.<br>  <br>  I use spring water and feed my bettas flakes... and bloodworms occasionally..... it constipates them and screws up their swim bladder if you feed them just worms..... they like their tank aerated, even though they are built to go to the top of the tank, I still believe they like moving water....rather than still stagnant water.....  <br>  <br>  Bettas are smart fish, if taken care of proper they can live awhile.... they say two to three years but I know a fella whose betta lived to be eight.... he babied that fish to no end.<br>  <br>  Bettas are not ornaments like some stores will tell you.... it makes me sick to see people put them in flower vases with plants.... thats just not right..... they are just like any other fish... need clean balance ph water, a filter system, a temp of 80 and a good diet.... and they really could care less if they have buddies..... in a larger tank with some places to hide they do okay.... but dont worry about them being alone, they prefer it.|`|atrObg5saa	in a ten galleon or so Betta's are fine with non aggressive community fish never put to male Betta's in the same tank a female is fine with a male Betta if there is enough room in tank followed with non aggressive community fish.|`|yczbg2pKaa	that (container)  is to small  get a 5 gallon bare bottom  with a little decoration and that is perfect  you could get him a snail so he can look at it and run in to it and the snail will be ok|`|CuGT5X6eaa	they need at LEAST a gallon to themselves,and its best with a heater and filter,the heat is best between 75-86 F I believe...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ultimatebettas.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimatebettas.com/</a> (this is an AMAZING site)|`|Yztrofywaa	Betas are usually solitary fish. They can be very aggressive especially the males. You should get him a bigger place to live. possibly a big bowl or a 2 gallon hex. In my experience food was never an issue. No need for purifiers, just do water changes every couple of days.|`|AA11708471	Is it one of these <a href="http://i2.iofferphoto.com/img/item/720/246/21/9TWMFqSPvPac4MP.jpg?" rel="nofollow">http://i2.iofferphoto.com/img/item/720/2...</a><br>  If so no wonder your other ones died. Bettas need 5+ gallon heated and filtered aquarium. You need to do proper research when you buy living things. In a 10 gallon heated and filtered aquarium you could have a betta with 6 neon tetras (or other non nippy small tetras).<br>  <br>  Edit: They cant have been healthy.

They also have natural filtration and are in a tropical country.|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	Your tank is unsuitable for any fish. <br>   Bettas need at least 2.5 gallons and a heater set between 75-82 degrees since they are tropical fish. <br>  <br>  Since he is a baby if he doesn't eat cut the pellets in to smaller pieces.
AleWgjvPaa	My cat has the same thing, it's a good thing you're taking him to the vet though because it might be feline flu or snuffles (and it's not contagious to us). <br>  <br>  Until then just take some warm water and a piece of clean cotton (I used a tissue) and dampen the cotton and gently wipe the eye but be careful about not pushing any of the discharge back into his eye. Good luck!|`|NY4ahjfaaa	Keep washing your hands in the meantime. Very contagious.
