tOCESHLYaa	As you probably already know windows defrag is not a good program. Why windows can not put a good defrag program on any of their OS is something I've never been able to figure out. Moving your defragmented files to the beginning of the disk sounds like a great idea. I've done that and the improvement was not much at all if any. The other thing is moving the files to the front could block off your hard drive if they are placed wrong. This will never be a problem, in less you go to partition your hard drive. Then you could find that you won't be able to do it. It does not happen all the time but it does happen. It was a job finding a tool that would set up my hard drive so I could partition it for Windows 7. You should have no problem using two defrag programs.|`|bLuFKxQNaa	It may not be a good idea to defragment with two different defrag programs. My choice for a defragger would be Diskeeper09.

I much prefer Diskeeper 2009 for defrag, and I use the Pro version on all my systems. It does a fantastic job, and runs automatically in the background using only idle system resources.<br>  <a href="http://www.diskeeper.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.diskeeper.com</a><br>  <br>  It's not free, but you can d/l free trial versions from the site and run for 30 days, so make use of it.<br>  <br>  If your drives are heavily fragmented, I think your system files are also fragmented, and free defraggers cannot defrag those.<br>  <br>  Also, to make things easier, run CHKDSK /r once followed by a Disk cleanup to delete useless/temporary files.|`|HOq5Urn1aa	This are 2 of the best defrag programs for you.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.download.com/Auslogics-Disk-Defrag/3000-2094_4-10567503.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/Auslogics-Disk-D...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/iobit-smartdefrag/iobitsmartdefrag.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/iobit-s...</a><br>  <br>  You can either install both or one of them.

2RQ4qDhXaa	Apple Factory RAM does not have the Apple logo on it - the RAM production is done by a 3rd party, but always to Apple's specifications.

The RAM apples uses is kinda crappy( I know people will attack me and say it's not, but it is). Apple uses the slowest possible RAM they can(667Mhz DDR2, and 1066Mhz DDR3), with the highest latencies(6 for DDR2, and 9 for DRR3), at least that is what they are on my friends MacBook. Bestbuy really has no reason to. Plus, the all aluminum ones can't be taken apart that easily(I think) since they are all one piece of metal.

VxZl2hTcaa	You'll need to do it in two steps.  First, use the Free Select (lasso) tool to select the larger area (the outside of the donut).  Then, while holding down Ctrl, select the smaller area that you want to remove from the selection (the hole of the donut).<br>  <br>  Holding down Ctrl while you use a selection tool is a shortcut for changing the "Mode" to "Subtract from the current selection" (you should see the Mode option in the Tool Options dialog when you have a selection tool active).  So instead of holding Ctrl, you could just press the button to change the Mode first, but you'll probably want to change back to "Replace the current selection" when you're done.<br>  <br>  Note: this works with any selection tool, not just the Free Select tool.

3gcaaD0baa	Your computer has what is called an IP address, which in many aspects is just like your house address. When you put a younger age in their data base tracked your computers IP address, so adding a new user account will not help. The law requires for a minor to be at least the age of 13 yrs old (I don't know Facebook's age limit, because that can be changed). I think the easiest thing for you to do is to go to another computer and sign up to Facebook (it won't block you, on that computer, unless you put the restricted age limit in), then after you go through signing up you can access Facebook on your computer.|`|LJ0fRcMGaa	how about going to ur control panel and adding a new user to ur computer that is the right age..then go to facebook..try that!|`|j0vzh6KUaa	this might be a bit of a hassle, but maybe you should terminate that account and just start all over again. create a new account and say you're over 16 or 18...i can't remember which one is the "old enough so they dont give you limits" age. <br>  good luck!<br>  ~caddie

JUC8E03taa	Transferring to another computer is relatively easy. You just need a way to transfer the songs - something like an external hard drive or a flash drive or you can burn CDs. If you plan on burning CDs to transfer the files, I'd advise burning the music files directly to the disc instead of burning an audio CD through iTunes to conserve resources. <br>  <br>  Then you need to determine where your music is stored on your computer. Unless you specified otherwise, the music files should be stored in the default location that iTunes uses which is a folder called iTunes Music within a folder called iTunes within your Music folder. <br>  <br>  Using the "Computer" option on what used to be called the "Start" menu you will add the music files to whatever media you are using to transfer the music. I'm guessing you want to keep the music on your vista machine and just put a copy on your xp machine - to do this you'll want to copy the music (right click on an item, a menu will pop up, select copy) versus moving the actual. Once you have copied something, right click on your flash drive or whatever you are using and select paste from the menu.<br>  <br>  Then just put the media into your xp machine and move the files onto that computer. Once the files are saved to that computer (you can put them wherever you want) you just need to make iTunes recognize it. Under the "File" menu in iTunes there are options to import songs by file (one at a time) or by folder (whole folder at once). <br>  <br>  If any of your music was purchased from the iTunes store, you will need to authorize the xp machine to play the music. You will find an option to authorize under the "Store" menu in iTunes.|`|RyQtWD91aa	What I did was go out and buy a really big flash drive, and then drag all the songs onto the flashdrive from itunes, you can quickly select all by holding down shift and pressing the down button. After this, put the flashdrive in your new computer and drag all the songs into itunes. some of the purchased songs may require a password.|`|TB98SM0yaa	I would burn them as an audio cd then convert them to mp3 on the xp Itunes. it's going to be a pain if you have hundreds of songs though.

KFVaZSfqaa	That is called the “blue screen of death”.  And anyone who has had to deal with them knows why it has that name.  It can be a quite a pain in the neck.  The blue screen is caused by errors in your Windows registry.  Because Windows does not have an internal tool to fix these, it will simply lock up and give you a blue screen when they occur.  What you need to do is scan the registry for problems and fix them.

If you plug in headphones, do you still get the buzz?

If you only get buzz over your speakers, you may have a problem with just the speakers.<br>  <br>  If it wasn't an as-is floor model sale I'd take it back into BestBuy and see if they can fix it.

sv64Uy3Saa	Low wattage cards do not need additional power source. However, the 9600GT draws considerable power that is why it has got that 6-pin PCIe power connector. And it would usually come bundled with the 6-pin to dual 4-pin molex adapter in case your power supply is a typical OEM type with no 6-pin PCIe connector.<br>  <br>  Just connect a PCIe power connector to that card and it should turn on.

awA7naBoaa	If you buy a new motherboard you could upgrade.|`|g7M1DxFCaa	As it's a socket 478 board you have the top processor for it already (well almost, there's a 3.4GHz P4 but why bother buying a new chip to only gain 200MHz).  After that Intel produced the LGA775 boards, which take everything from a Pentium D/Celeron D, via the Core2Duo up to a Core2Quad Q6950.  After this, the new chips, Intel i7 series have a different system again, they use the new LGA1366 based boards, a different socket again.  Motherboards are cheap though, it's the processors that are the pricey bit.  Alternatively you could use AMD processors and suitable boards.  AMD are cheaper but if I were you I'd wait for them to release a new chip before buying, many feel that the Core2Quad6600 is superior to the quad core Phenom chips, and fairly inexpensive too.  Whichever path you choose, you'll need new memory as well as these chips will expect faster DDR2 memory at the least, you may have DDR, not DDR2 in your machine.  A single core of a Core2 chip does about twice the work of a single Pentium 4 core due to differences in architecture, theoretically a Q6600 at 2.4GHz can do up to eight times the work of a Pentium4 (single core) at the same speed, plus it responds well to overclocking (mine runs quite happily without overheating or extra voltage at 3.15GHz)|`|q7MIcWBBaa	yea you'd have to upgrade your MoBo and CPU at the same time .. and probably even your RAM .. P4's are larger than today's dual core processors (130nm or 90nm P4's vs. 65nm and 45nm C2D's) .. AMD is the only chip maker i've seen release new 90nm processors .. and an AMD processor won't fit in your board!!<br>  <br>  according to ASRock's site .. it supports the Northwood and Prescott versions of the P4 (my P4 extreme edition is a Prescott and it's a 90nm processor) .. and the Celeron .. all being 90nm processors .. <br>  <br>  so looks like you'll definitely need to upgrade your MoBo, RAM (70% probability) and CPU .. <br>  <br>  more about RAM - my P4 board supports DDR2 PC5400 I believe so you MAY not have to upgrade your RAM .. if you don't want to go as far as replacing your RAM just make sure your new board supports the RAM you currently havE!|`|a0JFg5tDaa	As Nathan said, the only way you're getting a dual core is with a new motherboard. Depending on the kind of processor you want, you may need new RAM and a new graphics card as well (assuming you had a dedicated card in the first place).

YzEbRBCzaa	Well obviously you are actually doubling your speed now.  As for wireless you will never be able to get the full speed as promised.  If you use to have 5mbps then with wireless its probably around 3.5mbps.  When you are going up to 10 you will probably get 7-8mbps.<br>  <br>  If you are direct connected by a cable then you will pretty much get the full speed.  Fiber Optics is the best you can get for a home.  Hopefully you got it from a cable company familiar with fiber optics like Time Warner Cable.  They have been using it for over 10 years now and the new stuff that ATT Uverse, Verizon FIOS, they are still new with it and there will be several bugs until they have more experience with it.<br>  <br>  You should be okay and the internet speed will be great and reliable.  Im still using DSL but it works for me, heh.|`|9lBe1JGAaa	Well wireless severely limits your connection speeds. <br>  <br>  I don't understand why you would fork out all that extra cash for a fiber optic line if you are just going to ruin it with wireless internet. <br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry I realized that i didn't answer your question. <br>  <br>  You probably wont notice a difference over wireless, but you might. It could be slightly faster, or exactly the same if 5mbps was your max. wireless speed. Depends on your hardware and how much money you invested in a wireless router.

So when you draw the first line, you need to draw the top line of the first triangle, the bottom of 2 other triangles and then the top of the forth triangle.  Only then should you try drawing the next line.  This should be easily accomplished with just one more loop.

You can get cases just about anywhere - if you want a really good one check out NewEgg.Com or Amazon, but if you only want to see if that drive if toast you can pick up a cheap one at RadioShack for like $20-30. You can even get a case-less cord: one end plugs into a USB or FireWire port and the other hooks right to the un-cased hard drive. I saw a couple of those at NewEgg and ThinkGeek.Com.<br>  <br>  Clicking is never a good sound though - if your hard drive itself is dead, you may have to use some data recovery software or, worst case scenario, take it to a computer data recovery service. Those can be a little expensive, but worth it if you can't afford to loose that data.<br>  <br>  I have lost hard drives before, and now I have a multi-hard drive back up system where all my data is backed up on three seperate HDD,s as well as off-site (I use Google's data backup service because it's really cheap).<br>  <br>  Good luck!

6b44794b7b7a38aee0468ee77d56514daa	To become a game programmer, you first need to become a programmer.<br>  <br>  You need to learn algorithms and data structures. Algorithms are the set of steps required to do a particular thing, while data structures are how you organize the data inside your program.<br>  <br>  You need to learn things like defining a data structure from atomic elements like integers, floating point numbers, characters, arrays and pointers; defining a function, its parameters, the code inside it, how to return values, and how to call the function; control structures like conditional statements and loops.<br>  <br>  You will also need to learn how to accept input from the user and deliver output. You start by learning how to accept input from the keyboard and deliver output to the screen in a console program; then you move on to learn how to read and write from a file, etc.<br>  <br>  You may also need to learn object-oriented programming (that's it, knowing that a class is a set of methods and properties, that methods are functions that have access to the properties of the class, that you can create objects that are instances of classes, that you can create derived classes, that you can destroy objects, etc).<br>  <br>  Oh, and you will need to learn a programming language. I advocate against learning to program a particular programming language without learning the basic programming concepts first. Once you learn how to PROGRAM, you can quickly learn how to program in C, in C++, in Java, in Python, etc...<br>  <br>  And that's just so you can get started in programming. Once you're done, then there's a lot of game-related concepts you will need to learn. Here are just a few:<br>  <br>  - Drawing graphics in a screen. How to initialize a graphics window, how to draw primitive figures like a point, a line, an image you loaded from a file, to fill in a region, etc.<br>  - Polling for events, coming from the keyboard, the mouse, a timer, file i/o, etc.<br>  - Most game programs consist of a big main loop that gets executed N times each second. Each time, the loop will need to handle all aspects of the game, so you'll need to define functions for:<br>  --- Updating the screen with the game elements: background, scores, sprites (the moving objects, players, enemies...), etc.<br>  --- Polling for events and interpreting them.<br>  --- Moving things around. For example, one of your enemies will move in a particular way, and you update the enemy's position at this step.<br>  --- Checking for game-related conditions. Like, say, collisions between a player and an enemy.<br>  --- Checking whether the game can continue or not.<br>  --- etc.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.libsdl.org/index.php</a> is a library that's easy to use, and that is widely used to program games. There are many examples with source code you may want to visit, once you get started with programming. There are bindings for many languages, but most game programmers will write in C/C++.<br>  <br>  Oh, and good programmers don't go to learn to program to a school; they get a book about programming and/or research on the 'net, and start learning on their own.

So you bought a new drive.  That works.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to shell out a little cash (about $30), there's a great application called Ghost (made by Symantec) that can take a "picture" (what they call an "image") of your present hard drive and you can transfer that to your new drive.  The application is a little technical, but if you read the manual and hit the Net for some advice (just Google something like "using Ghost images", you can get some good background before you do it for real.<br>  <br>  There are also other applications (such as Acronis True Image Home 10) out there that do the same thing, but I know Ghost more than any other.  Try going to www.downloads.com and enter something along the lines of "backup software" or "restore software" and go through the results.  There may be a much easier-to-use app out there.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

20cfad276d2f2f74d4d5633616985126aa	Vista, the new OS from Microsoft, is supposed to represent 50 million lines of code done in C++. C++ is the fastest language we've got before having to use machine-code, such as Assembler. The short-coming of C++ is it doesn't come with "widgets" -- the buttons, scrolling lists, menus and that sort of thing, whereas a similar language called Java does. The problem with C++ is there is no standardization. Picking up someone else's ideas can be very time-consuming trying to adapt to your project. C++ is fast. There are several C++ packages that come with the widgets. Check out the link below for QT-C++. They have a download for free academic use. You may have to get someone to help you "make" the downloaded code. That's the thing, whatever you code in C++ has to be re-compiled ("make") on every different type of computer out there. The code you write for a Mac will NOT run automagically on a PC or a Linux box.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn programming, pick up something like java. Java can be coded for a cellphone or a mainframe computer. If you have Linux, pick up Python.|`|AA12370760	C++ is a general-purpose, high-level programming language with low-level facilities. It is a statically typed free-form multi-paradigm language supporting procedural programming, data abstraction, object-oriented programming, generic programming and RTTI. Since the 1990s, C++ has been one of the most popular commercial programming languages.<br>  <br>  Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ (originally named "C with Classes") in 1983 at Bell Labs as an enhancement to the C programming language. Enhancements started with the addition of classes, followed by, among other features, virtual functions, operator overloading, multiple inheritance, templates, and exception handling. The C++ programming language standard was ratified in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, the current version of which is the 2003 version, ISO/IEC 14882:2003. A new version of the standard (known informally as C++0x) is being developed.|`|3b79f49b0ba5db95356ea6c9d23f596caa	the second part of your question is more than can be done in this context without a reference to websites.... so just google.com or even search off yahoo for c++ programing.<br>  <br>  it is a very early program language..... basic idea of what it does??? it enables humans to use machines in a more effective way.|`|AA12354851	C++ is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language that is viewed by many as the best language for creating large-scale applications. C++ is a superset of the C language. A related programming language, Java, is based on C++ but optimized for the distribution of program objects in a network such as the Internet. Java is somewhat simpler and easier to learn than C++ and has characteristics that give it other advantages over C++. However, both languages require a considerable amount of study.

6V88KqxTaa	250 kbps is not enough for 50 computers specially if they browse the internet at the same time. This means your reserving about 0.5Kb/s to each computer. if you try to view a web page about 100Kb heavy then it would take about 3 minutes just to view that page. The problem is the bandwidth is never distributed evenly that way so chances are some of the computers will not be able to load a web page. Something around 1.5 Mbps will suffice.

Directly under the area where you set the color that you're using, there are two little buttons next to eachother. They are both circles inside of rectangles. Click on the button that has the shaded in rectangle (the button with the white rectangle should be activated when you open photoshop). Select the paintbrush tool and change the color to black. Make sure that the brush is set to 100% hardness. Now just paint the background area (notice that the piant turns out red, not black). If you mess up, change your paint color to white and paint over the part that you don't want selected. The selection works on whatever isn't painted black (or any shade of gray really). A neat way to see what this tool does is to activate it and do a black to white gradient across your picture. Then switch it off again by clickin on the other 'circle in a rectangle' button, which changes what you didn't paint into a selection and hit the delete button. You'll see that the darker you paint with the black, the 'more' that section is selected (if you see what I mean). So, once the entire background is painted, deactivate the tool. All that you didn't paint is now selected. Just copy and paste onto any background that you'd like and you're set. I hope that you can make sense of this.... It's really hard to explain without showing you exactly what I mean. Good luck.

Also, do a thorough cleanup of your system before you try installing pack 2. Another thing that you could do before installing Pack 2, is to download the free trial of Tuneup Utilities and use that program to clean up your registry. The program is very good and it is safe when you let it do the job automatically. just be careful not to get in your registry and do any changes yourself. If those things don't work, you may need to use your original Windows CD to reinstall windows but only the parts tat are missing.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|35efa768e44f02eb3ef526e50bee4ce0aa	If your pc is infected it will not instal SP2|`|0aff296c901a6a4a843b727a7140d6a2aa	You need to fix some original system files first before installing SP2.

f96955840ec1263ed450c028d4f63938aa	There is a provision for password in BIOS. During your computer startup you have to press del key (sometimes a function key- vary on system to system) to enter into BIOS configuration, there you can opt for a password for system startup.

To get to the BIOS, Hold down the DEL key when powering up (or perhaps the f1 or f2 key, depending upon what computer you have)<br>  <br>  Stay away from third party boot modifiers that can ask for a password and then switch control to boot your operating system. These get infected easily and also interfere with program updates.|`|278e6149ba72ff1651777466a84d1e07aa	Tell me the secret password and I will give you the answer! Enough protection for you?
54eb668a7249694b0b9c18370ec81abeaa	I have ordered from both, and have never had a problem with either.  I have more experience with Ebay though.  Most sellers are dependent on the feedback score and you can discuss any problems with them.  My worst experience has been one seller who shipped slow,and did not communicate well, but I eventually received the item as described.<br>  However, I am very careful about the people/companies that I purchase from.  I always read feedback first.  I never leave feedback until I receive item.  Always read the description carefully.  I never mail personal checks, never wire transfer.  I always use pay pall, and my own disposable e-mail address (so if I get spam I just delete the address), and I never answer "second chance offers", or any request to purchase outside of the website (via e-mail).  I never answer any e-mails or click on any links that come to my personal e-mail.  I always go through e-bay even to pay for the item vs. paying via electronic e-mailed pay pal invoice.  I never answer any e-mail saying it is from pay pall I have received spoofs/ phishing e-mails (posed as pay pall e-mails).  I monitor my pay pall account and CC account closely.  Also I would make sure you use an account that has good fraud protection.  Just use your common sense, practice buyer beware, and other Internet safety tips.  Yahoo has a lot of good reference material on the subject, and Pay pall also sends out security information.  I hope this helps.|`|ab56668d0a7c7f310134277ec98f9488aa	I love Amazon, I have never had a problem. You go through a secure sight to give credit card info.

Now burn the DVD. This will run perfectly on any DVD Player.<br>  <br>  One more important thing, if the size of your video_ts directory is more than 4.38 GB you have to use a dual layer DVD, which supports upto 7.9 GB.<br>  <br>  Nero can be downloaded from<br>  <a href="http://ww2.nero.com/enu/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://ww2.nero.com/enu/index.html</a>

1f1baef5a7d99e3b70a80dcd5c4f7e5faa	It depends on the CPU and whatever that CPU's threshold is. Most are set to around 70 -85 deg C. The setting as far as when the machine shuts down when a certain temperature is reached, may be able to be changed or set in the BIOS or with a third party software.<br>  <br>  If you have a CPU that is overheating, the fan that is over the metal heatsink is probably dusty and dirty. It needs to be removed and cleaned with some compressed air. Clean the metal hetasink too. Make sure if you use water on the metal heat sink that it is completely dry before you put it back over the CPU. If cleaning the fan and heat sink don't do the job, the fan may need to be replaced. Try a known good fan first before you go and by one. It may be a systemboard problem that doesn't allow the fan to rotate fast enough, or the fan is bad, or the power supply is not giving the fan enough power, so the power supply may need to be replaced, try a knonw good power supply before buying a new one.

2f7a0db4eff37c85e213ba66d2fc4f7daa	Here is your answer:<br>  <br>   Googler insights into product and technology news and our culture.<br>  <br>  Googlebombing 'failure'<br>  9/16/2005 12:54:00 PM<br>  <br>  Posted by Marissa Mayer, Director of Consumer Web Products<br>  <br>  If you do a Google search on the word [failure] or the phrase [miserable failure], the top result is currently the White House’s official biographical page for President Bush. We've received some complaints recently from users who assume that this reflects a political bias on our part. I'd like to explain how these results come up in order to allay these concerns.<br>  <br>  Google's search results are generated by computer programs that rank web pages in large part by examining the number and relative popularity of the sites that link to them. By using a practice called googlebombing, however, determined pranksters can occasionally produce odd results. In this case, a number of webmasters use the phrases [failure] and [miserable failure] to describe and link to President Bush's website, thus pushing it to the top of searches for those phrases. We don't condone the practice of googlebombing, or any other action that seeks to affect the integrity of our search results, but we're also reluctant to alter our results by hand in order to prevent such items from showing up. Pranks like this may be distracting to some, but they don't affect the overall quality of our search service, whose objectivity, as always, remains the core of our mission.|`|216770b26d89095522f396b0a5cadbb5aa	It deplicts what exactly the whitehouse is as our govt.|`|e8ad3ed7cb80d4a5d45e3efed91a4423aa	No idea, but it's the funniest thing I've ever seen!|`|0003934bb4332a9e445607b7d52efbdeaa	I agree that is the funniest thing I think I've ever seen!

AA10248855	Greetings well, for that money, you are not going to get new. <br>  <br>  i would suggest that you check out eBay , sorry, i know you said you don't like auction sites, but that is where you will find the best selection<br>  <br>  read the descriptions carefully, and contact the seller and ask them questions.  I recently purchased a good laptop for under $200 it was not new nor did it have a lot of extras, but it functions well and does the job.<br>  <br>  before you actually buy anywhere, you need to determine exactly what you need in a machine.  If you are going to use it for word processing and spreadsheets, some net surfing, school work, light stuff like that, you will not need much of a machine.  I<br>   would look for at the very LEAST:<br>   a CPU of 500+Mhz; <br>  96Mb of Ram; <br>  8Gb Hard Drive; and a <br>  USB Port.  <br>  All laptops come with PCMCIA slot for adapter cards and the USB Port is very very very handy because so much can be connected to it. I like laptops with swappable (multibay) drives,  you can change from floppy to cd to zip to cdrw to dvd, the multibay is really versatile.  If possible you would want at least Win2kPro for an O/S , WinXP is nice but it takes more umph to run it and on a limited platform it has a bit much overhead and Win2kPro does  a very good job.<br>  <br>  hope that helps you|`|0168c0b3ff9508d761c7dbb747ac712aaa	You can buy a good compaq presario on ebay for that.

I'm not sure what happens, but this often causes a lot of disk activity on my computer, which holds up other processes.  Quite a lot of commercial software now loads up these background processes, which are unused for most of the time and they can be removed. I suggest that you use task manager just to see how many processes you have running in the background and get a friend to advise on which ones can be removed. (Quite a number are essential to the operation of your computer, so you cannot remove them.)

Youtube didn't just appear as several applications pasted together.  <br>  <br>  There was integration of scraps of programs plugged into running scripts.  <br>  <br>  I suggest you hire some programmers who can integrate video, multimedia, sound, audio codecs, in all the various formats.  <br>  <br>  Start with a budget, and a plan.  Two servers?  They best be Linux or BSD servers!  By the sixth month, you would need 100, if any good, so, do you have a plan for expansion?  <br>  <br>   Microsoft failed in the server business because IIS can't handle the network load, won't balance, and needs to be behind Linux servers for protection from syn floods and takedowns!  Plus, a single Linux or BSD server replaces the functions of a dozen Microsoft servers, plus two to three full time technicians.<br>  <br>  Look at Hotmail and Yahoo, both run BSD servers.  Microsoft and MSN run behind Akamai Leased Linux servers, about 15,000 of them for each domain.  Google runs 100,000 Linux servers, in clusters. <br>  <br>  I would cluster (a Beowulf) to handle the workload.  In fact, you should read and study all about them.  <a href="http://google.com/linux" rel="nofollow">http://google.com/linux</a> and search for 'cluster' and 'Beowulf', and klaat2 (University of Kentucky Beowulf cluster).<br>  <br>  I run <a href="http://pclinuxos.com" rel="nofollow">http://pclinuxos.com</a> on this machine and am asssembling my 16 node Beowulf Cluster using KnoppixCluster that boots PXEII. (Pre-existing Ethernet) from a single gateway master server.   <br>  <br>  Like google when they started, no cases, just mainboards and PSUs in frames assembled out of cheap PVC plumbing pipes.<br>   <br>  Now, there are Googel conex containers that are entire Google cluster server 'stations' for third world nations...  <br>  Youtube is NOT going to give out the secret sauce recipe!|`|0aRTae6eaa	how much profit do we get if we tell u? specify that in ur question|`|7f9e9eda3b84f6428db91d7f37d5b7b0aa	www.elance.com<br>  <br>  Submit your project and tons of programmers will bid on doing your project and submit a price for a deal.

Unlike the other Registry files, this one is stored in your personal Documents and Settings folder and contains the entire contents of the HKEY_LOCAL_USER branch of the Registry. You can’t delete it because it’s in use and protected, and you wouldn’t want to because otherwise you’ll mess up your whole computer! It will grow as you install more software that creates keys and sub keys in this branch of the Registry, and so is perfectly normal. To summarise: leave NTUSER.DAT alone.<br>  <br>  According to microsoft<br>  The user profile registry hive is the NTuser.dat in file form, and is mapped to the HKEY_CURRENT_USER portion of the registry when the user logs on. The NTuser.dat hive maintains the users environment preferences when the user is logged on. It stores those settings that maintain network connections, Control Panel configurations unique to the user (such as the desktop color and mouse), and application-specific settings.

It's really not that hard, and if you learn it first, and then go to a WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) editor, you will know what's going on and how to tweak it just how you like.  If you start with the editor and then move to HTML, things will be much more confusing.<br>  <br>  You can make a web page and view it without having to have a host.  Learn the HTML and practice.  View the pages you are making on your computer, not online.  Get familiar with how pages are put together.<br>  <br>  Now, come up with what you want your website to be about.  Some basic planning is necessary, more if the site is going to be complex.  Come up with a name, a look, and how your content is going to be organized.<br>  <br>  Now, create.  Simple enough, just make the pages that make up the site.  Link them together and see how they work.  Tweek and fix until you get it the way you want it.<br>  <br>  Next, you have to find a place to host your site.  This can be a free hosting service, or you can buy one.  If it is your first site, I would suggest a free one, that way you can mess up and learn and try stuff without having to waste money.  Try a web search and you'll see that there's plenty of free places.<br>  <br>  Now upload your pages and images and everything else that goes with your site.  Test out the online version and make sure everything works.  And I do mean everything.  It's a bit embarassing to skimp a bit on the checking, and then later have someone else point out to you that something isn't working.<br>  <br>  Now that that's done, you have a website!<br>  <br>  (Yes, I know that was a bit long winded.  Webpage making really isn't as hard as most people think it is.  A lot of it is common sense and practice.)<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|PvuJDkg5aa	Well to start with, you will need a website name ie:   www.*****.***<br>  Then you will need some place to host it. Like a yahoo or godaddy or there are even some free hosting services out there also.<br>  Then, if you have never done this before, you should get some software, probably WYSIWYG. You could do a trial of Dreamweaver or Web Expression.<br>  Just start really simple to experiment. Also, you can get the trial software prior to the 1st 2 steps just so you learn web design first. Both of these programs will allow you to view your website(running on your computer) prior to publishing your site.|`|f8ce1ccac04ee33a57ac51a244e10a49aa	there are tons of ways.  read online how to make simple html files, and use  GUI, graphical user interface to do that, like Dreamweaver by Macromedia (Adobe now).  download the 30 day trial of dreamweaver for windows or mac.<br>  <br>  organize your website into 5 or so categories, and then make a webpage for each.  learn to hyperlink those pages together with "link" in any program for webmaking etc.<br>  <br>  remember what people want to see, what you want to show to them, and then cut out what is too much.<br>  <br>  also, remember to make images on the page fit, so dont build an image, use an image, larger than say, 600 pixels wide and 400 pixels high. most screens have 1024 pixels wide and 768 pixels high. get it? picture smaller than screen. rug smaller than room.<br>  <br>  enjoy<br>  <br>  www.adobe.com macromedia(adobe) dreamweaver|`|e49cde750044a8317faf2fe2f8f2d69baa	Fight a spider web..<br>  <br>  You get it, "web sight(ing)"<br>  <br>  Ha Ha!

AA11638388	Using any computer attatched to your BT Home Hub (wired or wireless), go into internet explorer and type 192.168.1.1 into the address bar. Look through the pages you get until you find Wireless or Security or something similar. You now have to set up a WPA-PSK - the reason I say this is that WEP is unsecure and can very easily be cracked. Next, you must come up with a WPA key - the best way to do this is to go to <a href="https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm" rel="nofollow">https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm</a> which will generate perfectly secure pseudo-random keys which will be unique to you. Simply click the link, then copy and paste the key given under the heading of "63 random printable ASCII characters" (the middle one). Paste this key into Word or Notepad and print out a couple of copies, and don't lose them.<br>  <br>  Go back to your Wireless Security settings page on you BT Home Hub - after selecting WPA (or WPA-PSK) then paste the key into it. Apply and save the settings (there will probably be a button on the settings page that says "Apply".) As soon as you do this, any PC connected wirelessly to the hub will lose its connection. Don't panic, this is supposed to happen.<br>  <br>  Next you have to set up your PC(s) to connect to the hub again, so - assuming Windows XP - goto Start>Connect to>Show all connections. Find the icon representing the wireless connection, right click it and choose "View Available Wireless Networks". On the pane to the left of the window that appears, choose "Change advanced settings." In the window that appears, choose the "Wireless Networks" tab. Half way down the window, in the "Preferred Networks" frame, find your Hub in the white box. Click on it and hit the properties button. Now in the new window that appears, choose "WPA-PSK" for the Network Authentication. Then paste your key into the "Network Key" and "Confirm Network Key" text boxes. Hit OK. Then hit OK on the "Wireless Network Connection Properties" window. Back in the "Network Connections" window (which you brought up from the Start menu), again right click the wireless network and click "View Available Wireless Networks". Find your BT Wireless Hub in the window that appears and make sure the status is "Connected". If it isn't then click "Connect". You will need to do this for all PCs you want to connect to the hub, but you must only setup the Hub once (that is the page you brought up with 192.168.1.1). And you must use the same WPA key you printed out earlier on all PCs.<br>  <br>  This should get your wireless connection secured, but remember that it is only secure if you know exactly what you are doing. I highly reccomend you download and listen to "Security Now! Podcast", which you can subscribe to via the Apple Music Store for FREE or download for FREE from <a href="http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm." rel="nofollow">http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm.</a> It is only a suggestion, but it would greatly increase your knowledge on security and therefore increase your security. Just a friendly suggestion.<br>  <br>  I also recommend that if you choose to use my answer that you print it out before you start because you will temporarily lose your connection when securing it.|`|8vJFQUz8aa	It is telling you that your wireless router is unsecured.

DOQFLk6Faa	I have been making money on internet for 4 years and I was personally scammed by a good many making money methods.Finally,I found the most legitimate, effective and fast way for beginner to make money is doing paid surveys if you have a computer with Internet access and can sit at your computer for 1.5-3 hours per day.<br>  <br>  But before joining a paid survey network, you should be sure that the paid survey company satisfies the following minimum requirements: <br>  1. In business for at least 1 year. <br>  2. Well organized, easy to navigate directories. <br>  3. Directories updated at least weekly. <br>  4. Helpful resources available for newcomers. <br>  5.

It takes work and knowledge. And then you have to strategically implement the knowledge you gain. You have to advertise and spend money to be able to make money online.<br>  <br>  If you are willing to learn and you have the time to put into this you will be able to make alot of money online. If you are not willing to learn, then my advice is stay away from anything that suggest you can make money without lifting a finger. <br>  <br>  Are there genuine ways to make money online, yes. But like I said you have to be willing to learn. On this site, <br>  <a href="http://successmentor.3stepsecret.com" rel="nofollow">http://successmentor.3stepsecret.com</a> ,you learn how to build a successful business online. If the knowledge you gain for free is something you feel you can implement, then go ahead <br>  and follow their recommendation. It works if you implement it and it won't work if you don't implement it. Many people come online without understanding that these guys have made lots of money selling their info products and they come out with more and more. I bought into many programs when I got started back in 2001. Only to discover that I had to learn how to promote,  promote and promote online. No system will work without promotion.<br>  <br>  If you desire to make money the old way, offline, anyone can do this. But you have to set this up as a back up plan. If you need $1000 to $5000 within any 30 days, here is a plan you<br>  can follow:<br>  <br>   (1) SMALL INVESTMENT -- $10 or less.<br>  <br>  (2) MAXIMUM RETURN -- $1,000 - $5,000 in 30 days.<br>  <br>  (3) NO SELLING.<br>  <br>  (4) IMMEDIATE POSSIBILITIES -- starting today.<br>  <br>  (5) ANYONE CAN DO IT<br>  <br>  If you want to execute this plan goto:<br>  <a href="http://www.mlmincome.net/FC.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mlmincome.net/FC.html</a>

AA10727709	Hi,<br>  <br>  If you're a total newbie to web design/websites i'd suggest you get an idea of the basics:<br>  <br>  For a website you need:<br>  <br>  1) A design<br>  2) Content<br>  3) Server space to hold your website on<br>  4) A domain name like yourcloth.com or something (this is optional, but ideally if you want a popular website, it's much better to have a domain name than use something like www.freewebs.com/yourcloth<br>  <br>  1) Designing a website can be hard, but it can also be very easy, if you use a site builder. These can be found on websites such as www.geocities.com (which also will give you some free space to hold your website on, however there will be advertisements). <br>  <br>  Alternatively you can use a programme such as Macromedia Dreamweaver, where it does all the coding for you, and you just have to layout how you would like the websites.<br>  <br>  2) Content is up to you, but obviously include pics, contact details... don't make the website too complicated as it often puts people off.<br>  <br>  3) Server space is vital.. you can opt for free places, where you can get say 20MB, however usually they overload your site with advertisements and pop-ups. You can find free space by googling, or going to www.freewebs.com, and there are plenty others.<br>  <br>  If you want your own space, that is advertisement free, then i suggest purchasing some space for a nominal, annual fee... a good place is www.echoechoplus.com and www.echoecho.com has great tutorials on web design as well.<br>  <br>  4) Domain names help, but they aren't crutial.. you can also buy these... simple google "buy domain name" and the rest is history!<br>  <br>  Hope some of this helps!|`|35470b8c7c1390650d7187519a29f8cbaa	You could get a software like deamweaver from www.adobe.com/dreamweaver  it would make it easire for you to build a website.

Pero además GDI te ofrece la posibilidad de ganar dinero extra con ella: por cada persona q entre en tu página y se afilie, te dan 1$ cada mes, así q con 10afiliados tienes el mantenimiento de tu página gratis. <br>  Pero además recibes 1$ por cada persona q tus afiliados den de alta, hasta 5niveles.<br>  Por ej: das de alta a 5, te dan 5$; ellos registran a otros 5cada uno, y te dan 25$; esos a su vez a otros 5 cada uno, ya te dan 125$ más lo anterior; luego 625$, y 3125$. Estas cantidades parecen exageradas, demasiados bueno para ser verdad, pero yo conozco gente q llevan 2a?os en esto, y ganan 2000$ al mes. Además, aunq solo sean 100$ al mes, es un dinero extra q te llevas cada mes.<br>  Quiero aclarar q esto se basa en el marketing multinivel, q a diferencia de los sistemas piramidales, es totalmente legal, ya q sí vendemos un producto real, los dominios.ws, solo podemos recibir comisiones hasta el 5onivel; la solvencia de la empresa se explica facilmente: en vez de quedarse los 10$ q pagamos todos, se queda con 5$, y los otros 5 los reparte entre los 5niveles por encima de nosotros, 1$ para cada persona de cada uno de esos 5niveles. Este sistema es utilizado x muchas compa?ías para hacerse publicidad, como herbalife, x ejemplo, pero con GDI, no tienes q comprar productos no cumplir un mínimo de afiliaciones cada mes, tu vas a tu ritmo. Para aquellos q desconfíen de lo q digo, les animo a q investiguen x su cuenta, sobre GDI y el marketing multinivel, y verán q no encuentran nada en contra.<br>  Otro incentivo q da GDI es q por cada 5personas q afilies en una semana, te dan bonus de 100$.<br>  La forma de pago es muy segura, ya q solo das tu no de tarjeta (VISA o Mastercard), no el de tu cuenta bancaria.<br>  Para recibir los pagos, lo puedes hacer x checkmail, transferencia bancaria o x paypal (lo más recomendable).<br>  La primera semana es de prueba, gratuita, y si no te convence te puedes dar de baja.<br>  Si aún hay desconfianza sobre la fiabilidad de la empresa, tengo pruebas de que pagan, con el email de paypal, diciendo q GDI me ha pagado los 100$ del bonus, y el recibo del banco de que me ha llegado el dinero.<br>  Para aquellos q no tienen mucha idea de dise?o de páginas web, y q no quieran complicarse la vida, se les proporciona una plantilla como la di mi página, y solo hay q cambiar los datos, así como los programas para hacerla y subirla (esto es gratis, y está aprobado x GDI).<br>  Si te interesa o tienes alguna duda contacta conmigo:<br>  danielamoralesaguilar@hotmail....<br>  danielamoralesaguilar@yahoo.es|`|8eP897Fwaa	Primero tenés que registrarlo lo antes posible en www.nic.ar. Ahí te indican los pasos a seguir.<br>  <br>  Una vez que te dieron el dominio, tenés que conseguir un hosting (lugar en donde podés albergar a tu página web que se invocará con el nombre que elegiste previamente).<br>  <br>  El dominio es gratuito (si es .com.ar, .com es internacional y se paga) y el hosting para una página web personal no es caro... calculale $10 por mes (hay lugares que cobran más barato y otros más caro, por supuesto).<br>  <br>  Espero que te sirva la info.

514e081dd2f11340b9e0e6696a7dc773aa	My advice would be not to design it in pixels in Photoshop in the first place if you want a flexible percentage based layout, however that won't help you much.<br>  <br>  Dreamweaver has some little buttons for converting widths and heights within tables to percentages.  If you select the top table element (on the status bar at the bottom of the preview pane) you should then see four buttons in the properties dialogue which, when you mouse over them, will display tooltips like 'Convert Table Widths to Percent'.<br>  <br>  Note, however, that the conversion is naive - it just works out what the current width is in terms of your preview size, so if you have a 1024x768 display, you might end up with 900 pixel width preview pane, in which case an 800 pixel fixed width table will be converted to be (800/900)*100 = 88% width.  If you have a higher resolution screen you'll get a lower percentage value.<br>  <br>  If you really want a fluid layout, then your design needs to take that into account from the start, and you'd be better off designing it in Dreamweaver than in Photoshop.  See the links below for an introduction to some of the issues.
7dLiFX0Taa	You need a composite or S-Video jack to connect your PlayStation 2 directly to your computer, but if you don't think your monitor or computer have these connections, try using a VGA converter box.<br>  <br>  These VGA adapters will provide you all the necessary connections so that you can plug in your PS2 to your LCD monitor. It might get a little messy with all the cables, since you will also need to run a VGA (monitor) cable from your computer's video card to the VGA adapter and another cable from the VGA adapter to your monitor. <br>  <br>  Another idea is to use a TV tuner card, but this needs to be installed inside your desktop computer. Laptop owners will need a PCMCIA TV tuner card, but only if they have a PCMCIA slot for it (most laptops do).|`|KEOH5WWSaa	Yes, just get an HDMI to DVI adapter.

fgnb3inUaa	When data travels through a wire it is sent as packets of 0s and 1s.  These 0s and 1s are translated by your computers modem/ethernet card to be displayed on your screen.  When the data is sent through radio waves the 0s and 1s are sent as radio waves.  These radio waves are measured by amplitudes.  The amplitudes are converted into 0s and 1s so the computer can understand what the heck is going on.

egNSsWnvaa	The first url is that of a forum application. You don't just cut and paste code from one site to another in this case. You need a copy of the forum program and it has to be installed on the web server so it can be correctly configured to match your server's settings and customized to meet your requirements. Do you own a license for the forum application? If so, why are you using geocities? Geocities is for people who don't know any better. Pony up for web hosting and pay for the program. The application will have the necessary instructions to get it installed and configured.

La fuente está más abajo. <br>  <br>  <br>  Creación 2.0<br>  <br>  Al principio Dios creó el bit y el byte, y de ellos creó el registro. Y hubo dos bytes en un registro, y nada más existía.<br>  <br>  Y Dios separó el uno del cero, y vio que esto era bueno.<br>  <br>  Y Dios dijo: Hágase el dato. Y así sucedió.<br>  <br>  Y Dios dijo: Que los datos vayan a su correspondiente lugar. Y creó los disquetes, discos duros y los CDs.<br>  <br>  Y dijo Dios: Háganse los ordenadores, así habrá lugar para poner los disquetes, discos duros y CDs. Así Dios creó los ordenadores y los llamó hardware.<br>  <br>  Y no había software aún. Pero Dios creó programas, peque?os y grandes... Y les dijo: Vayan y multiplíquense por sí mismos y llenen toda la memoria.<br>  <br>  Y dijo Dios: Crearé al programador. Y el programador hará nuevos programas y gobernará sobre los ordenadores, programas y datos.<br>  <br>  Y Dios creó al programador y lo puso en el centro de datos.<br>  <br>  Y Dios le mostró al programador el árbol de directorios y le dijo: Puedes usarlo todo, pero NO USES Windows...<br>  <br>  Y Dios dijo: No es bueno para el programador estar solo. Tomó un hueso del cuerpo del programador y creó una criatura que buscaría al programador, lo admiraría y amaría las cosas que hiciera. Y Dios llamó a la criatura el usuario.<br>  <br>  Y el programador y el usuario fueron dejados bajo el DOS desnudo. Y fue bueno.<br>  <br>  Pero Bill fue más listo que todas las otras criaturas de Dios. Y Bill le dijo al usuario: ?Realmente Dios te dijo que no ejecutaras ningún programa?<br>  <br>  Y respondió el usuario: Dios nos dijo que podíamos usar cualquier programa y cualquier dato, pero nos dijo que no ejecutáramos Windows o moriríamos.<br>  <br>  Y Bill dijo al usuario: ?Cómo puedes hablar sobre algo que no has probado? En el momento en que ejecutes Windows serás como Dios. Podrás crear cualquier cosa que desees con un simple clic del ratón.<br>  <br>  Y el usuario vio que los frutos del Windows eran buenos y fáciles de usar.<br>  <br>  Así que el usuario instaló Windows en su ordenador y le dijo al programador que era bueno.<br>  <br>  Y el programador empezó a buscar nuevos drivers. Y Dios le preguntó: ?Qué buscas?<br>  Y el Programador respondió: Busco nuevos drivers porque no puedo hallarlos en el DOS.<br>  Y Dios dijo: ?Quién te dijo que necesitabas drivers? ?Ejecutaste Windows?<br>  Y el programador dijo: ?Fue Bill quien nos lo dijo!<br>  <br>  Y Dios dijo a Bill: Por lo que hiciste serás odiado por todas las criaturas, y el usuario estará siempre descontento contigo.<br>  <br>  Y Dios dijo al usuario: Por lo que hiciste Windows te decepcionará y se comerá todos tus recursos y siempre confiarás en la ayuda del programador.<br>  <br>  Y Dios dijo al programador: Porque oíste al usuario nunca serás feliz. Todos tus programas tendrán errores y tendrás que arreglarlos hasta el fin de los tiempos.<br>  <br>  Y Dios los echó del centro de datos y cerró la puerta, la encriptó y la aseguró con una clave.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Ahhh... se me olvidaba.

wqITWvPOaa	Sharing an internet connection via bluetooth is not the most practical method, as the range is very limited (only about 10 meters), and it is rather slow. If you only need to share it within this distance though, then it is fine. You'll need a bluetooth wireless router which costs anywhere from ￡20-￡50 (but they all do the same thing, so go for the cheaper one), and it will come with its own software to install. You'll need bluetooth on all computers that you want to share the connection with, and it may need to be configured on these computers aswell, but instructions will be in the manual.|`|NucPmqVFaa	hi check this link its good<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://buyingandsellingshares.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://buyingandsellingshares.blogspot.c...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .

1nBup6LZaa	Hello, I also have a Sony Vaio Laptop, after upgrading to Window vista, I was having exact same problem., I changed my mouse pointer. Just right click on your desk top and choose "personalize", then choose "mouse pointer", and it would give you a whole bunch of pointers, Choose the one has color and more visible. My problem is not fully resolved, but still better after changing the pointer. Also I notice one thing, when I use external display, mouse works fine. you ca also try changing the resolutions of your computer.<br>  Best luck!

If it does not load when the computer is restarted then you need to go into the bios and set the cd drive as the first boot device. There have been several different keys that have been used to bring up the bios when the computer boots up. These are normally either f6, f6, f9, or f12.

d0eaf72e5abcf572854010d8680d6a10aa	Do you mean 6 different files of 6 movies, or one big file with 6 movies? If you have 6 individual files, you need to render them with a video program or converter and burn each onto separate DVDs. The program will convert them into vob files playable on your DVD player. If it's one big file, you need to split it into 6 files, or if it's not too big, you can burn it and divide it into 6 chapters, each a different movie. But a file with 6 movies might just be too big to go on a single-sided DVD, or even a double, and will take a age to render.

If you can see the path of the directory, then you've found them.  If it's too small to see, easiest way is to right click, hit properties, then you'll see where they are at.  If you don't find any that way try searching for " *.bmp ", or " *.gif "  If you used your camera to transfer them, chances are they are in the jpg format.  If they aren't you'll have to figure out what file extension they are in.  If you don't know, transfer one from your camera and see what format it's in.  It'll be filename.gif, use that 'gif' or whatever yours says to find it the same way using the steps above...hope that helps--Melissa|`|0cd14558b59bca02f88377d3fee26645aa	Long story short, are you using Vista?

I personally like CCleaner because it does more than just clean my registry.<br>  <br>  1) CCleaner is a freeware system optimization and privacy tool.

AA11988040	Some DVD players will only play one or the other DVD-R or DVD+R. Also some burners will only burn to one or the other. Also you may need to get DVD Shrink 3.2 and shrink the movie to a folder first in order for it to fit on a DVD+ or - R. Then after shrinking it use Nero to point to that folder and burn it that way. I have found that the slower the speed the better the burn also.

You can be outside and access in, or inside and access out, but not both at the same time.<br>  <br>  You must physically connect a cable to the modem and specify an IP address in the same range as the modem, and specify the modem as the gateway in order to access the modem's configuration page.|`|DwECozsGaa	I would imagine your laptop IP address would be assigned an IP address on the same local network as your DSL modem and the Wireless router.....since the IP addresses are coming from the service provider. SO I would just try typing in the IP address in your browser(of the DSL modem)
h99jUANLaa	nobody really cares your comments....only bored people read them|`|T7ga2HBBaa	I am not sure if there is a comment reducer but you should check out some websites that have generator sections. If you have no idea what websites to look at then search myspace generators and get some myspace generators.

Go to a website that offers Generators. They will have codes you post in your profile for things such as comments, friends, and even the font.<br>  <br>  Try one of those.

Intel Core Duo is the best processor available. Another good option is AMD Turion Core Duo. I prefer Intel. Dell Inspiron 1720, 1520 are gud affordable laptops. Do me a favour. Log on to www.dell.com.xx (ur country's dell website) and take a look at the categories of notebooks.

Browser, I'd go with Firefox.  Internet Explorer 7 is better than 6, but Firefox is better than both (and more secure).  Windows Media Player 10 (not 11) should be all you need for music and video.  The security in my desktop PC is Zone Alarm Internet Security Suite (firewall, anti-virus, anti-spyware), Ad-Aware, Spybot Search & Destroy, and Spyware Blaster.  And CCleaner to keep my Registry clean.  My computer runs great and I have almost no problems with spyware and I haven't gotten a virus in about two years (which I attribute to the effectiveness of Zone Alarm; I used to run Norton but Zone Alarm is better).|`|AA11227423	Dell, Windows XP or Vista...<br>  <br>  I have a Compaq Presario, running Windows XP (dual-boot with Ubuntu Linux) I use Media Monkey, AVG Free, Spybot Search & Destroy, AdAware, run Firefox as my browser, Thunderbird for email.<br>  <br>  I'd like to get a Dell at some point, but this one I have now has been good to me and I have had no problems ever.

Go to system tools and tell it to clean up unneeded files. Then do a defrag. This can take a long time. Now look at the tray on the bottom right. If you have more then 5 items open you have too much going on. <br>  Of course speed is relative. You may have too many programs open at the same time. You may have a virus or you may be fighting off popups and spam.<br>  You may have an older computer. Anything under 800 MHZ and 128 mg Ram is hard to use in this time. If you have dial up Internet that could be the problem. You can only download as fast as the carrier sends it to.<br>  Go to your help screen it helps a lot.|`|Q9PBjnRCaa	Maybe it's your connection.My computer was running slow so I called my internet provider(mediacom)and  they told me what to do.I have DSL.If you have dial-up it's only natural that it's slow.It could also be you need more memory.

7d04e3e741ffe446f6f8e553ae3e5557aa	If the game is a recent title, a Nvidia 6200 card will barely cut it. The card is TWO generations behind. First thing I would recommend is getting a newer card at least a 7xxx. However, you can do some things to improve performance if you don't want to buy a new card since you just got this one:<br>  <br>  1. Download new drivers from <a href="http://www.omegadrivers.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.omegadrivers.net/</a><br>                *************These drivers are tweeked just a little and help improve performance over Nvidia's standard drivers.<br>  2. Lower the resolution and other specs in the  game. <br>                 *************This will make the game look worse but improve performance.<br>  3. Upgrade other components like the RAM or CPU.<br>                 *************This will increase you computer's ability to handle newer games. RAM is one of the best things to upgrade when you need your computer to be able to handle a bit more. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!!|`|DvDK4BKeaa	uninstall the driver of your graphics card in control panel (add/remove programs ---> name of the driver ---> change/remove). after that, used the enclosed cd driver of your nvidia 6200 to install. if nothing happens, try to update the driver from the manufacturer site in the internet. hope it works..

Cingular/at&t have the fastest cards but only if you live in or near a town that has 3g enabled. Sprint has the best overall broadband overage.

IWcEDW01aa	You need to buy a wireless router such as Lynksys or Netgear. They range between $29.99-$199.00. After purchasing this item, you will connect it to the modem you received from AT&T. This will create a wireless signal that will give your laptop internet access without the hardwire. There is no need to get another modem. The wireless router will come with at least 2 ports, most come with 4 ports. IF the modem doesn't have multiple ports you can plug the wireless router into the modem, and plug your desk top into the wireless router. It will act as a hub. You can purchase these items at Fry's Electronics, Best Buy, Walmart, Costco. Pretty much any retailer that sells computer components. I used to be a computer components sales person, and this is the best advice I can give you.|`|4fb12a44c5ddc260be59333502d753b4aa	Buy a wireless router. Then connect it to the line (the line should run from the wall to the modem, then on to the router). The router should have ports to plug in cables if you want to keep a computer wired, but it will also have antennas for the wireless.|`|AA10789090	All you need is to get a wireless capable router. To put it simply; your existing Internet connection will plug into the router and your computers will connect to it. This creates a network which shares your Internet connection. <br>  <br>  Linksys, D-Link, 3-com and Belkin are some common brands. They come with instruction CDs and are easy to install for most people.|`|9dLFa4ohaa	the modem doesnt support wireless.  you have to buy the 4 port 2wire wireless router from them to get wireless access.  in fact, with the modem, you are only allowed to connect 1 device to it, so if you have a computer and a laptop, you can only have 1 connected at a time.  The reason is, att only provides you with one dynamic public IP address with your line.  You will need a router that supports NAT, and will have to setup your own private subnet.<br>  <br>  <br>  ___________<br>  <br>  <br>  yea, you can also do what the guy above me said as well, buy a router and connect it to your modem.

Viruses can wreak havoc on your system and use up all of your system resources, so that's probably your problem.<br>  <br>  If you have less than 5 GB of free space on your hard drive, start clearing things out. Also, if you have less than 512 MB (for XP) or 1 GB (for Vista), consider upgrading your RAM. If neither one of those helps you then it's most likely one or more viruses slowing you down. The only real solution if that's your problem is to completely wipe your hard drive and reinstall Windows. You can try anti-virus software but it sounds like you've pretty much hit the point-of-no-return.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to have to deal with this problem again, consider switching to a version of Linux like Ubuntu or PCLinuxOS. There are Linux viruses out there, but the number is less than 1,000 (compared to over 100,000 for Windows), and they can't be caught by just downloading files. You have to actually install the virus to catch it, which involves opening an installer file and entering a user name and password.<br>  <br>  The nice thing about using Linux, besides the fact that it's free, is that you can make your kids' user accounts Standard accounts. Standard accounts can only install software to their own accounts and can't make system-wide changes. That means that even if they do manage to somehow install one of these viruses (which isn't likely), it will only affect their user account. In Windows, if you catch a bunch of viruses and your system becomes unstable or unusable, you have to erase everything and start over. In Linux, if a Standard account becomes unusable or unstable, you just delete the account and create a new one, and everything is back to normal.

76ab5536799c82c1fd94753078dfae8faa	A ver, espero saber explicarme:<br>  Imagínate que estás trabajando en un ordenador en modo usuario, y de repente necesitas algo que está en modo supervisor (y que por lo tanto limita el acceso). Entonces tu programa se para y hace el TRAP para acceder al modo supervisor (donde se tendrá uno que autenticar como usuario y al grupo que pertenece).<br>  Es como una especie de interrupción para buscar información en otros sitios (que también se puede hacer para ir a memoria virtual).<br>  <br>  Y creo que es así más o menos, no sé si te liaré más, pero es de lo poco que me enteré en cierta asignatura de Sistemas Operativos el a?o pasado.|`|788174e879f081e4311b77eb04346f54aa	Hola.<br>  <br>  El comando TRAP se puede usar para capturar o ignorar las se?ales del sistema operativo.<br>  <br>  El formato del comando TRAP es : <br>  trap ?lista-comandos? lista-se?ales <br>  <br>  Las se?ales mas comunes para usar con TRAP son:<br>  <br>  0 - Salida del Shell (por cualquier razón, incluido fin de archivo).<br>  1 - Colgar.<br>  2 - Interrupción. (^C).<br>  3 - Quit (^\\ ; causa que el programa produzca un core dump).<br>  9 - Kill (no puede ser parada ni ignorada).<br>  15 - Terminate (se?al por defecto generada por Kill).<br>  <br>  Las cinco entradas de interrupcion hardware estan listadas por prioridades en la columna izquierda. La interupcion de mas alta prioridad es la de la entrada TRAP.<br>  <br>  Una vez que alcanza el nivel ALTO, la entrada TRAP hara que el 8085 guarde en la pila el contenido del contador de programa y salte a la posicion de memoria 002eH.<br>  <br>  La entrada TRAP no puede ser inhabilitada y por tanto se denomina interrupcion no enmascarable. Varios TRAPS pueden tener efecto al mismo tiempo. Si se reciben varias se?ales simultáneamente, serán despachadas en orden ascendente. <br>  <br>  La implementación (o emulación) en UNIX, en especial la transportabilidad del código máquina ejecutable, se realizan gracias a las amadas de petición de servicio (instrucciones TRAP).<br>  <br>  Estas instrucciones TRAP se interceptan por el microkernel que, sabiendo de qué se trata, inmediatamente las redirige mediante una ``llamada ascendente" o upcall (de ahí el nombre de `trampolín") hacia la biblioteca dinámica correspondiente que (re)implementa el sistema UNIX. <br>  <br>  El retorno de la llamada puede hacerse otra vez a través del núcleo o directamente desde la biblioteca que emula UNIX al programa de aplicación. <br>  <br>  Saludos.|`|Qx2RoJWoaa	mami creo que debes ser mas especifica en tu pregunta por que yo conosco algo parecido pero es de humor luego te envio el chiste<br>  con cari?o felis dia  un beso

2LHgmq97aa	I use both.. But own PCs.. here are reasons why...<br>  <br>  PC=Variety of specs, options, quality, prices, vendors, support<br>  Mac=One vendor, limited options, still more expensive.  Look below for more information..<br>  ======================================...<br>  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. They use a lot of the same parts as PCs. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.<br>  <br>   Today, Macs use the same hardware as PCs. Why spend extra to get the same CPU chips, graphics cards  and OS X isn't as secure as you think.. Look below.<br>  <br>  WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:<br>  <br>  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. PCs include windows already pre-installed.<br>  1) There are a number of websites that still require Internet Explorer to view.<br>  2) Printers and other things you hook into the computer are easier to support on Windows.<br>  4) If you like the Dock on OS X (Mac) google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.<br>  <br>  I Would also install Avira AntiVir on the Vista since there is a FREE version and works well.<br>  I Would also install Comodo FireWall on the Vista since there is a FREE version and works well.<br>  <br>  <br>  LINUX ADVANTAGES:<br>  <br>  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of stuff for free. Updates done, etc.. Linux is very EASY and has tons of software that will be updated automatically.<br>  2) If you like the effects on a Macintosh go yahoo or google COMPIZ FUSION. It can do just about any cool effect a Mac can do and more...<br>  3) If you like the Dock on OS X (Mac) google/yahoo Cairo Dock, avant window navigator.<br>  4) Linux is MORE SECURE. I surf the internet and can even run SOME windows programs on Linux. Also, I can VERY EASILY INSTALL programs by checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (ADD/REMOVE or SYNAPTIC PACKAGE MANAGER). I can search for something I want, check a box and click apply. The program is automatically installed. (To me that is easier than searching the internet and dragging the program in MAC).<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  LINUX OS<br>  <br>  Easily turn your system into a Dual booting computer with Linux, fast, safe and secure, easy to use (contrary to belief). You then get the best of both worlds (Windows with all of its supported products, freely go online without the worry)<br>  <br>  My Recomendation would be either Ubuntu (Most popular and well supported linux), Kubuntu (KDE version of Ubuntu),<br>  Freespire (has all windows codecs for watching videos, dvds out of the box),<br>  PCLINUXOS (very nice Linux, easy to use and polished),<br>  There are so many good versions of linux besides these.<br>  <br>  PLEASE NOTE: In linux there are many forms of Windows Environments, the two main ones are KDE (K Desktop) and GNOME. Ubuntu uses GNOME, KUBUNTU is a KDE version of Ubuntu, PCLINUXOS, Freespire use KDE... The differences in the window environments (DESKTOPS) control how you configure, open close the windows, the appearances of the windows... linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting helps with printer support. ScreenCasts.ubuntu.com shows video and non-video help with learning to work with Ubuntu.<br>  <br>  There are many good Linux distributions for different reasons, distrowatch.com, polishlinux.org, desktoplinux.com<br>  are good websites for overall understanding linux.<br>  <br>  Installing Linux in general is very simple and much more secure than OS X(Macintosh) and FREE.<br>  Also, most Linux distributions have a LiveCD which means you can try without installing...<br>  UBUNTU, KUBUNTU, FREESPIRE, PCLINUXOS, etc.. all have live CDS.<br>  All you have to do is..<br>  A) to download .iso file off the internet from the Linux website<br>  B) burn the .iso file to a CD or DVD (Make sure your burning software can burn an ISO)<br>  C) restart the computer with the CD in the drive<br>  D) As computer is restarting, press on F12 Key a bunch of times to get a boot menu<br>  E) Select the option to boot from CD or DVD.<br>  <br>  ANOTHER QUICK NOTE: People have been able to run OS X on a PC since the PC and Mac use the same hardware. THIS IS NOT LEGAL and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR SECURITY AND LEGAL REASONS.<br>  But, I have included a link to show you, purpose is to show that there is nothing special about the MAC.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  A)Price...<br>  A similar equipped PC is much cheaper to purchase than Mac. Lets use Dell (but you can compare with another PC Brand if you like)<br>  <br>  *****************(LAPTOP)<br>  Dell Inspiron Laptop $849 dropped to $799<br>  15" Screen<br>  CPU: (upgrade to) 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo<br>  Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100<br>  Memory: 3GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM<br>  Hard Drive: 320GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm<br>  Optical Drive: Blu-ray Disc Combo (DVD+/-RW + BD-ROM) - WRITES DVDS,CDS, READS Blue-Ray Disks<br>  <br>  Macbook $1349 just dropped to $1224<br>  13" Screen (SMALLER)<br>  CPU: 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (SAME)<br>  Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 (SAME)<br>  Memory: (upgrade to) 2GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM (LESS RAM)<br>  Hard Drive (upgrade to) 250GBSerial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm (SMALLER HARD DRIVE)<br>  Optical Drive: (DVD-ROM/CD-RW) - (Writes CDs, DVDs, cannot read Blue-Ray) (WORSE AND 1/2 SPEED)<br>  <br>  ****************(DESKTOP)<br>  <br>  PLEASE NOTE: Some responses might be that below is not a FAIR comparison but it is SINCE this is comparing Apple Mac's BEST DEAL vs Dells BEST DEAL. If you decide that you must have an all-in one. The Dell all-in-one has more ram, WIRELESS keyboard and mouse and equivalent to $400 for free making the Imac still more expensive when you upgrade the Imac to try to match. Personally I don't think the ALL-IN-ONES are a good choice, and consider them overpriced, lack expandability and repairs both more expensive and require the entire computer. To me it is NOT a good deal.<br>  <br>  PS: Apple was smart, they know that they must make Macintosh look different than PC so all Macs except the Mac Pro will not have a Tower Option. This is not good for the consumer since it lacks expandability but it makes the Mac "look different", if Mac had a tower for low-end, more people would realize the similarities between the two and apple would loose people. In other words, in my opinion, it is "Style over Substance"<br>  <br>  Dell: (Right Now) Specs Below costs $809<br>  CPU: 2.4 GHZ Dell Inspiron QUAD (4 Processor) CORE<br>  SCREEN: 20inch Screen<br>  MEMORY: 3GB Ram<br>  HARD DRIVE: 500 GB hard Drive<br>  OPTICAL DRIVE: 16x DVD/CD Read/Writer<br>  GRAPHICS: (upgrade to ) ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB<br>  <br>  The Best Deal Mac is not the Mac Mini since it has no monitor, keyboard, mouse, very skimpy on options and setup... IMac is better price than the Mac Mini.<br>  <br>  IMac ($1400)<br>  CPU: 2.4 GHZ DUAL (2 Processor) CORE (SLOWER CPU)<br>  SCREEN: 20inch Screen<br>  MEMORY: (upgrade to) 2GB Ram (LESS RAM)<br>  HARD DRIVE: (upgrade to ) 500 GB hard Drive<br>  OPTICAL DRIVE: 8x DVD Reader/Writer (1/2 speed)<br>  GRAPHICS: ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB<br>  <br>  ************************END OF DESKTOP<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  B) SECURITY:<br>  <br>  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.<br>  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.<br>  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  B2) VIRUSES<br>  <br>  The argument that OS X has less viruses is true, but that is against XP, BUT Mac OS X has viruses, a friend of mine has a VIRUSED MAC. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe". Linux is also very low in viruses and is free with plenty of free software.<br>  <br>  Google/Yahoo Mac Viruses<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  C) Windows License is discounted with PCs..<br>  <br>  You do not pay the full price, for instance Dell -> you pay $50 or less for Vista Home Premium If you buy a Mac and want Vista, you pay full price.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  D) EXPANDABILITY & REPAIR...<br>  <br>  With AppleCare you have to put down $300 and there is no guarantee the computer will be fixed, may cost more.. Repairs are more expensive than PCs since the IMac, Mac Mini are compact units, and Apple charges a premium for their services. Some repairs can be done by another repair service but the compact design of the computer causes problems.<br>  With an IMac, if the problem is with the monitor, the whole computer would have to be brought in.<br>  IMac and Mac mini lack expansion.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  E) PROBLEMS<br>  <br>  Macintosh's are far from bug free despite their fan base claiming so. Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc.. True, all computers have their issues but Apple Fans tend to hide their problems which makes it tough to trust any statistics about Apple.(Not all Apple users are "Apple Fans", more of its users are naturally "Apple Fans" since it is such a small percentage of the market, and since they tend to consider Microsoft and PCs evil, tend to be more radical and get people to switch at any cost.) Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems SLOWING DOWN.<br>  <br>  NO MORE THAN 10 Links were allowed...

You can only buy RAM from a computer store or online. Just make sure you get the right one. You can get a 1G of RAM for $20. Your best bet in getting the right type of RAM for your computer (DDR, DDR2,DDR3) is typing your computer information in the search page...ex Dell Inspiron 6000 RAM upgrades. <br>    Also, there might be an electronic swapmeet in your town, or locale where you can get what you need for nickels on the dollar-meaning you are saving some major money. |`|KNppmXiXaa	RAM is hardware, not software.

RAM is physical memory, and downloading is transferring of virtual data. But if you mean getting more RAM by using a external drive, then you can look for programs that allow you to do so. 
2LHgmq97aa	The PC is the better Choice, here is why...<br>  <br>  For you, Linux offers awesome word processing and other tools for free. Windows more variety of Software than OS X.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. They use a lot of the same parts as PCs. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.<br>  <br>   Today, Macs use the same hardware as PCs. Why spend extra to get the same CPU chips, graphics cards  and OS X isn't as secure as you think.. Look below.<br>  <br>  WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:<br>  <br>  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. PCs include windows already PRE-INSTALLED.<br>  1) There are a number of websites that still require Internet Explorer to view.<br>  2) Printers and other things you hook into the computer are easier to support on Windows.<br>  4) If you like the Dock on OS X (Mac) google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.<br>  <br>  I Would also install Avira AntiVir on the Vista since there is a FREE version and works well.<br>  I Would also install Comodo FireWall on the Vista since there is a FREE version and works well.<br>  <br>  <br>  LINUX ADVANTAGES:<br>  <br>  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of stuff for free. Updates done, etc.. Linux is very EASY and has tons of software that will be updated automatically.<br>  2) If you like the effects on a Macintosh go yahoo or google COMPIZ FUSION. It can do just about any cool effect a Mac can do and more...<br>  3) If you like the Dock on OS X (Mac) google/yahoo Cairo Dock, avant window navigator.<br>  4) Linux is MORE SECURE. I surf the internet and can even run SOME windows programs on Linux. Also, I can VERY EASILY INSTALL programs by checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (ADD/REMOVE or SYNAPTIC PACKAGE MANAGER). I can search for something I want, check a box and click apply. The program is automatically installed. (To me that is easier than searching the internet and dragging the program in MAC).<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  LINUX OS<br>  <br>  Easily turn your system into a Dual booting computer with Linux, fast, safe and secure, easy to use (contrary to belief). You then get the best of both worlds (Windows with all of its supported products, freely go online without the worry)<br>  <br>  My Recomendation would be either Ubuntu (Most popular and well supported linux), Kubuntu (KDE version of Ubuntu),<br>  Freespire (has all windows codecs for watching videos, dvds out of the box),<br>  PCLINUXOS (very nice Linux, easy to use and polished),<br>  There are so many good versions of linux besides these.<br>  <br>  PLEASE NOTE: In linux there are many forms of Windows Environments, the two main ones are KDE (K Desktop) and GNOME. Ubuntu uses GNOME, KUBUNTU is a KDE version of Ubuntu, PCLINUXOS, Freespire use KDE... The differences in the window environments (DESKTOPS) control how you configure, open close the windows, the appearances of the windows... linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting helps with printer support. ScreenCasts.ubuntu.com shows video and non-video help with learning to work with Ubuntu.<br>  <br>  There are many good Linux distributions for different reasons, distrowatch.com, polishlinux.org, desktoplinux.com<br>  are good websites for overall understanding linux.<br>  <br>  Installing Linux in general is very simple and much more secure than OS X(Macintosh) and FREE.<br>  Also, most Linux distributions have a LiveCD which means you can try without installing...<br>  UBUNTU, KUBUNTU, FREESPIRE, PCLINUXOS, etc.. all have live CDS.<br>  All you have to do is..<br>  A) to download .iso file off the internet from the Linux website<br>  B) burn the .iso file to a CD or DVD (Make sure your burning software can burn an ISO)<br>  C) restart the computer with the CD in the drive<br>  D) As computer is restarting, press on F12 Key a bunch of times to get a boot menu<br>  E) Select the option to boot from CD or DVD.<br>  <br>  ANOTHER QUICK NOTE: People have been able to run OS X on a PC since the PC and Mac use the same hardware. THIS IS NOT LEGAL and I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT FOR SECURITY AND LEGAL REASONS.<br>  But, I have included a link to show you, purpose is to show that there is nothing special about the MAC.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  <br>  <br>  A)Price...<br>  A similar equipped PC is much cheaper to purchase than Mac. Lets use Dell (but you can compare with another PC Brand if you like)<br>  <br>  *****************(LAPTOP)<br>  Dell Inspiron Laptop $849<br>  15" Screen<br>  CPU: (upgrade to) 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo<br>  Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100<br>  Memory: 3GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM<br>  Hard Drive: 320GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm<br>  Optical Drive: Blu-ray Disc Combo (DVD+/-RW + BD-ROM) - WRITES DVDS,CDS, READS Blue-Ray Disks<br>  <br>  Macbook $1349<br>  13" Screen (SMALLER)<br>  CPU: 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (SAME)<br>  Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 (SAME)<br>  Memory: (upgrade to) 2GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM (LESS RAM)<br>  Hard Drive (upgrade to) 250GBSerial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm (SMALLER HARD DRIVE)<br>  Optical Drive: (DVD-ROM/CD-RW) - (Writes CDs, ONLY reads DVDs, cannot read Blue-Ray) (WORSE)<br>  <br>  ****************(DESKTOP)<br>  <br>  PLEASE NOTE: Some responses might be that below is not a FAIR comparison but it is SINCE this is comparing Apple Mac's BEST DEAL vs Dells BEST DEAL. If you decide that you must have an all-in one. The Dell all-in-one has more ram, WIRELESS keyboard and mouse and equivalent to $400 for free making the Imac still more expensive when you upgrade the Imac to try to match. Personally I don't think the ALL-IN-ONES are a good choice, and consider them overpriced, lack expandability and repairs both more expensive and require the entire computer. To me it is NOT a good deal.<br>  <br>  PS: Apple was smart, they know that they must make Macintosh look different than PC so all Macs except the Mac Pro will not have a Tower Option. This is not good for the consumer since it lacks expandability but it makes the Mac "look different", if Mac had a tower for low-end, more people would realize the simularities between the two and apple would loose people. In other words, in my opinion, it is "Style over Substance"<br>  <br>  Dell: (Right Now) Specs Below costs $809<br>  CPU: 2.4 GHZ Dell Inspiron QUAD (4 Processor) CORE<br>  SCREEN: 20inch Screen<br>  MEMORY: 3GB Ram<br>  HARD DRIVE: 500 GB hard Drive<br>  OPTICAL DRIVE: 16x DVD/CD Read/Writer<br>  GRAPHICS: (upgrade to ) ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB<br>  <br>  The Best Deal Mac is not the Mac Mini since it has no monitor, keyboard, mouse, very skimpy on options and setup... IMac is better price than the Mac Mini.<br>  <br>  IMac ($1400)<br>  CPU: 2.4 GHZ DUAL (2 Processor) CORE (SLOWER CPU)<br>  SCREEN: 20inch Screen<br>  MEMORY: (upgrade to) 2GB Ram (LESS RAM)<br>  HARD DRIVE: (upgrade to ) 500 GB hard Drive<br>  OPTICAL DRIVE: 8x DVD Reader/Writer (1/2 speed)<br>  GRAPHICS: ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB<br>  <br>  ************************END OF DESKTOP<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  B) SECURITY:<br>  <br>  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.<br>  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.<br>  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  B2) VIRUSES<br>  <br>  The argument that OS X has less viruses is true, but that is against XP, BUT Mac OS X has viruses, a friend of mine has a VIRUSED MAC. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe". Linux is also very low in viruses and is free with plenty of free software.<br>  <br>  Google/Yahoo Mac Viruses<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  C) Windows License is discounted with PCs..<br>  <br>  You do not pay the full price, for instance Dell -> you pay $50 or less for Vista Home Premium If you buy a Mac and want Vista, you pay full price.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  D) EXPANDABILITY & REPAIR...<br>  <br>  With AppleCare you have to put down $300 and there is no guarantee the computer will be fixed, may cost more.. Repairs are more expensive than PCs since the IMac, Mac Mini are compact units, and Apple charges a premium for their services. Some repairs can be done by another repair service but the compact design of the computer causes problems.<br>  With an IMac, if the problem is with the monitor, the whole computer would have to be brought in.<br>  IMac and Mac mini lack expansion.<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  E) BUGS<br>  <br>  Macintosh's are far from bug free despite their fan base claiming so. Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc.. True, all computers have their issues but Apple Fans tend to hide their problems which makes it tough to trust any statistics about Apple.<br>  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts.<br>  <br>  NO MORE THAN 10 Links were allowed...

You don't have to worry about viruses as well as once you save and exit any files or applications they automatically encrypt so others can not access your files. The only good thing I see about owning DOS operated laptops is there are more programs and applications that you can add, and you have more flexibility to change the configurations via the DOS command line interface.  However, like I said, I prefer MAC, that's what I used in high school back in the days. I am working on a desktop that I can switch between 3 different operating systems-Windows,MAC and Linux. <br>  <br>    Either way, if you want ease, and don't have to ever worry about viruses go with a MAC.|`|xsprvlL3aa	Just go with what you like!! Everyone will tell you what they think is best for them.  Like me, I love my PC!  but some would say it sux! lol!<br>  If you like Apple, you should go with it! |`|bf83119e024ab64c983c6074c0bb966caa	There is no use in buying a macbook unless you're going to pay the heavy price tag of a macbook pro... which from your described needs... would be overkill. People are fond of macs for their ease of use and incredible media capabilities... however unless you're a graphic designer and looking to spend upwards of two grand, a PC notebook is a much more efficient, economical machine. The regular macbook (not pro) is rather overpriced for the unimpressive system that it is. You can get a PC notebook with much better specs for hundreds less.<br>  <br>  Brands I would suggest are Dell, HP, and Toshiba. Anything with 3 or more gig of memory and 100 or more gig of hard drive space should suit your needs. If you really plan to have hundreds of documents, go with a larger hard drive, the price jump isn't huge from a machine with 150 gig to over 2 or 300 gig, and if that is what you require, it's deffinitely worth it. <br>  <br>  You'll also want to consider what OS (operating system) you're interested in using. Most new laptops come installed with Vista, but you can request another OS. Windows XP has been a very reliable OS, and many people are partial to it over the new Windows Vista. <br>  <br>  Ask any customer sales rep. in places like Best Buy, Staples, Circuit City, or wherver else you plan to buy your computer. They'll be able to help you find the notebook that is right for you.|`|w0vBHBBFaa	Price and reliability should be your primary concerns. Apple will probably skew to the higher end on price. I would visit several shops to test out various screens and keyboards. As those are the two components you will be using 100% of the time, every thing else is secondary in a laptop, especially from the usage you described. Be patient, don't get extended warranties, and do a Google search for product reviews.|`|bmCInR5qaa	For ease of use and word process/publishing programs, you can't beat Apple.  If price is a big consideration then go with a PC, not as user friendly or elegant but much cheaper.|`|AA11611248	The old Apple vs. PC debate is stale and not worth stressing over. If you are using the laptop for school, portability and writing, a Macbook is the best choice. You will have less frustration in using the Macbook and currently have zero danger from viruses and malware. The only reason for buying a PC laptop is if you are required to use software that can only be found on the PC platform.

C'est à dire que si le CD ne reconna?t pas la bonne carte mère (celle de ton ordi) il ne fonctionnera pas.<br>  En général tu n'as pas que Windows sur ce cd, mais tout un pack contenant aussi quelques logiciels et les drivers.<br>  <br>  Il est rare de nos jour de voir des constructeurs donner les cds des logiciels de leur matériel. Tu peux donc déjà t'estimer heureux de l'avoir.<br>  <br>  La licence OEM Microsoft est belle et bien "attachée" à ton ordinateur, le constructeur est donc en droit en de plomber ses cds pour t'empècher de les faire fonctionner ailleurs.<br>  <br>  La vente liée n'est que "tolérée" en France. Si tu n'es pas d'accord avec ce système tu peux exiger le remboursement  des logiciels du PC au prix courant dans le marché. Tu y gagneras environ 100€* après maintes embrouilles. Pour être en droit de toucher ce remboursement, tu ne dois pas utiliser les logiciels fournit avec l'ordinateur et t'engager à ne pas le faire. Si tu as déjà accepté et activé la licence Windows de ton PC, c'est trop tard.<br>  <br>  *Note que ce n'est interressant que si tu disposes déjà d'une licence Windows, ou si tu es un inconditionnel du Linux... Car sinon tu seras obligé d'en racheter une licence pour faire fonctionner ton PC.<br>  <br>  ***** ***** *****<br>  Astuce: Pour ceux qui n'ont pas d'OS légal et qui en veule un à moindre prix sans avoir à utiliser Linux:<br>  Un logiciel OEM coute environ 100€ de moins que ?a version "normale"; il est cependant identique au logiciel "normal" à la différence qu'il ne peut être vendu qu'avec un composant "essentiel" d'un PC comme une carte mère ou un disque dur. (Vous pouvez choisir ce composant)<br>  Or un disque dur de 320 Go coute maintenant moins de 100€. Comprenez donc que pour moins cher que le logiciel seul vous pouvez donc avoir un logiciel identique OEM et un disque dur de 320 Go.<br>  Au pire vous pouvez même revendre le disque dur sur Ebay.

XTBj2Vt6aa	well it all depends on how much your willing to pay. I am also a middle schooler looking to get a laptop. I also recommend an apple mac. They are pricey for about $1, 300 (Australian dollars) you can get a simple macbook with 1 gig RAM and a 160gig hard drive which is a bit pricey considering the amount of memory (not a heap) Macs are good for music, pictures, they have a great webcam, wireless, everything. they are light weight and not bulky which i good. If you are looking for something cheaper dell's laptops are OK, Compaq are OK, it all depends what you want with space and speed etc.<br>  link to apple website- <a href="http://www.apple.com/au/mac/" rel="nofollow">http://www.apple.com/au/mac/</a><br>  <br>  hope you find a good laptop|`|nk3GmOj7aa	First off look at TigerDirect and Newegg for laptops, they usually have teh best deals.<br>  <br>  Mac would be best for your criteria but that is out of the question due to price. And just for reference, Mac is not the best computer. There is no such thing as the best computer. My 4 year old laptop runs better than some modern computers just because I switched to Linux and fiddled around with the kernal to pump out more speed. Though that may be a little advanced for you...<br>  <br>  Though you don't need a laptop it is your decision and partly your money... So I can say nothing.

6cs4urcLaa	dutchie has most of it right!! demonoid is a private torrent tracker when members upload they can make it a private torrent to where only members can download. when u download a torrent there may be more than one tracker. demonoid members are very loyal to seeding which means more than one person is sharing it at a time therefore faster download. Other places just wanna download and not upload so not very many seeds!! slow download!!! Hail to all us members!!! bye the way you want your upload ratio higer than download ratio 1:5 at least or could get banned or have angry members on your case!!!|`|knmxq1o4aa	It is a torrent tracker download site. Depending on which torrent you are downloading and how well seeded it is (how many people are uploading the entire set of files to other users) then your download speeds will vary.|`|AA10677974	it is according to ur ratio of download and upload.<br>  <br>  make it balance 1:1|`|JbNYvqZoaa	It's due to the quality of your Internet connection.

You need to research the company for reliability of service, how fast they resolve issues, etc.
eGYKwGpOaa	Yes, you can transfer the files. Easiest is if you have a network. Next easiet is a flash drive, also called stick memory or thumb drive. CD-RW will work, too.<br>  <br>  It is not the operating systems but the program that created the files. For example, if you now use Office 2007, the files are in a different format (notice the x as in .docx that announces 2007) In that case go to the Microsoft website and download the Office converter|`|ko14epwKaa	If you are referring to files, then yes you can just copy and paste them.   The only conflicts I see:<br>  <br>  1.  Going from a 64bit version of vista(if you have this over the normal 32bit version)  to a 32bit version XP<br>  2.  Files created in newer versions of Word or Wordperfect.<br>  <br>   The only thing you will want to consider is if you created documents in Ms Word 2007(or any of the Office 2007), you may want to go back and save them as MS Word 2003/XP instead.
CWvIc4bpaa	Your best bet is using the install disc - it may allow you to install it on two computers, depending on the type of license and/or how long its been since the first one was installed.  It is not generally possible to move large pieces of software like that.  If the disc doesn't work or you don't have it, you will probably have to buy another copy - look for academic versions.<br>  <br>  Also, putting the hard drive in another computer will NOT work.  Trust me on this one (or try it, doesn't really bother me).  If the two computers do not have identical hardware, you will not be able to boot to the old hard drive, and attempting to run the files from your new OS suffers from the same problem as moving the files, there are many files and settings added to the OS by the installer that are required to make it work.<br>  <br>  Also, I do agree about Open Office being a good alternative.|`|3I6q9ZgEaa	What you can do is either set up a network so you can have access to his computer but that is a pretty hassle for this.<br>  <br>  Yeah, you can do what the other guy mention and take the harddrive and put it in yours assuming you are using a desktop and not a laptop. <br>  <br>  If you are using a laptop then you would have to do it through an external harddrive which can be slow since usb ports dont transfer data as fast.<br>  <br>  I believe you may be able to created an ISO of the program though i have never tried it with an installed program. <br>  <br>  My other suggestion is just download openoffice if you want some type of office suite that is compatiable with the windows one.|`|UwbefKmHaa	I dont think so, you should just take the hard drive from ur husbands pc, and just add it into yours, and you can just access the hard drive like a flash drive and use microsoft office wenever desired.

Abre el Nero burning rom y hasta arriba hay una pesta?ita que te permite elegir qué vas a grabar si un cd o DVD, elige DVD, después eliges la opción "crear disco de video", opción "New" te va a mandar a una pantalla dividida en cuatro secciones a la izquierda tienes la ruta de tu disco destino (el disco que vas a grabar) y a la derecha tus archivos origen (algo muy parecido al explorador de windows) cuando ya estés en esta pantalla verás que a la izquierda te marca el disco virgen (por ejemplo supongamos que sea unidad E:\) y en la seccion que sigue verás que se han creado dos carpetas una llamada AUDIO TS y otra llamada VIDEO TS, esta última carpeta estará marcada en rojo lo que indica que ahi vas a meter todos archivos de video, audio y subtitulos, ahora te vas a tus archivos de origen abres la carpeta donde los tienes y los seleccionas todos, después los arrastras con el ratón hacia la izquierda o si no le das click derecho y seleccionas la opción "copy to compilation" si son pocos archivos los pasará de volada, pero si son muchos y pesados te tardará un poco más depende de qué tan rápida sea tu pc, una vez que haya terminado de pasarlos a la compilación, verás los mismos archivos que tu seleccionaste pero ahora de tu lado izquierdo donde antes estaba en blanco. Ahora ya solo le das click en el iconito que tiene un disco con un cerillo y listo, ya todo lo hará la máquina, sólo asegurate de que la compilación que hagas no rebase de 4.3 gb ya que si no te marcará error la grabación o bien necesitarás un DVD virgen de doble cara y también un quemador DVD que soporte esa capacidad.<br>  Espero te sirva de algo esta información, yo asi he pasado mis videos a DVD para verlos en la TV y me ha funcionado muy bien.

Mn5Lhy1haa	Su tutti i Photoshop è presente lo strumento bacchetta magica, chiamato anche Chroma key, che elimina un'area di uno stesso colore, permettendo, usando i livelli, di mettere ad esempio un nuovo sfondo. Sul CS3 agisce a zone, ma il suo utilizzo è invariato:<br>  -Apri Photoshop.<br>  -Carica a foto da modificare.<br>  -Seleziona lo strumento bacchetta magica, che ha l'icona di una bacchetta circondata da puntini.<br>  -Con la bacchetta magica, clicca sull'area da eliminare (devi cliccare sullo spazio col colore predominante, mi spiego meglio: se hai uno sfondo blu, ma con qualche ombra quà e là, clicc asul blu e non sulle ombre).<br>  -Premi il tasto canc(attenzione: controlla bene che la linea tratteggiata non comprenda aree che non vuoi eliminare! Se è così, utilizza lo strimento lazo per eliminare le aree azzurre intorno alla figura che non vuoi cancellare, e poi utilizza la bacchetta magica.)<br>  -Se vuoi applicare un nuovo sfondo, usa la bacchetta magica sulla zona bianca intorno alla figura, poi clicca col destro e vai su seleziona inverso, poi apri il menù modifica e clicca su copia. Quindi apri la foto da modificare e vai modifica, quindi su incolla. Usando il cursore sposta la figura dove vuoi, e se vuoi ingrandirla, rimpicciolirla, girarla o capovolgerla, clicca su modifica dopo averla incollata e clicca su trasormazione libera. Usando i cursori alle estremità dell'immagine modellala come vuoi. Alla fine clicca su uno strumento qualsiasi dal pannello laterale (tipo il lazo) e clicca su applica.<br>  P.S.: salva l'immagine finale in Jpeg, perchè il formato PSD non è compatibile con quasi nessun programma, e non potresti quindi usare l'immagine.<br>  <br>  Se non sono stato chiaro, o vuoi saperne di più, chiedi e ti accottenterò!|`|RhDxdNQJaa	se i fondo è uniforme puoi usare la bacchetta magica e togli lo sfondo.. con  il tasto control aumenti i pixel selezionati e con alt li diminuisci.. oppure puoi usare "correzione colore selettiva" o mappa sfumatura nel menu a tendina|`|qErWDpf0aa	Non avendo fornito la versione del tuo Photoshop io te lo spiego riferendomi ad:<br>  Adobe Photoshop Elements 2.0<br>  <br>  1.

The only way to increase your speed is to pay for a faster connection :(|`|O5pdJqD6aa	unfortunately no, I also had Hughes net and looked into this. It is not the speed that is causing problems, it is the latency. It takes to long for the signal from the game to go to the satalite in space, then down to your house, then back up to space and then finally to the game server. It simply takes to long for all of that to take place in real time to keep up with the game.|`|rwiqaATPaa	Not really its just a disadvantage of the technology. The signal has to go REALLY far so there is a lot of latency.

As a person who has been involved in webpage design since the day of Windows 3.11 and Netscae Navigator 1.1, I may be able to tell you some tips about web site creation.<br>  <br>  First of all you must decide your web site's topic or theme. You should work on something you are good at. For instance, you can do something about programming, sports and games, travel, books review, astronomy, health, education, any hobby, and etc.<br>  <br>  Next, do some research by reading books, journal, info from the Internet and etc. Follow by designing a framework for your contents, get the main topic and subtopics properly arranged. <br>  <br>  To start writing your contents, you should use a GUI-based webpage development program such as MS Frontpage, Macromedia Dreamweaver and etc. Besides, you should also learn some basics of HTML so that you can customize your page better. <br>  For MS Frontpage, you have to purchase it. However, if you have Windows Vista, you can use notepad that come with it to design your web page using HTML.<br>  <br>  After you have done all your web pages, you can then contact a web hosting company to register your domain name and to get a web server to store your files for online viewing. you just need to pay a nominal fee. For example, domain name registration is only about USD$18. Offcourse you can register with a free hosting provides such as <br>  <br>  <a href="http://geocities.yahoo.com/">http://geocities.yahoo.com/</a><br>  <br>  You can view my web site that provides free Visual Basic tutorial to get a rough idea on how to create your web site. You can also learn HTML here.<br>  <br>  My web site has attracted about 4 million visitors since its inception.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vbtutor.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.vbtutor.net</a>

YvSG0Gujaa	with a dual core processor and having 2gig (which actually totals 4gig) RAM (random access memory) you will have no problems with this computer. And although it says expandable to 3gig, there are 4gig memory upgrades for the DDR2 type memory. <br>     I don't know where you are at, but you should also ask some of the computer professors and try to find an electronics swapmeet where you can get computers, laptops, and any other computer related components that are still in good condition or brand new for up to 75% less than what you would pay retail for.<br>    There is one in the Manhattan Beach, CA area which is held every last Saturday of the month and runs from 7am to 1130pm.<br>    I hope this answers your question.<br>  <br>  PS<br>    I just upgraded my 3 year old Dell Laptop Memory from 256mb to a total of 2gig Memory. So, if over the years you find you need more memory on either the hard drive or RAM, you can easily upgrade your memories. Most sales Associates and retailers don't tell you that because they want you to always buy a new one later down the road.<br>    Also, one thing I would recommend if you like music, which normally tends to slow your hard drive is to also invest in an external hard drive. Not only can you store your music there as well, but also back up your important files in case your computer becomes infected with a virus or you do upgrades on your operating system such as Vista or XP. |`|c8EURCYnaa	This computer is fine for your expressed purposes. As far as multitasking, I believe Vista will handle it as the processor is dual core.
BtoOiDHcaa	Do this first before taking it to a tech. <br>  1- take the battery out.<br>  2-unplug the cord from the outlet and from the laptop<br>  3-without the battery and the cord press and hold the power button for about 1 minute, ( this sounds stupid because the laptop isn't connected, and no battery, but the point is to get rid of the static trapped in the laptop, sorry I forgot the word for it)<br>  Anyway do this twice, then test it with only the power cord. if it doesnt turn on then Unplug power cord and put only the battery and try turning it on. <br>  When trying to turn the computer on with only the battery pay attention to the battery light, if it flashes it means that the battery is working, it just doesn't have enough power to turn your computer on, which means that you used it all and the problem is with either the power cord (which is most likely or the power supply depending how old is the system). Try  this and get all the details of how it went and what everything looked like, and if it is still doing the same thing, email me and I'll further help you ok?...|`|YvSG0Gujaa	You might have a defective battery. I recommend going to the website of the manufacturer of your laptop and see if there are any recalls regarding your laptop. <br>   |`|inN0WCqjaa	How old is your battery. if is 3 years old you have to replace it for a brand new. if is not then check the A/C adapter it might no be working properly.|`|al28dgRmaa	mine does this too you might need a new battery i would like to know to |`|Y1Ues6z2aa	one time this happened to me, and my dad just told me to restart my laptop. it worked fine afterwards|`|AA11562326	Things to check<br>  <br>  Is the outlet switched off (like some lamp outlets)?<br>  Is the power brick plugged in?<br>  Is the power cable securely plugged in to the laptop?<br>  If there is a light on the power brick, is it on?  If not, maybe the power brick burned out.  Try a different outlet that you know is working to confirm.

Your web host would say what shold be the name of the home page, index.htm is common, however, default.htm etc are common. It is assumed at this point your website is purely html (no server side tech as php, asp, jsp) It is highly recommended that a html tutorial as found in www.w3schools.com be used as dreamweaver and other WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) do not do everything and basic html knowledge is helpful. <br>  Cheers and all the best.|`|AyCECC33aa	There are 2 parts to creating a web page for your own.  The first it to register a site name and the second part is to have the site you registered hosted.

qpP0ypVzaa	check your drivers first.  Make sure you have the correct ones and they're up-to-date.<br>  <br>  Second, go in to Printers (Start -> Printers and Faxes).  Right click on the printer and hit "Printer Preferences" or something similar.  This screen that pops up is unique to the maker but you'll want to browse through it and make sure paper source, paper type, and any special instructions are all correct.  It's probably in there.

t5sYXwSqaa	This only happens when you try to access it through My Computer for example, other than that it starts and acts normally?? If so try setting a disk scan - go to my computer/ rights click on the C drive and select properties. Click on tools and check the check disk. Then close the computer and open it again. It will go through a disk check. If this fails then download TR (Trojan Remover from the Internet) and run it in normal mode. Delete anything it finds. Close computer and open in Safe Mode. Whilst computer is opening keep tapping F8 and choose open in safe mode. Run TR again and again delete any items that it finds.

AA10063130	You should check the baud rate on the aux port of the modem...sounds like a baud rate mismatch.  Best advice I can offer is to hook a PC serial port to the aux port on the router.  Set the PC serial port to 9600 baud 8 data bits 1 stop bit no flow control.  Then hit enter a few times and see if you get a prompt.  If you get garbage try adjusting the baud rate up or down until you get a legible prompt...also try power cycling the modem attached to the aux port...
