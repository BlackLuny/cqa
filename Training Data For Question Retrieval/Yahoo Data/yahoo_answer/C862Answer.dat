AA10368727	Healthcare Insurance Premiums are deductible as part of Medical and Dental expenses.  Only the amount of all of your medical and dental expenses that exceeds 7.5% of your Adjusted Gross Income can be deducted.<br>  <br>  A better bet is to see if your employer offers a Section 125 Premium Conversion Plan (more commonly known as a "Cafeteria Plan", which would allow your employer to deduct the cost of the premiums pre-tax and send it directly to your insurance company.  If your employer was willing to do this, then ALL of the money you spend on health insurance would be tax-free (not just income tax, but free of all OASDI, Medicare, and State taxes as well).

gFHTcIc8aa	Some highly transferable retail skills:  Working under pressure; when store is very busy, you need to make many quick decisions and work quickly.  Interpersonal skills; with high employee turnover and many customers you need to understand and work with people from many different backgrounds & races.You get a feeling for many different personality types.  Bookeeping; Do you have to handle money?  Are you responsible for cash reconciliation at the end of shift?  This involves trust as well as good math skills.    Engineering stresses problem solving.      You may want to say something like:  "My current experience in retailing has enhanced my interpersonal and quick decision making skills to complement my already strong problem solving ability".    Best of luck.  Hope this helps.

Medicines are limited to prescription drugs so over-the-counter drugs are not covered even if ordered under a doctor's prescription.  Gym and health club memberships are never deductible even if exercise is ordered by your physician as medically necessary.  And medical treatment or procedures that are purely cosmetic are not deductible.    Medical deductions are limited to 7.5% of your AGI so if your AGI was $40k, only those in excess of $3,000 would be deductible.  Of course your total itemized deductions must exceed the Standard Deduction amount for your filing status in order to get any benefit from itemizing.|`|81wShS3taa	To calculate your medical expenses you must calculate your total income then multiply by 7.5%.

pRF5LLloaa	it depends on the insurance policy,  but generally speaking at 18 they "cut you lose" from your parents policy.<br>  <br>  You need to have your parents talk with their insurance agent.  It may be that, since you are still in school, they MIGHT be able to cover you for another couple of years.  this is something maybe the agent can work out.<br>  <br>  If not . . . <br>  COBRA is a way to continue with exactly the same kind of insurance that you have now, except that YOU have to pay for it.  That can get REALLY expensive, like $1000 to $1500 PER MONTH.  And COBRA benefits are limited to 18 months.  After that you HAVE to find your own insurance.<br>  <br>  talk with your parents, and have them contact your insurance agent.  The "student deferment" option is your best choice to try right now.  if that fails the agent may have something available that is MUCH cheaper than COBRA.|`|AA11173563	at age 20 you are an adult. Sorry but you are. Now if still in school then you need to contact them and get that done today. If out of school then the COBRA is the same insurance but you have to pay the whole premium yourself|`|y2ZukikXaa	You were an adult at age 18....legally.  Sounds like your parents forgot to fill out the form to let them know you're a full time student so they're kicking you off the family plan.<br>  <br>  COBRA allows you to continue the plan on your own, but it's pretty costly compared to another plan you could get on your own (if you're healthy)|`|Jgg7ZTItaa	COBRA is a law that states that you can keep the insurance coverage the you had prior to some event that disqualifies you from the group plan.  <br>  <br>  Typically this is the case when a person has insurance through their employer, where the employer is paying part of the premium.  The employees changes job he/she is allowed to keep the insurance (up to 18 months) as long as they continue to pay the full premium amount.  <br>  <br>  This law was created so that you could continue to have insurance since you may not have another job or the new job requires you to be employed a certain amount of time prior to getting insurance benefits.  It also helps in situations where the new insurance would not cover a pre-existing condition.<br>  <br>  With that being said, your parents must of said or did something to get the insurance company to drop your coverage.  Because most insurance companies allow people to continue dependent coverage for full time college students up the the age of 22 -24.  Or the company changed plans which disqualified you from being covered.  I say this since it is the beginning of the year and this is when companies tend to change insurance coverage for their employees.  <br>  <br>  You need to ask your parents what happened.  There may be some form they need to fill out stating that you are a full time student, usually accompanied by something like you student ID or registrar statement from the scholl.|`|MmTe8W8uaa	Anyone at least 18 is a legal adult.  However, for certain purposes (including insurance), legal adulthood is not the relevant criteria.<br>  <br>  If your parents' insurance only covers dependents up to age 19, then you are no longer eligible, and the letter is correct.<br>  <br>  If your parents' insurance cover all dependents up to age 19 and full-time students up to age 24 (for example), then you or your parents need to send them documentation to prove that you are full-time student.<br>  <br>  COBRA is an acronym for a federal law that requires the insurance company to allow you to remain covered for an additional 18 months if you pay them some money.  The notice should say how much money.  Alternatively, you may wish to see if less expensive coverage is available from another source, such as the place where you are a student.|`|AA11064536	It is insurance against COBRA bites.<br>  <br>  LOL<br>  <br>  *|`|l2kQZQkwaa	Your insurance company just needs to be told about your full-time student status (20 units).  Your parents should simply call the Member Services phone number on their ID cards to get this straightened out.<br>  <br>  The Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives you the opportunity to keep your group insurance coverage in the event of termination (or becomming an inelible dependent due to age).  Typically COBRA lasts for 18 months and the premiums are 102% of the actual monthly billed rate (the 2% is for administration costs).
FQRjfbW6aa	Yes, stated income (aka liar loans) loans are gone.  Why would you have to do a stated income loan if you had enough income to qualify?  Anyway, while income wasn't verified or it wouldn't be a stated income loan, there was a chart that reputable lenders had to use.  It showed what was reasonable income for whatever line of work the borrower was in.  $100,000 for a babysitter would not have been able to be used.|`|AA11173563	your employer verifies your income.

All income must be verified by some source|`|2N6oTOLQaa	The whole idea of "stated income" loans was that you just stated your income and they believed you without verifying it. That's a part of why there is a big crisis in the housing market these days. Those loans are no longer available. <br>  <br>  You would need to show copies of your tax returns to verify your cash income. <br>  <br>  You did report all your income to the IRS didn't you? If you took the payment under the table in cash so you could skip out on taxes, then you shot yourself in the foot for trying to buy a house. You can't have the best of both worlds. If you are going to break the law to hide cash income, you can't use that income to qualify for a mortgage.|`|FfPUhCuiaa	There are no "stated income" loans anymore.  The stated income loans were not verified- that's a big part of the housing crisis we are in.  People just "stated" their income.  Babysitters, "stating" they made $100k per year.  You will not get a home loan now days if you can't prove your income.  And that is a good thing in my opinion.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	as the last poster said, if you were paid "under the table", than you cannot use that income to qualify for the loan.  stated income loans are a thing of the past.  they are a large reason that this country is in this mortgage mess and almost nobody does them anymore.|`|44209bed877d82f066bd0e61b8c60fa0aa	Your tax returns.
YbDf0uDHaa	Reporters traditionally don't tell readers in advance what stories they are working on. Reporters don't want to lose a potential scoop to a competitor by announcing what they are investigating before they have that story ready to go.<br>  <br>  Open source reporting takes the opposite approach. A reporter announces the topic he or she wishes to investigate, and invites readers to submit leads, tips, sources and ideas. The potential for a "scoop" is lost, as other writers can do the same thing. But open source reporting is based on a collaborative model, emerging from the ideal that a community of readers knows more, and has access to more resources, than a single reporter or newsroom. Open up your reporting process to engage that community, and you can report with greater speed and depth than you could on your own. Open source techniques can prove valuable for solo bloggers and small newsrooms that lack the resources of major news organizations.<br>  <br>  Simple open source reporting predates the Internet, as reporters and news organizations have run "tip lines" for years. But blogging and discussion forums now allow journalists to work with an unprecedented level of transparency throughout the reporting process.<br>  <br>  Distributed Reporting<br>  <br>  Distributed news reporting takes open source reporting one step further, by relying on readers to submit information themselves. In this model, readers become reporters, publishing information into a database of incident reports that is then coalesced for publication.<br>  <br>  A distributed news reporting effort can involve sophisticated Web front-ends, merged with detailed databases, such as US Geological Survey's "Did You Feel It?" earthquake shakemaps. Or they can be as simple as a Flickr collection of reader-submitted photographs sharing the same tag.<br>  <br>  The trick to good distributed reporting is to use this method for information about which a large number of readers are likely to have first-hand information, such as earthquake damage. Distributed reporting efforts also can effectively gather and sort published information, such as in TalkingPointsMemo.com's Katrina Timeline. Indeed, Wikipedia is perhaps the world's best-known example of a distributed online reporting project.<br>  <br>  Handled poorly, a distributed reporting effort can degenerate into an anonymous bulletin board, with false reports and defamation. But if a journalist designs his or her distributed reporting effort responsibly, sourcing all information and requiring readers to verify their identity to post (such as verifying an e-mail address), distributed reporting can produce a massive quantity of well-organized information in a fraction of the time it would take a traditional newsroom to do the same work.<br>  <br>  Traditional Reporting<br>  <br>  The three traditional methods for gathering information for a news story are through interviews, observation and document searches.<br>  <br>  1. Interviews<br>  <br>  Want to know what's happening? Find people who know and talk to them. The best sources are folks who were or are directly involved in the incident or subject that you're covering.<br>  <br>  Introduce yourself and say for whom you are writing. If you are recording the interview, be sure to ask permission first. It is illegal in many places to record someone without their consent. If you are unsure of your ability to take accurate notes, record the interview. Start by getting the source's name, and its spelling, as well as his or her official title, if it is revelant to the story.<br>  <br>  Ask questions that cannot be answered with a 'yes' or a 'no.' Instead, ask people to describe the incident or situation. Listen as they respond and imagine what additional information a reader would want. Then ask follow-up questions to get that information.<br>  <br>  Don't get intimidated and feel afraid that you are asking "dumb" questions. If your source says something you do not understand, ask them to explain it in simpler terms. If something a source says does not make sense to you, say why and ask for an explanation. If you don't understand something, your readers likely will not as well. Always be polite and respectful when interviewing someone, but respect your readers as well. Don't allow a source to intimidate you into not asking tough, appropriate questions.<br>  <br>  If you don't know whom to interview, PowerReporting.com offers a list of sites where you can find experts to interview on a wide range of subjects. If you end up dealing with a publicist, don't let them lead you by the nose. Let them help you set up interviews and obtain information, but come up with your own questions and own ideas for the story.<br>  <br>  2. Observation<br>  <br>  Your five senses can provide the details that help a make an otherwise dry story come to life for a reader. Even if you are "just" doing an interview, make note of the setting: What do you see? Hear? Smell? Feel? Drop those details into your story to help bring your reader into the place and the moment from where you are reporting.<br>  <br>  Be careful, how

OR    you can call up saying     "hello i was just wondering if you have any positions vacant at the moment"      and when you give your resume make sure that you call them about 4-5 days later and say to them    "Hi i recently applied for a job here and i was just wondering how far my resume has went through"    and they will reply either if you can come in for an interview or they'll say sorry..    i hoped this helped you and good luck with the job hunt    :)|`|LcLGnTVMaa	Listen Lady gave you good advice.

Why does your career have you start when you get older? You should start working on your instrument now!     First off, are you taking any classes? Though you can gain much experience from doing school plays I recommend you find yourself an acting school or some outside source for your practice. You could even write up scripts and start your own group of acting with friends (so many people do) and post on youtube for feedback!     As for a career in acting... you have to realize that if you're dreaming of the "A list" actor career, that could be a difficult gig to break in to. It's best to have a agent to help out with that. I feel that one of the best ways to get in through independent films. Ever heard of Sundance? If you get casted in a film that someone is going to send into a film festival that's a great way to get noticed and start your career profile!    Colleges... I know Boston University has a great school for acting. New York University is another. But that's about all I know specifically for that.

If you live in a state that allows sales tax deductions, look for the tax on big ticket items like furniture or Appliances.|`|NZuJR79oaa	No. but you're mortgage interest is tax deductible.     Don't feel bad. that tax credit is a 0% loan, it has to be paid back over 15 years. Congratulations on the new home.
oeCIzoF9aa	Yes if you get hurt you should immediately quit and sue their @$$es for what they made you do.  You would have a good case in court.  They forced you to do something the hard and dangerous way.      Or you could make them sign a contract saying that they are liable if you get injured.    It's not fair if you get injured because of someone else's arrogance.|`|baQpo0kdaa	idk but they suck!|`|6mcmeAe1aa	I would ask an officer or something.

Do not be so lazy as to not do your own basic research|`|YJrrZo9jaa	This is usually in the fine print somewhere.  They are required to get it to your house, that's it.  Back the truck up and then you're on your own.  Sometimes they will be nice and help you, but they are not obligated to do so.  You have to think of the liability from their end.  If the driver offers to help you and then dents the merchandise or puts a hole in your drywall, they're liable.  If YOU do it, well, its your house....|`|rLP9wjPtaa	Yes, it's legal. If you want the darn thing, unload it.|`|VJ7RH9Tpaa	bfdbfe|`|R8x9haDHaa	Is there a reason for doing that ?|`|AA12313339	Look at your purchase agreement.  Is it that you do not want the merchandise or you do not want to carry it off the truck?
NwkZ5OmCaa	You were both on the loan, so you both received a 1099-C.  Due to the way the tax law is written, you both got a 1099-C for the full amount, but the cancelled debt is reported on your taxes only once.|`|WiF4x8m3aa	Just One..

7b66d2834db760280c451eeb8819e4eaaa	From my experience, the IRS WMR site updates on Wednesday and Sunday nights.  I would guess your status will be updated Wed. night.  I doubt there is something wrong, just waiting for the IRS to catch up on all of this craziness this year.  I filed mine the first day (the 16th) and it was the next Thursday before WMR updated.|`|58pg8CUjaa	I filed last Mon. and was accepted last Tues. Mine still says still processing also. Are you talking about the IRS website?>|`|TNgq94Jdaa	As long as it say's accepted you should be okay, check back wednesday before the DD date and "processing" should change.
1YUNabs7aa	You also should compare car insurance quotes for different cars before buying one, for example here - autoinsurance.maclenet.com
N4xd99Qaaa	Yes any one can be rewarded garnishment from your wages based on the court decision of a judge (govt). Once the plaintiff is rewarded the garnishment then they can take the court documents to your employers human resource office and receive your money without any input from you at all. Luckily there is a maximum percentage a person's wage can be garnished. Usually like 10%, so that if multiple plaintiffs try to recevie garnishment then one will get it while the rest will be denied until the plaintiff receiving the garnishment is paid off.|`|geJM58L2aa	A lot of places can garnish your wages.  I used to work for a debt collection law firm and we had all sorts of clients - credit card companies, furniture stores, car dealerships, mechanic shops, pet stores, etc. Through the law firm, all of our clients were able to garnish wages.  You have to go through the court to get the judgement granted but it's completely legal.|`|nxEoR9CEaa	Creditors and the state can also garnish.  If you loose a civil suit, for example:  medical bills, attorney bills, utility bills, etc.  Also, for child support, and owed taxes.|`|AA12370001	a judgement given by a judge allows anyone to garnish your wages.|`|A1iDPPOeaa	The courts can garnish wages.|`|LIxpXTnLaa	heck yes furniture stores do it all the time.<br>  <br>  car lots, pawn shops, etc. it's very common.|`|AA11173563	yes any one that gets a judgment against you and the judge allows garnishment as a way to get paid. So any money owed and left unpaid could go this route|`|2N6oTOLQaa	The only way your wages can be garnished is if a judge orders your wages garnished, after a proper court hearing. However, anyone or any business that you owe money to, can take you to court and ask the judge to order your wages garnished for repayment of the debt. If the debt is legitimate and you have not been paying on it, then the judge will pretty much always agree and order your wages garnished. <br>  <br>  So nobody other than a judge can directly garnish your wages, but anyone you owe money to can get a judge to order your wages garnished.
Pjm9pg7iaa	The public problem started when banks loaned $200,000 as a mortgage to someone who had no job and bad credit. That person had no ability to repay the loan. It was ok for a while because home prices were going up $1,000 per week. But the loan should never have been made. At some point the homeowner is not going to make the payments.  The underlying problem was that banks are allowed to take some risks in lending their money. They can loan 12 times the amount of their assets. In 2004 banks started loaning out 33 times the amount of assets. That worked for a while but it can never work forever. At some point, some loans will go bad. The banks had no money to cover losses. And the other banks were in the same situation. The only one that would help them out was the federal govt. That is not the way the system is supposed to work..|`|0Wbtg6lIaa	It was made too easy to buy a home because the interest rates effected way back in 1998. Freddie and Fannie were given WAY too much power at the same time.  Everybody starts buying homes, then everyone else starts building more homes, then nobody can actually afford the homes they are in because of the horrible loans given (Fannie and Freddie). The next thing you have is a massive amount of foreclosed properties that nobody can afford, nobody wants and the banks can't afford to stockpile.  Everybody then needs rescuing from a system that no one can afford with one of our countries' biggest assets rotting in the toilet.  RECESSION  D

0E6u2YOGaa	The rules on this have changed recently - it's worth speaking to your local Post Office.    It was always the case that if you purchased something in the UK, took it abroad and brought it back, there would be no further duty.|`|BK30XyGraa	Surely if you have already paid tax on the item in the UK, you cannot be charged again. Check with the post office or UK Customs online.
SYAakSe1aa	You can easily check your minimal health insurance rates in internet, for example here - healthplans.bebto.com|`|Daq9gituaa	Under some circumstances a part of the health insurance premium can be deductible. If your parents have deductible expenses greater than their standard deduction then a portion of health/medical expenses are deductible. The portion that is deductible is calculated by multiplying their adjusted gross income by 7.5% and subtracting that result from their total medical expenses. The amount remaining is tax deductible.|`|TSYrJqTaaa	first,you should collect some resource  by searching the relevant keyword in search engine,if you got good luck there ,then your problem solved.however,if you are not able to find the ideal answer by doing that,here http://www.HealthInsuranceIdeas.info/fre...  is the resource i recommend.
Daq9gituaa	As for the federal taxes, as long as your gross income is under $56K, then you can use the IRS "free file" program. There are several providers available through the IRS free file program. I personally like Turbo Tax but you do the selecting. To acces the program, start on the following IRS web site: http://www.irs.gov/efile/article/0,,id=1...    From there, you will be redirected to your choice of providers. Just remember to start from the IRS web site or else you will be charged for the service.    As for state taxes, your state more than likely has a free file program of their own. To locate the information, type "name of state.gov" (virginia.gov). There should be some reference to the states taxation department on those pages.|`|AA11570236	Local IRS office can help you file.|`|ZTuBl0qLaa	The only way your going to be able to get them done for free is by doing them by yourself.If you don't know how to do them yourself you can go to your local library and they will help you.Or I know there are a few programs online that are very little cost.Good luck|`|TNgq94Jdaa	IRS.gov, select e-file for details.|`|7b66d2834db760280c451eeb8819e4eaaa	Go to the IRS website and look for free e-file.  Check out your state's government page for free state e-file.  I did my Federal free through Turbo Tax and my state was free through their own site.

373b04f6dbf649a6ef357e85b32df3e4aa	Have you tried your local council.    We were temporarily on benefits a few years back when we moved area whilst I was pregnant, We found a house but only because we had a guarentor, Someone who would agree to pay the rent if we didn't, and my partner had a few thousand pounds inheritance which he used towards.    It is difficult I know but you may find you need to get a job and save whilst living where you are, You will need 1,000 for the first months rent and bond, if not more.

EDIT i wasn't trying to be nasty about it, but honestly you may need to find a job first.  My husband is an estate agent and landlords aren't keen to let to people who are unemployed.  You can still claim housing benefit whilst you are working as long as you don't earn loads.    good luck|`|Hae8acnpaa	You do have to let your landlord know if you are claiming benefits as it affects their insurance etc.    It is harder to find a landlord to take DSS but they are still out there.    As for faking references I wouldn't advise that either as if you are caught you have lost the property - even if you are already in it.|`|ARAYm7BLaa	It's a real problem, I'd suggest advertising in a Newsagents Window.|`|5bM5PG1jaa	Which area are you in? How many are you looking to have living under your roof?  Do you have any deposit at all?|`|L4rlu2BDaa	Your local council housing office and CAB have a list of letting agents and private landlords who accept housing benefit. If your claiming Local housing allowance, all money is paid directly to you so you shouldn't have to tell the landlord your actually receiving benefits, most won't ask if you can pay the rent on time each month and you have the money for the deposit and months rent in advance you can get away with not saying anything.|`|chHPoiThaa	Take a good look at your self.
3MM64geHaa	Tax payers .  Employers pay taxes that go to pay unemployment.  The extended benefits are above what employers have paid in and our coming from tax payer's pockets.

The Taxpayers - we pay for everything in this country (and in others).
VM9KZ0CVaa	It doesn't have anything to do with when you filed your federal, it depends only on when you filed your state. Probably about 2 weeks if you filed online with the IRS website companies and allowed direct deposit.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	The two are totally unrelated.|`|764bc5ce74464135acb07208d143a013aa	Some people were receiving their state by DD before they even got their federal. Last year my state was direct deposited about 2 weeks after I got my federal return. That was South Carolina. I think it probably depends on which state it is, but there isn't any set time to receive your state refund.|`|Qt1rqPOoaa	6 monhts|`|TdIbrGYYaa	The one and the other have nothing to do with one another.  If you did direct deposit I would watch it.  My experience has always been that I get my State back first.

But if you aren't listed on the mortgage, no you can't since you aren't legally required to pay it.|`|UDxL7lPqaa	No.  Not unless you are on the loan.  Only the party legally required to pay the loan can claim the interest deduction.  Only the party legally required to pay property taxes (i.e., on the title) can legally claim the proprerty tax deduction.|`|paerqxfMaa	Only if the statement from the bank showing interest paid comes in your name, otherwise it's his to claim.|`|Vi8RDbhUaa	No, the mortgage would have to be in your name.
rLP9wjPtaa	Yes, within reason.  They have a commitment to the stockholder to negotiate with suppliers for the best price.
DAMZKbpDaa	This is a very complex question, and the answer is case by case, depending on your exact circumstances.    Going by tax considerations alone isn't the best way to do it.    Sole prop has the advantage of being simple. Corporations have some limited liability. C-Corporations, if your income is large enough, can enjoy somewhat if a tax advantage with income splitting, but you get a bit of a tax hit if your income isn't from "double taxation." S-Corps add a bit of limited liability protection, and work better than C-corps if you have a loss, but the tax situation is the same as DBA (more or less).
pK6VyLE1aa	wow    you know, this range can easily go from $10k to $100million, right?    you need to provide more info such as square footage, location, materials derisred, etc.    use your head|`|EGd63Nuiaa	Not much information to go on.

People who are already retired or about to retire within the next few months may have no choice.  But those who have a choice should wait until the value rebounds.  That may take several years, but you still have many years to go until retirement.<br>  <br>  Remember the old adage:  Buy low, sell high.  If you withdraw now, in addition to paying early withdrawal penalties, you will also be selling "low" which is the opposite of what you should be doing.<br>  <br>  Work at paying down the debt from current earnings, not by withdrawing money from your 403(b).<br>  <br>  Also, this is a good time to invest as much as you can in your current 403(b).  You would be buying "low" which is a good investment strategy.

His job is to ensure that his company operates at a profit and therefore operates at the most efficient level.

It is far better than making one or two people take all of the bad hours. It is actually quite fair. <br>  <br>  In return, your wife is provided a job with pay.

This goes away once you hit your full retirement age.  That is why most successful people that want to continue to work after age 62 don't tap social security until they are no longer penalized.

Some medical assistants are trained on the job, although this practice is less common than in the past. Applicants usually need a high school diploma or the equivalent. Recommended high school courses include mathematics, health, biology, typing, bookkeeping, computers, and office skills. Volunteer experience in the health care field also is helpful. Medical assistants who are trained on the job usually spend their first few months attending training sessions and working closely with more experienced workers."<br>  <br>  The handbook also notes, "The earnings of medical assistants vary, depending on their experience, skill level, and location. Median annual earnings of wage-and-salary medical assistants were $26,290 in May 2006. The middle 50 percent earned between $21,970 and $31,210. The lowest 10 percent earned less than $18,860, and the highest 10 percent earned more than $36,840."<br>  <br>  So, yes, you will earn quite a bit more by becoming an RN.

RNqRnG86aa	Most HSA accounts are based on savings accounts with a known, usually low, interest rate. The account needs to be reasonably liquid because you may have to pay health expenses out of the account. If your account is completely in a savings account you will not lose money.    That being said you can choose invest your HSA funds in mutual funds. These mutual funds investments can run the spectrum of extremely low risk such as a prime money market fund to the other end where the fund is investing in small or medium caps, index funds, international funds. As you go higher in the scale of risk you have a greater chance of loss and, at least in theory, a chance to make significantly greater gains.|`|VN5nIY90aa	Nope, it's a savings account. If it's invested in an account at an FDIC-insured bank, it's not going to lose, but only gain through interest accumulation. 401(k) accounts lose because they are invested in the stock market, but they will recover with enough time. If you're looking for a return on your investment with stability, you'll do better to invest in a CD at a bank instead of putting money in an HSA. Plus, there's a penalty for taking money out of an HSA for anything other than medical-related expenses.|`|qBCGH52haa	Yes if you put it in a similar investment subject to the vagaries of the market (stocks, bonds, etc.).  If you plan on actually using the HSA for health expenses, you are better served getting a low risk investment (money market or short-term CD with a good percentage in cash) that is relatively liquid (easily accessed without penalty).    An HSA is not a long-term investment, but rather more of an expense account and you don't want to be in th eposition of having to withdraw funds (say for a needed surgery) when the asset value of your account has decreased.  Unlike a 401(k), in this circumstance you wouldn't have the necessary time to wait out the drop.|`|y2ZukikXaa	YES.  Like anything else it depends on what the assets are in.

YQ1Q7XeEaa	These are behavioral interview questions - they are seeking actual experiences so be sure to tell them about a time when this situation actually happened to you.    Point 2 to remember - every behavioral interview is designed to get you to "fess up" your short comings.  Do not put your head in the noose.    So think back on all of your work history.  Think of a day when you had to solve a problem, prefferably one that wasn't your fault & especially if the solution helped the company.  Tell them the situation, your actions, the POSITIVE results and what you learned from the experience.    For question 2 the structure is the same.  Tell them about a time when you had an angry customer in your face.  How did you deal with it?  If you're smart you pick a time when you were able to help the customer calm down and turn their attitude around by the time it was all said and done.|`|UJ2bDHeeaa	ask a friend or famliy member to role play with you before the interview.  have him/her pretend interview you so you can practice actually answering it.     when i interview candidates, i tell them there's essentially no time restriction, to take their time to think about their answer. there's nothing wrong with that.  i've sat there for up to 2 minutes in silence whlie the candidate was thinking.  eventually i had to move on but point is, dont' be afraid to ask your interviewer for a minute to think about your answer.|`|8xMhLMoRaa	For the first one, you need to tell them about something that had a happy conclusion, such as dealing with a difficult colleague, or a situation in which you found a way to motivate staff working with you. They like to know how you get on in a team in this kind of job so relate this back to the people you have worked with rather than customers or outside people.    For the second question, tell them how a customer complained and you made it your personal task to cope with what happened afterwards. This is all about how you personally deal with conflict so make sure you describe what you did and not what the whole team did. No matter what happened, make sure you put a positive spin on the situation.    If you can not think of examples that fit those things, you could be creative and describe a situation that perhaps didn't actually happen, but tell how you would've dealt with it. Just don't tell them you made it up! Good luck, I hope you get the job!|`|8c56135cd4589e0631905a4f324f3f20aa	I have been through a billion interviews and it's good to prepare, but don't overdue it so your answer seems rehearsed and not natural.  For one when you do have a problem come up at work, you don't get time to rehearse it.  So they like that you can think on your feet.      Think of anytime you have faced a problem and how you deal with it.  Any kind of problem.       2 Dealing with difficult people...how do you on a daily basis at anytime?      They want to know you are going to be independent and deal with things without going to a manager.  At the same time not making people mad so they will come back to shop again.  It's all about the business of anykind making money...think about that.      Good luck and just be yourself!!!

What I don't think that Obama and the Democrats understand, is that the banks that have tried loan modification found out that the a good portion of the people fell behind within a year and they had to foreclose on these properties anyway.  The way that Obama is looking at doing this is to give out tons of "free" money to the financial institutions to reduce the value of these mortgages.

If you think it will continue to fall I suggest you go defensive and pick stocks with a low beta.  The beta is the measure of the stocks movement in relation to the whole market so if the market picks up a high beta stock should most likely pick up more than the market as a whole and vice versa if the market goes down.
ozWi3TJlaa	She may have lied to you to scare you, but the fact is that many companies can and do track the computer usage on their equipment.  That's one of the reasons they have an IT department or at least an IT person.<br>  <br>  To answer your additional information question:  once it's on the hard drive, erasing your history and cookies just makes it harder to get to for the average person.

Delete your history and cookies all you want, its still on the main servers, and still accessible by the company. <br>  <br>  It is best to NEVER EVER use company resources for personal use. this includes checking personal emails, looking at ebay, or participating in online message boards. <br>  <br>  While your employer may not care now, if they decide to layoff employees, or decide they simply do not want you as an employee anymore, your internet usage IS A BASIS FOR TERMINATION.<br>  <br>  Instead of going online when it is slow (no matter how tempting), look for other things to do- offer to work on a special project, ask for more responsibilities, start cleaning if all else fails. That way, if the company DOES hit hard times and needs to lay off employees, you are less likely to be affected. <br>  <br>  It will also demonstrate your dedication and desire to be with the company!

Based on what your "very good credit" is, and based on how much you have for downpayment, you will get a mortgage interest rate.  Your payments will depend on that %.  Your payments will alos depend hugely on how much your down payment is, since that will decrease the amount of the loan.<br>  <br>  Examples -<br>  <br>  Given an interest rate of 5.5% (with very good credit, you should be able to get at least that)<br>  <br>  A downpayment of -<br>  20% = $41,980 will give you a monthly payment of about $950<br>  3.5% (FHA) = $7,346.50 will give you a monthly payment of about $1150<br>  <br>  This is a very broad range, and should give you an IDEA what to expect to pay, and is by no means 100% accurate.

IdQbFUnmaa	well actually nobody can assure top ranking on Google or Yahoo, SEO companies can temporarily take you to the top ranking but if the search engine changes its policy, your ranking will lost and you won't be able to find your website even in top 20 results... the best way to optimize your website is to build natural link which people of other website and blogs willingly give to you... and nobody can pay for the ranking to the yahoo or google, you can get the advertisement on top of the search results through Pay-Per-Click which is an another process of paid marketing...|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's the definitive tutorial from Google.com on how SEO really works:<br>  <br>  The most effective way to advertise on the Internet is<br>  to first set up a website and publish its domain name<br>  on major search directories such as Google.com,<br>  Yahoo.com [at <a href="http://www.google.com/addurl/?......" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/addurl/?......</a> and<br>  MSN.com since 85% of Internet shoppers rely on these<br>  search directories to provide them with goods and<br>  services. In a sense, these search directories are a<br>  very large Internet Yellow Pages.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, should your website or opening webpage<br>  fail to contain "generic" keywords, then anyone using<br>  such "generic" queries will not be able to discover<br>  your website. Your domain name [URL] of your website,<br>  in a sense, will be invisible, undiscoverable.<br>  <br>  You may want to consider some simple algorithms which,<br>  when observed and committed in designing of a website<br>  with placement of various critical metatags that can<br>  surely achieve a high search engine presence and<br>  increase Internet traffic to your website. These<br>  metatag strategies work well with published webpages<br>  at Google and Yahoo.<br>  <br>  Design: Should you create an extensive Flash-based<br>  website, make sure to fill-in the property entries<br>  such as the Title, Description and Keywords. Failing<br>  to do so, leaves no hard HTML or ALT resource that can<br>  be readily indexed by search robots. Also consider the<br>  Internet audience and their incoming setup. For<br>  example, if they are on analog/dialup, Flash webpages<br>  take too long to load up and therefore analog users<br>  will likely lose interest and discontinue entering the<br>  Flash site. On the other hand, anyone on hi-speed DSL<br>  lines, will welcome Flash pages which load quickly. So<br>  before designing a pure Flash websitge, ask the simple<br>  question, "Who's my end user - is he on dialup or<br>  DSL?" And if you had to choose between these two users<br>  for maximum marketability, then select analog users<br>  since 80% of most resident users are still analog<br>  Internet subscribers and pure HTML designed webpages<br>  is best for them.<br>  <br>  A non-Flash-based website which relies on hard text,<br>  is far easier to be indexed by search robots. Limit<br>  the use of stylized text saved as .gifs since as a<br>  graphic, they are not indexable by search robots.<br>  <br>  Avoid use of frames since any number of search robots<br>  are unable to properly classify textual material.<br>  <br>  Placement of Metatags:<br>  <br>  A ranking or search order does take place with Google<br>  and Yahoo and it begins with the "Title" metag which<br>  should consist of no more than 65 characters separated<br>  by commas. The "Title" should describe in generic<br>  terms, the goods and services, followed by a location<br>  from which the resource is located, i.e., city, state.<br>  The placement of a domain name which is not generic<br>  within the "Title" is not appropriate, unless your<br>  domain name is a major recognizable brand name.<br>  <br>  The second metatag is the "Description" which is<br>  usually 25-30 words to form a complete sentence which<br>  best describes one's goods and services.<br>  <br>  And the very last category - "Keywords" are also<br>  somewhat limited to 15-16 words which can be plural<br>  and compound in nature. Again, avoid multiple entries<br>  which could be mistaken as "spamdexed entries" which<br>  is defined as the loading, and submission of<br>  repetitive words into a particular metatag category.<br>  "Spamdexing" when discovered on a webpage and reported<br>  to Google's spamreport.com can result in the<br>  elimination of your website from their search<br>  directory.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|4d3Ie5lCaa	Am gonna repeat what the good old Albert Einstein once said<br>  <br>  "If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?"<br>  <br>  Here is what am 100% sure are the most important factors measured by search engines not in any particular order.<br>  <br>  1.)The "<title>" tag ( don't use the same title tag, use words that you want to get your site known for )<br>  <br>  2.)The quantity and quality of the content<br>  <br>  3.)URL's. Make them nice and neat, none of that  "?id=xxx&st=XYX&pg=567"<br>  <br>  4.)Relevant links to your site with words that are relevant to the page they are linking to.<br>  <br>  Google "seoquake" and "seomoz", you'll find some tools and learn some techinques.<br>  <br>  Also checkout use google's many tools, I like "Analytics" , "Insights for search" and "Alerts".|`|NbDljAKtaa	Hello!<br>  <br>  SEO can be simple and/or complicated - your choice.

FddLQDaGaa	BPO stands for business process outsourching<br>  <br>  and KPO stands for knowledge process outsourching.<br>  WHILE OUTSOURCING is present in numerous business functions, including manufacturing, legal, financial and human resources, it is the term BPO (Business Process Outsourcing) that is largely in the news on a daily basis. India's capabilities in this area have been moving towards enhancing the nature of the work done. From mere data entry kind of work, the fosus has shifted to transaction processing. Now, there is a nascent move towards knowledge process outsourcing (KPO). <br>  <br>  Unlike in BPO where the focus is on executing standardised routine processes, KPO involves processes that demand advanced information search, analytical, interpretation and technical skills as well as some judgment and decision making. Examples of KPO functions are intellectual property or patent research, R&D in pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, data mining, database creation, and a range of analytical services such as equity research, competitive intelligence, industry reports and financial modelling. Many of these activities lend themselves to remote execution from anywhere. <br>  <br>  Typical users of KPO services include market research and consulting firms, investment banks and financial services institutions, industry associations, media, publishing and database firms, and corporate planning departments of large Fortune 500 companies. Several global players such as McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, Reuters, IMS Health, Harris Interactive, Ipsos, Maritz, AC Nielsen, TN0S and the WPP group are already using India as a remote base. <br>  <br>  The KPO Value Chain <br>  <br>  <br>  Typically, the extent of offshoring is a function of the degree of e-enablement possible and the quality of the human capital required. Some activities such as paralegal and medical transcription require low quality human capital as compared to activities such as data mining and analysis, engineering design and e-learning. The latter are also highly amenable to IT enablement. Other services such as legal consulting, intellectual property research and strategic consulting require the highest level of human capital and are the least amenable to IT enablement. <br>  <br>  A veritable gold mine <br>  <br>  <br>  Companies in the KPO space thus need to make the transition from offering services that require low human capital quality and low IT enablement to those that require a high degree of human capital and IT enablement. The National Association of Software and Service Companies projects that the total global offshoring market opportunity by 2008 will touch $141 billion. Of this, data search, integration and management will account for $18 billion. Medical, legal content and associated services represent an opportunity of $2 billion. However, Scope e-Knowledge Center estimates that only 45-50 per cent (about $65-70 billion) of the total off-shoring opportunity is likely to be realised even by 2010. According to Scope, the global offshore BPO (non-IT) revenue in fiscal 2003 was close to $9 billion and this is expected to grow by about 35 per cent a year through 2008. <br>  <br>  An obvious advantage of BPO is the immediate cost savings (over 30 per cent) and yet a steadfast focus on high quality standards. This also allows the in-house team (of the overseas client) to focus their expertise on more value-added work while delegating the lower-end work to more cost-effective resources. For India, it is a new job creator. It is estimated that the total number of jobs created so far as a result of outsourcing, primarily call centre operations, is about 180,000. Of these, the U.S. and the U.K. together have a share of over 86 per cent. By 2010, the share of non-call centre outsourcing is placed at 50 per cent of the total number of jobs created. One estimate places the KPO jobs alone at over a quarter of a million by then. <br>  <br>  At the same time, companies abroad are sceptical about outsourcing high-end services for varied reasons such as data security, quality and professionalism in a remote location, political and regulatory climate. <br>  <br>  Collaborative approach <br>  <br>  <br>  Clearly, this is an evolutionary process and certain roadblocks that exist need to be taken care of. Companies need to adopt a collaborative approach to tackle such issues. For instance, Scope has addressed these issues by adopting a relationship-based model. In this model, concerns on quality and timeliness have been addressed by Scope through a process of pilots and phased transfer of work. Technology — hardware and software — is world class. International certifications such as ISO and BS7799 also help. Likewise, Service Level Agreements that are mutually fair have been put in place. <br>  <br>  What helps the India case is the ready access to a large intellectual pool with expertise in areas such as research and analysis, not to mention reasonable English language skills (that need honing) and strong domain expertise. <br>  <br>  But finally, it is the management that plays a vital role in enabling the smooth operationalisation of such remote knowledge partnerships. <br>  <br>  There is tremendous potential in the KPO space. Only companies that have a strong pedigree, domain expertise, clear focus on the high-end space, a proactive solution orientation and a collaborative mindset will emerge as the winners.|`|AA11173563	BPO is a brokers price opinion based on comparable sales.

snh9wzpnaa	Unfortunately it isn't that easy.  You will get your $75K back tax free but you will get it slowly each year.  You should get a 1099-R declaring how much you were paid in 2008 (box 1) and how much of it was taxable (box 2).  If they leave box 2 blank, then it is up to you to figure it out.  The way to figure it out is talked about as the Simplified Method in publication 721 that you can download here: <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p721.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p721.pdf</a><br>  <br>  It might be a good idea to have a professional do your taxes this year, at least to get this started off right.

ikXRqWxUaa	these places are 99 percent scams.  even if the debt is already paid off, the delinquency will be on your credit report for 7.5 years.  the only thing that is going to make that come off is time and/or a "pay for delete" agreement w/ the creditor.  most revolving debt holders have little interest in doing this, but you might have better luck securing one from medical or utility related debt.  being that you've already paid off the debt, this is moot as you no longer hold any leverage.<br>  <br>  FYI:  what ratdaddy is describing is debt settlement, not credit repair.  those are two different animals entirely.  personally, i would avoid either of them.|`|3rNmjabGaa	There's a difference between credit repair and debt settlement.<br>  <br>  Credit repair services challenge the negative items on your credit report and attempt to remove them.  we are basically enforcing the Fair Credit Reporting Act for you.

Actually, they have nothing to do with your credit report or score, regardless of what they might advertise<br>  <br>  I was 19k in debt but still making payments. My score was still good, but my debt ratio was too high, most of my cards were almost maxed out with a lot of borrow from one to pay the other off. <br>  <br>  All they do is send a letter to your creditors and based on pre-neogociated rates, they reduce your interest and payment. The hitch is that you must claim all of your debts and you cannot continue to use your cards. The companies will shut them off if you are enrolled. But, to take a $3,500 Discover Balance with a 19% interest rate down to 0% and having all of your payment going towards principal is great. <br>  <br>  Your report will reflect that you are in debt counseling, but that is 100X better than having a bankruptucy. Once you are free and clear, you can begin to re-establish credit and try again.

Essentially- it's to close a lot of loopholes that would otherwise exist.<br>  <br>  The best thing she can do if she wants the transfer to be simple and as inexpensive as possible is to set up a trust.

Add sisters name only.  This is the new deed.  Print it out and take it to a notary  Have sister sign it in front of the notary - the document will now be notarized and official.

You will be passed over since they will hire someone that is qualified for it.  Experience and skills are what employers are looking for.  It cost money to train someone to do a job and in today's economy that is not feasible for a company to do since they are cutting costs.  If you have no qualifications, don't waste your time or the companies.   You will only get very low paying jobs by doing nothing more than labor jobs and you can't support your self on minimum wage.

7xk2N7xJaa	Definitely 'too big to fail'. 'Recession proof' means - when it is true, anyway - that the company has taken measures to protect its revenue streams and capital in the event of a downturn (i.e. diversification, or international operations), or if by the nature of its business it does well in such situations. Wal-Mart is an excellent example of a recession proof company, because it sells a wide range of necessities at low prices, people will spend money in Wal-Mart's stores whatever the economy is doing. Even now, Wal-Mart is actually hiring and opening stores - in particular I heard recently about an effort to open five stores in the Chicago area, a $120 million investment. If a company says it is recession proof but it is not, the company will likely fail when a recession comes.<br>  <br>  'Too big to fail' is the notion that a particular enterprise is SO important to the economy that it can't be allowed to fail and suffer the consequences of bad investment decisions. This is dangerous because it opens the door to the government throwing huge piles of money at them to keep them from going out of business.<br>  <br>  As we've seen, that's exactly what happens. Not only does this encourage the banks to continue making bad decisions ('if you lose money, we've got you covered'), and also encourage government to muck about in businesses it doesn't understand (zomg private jets!) the most important consequence is that YOU are on the hook to keep the banks' feet out of the fire. Welcome to Keynesian economics.|`|AA11598210	~~In my opinion it is "too big to fail". We have had devastating consequences to disprove this fallacy!~~|`|AA11305474	Actually, in light of recent history, the words "too big to fail" scares me and procures panic because I immediately associate the words, bailout and huge deficit and eventual tax increases...And, as far as I am concerned, recession proof is a fantasy.

Nine of Cups (Happiness): Contentment and satisfaction in romance, friendship, or other relationships. Achieving your deepest desires and savoring beauty and sensual pleasures. A state of joy and abundance radiating fulfillment and bliss.    The card on the left represents emotion - the feelings aroused by or surrounding the ideation of the project that takes place in the previous card. This is the music or scent of the undertaking. Six of Cups (Pleasure): Opening your heart to the simple pleasures of life. Fond memories fuel the playful embrace of love and life. Experiencing the joy of youth and sexual innocence. Engaging in acts of gentle kindness. Harmony of natural forces without effort or strain. Meeting an old friend.    The card on the bottom represents thought - the analytical process of organizing the project and capturing the emotional content of the previous card. This is the science or vision of the undertaking. Four of Cups (Luxury): Being surrounded by love and devotion but taking it for granted. Ignoring the real and longing for the indefinable. Apathy and disengagement from the world. Dissatisfaction with the condition and direction of affairs, but the inability to accept new opportunities.

ImgouTRIaa	That is unique to each individual situation.  What might fly in Montana, might not go as well in The Golden State of Socialist California. That might sound like a small issue, at this point, but it won't be funny if you violate state and federal law, and judges take a dim view of ignorance to the law, especially where it concerns firearms. I believe , by your asking you are a novice, or a completely inexperienced individual, so just going out and buying a gun at another's suggestion is going to be an exercise in making mistakes, maybe even very regrettable ones. Get to a firearms instructor , and explain your intent, get set up to try various firearms before you buy anything, as it is, you may decide against doing this at all!

3xGn8XX9aa	Before we weren't supporting illegal aliens and volumes of welfare recipients who abuse medicare assistance.  Before, doctors made home visits and actually had a patient/dr. relationship.  before, a doctor had an office and maybe a nurse, often his wife and things were simple and not run like a business supporting a doctors office, a billing office and duplication of positions in both offices.  Before, if you didn't have insurance you could barter for payment.  I had a dental bill in excess of the cash I had and bartered the balance for housecleaning until the agreed amount was worked off.  Before, medicine was not a business.  I recently found out that some companies that offer health insurance to their employees use health insurance companies like BC/BS to administrate for them creating a third party.  Medicare sets the standards for the cost of procedures, visits, medication, etc.  The company you work for must follow the guidelines; they decide what will actually get paid in the end above and or beyond what the insurance company is authorized by medicare to pay out.

Having lots of small jobs when you are really young doesn't hurt.  Problem is when you are young it's sometimes hard to find a job you really want to do since you don't have a degree.  Like I want to become a software engineer but I don't have a BA in computer engineering.  But you can start by working at a computer store or fixing computer problems for people you know.

They might have told what the company policy is about firing, but if they have no reason to consider you to have changed - why would they consider re-hiring you?|`|ZPmqYNuwaa	Other companies may hire you, it's worth trying at least so you don't have to sit around waiting for 3 months.

I had the same thing, and I had a counselor to help me.  I'm a charm now :)   You CAN change your attitude!  Just give it a chance.  Get someone to help you out personally that isn't going to be weak and give up on you!    You're probably going to want a fresh start at a different job....|`|AA11447210	Violent people are typically not desirable employees. WM may or may not hire you back, but I'm not sure they can reveal why you were fired to other companies you apply with. Those companies would likely want to know why you are no longer with WM however.    Instead of using "I was born that way" to excuse your behavior, get counseling. That's along the line of obese people blaming their size on genetics and not what they put in their mouth. It may in part be some of the issue, but bottom line is that a lot of it is choice. You may find it difficult to control your anger, but I seriously doubt it's impossible and with professional help you may be able to get it completely in hand.    I suggest you take action to remedy the situation before it negatively affects more aspects of your life than you've already listed. Good luck!|`|eJgEYi8Waa	It might help the rehire (or getting another job) if you can say you had an anger managment class, or "I learned that . . . (something constructive and positive)"    Also, certain drugs, (nicotine, for example) have a side effect of increasing anger.  Even if you were born that way, you might try to avoid things that make it worse.

You are responsible for making sure they get the right meds at the right time. You are responsible for the safety and well-being of your patients and you must be aware of any changes that might occur on your shift. If you are lucky you will be able to discuss with the patients' doctors and understand the plan of care. In nursing school you will learn an awful lot about nursing diagnoses, but in real life that doesn't come into play too much.

3yrpDNavaa	The lease runs with the property.  The new owner buys subject to your existing lease.  That means the new landlord cannot change the terms.  Of course, you are free to negotiate a new lease with the new owner if you wish, but you are not required to do so.    Caveat:  The new owner must be notified of the lease before the sale closes.  You may want to contact the agent handling the sale to be sure he knows about the lease.    Note:  The above answer from the paralegal is incorrect.  A "foreclosure" will in most instances terminate a lease, because the mortgage lien is normally recorded before the lease is effective, which means the mortgage is superior to the lease.  But a lease is not terminated when title is transferred.  Like an easement, a covenant, or a mechanics lien, or whatever, a lease does not disappear just because there is a new owner.|`|Sn2QeSgWaa	paralegal is incorrect. Mr. Placid and others telling you that the lease transfers to the new owners is correct. The old owner must give the new owner your security deposit.     Only a foreclosure can wipe out the lease.     You might want to record your lease at the county clerk so it becomes public knowledge and/or inform the agents involved so they have to disclose it. However, this happens all the time. If the new owners want the house to live in, they will need to bribe you to leave. Your terms stay the same and they can't do anything to kick you out unless you violate the lease. In some cases, the owner asks you to sign a Tenant Estoppel Certificate to give to the future new owner.     Good Luck|`|GvvhTFCFaa	No you can stay because of you contract|`|OXohgDoJaa	Yes, new landlord new terms, new lease.|`|1ALywdM7aa	i would sign a new lease, the contract was for you and the former owner.

GET A NEW LEASE!!!!!|`|RZzMse3Haa	You have many wrong answers here- so many people that come on here do not know the laws.  anyway......      The new owner must honor your lease.  They cannot require that you sign a new lease and they cannot change anything in your lease.    You do NOT get the deposit back from the old owner and then pay to the new owner.  The old owner must pass that to the new owner.  This is all between them and you really have nothing to do with the bulk of the process.|`|AA10426129	Well you have no say so in anything. Since the Lease was with the old landlord the new one can evict you, change the amount of rent you pay or shorten the terms. Its all up to him. You can't do anything about it since you are only a renter not a homeowner.|`|UoE9cmFsaa	Depending on which state you live in, laws are applied differently.  So check with your local state laws.    GENERALLY, that is illegal.  When you sign a lease, it is a contract between you and the current landlord, promising HE/SHE is allowing you to stay in exchange for X amount a month for rent for one year.  Now, did you find this out after 3 weeks it was sold or before it was sold?  If you sign the lease and the owner never mention it being sold, it is under false representation and the contract is automatically null.  Meaning: You and your roommate can gtfo while you can!    Whatever this landlord and the next agreed, DO NOT BELIEVE HIM. A contract such as this applies landlord to tenant, not third party (maybe in some states, but like I said, this is the General Rule).  Do not trust him.      This is becoming a common problem all over because of the foreclosures and mortgage issue.  Landlord signs lease with tenant, take security deposit/rent bails out on tenant, tenant must vacate premises because of foreclosure or new owner.    P.S. I am a Paralegal for a Personal Injury Law Firm, but like i said, this is what I know and not something I'm advising you to do. If you think you're in too deep, go seek an attorney.      **EDIT** My reply to the last post about my answer being incorrect:  Read above, I stated I am a Paralegal for Personal Injury, not Real Estate or Contract law.  And what I know of is General Knowledge from what I learned by other attorneys or paralegals, but don't quote me what I said.  And secondly, I did say that laws are different state by state.      So for that whoever it was that said that, l2readmypostbetter|`|LrXxwtj3aa	If you do end up staying there and you have a new landlord, make sure you address the security deposit.  You would want to get the deposit back from the old landlord and pay it to the new one.

If you had a serious medical issue and could produce proof from a doctor or hospital, that's one thing but outside of that (and at this point, if you produced it they would think you had a friend make it up, otherwise you would have produced it immediately), there's not much you can do to repair your image with the company.

I am thankfull I should always have a job (maybe not one I like, but it is a job) . My cousin has 4 kids and had her OT cut, then cut to 4 days a week and now laid off for a week (hopefully that is all). She works in a factory making the refridgerators at the end  of the check out lanes. Her job may not be there and how in the hell is she supposed to keep a roof over her head and feed her kids with no income. Her husband works, but they are always having a hard time keeping up with the bills.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is that I think we all should cut back on luxeries and unnecessary spending. People should stop and ask themselves "Do I really need the newest DVD, Wii game, Big screen tv or cell phone?" before spending the dough. They also should quit using credit cards on crap that is not a necessity and live within thier means, (Cable or satellite tv and high speed internet are luxeries, not necessities)  I am getting a good refund on my taxes and will pay off some of the money I borrowed from dad to pay for a new furnance ( mine had flames shooting out of it). and save the rest.

rzS7fc99aa	If you are just looking for more time to pay because you aren't able to work for the next few months, the best option could just be negotiating with your creditors to make reduced payments. You would need to draw up a budget sheet showing what you've got coming in income and what's going out on essentials (rent or mortgage, council tax, gas, electric, housekeeping etc), then you divide up whatever is left among your creditors on a pro-rata basis to show you are treating them fairly.    Write them letters with copies of your budget sheet and start making the paymnets you are offering. Ask them to freeze interest and charges at the same time. You can find a guide to all this, together with sample letters to creditors on www.nationaldebtline.co.uk You can also ring to speak to one of their advisers on 0808 808 4000. National Debtline is a charity, simlar to the CAB.    I wouldn't bother telephoning the credit card companies - keep it in writing.

Any Federal Estate Taxes that are due for an estate valued at more than $3.5 million are paid by the estate before the estate is disbursed to the heirs.  <br>    As to the Indiana State Inheritance Tax.  There are differing tax rates depending on the heirs' relationship to the deceased.  If the heir is related lineally (parent, child, grandchild) there is a $100,000 exemption.  So there would be no tax due on a $10,000 inheritance.  However if the heir is a sibling (or niece, nephew), then the exemption would only be $500.  The tax rate is 7% on the first $100,000 after that so the tax on a $10,000 inheritance would only be $665.00.  If the heir is not related to the deceased at all (except the spouse) then the tax is a flat 10% with no exclusion or $1,000.<br>    Yes, you can pay any taxes due out of the $10,000.  You don't have to come up with the tax money first to get the inheritance.

NCZK0QyGaa	If a homeowner suffers a complete loss of a principal residence and collects insurance proceeds in excess of the adjusted basis in the house, such excess is gross income. However, under Section 165(h)(2)(B) a net personal casualty gain for a given year is a capital gain. If the home was held over one year, the gain is a long-term capital gain. Furthermore, if the taxpayer's long-term capital gains for the year exceed short-term losses, the excess is a "net capital gain" subject to a maximum tax rate of 28% under Section 1(h). The homeowner may, however, defer the gain by investing the insurance proceeds in another home or rebuilding.

They give you them money for a building.  They ship you all the materials (food, tools, stoves, ect.) that you'd need.  Then you use that to get started, then you have to buy the food and all that from the company.<br>  Others, you'll need to get a small business loan, so you can get the building, and some of the materials.  Then the company might still ship you the food for free.  To get you started.<br>  Going to the website of the franchise you want, is your first step.  Any place that offers franchise opportunities (McDonalds, Burger King, Starbucks, ect.) will have a special link for that.<br>  <br>  Pick ones that would be good for where you live, and isn't around.  For instance, I'm not going to make any money where I live if I opened any fast food restaurant.  They're every where.

pCEA7Pu8aa	I would not say that buying a short sale home is the worst way but there is no doubt about it it does take time.    Hopefully when you made you offer it was low enough that by the time the accept it it is still a good deal.    If you are trying to buy the house without the owner involved that is nearly impossible and you will have to wait until it gets foreclosed on.    Generally it will take a bank 3-4 months to process a short sale.  It also depends on how cooperative the seller is with his personal information.  If he does not give it or takes his time the bank just takes their time.    Personally I think that some of the best deals out there are short sale because you are getting it before it is foreclosed and because of that the bank did not have to spend additional $40,000-$50,000.  If you make a good offer and show why they should sell to you sometimes you can get them to pass some of that savings on to you.    Good Luck and if you have the time be patient.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	HAVE YOU TALKED TO YOUR REAL ESTATE AGENT?|`|EXJfoGtAaa	Unless you offered full price the bank is "shopping" the offer.

You just get an endless run around from the bank employees. They don't know what they are doing insofar as real estate is concerned and have no concept of "time is of the essence." I hope your offer contained a time frame for them to respond.    I suggest you get out there and look for another house in the same price range and when you find it withdraw your offer on the short sale and make an offer on the new property. Eventually the short sale property will sell but you have to decide if it is worth waiting for or if you need to move on with life and let the bank keep their house.|`|TpMvr1pyaa	i am betting you do not have a buyer's agent representing you  [and never ever let an agent that reps you do DUAL agency!]    also call your county treasurer today; ask when their 2009 auction  of tax foreclosure houses takes place or --their tax cert sales  take place.

They will not do principle reductions and if and only if you make a 3 times as much as what they might offer you they might work with you.    Generally we see a year of 1% interest and then a year at 3% then a year at 5% then back to the original interest rate.    This way they are not really losing anything just not making as much.

Neither do I want to smell cigarette smoke not just the smell but the staining it does. I know as I moved into my aunts house in September and I could smell smoke for months. The paintwork here is still stained yellow. Not every one who moves in can afford to redecorate straight away. Make the front of your house tidy and clean looking. Also place a mirror in the hallway to make it bigger. Remember to move things out of site. Less is more. People are viewing a house that they potentially want to live in not what you have in there.

blye7Aqlaa	You should be able to deduct business expenses from a home-based business as long as they directly relate to that business.  So, yes you should state both the revenue and expenses on your tax forms to claim your deductions.  If you expect increased revenue over time, you can do this.  If you really don't expect anything more than $150 per year, you will likely have your deductions kicked out since the IRS will consider this a hobby not a business.  Depends on your situation, but yes, those expenses can be deducted.  Just fill out the business revenue/expense forms with your return.|`|0u6qy9Uuaa	It sounds like maybe some of those costs might be for items that should be capitalized and depreciated over 5 yrs instead of expensed in the first year - any expensive equipment or furniture would be that type of item    it they are just legitimate expenses, and you are in teh 25% tax bracket, the business loss could save you $900 on your taxes -> bigger refund|`|r2oZpqm1aa	Yes, you can claim them, but make sure you have excellent records/receipts.  Having that many expenses with little revenue can be an audit flag.  I agree with the other answer posted here in that if this continues the IRS will consider it a hobby and you won't be able to claim the deductions.|`|6sTsIH05aa	It is with a doubt worth it!    One of the great advantages of owning and operating a home business are the expenses you are able to claim as deductions.    But here's the thing, you MUST keep GOOD records and retain all receipts.    You will be able to claim the $4000 worth of expenses on Schedule C of Form 1040.    The IRS stipulation for legitimate deductions are the home business enterprise must be operated with the sole purpose of gaining an income/profit.  If it isn't, the IRS deems it a hobby which renders any expenses null and void.    Warning: An exorbitant amount of expenses compared to revenue over a number of years can trigger a red flag for an audit, so be careful.    The business loss that you will incur in your case here, will result in a gain for you when your adjusted gross income is calculated. Meaning a larger refund for you.

The second company also assumes all risk and liability for exercising the license.    True) This is a guess on my part. If I owned a multinational company, I would want to make sure that I retain ownership of it. This might require that I have to back its launch, growth and development entirely on my own. If I were to take on investors or funding from within my adopted country, it stands to reason that I could risk losing control of my business to companies or investors outside my own country.
AA12065007	Once accounts go to collections the damage has already been done and the only way to raise your score by paying them is to get them to give you a pay for delete agreement which simply says that in return for your payment they agree to remove the account from your credit.    Without this agreement the only thing that will change is the collection will show as paid with a $0 balance and you will actually lower your score when you pay because as soon as you do the accounts become current rather then old.    Needless to say don't pay a dime without this agreement in writing.    As far as restarting the time that the account can be reported that simply will not happen no matter what you do.

The best way to do this if you have money to pay off your debts is to figure how much money you spend on everything per month and come up with a plan to tackle either the highest interest debts first or the smallest and roll the payments into your next one as you pay off your debts.  If you can not currently make all of the minimum payments and don't see this getting better in the future, I would file for bankruptcy.|`|5BTKscZraa	Red flags for any company:    *  The want a large up front payment before any services are provided  *  They want you to wire transfer money to them before any services are provided  *  They want direct access to your checking account  *  Their website has a POB box address  *  There is no working phone number   *  There is no quick way to reach a real human at the company...i.e. all contact is via email.

I'm sure you have the advertising budget to cover it. <br>  <br>  However, in your case, I highly recommend something more cost effective:  an online press release.  <br>  <br>  PRweb.com is the number paid press release service on the internet.  From $80 - $360 one time fee per press release, your site will get exposure to 40,000 premier online websites such as entrepreneur.com.<br>  <br>  Since you seem to have the ad budget for it, get the full $360 package. You will be able to track the number of clicks to your site plus attach videos, photos, the works. <br>  <br>  You can write the press release yourself, or for an extra fee, PRWeb's writers can write it for you.  <br>  <br>  I think this would give you the best exposure for your money, more so than a PPC campaign.  You can do both, if you wish.

They only withhold refunds for past due child support, defaulted federal student loans, and of course if you owe federal back taxes from previous years.|`|tMEUPBo4aa	From what I understand ... Correct. Federal should NOT be withheld. IRS doesn't withhold "private" obligations such as bill collectors and private debts that are owed. Now if you owed the US Gov monies, then yes, the IRS would withhold you refund - but only what is owed, such as: Outstanding Federal Student Loans, Outstanding IRS Tax Debt, etc.<br>  <br>  The Hospital/State medical insurance you owe money to may be State/County owned or funded, in which the state is obligated to withheld monies owed from you State tax refunds.
AqVKFaaGaa	2 mains reasons that I can see - you have an authorised overdraft (so you have more available than your bank balance), and / or you have some transactions that are planned but not yet recorded (such as direct debits or standing orders due to leave in the next few hours, cheques not cleared...), in which case your available balance can be lower (or higher for a uncleared cheque) than your bank balance.<br>  <br>  And you can also have a combination of both, leaving you with a very strange available balance. <br>  <br>  Either way, you should be able to work out what money you really have by thinking about what you have spent recently (does it all show yet or not), what bills are due to come out and so on. Ignore the 'available' part due to overdraft as it's not really your money and could be recalled at any time.|`|etEG5KrGaa	It could be either the funds aren't posted yet because when you make a deposit it posts at night or they could have put a hold on your deposit.

They may ask you for proof you actually closed. Now, how about some good news. As you know the 7500 credit is actually a loan that has to be paid back. With the recovery act of 2009, the 8k deduction you mentioned, you can actually do an amendment of your 2008 taxes (later) and change from the 7500 credit to the 8k one. YOU WILL GET THE ADDITIONAL 500 AND NOT HAVE TO PAY IT BACK.

AA10368727	City income tax is assessed in some cities, like New York City, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh, to name a few.  Most municipalities do not assess an income tax, though.  Municipal income tax is generally a flat rate, period.  There are no returns to be filed, no deductions, no exemptions, etc.  It's just a flat percentage of your income that goes to the city.  It's generally one rate if you live and work in the city, and another rate if you either live in the city or work in the city but not both.<br>  <br>  Property taxes are assessed (usually by the county - or parish, if you live in Louisiana) for any property owned in that jurisdiction.
