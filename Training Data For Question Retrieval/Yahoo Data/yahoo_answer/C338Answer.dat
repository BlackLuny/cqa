(ie; look how high my % is, I must answer more to keep it this high). ... All in all it's a meaningless tool to control people.<br>  <br>  C: Since you can go back and vote for your own answer as BA, this slants things even more.

hs9Mibf5aa	Hi<br>  <br>  Well I went looking on MySpace for you, and so far he doesn't seem to have a page.  I wouldn't despair though, a lot of them are just beginning to put one up, if they haven't.  This could also be a good sign, as he is playing well.. and doesn't want to 'blab' anything too early, so maybe he's saving it for a bit later!<br>  <br>  I also have him as one of my picks!  He's a "Man's Man".  Just keep checking for a "James Thomas Jr." from Alabama and you'll find him eventually.  And others will 'friend' him.  And you can add me if you want, - I have a lot of them, to check:<br>  <br>  www.myspace.com/canadienne_friend<br>  <br>  C'kins :)|`|47ts5rMTaa	aww he's hot

I assume you DON'T mean the lousy commercial stuff...<br>  <br>  Richie Hawtin<br>  Jeff Mills<br>  Ben Sims<br>  Magda<br>  Cari Lekebusch<br>  Adam Beyer<br>  Dave Clarke<br>  Joel Mull<br>  Marco Bailey<br>  <br>  In this list you'll find everything from hard techno, to minimal techno, Detroit stuff, Belgian stuff, and some experimental stuff. <br>  <br>  Richie Hawtin is the one I would check out first, but don't stop at the first thing you hear. He has a lot of different techno music. <br>  <br>  Here are just a few cool youtube links, just to give you an idea. <br>  <br>  Richie Hawtin:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGVzZqlVh_g&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGVzZqlVh...</a><br>  <br>  Jeff Mills (first of 5 parts):<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bLanIfR13A" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bLanIfR1...</a><br>  <br>  and here's a very cool track by a newer artist named Gary Beck:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN2MqwCH8Lw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN2MqwCH8...</a><br>  <br>  Hope you like these!|`|a0ce061c6f71bad5be9b0364fde03344aa	Try Daft Punk, Justice, Royksopp, Paul Okenfold, The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, Benny Benassi,  Paul Van Dyk, Cassius, Rob Dougan, Tiesto, Sasha, Faithless, Delerium, LCD Soundsystem, Alice Deejay, Basshunter, Blue Man Group, DJ Tiesto, Hellogoodbye, The Black Ghosts.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you.

1769dd56202770e7c935ce5a343521dcaa	I'm Lebanese and I had to post a reply...<br>  - if you take a picture of people walking around Beirut and people walking around Paris, no one will be able to tell the difference, because Lebanese people are known to wear very elegant, beautiful and classy clothes. <br>  - Lebanese people, even taxi drivers, butchers and flower ladies, speak a minimum of 3 languages. Their english might not sound american, but it's correct and cute. <br>  - I think most parents all over the world will brag about their kids, but Lebanese people have a reason to be proud of their kids: they grew up in war time, they missed out on their childhood and they most probably have lost a parent or a relative. Still, they come out to be decent, well educated, caring people.<br>  - In small villages, decades ago, maybe... but now, rarely does this happen. The age average for marriage in women has reached 25. Women now go get an education, travel, start a career and then think of settling. Arranged marriage hardly ever occurs.<br>  - Mensef and eating with your hands is a Jordanian and Kuwaiti method and has nothing to do with Lebanese. Also, this is a cultural tradition that our neighboring countries should be proud of, it's part of their ethos.<br>  - The other points are silly generalizations and I'm sure you have them in your country as well.<br>  <br>  I hope that you learned some important points about Lebanon and that you won't make the mistake of distributing wrong information again.<br>  <br>  Shukran!<br>  <br>  Changed by Lithium|`|IA4x5oPMaa	I'm not Arab but u got this one "You say "bolice" and "beoble" for "police" and "people"

LOXGwXDwaa	This is a very interesting question, I have seen many answered forgetting, I think it's the fact, maybe they're talking about 'memory' lol. Well, I think by the saying; I forgive, but I NEVER forget. It's hard to forget what a 'bad/horrible' thing someone did, although you forgive that person, you know what I mean? Like, there's still a needle between the people. It's not gonna go away, you're gonna remember it. To me, forgiving is easier, I tend to "forgive" people quite easily, many people take advantage of me because of that.|`|54aea8f9c5941d9b20207a96ff5abb64aa	Well, if you forgot to forgive..you really couldn't forget what you were really trying to do by forgiving. Therefore, if you forgave the person before you forgot then it wouldn't be logical to forget in the first place. But if you forgot to forgive then you couldn't forgive the person before nor after you forgot so that wouldn't be logical to forgive. Forgetting it would only make the situation worse by not forgiving, and if you forgave before you forgot you would forget to forget what you had already forgotten to forgive.<br>  <br>  KAPEESH ?|`|8nQ20nO7aa	Maybe forgiving...I can never forget...if it hearts and you did something or something happened and it's important enough or big enough to put a chip in my heart or life then it's a memorable thing. I can forgive and give a second chance but I will remember and never forget the first failure ....the reason for the second shot.|`|2P5WRadhaa	Only God can forgive & forget, As humans, we have trouble forgetting, so, then, we have trouble forgiving.  We must learn and practice forgiveness; so we must learn to "forgive and remember" -(that we have forgiven.)|`|uVTosLc9aa	For me its forgiving. I have never been able to stay mad at anybody.

PK2mFkQ5aa	you have a good point there. I really have no idea what the attraction is, but I do know that for some reason, my girlfriend loves edward more than she loves me...|`|3Q9HcfQsaa	dont think its really the vampire. <br>  its just probably that he is hot and that he is in a good movie. <br>  plus if one girl likes him then every other girl will too..chain reaction|`|fEfNcumxaa	vampires like to suck<br>  <br>  and that last time ive heard, girls like that|`|Ik5qgOunaa	nothinq. unless there weiner is very lonq.|`|DwI2MV53aa	I know what you mean. But I think I've figured it out. They're the only un-human yet human character young female teens have to read and fantasize about and since Twilight is a romance, girls like romance (right?) and since Twilight is the most popular book right now vampires remind girls of their romance novel which is Twilight. (It's ridiculous I know but as every middle aged man say-women)|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	hannibal lechter might! <br>  <br>  Lol, vampires were cool in "interview" but they are so decades ago!|`|qKkTI0jnaa	They are so primal, it's like they could love you one minute & kill you the next, they can also dominate you sexually.

If there is ANYONE attractive in that book, it's the werewolf.<br>  there's something so deliciously primal about him :}<br>  other than that, I really think that whole book is overrated by FAR. really far. I wouldn't reccomend it to anyone over 14.<br>  <br>  the vampire fascination dates all the way back to Nosferatu. you should check it out. you can watch it on Google Videos :]|`|UXze6Qqsaa	i know! wtf...i hate how obsessed everyone in is. get over it. edward cullen is not real...he never will be...<br>  i promised myself no matter what happens that i would never read on of those twighlight books...i shall never sink that low|`|54aea8f9c5941d9b20207a96ff5abb64aa	Omgg, I know right.!?<br>  There is nothing appealing about vampires or this dumb Edward Cullen figure !<br>  <br>  I fully agree.<br>  Nadia A.|`|f6xtzVUDaa	I agree. I think the reason everyone (well not everyone....) like vampires is probably because they are daring and dangerous and not everyone wants something safe...maybe people are looking for adventure.|`|3cGgRo42aa	twilight can go fvck it's mother sideways -.-<br>  point agreed w/u.|`|1634875a2112f90de61c5b890983ed03aa	They are seductive and forbidden.|`|uvICu0gNaa	LMAO!!!!! hahaha you got a point there that is kinda gross that's like saying your gonna do the chicken you're guna eat eeewww..|`|i4SVk2Cpaa	i dont like twilight 'vampires' i like anne rice vamps though :]]|`|Q5EftYrpaa	penis times 4|`|T6PzMyPBaa	it's just a bunch of fat wannabe emo girls who obsess over all that rubbish<br>  it's just a trend.<br>  it'll pass soon enough|`|j6poSs16aa	Nothing at all|`|8pS0oT4faa	they suck blood, some vampire girls are hot|`|ZqDvQprCaa	yes he is!<br>  thats why jacob came into the story :)|`|cSPxoFe6aa	nothing and twilght sucks|`|saQqUUWxaa	yeah i feel the same way|`|wt11tXoRaa	well he made out to be very hot and he is kind to bella and caring. And its just fun to hope for something that you know will never happen it gives you something to do. Another reason for me is because i think that stephenie meyer is a very good author. So yes i am a twilight but i dont LOVE edward i just think he is a good character|`|xoveRPysaa	nothing at all.<br>  because of everyones "omg im so in love with edward cullen and twilight" obsession, it disgust me and made me HATE the books, with out even reading them(:|`|VagRIJlEaa	Vampires just always have that mysterious sex appeal. I mean really, they're rarely portrayed as scary.|`|CTaKjwDTaa	nothing|`|itmpuNHmaa	They are dangerous.  They can take your life or make you live forever at their whim.|`|C6ZJcNJjaa	Nothing.

Symptoms include liver and kidney disturbances and mental retardation.<br>  <br>  Most inborn forms of tyrosinemia produce hypertyrosinemia (high levels of tyrosine).<br>   <br>  Tyrosinemia is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.There are three types of tyrosinemia, each with distinctive symptoms and caused by the deficiency of a different enzyme.<br>  <br>  Type I tyrosinemia <br>  Type II tyrosinemia <br>  Type III tyrosinemia <br>  <br>  Treatment varies depending on the specific type. A low protein diet may be required in the management of tyrosinemia. Recent experience with NTBC has shown to be very effective.

AA10558731	Personally, I think it should be raised to 25. People fresh out of high school are inexperienced and ripe for picking by Democrats who's classic "forked-tongue" tactic is to appeal to uneducated & inexperienced voters with promises that sound good but are impossible to keep. The recent election of Obama is prime evidence of this.|`|192Ys1alaa	Yes, because it takes about 3 years to get through most of the brain washing that the public schools and mass media do to make you vote based on your feelings instead of voting using your head.<br>  <br>  Lower the drinking age because it hasn't worked so far in preventing drinking among 18 - 21 year olds because they actually drink more!|`|1kJgH91Jaa	No. Because, if you are responsible enough in society to have the ability to pay taxes, than you have the right to decide where that money should go.<br>  <br>  And the drinking age should be lowered, because if men and women  under the age of 18 can go off to war and save innocent citizens, and protect our country than they have the right to have a couple drinks to help ease the reality of war.|`|QooHtEC6aa	no, bc if at the age of 18 you can join the military, and do other things, you should have a say in what our government does|`|zmNg5YNQaa	Nope, legal adult age is 18, you pay taxes at 18, so in other words you should have a say in what your paying for, right?|`|3urQfMffaa	hell no. if u could serve in the army, u should be able to vote. Drinking age should also be lowered to 18 IMO.|`|d9iXONYsaa	Either that or lower the drinking age to eighteen.  With some of the yahoos we have had to choose from lately, I need a drink!|`|aU91Xgrraa	Yes because some people are so irresponsible.|`|4kuWOZowaa	NO|`|2p55hLjYaa	no its cool the way it is....|`|j6poSs16aa	no|`|jlHz0Fg1aa	It's fine where it is. If the law defines you as a consenting adult at eighteen, then it should give you priveleges accordingly.<br>  Voting. Drinking, too.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	No. At 18, I am a adult and can be just as educated as someone who is 21. In fact, I know a lot more than my peers.<br>  <br>  The voting age should stay at 18.|`|Jucak0HLaa	No,but I think that the drinking age should be lowered.<br>  <br>  Hey,but that's the good thing about Louisiana.No matter how old you are your parents can buy you a drink,and hand it straight to you.|`|gHR4vlcDaa	NO, lol why should it be? lol I also think EVERYONE 18years+ that is a legal citizen has the right to vote! LOL sexy face,lol you pay taxes when you start working,lol lots of us started at 14yrs 9months :)|`|grifjdr0aa	NFW, old enough to fight for your country you're sure as hell old enough to vote for who gets to decide if you fight.|`|PpWosZsIaa	Not at all, if one is old enough to go to war, they're old enough to vote for their Commander in Chief.|`|AA10350396	I think it should be lowered to 16. Many choices made in this country affect more than those 18 and over. Sometimes the non-tainted opinions of those not affected by political brain-washing, political posturing and family pressures are more refreshing than the " old guard"<br>  <br>  <br>  16!!! Bring it on!|`|WXCa8zQoaa	no because 18 your an adults and that should be a right .they changed it to be 18 because that's when you can get drafted so people thought that if you can get drafted and go fight a war then you can vote|`|0ff2304aa58946a2151ca64e5d9e7cd9aa	I thought it was stupid when they lowered it.  The argument was that if you're old enough to fight for your country, you should be able to vote.  So why not raise the killing age to 21 instead?|`|8q82dLS8aa	no, 18 is considered an adult in the eyes of the law<br>  <br>  if i can go to jail like an adult, i should be able to vote like an adult<br>  <br>  it goes both ways|`|2f8d927b404e673e434c880af431f65caa	I think the legal age for everything should be 21. We are so much more mature at 21 than at 18. 18 year olds tend to make rash and costly decisions.|`|NJtjJA8Baa	No, repealing an amendment would take more work than passing one.|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	I think this along with the driving age. If they can't drink, they cannot vote.|`|XWk7TDYTaa	definitely not
gHGpIFC0aa	not a great joke. lol. but i'll humor you because I love poetry.<br>  <br>  "I can write no stately poem as a prelude to my lay."- The writer believes his writing capabilities aren't wonderful and that before he reaches the climax of the poem, he thinks norhing he writes is good.<br>  <br>  "For is of these fallen petals"-he means of all the poems he's written that haven't seemed good to him.<br>  "One to you seem fair"-meaning of all of his "bad" poetry, if she likes any of it..wait for it.<br>  "Love will waft it till is settles on your hair."-...he will love her endlessly. <br>  <br>  "And when the wind and winter harden all the loveless land"-pretty self-explanatory.<br>  "It will whisper of the garden"-in the mid sec of the poem, he says, "for if of these fallen petals" meaning all of his writing, and then here it says it will "whisper of the garden", and petals being on flowers, flowers being in gardens, hes referring to the garden being all of his writing. so he's saying when winter comes and things get tougher, she will remember this poem and his writing for her.<br>  <br>  at the end, he says "you will understand", meaning that obviously, she will be the only one to ujnderstand the "whispers of the garden."<br>  <br>  its a beautiful poem. now, don't take my word as the real deal, this is only how ii perceive this. :)<br>  <br>  thanks...even tho i was looking for a laugh. lol.|`|5eoO6qosaa	I believe that this is a "introduction" or dedication to his wife about the book of his poems.<br>  <br>  I can write no stately poem<br>  As a prelude to my lay,<br>  From a poet to a poem<br>  I would dare to say.   -  I can write no short romantic composition<br>  <br>  For if of these fallen petals   - Petals are the abstract of leaves<br>  One to you seems fair,           leaves are also the pages of books<br>  Love will waft it till it settles     So he hopes that she likes at least<br>  On your hair.          -               one of the poems.<br>  <br>  And when wind and winter harden  - And when we are old <br>  All the loveless land,                        and things look bleak<br>  It will whisper of the garden,            remember the garden of<br>  You will understand.

One of her juggs seems nice, but the other is hanging all the way down to her crot*ch hair.<br>  <br>  And when wind and winter harden<br>  All the loveless land,<br>  It will whisper of the garden,<br>  You will understand.<br>  -When he is asleep, he passes gas.  That is what wind he is referring to.  It will stink all the way to her nose, because that is the part that smells a garden.

PumYhJSvaa	I thought it had a good story line. I absolutely hated her rotten husband and the fact that she stuck with him most of the movie really irritated me. While I was happy she was having an affair, I wasn't pleased that the doctor was having an affair. As his wife didn't deserve to be cheated on at all. The idea that she was angry with her pregnancy and even went as far as to think horrible things about her child was realistic. When she had the baby and made an instant connection, that was also realistic. Overall I thought it was a great movie. I watched it with the idea that I might not like it, but I ended up enjoying it. <br>  <br>  Oh yes, and the mean old man was a really awesome piece to the story. I have had customers like him and it is amazing how spot on they got that character.|`|oOSNI3wbaa	i think im tired of seeing it on HBO every 5 minutes.|`|ViEgekyIaa	I loved that movie. It was cute and funny. The fact that no character was completely perfect made the story even better. The husband was flawed but so was Russel's character. The guy from Monk cracked me up; he and A. Shelly were cute together. <br>  <br>  It's sad that no more will come from the director, but this was a great movie.|`|5e352a812d7c8557bf819f8eac70367baa	I expected to like it alot more than I did being a huge Filion fan.<br>  I thought it was a bit slow and I didn't really care about Russell's character as much as I hated the husband.|`|Yg2iIneKaa	it was good i hated her husband too.

AHCtDhUcaa	high school rock bands are pretty cool.<br>  it's a lot of fun to be in a band. my friends are on one and they are very good! usually they practice in my friends garage, and once they even played in a party. being in a band is great because it can be a opportunity for the band members and it well make fun memories and the experience is awesome.|`|DwI2MV53aa	Rock and metal high school bands take talent. Punk is usually a bunch of whiney kids who like dying their hair unnatural colors and playing a bunch of the same notes over and over again.

4Xpo2eYLaa	No i'm not glad. I don't particularly care for her tatts either, but that's not what this is about. We're not judging them on their appearance. I think she has a unique, pretty voice and a "real person" kinda vibe coming from her. Her song choices are also uncommon but fit her voice very well. She doesn't strike me as the kind of person that thinks she's all that, which i like about her. Adam Lambert, however is a different story. I can't stand him. HE'S the one that just knew he had it in the bag. He's smug and over confident. His performances are way too dramatic and over-the-top. I'm so tired of looking at his "hey look everybody i'm so sexy" looks in the camera. He makes me want to throw up.|`|uGFzzLYWaa	Not in a mean way, I thought she was okay, but there were better performers than her that went home.<br>  I think that the judges will bring her back as a wild card, though.|`|b029a88ae15db77fd1a2e0bdf6ba404faa	I wasn't judging her on her tattoos.I thought she gave a cute,awkward performace.She was ok but there were other performers who were better than her.I would not have mind to see how she would have done later in the show.I liked the sound of her voice but  other singers had a much powerful and strong vocal than she and showed it in their song.Maybe if the rules hadn't changed and the show was like the previous seasons she  may had a good chance of still being around.<br>  <br>  The funny guy was my favorite.He is hilarious but yet can actually sing.I would have loved to seen him make it.Yet at the same time I think his  comedy caused him to not get in the top 12 but he is still a star.|`|9rz9XJdQaa	eh her voice wasn't too bad, there were just more that were better. and i don't mind her tats either. the think i didn't like about her was when she was preforming she was doing this really awkward dance it was so distracting. i wish she had more of a personality.
8PHOudbXaa	They are generous, friendly, determined, sympathetic and helpful when in a positive state of mind.<br>  When not so positive, they may become a bit bitter, destructive, hateful, conceited, and revengeful.<br>  They like good food and social gatherings (particularly family), but they may not have much patience with their kids particularly the more sensitive ones, and will probably either ignore them,  try to push them hard, or even at times unfairly treat/judge them once too many!<br>  They usually age gracefully and become fine ladies well into their sixties and seventies!|`|Po6dgusAaa	I love them.<br>  Good:<br>  Really Nice and Sweet<br>  They lie but not always to hurt you but to protect you<br>  They are loyal to their friends and never cheap when going out<br>  They are good listeners<br>  Great Partiers and Party throwers!!!<br>  <br>  Bad:<br>  They show off sometimes too much<br>  Over exaggerate over their accomplishments or possessions they dont have<br>  Neutral:<br>  When they ignore you it takes a good while to gain back their trust<br>  <br>  I know many Taurus' females and I can't say that I have anything against any of them|`|DDw6k8JOaa	bABES|`|r4skENXIaa	I often find Taurean females to experience a bad relationship and then they go downhill from there. I've seen more than many who whore themselves out physically, they indulge in physical pleasures. As for the more mature/evolved Taureans, they're very generous and artistic. They're nice and modest people who enjoy peace as long as they're not hungry.|`|HSSuKNCUaa	I'm a Taurus and my stepsis and stepmom are, too :-)<br>  <br>  Positive; we're very loving, we genuinely care about people and once the love is repaid we go through fire for our friends and loved ones. We can be very nurturing and we derive a large part of our self esteem from how we treat others. We never truly intend to hurt anyone, even if we're very angry and think we áre trying to hurt someone, we're harmless. Taurus is probably also the last lady to join any "I hate men" discussion, even after a bad break-up. They're practical and ambitious and very together. Though Taurus can be prone to depression (because they are often mature from a very young age on), you will find Taurus isn't likely to be deeply emotionally unstable.<br>  <br>  Negative; we're very stubborn. Because we are often mature at an early age, we tend to think we know what the world should be and what is right and what is wrong. We grow stuck in the idea that we know what's right at all times, because we were often responsible children and teenagers, even if we rebelled. And even though Taurus will be the last to declare the other sex anything negative in general... once Taurus has been hurt one too many times, they can close up emotionally. Also, when we're angry we just stop talking to people; we feel we're right and discussion is useless and they are likely a waste of time.|`|X3lrPVbKaa	I am a taurus and my really good female friends have been taurus also. We are earthy women who see the beauty in everything. We love nature and respect it. We love good food and all the pleasures of life. We can be materialistic but we work hard to secure our goods. And yes, we are very meticulous. Once, we lose trust in someone it can never be gained back. But we are very loyal and generous to the ones we love.|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	We are awesome who cares what they think|`|QuwDNQTRaa	I love Taurus females, they are loving, funny, and all around good people.  Their determination is admirable and they are extremely loyal.  My mother and aunt are both taurus, so I would think I have an generally accurate description.<br>  <br>  The only bad thing I can think of is that the taurus are sometimes too stubborn, to the point where it's a bad thing.  This goes for males and females.<br>  <br>  Maybe I say that because I'm a Gemini, but idk,  Taurus people in general are cool, have tons of taurus friends.|`|QZzQdh43aa	my best friend is a taurus<br>  she's passive, a great listener, has a good sense of humor and i know i can always depend on her to be there for me whenever i'm feeling down. <br>  she can be very judgmental and hypocritical. she has high standards of people but she tries her best not to judge. she sometimes likes to give me her morality speeches, and honestly, it bores me to death sometimes and just makes me mad because she sometimes does the things she says are wrong of me to do (i.e. judge people)<br>  she loses trust easily, and just recently i lost it so now it's taking forever to get that back. we're not as close as we use to be, but we still communicate in weird different ways like sitting next to each other or hugging|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	very nice but jealous...patient, friendly, understanding, simple, natural, stubborn, lazy, lovesssssssssss to eat, eat, eat, and eat.

vsy4QMHMaa	Because you haven't given us a complete assessment of the condition of the piano, I'll elaborate with some extras at the end.<br>  <br>  Trapwork for the soft pedal on an old upright pretty much consists of the pedal connected a leaver running from the middle of the piano to the left sitting on top of a spring, and a dowel running up to the hammer rail. The worst possible problems are that the spring under the lever is broken, or the wood under the pedals is cracked and the screws came out. All of that wouldn't cost $50 to replace. Often times only the dowel has come off the hammer rail (usually by people opening the front of the piano and playing with the hammer rail by hand.)<br>  <br>  Middle pedal could be one of two things on this beast (assuming a 1900 - 1970s piano): Another connecting rod like the first running to a mechanism to lift the bass dampers. (Most likely) Again, simple and fairly cheap to fix/replace.<br>  or<br>  a mechanism (either cable or trapwork) that pulls down a tack rail between the strings and hammers. (Less likely)<br>  <br>  Getting keys recovered is standard production work, and would cost a few hundred dollars. My guess is if the key tops are that bad, they would also need to get new front-rail bushings, balance rail bushings and several might also need new key buttons.<br>  <br>  Ok, that's the cheap stuff. <br>  <br>  Let's assume this instrument hasn't had the best of lives, and has spent the last twenty or thirty years in a basement, a garage, or a daycare center. All of the action is going to need regulation, possibly new felt al around (keys, dampers, front rail punchings, and all the bushings. Maybe new buckskins for the hammer catchers. I'm also going to guess that at least five treble strings and one or more bass strings are broken. Well, heck, while you're in there you might as well replace all the strings to make it sound new again. (Assuming none of the bridge caps have delaminated or cracked.) While the strings are off, you'll want to have the plate cleaned up and repainted. And with the sparkly clean insides you'll want to have the cabinet refinished. We're rapidly approaching $10,000 here folks ... <br>  <br>  .... how much did you want to put into this piano? <br>  <br>  Many folks have opted to gut pianos of questionable worth, but with pretty cabinetry. They replace the piano keyboard with a digital piano removed from it's case and fitted into the piano's cabinet.<br>  <br>  I'm not a huge advocate of the practice, but the results give you a working instrument that doesn't need tuning in a cabinet that fit's a particular architectural style.|`|AA12376180	Ellington I believe was made by Baldwin. When you say the left and middle pedals are broken, do you mean the actual brass pedals are broken or do you mean that when you press the pedals down, nothing happens differently? <br>  <br>  On most upright pianos the left pedal when depressed pushes the hammers closer to the strings, thus decreasing the travel distance and hopefully makes the sound softer. <br>  <br>  The middle pedal can be made to do a number of different things depending on what the manufacturer had in mind. The most common is dropping a piece of felt between the hammers and the strings to mute the sound. <br>  <br>  Your piano is probably old and you may no longer have a felt strip inside you piano. Very common in older American uprights.<br>  <br>  It is extremely rare to replace the keys on a piano, usually you just put on new key tops. It sounds like your action needs to be rebuilt. This can be costly to do it completely $3000 to $4500. This would include rebuilding the action, leveling and regulation. This alone will probably exceed the value of the piano.<br>  <br>  Talk to your piano tech. He may be able to do a minimum of work just to get the piano to play better for a lot less.<br>  <br>  Unless you have sentimental feelings for this piano, I would not put too much money into it.

It only has 4 pages to it. But it is about a true story found. It was written in Thomas G. Linjonison's diary first and than he showed the world and they rewrote it for copies. It was about his ship ride in 1809. He talked about how he was running from the war to another place. They than were shot by an incoming ship ahead and he wrote the same time he fell out of the boat. He gripped his left arm to the edge of the ship and wrote fast. He tried to pull himself up. Than he saw the other ship ready to shoot another canon and than he swam away. He wrote it on the board he brung with him while swimming away and wrote it all down. He ended his story fast because another ship was ahead of him and he saw the gun. He knew he was dead so he just ended his story and than just pushed it into the ocean with the pencil inside it and than let himself die. He ended his story with, "I see the gun infront of the enormous ship and I lean my hand to the book to write this last time. I am at the end. I hope someone finds this book someday, if they look into the ocean. It is the end." That is where people now put The End at the end of their book. He was the first to do that. He though was talking about himself dying. It was his ending. I looked it up and I remember seeing this on the history channel once. And than I didn't read his book. It is in book stores that have historic books in them. But his copy is in United Nations Museum in Florida.|`|Jj8fJ8x6aa	technically it doesn't matter how many lines of dialogue there are, all action is in a script as well.

9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	tzddean has got it, really.<br>  <br>  You will find that transposing instruments are usually parts of a family. A great example is the saxophone family. There are many saxophones ranging from sopranino down to contrabass (OK, there IS a subcontrabass but I think only one exists!). Now, unless all the instruments in your family are exactly an octave apart from each other, one would have to learn new fingerings each time one picked-up a different member of the instrument family at a different pitch. By making them all READ in C (and, therefore, have the same fingerings for the same read notes), musicians can easily switch between one instrument in the family and another. The clarinet family is another example - there are clarinets pitched in D, Eb, Bb, A, F and C (yes, there IS a C clarinet - it was quite popular in the 19th century - you will find parts for in music by Berlioz, Mahler, Strauss, etc - it didn't catch on because people considered its tone quality inferior to the Bb and A instruments). Imagine having to learn different fingerings for all of those each time you wanted to change to another member of the family!<br>  <br>  In North America, the C trumpet is in common use instead of the bb instrument mostly used in Europe.<br>  <br>  As tzddean says, it's about flexibility and convenience.<br>  <br>  One weird exception to all of this - the recorders. Every alternate recorder has a range upwards from C, while the ones inbetween have a range upwards from F. No-one ever thought of treating the 'F' recorders as transposing instruments and so recorder players DO have to learn different fingerings, depending on which recorder they are playing.<br>  <br>  For every rule there is an exception, it seems!|`|CrAwmz65aa	I interpreted your question three differfent ways, so I'll answer it to the best of my ability three different ways.<br>  <br>  <<<<<Why does a written C on the clarinet differ in pitch from a written C on the piano?>>>>><br>  <br>  No, that's not what you meant, because you said you understood  transposing instruments.<br>  <br>  <<<<<Why is a sounding C on the clarinet differ in tone quality from a sounding C on the piano?>>>>><br>  <br>  I'm afraid that's out of our league.  This question involves fundamentals and overtones.  See if there is a category for Acoustics.<br>  <br>  <<<<<Why can't they build clarinets and trumpets just a little smaller so they will sound in the key of C?>>>>><br>  <br>  I have been wondering about this for a long time.  If they made clarinets and trumpets just a little smaller, that would make life easier for conductors, composers and arrangers, and 'most everybody else.<br>  <br>  But the topic of transposing instruments has nothing to do with the question of acoustics.  C trumpets and Bb trumpets create similar overtones.  Likewise, Bb clarinets and A clarinets create similar overtones.  Intervals create dissonances, not incompatibility of overtones.<br>  <br>  Your additional details weren't quite right.  If a clarinettist played a written C, that would be a sounding Bb.  If the pianist played a written C at the same time, that would be a major second.  You should get a unison if the clarinet played a written D and the pianist played a written C.  If you assigned the same two notes to two Bb instruments or two C instruments, both players would transpose or not transpose the same.  That's why you would get another major second.  Like I say,  intervals create dissonances, not incompatibility of overtones.<br>  <br>  <br>  PS Tzddean, I once saw a Bb piano.  It had been so long since it was tuned that it went a whole step flat.|`|W0qNkROpaa	The fact that they are transposing instruments makes it easier for people to switch from say, a B flat clarinet to an A clarinet without having to change fingerings.  Let's say you were playing a piece on the piano in B flat major and you didn't like all the flats, so you wanted to play as if you were playing in C major.  Then say a "B flat piano" existed, which was set up so that when you struck the note that usually corresponds to C, it sounded as a B flat.  Then you could play your B flat major piece as if it was in C major.  It would be written as if it was in C major, and you would play it this way, but it would sound as being in B flat major.<br>  <br>  It has nothing to do with physics or waves, it's just for convenience for the musicians.  Originally trumpets and horns didn't have valves, so they could only play in one key.  This wasn't practical when playing with other instruments.  If they had to play a piece in say B flat they would add an extra piece of tubing on to their instrument to make a "B flat" instrument and then play away as if they were in C, and it would fit in with everything else.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	Middle C  is C4.  The piano C4 and the B-b clarinet C4 should be the same frequency if both instruments are tuned to A440.<br>  <br>  I'm not a musician, but I play one on Yahoo Answers.<br>  <br>  So, maybe there is something I don't understand here.  If you were to sound C4 simultaneously on the two instruments and they were not exactly the same frequency, you could hear a volume change as the sound waves constructively and destructively interfered with each other.<br>  <br>  Let's say the piano C4 was 261.626 Hz and the clarinet C4 was 262.626 Hz.  You would hear a pulsating sound with a period of one second.  Do you hear that?<br>  <br>  When you say that, "it does not sound like a C on a piano," do you mean  that to your ear, they sound different?  If that is the case, I'd say that your ear is an unreliable measure of their relative tunings and you are being fooled by their differing timbres.  The thing to listen for is constructive-destructive interference!<br>  <br>  ADDENDUM<br>  Matt, <br>  Apparently with my not being a musician, this is something I don't know  anything about!<br>  <br>  ======================================...<br>  ANOTHER ADDENDUM, Friday, 2-27-09, 9:43 p.m. EST<br>  ======================================...<br>  Thank you all for the excellent explanations!  I learned something!!<br>  As usual, it was in Wikipedia all along!<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposing_instrument" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposing...</a><br>  ======================================...|`|JCdudGx7aa	My composition teacher explained it to me like this:<br>  <br>  Back before the clarinet was ever invented, there were horns, meaning trumpets and "french" horns.  They had no valves, and played on a harmonic series, much like bugles do in army calls (think of Reveille and Taps).  There is a certain series of notes they can play.  Often times they were tuned to "C".  But, lets say a composer wanted to write in another key.  The performer would then change one of their slides (one that was longer or shorter), and it would then produce a higher or lower pitch, which would then give them a different harmonic series.<br>  <br>  Example: Lets say Haydn writes one movement of a symphony in C.  No big deal.  Well, lets say the second movement is in F.  What does that person do?  Then change their slide from the "C" slide to the "F" slide, and they get a new harmonic series.<br>  <br>  Now, what does this have to do with the clarinet?  A lot, actually.  Since most clarinets are tuned to "Bb", they have can play certain keys quite a bit easier than some other instruments.  "Ab" concert pitch is actually "Bb" transposed.  Its a lot easier to play in the key of Bb than it is Ab.<br>  <br>  Which then leads me to the A clarinet.  Even though its tuned a half step lower than the Bb clarinet, it can play in certain keys easier than the Bb can.  Say we're in the key of concert A major.  The Bb clarinet is playing one full step higher and adding two sharps.  So instead of playing 3 sharps, we're playing 5 sharps in the key of B.  If we play that same piece on an A clarinet, assuming it has been transposed, we're playing in the key of C on the instrument.<br>  <br>  I know this is a long explanation, but I hope it helps answer your question.|`|yYAabiSLaa	The Bflat clarinet is a transposing instrument. That means, it does not play at " concert pitch" ( the pitch the piano is on). Instead, in order to play the same notes as non transposing instruments like atuba or a cello, its part must be transposed. <br>  <br>  ( when playing C)  " the transposing instrument sounds its name"<br>  <br>  If you were to play a C on the Bb clarinet, it would sound the " concert" Bb. The Bb clarinet, along with  other Bb instruments will play everything a whole tone below concert pitch. In order to get around this, orchestral scores will have transposed lines in different keys in order to accommodate  transposing instruments. This is why sometimes you will see in an orchestral work that one of the lines may be in a different key.

19YfKNpJaa	I'm hesitant to answer this, because it really belongs in a different forum.  But I'm going to do it anyway, because I have an opinion, and probably will never visit the forum that this question belongs in...<br>  <br>  First, if the jazz really was a problem for this guy, he should have said something during lunch.  If it was so painful for his "spirit," then why did he go the whole meal without saying anything.  Would you have been offended if, during lunch, he had politely said "could we listen to something else?" I doubt it.<br>  <br>  Second, he's being over-dramatic.  Either he's prone to over-reaction, or (as someone else said) he was looking for an excuse to pick a fight.<br>  <br>  Third, the "real music" argument is silly.  I'm not a fan of much jazz, particularly much soft jazz (if you mean that as a style, as opposed to simply turning down the volume on a big band CD), but I have no reason to claim it isn't "real music." Sure it's real...I just don't care for it.  This boy isn't going to get far in music if he can't find SOME way to appreciate other genres than his own speciality.<br>  <br>  Finally, the comment that "if you love him, you should aim to please" shows an immature understanding of love.  Unless of course, he doesn't love you, too.  If HE does, then perhaps he should take a listen to his own words...he should be sensitive to your likes as well.  There's a word called "compromise" and another called "understanding" that he should look up.<br>  <br>  My wife and I enjoy some of the same music, and some very different music.  I'd rather listen to Webern, and she'd rather listen to  Brad Paisley.  I certainly would never pull the "if you loved me, you'd turn off your music and listen to mine" routine.  I listen to some of her music, and she listens to some of mine.  Sometimes it's not about how much I like/dislike something...<br>  <br>  Just my two cents.<br>  <br>  EDIT -- I hadn't seen how many people here really object to the use of music as background noise.  Ok, perhaps Mozart didn't intend his music to be background noise (although certainly some of his pieces (divertimenti, serenades, etc) absolutely WERE written as background music for outdoor dinner parties, etc etc), I fail to see what the big deal is.  Do you not hang pictures in your house simply for decoration?  If every Renoir copy in your house is there solely for its artistic beauty, how often do you study it closely?  And how often do you not notice it, because it shares the same color scheme as your sofa?  Good art can be appreciated for a wide variety of reasons, and can be "used" in a wide variety of different ways.<br>  <br>  Two more cents...|`|25e1af43f9a5f89fb4d0499909160c98aa	Sounds like this guy doesn't respect your likes and you should be glad he's gone. I have a very broad range of music genre. I like all kinds, some more than others. So if he can't appreiciate different kinds of music, he has to be closed minded as well as narrow minded. If he's a musican, he should have a great appriciation of all different kinds of music. Not just want he likes most.|`|8rvPgdSIaa	What a jerk.  I think that was a good idea you thought of and he does not respect your opinion.  BTW did you ask him why it "hurt" his spirit?  Maybe it made him think of something sad or a bad memory.  But still, I don't even know you and I'm upset at this. You did nothing wrong at all, it was him.  Quite frankly I think he's acting childish.  Hold your head up and spend some time with family or friends to get your mind off of this, and good luck  : ]|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Post this in RELATIONSHIPS please..this has nothing to do with classical music|`|10mOHSZTaa	"Hurts his spirit?" Plunged in to hell?" Bullcrap. He was trying to act like he's too exquisitely sensitive to handle anything but the most perfect music, which only he is capable of selecting. I'm related to a few people who have the same personality type. It never ends with them.<br>  <br>  It's fine if he doesn't think it's "real" music but it didn't hurt his soul and plunge him in to hell. I constantly hear tons of music that I think is absolute crap and shouldn't even be called music, but I don't describe listening to it as being plunged in to hell.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Look, whatever your opinions are about background music (and I'm inclined to agree with a lot of you who are against it) you have to admit that equating background music with hell is a bit extreme and sounds like control-freak behavior. While the questioner could have responded more diplomatically, the guy was acting more than a little controlling.<br>  <br>  If someone was playing a Bach fugue as background noise, that would bug me. If it was his religious work, it would bug me that it was being used as aural filler. I would be trying to follow the voices of the fugue and of the people, which would drive me absolutely bonkers. However, I wouldn't go up to my friend the host and say that using Bach's religious work as background noise was akin to my friend repeatedly shooting me in the eyeball with a staple gun.<br>  <br>  See my point?|`|TpG33NoWaa	People who use music as they would use wallpaper, and play it in the 'background' while talking to me, make me quite angry, I'm afraid.   It is, in my opinion, a crass misuse of an Art that I hold dear. <br>   If they are aware that I am a musician and still do this rather obscene thing, I reach the conclusion that they are in some way mentally defective!<br>  <br>  It is, for me, not the type of music that is thus mistreated, but the fact of its deliberate insertion into an intimate setting.  <br>   Using trendy words such as 'ambiance' does nothing to reduce my affront.  <br>  How could anyone who has even a slender appreciation of Art do such a thing?<br>  <br>  Humans, last time I counted, have only one brain.   When music is being played, the musician's brain wants/badly needs to concentrate on the music, and the hearer's ears cannot shut it out in order to be 'polite' and listen to somebody speaking as well.<br>  <br>  Women's Magazine fostered insults to Music are seriously offensive to a musician.  <br>   Didn't you realise this? <br>  <br>  I am sorry that you and your friend have fallen out.   I can easily appreciate his feelings about this.   Yours are much harder to empathise with, but I don't know the background, of course...|`|qThmcR1Aaa	The guy is an arrogant, high-maintenance, closed-minded twit, and you're better off without him.<br>  <br>  It "hurt his spirit" ... he was "plunged into hell" ... what a drama queen. Him, not you. If he's that sensitive about having a piece of music played in the background during dinner, can you imagine what a lifetime with him would have been like? Just be grateful that he's someone else's problem now.<br>  <br>  Obviously, there are some here who share his self-righteous, elitist view. I feel sorry for anyone who chooses to go through life like that ... a holier-than-thou attitude like that might make one feel smug and superior, but they're the ones missing out on so much beauty in life by cutting off their snooty noses to spite their own faces.|`|aSTmFCiBaa	he lacks musical curiosity,is narrow minded,and sounds angry,,,, i dig bach, berlioz.coltrane,basia,rock,irish,arabic music,also play classical guitar,,,it's all there  to be enjoyed|`|hUYaaXBvaa	it 'hurt his spirit' ..... sounds a bit melodramatic to me<br>  i don't specialize in classical but i have played piano for 12 years<br>  it's a perception that that kind of music is 'more cultured' than jazz<br>  it really just shows his lack of openness to other styles<br>  jazz is its own genre, its not exactly pop music, but still all music has some value<br>  he was just being    odd<br>  no offenese<br>  <br>  sorry that i answred if you only wanted guys )|`|jbAr62ybaa	What puzzles me is that you hadn't had such a discussion before: you didn't know(he hadn't told you before)that "jazz hurt his spirit - he didn't consider it real music" - ??????<br>  <br>       How long had your relationship lasted?

C7umw5Vpaa	I agree. At first it annoyed me, not because I'm a huge fan or anything, But there's a fine line between opinion and just wasting-my-time-but-gaining-my-karma- hate. An opinion of her music and an opinion of the way she looks rather than who she is, if you also notice. I personally think if this is really an opinion, then why the obvios fervent-like hate? Why care so much if you're just expressing envy? Who knows really why there's so much hate towards Beyonce. I just think hate has become main keyword for comunication nowdays. No matter who you are. And since it's the internet I doubt they would say those things so bluntly to her face. I don't like it, undestand it, or care, really.|`|uKXgg9heaa	She doesn't read these blogs, so they can say whatever hate they like!|`|T6PzMyPBaa	wow that's er..a bit much<br>  really childish if you ask me.<br>  because she's not done anything wrong lol|`|A6q6Ravhaa	i  don't like  her  but  don't call  her  names. why do  you  let  things  like that  bother  you.  only  care  about  things  you  can  do  something  about. its  not  effecting  you  then  let  it  go|`|AA10652430	Yeah, it's lame, pathetic and sad and whomever said she oughta die needs psychological evaluation.|`|jgpYS0oEaa	It's very scary.

SCARY psycho!|`|SvzsXddUaa	Ok, even if the person don't like her, they shouldn't wish death upon her.<br>  <br>  And if I dislike someeone, I wouldn't say, "Oh I wish you would just drop dead!".<br>  <br>  Death is NOT something to mess with.|`|sXSgijXnaa	She's an amazing singer.

16t0eV0Uaa	There once was a land far away, in a galaxy far away, and in a alternate universe, far, far away.  There was a land by the name of "Hoobasuck" and on this island, were some of the suckiest things to ever suck ever.  Some of this creatures names were rather interesting... the first Hoobasuckian we observed was the sub species "Fred Durst"  a very fascinating species, with what appears to have the brain size of a pebble, and it rolls everywhere it goes, an amazing adaptation, for the main predator on the island of hoobasuckian is the "KISSarmanian" a very silly looking creature, but one that is not to be underestimated, for it has spikes and claws that every single hoobasuckian fears... we followed one of these KISSarmanians to its herd, and what we found out was shocking... in the sky, were one of hoobasuckians most amazing creatures.. the Mileycyrusiun... it flies by Blowing in and out all day long.  Another amazing creature, which we saw mating was The Herman Crab Lickius, and OMG Do you see that Joe? The Herman Crab Lickius is mating.. yes actually INTERbreeding with the Nick Jonas!  what a site, remarkable!  Who knows what mutant creature will pop out of the Nick Jonas Vagina...fascinating.While continuing our journey on Hoobasuckian, we intertwined with what appeared to be a half woman half beast creature.. a undiscovered breed of suck, we decided to call it the Courtloveian.  We observed the creature cautiously ..it did some very odd things, such as eat its own feicies, and rape a Britney Spears in the wee wee.<br>  <br>  OMG Joe, did you see that? by god.. it appears to be a Katie Perrot, its eating the Courtloveian... OMG its heading straight for us... "SAVE US CHUCK NORRISSSS"<br>  <br>  The end.|`|372458a63fdf2cfd5035da966e6ddf39aa	Once upon a time Lars Ulrich and Alexi Laiho decided they'd become a metal White Stripes cover band. (Why? Sheer boredom) After playing a few gigs and making an LP, the duo gained their biggest (and most annoying) fan, Avril Lavigne. She was trying to trade in her wanna be punk persona into a wanna be metalhead persona, so she started listening to Lars and Alexi. Although they were constantly pestered by her, the guys were a bit happy to have gained a fan. Over the next few months, Avril really grew on them. Soon, she became one of their most trusted (and annoying) friends.<br>  Then one day, while updating his blog, Lars read a bunch of comments on his latest post, entitled "Our Biggest Fan". Every single one of the comments said the same thing, Avril was obviously using Lars and Alexi to become likeable again (at this point the band was quite well known). Lars and Alexi took a few minutes to sink this in and realized the comments were right! The next day Avril was zapped into the 6th dimension by a raygun and never heard from again.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	let me edit<br>  <br>  Chuck Norris<br>  Courtney Love<br>  Bill Kaulitz<br>  <br>  One day Chuck Norris was driving down a road. It was in the middle of no where and he was surrounded by the woods. In the distance he saw a old looking gas station, so he decided to drive down there and ask for directions. When he pulled up he saw a lion at the cash register. Chuck was alarmed but knew by his awesome strength he could handle it, as he walked in the door he relised it was the he/she lip syncer Bill Kaulitz. Chuck looked confused as to weather he should call it Sir or Madam...so he just settled with 'hello'.<br>  <br>  All of sudden a car smashed through the front window of the station and Courtney Love came stumbling out with various syringers in her arm. She looked at Bill and though 'holy **** what are you'. Courtney decided it was time to 'make a move on Chuck' so she did and Chuck gain a very uncommon dease called 'Billyitist'. Chuck turned into a lion like Bill.<br>  <br>  After the ordeal Bill went and recorded an album with his band and he was found out for lip synching, Courtney has had various run ins with the law and Chuck has never been found....some say you can hear his roars in the middle of the night near the gas station...others think the story is bullsh*t..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  worst story EVER EVER EVER|`|aS0nijbhaa	People:<br>  Chuck Norris<br>  Lars Ulrich<br>  Michael Jordan<br>  <br>  While on Ninja killing sprees, Chuck Norris has been known to listen to Metallica. He has done this for years, all the way back to the days with Dave Mustaine. Two decades rolled by, until one day he decided to buy their newest release, St. Anger. Upon listening to it, the god-awful drums drove him into a rage.<br>  <br>  In his fit of saintly anger, he jumped onto a stage during a late night Metallica concert in Argentina, pounded Lars Ulrich into a bloody pulp, and reshaped him into the shape and size of a basketball. He then roundhouse kicked the ball-shape, which flew all the way to Washington D.C., and smashed through the Washington Wizards's stadium roof. Michael Jordon leaped up and grabbed the ball out of midair, and made a game-winning slam dunk powerful enough to shatter the backboard. With that much force, Lars Ulrich was lodged 200 feet below the stadium in the earth's soil, where he dug a hole all the way back to Argentina in time to finish the concert.<br>  <br>  <br>  ...And now you know, the rest of the story.|`|AgQForcYaa	Herman Li threatened to sh*t on Chuck Norris' head, but Chuck Norris summoned Joe Satriani to shred Herman's face off, and in the process, Alexi Laiho challenged Joe to a shred-off. Then John Petrucci came in and pwned all their faces.<br>  <br>  In an unrelated story, Son Gokou and Bill Kaulitz polluted the earth so bad with their use of hair products, that Lars Ulrich was forced to blow away the pollution with his ego.|`|j7imnQ7Naa	one day katie perry kissed a girl, and she liked it. she decided she'd like to kiss britney spears, but britney was busy masturbating with avril lavigne. katie was jealous, and asked to join them. britney said sure, but avril didnt want to. britney finally talked her into it. so katie, britney, and avril happily masturbated together.<br>  <br>  the end.|`|AA12093934	Shred why do you hate Alexi Laiho so much?<br>  <br>  <br>  people: mickey mouse<br>  Nick Jonas<br>  Britney Spears<br>  <br>  One upon a time in a magical kingdom called Disney world (the one in Florida), there was a douche bag named Nick Jonas.

Herman, running to the plane, apologizes the the burning man. Jimmy Page with his incredibly smug cloak rises from the plane like a phoenix and takes the other two on a trip into a tree. This tree has been the home to many people: Jack Lemmon, Charles I and Ghandi among them. They make their way into the ancient oak, archaic in its own way, like an older idol on a blistery chill. They engage in activities that are frowned upon in most places: nazism, Communism, the burning of money and the use of the dreadful "C" word. Oh no!!! They go on further in hopes of more discoveries. Travis' skin peeling of course and then they reach it. It shines like an old car that is upon a pedestal full of old armored checks and foodstuffs. They endorse its endless qualities -as it should only be- and bow to it. While on their knees the demands begin and it gets dirtily hasty. Liking it only on a certain romantic pretense. The greatest love story of the year becomes and struggle for death as Jimmy Page is forgone and stabbed by Travis and Herman. Their self-confidence is oft put into hard places, just to name a few, and they have no escape. Herman begins to crawl on his stomach out a drizzly bear. They beat it, though Travis is charred. Symbolic of a prison. On the outside they encounter the in desperate need of money (and recognition) Joe Satriani, still living in the days of "Surfing With the Alien". Oh how delusional the baldest man known to man is. He bribes charred Travis and that Herman guy to bring him Chris Martin's head on a silver platter; with a bit of garnish and some pepper. Though what Herman and Joe do not realize is the pure awfulness of metal and meddle on the question for ages: is metal truly awful? Yes, it truly is. Tunde told me. Panda Bear told me. Reclusive hermit Jeff Mangum told them. And they all just go back to the flaming plane and gorge themselves upon the ashes.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Cheats (2002)<br>  starring Griffin Dunne, Trevor Fehrman, Elden Henson, David Krumholtz (of "Numb3rs" TV series), Matthew Lawrence, Mary Tyler Moore<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  While other kids buy into countless hours of studying just so they can get a mark in some teacher's report book, Handsome Davis sees it as nothing more than a system of control over your mind. That's why Handsome and his three best friends Sammy, Victor and the cribsheet genius Applebee have banded together and found ways to cheat on their tests all through their school years. Everything had been going along smoothly until the gang entered their final year of high school and the stakes were upped by the school's principal, Mrs. Stark. If they get caught cheating again Stark will make a note in their permanent records and possibly kill their chances of getting into college. But can Handsome convince his pals to pull off one last, great cheat with him and outsmarting Stark and the system, even if it means possibly destroying their friendships?<br>  <br>  Here's the "Answer Song":<br>  <a href="http://tinyurl.com/36j6c3" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/36j6c3</a> <br>  It's based on the final movement of Beethoven's 9th Symphony, sometimes known as the "Ode to Joy".<br>  From IMDb quotations:<br>  Handsome: Crippled elves do dance around a devil covered by blue dress, dairy causes diarrhea, chunky, creamy, butter cheese, <br>  All: Bad Billy does dope, bitches and brews but can't even build a cigarette boat, <br>  Victor: All a bang booze every day above a bridge behind a cave, <br>  All: carpet crawler can't eat eagle, before chicken during day!<br>  <br>  NOTE: You ARE in the Movies section.|`|WeJBlyqsaa	is it by chance "the perfect score"?|`|gGSf6ED5aa	Could it be "Cheaters" (2000)?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218094/plotsummary" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0218094/plot...</a>|`|74O9v8E0aa	CHEATS!!<br>  <br>  awesome movie. my friends and i used to sing the song:<br>  dairy causes diarrea chunky creamy butter cheese....!|`|pOckTUpxaa	The Perfect Score

I've never seen the Simpson's although it's been on for twenty years.<br>  <br>  Family Guy: Stewie the diabolical infant and Brian the dog, are two of the most unusual and unique characters in the history of cartoon comedy.  For the most part Brian and we the audience are the only ones who hear or understands what the baby is saying and Brian dates human women and has sex with them.  Stewie is the "breakout character" in this show.<br>  <br>  American Dad has an ordinary American family who lives with an alien rescued from Area 51 and a talking goldfish that was implanted with the brain of a German army officer.  Right off the bat you might ask yourself why would you watch such a situation but surprisingly it works.  The alien, Roger, is likely the breakout character in this show.  His wacky voice is characterized by Seth MacFarlane and patterned after that of the late great comic Paul Lynde. <br>  .|`|cen8SIssaa	Simpsons are classic, you can never go wrong with them.<br>  <br>  Family guy i think that is a little over the line but in a super funny way!<br>  <br>  South Park, i always thought was super cute and funny.<br>  <br>  american dad and futurama suck!!!!!!!|`|HkImCOSuaa	Family guy cause stewie is tha bomb...|`|qpCUvqq8aa	Futurama.

44c352a49807fd606b77f2a102ce7a23aa	I love that song, it's one of those that literally push you to dance, you just cant listen to it and not move lol<br>  it's very rhythmic, so you better plan on dancing to it too or get a group to dance while you sing, just to make it more appropriate<br>   why would you change the lyrics though?|`|1rvf2Gdhaa	this is the best you could come up with?
hJP9y6kjaa	The more gain you use, the less the differences between guitars matter.<br>  <br>  If you have the cash for it, I would recommend a guitar with a mahogany body, neck-through, with pretty a hot bridge pickup and a lower-output neck pickup. This combination will have a darker tone, with lots of sustain, which is essentially the tone you want.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple of guitars that I would try it out if that was the tone I was going for.... although I have to say that as long as the guitar is set up properly and has decent pickups, the rest of the signal chain is usually what makes the tone, ie a good amp+cab, etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  Saul|`|T6PzMyPBaa	alot of people use les pauls.<br>  nice beefy heavy tone to it<br>  schecter (which is what syn and zacky use)<br>  ibanez is popular<br>  jackson too<br>  <br>  (:

kHcqGLDKaa	Well depends on your movie. Tons of people use regular hand held cameras and a few volunteer actors. It's more of an independent effort and the budget can be as small as $100. The hard part is marketing the movie. <br>  <br>  If your looking to submit your script, do you KNOW PEOPLE? Knowing people always help, but if you don't then it's going to be hard. Some people submit their scripts to agents who will be able to help you in marketing your script to producers, assuming your script has what they feel is POTENTIAL.|`|5pohRQ2Zaa	sell them to mgm.|`|dPi7zMxWaa	no all you need are good actors and a good camera it might be called a B rated movie though.

BBSRuyNfaa	I wouldn't say a secret rage, its just that we don't like to let our emaotions get the best of us, we are good at controlling them, but once we lose control of our emotions, watch out! It may appear that its rage when more likely than not your just used to seeing us so well controlled/behaved the emotional side comes as a shock.<br>  <br>  But yea I must say when I lose control, i go completely mad, to the point where everyone else will say I took it too far, that's why we don't like to lose control!|`|QZzQdh43aa	yes, there definitely is<br>  i had an extremely violent virgo best friend, he enjoyed causing trouble and putting some other kids in the hospital<br>  they have a hidden temper i suppose where they can take things a little too far if they're provoked just enough|`|navuDNYtaa	to make it short and simple, yes.<br>  my last two exes were virgos and they both went to jail for beating me. I am also coincidentally attracted to them before I know what sign they are.|`|J6hhRHdcaa	I don't think secret rage is necessarily a quality of the Virgo...<br>  here's some additional info :)<br>  <br>  The Virgo is highly discriminating, but not necessarily as prudish at some might believe. In ancient times, a Virgin was a woman who was not the property of man, and therefore had the legal right to just say "no." Now, in modern times, you Virgos are known for your ability to be highly discriminating -- especially when it comes to matters of personal desire. When Virgo is ready, however, to say yes, the laser-like focus of your passion is anything but prudish.<br>  <br>  You Virgos have the uncanny sense to see what's wrong with a person, a situation or your environment. It's why Virgo makes such natural critics. Virgo practical analytical abilities are second to none. Your mental process may not be the most creative, but Virgo's razor-like thinking is highly effective. Like the maiden pictured in the Virgo glyph, you separate the useful wheat from the unneeded chafe, the good from the bad. Virgo might be a "clean freak," but most Virgos have a messy closet somewhere or a disaster under their bed.<br>  <br>  The Virgo motto could be "Perfect is almost good enough." On one hand, this trait makes you very employable, for you're not likely to do shabby work. On the other hand, you can be so finicky that you put limitations on your interactions and experiences before they happen. You'll be happier if you can learn to be selectively less critical, both of others and yourself.<br>  <br>  Element: Earth<br>  Earth signs are naturally practical. In this lifetime we are bound to Earth. There is no escaping the reality around us The Earth is about as real as it gets; it can be felt, weighed and it has substance. Accordingly, the earth signs base their life on what is real, not what is imagined. Sensation is valued over thoughts or feelings. Earth signs live with their feet on the ground. Others seek their advice because of their basic sensibility. For earth signs, seeing is believing.<br>  <br>  The earth of Virgo is a changeable earth, light to the touch. It's about practical analysis -- using mental tools to discern the best use for what is around us.<br>  <br>  Sixth House: Work<br>  The Sixth House is about the regular performance of work-related tasks. This isn't necessarily about career. It's about the job you have that buys the bread for the table. This sector is also where we look to find out about health and healing, for it's not only work routine, but also our daily habits of hygiene.<br>  <br>  Key Planet: Mercury Mercury, the Messenger of the Gods, moves around the Sun faster than any other planet. He symbolizes our thoughts -- not only how we think, but how we communicate. In fact, Mercury is in charge of all language. Mercury is our active and rational mind. It is not only "just the facts" but also what we do with them. As the key planet of Virgo, Mercury is about intellectual discrimination. It's the binary function of the neurons in our brain. They either fire and impulse or they don't. Mercury here is about the basic "yes" or "no" decision that must be made for every piece of information that enters our consciousness.<br>  <br>  Virgo Greatest Strength: Your ability to focus your attention<br>  <br>  Virgo Possible Weakness: Need for perfection gets in the way of enjoyment

And I could not dare to  answer this question as more information is needed to decipher whether or not you are a match.  Why don't you just be who you are and see if there is an attraction there.  Or google Aquarius characteristics and then Capricorn characteristics as a starter.  If you can get her birth info: birth date, exact time and place of birth and get yours (don't count on Mom to remember-go to city hall and get copy of b birth certificate.  Then go to Match.com.  They will do a free comparison for you.  And be careful of what you ask for.  If you can get just the birth date and place of birth, go to www.cafeastrology.com and they will give you a free natal chart.

And on the second After the Final Rose, he proposes to Molly.|`|0f35e35fc374dea3ca1e2b585d13080caa	i hate that it came down to these  2 girls, both of them were my favs of all the girls but i think melissa is for him and i think she will win his heart|`|sxdtmWj8aa	I said near the beginning of the season, when there was still about 15 or so girls, that Melissa was going to win.

They'll make a real cute couple.|`|9rz9XJdQaa	i really like melissa, i love her personality and i think shes just right for him. i'm hoping when they have the girls meet ty that melissa will get along with him well. didn't she want to be a teacher or something?|`|JeGFjGWqaa	I love Melissa.

PfXuyIT1aa	I'm an Australian and have one of my best friends in the military, my uncle also did 2 tours of Vietnam. I have seen some similarities with how both have been treated. I didn't agree with the politics behind either conflict however the soldier does not consider this when they are called to do their duty! It is their job to protect and serve our country and that is what they do! I defy most people to show me a job where they put their life on the line continuously! I have heard others criticise the benefits our servicemen receive-it makes me furious! If you are against a conflict petition the politicians do not target the servicemen and his family! I'm sorry people are treating you this way you don't deserve it, it's better that you find out now than later with these ignorant people! Hold your head up high and be strong!|`|lLC7Cf2zaa	uh did you get dishonorably discharged for something?  or are you having emotional and mental problems because of it... or before, but they surfaced then - or after?

All my friends respect the fact that I served my country.  If yours don't they aren't worth wasting your time with.  Thanks for your service.|`|d9iXONYsaa	That is wrong.  Although they might not agree with the politics, they shouldn't condemn you for it.  You dedicated yourself to something much larger than you - what have they done lately?|`|tnKjIBWWaa	EHH?!?!

I think all service members should be treated with dignity and respect, afterall, they are risking their lives for freedom for our country, and to keep us safe. (them bastards that treat you like crap probably envy you??)<br>  <br>  btw 'zeek' so not true!!(answerer 2 below me)|`|6crnT1enaa	Some people assume that if you're in the military, you're either<br>  a) Extremely conservative<br>  b) Violent<br>  c) Unstable<br>  or<br>  d) Too dumb to do anything else<br>  <br>  Of course, this is total bs. You should be commended for your service.|`|2keHX4Eqaa	Most of them think that the war was stupid and we need to be at peace with other countries (Hippies).

Veterans should be honored.|`|de28048ab10e261734a9e1e41461c18aaa	because they are stupid. i repspect anyone who has ever faught in war because they are putting thier lives at stake for us and our country|`|CPWrxvE5aa	It's not only people..Have you seen the way the Military treats their own boys ( Vets )...that is why I never joined..they just want to use ya and throw your away|`|FEeoVfAxaa	god knows all i know is some girls are weary of military guys because they can be known as players|`|9x8ryDv6aa	You should be treated even better than before!<br>  Those people have something wrong with them.|`|UWmUMn4Waa	People lost pride in our troops 'cause of the Iraq war, I guess...it happened to my friend to.

God bless our troops. My brother is Army.|`|KuUKggoraa	They shouldn't treat you like crap, even if you weren't in the military. I think that being in the military means you're strong, and you're not afraid to stand up for your country. I salute you! :)|`|AA11906603	They should respect you more.<br>  <br>  I think it's easy to blame it on "anti-war" sentiments. As usual, the jerks are trying to blame everyone else for the problems they created. There's no mystery here. A bunch of neocons who never served the country started a bogus war under false pretenses. They did not respect you while you were serving and they do not now. But screw them! What you did was honorable. Thank you for your service to this country. The real anti-war people do not disrespect you. Just the cowards.|`|a20834f6b1047d276d0ed096fdbea380aa	That sounds like something that happened during the Viet Nam war.<br>  <br>  Exactly what did you DO in the military?|`|4nQVsEHnaa	that's weird they should treat you with respect and thank you|`|YW1DXceqaa	i would envy you..people treat me like crap for no reason..well if it helps let me personally thank you for helping and protecting our country|`|38rwVxqmaa	idk<br>  <br>  i think being in the military is cool<br>  and i wanna be in it when i grow up<br>  or the navy, or the air force|`|4zuTkXW2aa	Thank you for doing your part to protect our country.<br>  <br>  Do you have a scary psycho thing going and they suddenly realize you KNOW how to properly use a weapon?|`|GhsqaXsdaa	Who ever treats like crap is a jerk off, ignore them, your not missing anything. :)|`|9FLNHJtvaa	I have no clue.<br>  But most military guys are hot|`|AA11258565	you are missing nothing ......they are by not knowing you.<br>  you are to be commended for serving your country!<br>  and I, for one, Thank You!|`|c3ed7dc313b7c0181d81e54a991e8038aa	because they are close minded people.|`|AA10415600	they're rather stupid people.  don't worry about it|`|7769bb12a9339d6add718a4ad2b9363caa	how about not telling them and see what happens...if things change maybe it will....they should say thank you!

rDUiDq93aa	it will take a LOONNGG time to really get into it.<br>  for now, check the reviews by other players and owners. Thats a much faster way to get an idea of the quality.|`|04118ae23b43083371f655128f6eb539aa	It can get confusing.  Your best bet is to find a large retailer and try them out.  Take your time. Each guitar is different.  Each player is different.|`|eGSIXIsFaa	A lot of it is based on preference - personally I'm a maple fretboard kind of guy, but some wouldn't even think of playing a maple. Same with the body, neck, and everything else. Mostly it effects the tone, but it also is important to playability. My suggestion is try to all the guitars you can, and make sure you find out the specifications. Once you know what you like, then you can get a guitar. <br>  <br>  p.s. NEVER buy a guitar online.|`|vEnwbgDqaa	Here's some things I've learned..<br>  The neck, you want it to be bolted because it makes it easy for it to be setup. Rosewood fingerboards usually start to fade after a few years. Jumbo frets make it easier to play faster from what I've heard.. <br>  Pickups are what you really want to look at if you want a good quality sound. I have open coil chrome humbuckers and they make a warmer sound than the stacked ceramic ones that you see on most stratocasters.I don't think the wood makes too much of a difference with the sound. <br>  <br>  Just get a guitar that has a good fret board and pickups!

15b20bc2f63d778baab60d206ce6c1a4aa	Well i think somehow you're confused. At the time of the Turn Back The Pendulum Arc Rose is the 3rd squad/division captain. Also at the time Gin, a young genius, enters the Protection Squads as a seated officer after only one year at the academy. He is placed into the 5th squad. Now at this time he either decides to kill the 3rd seat of the 5th squad in order to take that seat or Aizen asks him to do it to see how strong he is and Gin does it without hesitation. Either way it is just some random, but strong, shinigami that he kills and is not important to the plot except to know that he died at the hands of Gin for no reason or it is/was too important to be revealed yet, the former of the two reasons the most likely. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the main point is that he didn't kill the captain of the 3rd squad. He killed the 3rd seat of the 5th who we knew and know nothing about.|`|LoER4grqaa	I'm pretty sure they don't actually let you know who the 3rd seat he killed was. I went over the mangas and animes and couldnt find anything sorry.
e4h5yVXgaa	No I have an Aries moon. I dont hold on to things. If I messed up, I apologize. If someone else did, I can get over it, as soon as they say sorry. Completely. Thoroughly. Fact of the matter (at least w/in my mind), is everyone makes a mistake/ messes up or are the way they are. Especially if they are sorry then I am soooo empathetic!! But if they lv me hanging, honestly I can rage forever in anger on the behalf of the person who caused it! <br>  <br>  Bottom line, I never do anything to hurt anyone on purpose!! Even if there is a huge gain involved I would NEVER embark on it. I can go w/o. You never REALLY gain anything, when on the flip side you could have much to lose. So when I do do sth that rubs ppl the wrong way, I try to understand where they're coming from so that I can reach out to them. But I NEVER feel guilty, bc I don't do anything wrong on purpose. The wrongs are honest mistakes!!|`|KQjhOdsIaa	no, im an aries moon and i dont necessarily feeel "guilt" for doing wrong. But then again, i dont think it has anything to do with moon in aries.|`|lpyWVR2oaa	Hun, anyone who has a least bit of a CONSCIENCE or self-awareness would feel what you are going through.<br>  <br>  With that said, it's most probably the Capricorn in you ruled by that restrictive planet Saturn which is all about responsibility and karma - you pay for your actions and you get what you give<br>  <br>  And also this Sun-Moon squared Sign aspect which eats you up inside unnecessarily. Try to be a bit less harsh on yourself and focus on the good points!|`|r4skENXIaa	Capricorn is where you're getting your feelings of guilt. Aries honestly could care less about others, unless if they've matured greatly. Capricorn is a lot more understanding and mature than Aries. You're Aries Moon just might indicate a little passive aggressive impulsiveness, which is hidden well with your Capricorn influences. Capricorn is a very emotional sign, but it's hidden real deep. The symbol of the Sea-Goat represents Capricorn and it is said that the fish-half represents the emotional depths this sign carries.|`|1915c9b51bf4f4a90fd8cea8d52841eeaa	Cancer sun, Aries moon and Ascendant. I get mad very quickly but it goes away more quickly. I am very forgiving. People with Aries moon are confusing. Saying bad things very easily and then taking them back. I always feel guilty. I can't sleep when i have enemies.|`|QZzQdh43aa	hmm, yes i think it'd be your aries<br>  capricorn are a bit too stoic, but aries, i notice, have a strong sense of what is right and what is wrong

56bNLJykaa	We'll, today there arent many great directors except a few foreign ones that you may not know (no one being nominated for academy awards.) The old directors- Fellini, Bergman, Hitchcock, Kurosowa, Godard, etc. etc. etc. were all brilliant, and their quality of films were always higher. Generally, with the Academy Awards director does influence a lot- in this case major Hollywood directors are the ones that appear the most, and if they havent won one in a long time - Scorsese (who got snubbed for numerous movies) they gave it to him out of legacy (even though i think he didn't deserve it for The Departed, he is a great director though).

BBSRuyNfaa	Cap no question.. Once virgos fall in love and know your love for them is real they slowly let down their wall and it stays down unless you betray us, even still we'll always have love for you, caps wall's rarely ever come down and only for short periods of time...they are usually more outgoing with friends than their own lovers, because they need everyone to think highly of them.<br>  <br>  While dating, virgos are more hard to get, we have to know its right.<br>  But after the breakup a cap will act like they never loved you to begin with...<br>  <br>  Virgo with a cap for too long, jumped like a banshee when it was finally over!|`|1ICQ1v1naa	I'm a Virgo....i don't think im cold.But i do like sarcasm i think Capricorn is the one that's meaner.|`|r4skENXIaa	Well the traditional answer would appear as follows... Virgo, will be critical, reveal flaws, and have expectations Capricorn might not match up to. Capricorn will be cold, stern, and will try to show no vulnerability whatsoever. The Virgo may not match up to Capricorn's expectation appearance wise. The couple could be productive, seeing as they're both Earth signs thus share some of the same qualities (reliable, practical, etc). Virgo may become overly anxious and worry about what the conservative Capricorn may be thinking or doing. This will get on Capricorns nerves because he/she expects Virgo to just understand and doesn't like having to spell everything out.<br>  <br>  Capricorn is ruled by Saturn, thus stereotypically more mature, so I'd say Virgo would be the one to blame. But maturity can be strict, so it goes both ways. They're both mutually guilty, they both have expectations they shouldn't press on each other.|`|bKpTiFuraa	I would say Capricorn is more harsh on their partner. I know a Capricorn guy who always has something bad to say about someone - they're fake, they're stupid, etc. No girl is ever right for him.<br>  <br>  After a break up, I would say Capricorn would be more harsh. Virgo, unless you've hurt them or cheated on them, would be more cordial with you. They wouldn't be nice, nor mean, but just courteous and respectful, after all - you are a person.<br>  <br>  Virgos are harder to get, we have to be sure that it's right. We're not going to waste time putting in our energy and hearts into something that can fail.

It gets good when they get to the Top 12.  Then every week they have to sing a different type of song. (country, ballad, pop, etc.) I know all the songs which really helps!  <br>  I really enjoy it, except for all the commercials. :)|`|ErN3pbTeaa	Because it is kind of a big deal. AI is producing some big stars for the music industry. Ex: Kelly Clarkson, David Cook, David Archuletta,  Daughtry, Carrie Underwood, Jennifer Hudson, Kelly Pickler, Clay Aiken....People like that...<br>  Its really funny at first, and then the drama keeps us interested until we become attached to the people and we want them to succeed.<br>  This year its not doing it for me like it did last year. I don't know if it is the lack of talent, the people,  or the way they are eliminating, but I'm just not feeling it.<br>  But I think Americans find it fun judging people on their looks, personality, and voices. We are a really shallow country dontcha know!!? :)<br>  Hope I answered your question!|`|9BB5H7aJaa	My brother asked me that last night, and I think it's for the same reason anybody likes any show, they feel like they can "relate" to the characters. American idol luckily has a whole bunch of different characters and it's a competition (like sports) where people might watch to see if the person they like the most (or can relate to, for example) makes it through. That's kind of like asking "why is everybody obsessed with hoodies" or something like that.|`|AA10427489	i can't really explain everyone else's obsession, i can only speak for myself. i've been answering a lot of the idol related questions recently, so i knew it wouldn't be long before we get a question like yours.<br>  <br>  i've never actually followed the show before this.every season i would watch the auditions because they're hillarious , but i never watch hollywood week, or the live shows. the reason why i'm watching this year is simply because i've got a couple of favourite contestants who i'm rooting for,and i agree with the guy with the wendy's picture that it's because i find these people relatable.|`|AA11452399	IDK, Why does anyone like any show? I enjoy watching every season. Its entertaining to me. I don't get why its such a big deal to the people who don't like the show. Why bother slamming it ? Just dont watch it and move on...|`|Wwry0QIlaa	Because it's addicting! You should give it another chance :)
ZTXXdXrdaa	I really want Melissa to win. She is who I liked all season long since the 1st episode. It really seems like her and jason have a great connection. It also seems like she is really ready to settle down and be a mom. I think she could really connect well with Ty too. She seems like a genuinely good and down to earth person. I like molly but I dont think she is right for Jason or ready to jump right into motherhood.|`|II12hFyqaa	I did want Jillian to win, and thought she was going to. Now, between Melissa and Molly, I would like to see Melissa win. She seems to be ready for Jason. I'm positive a lot of what Jason feels for Molly is infatuation (re saying a few times - "I love her eyes. I feel great when I look into those beautiful eyes." Actually I thought Naomi, Jillian, and Melissa all were better matches for Jason than Molly.|`|CuUB8CRXaa	i agree w/J B ... jason's only reason y he likes molly is because of her "amazing'' eyes... eyes r after all not the most important thing in a marriage... so i'd say the chemistry is best between jason and mellisa. i feel bad for jillian though.. she might be our next bachelorette ... awww|`|Ukgl64pSaa	Melissa

Y1aAGPURaa	Really LOL!!!!    Here's an Irish joke for you:<br>  <br>  An Irishman named Murphy went to his doctor after a long illness. The doctor, after a lengthy examination, sighed and looked Murphy in the eye and said, "I've some bad news for you... you have cancer and it can't be cured. I'd give you two weeks to a month."<br>  <br>  Murphy, shocked and saddened by the news, but of solid character, managed to compose himself and walk from the doctor's office into the waiting room. There he saw his son who had been waiting. Murphy said, "Son, we Irish celebrate when things are good and celebrate when things don't go so well. In this case, things aren't so well. I have cancer and I've been given a short time to live. Let's head for the pub and have a few pints."<br>  <br>  After three or four pints the two were feeling a little less somber. There were some laughs and more beers. They were eventually approached by some of Murphy's old friends who asked what the two were celebrating. Murphy told them that the Irish celebrate the good and the bad... he went on to tell them that they were drinking to his impending end.<br>  <br>  He told his friends, "I've only got a few weeks to live as I have been diagnosed with AIDS." The friends gave Murphy their condolences and they had a couple more beers.<br>  <br>  After his friends left, Murphy's son leaned over and whispered, "Dad, I thought you said that you were dying from cancer. You just told your friends that you were dying from AIDS!"<br>  <br>  Murphy said,"I am dying from cancer, son, I just don't want any of them sleeping with your mother after I'm gone."|`|XmD61yBpaa	Very good.<br>  <br>  An irish family have frozen to death outside a theatre in Dublin.<br>  <br>  They had been queuing for three weeks to see Closed For The Winter.|`|TjWA37kuaa	LOL hahaha funny|`|tmyiEtWhaa	LOL didn't get it immediately but that's a good one|`|LgEdjhe0aa	Hehehe..........very funny.

ivqfhzHXaa	sasuke doesn't die...<br>  naruto isn't a shonen ai nor is it a yaoi manga... so i really really really doubt that sasuke and naruto will become a couple.<br>  "every1 dies"<br>  well yes and well no...<br>  right now they are fighting these guys called pain, in the manga they are at where pain destroyed the village and many people died.... supposedly kakashi and shizune are among those people who died.... but i personally think that somehow it'll turn out in that "wow it's unbelievable, i was on the brink of death but i returned when i saw the light light" <br>  <br>  i had always thought that kakashi would die in a heroic way... but i mean they still have other akatsuki guys to defeat, which is going 2 be a pain in the azz so i really don't see how the hell they will make it if kakashi is dead.... they will leave everything on naruto's shoulder, i don't really know what's going to happen... it's really nerve-wreaking but still this fight has been going on for quite a few weeks now, so i'm not really sure how things are going 2 end but hopefully it'll be a good ending and somehow having kakashi surviving.|`|1p0qP4yXaa	don't listen to other people cuz apparently your friends are huge liars lol<br>  <br>  Sasuke isn't dead, everyone isn't dead, and Kishimoto will not make them a couple in the end<br>  <br>  if you want to know what's happening, first stop listening to your friends, and start reading the manga<br>  <br>  Peace Out|`|JwGwUcCsaa	Your friends are just messing with you.  Mine do that to me all the time.<br>  <br>  If you want to know the basics of what is happening, here it is:<br>  Sasuke has a 4-man group and has joined the Astsuki after he was able to kill both Orchimaru and Itachi.  Sasuke is currently hunting down the reminding tailed-beasts (like the nine-tailed fox and the seven-tailed creature).<br>  Naruto is currently fighting Pain, the leader of the Astsui because Pain has attacked Konoha.  Your friend is kinda right about everyone dying, because a lot of ninja have died.  Like Kakashi, even through it is kinda unclear.  Anyway, Naruto has a new power called "Sage mode" which is basically the fox-tailed form without using the fox's help.  He is in an intense battle to the death.<br>  (sorry for all the spelling)<br>  <br>  THE SHORT ANSWER IS: NONE OF THE ABOVE HAPPENED!|`|clPvtugSaa	Naruto and Sasuke are all alive now .<br>  I am a fan of Naruto . I do like it. It is really worth to read it.Meanwhile,as far as I know, you can enjoy Naruto on <a href="Http://www.mangafox.com." rel="nofollow">Http://www.mangafox.com.</a> Meanwhile you can enjoy lots of other manga on it's website. <br>  Have fun !|`|2vUOqAikaa	None of these are even remotely true. Konoha did suffer a devastating direct attack from Pain, but not everybody died. There's was a death toll, but it hasn't been said how substantial it was. Although, it "appears" that one or more "main" characters died.|`|MjN91S9taa	LOL<br>  u should read the manga xDD <br>  cuz thats not true at all haha xDD<br>  its all FALSE :O *thumbs down*|`|HpwevWYlaa	So far, Sasuke hasn't died, and Konoha was blown up but people still lived. No, there is no yaoi couple. In one chapter someone used kage bunshin and turned into Sasuke and Sai for Sakura but that was it. There is no end yet.

'He won't even take an aspirin.' <br>  <br>  'Not a problem,' replied the doctor. "Drop the Viagra tablet into his coffee. He won't even taste it... Give it a try and call me in a week to let me know how things went.' <br>  <br>  When she called the doctor he asked how it went and she exclaimed, T'was horrid! Just terrible, doctor!' <br>  <br>  'Really? What happened?' asked the doctor. <br>  <br>  'Well, I did as you said and slipped it in his coffee and after just a few sips he jumped straight up, with a twinkle in his eye and with his pants a-bulging fiercely! <br>  With one swoop of his arm, he sent the cups and tablecloth flying, ripped me clothes to tatters and took me then and there passionately on the tabletop! It was a nightmare, I tell you, an absolute nightmare!' <br>  <br>  'Do you mean the sex your husband provided wasn't good?' <br>  <br>  On the contrary, it was the best sex I've had in 25 years!............<br>  <br>  But sure as I'm sittin here, I'll never be able to show me face in Starbucks again!'|`|c3svN3Evaa	nice joke|`|zhK1PGioaa	lol! good 1. star 4 u.<br>  =]|`|aIjOfkM8aa	no i havent but its funny|`|wna5OGiYaa	that was funny<br>  i will use it<br>  post more

I really hope that shannon gets her head straight and stays in the group!!....D.Woods and Aubrey can leave whatever i never really cared about those two and i think the group will be better off without them!!<br>  But Shannon is my favorite and Aundrea and Dawn!!<br>  They will be my favorite group in the world if the Shannon, Dawn & Aundrea work it out and go on with DanityKane with them 3!!!<br>  I really hope that its a lie that shannon isnt in the group anymore or else i dont really wanna watch making the band anymore!!!<br>  <br>  Aubrey is too loud and annoying and D.Woods was getting to much of a big head and thought she was ALL THAT!!!!!|`|wFy80O73aa	they are history now!!!|`|d8a746804766b70bab5d2cadd408c158aa	I think Danity Kane needs to move Forward and start searching for Replacements. What the HELL is up with Shannon? It makes me think she Care's Less about her Fans! I think Danity Kane would be okay moving forward with THREE; Aundrea, Dawn & Shannon. I NOW realize that isn't happening. (Shannon in hiding and doesn't want to be filmed) LOL She's acting like a Diva and she isn't anyone Special without her FANS supporting her. Shannon needs to get her head out of her A*s! This kind of opportunity with Bad Boy Records comes once in a life time! Look at Destiny's Child? Three is the Lucky number.  Aubrey is getting Bare A*s Naked for the world to see I wouldn't buy her album IF she made one. Come on she is flat out Nasty Girl! She talks about being this strong women but she's acting like a foolish person by taking the very first OFFER to take off her Clothes for Playboy! I saw those picture's and she's tarnished her image in my eyes. Hey, I think a women body is beautiful IF you respect yourself and Aubrey doesn't! I think her 15 minutes of Fame is almost over. I hope Playboy paid her well. What is Aubrey headed for the Bunny Reach Next? All this is B*tcha*sness!

Maybe cause I am the girl. I do think most of the time I am right though, howver I do give the other person the time to explain and change my mind. At the end if it does make sense then I will actually admit that they are right. Whats ur sign? maybe you are just not compatable with Scorpio and something about the two of you that brings out that side of the Scorpio?...<br>  <br>  Hmmm, my ex was a Taurus. I do not remember us arguing or him being right always. He was always nice and caring and sweet. He was the biggest liar on this planet though. He would lie about everysingle thing! And thats the reason he is my ex! Try to approach the argument in a diferent way! As in , try to let him explain his thoughts as well, and listen to him, sometimes agree to disagree and see what will happen then? He might think the same about you, that you always have to win and feels the needs to prove to YOU that he is right! Guys in general are hard to read, despite their sun sign. So try to look at the things from a different angle, and see where that will take the two of you ....|`|UHTcpdkVaa	Umm, a person's sign doesn't mean squat.  All people are different, when they are born has nothing at all to do with it.<br>  <br>  Also, it's entirely possible that you ARE wrong all of the time :-)

FX68tBh6aa	Me, Yes its very rough, make sure you listen to them or your screwed. Dont look at them and they may make you stand in line and stuff. It is harsh but thats life so deal with it. I mean you kind should be worried but dont be worried like out of your mind cuz its your first offence. Youll be ok hopefully.|`|NqWl2qlPaa	You're lucky you need to shut up and take your minimal punishment.  What would you do if you had gotten thirty days?  It's designed to show you where you will end up if you don't act more responsible.  I would expect for you to maybe get yelled at a lot that day, but as far as them touching you, I don't think you need to worry.  I wish they would do that more often actually. Maybe if they did that to me years ago on my first offense (which was the same thing, by the way) then I would have realized I didn't want to ever be there again and I would have made wiser choices in my lifetime.|`|4BAJoTZhaa	more harsh to break the law. bad practice if you were to get away with it. juvi will seem like forever, even for a day. but you will get through it and it will be all over. just keep remembering that no matter what you do, time will pass, and as long as time is passing, it is getting nearer to the time where you will be released. do pushups. good luck my friend.|`|7fu5qca6aa	ok well i havent been to juvi but my friend has and he said he never want to go back.

My bf has worked in it for 20 years and only had on the job training. Most jobs that require you to work with people without a degree or vocational training don't pay that well, retail for instance. A server/waiter can make good money if they are good at their job. I am a CNA and I have LOTS of contact with people both physically and emotionally. I had a short training course and had to be licensed. I am not rich, but it's a job that's almost recession proof.

68v5ZEucaa	I'm glad to see that things have changed. When I was young it didn't matter if you were smart, just that you were nice looking and rich. The smart people were considered nerds and outcast.|`|tpG1KBj4aa	most of the smart kids in my class that dont participate in sports are considered "geeks"<br>  <br>  its hard because im freinds with them because i went 2 elementary with them and then im friends with the populars who wont even mention their names!|`|rAfg747daa	I never can really tell.|`|qpmGLd7laa	In 8th grade, that was pretty much the case at my school.<br>  <br>  However, in high school, the "cool kids" were a mixture of the smart ones and the stupid but attractive ones.<br>  <br>  I'm in an honors college now, and it seems like the majority of its students are socially inept.  So, I guess it just depends on the competition in your area (or school).|`|hUYaaXBvaa	well at my college i don't know how to answer that, i guess we're all smart in some way or wouldn't have gotten in<br>  <br>  in high school we had about 5 valedictorians, it was the people who wren't really popular but i guess the 'good' students who  got involved in things<br>  some of them had allot of friends but they were pretty moderate, normal|`|K8zo9FWhaa	nope.....im not super smart but hey, not all of us can be and yes i have a lot of friends if you have all good grades and everyone knows at my school your probably looked at as a nerd|`|jcL7gDMKaa	not sure about that but here in the UK the smart people are usually made fun of and don't have many friends.

There are really smart people, but they don't brag. Then there's the ones that ace every test from studying, but to be honest, some of them aren't that bright. They get the judgment of being smart for getting good grades. It's not just learning from the books that makes you smart, it's the common sense and such that makes you wise. And then, there's just some of the people like me. We're smart and have a lot of potential, but no one knows due to our antisocial problems or shyness.|`|WIVpzIdhaa	well, not really here, if ur smart, ur mostly just a cool nerd, but if ur smart and good at everything (theres only a few) then ya u'd b pretty popular here. but most people hate the popular people at my school and just act like their friends, they dont get that no one really likes them and that they r annoying(actually thats only the girls, the guys r good)|`|RVy0yKgHaa	Not to brag but I am actually VERY smart.

AA10262086	Could be a bad cord , try a different one. <br>  Try a different bass through the amp to make sure the amp is okay.<br>  Make sure the nut that holds the input jack in place is tight.<br>  <br>  If none of the above solve the problem then it's probably a loose wire on the input jack, or the jack needs to be replaced. It's not a big deal if you know how to solder. If not get a guitar tech to do it.|`|jdBME4igaa	You might need to go in the back and solder some wires. But if none of them are loose, you should order a new jack. The same thing happened with my old regular electric guitar. As for now if you can't get a jack right away, just loop the cord up over the strap holder thing and see if that works.

He use and manipulate media to degrade other worthy actors by using money power and political links.  You will find telling him lies in every interview.<br>  <br>  It happens with the persons who get much more in the life than they deserves.<br>  <br>  As far as punishing by God, he don't believe in Karma.

Till kuch kuch hota hain he was ok but he's become bored after that. I prefer actors like Naseeruddin Shah and Anupam Kher. They are old but still very promising. Every time i see a movie for this guy Naseerudin Shah, i'm like, Wow, what an actor. A wednesday is a good movie. It conveys good message to the people of India unlike Sharukh's movie. Ya Chakde was different, i agree, but then he can do a lot better. I saw this upcoming movie Barah Aana recently at the film festival in Pune. It's an amazing movie. It's a comedy of real life that revolves around 3 friends. Naseeruddin Shah plays a man of few words yet his presence fills up the screen. Vijay raaz has given his strongest performance of his career in Barah Aana. Extremely well made movie, good cinematography and well execution.

Shahrukh Khan shouldn't be so pride about his superstar image. He should be humble..not only him, someone of that stature look good if they behave humble. I like him as an actor. He should change his way to earn respect from Indian people. He might be the biggest brand, great actor, in fact a superstar..but he will be respected as a person if and only if he is humble.|`|70d867ec0ce9c05d098a7efb66f7d809aa	SRK is way too over-rated in my view, he thinks he is the one and only and no-one can touch him.

PyOmqhmbaa	Well are you ready? Here is the Chicken Jokes! take your time! lol<br>  <br>  BARACK OBAMA: The chicken crossed the road because it was time for a change! The chicken wanted change!<br>  <br>  JOHN MCCAIN: My friends, that chicken crossed the road because he recognized the need to engage in cooperation and dialogue with all the chickens on the other side of the road.<br>  <br>  SARAH PALIN: In what respect, Charley? Charley, Congress had allocated money to the other side of the road and Charley, I said, “Thanks, but no thanks.” Charley, don’t point out that I was for the bridge in 2006 and then I was against it. That is sexist. Or do you mean Charley, our proximity to the other side of the road. You can actually see the other side of the road from land here, Charley. That why I’m an expert on the other side of the road, Charley.<br>  <br>  JOE BIDEN: The chicken went to the other side of the road because… (Continued on pages 2-30.)<br>  <br>  HILLARY CLINTON: When I was First Lady, I personally helped that little chicken to cross the road. This experience makes me uniquely qualified to ensure right from Day One that every chicken in this country gets the chance it deserves to cross the road. But then, this really isn’t about me.<br>  <br>  GEORGE W. BUSH: We don’t really care why the chicken crossed the road. We just want to know if the chicken is on our side of the road, or not. The chicken is either against us, or for us. There is no middle ground here.<br>  <br>  DICK CHENEY: Where’s my gun?<br>  <br>  <br>  COLIN POWELL: Now to the left of the screen, you can clearly see the satellite image of the chicken crossing the road.<br>  <br>  BILL CLINTON: I did not cross the road with that chicken. What is your definition of chicken?<br>  <br>  AL GORE: I invented the chicken.<br>  <br>  JOHN KERRY: Although I voted to let the chicken cross the road, I am now against it! It was the wrong road to cross, and I was misled about the chicken’s intentions. I am not for it now, and will remain against it.<br>  <br>  AL SHARPTON: Why are all the chickens white? We need some black chickens.<br>  <br>  DR. PHIL: The problem we have here is that this chicken won’t realize that he must first deal with the problem on this side of the road before it goes after the problem on the other side of the road. What we need to do is help him realize how stupid he’s acting by not taking on his current problems before adding new problems.<br>  <br>  OPRAH: Well, I understand that the chicken is having problems, which is why he wants to cross this road so bad. So instead of having the chicken learn from his mistakes and take falls, which is a part of life, I’m going to give this chicken a car so that he can just drive across the road and not live his life like the rest of the chickens.<br>  <br>  ANDERSON COOPER, CNN: We have reason to believe there is a chicken, but we have not yet been allowed to have access to the other side of the road.<br>  <br>  NANCY GRACE: That chicken crossed the road because he’s guilty! You can see it in his eyes and the way he walks.<br>  <br>  PAT BUCHANAN: To steal the job of a decent, hardworking American.<br>  <br>  MARTHA STEWART: No one called me to warn me which way that chicken was going. I had a standing order at the Farmer’s Market to sell my eggs when the price dropped to a certain level. No little bird gave me any insider information.<br>  <br>  DR SEUSS: Did the chicken cross the road? Did he cross it with a toad? Yes, the chicken crossed the road, but why it crossed I’ve not been told.<br>  <br>  ERNEST HEMINGWAY: To die in the rain, alone.<br>  <br>  GRANDPA: In my day we didn’t ask why the chicken crossed the road. Somebody told us the chicken crossed the road, and that was good enough.<br>  <br>  BARBARA WALTERS: Isn’t that interesting? In a few moments, we will be listening to the chicken tell, for the first time, the heartwarming story of how it experienced a serious case of molting, and went on to accomplish its lifelong dream of crossing the road.<br>  <br>  ARISTOTLE: It is the nature of chickens to cross the road.<br>  <br>  JOHN LENNON: Imagine all the chickens in the world crossing roads together, in peace.<br>  <br>  BILL GATES: I have just released eChicken 2008, which will not only cross roads, but will lay eggs, file your important documents, and balance your checkbook. Internet Explorer is an integral part of eChicken 2008. This new platform is much more stable and will never crash or need to be rebooted.<br>  <br>  ALBERT EINSTEIN: Did the chicken really cross the road, or did the road move beneath the chicken?<br>  <br>  COLONEL SANDERS: Did I miss one?|`|tmyiEtWhaa	here's a load of pun jokes<br>  <br>  "So I was getting into my car, and this bloke says to me "Can you give me a lift?" I said "Sure, you look great, the world's your oyster, go for it.'" <br>  <br>  "So I went to the dentist. He said "Say Aaah." I said "Why?" He said "My dog's died.'" <br>  <br>  So I got home, and the phone was ringing. I picked it up, and said 'Who's speaking please?' And a voice said 'You are.'" <br>  <br>  "So I rang up a local building firm, I said 'I want a skip outside my house.' He said 'I'm not stopping you.<br>  <br>  I phoned the local gym and I asked if they could teach me how to do the splits. He said, "How flexible are you?" I said, "I can't make Tuesdays."<br>  <br>  I saw this bloke chatting up a cheetah, I thought 'he's trying to pull a fast one'.<br>  <br>  I was having dinner with my boss and his wife and she said to me, "How many potatoes would you like Tim?". I said "Ooh, I'll just have one please". She said "It's OK, you don't have to be polite" "Alright" I said "I'll just have one then, you stupid cow"<br>  <br>  You invented Tipp Ex, correct me if I'm wrong.<br>  <br>  So I went to buy a watch, and the man in the shop said "Analogue." I said "No, just a watch."<br>  <br>  I went into a shop and I said, "Can someone sell me a kettle." The bloke said "Kenwood" I said, "Where is he?"<br>  <br>  So I went in to a pet shop. I said, "Can I buy a goldfish?" The guy said, "Do you want an aquarium?" I said, "I don't care what star sign it is."<br>  <br>  You know, somebody actually complimented me on my driving today.<br>   They left a little note on the windscreen, it said<br>  'Parking Fine.'

They first passed a little<br>  girl who was crying and they asked, "little girl, little girl,<br>  why are you crying?" and the little girl said, "an apple came<br>  down and killed my new kitty". Next they passed a little boy<br>  who<br>  was also crying. And they again asked, "little boy, little boy,<br>  why are you crying?" and the little boy said, "a lemon came<br>  down<br>  and killed my new puppy."

yEiwkDmVaa	The number represents the octave. For example, C4 would be middle C, C5 would be one octave higher, C3 one octave lower.<br>  <br>  The letters represent the keys. The keys are in a repeating pattern of 7 white keys with (5) black keys interspersed. From the white key before the two black keys (in any octave) the notes go C, C# (black key), D, D# (black key), E, F, F# (black key), G, G# (black key), A, A# (black key), B and then the pattern repeats.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

The middle C line was taken out when the treble and bass cleff were modified from the original G C ans F clefs.  relate to the notes in an intervalic fashion and stop the alphabet reading. try to see patterns in what you are playing and even go note to note by step or skip initially.<br>  <br>  Uou should be able to get by and finding out the first few notes with help, then go according to the picture representations of intervals.....like scales are just steps up or down....<br>  <br>  accidentals, like sharps or flats go up or down to the very next key (black or white, does not matter,,,,,,,so ~C flat is really just B)<br>  <br>  Smiles.|`|FMajZYS2aa	D5 means D+A+D<br>  I'm not sure about A#4

As the shot tightens over your shoulder, a Netflix rental cue is revealed. The audience sees what you see: the only available movie in your cue is "Ernest Goes To Jail". You sigh despondently and click on watch it now. Eerie music comes from the computer's speakers and your face turns ghostly white. The camera zooms back onto the computer screen where the tile shot of "Blair Witch Two" is clearly visible. You wrench the monitor from the desktop and hurl it through the window.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Airborne (1993 TV movie)<br>  Wikipedia synopsis:<br>  Mitchell Goosen (Shane McDermott) is a teenager from California who loves to surf and rollerblade. His zoologist parents are afforded the opportunity for grant work in Australia. Eager to accompany his parents to the surf-friendly shores of the South Pacific, he is dismayed to find out that he will not be joining them and instead will be living with his aunt and uncle in Cincinnati, Ohio, so as to finish the remainder of his high school semester. He arrives in the midst of a winter storm to a blue-collar Midwest city, quickly coming to the realization that this is far from the free spirited beach atmosphere that he has been accustomed to. To add to his disillusion he meets his cousin Wiley (Seth Green), who at first glance is an awkward teenager and whose parents' lifestyle and demeanor though warm and hospitable is a bit old-fashioned. // Also in the cast are Brittney Powell, Chris Conrad, Jacob Vargas and Jack Black.<br>  <br>  Here's Part 1 on YouTube, which apparently has the complete film:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEglICBbmbA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kEglICBbm...</a>|`|8miXPCYgaa	Disneychannelsucks|`|483f35cdb658092507dd40d36d78430caa	This link has a list of all the Disney Channel Original Movies and you can probable access movie summaries.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Channel_Original_Movies#Disney_Channel_Original_Movies_.28DCOMs.29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disney_Chan...</a><br>  <br>  hope it helps|`|kbI11Bq4aa	Airborn

Than the subject dies. But the scientist wants to keep going. He mixes the breed of a human in with a locust and than he leaves it alone and watches it day after day for changes in it for a week. Than in 5 days he discovers something growing on it. It turns out to actually be fusing. It was an egg. He waited for it to hatch which it did 3 days after. A blue and purple giant man with wings, big teeth that were sharp, a tail, a thing to sting people with, 18 arms and 3 legs, and long nails. They couldn't stop it. than another one came out the next day. Thousands of them were out and killing things and people.

I can say that if he likes classic rock and you want to get him some contemporary music he might like the Black Keys...as everyone should.<br>  <br>  But if it must be a time period then I'd say his teenage/20's years would probably be the most nostalgic.|`|72b8f107ee3387ea5e38648e2cd678e9aa	well, as i was born in 58..id go with beatles, of course...and classic rock late sixties early seventies<br>  <br>  such as<br>  <br>  doors<br>  grand funk railroad<br>  crosby, stills nash and young<br>  the who<br>  chicago<br>  <br>  though i do like nirvana, puddle of mudd etc|`|PBMuyVlnaa	I'd say anything from 1970 to 1981.

37evQRaDaa	You can make a nice looking guitar from easily obtainable materials. <br>  * A stick of 1x2x36 inch hardwood (poplar is easy to work with, oak is more durable)<br>  * A cigar box or other wooden box (a cardboard box would work too)<br>  * Tuners can be made from eye bolts) (see links below)<br>  * Strings can be made with fishing line). <br>  * If you want frets you can use wire, zip ties, or toothpicks. <br>  <br>  They're easy to make, and sound good. With a couple extra parts (about $5 worth) you can even make it electric (EXTRA CREDIT!)<br>  <br>  You can also build a kalimba from stiff metal and a wooden box. I built a couple using bike spokes and rake tines. Actually I've made one from a cardboard box and wooden stir sticks. I've done these electric too. These a bit more difficult to tune though.<br>  <br>  If you want some help, please join my instrument builders group here: <a href="http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/homemade_musical_instruments/">http://launch.groups.yahoo.com/group/hom...</a> ask whatever questions you have, and we'll do our best to answer them.<br>  <br>  Oh, you can see some of the instruments I have built here: <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/resistzine/sets/72157603324916027/" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/photos/resistzine/sets...</a><br>  <br>  Eye Bolt tuners: <br>  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/lydeardcottage/95719164/" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/photos/lydeardcottage/...</a><br>  <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/tedcrocker/552426472/" rel="nofollow">http://flickr.com/photos/tedcrocker/5524...</a><br>  <br>  Check this website for info on wire frets <a href="http://www.cyberferal.com/UncleBob/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyberferal.com/UncleBob/</a>|`|u2s1dt5eaa	Get 7 or more identical bottles or glasses. Pour water to fill them to different levels. <br>  The sound they produce will have different pitch when you hit them with something like chopsticks.<br>  Adjust the water levels (while listening to them if you have reasonable ears or comparing them to a keyboard) to create an octet.<br>  You can definitely make a simple melody with this setup.<br>  Good luck.|`|msOABQbSaa	Bottles filled with different levels of water and blowing over the top?<br>  Wobble board<br>  Stick with metal bottle caps all down it to make a clinking noise.<br>  I think a guy made some sort of guitar sound using dental floss and a tooth brush once.

2QuGuphYaa	You might be thinking of  "2001: A Space Odyssey"   by Stanley Kubrick.<br>  <br>  The computer's name is HAL.|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	The computer doesn't kill its creator, but it creates a child with the scientist's wife:<br>  Demon Seed (1977)<br>  IMDb review:<br>  Proteus (voice by Robert Vaughn) is the name of a supercomputer designed by scientist Alex Harris (Fritz Weaver) in order to help him with his research. Yet, Proteus is so smart he soon develops his own will. Continuously growing stronger, Proteus takes charge of Alex's house and keeps his wife, Susan (Julie Christie), as a hostage. Proteus' goal is to impregnate her! Proteus is like a feared computer virus in a pre-Internet era: a supercomputer thinking and handling for itself~which is, according to me, a very successful horror formula. The absence of a villain in the shape of a man helps increasing the tension. The setting of the overprotected house is great and causes uncomfortable feelings of claustrophobia. The visual effects may look a bit dated by now, but the film still contains one of the greatest decapitations ever and an outstanding ending!<br>  <br>  Another rogue computer occurs in this film but orders people to build onto it instead of being a do-it-yourself. Also, it doesn't kill its creator:<br>  Colossus: The Forbin Project (1970)<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Charles Forbin (Eric Braeden) is the designer of an incredibly sophisticated computer that will run all of America's nuclear defenses. Shortly after being switched on, it detects the existence of Guardian, its Soviet counterpart, previously unknown to U.S. planners. Both computers insist they be linked, and, after taking safeguards to preserve confidential material, each side agrees to allow it. As soon as the link is established, the two become a new supercomputer and threaten the world with the immediate launch of nuclear weapons if they are detached. Colossus begins to give its plans for the management of the world under its guidance. Forbin and the other scientists form a technological resistance to Colossus which must operate underground. // Also in the cast are Susan Clark, William Schallert, Georg Stanford Brown, Marion Ross and Dolph Sweet.<br>  <br>  I know of another computer film, but I don't recall if it kills its creator or how active it is in its own development:<br>  Superman IIII (1983)<br>  IMDb synopsis:<br>  Computer genius Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) is hired by Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn), computer company tycoon,  to help him with his plans to use a supercomputer to control the world's energy. But, Superman (Christopher Reeve) threatens to interfere with their plans; so, via a special kryptonite, the superhero is split into good and evil twins. Can Superman be returned to normal, or will the computer take over mankind? <br>  <br>  NOTE: HAL of "2001" doesn't kill his creator.|`|EhCLHzK2aa	Colossus?
WIsxqR7caa	You see, the inside of a banana peel has a very slippery inside because it holds the contents so when a peel is left on the ground the smooth part make contact with the floor so you fall backwards|`|H1VIZsutaa	The surface of the inside of a banana peel has a small amount of juice from the banana, which creates less friction between the banana and the ground. When your foot puts a large amount of pressure on the banana peel the peel will slide causing a sudden displacement in gravity.

She's trying too hard to be one of the team, and is blowing it by imitating Randy's remarks, such as using "props" a lot.  She doesn't reach out to people the way Paula and Randy do.  I would like to see her gone.
u6YpiCg9aa	I do agree Adam Lambert is HOT!!! :) In Hollywood week he dressed up like emo. I think he is kinda emo but not totally. He is a rocker. He is like rock-emo style. :) seen some of his pics before joining American Idol and he does not look like he is EMO. :) So probably it is just his style. :)|`|AA12315431	That's how he comes across to me. For the people who say he is a rock guy, did you listen to his performance? He should have been arrested for singing a classic rock song like "satisfaction" and butchering it that way. Yikes! Bo Bice did it way more justice in season 4.|`|uC75y83Taa	He's a ROCKER!!!  I'm anxious to hear him do a ballad.<br>  I don't think he's emo. :)|`|9BB5H7aJaa	I doubt it. He doesn't necessarily dress emo....more "gothic" almost if anything. <br>  <br>  And just because a person dresses that way doesn't mean they cut.<br>  That is kind of naive:/|`|IMu3wBu8aa	He has a certain style and it fits him well. That doesn't mean he's emo.|`|ErN3pbTeaa	Yes his style is emo and gay...not in a bad way..like he's actually homosexual.|`|bDbXGNYhaa	do you really have to label|`|sqeWNMbuaa	He has his own style. . . but just like Simon said, people will either love or hate his performance. . . and I didn't really liked it myself, I mean nice vocals, but no don't really like him.|`|BedqUeyQaa	Maybe it's just because of the guyliner and black dress. <br>  <br>  I know you are talking about the fashion. :D<br>  <br>  [And who cares if he's gay or bi?]|`|CqvatiKoaa	i love him too! but i think hes trying to be emoish but the good thing is he looks good in black! :D|`|vSTihS5uaa	No not Emo just a pretty boy !|`|Wwry0QIlaa	Nah its more of a rocker style. I don't think of it as emo.|`|W2ruNtp8aa	he is so freaking hot|`|rXgMY4AIaa	i love him he is hottttt!!!!!!!!|`|V66nhhs7aa	i honestly don't care if he's emo or gay...the man is hot!!! :)
quIDrXktaa	Because "Led Zeppelin" and "Pink Floyd" were already taken?<br>  <br>  Seriously though<br>  <br>  The had been known as Polka Tulk and Earth when:<br>  "While playing shows in England in 1969, the band discovered they were being mistaken for another English group named Earth, and decided to change their name again. A movie theatre across the street from the band's rehearsal room was showing the 1963 Boris Karloff horror film Black Sabbath. While watching people line up to see the film, Butler noted that it was "strange that people spend so much money to see scary movies".[9] Butler wrote a song called "Black Sabbath" after reading a book by occult writer Dennis Wheatley, and seeing a black-hooded figure standing at the foot of his bed.[10] Making use of the musical tritone, also known as "The Devil's Interval", the song's ominous sound and dark lyrics pushed the band in a darker direction, a stark contrast to the popular music of the late 1960s, which was dominated by flower power, folk music, and hippie culture. Inspired by the new sound, the band changed their name to Black Sabbath in August 1969, and made the decision to focus on writing similar material, in an attempt to create the musical equivalent of horror films."|`|828d07c83a9f68d1c1b9e891350c6802aa	Becuse of a movie.|`|dqCTS60raa	Yes it is from a movie.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	cause it sounds scary...its Sabbath btw|`|xhVe918waa	Black Sabbath, is the correct spelling.<br>  <br>  I think it is because they saw a movie or something.. it was dark and scary,  I guess. Haha, I honestly forgot. xD

Give him your home address so that if he may be in your city, he can drop by to see you.  Also, wish him all the best and tell him you hope he has a successful movie career.

PumYhJSvaa	No. It is the doctor J.D. slept with once. She had short blonde hair, but I can't remember her name!<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: This person explained it well. <br>  <br>  Kim Briggs first appears towards the end of Season 5 in the episode My Urologist. Though she has a late appearance in the series, she is said to have worked at Sacred Heart as long as J.D.. Turk explains that J.D. is unable to see women who wear wedding rings and as Kim was married she went unnoticed by J.D.. She still wore her wedding ring despite being divorced for a while, to avoid being hit-on by her fellow colleagues. <br>  <br>  J.D. works with Kim on a patient and becomes infatuated with her. J.D. pursues her and they go out on a date horse-back riding. Though it ends rather poorly, Kim had a good time and spends a night with J.D. on his half-acre. <br>  <br>  Two weeks elapse and at the end of the season Kim reveals to J.D. she is pregnant. This is picked up at the start of Season 6, where Kim assures J.D. she is definitely pregnant and that she is certain it is his baby. J.D. and Kim debate whether or not to keep their baby eventually deciding not to abort. However, shortly after they decide to keep the baby, Kim is offered a another job in Tacoma, Washington and she leaves in My House. <br>  <br>  When Kim is due for her first ultrasound in My Road to Nowhere, J.D. takes a road trip to Tacoma to see the baby. When he reaches the hospital in Tacoma Kim tells him she has had a miscarriage. As they live so far apart, and are seemingly no longer bound by a baby, Kim breaks up with J.D. However, at the end of the episode, Kim is seen getting the ultrasound revealing that she lied about having a miscarriage so that she could let J.D. go. <br>  <br>  Kim makes a reappearance in My Conventional Wisdom, two episodes before the season finale, when both she and J.D. are at a medical conference. J.D. notices her obvious pregnancy, as she is now months into her pregnancy. Her major lie makes it very difficult for J.D. to forgive her, but he does so -- for his unborn baby. The two move in together, into J.D.'s flat, and become very close again. Just before delivering the baby, Kim finds out that J.D. is with her only because of the baby. She then breaks up with J.D., and delivers her child, Sam Briggs.|`|klhFMdCgaa	Okay...this could take a while.<br>  <br>  In Season Five, we were introduced to Kim, a divorced urologist. She and JD ended up going out and JD accidentally knocked her up. They weren't all that strong as a couple, so Kim faked a miscarriage to see if JD really cared about her. Turns out he was only staying for the baby, so they broke up and she took a job somewhere else. In Season 6, JD finds out that Kim's still pregnant when he runs into her at a medical conference. She then moves back to Sacred Heart and has Baby Sam in Season 7.

UsUJRDsJaa	Be ready to answer this question right off the bat:  "So, tell us about yourself."<br>  <br>  Have your friend write and memorize a 60-second biography.  It should ONLY include things relevant to the job:  the other films and ads that he's done, including student films if that's all he's done so far, stage work, anything, but make whatever it is sound really good.  <br>  <br>  If he appeared in something with someone famous, include that.  Include where he's studied, mention anyone or anyplace that's well known.  DON'T lie.  But work on the piece just like it was a resume, because that's what it is.  <br>  <br>  And as his friend, let him practice his bio with you, and time it.  Have a practice interview, too, and throw questions at him.  It will really help him feel confident if he's prepared.<br>  <br>  By the way, in case your friend doesn't know, they really like to have a resume and photo too, if you can get them together.  It also helps them to remember you.  Make the resume as relevant as you can to acting.<br>  <br>  Also, if he has a short monologue he has memorized, that would help - they may want that, or they make ask him to read lines.  Practice both, if you have any time at all.<br>  <br>  Be sure to dress nicely.  Casual is just fine, as long as you are very neat.  Pay attention to details.  Dressing like the character might dress sometimes helps, but don't overdo it - a lot of people do that and they are usually on to that, and it could turn them off if it's too obvious.  <br>  <br>  If he gets nervous during the interview, just admit it!  They understand, and usually find it pretty charming.  It's much better than them thinking he is a psycho (lol).<br>  <br>  Most of all, be sure to eat breakfast, prepare for a long wait, and relax, be yourself, and have fun.  Really!  And good luck!|`|cdwUaSRaaa	totally agree with george :)|`|IP2suWFTaa	Just tell him,to not show that he is nervous, that he is comfortable with being himself , is comfortable around complete strangers and to show his personality.they will choose him if he is what they are looking for.Good luck to your friend.|`|8miXPCYgaa	OKAY SO YA GOTTA LIKE DO SOME STUFF AND YOU GOTTA SAY THAT HE HAS TO BE A JERK TO EVERYONE THEY LIKE THAT THEY REALLY DO DO IT THEN HAVE HIM DANCE

WV7jQ1oDaa	All of those are AWESOME ideas! You could also have a "Glam Makeup/Hair" table. Have glam makeup, hair spray, scarves, etc. I am an internet radio DJ and I host a once a week 80's show, it's very popular! Hey, if you would LIKE, I would gladly host your party if you give me a day and time. I take requests and you can tune in from any computer, you can let me know. Anyhow. I would definitely do the glam makeup table. Let everyone "relive" the hair bands of the 80's! Have fun!!!|`|Y51w7dNUaa	80's musics another good idea heres a list of bands from back then i like<br>  <br>  1.motley crue(lol)<br>  2.cinderella<br>  3.guns n roses<br>  and ask your dad if theres any other bands he liked back then<br>  also dress up like its the 80's that would be pretty fun and heres a few sites i like<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=2&q=http://www.chiff.com/entertain/80s-party-ideas.htm&ei=Q3WnSaXLLsH7tgeJpOX7Dw&usg=AFQjCNGhFhBGXE0Ao2E70sBJ8L0W9lE_Sw" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=2&q...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=4&q=http://www.thriftyfun.com/tf35130976.tip.html&ei=Q3WnSaXLLsH7tgeJpOX7Dw&usg=AFQjCNHeF1GmRdDexnfgjD7o4fd7FgFfpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=4&q...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=8&q=http://www.party411.com/theme-80s.html&ei=Q3WnSaXLLsH7tgeJpOX7Dw&usg=AFQjCNHtiN8BreYJj9Dq-zz7GrrKHCiMNw" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/url?sa=U&start=8&q...</a> and also try googling "ideas for 80's birthday party" you should find plenty of results hope i  helped|`|iZoICYoQaa	OMFG I LOVE THE 80'S!!!!!!!!! ok so you need to have like wig hair holders andwigs and crap like that idk i just hope that its a really good party im soo sorry!|`|0Uo20SmWaa	Just casually ask your dad, what was his favorite music and songs in the 80's? Try finding them in Cds. Play them at the party. Look up what kind of clothes, and go to vintage clothes shops. Find his old school albums and put them out so people can look at them with his picture when he was younger.|`|NbgxNAYZaa	There was still disco music in the 80's and Flashdance and hair bands. There was the beginnings of video games and home computers. Cabbage patch dolls. What about some old board games or maybe twister? <br>  Sounds like fun. That's all I can think of now. It's late.
hP2nzb2haa	A glow in the dark party is pretty simple. You will need to buy some black lights from your local dollar store, as many as possible is recommended. Call the stores first; most are out, usually available around Halloween season. (I do know Walgreen have them right now and usually always do. Go to your local Walgreen store or check the website to see which Walgreen store have blacklight in your area, type: blacklight... don't get the cheap kinds it doesn't work as great, fluorescents are the best.) Replace all regular light bulbs with the black lights for the party in four corners wall. The lights will have better reflex. Buy glow sticks - necklaces, bracelets, etc. (Michael's Craft store have it right now for a dollar which it contain 15 bracelet w/connector pieces) Your party be in the evening can be held in the backyard or inside the house with a big-wide party room, but if you want it during the day, pick up some plain black sheets and drape all windows and doors with the sheets to keep the daylight from entering your party atmosphere.<br>  Along with your black lights, if it is possible to get strobe lights or a disco ball, go for it! Add a very fun impact to your dance floor. <br>  Also, make sure that the balloons, streamers and confetti are all white or lime green so that they will glow in the black lights. White balloons are the best, just put the small green glow stick (snap it on) inside the balloons and tie-it with a string around the wall or up from the ceiling.<br>  Buy some yellow highlight markers and white paper banners to put on your walls. Let guests write on the banners if they'd like. Buy some big star glow in the dark stickers and stick them up on walls and your ceiling. There are tons of creative activities that you can have at your glow in the dark party. Also if you wish, buy some temporary neon hair dye and streak your guests’ hair to glow in the dark! Don't forget to buy some glow in the dark nail polish. Tell friends to do the same, if they want to. Buy some white face paint and have your guests draw designs on each other’s faces! White will glow against the black lights very well. <br>  <br>  For guests, pick up some:<br>  * Glow sticks, and other glow jewelry<br>  * Glow in the dark sunglasses<br>  * White or neon hats for the guys and masks for the girls<br>  <br>  As your guests walk into your party, hand them all their glowing accessories. There are tons of glowing jewelers sold at your local dollar store or party supply store. Make sure that every guest comes to your party wearing as much white as they can! White glow in the dark.<br>  <br>  Food:<br>  Make sure that it is simple and not something that will require a lot of light to prepare. I would recommend to prepare any food before the party begins or order take out. Get some glow in the dark cups and ice cubes or just a white cups/plates/etc. Serve your guests like Lime Soda or Mountain Dew or buy some package of Jell-O package and mix it up with Lime Soda. Serve drinks with glow in the dark straws. Serve food on simply white party plates. Get sherbet ice creams and cupcakes/cake in neon colors. They’re fun.... be creative and fun!<br>  <br>  Get blacklights and ask everyone to wear all white. Their clothing will definitely glow! It is a great idea to have a dance at your glow in the dark party. Mix some techno in with your favorite music. If you can, hire a DJ for the party. Dance the night away and have a glow stick limbo contest, neon hula-hoops, and hot potato with glow in the dark ball, play flashlight tag with glow sticks, and have "the best glow in the dark face paint". Just for fun get some glow in the dark blow up balls (like the beach ball) to throw around the dance floor. (One ball is perfect.) Have a super great time!<br>  <br>  PS. Since you'll be 16... go to Party City and get those sixteen theme added to your 'glow in the dark party'... get creative.|`|6vgTVPtEaa	maybe have one of your favorite movie to be a theme and maybe have ur friends come dressed up that goes with it????

iQAyt7Uzaa	The Hulk would win.|`|ivqfhzHXaa	somehow hulk has unlimited power the more he's angered the more powerful he is he could beat superman when it comes to brute strength... but the same is his weakness... the more angry he gets the less rational hulk is... he doesn't think much so superman could find ways to stop hulk at least enough until he calms down and turns back into human|`|DgalPu0Iaa	Superman. Sure the hulk is big, but superman his lazer eyes, super strength and alot more. Definitly superman.|`|AA11017655	Superman is invulnerable.  Hulk is not.  Superman could just use his Heat Vision to melt Hulk, or carry him into outer space where Hulk couldn't breathe.<br>  <br>  That's why Superman is not a good superhero.  He's too powerful.<br>  <br>  Unless, of course, the Hulk's green color really comes from Kryptonite!|`|znccVpkeaa	Hulk would overpower him!!!|`|vVka4ZA0aa	Superman vs The Hulk...<br>  Well, you mentioned Dooms Day... Dooms Day is an ancient Kryptonian being, that's how Dooms Day was able to defeat Superman, because remember, Superman is actually a Kryptonian whose powers are charged by Earth's yellow sun. And a show may portray Wonder Woman as being stronger than Superman, but Wonder Woman was created by the Gods and the Gods often enter her body to make changes so she can adapt to her enemies. She is the only being listed in DC that would probably have the strength to have Superman's child.<br>  The Hulk does get more powerful the angrier he gets, however, The Hulk can only get so strong, and he can only grow so tall.<br>  Superman's powers are absolutely ridiculous (have you actually read any of the comics? I'm going to assume "no" since you're asking this question). Superman can literally PUNCH planets out of orbit, The Hulk cannot.<br>  <br>  So, to simplify everything... Superman is actually much stronger than cartoons and movies portray him because it's a little boring if the hero has no struggle. He has heat vision, freeze breath, he can move almost as fast as the Flash, he has super strength and vision beyond human comprehension, and he's practically indestructible. So unless The Hulk comes charging at him with Kryptonite, Superman would destroy him. Don't get me wrong, The Hulk is extremely powerful and would put up a good fight with Superman, but Superman would win. hands down.<br>  <br>  *******************<br>  Listen, Superman is almost as fast as the Flash, he can out smart the Hulk.<br>  <br>  And you need to not be so rude. Some of these people did really think about it.<br>  I know that the Hulk has unlimited potential, but that doesn't mean he's going to automatically defeat him.  The Hulk was separated from Bruce Banner in the film leaving the Hulk as pure rage incarnate which nearly killed Thor, however, Thor and Superman do not have the same powers and they do not have the same personalities. The Hulk can be defeated in any form, you just have to know what to do. If Superman could knock the Hulk down, he may give himself enough time to throw the Hulk into space. Also, if the Hulk wants to cling to him, Superman could fly into space WITH the Hulk. Superman CAN go into space for long periods of time, and HAS in the comics. He can literally PUNCH an entire planet OUT of its ORBIT! That's strength. So you can't say that Superman HAS no chance. And I'll take back my hands down Superman would win. But I'm going to stand firm with my decision that Superman would win.|`|DjQQosqjaa	Superman seems to have the ability to realize he has any ability he wants... So... he would be like, oh, I have the power to throw the hulk into outer space, or something stupid like that...|`|Td6drVi3aa	probably well maybe supeman i might be wrong tho|`|20c0ee5fad0ffb1921a78560f68f591baa	This has already been settled.  Superman wins.<br>  <br>  A year or 2 ago, they had another DC/Marvel crossover event.  A DC character and a Marvel character were paired off, evidently with the intent of finding out which was "stronger" or "better".  I didn't read the whole series, so I don't know what the story was (if there was one).  I know Batman got paired off against Captain America (Cap won--by cheating! :( ), and Superman faced off against the Hulk.  <br>  <br>  The bout opened with Supes trying to talk to the Hulk.  "We've been placed here against our will..." "...we should work together..."  Hulk responded by smiling and popping Supes square in the face.  They didn't show the rest of the fight, but they did show the aftermath: Hulk lying facedown at the end of a miles-long trench, while Superman stood over him--bruised and bleeding with a tattered uniform, but /standing/.  Superman vs Hulk = Kryptonian ftw. ;)<br>  <br>  One final thought, if you really need more than the official results: Hulk gets stronger and more invulnerable the angrier he gets.  Superman IS that strong and invulnerable from the word "go".  That places Superman head and shoulders above Hulk from the very beginning.  All Supes has to do is not hold back (which he always does) and wallop the Hulk with everything he's got with that first punch...and it's game over. ;)|`|GH4ExWmyaa	Superman would beat the Hulk. He already has in the comics, and if the hulks power derives from his anger, superman can just put him into submission, like a bear hug, and wait until he stops being angry. It would be a close fight, but if superman can beat doomsday, he can deff. beat the hulk.<br>  <br>  although it seems to me you just want someone to agree with you that the hulk would win..why ask the question if you dont care about the answers?

Joe would never lie and be mean!|`|AA10479574	if he were to date a fan (a regular one that is not in the biz) it would be because he had feelings for her so he would not have to lie about everything. trust me if he were to date you, its because he really does like you.<br>  <br>  they fail to tell the truth about dating a fan. girls started asking if they were gonna date a fan so they were afraid of saying no. they didnt want to disappoint anyone so theyve started saying yes they will date a fan so no one will get disappointed. <br>  when they say fan they mean someone who will support them but most likely someone they can get to (like someone behind the scenes, a model..something like that) not a fan fan like you. theyre not lying but theyre not telling the truth either.|`|eeKlogL4aa	It would be illegal for Joe Jonas to date a fan because he is 20 years old and all the fans are screaming 12 year olds.|`|ryh5AslRaa	ive heard he would but i doubt he would date you he like men...|`|pUF71f1laa	I think he would lie cheat and steal to get a head.

AA11883118	Everytime you send a movie back they automatically send you a movie that's in your Queue. So if you keep your Queue updated all you have to do is just keep sending the movies back.

The newest releases are usually the most popular so they might be listed as "long wait".  There's a column to the right that tells you whether it's a "short (or long)  wait", "now" etc.  If you're signed up for 3 or 4 movies at a time you're better off having at least 20-30 movies in your queue because they'll always have something to ship to you.  I also always put a lot of movies in my queue that are currently in the theater.  It will put them into the "saved" category at the bottom of your queue and it will list the release date as unknown.  As soon as it has an firm dvd l release date, it will automatically move it into the bottom position in your queue.|`|VPCVswkpaa	im pretty sure that since the movies are in you queue they will just go ahead and send them 2 u regardless of how many movies u chose when i first started mine just to be sure i added like 20 movies and they came either the next day or the day after.|`|kpP9sBtJaa	on ur list you make if u have 2 at a time or 3 at a time it will send the top 2 or 3 on ur list...the rest will be sent when u send them back after u have watched them..

RKQwl2uzaa	I'd recommend going to a used instrument store/pawn shop and trying different basses out to see which one feels comfortable.  Some like Fender, some like Washburn, some like Gibson...to me it depends on the player and what suits them.  For a starter bass I don't think it makes much difference personally.  Just find one with a straight neck and good intonation and go to town.

At the time it was popular, I can recall hearing two versions of it. One was the longer version where it started out with a man talking to his dog and the dog was howling. The other was shorter and started with the instrumental introduction and the preamble was edited out.

ZKVlF2pKaa	Simon Cowell has been in the entertainment industry for a long time, this guy is a huge deal. He is the one who brought us Teletubbies, il Divo, and Leona Lewis. He's the one that started all these kids versions of songs and started the music marketing to kids. He's know his stuff and he knows what will sell and what won't. He never liked Taylor Hicks, he hated Taylor Hicks. He heaped praise on the second place contestant, Katherine McPhee (even though he didn't like her) just because he didn't want Taylor to win. Taylor won anyway and it was a triumphant tv moment, but then nobody bought his album. It did abysmally. Simon was right, his music wouldn't sell.|`|vV1hPhfWaa	It doesn't matter whether they are right or not.  What they say goes.|`|plcVbZoDaa	What are you talking about?

It's all rigged anyway, so they just go and say whatever the producers want them to say about the contestants.|`|El4XqmVZaa	They have been in the music business a long time.

AA12151417	pennies are worth more as scrap copper than as money<br>  <br>  <br>  ello Lil Miss|`|HCHqzkQraa	I still fondly remember pennies buying bubble gum...<br>  and 2 pieces of candy. At that time, minimum wage was $1.00 an hour.<br>  Where I live minimum wage is $7.24 per hour. That would mean by old standards, bubble gum would be $ .07; however, I can't find it for less than $.50, meaning the dollar, in most instances buys less today then when I was a kid.|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	Nobody has went with obvious "See a penny pick it up. All the day you'll have good luck." ; )<br>  <br>  I remember when gumballs were a penny|`|VeDJa0m9aa	It's only good luck if it's heads up. And then you are a penny richer.|`|9lBe1JGAaa	I think its more of the idea of irony. <br>  <br>  Its ironic to acquire a thing of such little value, so we associate it with something of great value to make up for it. <br>  <br>  Nothing special about a quarter though =D|`|ATeFooJ4aa	idk lolz <br>  <br>  <br>  answer mine?? <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Atl0AWup1gYTgPvwf67aM3Pg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090226212753AAbNWEv">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|AA10674006	Lol.

d9iXONYsaa	No.  I would probably strangle the turd and bury him or her in a shallow grave.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	I had a roommate who was a racist, not in the shave your head and weave excerpts of Mien Kampf into conversation way but in the way he is pissed off for losing his job to a Mexican kind of way. I moved out because one of my best friends was Mexican and he knew it and he seemed to hold it against me.|`|st2zmU88aa	yeah i have, i have family members who are racist.<br>  i don't agree with them but hey they're family.|`|991409e2f8815e4e8a645dd82791db41aa	everyone is to some extent.. so I guess I could but I would try to work some of it out of them..|`|qAfnWKQCaa	My father hates indians and mexicans, I lived with him as a kid.|`|7aisLVeiaa	No. They wouldn't be alive for very long.|`|a577675893457f8844900f790e549222aa	I wouldn't be attracted to them so no|`|DhUMjZxtaa	yes i probably could.|`|b6c9b3f40f9ac8337ea22396c739b02faa	NO. I would get into constant arguments with them. My father (well, he is actually my stepfather but he raised me) is a classic, old fashioned racist. I am used to it up to a point but sometimes it pisses me off to where I just want to get away from him. He's also just intolerant in general, like he dislikes gays and Jews and basically anyone who isn't Irish and Catholic and fairly conservative. He annoys the crap out of me, because I personally judge everyone on a very individual basis and I'm also a raging liberal. My father and I do NOT see eye to eye! I actually suspected from very early in my life that I was not his son, and it turns out I was right. My brain works completely differently to his. I hate to say it, but I think I am much more intelligent than he is, solely based on the fact that I can see how illogical racism is and he can't!|`|q3KCDrMAaa	I couldn't deal with some guy talking about how horrible white people are all the time, because it just gets old and if it's done more than three times, it just comes off as excuses... I know my race has been through a lot, but for the most part all the real horrible parts of history for blacks in America have passed... a little. Now, if he wants to talk politics and REAL history then fine. But if he is just going to rant, then I just can't listen to it or bother with it...|`|uE2aOqeNaa	Depends on how racist. If you are talking about a KKK member then no. If you are talking about some one who thinks that other races are different and not quite up to par I could if I had to and I would hope to be abe to change there mind|`|PfXuyIT1aa	No and No, definitely NO-it goes against what I believe and I wouldn't have that person in my life in whatever form!|`|Tr1hzduraa	I do and I think he is so ignorant he doesn't even realize he is a raciest.|`|JYPrhKrgaa	i think i could<br>  <br>  as long as they dont go around saying "stupid n***ers" and just yelling it out or anything like that.<br>  <br>  a quiet rascist maybe|`|0NlOtRwLaa	probably not.|`|MNZ27Nkhaa	noooo i wouldn't, u should except people 4 who they r , n wat color or beliefs they have ....|`|IWU0lbDXaa	hell no|`|X8n46T9kaa	it would drive me crazy|`|kQM2CZkXaa	i already do. it's funny how love will blind you to people's faults|`|ngITkzPpaa	as long as their not racist towards my race, i couldnt care less|`|9dtrWO5laa	its really annoying to live with someone who is like that.<br>  I have friends of all races and it gets me so mad when someone is picking on someone elses race!|`|vyfkyYvVaa	I have to, she's my mom. lol|`|tYr0pqQeaa	though i have my thoughts and opinions...so does everyone else...if they are racist, then i hate that fact. i dont hate the person. i may think he/she is retarded for thinking that way, but as long  as they dont hurt an innocent person...i could probably stand them|`|2PTlXs9zaa	Born and raised by my dad - just the way they were taught. <br>  I couldn't be married to one, no.|`|rUMGPXqwaa	not that i would want to, but if i had to i could|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	No. I can't stand people who are closed-minded.

His character is more "real", and his shortcomings are genuinely funny rather than offensive.<br>  <br>  Peter Griffin is too self-absorbed, obnoxious, and has a cruel streak that negates much of his humorous side.  Nothing about him is endearing as a character, and he's more a pain in the butt than anything else.|`|IMu3wBu8aa	I'm going to go with most of the answers and say Peter. Homer is hilarious too, but Peter is just a dumb@ss and he makes everything sooo funny. He can say 2 words and I'm on the floor holding my sides!|`|IN7xvFqdaa	Homer Simpson.<br>  he still really cares in the long run<br>  i think Peter Griffin is funny for us but as a father he is extremely hazardous and will scar his children seriously.|`|Vbfq5YUTaa	Peter one reason is he IS mentally retarded <br>  and homer can be smart at times|`|k6M48eUMaa	Both are complete fkn retards, but I'll say Homer Simpson.

T3X7Aci4aa	Would it be any good? It would probably be good, but it would never live up to the hype. It would sound either outdated or like they're trying to hard to keep up with the new generation.<br>  <br>  Which producer should handle the beats? 1 track by Marley Marl, 2 by Premier and the rest by producers that have a modern sound, but aren't to far removed from the 90s sound. 9th Wonder, Ayatollah, Marco Polo, Soul Supreme, and DJ Revolution would be good.<br>  <br>  Which emcee would stand out? Masta Ace is the only one whose done anything significant in the past 5 years, so I think he would probably be the best, but he wouldn't get the most attention because the rest are bigger names. Rakim would probably be acknowledged most.<br>  <br>  How many records would it sell? A little less than 100,000. 150,000 if mainstream media promotes it.<br>  <br>  Would anyone care? People love super-collaborations.|`|41mwqPuPaa	Would it be any good?<br>  -Yes<br>  Which producer should handle the beats?<br>  -Premier, Eric B, Marley Marl<br>  Which emcee would stand out?<br>  -Big Daddy Kane<br>  How many records would it sell?<br>  -200,000<br>  Would anyone care?<br>  -^^^the 200K that bought it plus the ppl who downloaded it|`|yT6Mezweaa	Would it be any good? I would say so<br>  Which producer should handle the beats? Preemo of course<br>  Which emcee would stand out? Rakim and Masta Ace would get more attention I think.<br>  How many records would it sell? 450,000, Hip-Hop heads would be all over that.<br>  Would anyone care? I would|`|OGNBOaKyaa	yeah...it would be dope, but you couldn't pay all those rappers to drop an album that wouldn't sell...and i say it "wouldn't sell" because as i continue to preach...REAL MUSIC DOESN'T SELL!<br>  Thank you & goodnight!|`|vDrTzGKzaa	Noone cares now.|`|UX2dqQQVaa	1) It would probably be one of the best hip-hop collaboration albums of all time...it might even get other legendary MCs together to do collabs or at least work together. It could revive hip-hop<br>  <br>  2) Hmmm, you'd have to have DJ Premier, 9th Wonder, Marley Marl, Hi-Tek, Pete Rock, and Rick Rubin.  I would even get RZA, Kanye West (he can do hip-hop beats, look at that Reebok song), maybe even GZA or Dr.Dre.  Too bad Dilla is gone.....<br>  <br>  3) Rakim probably...but to be honest, Krs-One can stand out too, but it would probably be Rakim.  He is hungry since his Aftermath album never dropped.<br>  <br>  4) Records total?  Two ways to go with this....one: It would sell how most hip-hop albums sell with old school MCs....not great (which is a shame).  Probably only selling like 40,000 first week, maybe 250,000 total.  OR people could get really excited because this is something like a movement, and it could do 500,000 and at least go gold.  I hope the 2nd would happen.<br>  <br>  5) Hip-hop heads would care....other people would be like, who are these guys?  People in the industry would care...well the ones who are worth a damn.  People like Lil' Wayne, Soulja Boy, or Plies would be like, damn old rappers need to quit making music.  They would just hate because they are LAME!|`|TJyTAwDxaa	Would it be any good-HELL YEA<br>  Which producer should handle the beats-DJ PREMIER/RZA<br>  Which emcee would stand out-ALL OF THEM<br>  How many records would it sell-THERES GOTTA BE ATLEST 1MILL PPL WHO STILL LISTEN TO REAL HIP HOP<br>  Would anyone care-MAYBE ALL THE REAL HIP HOP HEADS,NO ONE OVE 18 WOULD PROBLY KNO WHO THEY WERE,|`|aexLhdXqaa	It would be good........<br>  <br>  Dj Premier and whoever...<br>  <br>  Rakim would stand out<br>  <br>  It would be a indepedent release. I would predict it to have the same faith as the KRS ONE and Marley Marl cd that recently droped like last year. <br>  <br>  <br>  Only true hip hop headz would care and it would be a classic but it would be madddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddd... slept on. Like no promotion no nothing... and the people who cop it would be blessed with str8 rawness!|`|O1t0hY8Gaa	I think it would only reach out to the real hip hop community<br>  but probably an instant classic<br>  Rakim would probably stand out or even big daddy kane<br>  producers, ur looking at primo, pete rock, madlib, marley marl, jazzy jeff<br>  ppl would care for sure|`|dEYKu0r2aa	Hell Yeah<br>  Probably Pete Rock Or Premo<br>  Big Daddy Kane<br>  Not Many Considering Radio D!ckrdiers<br>  I Would|`|qC4qaA4Haa	It would sell 148 copies.<br>  <br>  Lil Wayne is not even apart of the question but riders feel to mention him anyway lol.|`|1zw3Nj3xaa	every knows it will be good<br>  9th wonder and cooking soul are dope<br>  rakim<br>  lol like 5000 in the first week<br>  not really|`|6fxr3VBGaa	take KRS-One and Kool G Rap off and yeah<br>  <br>  Premo probably<br>  <br>  Big Daddy Kane<br>  <br>  400,000<br>  <br>  yeah

And she seems level headed.  I personally don't think they need four judges, but who am I?

They still want me.  One was a cop, one was a lawyer, one was a boxer- he was the real psycho one, psycho like punch anyone looking at me, not sue you or throw you in jail like Bill or Paul, or psycho like kill you, like Tony.  He always said he was in the mob, but I don't think he really was, he just liked to carry around a gun and threaten people.  Talk about jealous!  He put one guy in the trunk of his car just for looking at me.  I kind of like the jealous type.  It's a turn on for me.  I'm working on that with my therapist... that's why I picked a small little guy like you who was non-threatening.  Is that someone at the door?  Quick, get under the bed.

Um9jbMPgaa	I normally have a tune worked out first, then depending on the chords/melody, build words around that. It is far easier for me to apply words to musics than music to words because at least you know how the tune goes and can therefore choose which words sit better where.

xCifmFfkaa	I feel like it could be true... it would all depend on what he's laughing at, and if you could tell if he were sincere or not.<br>  <br>  Ex: He's laughing really, sincerely hard at a horrible racist joke-- man's probably an a*shole.<br>  <br>  He's laughing sincerely amongst friends, maybe reminiscing.

o2FJIXS9aa	I would say Sagittarius is the luckiest, I am not sure about the unluckiest. I am a Pisces with a Sagittarius rising and still seem to get the "lucky" influence. I win contests, raffles, and pretty nice amounts in the lottery without even trying. Partly the reason things seem to go right for Sagittarian types is their sense of optimism. The old thing about believe and hope for the best and it will happen seems to be true. If I HAD to pick an "unlucky" sign it would be Capricorn. They seem to be pessimistic and usually work hard for whatever they receive.|`|63ff1e2e36a5822cdda3d11750463689aa	Aquarius is the luckiest because they have witty qualities and generally love themselves and others..maybe not romantically though....<br>  I don't think there is an unluckiest sign...every sign has their ups and downs : ]|`|yxotSLIfaa	None.<br>  Luck/opportunity doesn't come alone. <br>  Think about this scenario:<br>  1.

It's saturday 28th February 2009, you wake up in the morning, go to the mall for a while, the dress you want is on sale, 90%!, go home, sleep happily.<br>  I believe every choice you made give impact to your future.|`|AA11417199	The Unluckiest is Sagittarius...everyone says that they are but that far from being the truth. Sagittarius have it the worst..don't listen to the other signs..It's so ******* fustrating when  people believe that. So Sagittarius are not lucky...trust me, i'm one.

He's just living life like other guys his age. it could be that he probably just drank coffee, or maybe the lighting made him look like that, but really, aren't personality and values way more important than looks?|`|7c23576f02a357e495342008b32b69c5aa	OMG! can people ever be nice?? who cares if his teeth are a little yellow, everyone in the world as a little yellow in their teeth, and who cares if his teeth are a little crooked.  just because he is famous and rich, doesn't mean he is not a teenager.  he is 16 years old, he is gonna have some problems looking perfect.  i think he is cute whethere his teeth are white or yellow or pink...who gives a crap.  his personality is still good. he is still very sweet.|`|1a6a3af6da727166c63a917a0c6ce580aa	it's probably just the picture quality. his teeth are actually a little crooked, and he wears a retainer (probably at night) (dont ask me how i know this)! :D|`|v1tHjJ3haa	who cares, he still's so cute, just proves, no one's perfect !|`|oe5eNuH1aa	Well, yeah!

Yes they are|`|V5AliBPMaa	Gross. <br>  When I over loved them them I always liked Joe and no one else.<br>  And that pic just proved my point.|`|Vz1PDV0aaa	ya i know he is hot in all, but ya i don't like his teeth either.|`|q8pV5Ry2aa	kind of...|`|NHcvPEAhaa	they do look it.|`|nQIVg9kVaa	ew. ok. it's not just you...|`|CQI1hOQSaa	yeah, there not perfect pearly white. But then again, he' only 16. He still has time before he "has" to whiten his teeth. Although, he may need braces, his teeth are somewhat crooked & he has a little bit of an overbite (:<br>  <br>  i still love them brothers though, they were awesome on SNL. <3.|`|nb8s6Dl3aa	yupp, they are yellow.<br>  ew- maybe he should just go back to smiling with his mouth shut.<br>  <br>  But ohh well.<br>  <br>  (:<br>  <br>  Team Joe.|`|2sXE44qxaa	its all about joe :)<br>  <br>  but yes they do look sorta yellow, not too much though|`|MJ3wE8bQaa	Yeah they are a little.

AA10406285	Hm-mm. I certainly wouldn't like that myself. I'm 51 and I don't look at 15 year olds as "little."  Young yes, but not little.<br>  Is it their voice itself that sounds as if they're talking down to you or is it the way in which they phrase things, such as conversing in very simple words etc..? All I can think of is that perhaps you come across as a little naive or maybe just very sweet. If that is the case, I wouldn't take offense. Their tone is most likely just one of endearment.<br>    If it persists up to age 16 and is really bothering you, try taking steps to let people know you aren't a kid. Make sure and make eye contact, speak with authority... Don't change yourself though, just slightly adjust the way you interact with people.|`|4ZnqA7vgaa	not little... it hink just immature...i know it sucks.|`|68ce7bd873a8d57e0241369627f2ef71aa	no. some people just cant let go|`|DtGFWUP5aa	I'm 21 and think of fifteen as sort of little, but it's not really appropriate to baby talk a teenager, or even anyone for that matter. It's not good for babies, and it's insulting to anyone else. Unless it's a cutesy girlfriend boyfriend thing. So...no to baby talk, but yes to "little". <br>  <br>  Don't worry about it, I'm 21 and people still think I'm 15! I'm a shorty. I know what it's like to be treated inappropriately for your age, but it's no biggie. :)|`|ectaeydbaa	Not "little" but inexperienced.  We (adults) think back upon when we were 15 and realize how young and immature we were- even though we thought we knew (just about) everything then.  And when I say immature I don't mean it negatively.  It just means there is still a lot of growing up to do at that age.  I remember being 15 and thinking 30 year olds were OLD!  Now I'm almost there.|`|bOvx199Saa	15 yrz is a critical age as u r nt mature enuf ( ull find out in couple of yrz tht u took a bunch of wrong decisions wish it wont be tht awful n dont regret ) at the same time u r nt a kid anymore<br>  anywayz i guess bein a teen is so much fun so try to make the most outta now bt be carefull as most of the time ur estimating for many situation wont be r8 so u may get ur self into troubles so an older frnd n i do mean older like over 35 wd help with tht n 4 sure havin one of ur parents as a frnd will be perfect unless they r nt understandin enuf <br>  um nt too old n talkin like ur grandparent um only 18 bt thts wt ive learnt in the past yrz =)|`|3IimJWgXaa	Alot do, depends on the person. Some adults show teens as much respect as they would anyone, and other adults find that it doesnt matter because they are superior. You must always respect your elders, even if they are being the smaller person and not treating you how you feel you should be. Make a stand for yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck doll face!|`|kQM2CZkXaa	depends on the context. you wouldn't expect a 15 year old to throw a tantrum but you wouldn't really expect him to be financially independent either, they're still kids in a lot of ways|`|cNiVaykaaa	Those people are douche bags and the only reason they talk down to you is to make themselves feel signifcant.<br>  <br>  Next time someone talks to you like that, smack them then tell them to grow up and stop talking like a dang baby|`|yiArumCVaa	It is more that they know very little. At 15 it may seem like you know a lot but you don't.  This is something more realized later in life.|`|Leo4z1EFaa	YES. I'm 21 now and I think about all the stuff I did when I was 15 and think "omg i was so young for that, etc" and when I see young girls doing stuff I always think so too. A lot changes when you get older|`|kuFAx4ymaa	yes.  Maybe because you use the word 'cuz' still...<br>  <br>  also, at 15 you still lack the real world adult experiences that have made so many of us jaded and cold.|`|x62wDqmRaa	15 year olds are a pain in the butt and adults try to avoid contact with them. Their feet stink too.|`|dlrximyQaa	I'm 19 and I consider anybody under 18 to be little.|`|vrGyG5Esaa	Yes. Im 19 and see 15 as "little" even though Im young,|`|4INMBsskaa	kinda.|`|b5owaxU1aa	yes in the adult world 15 is just a little kid|`|kUsUPGCraa	fuken question|`|xXyy51Efaa	Ew, yeah, all of my parents friends go on saying aw she is so cute, how old are you honey?<br>  <br>  I'm like 14!! Yeesh, annoying a bit?<br>  <br>  smile for the camera|`|M8f4BorPaa	yup.|`|CotWcTI0aa	I was at the college the other day along with other kids from my school, and one college girl said, "Awww." And, yeah, I'm 15. She wasn't talking to us like we were little, but she said we were cute beacuse we were little compared to everyone else. I think we do look very young, but I don't know why people think we're "cute." I think cute might be from 0-12. But then again, I'm 15, so I don't know what I look like to adults. And even if we look young, I hope they know that we don't have that little-six-year-old mentality.<br>  <br>  Teachers sure don't treat us like little kids haha!|`|991409e2f8815e4e8a645dd82791db41aa	yes you're a kid.. but a big kid.. so don't feel to bad sometimes things you say actually stand for something.. adults will listen to you as long as you act like you have sense no matter what age you are|`|b32e560414238926779c6d2630e98a48aa	um, not "little" enough to talk to you in a little kid voice! my son is 6 and i stopped years ago! WTF?|`|ghz5D5iLaa	My youngest two kids are 14 and 12. I don't think of them as little or treat them as little.|`|d9iXONYsaa	You are not looked upon as being "little", just inexperienced in the ways of life.  If they are talking to you in a baby voice, they are not quite right in the head.|`|d15523b6f2eb977e0485a8956eed4c73aa	I don't think this is something you can generalize - it depends on the 15 year old as well as the adult.  I know a 13 year old girl that is as mature as girls that are 10 - 15 years older than her.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	I don't think you should be talked to as a child when you are fifteen but when you get a few more years under your belt you will realize just how young you really are.|`|DrQFBMQeaa	that age is kinda in between. too young to be adult but too old to be a kid. more proper to say young lady or young man, not little.|`|R1uFA7nKaa	Yes you are still a kid, enjoy it while you can!!   Trust me its not fun getting older!|`|eZCCSMykaa	when i was 15 i looked like i was 20|`|sJNoTGQVaa	if you look like you can kick my ***, you're not little|`|OPKbGXUFaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I'm 14 and my gym teacher calls freshmen little kids.

5LxpvXSmaa	Nick had a decent voice but Norman persona was too big for this show. it is all about singing and he went over the top with it. Mad no -he got alot further than he thought he would and has had enough exposure and is gathering a bigger fan base by the minutes so he will succeed in the business if someone grabs him now while the iron is hot.|`|VvbOSbRnaa	With Norman Gentle/Nick Mitchell... he is a GREAT entertainer. He can sing, but I just don't think this is the competition for him. American Idol is supposed to be about finding the best undiscovered talent in America (ie: David Cook, Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson) and even though Norman/Nick has a good voice, he is no where even close to the level of talent of these past winners.|`|3TQCwtxJaa	No, not upset at all. The thing with him is he actually had a good voice. Maybe if he wasn't acting like such a clown all the time and took this a little more seriously, I think he would have done better. <br>  I wouldn't count him out yet though. The way this season is going, I wouldn't be surprised to see him as a wild card.|`|rHrr7zmVaa	No, he was awful, he shouldn't have made it to top 36.|`|d8a746804766b70bab5d2cadd408c158aa	Hell NO! I'm glad he is GONE! Loser! He disgraced himself! He ruined his OWN chance of making it further. Why should you feel sorry for him? He shouldn't have acted Foolish and taken this more serious!  Peace!|`|LvywvZSeaa	Yes!!!! My husband (and everyone else in my family) thinks I'm crazy. But he actually does have a decent voice, and he kept me entertained. Maybe they'll let him come back on wild card week.|`|kNWevwzUaa	no.<br>  no.<br>  <br>  He needs to go join the circus.|`|dc500182581d351f03c845444a3479f5aa	Sorry I dont watch tv|`|sy3XG2ZNaa	Yes he could sing! He was funny and entertaining! There are some real comedy singers out there! But I guess some people are boring unlike us lol...|`|uC75y83Taa	No, I'm not upset.

Seriously. RoboCop explores larger themes regarding the media and human nature in addition to being a big budget action film. The director, Paul Verhoeven, is also known for his use of Christian symbolism. The character of Robocop can be seen as a sort of Christ figure. This is represented in Murphy's horrific death (crucifixion), his return as RoboCop (resurrection), and one scene near the end of the film where RoboCop is seen walking over water.|`|d55D0Ci4aa	300 - Spartan King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) and 300 Spartans fight to the last man against Persian "God-King" Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) and his army of more than one million soldiers. As the battle rages, Spartan Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) attempts to rally support in Sparta for her husband. The story is framed by a voice-over narrative by the Spartan soldier Dilios (David Wenham). Through this narrative technique, various fantastical creatures are introduced, placing 300 within the genre of historical fantasy.<br>  <br>  Black Hawk Down -Black Hawk Down is a 2001 war film directed by Ridley Scott and based on the eponymous book by Mark Bowden that depicts the Battle of Mogadishu, a raid integral to the United States' effort to capture Somali warlord Mohamed Farrah Aidid.<br>  The movie features Josh Hartnett, Ewan McGregor, Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, Ewen Bremner, William Fichtner, Sam Shepard, Jason Isaacs, and Orlando Bloom.<br>  <br>  <br>  Courage Under Fire - A soldier discovers how elusive the truth can be in this first major film about America's role in the Gulf War. Lt. Col. Nathaniel Serling (Denzel Washington) was the commander of a unit during Operation Desert Storm who mistakenly ordered the destruction of what he believed to be an enemy tank, only to discover that it actually held U.S. soldiers, including a close friend. Since then, Serling has been an emotional wreck, drinking heavily and allowing his marriage to teeter on the brink of collapse. As a means of redeeming himself, Serling is given a new assignment by his superior, Gen. Hershberg (Michael Moriarty). Capt. Karen Walden (Meg Ryan) was a helicopter pilot who died in battle during the Iraqi conflict, and the White House has proposed that Walden be posthumously awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. Serling is asked to investigate Walden's actions on the field of battle, but he quickly discovers that no two stories about her are quite the same; Ilario (Matt Damon) says Walden acted heroically and sacrificed herself to save the others in her company, while Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillps) claims she was a coward who was attempting to surrender to enemy troops. Meanwhile, reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) is hounding Serling, trying to get the inside story on Walden and on Serling's own difficulties. Matt Damon lost 40 pounds to prepare for his role in Courage Under Fire, which resulted in a potentially life-threatening illness for the young actor|`|5mtdXAhGaa	The Color Purple<br>  Memento<br>  Imaginary Heroes|`|82gfwLRQaa	The Guardian|`|4pL0fjeVaa	Fight Club<br>  <br>  How about The Aviator or Gangs of New York?

The comedic wit of Groucho, the tom foolery of Harpo, and Chico playing the immigrant rube.  Groucho has just been appointed the leader of a small country suffering an economic collapse.  His solution: rally the country for war.  Unlike many of the Marx Brothers movies, this one does not feature musical solos by the brothers.<br>  <br>  "Cry Freedom" starring Kevin Klein and Denzel Washington.   Washington play Stephen Biko an activest rallying his people to peacefully overthrow the government of South Africa in the 1970's.   Klein plays Donald Woods, a South African newspaper editor, who befriends Biko.  When Biko died in police custody, Woods tried to get the story out to the world, but was met by government censorship.  Based on the actual events; this is one movie people should watch.

WIlH1LOEaa	Close family yes... friends no!|`|wmBK9uASaa	No,,that`s putting on people,,they should only do what THEY feel comfortable doing,|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	no depends on what it is.<br>  do-ill drive you around<br>  dont-im not gonna let you borrow money|`|e3xzMnuHaa	it depends on your definition of friends. you should start the paper by defining the word friends. i personally think that best friends should 100% be willing to do anything for each other no matter what.|`|Yg1QR4mmaa	To an extent, you shouldn't be blind to the intentions or the consequences of your actions no matter how good a friend they are.|`|RjeIQybPaa	If it is going to benefit the other person, yes, even if it means to do something bad|`|DDnxY3k1aa	yes. but not dangerous things like robbing and smoking and drinking.|`|ywKXxSRGaa	It depends on what that 'anything' is. in general, yes i think they should. A friend should be there for another friend, no questions asked, and never think 'whats in it for them'. Unfortunatly, finding friends like that are rare. <br>  People also have different ideas and views on what a 'friend' is. Out of 2 friends one friend will always do more for the other.|`|nrVX9FJzaa	In my opinion, yes a real friend should do anything for his friend but not at all times, you should depend it on the situation, remember you are a human and not a puppet that will only follow in what your friend was saying.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://MarkJacobsBags.com" rel="nofollow">http://MarkJacobsBags.com</a><br>  <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/fashionsense09" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/fashionsense09</a><br>  <a href="http://markjacobsbags.com/?page_id=41" rel="nofollow">http://markjacobsbags.com/?page_id=41</a>

LkTcLWTOaa	I think she's going to announce that Rick is staying at the company because spoilers say that Ridge turns to taylor for comfort and that the employees at FC are not happy to see rick still there.  i can't stand rick so i hope they're wrong.<br>  <br>  found these spoilers on another site<br>  <br>  The fallout from Brooke's press conference affects everyone. Stephanie pushes Taylor to help Ridge. Believing that Ridge won't be searching for them, Rick and Steffy's passion reaches new heights. Young lovers share pillow talk. Ridge is unable to sleep and sets out to find his daughter. Brooke warns Rick just in time for Steffy to leave. Rick's life is in jeopardy when he's alone as an arsonist strikes. The list of suspects who attempted murder grows almost as quickly as the flames engulfed Rick's beach house. Marcus makes a confession to Pam. Marcus confesses his deeply held anger about his breakup with Steffy to Donna. Rick's many enemies aren't pleased to see him back at the office. Rick makes good on his threat to Owen. Owen teams up with Thorne against Rick. Stephanie undermines Brooke. The police question Marcus and later find evidence pointing to the culprit. Brooke warns Rick to keep his secret from Ridge but Taylor reveals it. Ridge and Rick are catapulted into a showdown that has explosive results.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	The origin of the term "G-string" is obscure. Since the 19th century the term geestring referred to the string which held the loincloth of American Indians and later referred to the narrow loincloth itself. William Safire in his Ode on a G-String quoted the usage of the word "G-string" for loincloth by Harper's Magazine 15 years after Beadle's and suggested that the magazine confused the word with the musical term G-string (i.e., the string for the G note). Safire also mentions the opinion of linguist Robert Hendrickson that G (or gee) stands for groin, which was a taboo word at these times.|`|39ixfEIraa	becuz it curves up like a G....and its on ur vaGina, and in ur G spot...idk put one on and ill show u|`|R9zrDAkeaa	i wonder these same questions at night<br>  why is a drive way called that when you park on it?<br>  i mean this is confusing. . .|`|Xds6e9k6aa	Because it looks like a G-String.|`|CXwjdUgDaa	a gangsterrrr came up with it<br>  and he was a geeeeee|`|DDnxY3k1aa	i wonder the same thing...|`|XERgPbZmaa	its in the shape of a G??<br>  <br>  no im just playing!<br>  <br>  idk why its called a g string<br>  <br>  good question lol|`|8zwL5YwFaa	Cause Thats The G Spot?

ajrXIiZcaa	I did like this episode, even though I thought ahead of time that I might not once I knew it was going to be about Locke. I'm not sure if you're looking more for facts that can be backed up, or people's personal theories, but here goes:<br>  <br>  I believe that Ben did not come there planning to necessarily just kill Locke. If he simply wanted him dead, it would have been easier to just let Locke kill himself. I think that Ben wanted information from Locke. Ben knew that Locke had seen some of the Oceanic 6 by that point, and likely wanted to know what Locke's plan was, what he was telling people, and what Widmore had told Locke. He may have always intended to kill Locke after he got that info, but I'm not sure about that. He seemed a lot calmer until Locke mentioned Eloise Hawking's name, at which point Ben visibly stiffened and looked angry. I think at that point Ben probably had all the info he could get from Locke, and so he killed him. Also possible that he didn't want Locke around to further Widmore's agenda.<br>  <br>  This episode was important for a few reasons. One, now we know how Locke ended up dead. Two, it introduced the relationship between Locke and Charles Widmore. Other things I found interesting were  <br>  <br>  1)the explanation for Abaddon - we didn't get much, but now we at least know he's affiliated with Widmore, and apparently not a friend of Ben's!<br>  <br>  2) the fact that Helen had died - I had wondered what happened to her when Locke left. The interaction between Kate and Locke regarding having ever loved someone was interesting and possibly telling, too...maybe that has a lot to do with why Locke is so drawn to the island, so willing to risk anything and everything for it? He *was* truly in love, but then he lost that love - and it was his own fault. Also a heartbreaking scene, to me, and I really liked the opportunity to see the more emotional side of Locke. <br>  <br>  3) Locke landed in Tunisia...Ben also landed in the desert there, and that's where Charlotte was when she heard about the crash, and saw the buried polar bear bones! Now it finally makes sense (a little bit) how a polar bear could have ended up there, since it's apparently "the exit", as Widmore said.<br>  <br>  4) Now we know how Ben came to have Jin's wedding ring and how Ben knows that Jin is alive. Ben had left prior to all of that so I wondered where Ben was getting his info about the island.<br>  <br>  So - I could clearly go on all day. Lost trivia, my theories, etc are (perhaps sadly!!!) some of my favorite things to talk about.  :)<br>  <br>  There are a lot of other interesting things about this episode, such as how Caesar saw Hurley vanish before the plane crashed, how Locke is alive now back on the island (similar to Christian Shepherd but will Locke be sort of ghostly like Christian? He seems pretty normal and human for now...), why aren't the Oceanic 6 all together on the island, why did the pilot and "the woman" take off in one of the boats (personally I think it was probably Sun that went with Frank, and they're probably headed to the main island to find Jin - they'd assume he'd be there rather than the Hydra Island, I suppose)...<br>  <br>  I hope you don't give up on Lost. I think sometimes there are just so many questions and you can feel like you're not getting enough answers. Every week after it's over I feel like WAIT!!! THAT WASN'T AN HOUR, COME ON!! But, I love it. And keep in mind that the writers have a story, beginning to end, in mind. They wouldn't sign on for further seasons because they didn't want to compromise the storytelling. With this in mind, they must think that the route they're taking to tell the story is the best way for them to tell it, and perhaps you'll look back on this episode and think, okay, that makes sense now!|`|dEpHQNqbaa	The shows pace has allways been the same,but if you lost patience,then nobody forces you to watch it. <br>   Ben stopped Locke because he needed to see what  Locke knows. He found out that Jin is still alive and that Eloise is the only one who can help them get back. After that, Ben couldnt just say "thanks,you can go back hanging yourself now"....<br>   It is obvious that Ben could have done things TOGETHER with Locke, but he wants to be the "leader", if you know what I mean... <br>   I just cant wait to see the look on Bens face when he meets Locke on the island again.|`|Dj7C8yO5aa	pssh i love it. i dont think anything really interesting is going to happen on the island though, like we know that faraday and jin and everyone are going to try and infiltrate the dharma camp at some point, because we already saw jin dressed in the jumpsuit and we know that faraday warns charlotte as a child never to come back. i don't really know what they would come up with as a reason for why you would do such a thing. <br>  <br>  i wanna find out more about the history of the island itself. and how widmore was exiled and such by ben. i enjoy it.|`|i9MKTn26aa	So interesting to see what Ben's intentions really are?? Is he the evil guy that they're portraying him to be ? Or did he kill Locke because he knew that Locke had to die to be resurrected but could NOT commit suicide...so maybe he killed him to ensure that he would come back to life the way the island needed him to be. Who knows!!! At this point Ben and Widmore claim the same things about each other and I'm curious to see who is actually the bad guy here...or perhaps they both are.|`|AA11548524	the whole ******* show is boring as hell, who the hell are the others? why are they still showing more flashbacks? when is the audience going to get some kind of clue or anything for that matter<br>  <br>  the whole show fails!!|`|rGsHlvtaaa	sucked|`|SLEWs28Waa	dont hate on lost<br>  lockes annoying<br>  last night was ok<br>  i dont get lockes drivers chracter|`|7CsLJ4I8aa	Because Ben wants to be the one to save the island.

e2de787293a0a529a4a68912e844f003aa	I got braces playing horn too.  It is hard at first but the key is to keep practicing and not give up.  Buy the Art of French Horn Playing by Philip Farkas and a small mirror and put it on your stand.  Use it to constantly be able to check your embouchure formation as discussed in Mr. Farkas's book.  Also look at Chap 16 (i believe) about mouthpiece pressure.  This is the biggest thing about braces.  If you push the mouthpiece against your lips too hard, your braces will cut your lip.  Develop your lip muscles more (by practice and proper embouchure) and you will not need as much mouthpiece pressure.  That is when your high register will start to return.  Your range and tone will not return if you simply wait, you must practice hard and try to make them return.  Most importantly don't adopt any sloppy/bad habits to compensate for braces, you won't have them that long and don't want to mess things up later on.  Looking back I am actually very glad I had braces because now it is easier to play horn with straight teeth, and I learned very quickly how to not use too much pressure.

X45rxI7gaa	Nope, this movie is gonna suck for so many reasons. <br>  <br>  There was no reason for Hollywood to make this film except to scam fans of a show I doubt they've ever watched.. Watchmen could've been made by misguided fans who were also morons and Transformers was at least based on something with an admittedly foggy continuity.<br>  <br>  But Dragonball is one long continuous story with very specific plot points and charactererzation. It is NOT a hard film to make. Hell, it should be easier to make than most action films because you don't even NEED realistic fight scenes or even spectacular acting... there's not a single reason someone couldn't cast an Asian (if not Japanese) Goku and use the characters the way they were written. Its not bloody Shakespeare!<br>  <br>  Bulma meets Goku, have laughs, fight silly bad guys, pull off amazing stunts, more laughs, have long, drawn-out fight with whoever the villain is. I could write a script for that in one week and still have it be faithful without rewatching that many episodes.|`|2awj8ptIaa	yeah....he rocks........

56bNLJykaa	Not for a while.. and beside, the Criterion collection already has an extensive list of DVDs, so they will continue, and even if they eventually stop you will still see their DVDs around.. The Only problem with there Blu-Ray releases, is that they will be only releasing about 5 movies every few months.. At that rate it would take forever to match their collection- but I do imagine that along with the converting DVD-Blu Rays on their list, they will release all their new-to the collection DVDs on Blu Ray format when they are released.

HqtdnJvqaa	yes its possible to do very well without ever reading music but its not very likely. why don't you just learn to read music? its really quite easy and every musician should know how. i learned in the 5th grade so if a 5th grader can do it im sure you can. buy one of those beginner piano books and teach yourself or maybe ask a friend who knows how to read music teach you how to. if you can afford it go for the private lessons they are way worth it in the end.|`|sJNoTGQVaa	Well, I heard the girl in Dresden Dolls can't read notes. And Stevie Wonder, well, he obviously can't. So some do. Though I suggest you learn anyways|`|lLij19HKaa	If you have the patience, take some lessons again. Sight-reading is a valuable skill. Some of us don't possess it, and it can be a roadblock. I can't sight-read, but I can B.S. my way through the sheet music if I know the song.<br>  <br>  I took guitar lessons as a kid, so I knew the treble clef. Then I asked my sister how the notes corresponded on the piano, along with the bass clef, and that's all I needed. Most of the songs I know, I learned with tapes and my Walkman. And because I can't sight-read very well, I have to memorize everything I play.<br>  <br>  I love playing with the music. I don't have to just play what's written, I can transpose & improvise to my heart's content. I've re-arranged a number of songs, sacred and classic rock, both. Playing by ear is a very cool gift.|`|c7Zmlediaa	I'm the same way; I took piano lessons for a little while when I was younger (about 7) and I didn't really learn how to read the notes.  I'm now taking piano lessons again, but I find that playing by ear is a whole lot easier than learning to read the notes.  It was the same way with flute too...|`|Uv6fADcaaa	I play at least a dozen instruments... and I can't read a note,lol.<br>  <br>  Most people can't play by ear (I think it must have to do with how each individual learns and processes information) ... but I don't imagine it would matter, unless you want to play with an orchestra. Plenty of musicians in bands play by ear...|`|781f1b49265b1eed1172c3bab9e54872aa	yes playing by ear is really great talent<br>  i forget who, but there was this one guy who couldnt read notes, he would just play the instruments and he kept what sounded good<br>  i can somewhat play by ear, not many people can|`|LOdkuFZ7aa	Playing by ear, especially with instruments that can play chords like piano is a really useful skill. For some people it takes forever to learn. However, I'd still recommend you learn to read.<br>  <br>  The advantages to learning to read notation are that you'll actually be able to communicate with your producer other musicians and tell them what you're looking for. Reading also opens up the door to playing other instruments|`|6RPMfXYBaa	I play guitar, and it's hard as h*ll to play by ear, so I envy you too lol.

jNCvPDf7aa	The only Government that I know off the top of my head that has taken children is the Australian government.

I06nlEVwaa	To Jaden K. (7th answerer),<br>  <br>    Hinata IS a heroine now. To jump into a battle like that for someone she loves [before Sakura at that (sorry all you NaruSaku fans)]. . . THAT is heroism.<br>  <br>    Besides that, I don't think that she really is dead. <br>  <br>  1) Shinra Tensei's impact isn't what kills, it's being buried under rubble it creates.<br>  <br>  2) So her eyes are open. I'm thinking the wind was knocked out of her, so she's too tired to move (she was in the enormous one that destroyed the village so she obviously has previous injuries).<br>  <br>  3) If she WAS dead from the impact, why did Pain/Nagato come and stab her?<br>  <br>  4) We saw the stab from Naruto's point of view. How do we know he hit a vital point?<br>  <br>  5) If number four is true (that he didn't stab a vital point), why did he stab her period?<br>  <br>  6) Considering number five, I think he's trying to make Naruto angry. Seeing as his little speech from before was conflicting with everything Jiraiya said in the past.<br>  <br>  7) He could be trying to make Naruto go enraged so he loses control of the Kyuubi. Think about it! It makes sense!<br>  <br>  -Jiraiya said, at one point, that using fox's chakra is harming Naruto. The more tails the worse it is.<br>  <br>  -When the Kyuubi uses up it's OWN chakra, then there's no more fighting for Naruto except in taijutsu. And if he's forced to use that, odds are, he's too weakened to do that.<br>  <br>  -If Naruto is that exhausted, it would be all too easy for Pain/Nagato to drag him to Akatsuki base.<br>  <br>  8) DON'T DIE HINATA!!!|`|VLRkJOOuaa	I think it's a really sad chapter, too.<br>  <br>  Sure Naruto might be really bad *** right now, but that also means he has even less control of his humanity; anger (his emotions, in general I believe) is his fuel.<br>  <br>  And Hinata is dead (I think). That is not "good"! Especially after her confession. tsk, tsk.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Definitely an interesting chapter... but sad as well.|`|OYVn5Yktaa	dude the **** was kick ***!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! i cant believe people actually thought hinata and naruto were gunna be together. the protanganist always ends up with the heroine thats the way it is! i mean come on!!<br>  <br>  EDIT: naruto absolutly has to kill pain! he has  killed of sooooo many good charecters i mean its almost a little ... stupid like damn how many is this guy gunna take out. naruto needs to kill him quick. a damn SIX TAILS!!! hes gunna be the whole nine in a minute|`|zukR6mOvaa	well three things were very shocking<br>  1.hinata confessing her love<br>  2.hinata's death<br>  3.6 tails<br>  but i really hoped naruto ended up with hinata. her character was to achieve something<br>  she never got a chance. im too sad. <br>  P.S-i thought bijuu were like living chakra. didnt know they had bones.?!!!|`|oqQjnpfGaa	Hinata don't die. <br>  <br>  Naruto please kick the hell out of Pain...he is just sooo annoying right now...I just can't stand this anymore!<br>  <br>  Current Desktop: Hinata saying..."I Love You" to Naruto...the best I have seen so far...can't wait until next week....|`|yuKYRfhAaa	This was my least favorite chapter of all time. I really really hate Hinata she is a very annoying character. I really hope she does not end up with Naruto and that she lives long enough to see Naruto to end up with another character.|`|PdfvF104aa	i must agree the transformation was great buh what is that skeling ton from and where does it come form ( i know his nine tailed transformation is the fox). i hope they kill nagato since hinata died its only fair lol|`|dxTFJb3Paa	I'm glad Hinata finally found the courage to tell Naruto how she feels about him. And Naruto in six tails is pretty bad ***.|`|btFSgJmlaa	Bullshit.<br>  <br>  1.  What the f*** happened to five tails?<br>  2.  You could see that coming from a mile away.<br>  3.  Not even close to an Atomic bomb.  It was more like a clusterbomb.<br>  4.  No.  Gohan's transformation was actually meaningful.  It symbolized something.  Naruto's was all about rage.  And 16 sacrifices himself on purpose to tell Gohan it's okay to go all out.<br>  5.  Complete and utter Bullshit.<br>  <br>  I'm now starting to root for the big bad, just to see it end like Berserk.|`|KIOR56r6aa	Bad A**!!!|`|5uUSJNSLaa	Oh. My. God.<br>  <br>  Wow is all I can say. I seriously did NOT expect Hinata to confess to Naruto. And HELL Naruto went berserk and had gone six-tailed. Far OUT was it shocking.<br>  Damn, I think Ima sh!t myself from unexpected things bursting from this chapter.<br>  <br>  Wow (again). I didn't think Naruto would go six tail. It was so cool! But I hope Hinata didn't die from the explosion.|`|ehF2XiMbaa	I just finished reading it and OMFG OMFG OMFG DUDE I SWEAR MY HEART IS ABOUT TO STOP. I NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS EXPECTED THIS KIND OF TWIST. I AM SPEECHLESS. I CANT MOVE LOL. I SWEAR I'M IN COMPLETE AWE. ONE OF THE BEST CHAPTERS IVE SEEN IN ALL MY LIFE!!!!<br>  Edit: I just read peoples answer and Hinata cannot die :[ if she dies then its completely...agh NOOOES. She cant.|`|ASoKuntMaa	I just have to say that if Hinata is really dead, that is so messed up!|`|7a2efb9a491bf91f2d2a622649572fdfaa	nooooooo hinata!! i teared up a lil! she better live! 6 tails should be fun tho!
Catsy82Caa	it's normal to happen with new strings because they have not been stretched out yet. play with them for a bit. do a lot of bends and that shouldn't be a problem.<br>  <br>  i dunno what kind of bridge the showmaster has but if it's floating make sure that's not screwed up.|`|x3CXKalvaa	The problem could be in the new strings, did you stretch them? <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvDdYYs0Zc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUvDdYYs0...</a><br>  if you did, it could be your tuning heads.|`|6RPMfXYBaa	New strings go out of tune fast, or it could be something wrong with the bridge ( I believe that's what it's called), I know my bridge (if that's what it's called) is a little messed up because my high e string is to up, so to say, from the other strings so it brakes easily if you play something hardcore on it.

But right now, you don't have to worry because they probably won't start touring until we are both 15...<br>  When I went to Madison Square Garden's I was lucky enough to have my older brother take me instead of my mom, but me & my friend got to into the concert and seeing them there, we didn't even notice he was there :)<br>  <br>  So, for you, just pretend not to know your mom, or show her videos of mcr concerts on youtube so she can see that they are not violent or anything and then maybe she can just let you go alone. <br>  <br>  BUT, if your mom does have to take you, depending on how your mom is like, I don't think she will think mcr is scary. Gerard might just swear alot and stuff, but they are playing their songs most of the time anyways.

olqP9ZbUaa	There's not much difference between the physical shape of each bell.  As for the sound, that's really a matter of opinion.<br>  <br>  Within the Bach Stradivarius C model bells, 229 generally refers to a lightweight bell.  As a general rule, the lighter the weight of the bell, the brighter the sound.  So you can expect a more brash tone.<br>  <br>  The 239 bells are standard weight.  So they'll produce a darker, more rounded sound.<br>  <br>  239's are also listed in their catalog as "hand hammered", so while I'm not an authority on the subject, I'm guessing that the 229 bells are not- perhaps they are machine hammered.<br>  <br>  I'd suggest going to a professional brass shop to try out the various horns.  That will be your best bet to evaluate and compare the sounds for yourself.<br>  <br>  Lastly, you could try searching or posting here (<a href="http://www.steinwaymusical.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=1)," rel="nofollow">http://www.steinwaymusical.com/forums/vi...</a> where I was able to find some discussion of bell weights and sounds, but none specific to the bells you're inquiring about.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps,<br>  -Jivechops
ZMBjlbTmaa	Alice was amazing, i think she was just right for the role!<br>  <br>  Emmet was great too, he wasnt so good on the acting side but he was PERFECT for emmet.<br>  <br>  Edward? He was a tad too creepy if you ask me, and of course it would be hard for someone to fill the roll of him. I still think Robert <br>  Pattison did a brilliant job of being Edward.<br>  <br>  Carilse, he was alright. Not perfect, but alright.<br>  <br>  Rosalie, Nikki Reeds acting was great, and she was gorgeous but isnt rolasie meant to be the most beautiful girl ever? They could have chosen someone better.<br>  <br>  Jasper, he was great, not perfect, he could have been taller and a little better looking, but hey.<br>  <br>  Esme. great!<br>  <br>  James, Vicotoria and Laurent, awesome!!<br>  <br>  Charlie, great!<br>  <br>  Jacob? alright.<br>  <br>  Bella? i think they could have chosen someone more 'fragile' looking.<br>  <br>  Great movie!|`|eJwzR8I2aa	i actually really like kristen stewart who played bella,i think she is perfect for the part. :] but my fav is kellan who played emmett!!!!!!! :] least i would say maybe jasper,the guy that plays him doesnt pull off blonde very well....|`|dPi7zMxWaa	Edward and Bella I agree with you they did have the wrong person as Bella but I still love her character|`|8miXPCYgaa	the one that says 'this movie sucks, and anyone who likes this movie is a retard'.|`|y59rikGIaa	ur so right they got bella ALL wrong! she nods way to much and its to dramatic! jasper was definitly good and so was alice but emmet wasnt as i expected but hes still good. my favorite actor was of course alice for me. i think my least favorite character(s) were edward & bella. bella was so wrong for it. and edward doesnt really have that certain charm but hes still ok. in my opinion even though in the book it describes him way different i think it should be Hayden Christensen. hes blonde with blue eyes but is gorgeous! and idk who shud be bella. there isnt really any1 in my mind for bella yet. :P|`|Ma5CuLfBaa	My favourites are Alice (ashley greene) and Jasper (Jackson Rathbone).

Keep voting 4 quest!<br>  Do it NOW!|`|f45b8ff41e1fa90ae65c8a0db95a90d1aa	i LOVE both crews but im voting for beat freaks|`|VHi7Kaokaa	QUEST CREW <33333333333<br>  they're amazing <br>  everyone vote for them! lol|`|wLe7nBLGaa	quest crew!!!!<br>  <br>  quest wasn't jus good in the last show...every performance they did got better. the tricks got harder and the routines were jus plan out sick.<br>  <br>  the hollowback jus defyed gravity. the elbow flares!! beat freakz can't touch that. yes they are a good b-girl group but all they did was normal tricks. <br>  quest crew!!!!|`|d2a20c0d2668e55c814a94412765a979aa	QUEST CREW !<br>  they are simply amazing.|`|hWGniz9Waa	QUEST CREW BITCHES!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|IFnyC2naaa	Beat Freaks|`|3OxRWGXVaa	Ever since the beginning, i've been rooting for quest and beat freaks... And i used to aim a lil more for beat freaks, but 2nite, Quest did SOOO AMAZING!!! I mean, beat freaks are awesome too, but it seems like all they can do are a bunch of B-boy dances and wut not. Quest crew can do a variety of dances and can even put out emotion in their dancing thru their "acting"... It's a bit of a toughy, but Im aiming for Quest Crew too =]|`|p5BVSIexaa	Beat freaks bc they are a brand new female group who can actually move..Yes quest crew can move, but to me they would be another Jabawokees<br>  Besides beat freaks look like they are actually trying and really wanting to win compared to quest crew who think that america will automatically vote for them bc of their looks|`|TLOrHmzHaa	ok seriously i dont kno how yal choose beat freakz over quest ... just becuz they r an all girl crew doesnt mean they should win thats just biased bullshit right there ... first episode quest defintily killd it ... BF is good 2 but they dont "wow" me as much as quest did ... only time BF got my attention was with the floating ball and the one after that ... other times wasnt all that great ... quest even on their bad day was still better than theirs ... QUEST all the wayyyy|`|bR4GvUWQaa	no QUESTions asked! Quest crew for the win they deserve it. i love their performances, very animated with a lot of humor...QUEST!!!|`|tL9KmxbNaa	QUEST CREW IS WAAAAAY BETTER!<br>  <br>  VOTE FOR QUEST!|`|hf5RgDzwaa	QUEST!!!!!<br>  they do some damn hot moves!!!<br>  and you cant tell me that isnt attractive :D|`|KGfCdnQyaa	i hope quest crew wins|`|8miXPCYgaa	ITS ALL BOUT DA BEAT FREAKS MAN|`|nzEhV2TWaa	I know what you mean.  Idk who to vote for or who I want to win. Idk whether we should all go by over all performance or that one last performance.<br>  <br>  Beat Freaks is one awesome girl group, and it makes me wonder if there will be any girl group who will as awesome as them if they didn't win this season. However Quest group is also awesome...that last performance was phenomenal!<br>  <br>  Let's see if we break it down...<br>  <br>  On the 1st ep: Sudden Death Challenge~Both crews were awesome; however Beat Freak has the standing ovation by the judges<br>  2nd ep: Fit Test Challenge ~ Beat Freaks was better<br>  3rd ep: Britney Challenge ~ Both crews were awesome<br>  4th ep: Whack Track Challenge ~ Both crews were awesome<br>  5th ep: Illusion Challenge ~ Beat Freaks was better<br>  6th ep: Battle of the sexes ~ Both crews were awesome<br>  7th ep: Hip Hop Decathlon Challenge ~ They were both awesome but Quest Crew turned out much better of the two (even had standing ovation by the judges)<br>  Last Performance ~ Quest crew was the the best of the two<br>  <br>  Hahahah! That breakdown did not help at all.  They are both equally good.|`|3zWfESBwaa	Quest crew for sure. They were amazing all season, the only performances I absolutely loved from bf were their first performance, the illusion, and the hot n' cold performance(but just the beginning). They are an amazing crew and prove females can rock the stage just as well as men can, but imo they aren't the best crew on the show. For the first time this season Quest Crew and Beat Freaks were compared fairly. They were given the same tasks and same music. And now that all is fair, look who came out on top, look who got their name chanted and the whole crowd and all the judges to stand on their feet. And Anthony proved a good point, i think bfs want this, but they aren't hungry for it. Quest has been waiting to be able to enter this competition since the first season, but due to contracts they couldn't (in addition to other things). <br>  <br>  Quest Crew all the way, if they don't win the producers made the wrong choice. No Questions Asked.|`|L0EXjK66aa	OK, I have supported both BF and QC since the beginning.  But, leaning towards BF because they were really good.  then I learned they were professional dancers and was a little disappointed.  But, I still thought they were the best crew.  THEN last night's show happened and it was all OVER for me. Quest Crew KILLED their performances and sadly the Beat Freaks kind of bored me.  <br>  <br>  My thing is the judges had them so amped after every episode that they played it way too safe.  Stuck with the B-boying for the last challenge and forgot to incorporate the other things that got them there.  On the other hand Quest Crew often got negative feedback and they used it to motivate them the next week.  Last week Shane said the BF are on your A$$E$ right now! QC came back and said OK let's show him how this should be done. Absolutely SICK performances by QC and they deserve to win.<br>  <br>  I am afraid MTV will give it to the BF but I don't think they deserve to win.  There last performances were kind of sloppy, boring and not as good as QC! It's the last show, you can not make the Last show your worst one! LIL MAMA kept it REAL 4 sure when she said this was not your Best performance!|`|AA11616164	QUEST CREW. Quest was original and they did unique and eye-popping moves that beat freakz didn't do. Beat freakz were unfair and kept spinning their head after the 1 minute was obviously OVER. Their illusion was weak, they moved their hands and danced around a flying ball with Quest actually had to STAB someone and make it look real. Beat freakz look like they have the same movement ever episode, and there's nothing special to it. Sure, they're good at dancing, but when it comes to winning the title, Quest wins hands down. Beat Freakz in episode seven played safe and the ending of their dance was nothing special, but a blow to the camera. Plus, Quest crew OWNED Beat Freakz in the head spinning. Quest can do so many more moves and flips that Beat Freakz could imagine, VQTE FOR QUEST!<br>  <br>  +Beat freakz were mean. They hit a pinata while saying that it was Quest crew! i mean, what kind of sportsmanship IS that?|`|R1UzJMXpaa	BEAT FREAKS ALL THE WAY!!! You cannot change your opinion about  a dance group after one night! Didn't you watch the last episodes with Beat Freaks? They had 0 negative comments, and Quest Crew had countless of them. Beat Freaks are great, not just because they are all females, but because they are very athletic on their own way. <br>  <br>  People used to say girls can't break, but Beat Freaks proved those ignorant people wrong. <br>  <br>  If you closely watch Quest Crew, the judges are right, they pose too much. They always think about what to do next that's why.<br>  <br>  Yes, they are entertaining, but for the past episodes, Beat Freaks have owned their BUTT! Even Shane said it in one of the episodes.<br>  <br>  "KayGee"- Did you watch the womanizer episode of Beat Freaks? They danced like boys in the beginning, but towards the middle-end, they danced like girls who know how to shake their body.<br>  <br>  <br>  FREAK THE VOTE!!! FREAK THE VOTE!!! FREAK THE VOTE!!!|`|2xf9BT5maa	Both crews deserve the title of ABDC. I've been going on & off with beat freaks & quest crew. after the decathalon; i think quest crew deserves the title. now alot of you are talking about quest crew already being famous for sytycd & ai; and everyone knows who they are, look at beat freaks. no one knew them as a crew but as individual dancers, yes. rino used to be the harajuku girl for gwen stefani; teresa used to be britney spears' dancer; shorty was in step up 2; maryss is hannah montana's dancer; etc. BOTH crews are pretty famous if you ask me. I think it'll be amazing if beat freaks won because they are the best female deancers i have ever seen in my life; but i think quest crew wants it more. why? Beat freaks didn't audition for the show, they were INVITED to be on the show; so if it wasnt for that they would have never been on the show; Quest crew auditioned for the show because they are HUNGRY for this. If you ask me, Quest Deserves it more. I love Beat Freaks though; no disrespect to anyone; but Quest deserves it more no matter how many times Shane says that Beat Freaks should be named ABDC. But I have a strong feeling that BF is gonna take the title, & i have NO problem with that. Both crews are amazing & i will be sad for the crew that doesn't win. This was the best season ever crew-wise; i just hated how short this season was & the fact that there was no championship showdown like season 2.|`|El4XqmVZaa	Beat Freaks! I think they bring something new to the table! It's an all female group and they bring it hot every week. Sure tonight's performance was not their best, but they do keep you entertained the entire time!  I think it is time for an all female group to win and if one group deserves the win the most it's the Beat Freaks!|`|wHIWV653aa	This episode was amazing. Beat Freaks and Quest both had great performances throughout this season. Though the judges were a bit harsh on Quest, they still were great. We all knew Fly Khickz were gonna be eliminated (should have happened a long time ago though), but some of us doubted it because the finale would be West Coast vs West Coast-in the past seasons, it never has been. Heck, I thought it would be rigged too. But I noticed that their main focus was a Girls vs Guys thing for the title.<br>  <br>  <br>  Quest's performance today was incredible. There was never a boring moment. As for Beat Freaks, I didn't have the same feeling. I think it was just me, but that's how I feel. Their performance was great too, but I liked Quest's better. It had a sort of ring to it.<br>  <br>  Standing Ovation for Quest today, finally.<br>  <br>  Quest, Season 3 <3|`|D4jlIuOMaa	Beat Freaks are gonna take it all the way. F R E A K T H E V O T E<br>  <br>  Quest Crew is good too but they made alot of mistakes in the past. You can't just base your decision on just ONE episode. People who are just NOW changing your minds after this one performance... HAVE YOU SEEN THE OTHER PERFORMANCES FROM PREVIOUS WEEKS?! THEY KILLED EVERY ONE OF THEM. <br>  <br>  &Someone made a comment down there about SOME of the BFs being professional dancers? LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T HEARD OF QUEST CREW and how they've been on SYTYCD and AMERICAN IDOL... &all these other shows. So when I saw them on the first episode of ABDC this season I already know who they were and heard of them. So they are already known publicly. SO I WASN'T AS SHOCKED BY THEIR DANCING.<br>  <br>  BEATFREAKS, maaaan. I know alot of people haven't heard of them before... so when they came out, alot of people were shocked and surprised that there's this ALL-FEMALE group kickin' not only butt... but the boys butt. They sacrficed alot to be on ABDC. So THEY DESERVE IT.<br>  <br>  Quest Crew winning is gonna feel like all the other seasons. Boys always winning. Sure they had good performances but BEAT FREAKS TOOK IT THIS WHOLE SEASON. <br>  <br>  SO BE SMART AND DON'T BASE WHO YOU'RE GONNA VOTE FOR ALL ON JUST ONE EPISODE. BEAT FREAKS WILL BLOW YOU AWAY. SO FREAK THE VOTE! BEAT FREAKS FANS... KEEP ON VOTING EVERY CHANCE YOU GET. <br>  **REMEMBER, BEAT FREAKS REALLY REPRESENTED THE WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD.... THEY MADE IT PUBLICLY KNOWN THAT WHATEVER BOYS CAN DO, GIRLS CAN DO IT TWICE AS BETTER.|`|wfUJypjFaa	omg ... its gota b QUEST CREW because u gotta look at the performance not the GENDER ,,....<br>  quest CREW LAST PERFORMANCE WUZ insane .... they totaly destroyed beAT freaks .... <br>  MY VOTE IS FOR quest crew  ALL THE WAY >>>! !! ... <br>  they GOTTA .. win if they dont this show is staright ridiculouse|`|Q4lneWIvaa	Of course Quest crew, their performances are always outstanding and they did for me.

If it's a hit, Fox may try to capitalize on that by renewing TSCC for a 13 episode run next season.  If the ratings improve due to movie fans checking it out, it may survive.  Ditto if the ratings only go up a little but it brings in a good demo.  Otherwise it's dead.  The show is too expensive to produce for such little return.|`|HEs6bzOtaa	i have a feeling it will, getting bored of that show|`|5IpRLVDPaa	Give Dollhouse some time.

ZyGyDLsDaa	I don't want to spoil the movie for you, but you have seen some of the main parts. Below is a fairly detailed summary of the film, one I've watched at least 20 times in the past year or so. <br>  <br>  Population 436 (2006)<br>  aka Population/436<br>  IMDb synopsis: ***SPOILERS***<br>  Steve Kady (Jeremy Sisto), a U.S. Census Bureau researcher, is sent to the remote and seemingly idyllic village of Rockwell Falls to interview residents concerning the population. On the way, his car hits a pothole and bursts a tire. He is picked up by Bobby Caine (Fred Durst), sheriff's deputy, who drives him into town and helps him find a place to stay. Kady notices a number of increasingly strange things: People make vague allusions to "the fever", and several residents treat him as though he is not a visitor but has moved to Rockwell Falls permanently. His research reveals that the town's population has remained at exactly 436 for more than 100 years. <br>  Kady becomes romantically involved with Courtney Lovatt (Charlotte Sullivan), a local woman and the daughter of his host, much to the chagrin of Caine, who also is in love with her. He also befriends Amanda, a young girl whose father was killed trying to escape the town and who is being held at Dr. Greaver's clinic on the pretext of treating her for schizophrenia. Courtney and Amanda both express a desire to leave town but are afraid of the consequences of trying. Later, when threatened with "treatment" himself, Kady escapes the clinic, rescuing Amanda, but is forced to leave Courtney behind after discovering that she has been lobotomized. As a storm grows, Kady and Amanda flee town in a stolen tow-truck. Suddenly, he sees the cross then the doll from his recurrent dreams. Without warning, a truck appears, smashing head-on into them. The film ends with one of Kady's co-workers arriving in search of him and being picked up by police officers after his car breaks down, echoing the beginning of the film.<br>  <br>  Here's the movie trailer:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0eb6iDSpow" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0eb6iDSp...</a><br>  Here's Part 1 of the movie:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3pqMy2hgIc&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3pqMy2hg...</a><br>  <br>  I hope I didn't spoil any surprises. Yes, this IS a good film! Once you know the ending, you'll be on the lookout for hints of what's to come. This film definitely deserves several viewings, and even then you might not be able to decide: Are the villagers crazy, or do they have a pact with God or someone else?<br>  <br>  NOTE: I did have to reread your description several times and at first was thrown by the reference to his little sister. But, these are great clues: the "perky" family locked up in the cellar, the girl with the hole in her head acting like a robot, and the crash near the end of the film. Gosh! I LOVE this movie!

qYeBBrYYaa	Intelligence Quotient: IT'S A TEST TO SEE HOW SMART YOU REALLY ARE IT MEASURES YOUR INTELLIGENCE|`|W1xs3vYBaa	IQ is a test that is suppose to calculate a persons capability of mind. It has to be administered by a trained professional. <br>  <br>  95% of the population will have an IQ score of 85 to 115. The score is based on the bell curve and the top of the bell curve, average, is found at 100 with a standard deviation, +/- 15, on either side. <br>  <br>  Anything below 85 points and a person has some form of mental deficits. While anything above 115 means that person is "bright", can solve problems in a quick and accurate manner, and overall has mental surpluses. <br>  <br>  The Highest IQ range is held by M, V. Savant with her IQ being between 168 to 228. <br>  <br>  To get a real test you should go to your local high school or university and ask them for the contact information for professional administrators.|`|04118ae23b43083371f655128f6eb539aa	Is english your native launge?  You might have a tough time.  <br>  The test measures intelleigence.  It is flawed.<br>  It says that a score of 100 is the median.  Above score means your are more intelligent, below your are less intelligent.  The flaw is culturaly differences.  It has been proven wrong.  Imagine my disappointment when I scored 125 and I was told I was not working to my capabilities in High School. Thank you.

CwrayzxBaa	While nobody can know the pain you feel right now, we can all sympathise.  While I'm older and the songs I would choose to listen to are probably considered ancient now, they still have the same impact they always did.  I would also suggest songs with feeling. So my suggestions for you are:<br>  <br>  1.  Simon & Garfunkel - anything from the concert in central park album.<br>  especially - the Boxer, Bridge over troubled water, the sound of silence.<br>  2. Peter Gabriel & Kate Bush - Don't Give Up.<br>  3. Forest Gump - Feather Theme<br>  4. Mama Cass - Dream a little dream of me (this is my favourite)<br>  5. Elton John - Candle in the wind<br>  6. John Denver - Vincent (Starry starry night)<br>  7. Beatles - Hey Jude<br>  8. Laura Branigan - How am I supposed to live without you?<br>  9. Olivia Newton John - Honestly, I love you.<br>  10. Foreigner - I don't want to live without you.<br>  11. Monty Python - always look on the bright side of life.<br>  12. Tarrega - Memories of the Alhambra<br>  13. Celine Dione - My heart will go on (ok its cheesy but it works ok)<br>  14. Izrael Kamakawiwo'ole - Somewhere over the rainbow<br>  15. Judie Tzuke - Stay with me till dawn<br>  16. Fred Astaire - They can't take that away from me.<br>  17. Cindy Lauper - Time after time<br>  18. Righteous Brothers - unchained melody<br>  19. Ordinary people theme - Canon in D<br>  20. Gymnopedie No.1<br>  21. A Beautiful Mind theme - Mozart: Piano Sonata 11 in A K331<br>  22. Band of Brothers theme - Requiem for a Soldier<br>  23. Lord of the Rings theme - May it be.|`|GS20sIkMaa	Spirit in the sky by Norman Greenbaum<br>  God bless from NZ|`|ICOmnGIUaa	o i am so sorry to here that. some good songs that you could possibly listen to are here without you by 3 doors down... angels on the moon by thriving ivory...possibly, almost easy by avenged sevonfold.<br>  <br>  hope you can get through this, again i am very sorry for your loss.|`|y34fsveIaa	im sorry for your loss<br>  but look at all of simple plan's song's<br>  like....they all have emotion in it<br>  and if im in a bad mood or having a horrible day i listen to them<br>  just look at the song titles and it explains the song, ahha|`|2QBHT8Azaa	I'm real sorry... this must be hard for you.<br>  Ya, simple plan is the way to go.<br>  three days grace gives a feeling of isolation<br>  linkin park just sings about why they are pissed off at the moment.|`|xo5rqZ2Caa	James Blunt|`|fZgDE5Hcaa	Welcome to my life - simple plan<br>  its weird cuz this song  is wut i liosten to when im depressed and i really like the lyrics, dont know ahy but it just makes me feel better when im down. and sry to hear.|`|zEK0wlW5aa	who'd you be today  -- kenny chesney<br>  <br>  in my small  town we've had 3 suicides and one motorcycle accident within 3 years. its hard. im sorry for the loss.

The composer is Jonathan Elias."|`|Hki3AoL5aa	the 1st guy is talking about the wrong ad who ever sent that inquiry to customer service was taling about the superbowl ad not this one.  I have been trying to find the music as well and cannot find it.|`|Ev8mV0EVaa	I know. I am looking for that song too. This is just a guess, but it sounds like a band from the early nineties called "Lush". 4AD Records was known for making bands sound like this. It's an educated guess but I could be wrong.

I'm a huge Lush fan, and I know for certain it isn't them. It certainly has a shoegaze quality to it though, from the few seconds I've heard in the commercial. I MUST find this song!!!|`|qVKVjlxraa	I don't think feelflow is right on that one. That was a response to a different commercial, not the one with the woman singing.

sQqQT85Raa	Though that wasn't a good decision, I know many many MANY people in high school who pierce with a safety pin and they've turned out fine! <br>  <br>  However, you must remember to keep it very clean, regardless of how you pierce it. Though people say to use mouthwash, that actually makes it worse by killing the germs you need to heal. Try H2Ocean, which you can find at any Hot Topic, though they have way better deals at H2Ocean.com. I got a 16oz. bottle for only $10, where Hot Topic sells a 8oz. bottle for $10! Also keep the outside clean with Neosporin. This you can find at any Target, Rite Aid, CVS, etc. Lymph (crusties) is a sign that your healing. Unless it's yellow or it smells, don't worry. Your lip will be swollen for a few days and it might be hard to talk. (I couldn't enunciate my F's when I first got my lip ring!)<br>  <br>  You should also try to change the stud earring into an actual lip ring. The backing of the stud might actually irritate your gums or teeth and cause problems.<br>  <br>  Hopefully everything will turn out for the better. Goodluck :]|`|LhHAkqGiaa	Um, no, you shouldn't have pierced your lip with a saftey pin. It's going to turn all black and get infected and pusfilled and sht now. And that's your mouth.<br>  <br>  ew.|`|PfXuyIT1aa	I hope you really didn't do this! A safety pin isn't sterile, you could end up with blood poisoning and the earring is not suitable for a lip piercing. If you have done this go to a G.P. straight away!
Z15TM1VQaa	Tail of the Moon aka: Tsuki no Shippo<br>  Becoming a ninja is the best think that can happen for fifteen year old Usagi, but it’s impossible! Usagi is only good with herbs and making medicine, she can’t even do the basic things all ninjas know and everyone knows that. The only thing is she wants to be a ninja so she can go on missions and leave the small village she has always lived in. One day Usagi’s great grandfather (the leader of the village) tells her that he has an assignment that only she can do, “marry Hanzo Hattori and bare his children”. Usagi along with Mamezo (a child she has raised from a young age) go to Segachi, the place Hanzo lives at. Hanzo instantly rejects Usagi the moment he finds out why she came, but she doesn’t leave and he is made her ninja instructor by… Her grandfather? With love on the horizon, enemies almost around every corner, a strict teacher, and her ex-fiancé Goemon around all the time, will she be able to do such a treacherous life-long task?<br>  <br>  Tokyo Crazy Paradise<br>  After the death of her parents, Tsukasa turns to her classmate Ryuji, a yakuza boss, for shelter and a job.

Tsukasa is a simple-minded girl who desperately searches for money to pay off her debts to Ryuji. To make money, she takes on suspicious jobs in addition to being Ryuji's bodyguard, but always ends up in trouble. Ryuji and Tsukasa take turns saving each other as they fight together against the spread of dangerous drugs and weaponry that would destroy Tokyo even more than it has already degraded.<br>  <br>  Love Monster<br>  After failing her high school entrance exam, Hiyo Osora becomes desperate; so when she receives an acceptance letter from the prestigious SM Academy it is like a godsend.

The sinister secret society known as Demon Card is using the power of Dark Bring to destroy everything in their path. The only things capable of stopping Dark Bring are the Rave stones. Unfortunately, the Rave Stones were scattered around the globe in an explosion 50 years ago, so now they must be collected by the Rave Master in order to stop Dark Bring once and for all. This new task has been given to Haru Glory; a sixteen-year-old boy from Garage Island. The World's fate now rests on the new, young Rave Master.<br>  <br>  Kare Kano aka: Kareshi Kanojou<br>  Yukino had it all. Brilliant, athletic, popular and pretty, she was the perfect school girl with many friends and admirers. But then one fateful day she met her match: a handsome young man named Arima. Now, not only is he beating her at her own game, she's becoming more and more dismayed to learn that she's developing her first real feelings of romance. Can Yukino maintain her model student appearance, or will love ruin all her plans?<br>  <br>  Backstage Prince<br>  Akari has no interest in Kabuki Theatre, but suddenly she finds herself as the assistant of seventeen-year-old Ryusei Horiuchi, a famous young kabuki actor.

Akari and Ryusei's relationship is difficult at the beginning, but eventually the two find themselves falling in love.

Can Yuiko tame this wild beast, or will he run just like all the other animals she loves?<br>  <br>  Wish<br>  Shuichiro Kudo is a man who has everything he wants from life: a job as successful doctor and his own home. However one evening he finds a tiny angel trapped on a branch and frees him. The angel, named Kohaku, offers Shuichiro a wish in return for saving him, but Shuichiro wants nothing. Kohaku however, is determined that there has to be a wish Shuichiro cannot grant by himself and follows him home. Kohaku reveals that he has left heaven to locate another angel, Hisui who has abandoned heaven, but a devil and his two catty servants constantly hinder Kohaku's search! Will Kohaku find Hisui and will Shuichiro realize that some wishes can only be granted by others?<br>  <br>  Loveless<br>  Ritsuka Aoyagi's psyche is in dire straits; his mother is insane, his brother Seimei has been killed, and over the past few years he's seemed to become a different person. When the enigmatic Soubi Agatsuma arrives, claiming to have information about Seimei's death, Ritsuka is determined to uncover the truth. Soon, however, he is caught up in a web of darkness and spell battles, all the while searching for the reason behind his own personality change. Wary and defensive, Ritsuka is unnerved by his relationship with Soubi, as well as the tentative friendships offered to him by his classmates. But the world of spell battles, fighter units and sacrifices is an ugly place; and Ritsuka, in the middle of it all, finds himself having to choose who to trust.|`|clPvtugSaa	Maybe the one make your happy.o(∩_∩)o...<br>  I do enjoy many different kinds of manga at <a href="http://www.mangafox.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.mangafox.com.</a><br>  You can go there to find the one fit for your teast.

The different track listings is just because they have a normal album and Special Edition album, they aren't really much different except the Special Edition has extra tracks.<br>  <br>  You may also be looking at the new Answer album that is coming out in a few days, not Rise.<br>  <br>  But yeah, if you really like them then get the Special Edition, but if you are just getting into them then I would just get the standard album.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|msOABQbSaa	Look up the band on wikipedia, generally the track listing is on there for albums and its pretty accurate.

A beautiful woman like Rhianna, I hope she isn't stupid as well.<br>  <br>  He will tell her how wrong he was, he will never do it again, he will beg, tell her that she is the only one, all that cr*p. She will probably believe every stupid word out of his mouth, feel sorry for him and take him back. the judge will go easy on him because he is a celebrity. In time he will do it again only worse.

You just need to retrain that pinky to do what you want it to. Some of the best (arguably) players in the world came back from devastating accidents. Les Paul broke his arm in a car wreck, and had the doctor permanently set the arm at a 90 degree angle so he could still play. Django Rhienhardt (not sure of the spelling) could only use three of his fingers. Both are considered to be great jazz players. Tony Iommi lost the tips to two of his fingers. He had rubber tips made for them. Many think this gave Black Sabbath it's signature sound.<br>  <br>  I knew a local guy where I life that had been shot in his left hand. As a result he could only use the thumb, first and pinky fingers, and was d*mned good picker. <br>  <br>  Or you could always go lefty. I'm a right handed player but I have a couple of lefty guitars. Just because.|`|Um9jbMPgaa	My pinky also tends to not wanna be independent. However, a few exercises i do that work is basically scale work.<br>  <br>  To put into words is kinda difficult but i'll give it a go.<br>  <br>  Go to the first fret of the top string and position you rindex finger there. Also position ur middle, ring and pinky finger over frets 2,3,4. Then simply play 1234 on the top string and each string down then back up.

e7KoyoWsaa	well dude, artificial pinch harmonics are hard.  If your having trouble doing them you just need to practice.  Make sure you've got it going through a lead distortion and your not on the bass pickup. After that practice and practice.  It's all in how you pluck the string and pinch it with your thumb.  The fact that your double jointed won't hinder you, it's just the way you hold you pick.

Sheet music is for jazz, classical and piano music.  97% of the sheet music in the world is for those.  If you want sheet music for that, you've got about a .001% chance that someone out there has made sheet music for a European boy band; if not, then you have to make it on your own

Ftkr9jqYaa	From day one, I knew there was something in you that no other guy has. I had always searched for my blonde hair, blue eyed, tan guy ... and dreamt of having my fairytale wedding. Baby, you don't have blonde hair or blue eyes - but you're perfect! From your gorgeous smile, to your warm, loving eyes, to your strong arms, to the way your hands fit mine.<br>  <br>  I was scared to love you after everyone said we wouldn't even make it two weeks, but we did. After we passed those first two weeks I knew there was something that just worked between us. We made it through the best months of my life, and then that's when you left. Now you are far away and I can't be with you. Although this will be the hardest months of my life, I would wait forever to be in your arms again. Once again, we have people saying that there's no way we will make it through this, but I think we can prove them wrong. <br>  <br>  I live for you, and only you. I dream of the day that I can be your wife. I want so badly for that dream of mine to come true; you have no idea, Sweetie. When we talk about getting married, and having kids together, my heart melts. I know that I'm young and you want what's best for me, but I know in my heart, you are the best thing that has ever and will ever happen to me.<br>  <br>  You have taught me so much about myself and the way that I should live my life. You have taught me things that will eventually help me grow into the type of person I need to be, and you have taught me to love without holding back.<br>  <br>  You have been my sweetest sin since day one. My parents didn't want us to last, some "friends" didn't want us to last and that's great for them, - back to the sweetest sin thing - you have no idea what it's like to be me when I get to sleep with you, to feel your hands caressing my body, feeling your body next to mine. It's this feeling I get being that close to you, the feeling that I am the safest person in the world - Oh, screw this! I love you! You are the one for me and you know all of this - I'll say this numerous times until I turn blue in the face; marry me! You know I don't mean now, just some day! I love you!! <br>  <br>  Love always,

BUT I have found some real bargains also.  Like the beautiful home made, hand carved, antique four poster king size bed I found piled in the back of a of a dusty old junk store.  I paid $20 for it.

Danny De Vito and F Murray Abraham promised to set up a meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger to discuss white elephants, but lo and behold, they send Steven Seagal instead. Now I respect Steven Seagal for his contributions to the war on terror in such classics as 'Under Siege', but I was really looking for a Major 'Dutch' Schaefer to handle my white elephant requirements. This would've all been acceptable, but Steven Seagal abruptly left to shoot some orphans in the face about 15 minutes into the consultation, which was really inconsiderate, and Jean-Claude Van Damme took his place. Jean-Claude was polite and most courteous, but what I really wanted was the original meeting with Arnold Schwarzenegger. So I called Dolph Lundgren and asked him to ask Chuck Norris if anybody had seen Mr. Schwarzenegger, but he was far too busy kicking old age pensioners to fully concentrate on Dolph's reasonable request. Jean-Claude Van Damme, angered at his seemingly inferior status as Chad/Alex Wagner to Schwarzenegger's Major 'Dutch' Schaefer completely flipped out and immediately stripped my wallet of ￡5.83, precisely 1/1000th of the cost of a white elephant. Don't deal with these crooks.|`|NLsaNo6taa	no, not lately. hubby and were supposed to go out and about last evening but the weather turned remarkably bad so we decided against it. we were going to go to this used bookstore up near Corunna, (Michigan) called 'Jellybeans" of all things.... i LOVE used bookstores.|`|AA10851908	No,but I did just get rid of a big green Elephant.A engine from a 1967 Pontiac Catalina 389.|`|Myhkeqsaaa	I was thinking about buying a White Elephant...<br>  But then i realised it probably wouldn't be able to get it into my flat.|`|vnyqmTJDaa	yes|`|wmBK9uASaa	Not yet ,love jumble sales|`|16bdbaab82deed99b2989cb05584df60aa	Not been 2 one of those in years

I think that in general, The Beatles are hard to resist, their music is just to "friendly".<br>  In general, i would say bands like Ac Dc, Iron Maiden, Metallica, Nirvana are hard not to like. Thats why they are mainstream.|`|4zscfvvoaa	Well, the historic bands that you have to respect even if you don't like them are The Beatles.<br>  <br>  The artist that I hate, don't like his music, but have to like, is Al Di Meiola.

7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	I take it occasionally, and have never had a problem, but my mother did.<br>  She went on vacation with my Dad, and it was the first night in the house they rented.  My Mom took ambien right before bed, and then woke up at 2:00 in the morning, got up, and started frantically putting her clothes back into her suitcase.  My Dad woke up and asked her what she was doing, and she said "Hurry up!  We're going to miss our plane!"  My Dad was like, "We don't have a plane to catch...we're already here."  but he had a really hard time getting through to her.  She was walking around half the night...packing and unpacking clothes, putting on makeup...she had no idea what she was doing.<br>  My Dad flushed the rest of the medication down the toilet.  He's still traumatized by the incident.|`|n00kRXVYaa	i went to the doctors today and they give me ambien b/c im having a hard time sleeping okay now im nervous to take it|`|x6rHjPIIaa	yea my mom took it and started talking about Dumbo and then ran into a pole....|`|AA11108627	I don't know if this qualifies as "bizarre"...<br>  <br>   ... but I was just prescribed Ambien to deal with my insomnia.  And at last I'm sleeping -- but whether I take the pill at 10pm, midnight, or 2:59 AM, I still never drop off to sleep before 3AM each night! <br>  <br>  Now I can't wait to see what other fallout will occur.  Maybe I'll start meeting some of you on my future sleepwalks.  See you all @ 3:15 sharp this morning, OK?  I'll be the one with the blue/grey striped PJ's!

Z5mmaFK0aa	Alexi isn't even that good or fast period. Not fast at all. I am not going to bash to hard on him I know your a fan bro. But Brian (Buckethead) has WAY more skill than Laiho. Way faster as well. Trust me if there is anyone that would on here its me. I hope that didn't sound arrogant but I think its clear I know what I am talking about.<br>  <br>  edit<br>  I hear you man. Hey he doesnt suck hands down. Maybe I am biased because of his attatude. Lets just say Brian has more skill.|`|kP0JGI1waa	Um i am not hating or anything but Alexi is not even close to being the fastest guitarist ever.  Buckethead is fast I will give you that but Laiho, despite being solid, is not the fastest. (see Michael Angelo Batio, Shawn Lane, Chris Impelltteri, John Petrucci, etc).<br>  <br>  Who is better?...I personally like Laiho's style better, plus he can do some nice vocals on top of that.

in both genres - going out 1960/1975<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I really immersed myself in the "up-&-at-'em" spirit of both genres<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just as I had as a kid in that era: I always had my nose in books, & comics, that took me outa my mundane, meagre, ancient tumbledown flat <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  & transported me into a world of happy hope, firm faith, loyal love <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  & sheer dogged determination to overcome every obstacle, to succeed in sussing out the stepping stones hidden in every stumbling block & to triumph in every test, trial & tribulation<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  & sheer dogged determination began to rise up in me again, the more I researched this priceless project<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I soon found myself longing to inspire that same spirit in an audience that feel weighed down, battered, bruised & defeated by the Credit Crunch, by rising knife & gun crime & by fear of the Middle East crisis triggering Armageddon<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  & going to bed with those thoughts in mind, the ever-active subconscious activated the most amazing dreams about modern meanings to draw out of such seminal series as Gun Law, Rawhide, Wagon Train<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  & Animal Magic, Skippy & Lassie<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To say nothing of the kiddies cartoon shows that always allegorised human behaviour into the most awesome, amazing animal charactyers<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Huckleberry Hound Show had self contained segments of the seminal Pixie & Dixie: Yogi Bear became so popular that it got its own spin-off series that included sensational segments like Snagglepuss & Deputy Dawg<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Each & every one of 'em featured in a delightful series of 21st century remix-style dreams <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I tried to email paul.smith@7waves.co.uk & kyle.mansell@7waves.co.uk <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  But got mail fail notices<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  So >><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  in that resurrected pioneering spirit of Jolly Johnny Morris & the heroes of the Wild West ><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Saddle up, y'all >><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  We's goin' for the ride of a lifetime<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=golden+age+of+tv" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/results?search_qu...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Join us on that magic carpet roller-coaster ride, on the 3 Sunday evenings -

(having just ripped out the bath & old wash hand basin, leaving me with nowhere to wash, sat sttin' here in my 'jamas & dressing gown till they instal somewhere for me to wash) - I'll capitalise on these 2 days of primitive, raw, rowdy surroundings by hopefully gettin' to da studio by teatime tro record this -

FIG58FVpaa	Doing anything well is hot... If you don't play well, though... not so much.|`|d9iXONYsaa	Very.  That sort of ability is an extension of oneself.  If she can do that, she is every bit as beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside.|`|vxbzE9hNaa	f***ing yeah,<br>  a girl who can play piano and classical songs?!<br>  thats something|`|X5hTmAkBaa	yeah pops me atleast half a woody|`|di4ses4iaa	Yes girls playing any instrument is hot, especially one as complex as the piano.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	what about classical violin?|`|Y6IhTVW4aa	Totally.

AA10415600	shotgun.  50 story jump and you have to think about it all the way down|`|oqeoUKj2aa	I would say jumo because i always have dreams of me just falling down off a building, and it never seems to end....So i guess if i was going to die i would want to have time to pray to God, and to remember everything that has been good to me....Just everything that has made who you are|`|nHHpTefnaa	50 story jump! ive always wanted to try to fly|`|piI1aWOdaa	a hairdrier would finish you off snowman|`|KqxoYgUYaa	NEITHER. and anyone who suggests either.... well, you should be ashamed....<br>  <br>  Now, talking to you, I hope you realize that there are more ways out of problems than just quitting. Talk to people who care about you, I know how hard it can be when it seems like people don't care, but there are those that do, try not to push them away if you can help it... try to accept their help.|`|Bd2hVq8caa	jump..<br>  <br>  wish you would step off from that ledge my friend<br>  we could cut ties with all the lies that you've been livin in<br>  and<br>  if you do not want to see me again<br>  you should jump right now ow ow ow ow ow|`|T44Y0UuYaa	I would prefer a pistol/handgun to the face but they all end the same...so in other words...shotgun to the face|`|BS5GDXtqaa	shotgun<br>  faster|`|j6poSs16aa	shotgun (quicker)|`|sMvWJDqsaa	shotgun blast, much quicker|`|vxbzE9hNaa	i take the fast one!|`|ITSYwRTgaa	both?|`|WoDh8hD2aa	shotgun to the face...<br>  i would actually be less frightened with a gun in my face than i would be standing on a 50 story building... heights are my worst fear|`|YW1DXceqaa	whoa slow down there...i was gunna answer then i saw your avatar name...if you are considering suicide just don't do it. it ran through my mind here and there but one time half a sleep i felt death's cold hand im not joking..you will never get your life back and it's horrific ..seek a counselor
e41809d06ca21ebf8b0bf28ab33da9c8aa	I agree a little with Toast...<br>  <br>  I don't however think he is the best rapper at the present moment cause I have a few I think that are way better. He gets as much credit as he dishes out. I mean just like the other guy said also he needs to stop hooking up with people that just bring his whole vibe down. Like that new song "My Life"...I wanna like it but man Lil Wayne is just killing it for me. His voice is so unappealing to me. I mean I can see why Game took that direction with Lil Wayne cause he is in the lime light right now but I think he could have picked someone better. Just my opinion|`|1lvyUwo7aa	I don't think he is the best rapper out there. He does deserve more credit however. L.A.X. was the best album this year. Better than the "Paper Trail" or Tha Carter 3. He has some real stuff on there like "Game's Pain" or "My Life". |`|AA10784709	heres what i think about the game he's good if he doesn't hook up with crappy artist. I think his song my life isn't bad. but that's just me.
Ua1OiWmbaa	More than living up to it sunshine, I'm exceeding it.|`|89ff8fa4f5283b5a62c3ea573df41106aa	No not really|`|LgNqYUECaa	Yes I am.|`|jxMTRxgYaa	Not at the moment....I keep trying..one day..x|`|okz1fXf4aa	past it. way past it.|`|t8LBI66Paa	Naooo :\|`|zymllMsoaa	Nope..|`|hpkOeOLyaa	Nowhere near. I hate myself for it.|`|j6RbKNmjaa	Nope|`|8016ae03c067d43fbb6a3e29ebc0a2bbaa	no sunshine they wont let me.....lol
OPKbGXUFaa	I really like some of the clothing trends from the 80's.|`|uD9vEwP3aa	I like the natural-even-though-it-really-isn't-look... You know, gold and brown colors, eye liner on top, a little on bottom, pink glossy lips, and mascara.|`|Uy4BZUNgaa	Can Squirrel-y combine looks. I like the 80's with the bright neon colors and fun patterns along with the 40's fitted dresses and the beautiful up-do's.|`|e22d86889cb88baa6ecf401b1f6a584caa	Yeah I agree with you. On days when I don't feel like going all out with my make-up I just do a pin-up girl look with heavy eyeliner and a nice red tinted lip gloss.|`|qAfnWKQCaa	I guess the greaser look of the 50's was cool, although I don't dress like that. It's probably the only pop/counter culture trend I would have imitated, had I been alive back then.|`|Mp0MTuvDaa	your original sentiments sound good to me|`|LURqbzoZaa	I kinda like the emo look. But not with weird piercings and stuff.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	I'd say I have the sloppy look...my makeup is simple and boring...|`|a8U0UOeWaa	Giiiiirl yes! I agree :] Like...classy red lips, with dark smoky eyes. :] sometimes I like changing it up with pink lips though, but definitely with the smokey look. <br>  <br>  Also, with old hollywood glamour, the winged eye :] LOVE IT!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - Adriana :] <3|`|LZoDC4Tdaa	i like my look. its all original. its me all the way. lolz. <br>  <br>  people say that i have a slacker look. but idk. lolz. <br>  <br>  if i had to choose a timelined look i would go with the present urban look. thats just me tho.|`|uE2aOqeNaa	Futile japan! I also have always like the look of destruction. Like when you see a city that has been bombed, for some reason I get a feeling of "home" on the rubble.|`|4c770e93cae766d4352b51d99611c9c6aa	Anything Douglas Addams wrote, particularly The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy|`|APftKj7Saa	I like the, oh god help me spell this, - renaissance - clothing<br>  <br>  Phew :) XD|`|9GDBpl8Faa	I love the look that someone gets when they just don't care what other people think. Like wearing the plaid pageboy hats and hoop earrings with their hair in braided pigtails. That's my favorite look on me anyways. But as far as a look in time, there's just somethin' about the 50's look with the poodle skirts that is just plain awesome.|`|SkFgDxpEaa	idk what mine would be. as little make-up as possible, hehe. idk i do like the make-up look that i got for my wedding and stuff, you know which ones right tan?<br>  well i do love the old bollywood movies and the make-up they had then, it was around the 70's and 80's i think|`|AA12252260	Smoky eye, definitely! Because I'm Asian though, I don't have much of one (eyelids, that is). ;) <br>  <br>  I have to agree with you: the 40's had a unique look about it. I also enjoy the dresses back then in the Victorian age. I'd probably hate putting it on though.|`|snjdyvlmaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  The scruffy look.|`|f4ehvRQlaa	ones about vampires, health, etc...|`|B8Nz2KzXaa	Well,<br>  <br>  I like to look at pretty girls...<br>  <br>  or does that not count..<br>  <br>  -R
27f16a1a2275258802b78014bc189e59aa	it's accepted because it's easier. for the general public, everything must be simplified. if you incorporate moon signs, and what else have you, it begins to become too complicated for most people to comprehend.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	I agree with the first answer. Astrology needs to be simple for simple people. Most people don't even understand the complexity of it. <br>  <br>  Anyway I understand what you are saying. <br>  You need to look at everything for compatibility, not just sun signs.
90fe042f152a448203d237c9ed5abfc4aa	FINALLY! Thank you for posting a question concerning the positive traits of the Aries sun sign. I'm an Aries, Taurus moon, and Cancer/Leo rising. My gentle and softer side definitely overrides any aggression that is normally associated with the "Martian" temperament.<br>  <br>  I'm shy- AND an introvert. I am also infatuated with anything affiliated with the realm of love, and am a true romantic.I suppose a guy whose compassionate, patient, creative, honest, easygoing, and intelligent would make definitely make me melt...
pNUtnoC8aa	Yeah every now and then.|`|IkWRXHGXaa	Yes I have got BA a few time when it has went into voting.|`|FjiRPKp2aa	several times.|`|st2zmU88aa	yeah all the time, and i never voted on my answers..|`|rB3ypCO4aa	That has happened to me a LOT! I stopped voting for my answers a long time ago,but I always get voted BAs.Also,I noticed,I always have at least one 'thumbs up' for every answer I drop. Maybe I have a secret admirer...|`|AA11536708	Yes.  Quite a few.  Well not a lot, considering how long I have been doing this answers thing...hmmm...maybe I really just suck at it!|`|GBKmKmGiaa	Yeah. I don't define myself based on how many best answers I get on yahoo answers lol.|`|EPki0rwgaa	Heaps of times. It's pretty funny.|`|y29vSr4Zaa	YES!

3fVsb4NNaa	Because its really hot where they're going. |`|yGfEUx8baa	in the movie 3 it's was really hot as in the beginning it showed naruto groaning and walking weird and even sakura stated that they are in their summer clothes|`|xTUCIaJDaa	It was Summer, so it was hot. So their clothes are gonna be thinner and shorter, so instead of a jumpsuit, Naruto wore a t-shirt like-thing. And, it's a movie. So the animation will be slightly different. :D|`|99b672d984bc87eb9bbc85e0de1f218daa	That movie takes place like in the summer. So they're in their summer outfits, which is pretty awesome =)
Uv6fADcaaa	Im 20 and I look for...<br>  <br>  intelligence (he has to keep up with me intellectually)<br>  fairly liberal, open-minded (no homophobic,racist,sexist men)<br>  Either artistically or musically inclined<br>  No sports jocks<br>  A guy that is a bit of trouble, I know I'm trouble<br>  He must be able to handle my sarcasm and attitude, and hopefully come back at me with a few quips of his own.<br>  <br>  and a guy that is adaptable! Some nights I want to curl up and read, others I want to be in a mosh pit.

PZsC2161aa	This is more of an opinion than a question. My brother and I had this argument a few weeks ago. He was saying Maiden dominates because the band still tours like they did in the '80s (did you go to the Somewhere Lost in Time Tour?), while I argued that it was Judas Priest(did you go to their tour last year?) that influenced Maiden.<br>  <br>  Anyways, they are very distinct types of music. Yes, some might categorize them into NWBHM, but that is like saying that Venom is Black Metal. Iron Maiden is more melodic, with underlying tones based in literature and history. Off the top of my head, "Brave New World," "The Number of the Beast," 2 Minutes to Midnight" "Aces High," "The Evil that Men Do," "Hallowed Be Thy Name," "Phantom of the Opera" all have their roots based on books or history.<br>  <br>  Conversely, Judas Priest is more of a rebellious, with no real signature style. Turbo is more mainstream, Angel of Retribution is all over the place, British Steel and Angel of Retribution are pure metal, while Nostradamus is more Opera-leaning. <br>  <br>  I might have bored you, since I wrote a lot, but I am a huge fan of both, and I do not consider one to be of superior quality than the other. Heck, I even had a research article for uni based on Heavy Metal! Sometimes Priest is what you want to listen to ("Deal with the Devil," "Angel," "Grinder"), but other times, Maiden satisfies the craving for Metal ("Powerslave," "Wrathchild,"Prowler," "Killers," "Running Free"). <br>                                                                           J.

I think Michael jackson is a legend, generous, and one of the best entertainers of all time.<br>  <br>  by the ways the fleash eating disorder is just a rumour, its not true, and no doctor, or anybody that knows michael has confiremed it.<br>  Michael turned white because of an illness called vitiligo.<br>  <br>  I want more michael jackson.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	I never thought of that before. I think you've make a good deduction there, Sherlock! But I have to agree with the following responder that the strong similaries were not intentional. I've never read or heard that Rooster Cogburn was a remake of The African Queen--if that's what you are asking. Yes, Katherine Hepburn starred in both films and many more memorable ones, and, sadly, she's gone. On June 29, 2003, Hepburn died of natural causes at Fenwick, the Hepburn family home in Old Saybrook, Connecticut. She was 96 years old.|`|PW1vXqruaa	Not exactly at least, I'm not sure if that was the intent.

Forester and written for the screen by John Huston & James Agee.<br>  <br>  "Rooster Cogburn" was written by Martha Hyer.

And why isn't Starr in school? and Cole in the rehab facility, aka a hotel!|`|vwl0n8vQaa	She took him to LaBoulai and will lock him in her room until he dries out (or whatever you call it).  Sweat it out, I guess.  They're both dumb to do this.|`|nIMx9Dwbaa	They're kids and behaving as so!  She's doing what she thinks is best to help Cole and also find out about their baby!|`|7XM4QJiuaa	I know! What was that girl thinking?|`|AA11461751	eep in mind Starr has always tried to address adult problems lie a grown-up, she has been doing this sice she was old enough to talk. Comes from having a Daddy like Todd,and remember cole was suppose to be all cleaned up do to re-hab,clean urine etc..why would she think he was having withdrawels?>|`|UY3zl9dFaa	I'm sure it never crossed her mind that he would steal drugs. Until he finally admitted the truth to her, she thought he had been genuinely trying to quit. You're right, she should've noticed the withdrawal symptoms (or lack thereof earlier). Well, at least he's finally trying to do the right thing, and Starr helping him through it should bring them back together again.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	That would be the same as saying he should never go into anyone's house again though.People have pills in their medicine cabinet. Hospitals are supposed to be safe...the pills are supposed to be in their pharmacy with someone watching over them at all times. The previews where he is going through withdrawls looks really realistic and I am hoping it plays out as good as it looks.

(Yea, last time I checked I was human)|`|414268ce90f8fa01e1dca06185c8e811aa	cuz the second you take the setting away some freak job spends every waking moment of his freak life sending letters to your company requesting that ridiculous setting!|`|53e99a58585bbb09d9dfaeb5794e1396aa	its for the people who are mean to their pets assuming thy are actually mean enough to give their pets burnt toast. <br>  its so pets dont die unnecessarily. do u have a pet?|`|71f975eb68da766524c315d73d073a91aa	good question.<br>  ...although i peeked at someone else's answer who said you STOLE IT!|`|7e67d715a4b54585a0d250e1a9b1cd31aa	it's for bagels. they have more mass and require more time to toast///|`|AA11109699	Im sure that the person who made the thing thought it was funny to have since while you were not looking somehow it mysterisly got turned all the way up and burned it.  Yeah someone thought it was funny.  just like the person who invented the metal slide on a hot summer day, ??? DUH people!!!

d335cae0f2dc8055006497e3594d3a25aa	Yes.  People who aren't helping, are hurting.  They are taking up space and precious oxygen.  They end up taking up jobs that could be used by a smarter, more motivated person who could use that job to show his true potential.|`|3cec8c1cb1a71b14074eceb4c5f4d3f4aa	Not necessarily, not everytime, things changes, nothing's constant, nothing's for ever.|`|4800cf32319bd37a2f66e983ce3cd041aa	i think some people are a waste of space and therefore are using up my oxygen:)|`|a11bab522676e731a3c1011d633f6bbcaa	Usually if a person is completely useless, then they are being harmful in one form or another.|`|2ba4f4e34a0857e9e8d0fa04a955a7c2aa	If it is a placebo and you think you are getting the real medication and you do not get better then I would say yes...cause you are under the assumption you are taking something that will make you better.

jrUGUNaeaa	Yes I totally agree! A lot of questions asked on here I've seen on other websites many other times and I'm thinking "just look it up on google!" <br>  <br>  On the other hand, some questions are just for advice or something you wouldn't be able to find on google, or maybe take hours of research. So I could see where they're coming from.<br>  <br>  But other questions there are really no point to ask on here!|`|E0U2yII3aa	Yes! Specially those who make their homeworks with multiple choices. However, people still want to use Yahoo! Answers for a couple of reasons:<br>  <br>  1. There's a sense of personalization when you get real people to answer your questions. <br>  2. You may get your answers in the easiest and most understandable form possible. Why? There's always someone there wanting to share their knowledge, help or just want to get points. That's an advantage for very hard to understand principles and theories.<br>  3. Some people merely want to express themselves or their ideas, opinions and take people's take on it whether it be trolling or sincere.<br>  4. Someone doesn't have the will to look over a thousand offered links to a question but rather have someone choose it for them.<br>  <br>  Well, I still hate the no-brainers and  wish them out of Yahoo! Answers! But there is a fun part. Some respondents are outrageously funny that when they tease or annoy the no-brainers they spurt out humorous jokes and the like. I always enjoy reading those parts.|`|ZkmFoiobaa	yes, thats how i answer alot of the questions, then i think could they have not just done that and saved time or are they just damn lazy and i am a mug. ha ha ha|`|TGV834WJaa	totally agree!|`|5NsgLFPRaa	Yeah true<br>  <br>  but maybe they like getting other opinions quick|`|LznGt9MWaa	yea,|`|nqkXE1cUaa	I know!<br>  I always get answers from searching googles.<br>  The only reason I come on here is for polls.|`|MHzNI9Yvaa	haha.. yup yup. of course.|`|w0M3GY6Yaa	Ha Ha Ha !!!<br>  <br>  I *totally* agree with u here!<br>  <br>  Seriously, it probably takes less time to google it up than to ask, cuz here we have got to go through all the procedure of asking a question [no offense Y!A ;) ], while on the other hand, u just enter the subject on the google toolbar and *swoosh*... u get ur results almost immediately. Isn't it better to just get immediate results rather than to wait for people to answer, and believe me, the majority of the answers do not answer the question directly!!! <br>  <br>  In many cases, the answerers just copy n paste directly from wiki; if that is all that the questioner requires, then why doesnt he/she go to wiki directly?!?<br>  <br>  So, once again, I totally agree with u. You surely have a point and u got my vote!!|`|e1af82b05dba630a2810a8c6c920f193aa	Yes, or just nip onto youtube and find things out.<br>  Definitely, but it gets people easy points, and some people may not be computer literate? unlikely but possible!|`|xYLnLCVVaa	sometimes, but i will answer then anyways..people just like coming on here, and i guess it is better for some people to get an answer from an actual person.|`|XdYOoFb5aa	<.< yea but my questions are usually on polls and surverys.  Why would i google people's eye colors and other crap.|`|4fc1ef56936b85ef7b0ddfafd1d38e4caa	Not really since what they need sometimes is the personal touch.|`|hd7J2aoNaa	yes!<br>  [Pro-Sarcasm?]|`|K4bJgTF4aa	definitely|`|2bb429dcb4ece13532be93a521642e0eaa	(sigh*) yep|`|vTvNT3mcaa	ya probably but thats why i stay in polls because they are just funny and WIERD questions|`|5M0yL2G9aa	yes....but apparently it is better to ask on yahoo answers|`|CYhOr4s7aa	but where is the fun in that,  and the thumbs downs and all that good stuff|`|KS4a4QmLaa	yes a lot of ppl could do that|`|tAN2R0NYaa	heck yea!|`|H9h1SB5eaa	yes i agree, sometimes i say to myself that the person should have google his/her question before asking on Y!A|`|t1wH1uRZaa	i kow but sometime its just funny to see what ppl's opinions are!|`|nUgKC0UCaa	yes. but if you googled it, we'd all be horribly bored.|`|xDSJWEYsaa	agreed|`|ubUoXSbBaa	yes|`|TGFc2Z6Caa	I totally agree with you. Sometimes the answers you get on here art just totally wrong, to boot.|`|QaT680QHaa	Yeah but I like getting "REAL answers from REAL people"<br>  lol|`|3qLIRorjaa	Serious questions, yes.|`|lkNJNnlSaa	Yeah i agree.<br>  <br>  <br>  In the 5-10 mins to get a decent answer, they could have looked it up 5 times over and found it themselves|`|50UbJp14aa	Yep, they sure would, but you this site when you can.|`|de9f7acd14f689e6d025e242e532c54daa	yes!!! especially in the lyrics section.  its like...wow...why dont you type the lyrics into google?? thats how people answer the question! some people just dont realize this i guess.  oh well, more free points for us.<br>  =)

I'm talking about loving someone who turns out to abuse substances. Having done so myself a very long time ago, my thinking has changed from blaming a person to blaming a disease that has affected a person I have loved. I know the topic is debatable, but I'm not answering this question this way to debate. Maybe another way to answer is to say that someone was used to tear my heart out. Hopefully by realizing what happened in the past and what is happening in the present, I can ensure a more healthy future where relationships are concerned.|`|AA11286278	You should read the book Love in the time of Cholera by Gabriel Garcia-Marquez.

It was so funny because I don't think he realized who I was at first.

arjB50zBaa	Anna...Mt thoughts exactly!!<br>  First I happen to like Billy (and it has nothing to do with him being sexy as hell). <br>  Cane thinks he is god, I just cant stand him anymore. I dont even think he is Jills son still but hey that dna test that Chloe took months ago must mean something. So I guess that wishful thinking that he isnt Jill's son,lol.<br>  Its no wonder why Billy is who he is with the way Jill treats him. Hell I would have a complex of some sort too.<br>  I think Billy would woop Cane's butt with one arm tied to his leg and blindfolded....I wanna see it happen. <br>  I'll be watching to see if you show up and beat Jill down because I know she is not about to change, but hey if you cant find your way or make it no worries because I think once Mrs.C gets back Jill will be knocked down a peg or 2 when she finds out she is not a Chancelor after all.....Or at least I hope so...Me and my wishful thinking.|`|r7sgshwKaa	Personally I think Billy could take Cane. Geez they act like the two brothers in the Bible, (Cane and Abel). You know Cane would now be Billy because Cane killed Abel.  I wish that he hadn't messed things up with Lilly because I think he really was having feelings for her.  Oh what a tangled web we weave......|`|O0b9Kiosaa	What's everyone talking about?  Cane would beat Billy down under the ground.  Have you forgot where he's from:  Aussie baby!  Boxing kangaroos, etc...  Billy, like Jack can't get down throwing hands.  However, Cane should step aside, get his ring back and move on.  Someone needs to kick Jill's butt.|`|ubkt5RQiaa	I liked Cane, until the last few episodes where he has been acting needy and desperate.  The baby isn't his!  It sucks, but he needs to suck it up and get back with Lily and just leave Chloe to Billy because they deserve each other anyway!|`|AA11334527	Yes Cane is annoying me with his self righteousness. I want to see Billy come out on top, Cane doesn't need to be involved in Chloe and Billy's baby's life.|`|Kx3I4RC7aa	I agree, I use to like Cane at the beginning but not any more all he douse is winne over every little thing now and go to there mom, its really annoying.|`|EPPb5pRBaa	Yeah, i would love to see Billy kicks Cane's butt. I am so sick of Cane attitude.|`|cce7d68825e6be23ab1dbad4e0df262faa	I'm there with you I'll help you kick Jill's butt!|`|uUzbqGh5aa	Well since Billy slept with Sharon, l have no respect for him anymore and l think both Jack and Cane should kick him to high heavens!|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I would!  I know that he has been so bad lately, but somehow he makes me still like him.  He has not had an easy time of it, growing up the way he did.  And Cane has had such a holier-than-thou attitude lately.  I really disliked the way he blasted Lily the other day.  <br>  <br>  Jill is a great one to be putting her own son down isn't she, after all the stuff she has pulled??  haha.|`|fcPiQDwEaa	No, l'd like everyone who now knows that Billy was a sucker and didn't want to claim responsibility for his child, all the while sitting in the background and content to let Cane do his "fatherly duties" with Chloe and the baby so he could try to trap Lily and when all else fails, he sleeps with his brother Jack's wife! Billy needs a good @ss whopping if you ask me!|`|75zggy81aa	I'm sick of seeing them fight personally- BUT Cane is WAY out of line on this one- why wont he just deal with his sadness and leave them alone? I hope he has ruined his chance with Lily since he had no intention of leaving Chloe when he still thought the baby was his in the hospital. Everyone thinks him and Lily are so "perfect" and "moral" I want to see another side. And Jill is one of the most annoying characters on the show! I can't wait for everyone to find out she isn't Kay's real daughter so she cant quit acting holyier than God!!!|`|lGdzb8aqaa	I want Billy to beat the crap out of Cane, I am so sick of Cane and I hope Lilly is pregnant by Billy too (maybe to miscarry later on) keep the drama going.Tiana Billy asked Chloe several times if the baby was his, she told him no, I feel his mistake was not telling Cane he knew Chloe before.Cane is so stupid.|`|FwU6GL4Laa	I agree with you, I'm so sick of Cane walking around like he's so tough I wish he would get Billy at the wrong time for once and Billy knocks him out cold. Jill is pathetic maby Billy and Chloe will keep the baby away from her and she will see what it feels like to be out numbered.

AA10087895	Yes, the Bit.  The Bit is actually part of a complete collection of measurement units which have been around for centuries.<br>  <br>  A Bit is just slightly more than the next lowest measurement which is the Little Bit.  Below that you have a minuscule measurement of a Wee Bit.  Some people still use the A Lot O Bit measurement, but that was outlawed in 1523 and just replace with A Lot, as it was being confused with the latest craze discovered by the Conquistadors (the Bit-O-Honey).<br>  <br>  As far as translation goes, I referenced the Old Farmers Almanac to see if I could get a pinpoint conversion and found one.  I was unable to understand it though because a bit actually is measured on the rubber band scale and the exact translated measurement formula is something like Truth = Stretch - Theoretical Truth + Stretch / Realistic Truth * Stretch (to the third power).<br>  |`|a358acbf6adf701866cfcd08356591daaa	well... at first I thought it was a serious question... then i read it all and realised what you mean by bit, but googled it all the same... on a site similar to this...there was no answer yet but read below what Wikipedia says... <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit</a> <br>  A bit is a binary digit, taking a value of either 0 or 1. Binary digits are a basic unit of information storage and communication in digital computing and digital information theory. Information theory also often uses the natural digit, called either a nit or a nat. Quantum computing also uses qubits, a single piece of information with a probability of being true.<br>  <br>  And we think Wikipedia was a good ref....<br>  <br>  |`|K4Y76H3qaa	Well, Speed LIMIT is the LIMIT...anything above that is a bit per mile.  You are either drunk or a little bit drunk...same as a lie or a little lie.  There is no tolerance for those factors.<br>  Girls never get tickets anyway...they just put on a smile to the officer and get away free.  Us, ugly guys have to take the ticket like a man.|`|1kd33vOaaa	I believe it to be about one tenth the length of a piece of string.  Get the idea?  And no.  I am not trying to be funny.  Hope your girlfriend pays a little more attention to her speedo'.  Have a nice day and God bless.|`|luwBPdE8aa	A bit is not a specific unit; it means "a small amount."|`|DooqYRfAaa	Well, let me first start by saying yes, everyone knows there is a speed limit posted but the distance between speed limit posts can be quite a distance and one can potentially slow down or go faster between point A and point C, anywhere in between is AB or BC, which is a bit more than A or a bit more or less than C.  A is another word for almost, B for barely and C for cruizin'.  So a "bit" over is where Cruzin' would be otherwise it would have to be Almost Cruzin' or Barely Cruzin'.  Consider me at C-Cruzin.

His father sees him killing the honeybee and angrily says, "No honey for you for one month!"<br>  <br>  Later that afternoon, Johnny's dad catches him tearing the wings off a butterfly. "That's it! No butter for you for one month!" says his dad.<br>  <br>  Later that evening as Johnny's mother cooks dinner, a cockroach run across the kitchen floor. She jumps and stomps on it, and then looks up to find Little Johnny and her husband watching her.<br>  <br>  Little Johnny looks at his father and says, "Are you going to tell her, Dad, or do you want me to?"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and another one...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  A man left from work one Friday afternoon. But, being payday, instead of going home, he stayed out the entire weekend partying with the boys and spending his entire paycheck. <br>  <br>  When He finally appeared at home, Sunday Night, he was confronted by a very angry wife and was barraged for nearly two hours with a tirade befitting his actions. <br>  <br>  Finally his wife stopped the nagging and simply said to him, "How would you like it if you didn't see me for two or three days?" <br>  <br>  To which he replied. "That would be fine with me." <br>  <br>  Monday went by and he didn't see his wife. Tuesday and Wednesday came and went with the same results. <br>  <br>  Come Thursday, the swelling went down just enough where he could see her a little out of the corner of his left eye.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and another one...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  In case you needed further proof that the human race is doomed to stupidity, here are some actual label instructions on consumer goods:<br>  <br>  On a Sears hairdryer -- Do not use while sleeping.<br>  (Shoot, and that's the only time I have to work on my hair.)<br>  <br>  On a bag of Fritos -- You could be a winner!

Goodbye Grampa."<br>  <br>  Well, the father thought it was strange, but he soon forgot about it. The next day, the Grandfather died. <br>  <br>  About a month or two later the father heard his son saying his prayers again "God bless Mommy and Daddy. Goodbye Granny."<br>  <br>  The next day the grandmother died. Well, the father was getting more than a little worried about the whole situation.<br>  <br>  Two weeks later, the father once again overheard his sons prayers. "God Bless Mommy. Good bye Daddy."<br>  <br>  This alone nearly gave the father a heart attack. He didn't say anything but he got up early to go to work, so that he would miss the traffic. He stayed all through lunch and dinner. Finally after midnight he went home. He was still alive! <br>  <br>  When he got home he saw his wife at the kitchen sobbing and crying her heart out. He asked his wife, "What's wrong, honey?"<br>  <br>  His wife replies, "Well, our mailman just died on our doorstep this morning!"<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  lol i hope u liked!<br>  have a nice day!|`|s1BzuVckaa	For some time many of us have wondered just who is Jack Schitt? We find ourselves at a loss when someone says, 'You don't know Jack Schitt!' Well, thanks to my genealogy efforts, you can now respond in an intellectual way.<br>  <br>  Jack Schitt is the only son of Awe Schitt. Awe Schitt, the fertilizer magnate, married O. Schitt, the owner of Needeep N. Schitt, Inc. They had one son, Jack.<br>  <br>  In turn, Jack Schitt married Noe Schitt. The deeply religious couple produced six children: Holie Schitt, Giva Schitt, Fulla Schitt, Bull Schitt, and the twins Deep Schitt and Dip Schitt.<br>  <br>  Against her parents' objections, Deep Schitt married Dumb Schitt, a high school dropout. After being married 15 years, Jack and Noe Schitt divorced. Noe Schitt later married Ted Sherlock, and because her kids were living with them, she wanted to keep her previous name. She was then known as Noe Schitt Sherlock.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, Dip Schitt married Loda Schitt, and they produced a son with a rather nervous disposition named Chicken Schitt. Two of the other six children, Fulla Schitt and Giva Schitt, were inseparable throughout childhood and subsequently married the Happens brothers in a dual ceremony. The wedding announcement in the newspaper announced the<br>  Schitt-Happens nuptials. The Schitt-Happens children were Dawg, Byrd, and Horse.<br>  <br>  Bull Schitt, the prodigal son, left home to tour the world. He recently returned from Italy with his new Italian bride, Pisa Schitt.<br>  <br>  Now when someone says, 'You don't know Jack Schitt,' you can correct them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  Crock O.

a63c38af1be21d5bd75ee7a55242ef0baa	I guess you never really stop learning new things on the guitar.. Great instrument though and a lot of fun to play. My dad has been playing for a long, long time, and he's played with a lot of bands and musicians and I'm pretty sure he still learns new stuff. I guess to be good at guitar it depends on the person, some people can pick it up quickly and others it takes more time. It does take a lot of practice though. I've been around music and guitars all my life (as I mentioned before, my dad's a pro) and I only started taking it at school this year - I have guitar class everyday and I still spend a lot of time practicing, but it's definitely a lot of fun. If I were you, I'd go ahead and take it up :)|`|2sQMjw9Raa	i could have you playing pearl jam in five minutes, but ive been playing over 5 years and I still dont know the point at which I 'learned' or 'will learn' the guitar. learning is a progressive thing, and there is always something new to learn, especially with guitar.

Noone will ever be fully 'learned' not even stevie vai|`|2QRKFun2aa	Well i play the guitar and i take lessons in my school. i haven't mastered it yet but it only took me a couple of weeks to really understand the notes. when u actually play it. it is really easy & fun.|`|my2Y8PXSaa	ive been playin for ab 2 yrs and after ab a year n a half i was able to play anything i set my mind to       keep playin no matter how bad u think u sound    u get better everytime u play|`|2AU71Nraaa	Basic chords and barre chords you can learn by practicing everyday for days or weeks. Learning shred guitar, or any type of speed playing takes months and years of constant practice.|`|okz1fXf4aa	if youre older it will probal;y take longer unless youve got a real knack for it|`|B0fgIolOaa	im 17  and took me 10 years to be a pro<br>  and i would  practice 8 hours a day|`|OtUozt5raa	Well it depends on how far you want to go. Here is a list of different styles:<br>  Rock: 1 month<br>  Metal: 2-3 months<br>  Lead/Solo: 1-2 months<br>  Special effects: 4-5 months<br>  <br>  That is how long it took me. I teach myself so if you take lessons it will probably be half the time.|`|aTS9NoTNaa	It doesn't take long to pick up the basic skills needed to play chords etc but if you want to 'master' it, that will take years of dedicated practice and lessons. Even those who are very skilled cant really claim to be complete 'masters'. Once you can play decently from lessons, you should make a band if possible as its a great incentive to keep practicing and be creative.

AA12100644	I completely agree with you.  The roads are getting worse all the time - I am fearful to drive now and do so very carefully.  It seems that so many people are unhappy, angry and frustrated - maybe they are on too many drugs to treat depression and anxiety - and they are simply taking it out on everyone around them.

xTioPxaVaa	If your guitar amp has an "effects loop return" or a "power amp in" jack on it, then I would plug the mixer into that.<br>  <br>  Plugging into the normal input is not recommended, as the preamp and tone stack on a guitar amp is not optimal for reproducing full range signals (like what you're wanting to amplify).<br>  <br>  To go stereo, you would need a second power amp/guitar amp.  No way around that.<br>  <br>  Power amps are, as you say "pricey", but they're built to have a wide frequency response, and usually have a lot more power output than a guitar amp.  A 100W guitar amp is pretty large, but that's a very small PA amp.<br>  <br>  It's not going to be optimal, but it will make noise for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Greetings from Austin, TX<br>  <br>  Ken

7kOXKx1iaa	***NCIS is one of those shows that just keeps getting better as time goes by. My fav character is Gibbs, without a doubt.  But I truly like every character from Tony to Ziva and Probie/Tim  to Abby and even Duckie, and back when Kate and Jenny were on, because each of the characters bring some neat quirks.  As far as a fav episode, I don't really have just one, but when Kate or when Jenny(Director) were killed  were some good shows.|`|974nkC59aa	I like the relationships between the characters.

Well, i like the way its set and as someone else said- the relationships between the characters.<br>  It just a really amazing tv show- no one could say it isn't- it leaves me hanging on the edge of my seat at the end of every part!<br>  <br>  My favourite character would have to be Abby because she is unique and is really sweet, but i do love Tony- he is hilarious!<br>  <br>  Its hard to choose an episode- there are so many i like but i would have to say 'Requiem' as it was really emotional - when gibbs kept going back to the past seeing kelly his daughter with her friend, it was really upsetting for me to view as well as others!<br>  It was a really good episode and i loved the ending!<br>  I LOVE NCIS!

VLRkJOOuaa	I don't think its biased. Maybe... Masashi Kishimoto just has a bigger picture in mind; he's probably just trying to get the plot moving along in the direction he sees is best (the way he envisioned it).<br>  <br>  <br>  Sure, I thought Hinata's death was sad and totally unfair, but she kind of had it coming. What. Did she think she was actually going to kill Pain?<br>  <br>  I think in her head, she was thinking if she sacrificed herself, she would get Naruto motivated enough to finish this fight once and for all. But that's just my thoughts on the subject. And a part of me believes that she isn't really dead yet, so idk what to think.<br>  <br>  Bottom line is, Hinata's death was unfair, but a little expected. :||`|AbW947tiaa	Hinata's death will be an integral part of the whole story. On Hinata's final hours, Sakura will come and do a medical transplant jutsu to transfer her byakugan eyes to Naruto. Naruto will kill Pein and will eventually fight a powered up Sasuke. It will be Kyuubi Byakugan vs. Ultimate Sharingan.|`|tL5vlITcaa	She didn't die.<br>  <br>  <br>  Though the death of every main character and ending of this ******* series is a preferable outcome.|`|I4BEe27Gaa	I dont think she is dead, or at least I hope not.

Naruto is probably going to end up saving her by sacrificing himself. However, if she did die that fast, that was just a really lazy way of killing her off.|`|VvAZ8Tpaaa	actually Hinata didnt die... she wrapped herself in a chakra layer and saved herself but she's exhausted and ya u never see her kicken some *** but Naruto's 2 inlove wit Sakura 4 her they do go2gether|`|NNxLypgaaa	Personally, I didn't see anything that says without a doubt she is dead. She could be unconscious. I like her for Naruto a lot more than Sakura.<br>  <br>  I agree that her segment was waaaaay too short.|`|gr6kxlPCaa	same here i feel your pain brethrens I also like hinata, and her death was kind of short and disturbing..

HQssYZ8taa	I was at the town square mall with my family. My brother is 18, and me and my mom were in this girly store (thats why he didnt come in, so he waited on a bench outside) and we came out and he was flirting with a woman who was like 26, and she was definatley into him. HAhaaa, i thought it was funny. But my mom didnt really care. So to answer your question, idk|`|dU0jFx4taa	well when I was in portugal some guys drove past in a car and whistled at me, lol my mum was the one who noticed I was just like "huh?" :P|`|oJSpdFpaaa	Hahaha,no.<br>  but that would be a funny sight.<br>  [x|`|hFVPEkWjaa	My god it's really embarrassing my father goes back and talk to them.|`|7RFxH5daaa	Yeah, I have. I was at Walmart with my mom and step-dad and some random guy came up to me and just randomly started talking to me. He's all "How you doing?" ... I just looked away and kept walking.|`|Uv6fADcaaa	It happens nearly every time my pop and I have "father-daughter" time,lol. I used to be really embarrassed, but now I usually blow the guys off or tell them I'm with my dad.<br>  <br>  I found what is worse though! I will go out with my dad (mall,movies,dinner, etc..) and HE will get hit on, and alot of the time it will be some chick my age... <br>  <br>      I've told a couple off (NO! He will not be your next sugar daddy! Now get yourself and your banana republic clad **** go find your girlfriends and gossip about the OC... shoo!) lol.<br>  <br>  It really is frustrating when you are sitting right there, It is disturbing! Why flirt with a guy 30yrs your senior, in front of his daughter?!|`|ROWSzTknaa	I won't be seen with them. Are you trying to commit social suicide? Yeah, everyone flirts with me and sure I'd flirt back if he meets my criteria. If my parents got pissed I'd glare at them and tell them to go in the car.|`|gLJBnqYmaa	Haha my guy friends will do that on purpose as a joke.<br>  <br>  Gets a little annoying but thankfully I don't go to the mall with my mom too much.|`|st2zmU88aa	ugh yeah i hate that..no i didn't like the person
RNpaBwxzaa	The person above me is somewhat misinformed. There are nine issues of comics based on the X-Men Evolution tv series, but from what I understand, they were not highly popular, and are thus somewhat rare. The only good place for reading comics online is Marvel.com, but their selection is quite limited, and I very seriously doubt it includes the X-Men Evolution series. Your best bet (perhaps only bet) for reading those particular comics would be to search the internet for comic book collectors who own issues from that series.<br>  Good luck! :)|`|8ad6fQiNaa	You can't read X-men evolution, it's a cartoon show, not one of the comics. You can download it at I-tunes, although not for free. You can also try various torrent sites (I prefer piratebay).

It's not like any other manga, it's just so moving and beautiful. Although it might be just because I relate so much to the main character, I've bought the entire collection in japanese, even though I can't read any of it yet! Incredible, unique manga.<br>  <br>  Another popular and unique manga is Yotsubato!, which is incredibly funny, and has really good characters. It's meant for the younger generation, but that is why I mainly picked it up in Japanese. It has furigana, which means you don't have to remeber the 2000 kanji, you just need to know the japanese alphabet. But it's also great in English, so if you want a laugh, go for it :D|`|d5ce78972fc202ca454766d62ded4077aa	shugo chara,sailor moon,choco to mint to(choco n mint),doughnut in the candy can<manga>,yearning moon<manga>,to walk with you,miss you, n hold you(by mito orihara)<manga>,penguin prince,epotaransu mai,imadoki,alice 19th,Let's shine...(forget the name,but it's about acting world),etc...(I read too much,so i forget,but there is a good one about man in the wheel chair n a shy girl)|`|HqyFyF8haa	======= Boku wa Kisu de Uso wo Tsuku ========<br>  <br>  It's so sweet and cute<br>  <br>  ======= Hibiki's Magic ===========<br>  <br>  One of my all time favorites.<br>  <br>  ======= Pixie Pop ===============<br>  <br>  A cute funny romance manga<br>  <br>  ====== Magical x Miracle ==========<br>  <br>  Has really nice art and is beautiful|`|2DKRF3qoaa	Naruto and thats it.|`|5mkyry7Yaa	I like Loveless (it's shonen-ai)<br>  Hellsing<br>  Code Geass<br>  Death Note <br>  High school Debut : )

kTxeGj1aaa	Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party , popularly known as the Nazi Party. A decorated veteran of World War I, Hitler joined the Nazi Party in 1920 and became its leader in 1921. Following his imprisonment after a failed coup in 1923, he gained support by promoting nationalism, antisemitism and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and propaganda. During the final days of the war in 1945, Hitler married his long-time mistress Eva Braun. Less than 40 hours later, the two committed suicide<br>  <br>  Have a nice day! :)|`|G0TkeRbEaa	brutal|`|AsVgeUl6aa	TOOK REVENGE,CRUEL,IMPASSIONATE<br>  <br>  {read his biography}|`|aLCjCuVAaa	adolph hitler was very racist! he went to jail in his twenties and wrote a book about everything he planned on doing.

GnYw9Pvwaa	Not anime enough.<br>  <br>  That's like cosplaying as gandalf.|`|BZJGNFymaa	That will be an awesome costume.  Anime conventions aren't just about anime - they are a Japanese (and often Chinese, Korean, etc.) culture fest of sorts, just on the nerdier end of the spectrum. :]  Besides, plenty of people cosplay from non-anime fandoms - J-Rock and American video games are common, too.  Kill Bill will not be out of place at all.<br>  <br>  Remember to have fun with it, and rock your costume!
POqwp3Fiaa	Chuck Norris once visited the Virgin Islands. They are now The Islands. <br>  Some kids piss their name in the snow. Chuck Norris can piss his name into concrete. <br>  Leading hand sanitizers claim they can kill 99.9 percent of germs. Chuck Norris can kill 100 percent of whatever the **** he wants. <br>  Chuck Norris counted to infinity - twice.<br>  Chuck Norris' tears cure cancer. Too bad he has never cried. <br>  Chuck Norris' calendar goes straight from March 31st to April 2nd; no one fools Chuck Norris. <br>  Chuck Norris does not sleep. He waits. <br>  Once, while having sex in a tractor-trailer, part of Chuck Norris' sperm escaped and got into the engine. We now know this truck as Optimus Prime. <br>  Chuck Norris can speak braille.<br>  Chuck Norris doesn't cheat death. He wins fair and square.  <br>  Chuck Norris puts the "laughter" in "manslaughter".  <br>  Chuck Norris once won a game of Connect Four in 3 moves.  <br>  Chuck Norris owns the greatest Poker Face of all-time. It helped him win the 1983 World Series of Poker despite him holding just a Joker, a Get out of Jail Free Monopoly card, a 2 of clubs, 7 of spades and a green #4 card from the game Uno. <br>  Chuck Norris can do a wheelie on a unicycle.|`|7fallgzXaa	chuck norris can swallow a rubix cube and sh*t it out solved|`|ePS5ggiTaa	his chin|`|c3svN3Evaa	His famous round house kick, what else!|`|FsFp4f1Yaa	Chuck Norris can divide by zero.|`|kZ9TTWZ9aa	idk???|`|JQZzI49Paa	The fact that he can swim though land
AA11949266	it's basically all re-runs but they add a special twist to it to make you watch them.<br>  Whenever a degrassi btw episode is on, "fun facts" about filming, the cast, and some other random stuff pops up on the screen. <br>  It's sort of interesting to find out more about the show, but the pop ups get annoying quite a while and makes you wish that a new episode was on instead.

m2vBJaHKaa	no one knows for sure yet ;)|`|sr7jX2wYaa	I understand you are  concerned  because they are  celebrities, but  what  about  the  woman  who's name you don't know  that lives 2 doors down who's  husband just beat her so bad she  had  to be hospitalized  for 2 days  , because  he didn't like  his  supper? Do you have a problem  with that?*|`|Ehox3Io2aa	Toni: The bruises tell it all! Chris Brown is a prissy little ******. Everybody knows that men are stronger than women, so even if Rihanna did hit him first, that still didn't give him the right to hit her back. In my opinion I think Chris should rot in hell. Oooo child if that was me, I would've broken every single one of his teeth. <br>  <br>  Angela: Lmao, Toni! :D Um..you know I was surprized when I first heard about this. I mean I never expected Chris to snap at Rihanna the way he did. Like if you see them in pictures, they look so happy and stuff. Its just really sad that it amounted to that. But, then again I don't know what really went down that night, so I'm not really quick to judge. The picture of Rihanna all beaten up was just....WOW. And I do feel sorry for Rihanna for going through all that. I understand couples have these problems, where they just end up arguring and stuff but it should never lead up to violence. Instead of hitting, they could have just worked it out 'cause violence is never an answer :)<br>  <br>  Giselle: Chris is hot ;)<br>  <br>  Angela and Toni: *look at Giselle weirdly* <br>  <br>  Giselle: What? He could hit me, I'd be Tina Turner!<br>  <br>  Angela and Toni: *laugh* <br>  <br>  Giselle: Ok, I'm totally playing there. Chris should have never hit Rihanna and Rihanna should never hit him because men can't control themselves. I mean what'd she expect, that if she **** him, he wasn't gonna fight back? They should just break up and NEVER get back together 'cause that's just dysfunctional, and Chris needs to GROW SOME BALLS! If he can't take a single slap and he's still trying to get back together with her. Just be a man and accept that its over! :D<br>  <br>  Angela: Lmao, I hear that, Giselle! ;D|`|DjJwKc9Caa	a man should never hit a woman, that's just my opinion. personally i think chris brown is the biggest douchebag alive. chris is an ungrateful son of a *****, rihanna is a gorgeous girl. i'd kill to have her as a girlfriend. he didn't know what he had til he lost it|`|PmpbkocAaa	who cares anymore...everybody know they getting back together...plus his court date been postpone!!!|`|WTjgVrrsaa	who cares about it|`|MediTozcaa	I think it's really pathetic that just because he is "hot" and has a good voice that people are saying that he shouldn't get in trouble.

G05rllkBaa	Why is everyone hating on Biggie and Pac lately, fair enough if you don't think they are the best but you can't deny they were great rappers even if not the greatest in everyones book. Them being dead isn't there fault I don't think they are overrated they are just over talked about so now everyone is sick of hearing about them, so they are saying they hate them.<br>  <br>  No Biggie wasn't good he was great. He put out two solid albums helped put New York back on the map.|`|CDnmuX1Jaa	He's my second favorite rapper :|<br>  <br>  Biggie is dope.<br>  <br>  I dont see how some people say Biggie is overrated<br>  <br>  O well|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	He's better than a lot, but I'd never rate him above Ghostface or a legend like Rakim.|`|qvycijbOaa	Biggie Smaaaaaaaaaaals, the Rap genius.|`|4hiMgHMCaa	Biggie smalls is da illest|`|lkPYYLiKaa	he was alright.  i think hes overrated.  same with 2pac|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	he more then good.|`|9wUrbqT3aa	Yes he was great and is not overated...<br>  <br>  Look at his word play, metaphors, & story telling abilities.  His whole style was quite remarkable.<br>  <br>  Word play example: Song "One more chance"<br>  "She's sick of that song on how it's so long <br>  Thought he worked his until I handled my biz <br>  There I is; Major Payne like Damon Wayans <br>  Low Down Dirty even like his brother Keenan <br>  Schemin, don't leave ya girl round me" <br>  <br>  sick metaphor: Song "Whats Beef"<br>  "Whats beef, Beef is when u need 2 gats to go to sleep<br>  Beef is when yo moms aint safe in da Streets,<br>  Beef is when I See You<br>  Guaranteed to be an I.C.U"|`|oMYGtqubaa	Biggie was a great rapper... great lyricist...  (And I was NOT a big fan)...   BUT, I did recognize that he was lyrically gifted.<br>  <br>  At the time of his death he was on top... so, his legacy was overblown a little (Puffy also had something to do with hyping that up)....<br>  <br>  So, I DON'T believe he's THE greatest of all time as some folks believe...   <br>  <br>  I STILL maintain that RAKIM  holds that title.<br>  <br>  <br>  But, Biggie does deserve to be named AMONG the best who ever did it.|`|I7OZ4glFaa	everybody said he was good i never heard of him but he was supposely the rapper of the century but i think 2pac was better!!|`|mqjj1O3Saa	Heyy,<br>  <br>  dont jsut start listening to himm<br>  cause of that movie that came out!<br>  haha<br>  <br>  <br>  hmm i think he makes lovely music...<br>  and yess i listened to him before the moviee.!|`|dm9evixvaa	i'd put him in my top 15 of all time, but he didn't have longevity (not his fault though) and there are simply better lyricists then him, he was definitely good though.|`|yoVF60ORaa	no, he's dead so he's not good at rapping any more, but he was one of the greatest of all time|`|AA11706809	When it came to rapping, he was the truth.|`|fMHzndjlaa	IMO Biggie was an average rapper and the same with Tupac. Everyone likes them because they were popular, not because of talent. It's also because of the movie, people are reminded of him and go back to listening to him.|`|u7jpAPLDaa	in my opinion he was good, but overrated|`|2HVKaOqdaa	Biggie aint ****, Pac is the GOAT.|`|NRTXMd9paa	TUPAC ALL DAY ERR DAYYY.<br>  he was aiight but tupac was the god of rap.|`|cqSap1YMaa	.........I DNT LYKE  HIM NOR TUPAC....|`|40c3e14042fb370afdfe3a02b5b140ebaa	yep

39OVFs5Raa	The fact that you have to point to the object rather than mentally think of it means that the so called witness is the accomplice!  Check him/her out the make very unassuming signs...like scratching ones cheek, coughing, sneezing, touching a ring etc.  Make the 'witness' leave the room before the mind reader enters...s/he will be stumped!!!.|`|ZdIaVkIcaa	The guy that stays in the room is in on it, when he touches the center object he will touch it in a way that lets the "mind reader" know where the object you picked is, if he touches the center object in the center then that is the object you picked, the rest he will touch the center object on the edge closest to what you picked.|`|2k8TEiRtaa	There is a card trick you can do.

Eros is going to be awesome|`|F91oWeh1aa	Because they don't interest the mainstream music listeners. Nu-metal isn't as popular as it used to be.|`|M7E1uIsKaa	I actually love Deftones!

AA12150751	Yeah...sure... Andrews initials a contemporary story about David Ponder--who is about give up faith and hope in life. My life is a hard one too and I'm just a little girl who just graduated last year from college. To be honest,I cry a lot and is easily to be scared.Being a Junior High teacher,I am defeated at my career feeling that I'm wasting my life.But the whole family need the encouragement and  happiness I provide as well as the money I earn.I used to feel as hopeless as Ponder and have to fight back tears several times.<br>  However,this book showed up and you know,a book like that usually helps a person like me a lot...From the story I know   <br>  how courage, resilience, passion, and optimism could help one achieve greatness in the face of barriers that seemingly impossible to overcome,which enables me to be strong and carry on.<br>  How about your life? Perhaps there are also hardships in your life,aren't there? Have you ever been frustrated with your life,romance...Have you ever thought of given it up and quit?what would happen if you chose a different path? <br>  Well,my friend,I hope you like this answer and <br>  I wish you a wonderful life!

All these new ones are for the money, not for the love. Explore those that can actually freestyle for 3 hours straight with no glitches such as aesop rock, illogic, blueprint.

It is the classic good versus evil epic struggle. The scene that summed it up best is when the emperor asked Anakin if he was ruled by his own self interests, and Anakin said that the sith were ruled by selfishness, and the Jedi only live to help others. That is the core values of good and evil.|`|0af7b5b37f0c0de39ce2dc03cc6cd11caa	it really depends on the movie but in some movies the line betwene good and evil is very hazy(not black or white just shades of gray)<br>  this is a direct reflection of post-modernisim in socity this can be seen in "V for vendetta" where as good and evil can also be seen as two compleatly oposits where good MUST destroy evil such as in "Lord of the Rings" this is a very old form of good vs. evil but it works.
AA10498460	from how i looked at it everything that happened was real and she didnt kill her friends but when she realized that her husband had an affair w/ the asian chick she left her in the cave instead of bringing her along to find an exit...i think it was an alright movie|`|021c2795335e98dc1924c249bfbe59c4aa	I thought the U.S. ending was great, in fact the best thing about the movie! If she didn't make it out alive I would have hated the whole flick! But it left you wondering, of course, how did the other woman get there before her. It was meant to be ambiguous. You can imaging it anyway you like! The U.K. ending I believe was totally negative.

It took Burke 19 years to get offered Chief. Itf that starts when he went to college that makes him 41. If it starts when he was an intern then that makes him 47. He is sleeeping with a 28 year old. Just thought I should throw that in their for you.<br>  <br>  I also thought I should throw in the bit about Izzie, George and Callie, the triangle. At Thanksgiving dinner I had this argument with a young woman about the shower scene, the one in the first season where  Izzie keeps walking in on George when he is in the bathroom. I believe the episode was named boundaries. We were discussing the ethics of such a situation. At any rate, in last night's show as Izzie is talking with George's parents you get the idea that they think he should be sleeping with Izzie. I do too. But, I forgot about the boundaries episode when I saw the episode this year with Callie walking out of the shower and then dropping George's towel. It makes more sense now. Of course you have to recognize that Izzie and George act like a married couple. They had their first argument in this episode and still at the end she takes his spaghetti as they sit close to each other on the couch. And as for my argument, I loved the fact that George's parents where having problems with the whole living together thing. I remember when "Three's Company" was on and this type of relationship was problematic at best.<br>  <br>  Going forward, I see Christina having to move in with Meredith. I see that cutting into Derek's sex life so he will get on Preston's case.  I see Alex sleeping with Addison very soon. Addison is an older model of Meredith and when she has a few they are going to have sex. That will of course make Alex Mark's whipping boy. <br>  Hauk will have to join the cast now. She could sleep with George. There is no explaining how he got her to take the surgery on such short notice. And it shouldn't be long before the monster arises and Izzie has sex with Mark or if my suspicians are correct Burke. I see them consoling each other. I wouldn't be surprised if Mc Hotty comes back and starts up with Mc Steamy making Mc Dreamy Mc Tense.<br>  <br>  Oh yea, the 8.7 million is now important because it can go to the cardiac care unit and get Burke back his job.|`|8b11d1f4f8b01f3e7a096ea507015094aa	by far its my favorite show to watch, there was so much drama last night with burke and all his tramas's, one second I felt sorry for him, the next thought what a self centered guy, and to end of  the show with him closing the door on her, was maddening, and george took on a whole new level last night too.Was a very good show as always

9e2d77c79dde9fb4673c53814a816c4aaa	I think it is an AWESOME movie. <br>  <br>  Let me be clear. I am NOT and was not a Transformers fan. Didn't grow up with it - was too old into that sort of things. BUT..... as much as I enjoy my movies and don't try to be overly critical of them - I DO expect a movie to deliver some entertainment value.<br>  <br>  I can honestly say that the Transformers movie is really really really good. Acting is certainly not as good as Pirates 3 (then again, it is hard to compete with Depp, Bloom and Rush) but this is a well mae movie. The special effects is extremely well done and the story flows and I can't pick any faults with it.<br>  <br>  For those people who are waiting to see it - GO! SEE! ENJOY!|`|KnrPNgFKaa	Hate it!  only went with my 12 year old son.|`|c3GlfHsnaa	A+  Great Action, Great Story, Great Potential to outgross Star Wars.  If you have not seen it yet, please go see it.  Dont believe these people who know nothing about the storyline or the past of Transformers.  They are all full of it.  This movie is EXCELLENT.  I have seen it and I will go see it 12 more times before it leaves theaters.  Its more than worth the money and more than meets the eye!

Go for it!|`|JgCGpQaxaa	Solare doesn't mean anyting in Japanese, so it wouldn't really work too well.  You should just stick with an English title, because after all, you are writing this in English, right?  Immitating Japanese art is wonderful, but don't invent words because they seem Japanese to you.  People who actually know Japanese language and culture would never be able to take you seriously.<br>  <br>  If you are going to use Solare as the title, it better have something to do with the story (ie a powerful item is named Solare, or the type of magic used is called Solare, or it takes place in a location named Solare).  If that's the case, it is a wonderful title.  It sounds smooth, and looks exotic- just don't label it as being "Japanese."

If he claims to be that best friend of yours, he'll listen, and you should too. Listen with your heart, not your ears. Also, listen with the intent to understand, not necessarily reply. Good luck.

hP2nzb2haa	A glow in the dark party is pretty simple. You will need to buy some black lights from your local dollar store, as many as possible is recommended. Call the stores first; most are out, usually available around Halloween season. (I do know Walgreen have them right now and usually always do. Go to your local Walgreen store or check the website to see which Walgreen store have blacklight in your area, type: blacklight... don't get the cheap kinds it doesn't work as great, fluorescents are the best.) Replace all regular light bulbs with the black lights for the party in four corners wall. The lights will have better reflex. Buy glow sticks - necklaces, bracelets, etc. (Michael's Craft store have it right now for a dollar which it contain 15 bracelet w/connector pieces) Your party be in the evening can be held in the backyard or inside the house with a big-wide party room, but if you want it during the day, pick up some plain black sheets and drape all windows and doors with the sheets to keep the daylight from entering your party atmosphere.<br>  Along with your black lights, if it is possible to get strobe lights or a disco ball, go for it! Add a very fun impact to your dance floor. <br>  Also, make sure that the balloons, streamers and confetti are all white or lime green so that they will glow in the black lights. White balloons are the best, just put the small green glow stick (snap it on) inside the balloons and tie-it with a string around the wall or up from the ceiling.<br>  Buy some yellow highlight markers and white paper banners to put on your walls. Let guests write on the banners if they'd like. Buy some big star glow in the dark stickers and stick them up on walls and your ceiling. There are tons of creative activities that you can have at your glow in the dark party. Also if you wish, buy some temporary neon hair dye and streak your guests’ hair to glow in the dark! Don't forget to buy some glow in the dark nail polish. Tell friends to do the same, if they want to. Buy some white face paint and have your guests draw designs on each other’s faces! White will glow against the black lights very well. <br>  <br>  For guests, pick up some:<br>  * Glow sticks, and other glow jewelry<br>  * Glow in the dark sunglasses<br>  * White or neon hats for the guys and masks for the girls<br>  <br>  As your guests walk into your party, hand them all their glowing accessories. There are tons of glowing jewelers sold at your local dollar store or party supply store. Make sure that every guest comes to your party wearing as much white as they can! White glow in the dark.<br>  <br>  Food:<br>  Make sure that it is simple and not something that will require a lot of light to prepare. I would recommend to prepare any food before the party begins or order take out. Get some glow in the dark cups and ice cubes or just a white cups/plates/etc. Serve your guests like Lime Soda or Mountain Dew or buy some package of Jell-O package and mix it up with Lime Soda. Serve drinks with glow in the dark straws. Serve food on simply white party plates. Get sherbet ice creams and cupcakes/cake in neon colors. They’re fun.... be creative and fun!<br>  <br>  Get blacklights and ask everyone to wear all white. Their clothing will definitely glow! It is a great idea to have a dance at your glow in the dark party. Mix some techno in with your favorite music. If you can, hire a DJ for the party. Dance the night away and have a glow stick limbo contest, neon hula-hoops, and hot potato with glow in the dark ball, play flashlight tag with glow sticks, and have "the best glow in the dark face paint". Just for fun get some glow in the dark blow up balls (like the beach ball) to throw around the dance floor. (One ball is perfect.) Have a super great time!|`|NnIBtVPRaa	Get personalized candy bar favors or other customized favors.. check out www.kickcreations.com

3L9bRmOqaa	OVA stands for Original Video Animation.  It is a Japanese-originating term for animated films and series which are made specially to be released on home video formats. The large majority are released direct-to-video, without prior showings on TV or in theatres; there may be very rare occasions where, for example, the first part of an OVA series is broadcast for promotional purposes. OVA titles were originally made available on VHS, later becoming more popular on LaserDisc and eventually DVD.|`|2C6xvTagaa	the original version of the anime<br>  <br>  usuallz, i found them to be about 30 minutes long, and old <br>  =P|`|3w0aTZCAaa	OVA or OAV stands for Original Video Animation & Original Animation Video respectively. Basically this means that it's a side story that doesn't always tie in with the origional storyline. These short videos (they range from 1 to 12 episodes) are usually released straight to video. If they gain popularity, they might be aired many moons later.|`|AA11311442	As Saiyuki said, an OVA is for promotional purposes. They are sometimes created after an anime if it is extremely popular. Basically, they are a continuation of the story as seen after the official one is over.<br>  <br>  If that makes sense.

uD1S5dYtaa	Hi, since no one else has answered your question I'm gonna give you info straight out of a very good book.  "It is very difficult to express yourself with confidence.  You are very uncertain and doubtful about your capabilities. However at times you do express yourself as though you were in complete command, but then you suffer disappointment.  Your veiled outlook on life allows you to avoid unpleasantness and ignore personal responsibilities.  In your mind you tend to create the kind of reality you can accept, even tho' it bears little resemblance to the facts as others understand them.  When your attention is focused on art, poetry, music, or drama, you are extremely creative and inspired.  There is a mystical quality to your artistic  expression that sets it apart from others.  You have special gifts but you must have training in order to use them constructively and gain social recognition from them.---There is more but I don't want to take up too much space.  E-mail me for the rest, if you want it.
ClRuPRs7aa	LOL good one! =)  Here's 2 jokes for you:      1.Never before had Sue looked in the box that her husband kept under their bed.     The box had been there for the past 20 years of their marriage but she had never invaded his privacy. One day, while cleaning, she decided to take a look in the box. She didn't figure it was anything he was hiding since she could have looked at it any other time but hadn't.     In the box she found 3 eggs and 10 thousand dollars. This seemed very strange so she went to Fred and asked, "Why are there 3 eggs in a box under our bed?"     He replied, "Well, every time I was unfaithful to you, I put an egg in the box." Sue was surprised and hurt that he had been unfaithful but she consoled herself with the fact that they had been married for over 20 years and he had only been unfaithful 3 times.     "But where did the 10 thousand dollars come from?" she asked.     "Well, every time I got a dozen, I sold it."    2. A woman accompanied her husband to the doctor's office.     After his checkup, the doctor called the wife into his office alone. He said, "Your husband is suffering from a very severe stress disorder. If you don't follow my instructions carefully, your husband will surely die.     "Each morning, fix him a healthy breakfast. Be pleasant at all times. For lunch make him a nutritious meal. For dinner prepare an especially nice meal for him.     "Don't burden him with chores. Don't discuss your problems with him; it will only make his stress worse. Do not nag him. Most importantly, make love to him regularly.     "If you can do this for the next 10 months to a year, I think your husband will regain his health completely."     On the way home, the husband asked his wife, "What did the doctor say?"     "He said you're going to die," she replied.|`|h8qqEFhXaa	I thought it was gunna be retarded and then Laughed so Hard almost fell outta my chair!  Good one!

IFf5r9zAaa	You know I agree. So many people talk about how they only like "lyrical" hip hop, but they listen to rappers who really aren't all that lyrical. That's not a diss to those rappers - artists like Run DMC and KRS-One are some of the all time greats and they deserve the love they get, but the truth is, they use pretty basic rhyme schemes and aren't really big on wordplay. <br>  <br>  Hip hop was never originally about lyricism. It was about the break beat, the b-boy and partying at its inception. So actually, club bangers with a great beat to dance to and turntablism are the two types that best reflect the roots of hip hop as music. <br>  <br>  People seem to have selective memories about the old school or seem to think that hip hop started when Sugar Hill Gang dropped Rappers Delight or Grandmaster Flash dropped The Message (btw, neither of these songs were written by the artists who performed them. Watch a "I hate everything new in hip hop" type tear a track released now to shreds for doing the same thing). <br>  <br>  Hip hop has elements. It's not just about rapping. And "lyrical" rap seems to basically cover everything that isn't Lil Wayne or Soulja Boy in some people's eyes. <br>  <br>  Hip hop at its inception was about partying and having fun. Of course it evolved into different things, all art does. But that was what it was about at the start.|`|vQANppluaa	hell yea good question... cause its 100% true.  the rap of today is just different.  but there are still alot of rappers that are very good and creative about what they say and feel.   old people dont like it cause its different....  if pac was still alive no one would be sayin anything about it.|`|XDvOwLlNaa	The Last Poets were one of the major influences on hip hop and they had TONS of meaning to their work...it depends if you call them hip hop tho|`|9wUrbqT3aa	To an extent I agree.   I dont think soically aware rap defines Hip Hop, cuz that form of hip hop didnt get big until later in the 80's.<br>  <br>  But....<br>  I think it is mostly old heads that miss the EPMD, RAkim & Eric B, NaS, Gernimo, BiG, etc that say that "Hip Hop is dead" & want a movement back to the late 80's & 90's type of Rap.  <br>  During hip hop golden era I was listening and buying CDs & havin debates on whos better etc.  I now hear the young heads mostly in my neck of da woods, ride wit Wayne or even Rich Boi when he was hot.  (Sad state of events)<br>  <br>  I think hip-hop roots stem from the community with heavy emphasis on competion.  Competition cuz everyone wanted to be the best/most respected.  Hip hop wasnt based on who could tell the biggest lie (Ex Rick Ross being a Big Time dope guy gettin dope of the docks)  Everyone lied to a degree, but it wasn't as rampant as today.  What happening to realistic hood tales.<br>  <br>  Ex - <br>  Pac never claim to be the biggest killa in the world.  <br>  Big whole swag wasn't some legnedary dope dealer.<br>  <br>  Now everyone is biggest dope dealer since Norega got locked up or the hardest guy walking with 10 toes on the streets.  It's absurd.... <br>  <br>  As Joe budden said "If everybody Thug, where are all the punks"... Everyone today is "Hard" or a dope dealer.  Even the guys makin dance music try to be thugs.|`|lMOXHh45aa	I agree. There was nothing impressive about 70's- early 80's hip hop lyrics, but they'll always make it out that way... and they always use "The Message" as their number one argument.-- I don't see a problem with it at all, but I honestly don't understand why there's such a big stress put on being "Socially Conscious and Political"... people wantin education from entertainment, but education from entertainment lol, don't understand <br>  <br>  EDIT: I fell away from the actual question, yeah alot of the people weren't even born, and i take hip hop for all it brings... so i can't say one type best represents it cuz that infers that it all should be that way.|`|u8hsZ7claa	Let's look at in simple terms...Take Special Ed at the height of his career...The Youngest in Charge  was created when he was just 16 years old and that album catapulted him in on to TV and heavy radio play back in the day...His message wasn't one of anything we haven't heard before (i.e. Lil Wayne) and what I seem to find most interesting is the only real difference between the Special Ed's or our world and every lil' Wayne type has more to do with money...I'm almost certain Mr. Ed (and not the horse of course) didn't make nearly the amount of money Wayne has so far and Wayne is by far a bigger and maybe even household name than Edward would have ever been... All in all hip-hop begins were you began with it...like any good relationship...mines just happens to be at almost the beginning of it all (at least state side) What best represents hip-hop is anything that is progressively moving forward just like with any other art form|`|AA11706809	and im gonna put it out there like this, i dont think the old stuff was really all that good. it was new, they led the way for other rappers, ya ya ya, but you're right, early hip hop wasnt exactly anything to write home about.<br>  <br>  i say, specifically about rapping, its about fun and dissing each other and being aggressive. people want rappers  to rap about rainbows and sunshine. i like rappers with great voices, funny lyrics, good beats, and i think that's good hip hop. it doesnt have to be introspective and deep to be good, but it can be that too.|`|hwKFm7H8aa	well its like talking about human evolution according to Darwin. <br>  <br>  Think of it like this ( I over simplified and exaggerated everything ) <br>  <br>  monkeys ( 70's 80's hiphop )<br>  Current humans ( 90's hiphop )<br>  <br>  BETTER humans ( underground hip hop right now )<br>  monkeys ( 00's hip hop... Lil wayne...soulja boy , florida and such ) <br>  <br>  <br>  Your suppose to go forward not backwards|`|2KAqLbqiaa	Yes. When hip hop first started, it was turntable-ism and breaking. It was a whole new form of creative expression, a totally new and undiscovered branch of music. Everyone knows that. I think that once people grew more familiar with it and more comfortable with it, it evolved into something different. That's where the politically charged lyrics came from. Once people knew EXACTLY what hip hop was, that's when they decided to change the game up.<br>  <br>  Now, I miss 80s and 90s hip hop because, to me, that really spoke to my soul. I got it, I understood it, and I embraced it. I miss that. I appreciate all of the hip hop pioneers like Nas and A Tribe Called Quest, Digable Planets, Pete Rock and C.L. Smooth...I could go on and on, but I really love what they've done. It's amazing.<br>  <br>  I hate this crap they've got now with hip hop. It's totally gone downhill and I hate it. No one knows how to rhyme anymore, there's no feeling, no real message, no true significance. I'll only lend my ear to a select few, like Common and Lupe Fiasco, because their music is the only music that makes sense and works for me.<br>  <br>  I miss when hip hop wasn't all about the business. I want that to come back. So for the time being, hip hop is dead. I'm just waiting for the resurrection.|`|yoVF60ORaa	hip hop isn't dead, but the living part is underground.  it's not that early rappers were lyrically inventive, that didn't come until the 90s, but they did begin hip hop by being original, something that mainstream mc's today are not...with the advances in technology and the ability to study precedents that we have today, there's no reason that current mc's shouldn't be able to make something original and intelligent...i think lupe fiasco is the manifestation of the genre's potential today...original beats, ill flow, lyrics that make you think, or paint a picture in your mind...you can save **** to dance to to the mainstream, but hip hop is its most vital in lyricists
pian616Daa	I love your description of the video. Also she has a unique contralo vocal style/range, the lowest of the female voice types. She has good control and a stong tone, I like her.|`|3untsNTlaa	I dont think its "weird".<br>  I think its more "Unique". Its quite different than other Artists.<br>  I enjoy her music.|`|B6TJGhwiaa	i love her voice|`|aT32JMQzaa	i love her voice i think its amazing|`|Xify43Taaa	not to me i think that her music is fun and i like to listen to it when i dont feel so hot(as upset)
G3NBadmmaa	I suck on the top until most of the chocolate is gone, then bite a little bit off to make a hole...then suck or lick all the cream out and shove the rest in my mouth...yea that sounds like I'm explaining something other than eating a cadbury egg doesn't it? lol|`|T7qgrOJzaa	It's cadbury's...and I just start nibbling at the top and work my way down. It can get messy ocassionally lol.|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	I don't they are to sweet and messy|`|jcL7gDMKaa	I like to break a hole in the top and try to suck the creme out with my tongue! haha There is a fish and chip shop where I live that used to do them deep fried! hmmmm clogged arteries!|`|9gMQAWBNaa	I bite off the more pointy end (or think its the more pointy end) and then bite until it leaks and then put the whole cabbries in my mouth. Yay Easter!|`|RgAVm7zCaa	I bite the top off and lick out some of the cream then just take bites until it's gone. Sometimes licking out more of the cream.<br>  <br>  xx-Shelby|`|HXpOui7gaa	never tried a CABBRIES cream egg, but the cadbury's ones are good.<br>  I like the cream out then eat the chocolate lol, mmm.|`|uD5wZgsEaa	I nibble a small piece of the chocolate from the top to reveal the cream.Then using the tip of my tongue I lick out all the cream just leaving an empty shell of chocolate.After that I nibble the rest of the chocolate with very small nibbles to make it last longer.|`|5M0yL2G9aa	I bite the top off then lick out all the cream...sometimes i eat the rest of chocolate and sometimes i throw it away...gotta love the creamy inside!|`|NBi07o6zaa	Nibble at the top and work your way down, maybe sucking out some of the cream on your way. Or just take a big bite into it.|`|uZ2sKUbOaa	errrm i bite off the chocolate top, like the cream out and then eat the remaining chocolate :P lasts longer that way :L x|`|PN7XMglOaa	I lick the chocolate until the cream is showing , then I eat the whole thing in one gulp .|`|eOb841qbaa	i bite it in half and then chew some and then eat the rest! (:|`|IUuUoiZhaa	i dont eat them|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I take my time.. So Yummy!|`|f7eCGDlSaa	I never ate one. Hard to eat something a bunny poops out!
T3X7Aci4aa	He's a more creative lyricist, but not a better lyricist.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Bfd B...I don't mind you calling Elzhi an amateur, but if Elzhi is an amateur, what makes Immortal Technique worthy of being compared to Nas?|`|RavvDVpVaa	This is a pretty good question, the only problem I see is, it seems like a lot RHH users would compare Elzhi to Nas (circa 91-95) instead of having Nas' whole career in mind. To answer your question Nas is a better lyricist but Elzhi deserves his props too, and I don't think it's "blasphemy" to compare the two unlike Nas Stans.|`|nAtBuBRhaa	Yes. I do actually think he is better. He is more creative also. Don't get me wrong, I am a die hard Nas fan. But, the lyricism doesn't compare to Elzhi. Okay, well let me first start off by saying Nas is the better rapper. His lyrics are more meaningful, at least too me, then Elzhi's. But, I truly think there are better lyricists then Nas. Not a lot, just some. Anyways, I think Elzhi is a better lyricist then Nas. But, Nas is the overall better MC.|`|EZb6kP0Maa	i think nas is better :)|`|xUxUwloPaa	No, i don't think so.
Uzg09g2laa	LOL  cheesy???  LOL  well, i've never gotten that feeling about her. i've seen (tv) and heard (radio) her on a few interviews and she appears to be very humble, shy, and friendly.  i know she pass a strong passion for doing music (but a lot of artists express this, right???).    personally, i am not too fond of her or her music.  she has a powerful and well-balanced vocal range but it does not hit my soul.  i think she's a great artist but i am just not into her or her music.  there are some singles that i like but will not find myself buying the cd of hers.  it's a weird feeling about her but to each his own, right???  :o))    I THINK SHE IS WHAT SHE IS!!!!!    A SINGLE WILL BLOOM OFF THE AIRWAYS AND EVENTUALLY FADE.....SHE IS LIKE A ROLLER COASTER, TO ME  --UP/DOWN/HIGH/LOW/ETC. AND AFTER AWHILE "WHO CARES".  you know what i mean?!?!?!!!!!!!!|`|63e2b17b3164430761f3403345c1c9cbaa	Honestly i think she is underrated. That being said i see what you mean when you say that she may come off cheesy. I like her voice but when i first hear her songs it's like a chinese flick. Like her flow and lyrics seem a bit off to me. She has a couple of songs that i like but i cant really get into her like that either.|`|cjknXzm9aa	i think of "in my mind" when her name is mentioned. not that big of a fan. somewhat underrated. her career never really took off.|`|YWAunLIXaa	I love her.   I think shes great|`|ROZQMRzxaa	I think she's great. Broadway is not a bad place to be when you're an artist.|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	Underrated. She was awesome in the Lion King on Broadway.|`|xmdh8iY3aa	I like this question, I don't think I've ever seen her name brought up.  Like yourself I've listened to her stuff but just can't get into it. She's very unique almost has a bit of a southern drawl when she sings. Looks like she' had more success on Broadway than in the studio.|`|C2olZsNiaa	I don't think she is overrated and that's because she isnt that popular.    I feel what you mean about cheesy cz I kinda thought that after I heard her sing the soundtrack for ...I think it was aladdin (or some soundtrack).  I do really like 2 songs:    He Is   I Wish I Wasn't

eKxPSMolaa	lol yeah its funny!  these are my favorite jokes!          An old man, a boy and a donkey were going to town. The boy rode on the donkey and the old man walked. As they went along they passed some people who remarked it was a shame the old man was walking and the boy was riding. The man and boy thought maybe the critics were right, so they changed positions.     Later, they passed some people that remarked, "What a shame, he makes that little boy walk." They then decided they both would walk!     Soon they passed some more people who thought they were stupid to walk when they had a decent donkey to ride. So, they both rode the donkey.     Now they passed some people that shamed them by saying how awful to put such a load on a poor donkey. The boy and man said they were probably right, so they decided to carry the donkey. As they crossed the bridge, they lost their grip on the animal and he fell into the river and drowned.     **The moral of the story? If you try to please everyone, you might as well kiss your @ss good-bye.**              Q: What's the difference between a drunk and a stoner?    A: A drunk runs a stop sign while a stoner waits for it to turn green.                  Sid and Al were sitting in a Chinese restaurant. "Sid," asked Al, "are there any Jews in China?"    "I don't know," Sid replied. "Why don't we ask the waiter?"    When the waiter came by, Al asked him, "Are there any Chinese Jews?"    "I don't know sir, let me ask," the waiter replied, and he went into the kitchen. He returned in a few minutes and said, "No, sir. No, Chinese Jews."    "Are you sure?" Al asked.    "I will check again, sir," the waiter replied and went back to the kitchen. While he was still gone, Sid said, "I cannot believe there are no Jews in China. Our people are scattered everywhere."    When the waiter returned he said, "Sir, no Chinese Jews."    "Are you really sure?" Al asked again.    "I cannot believe there are no Chinese Jews."    "Sir, I ask everyone," the waiter replied exasperated. "We have Orange Jews, Prune Jews, Tomato Jews and Grape Jews, but we have no Chinese Jews."                          bald guy walks into a bar, turns to the noticably short bartender, and says "Hey midget, gimme a beer!"    The bartender gives the man a beer, but tells the man not to refer to him as a midget.    A few drinks later, the guy turns to the bartender and again says, "hey midget... gimme another beer!"    The bartender gets upset and warns the man about calling him a midget, but gives him his beer.    After the thrid time this happens, the bartender says, "Hey! I told you to stop calling me a midget! How would you like it if I called you 'baldy' if our positions were reversed?"    The guy thinks about it and admits that he wouldn't mind. The bartender disagrees, and ultimately they agree to switch positions to let the man see how it feels.    The bartender moves to the front of the bar, and the guy moves to the back. The bartender says, "Hey baldy, gimme a beer!"    The guy leans over the bar and says, "Sorry, but we don't serve midgets here."|`|gbYVF1A5aa	Sex education may be a good idea in the schools, but I don't believe the kids should be given homework and practical "|`|OUAtUKZ1aa	Lol...

m12R3pEMaa	We know that it starts somewhere around an E6. It is possible<br>  to produce lower notes through the whistle register. It is believed to start below the E6 in guys, and around that tone in girls. Your regular range and voice type can also influence where exactly it starts. It's not a register that you can just access without any practice. It's also not known whether everyone even has this ability.<br>  <br>  You can try doing some exercises in your top range. The first few sounds coming from this register will probably sound like a small squeak. The sound is light and not strong. It may take several months before you are able to effectively control your whistle register. <br>  <br>  Please note that you need to be careful not to strain or damage your voice. Do not exercise the top range for more than a few minutes per day. If you are feeling strain than stop immediately.  It's not worth damaging your voice just to find a few extra notes that you may never use, but if you want to try then best of luck.

IPXV1K1naa	Screamo tends to bother me for the same reason: It is just so TONELESS. I don't know-- I just can't stand it. However I love it when hard rock or whatever has some screaming parts... But not screamo itself. Underoath can be okay... Some of the songs are good ( try "A Boy Brushed Red Living In Black"). Sorry, but Norma Jean is just really bad. Hahah. Breaking Benjamin, RED, Framing Hanley, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus, etc., are more my style. Another song they scream some in is "Rum Is For Drinking Not Burning" by Senses Fail -- You might like that one. It actually has a melody (wow! lol). <br>  <br>  Yeah, I don't like screamo either -- wayyy too hard; I like the occasional screaming (provided there is still something to sing to!) But I will just stick with my Story of the Year I think !|`|OTFzJbaMaa	we cant answer that only your friends can. too many teens like to play "folow the leader" and listen to things because its cool and crap its nothing short of pathetic. <br>  if you dont like something good for you for not going along with it and having a back bone. try asking them what it is they like most about it and see what they have to say, then youll probably find out if they do like it for the music of cuz others like it. <br>  <br>  im veryyyy into metal but i cant stand death metal it gives me a headache.|`|kP0JGI1waa	hey if you dont like it, you dont like it man thats just the way music is.  we all have our own tastes.  if you dont like those bands, maybe try some deathcore, its not repetitive and its definitely heavy.

1oKkHe0jaa	Well the main girl in The Hills is Lauren. She was previously on the show Laguna Beach, where it was just a bunch of high school people, drama, relationships and all that jazz. So then Lauren got her own show. Yes, cameras follow them around, and just film their life. I wouldn't necessarily say that it is scripted, but I do think the producers manipulate things to have the show go a certain way.. but who really knows. Whitney, the main girl on The City, was on The Hills as well, and now she has her own show. I think they are pretty good shows, but everyone is entitled to their opinion. Hope I helped. =]

Do some research and find the metal genre that you really enjoy. There's so many out there. Folk metal, black metal, death metal, power metal, thrash metal, and so many more. Once you find the genre(s) that you enjoy, look for bands that play that genre. Most bands don't just play one single genre, a lot like to mix them. <br>  <br>  Folk metal bands:<br>  kopiklaani<br>  ensiferum<br>  eluveitie<br>  xiv dark centuries<br>  tyr<br>  aes dana<br>  <br>  Black metal:<br>  dimmu borgir<br>  immortal<br>  dissection<br>  mayhem<br>  <br>  death metal:<br>  morbid angel<br>  death<br>  children of bodom<br>  insomnium<br>  krisiun<br>  nile<br>  <br>  power metal:<br>  mercenary<br>  rhapsody<br>  blind guardian<br>  helloween<br>  <br>  thrash metal:<br>  slayer<br>  metallica(early)<br>  anthrax<br>  iced earth<br>  <br>  Alot of these bands aren't pure of their genre, they're mixed with others. Check out <a href="http://www.metal-archives.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metal-archives.com/</a> and there's a huge list of bands you might want to check out.

sc4BtGxGaa	Ah - Scanning and OCR programs - we love to hate them!  If you cannot find this in MIDI ( which you can open in a a program like Finale or Sibelius, and tweak away). you can scan in the C parts (I use the advanced Neuratron program that functions with Sibelius) and than build a score, and transpose the entire SCORE - as well as the internal transpositions of the parts.  Yes, I have done this COUNTLESS times.  No matter how good the manufacturer tells you that the OCR recognition of their item, be prepared to spend some time with the - the LEARNING curve is hardly the Bunny Slope.  Even the wrong DPI in the scan makes the difference between decent and mayhem.  <br>  <br>  I do not use Lilypond, and am not familiar with it.
