If you have no water in the ice tray, then the ice maker may faulty and it may not be sending power to the water valve or the water valve might be stuck closed not allowing water to enter. Check to make sure the fill tube that lets water into the ice maker is not frozen with water. If it is, you may have a water valve with a slow leak that will need to be replaced.

Paint or remove paint from fireplace to get that natural stone look and cover the recliner in whatever color you want. Can buy these Target or online. Don't know the mantle look but have it marbled or re-stained to bring the beauty out.

I know this because I am a messy person.<br>  <br>  Start with one area, like a dresser or even a corner of the room when you have an hour or so.<br>  Have 3 boxes ready: for giving away, storage, and stuff you're going to put back.  Everything has to go into one of those boxes or into the trash.  Clean that area thoroughly before you put anything back.<br>  <br>  Rule of thumb for cleaning out closets and dressers:  If you haven't looked at it in a year, it goes into the trash or give-away box.  <br>  The stuff you put into storage should go under the bed or at the very back of the closet.  Don't store off-season sports stuff in your bedroom if possible.   <br>  <br>  Eventually, as you sort through your stuff, you'll find that you don't need all that furniture.  Trade a wide dresser for a taller one that takes up less floor space.  Put shelves on the walls and store movies, papers, and little things in boxes that are the same size.  This can make things look neater.  <br>  Perhaps you could take out the hamper and just take your laundry straight to the laundry room every morning.<br>  <br>  I have found that hanging onto stuff I don't use or need just makes life busier and more stressful.

Get a friend and take a weekend, pull everything out of the closet and sort it o the bed, throw away, give away, store elsewhere, everything you possibly can.

Store your hamper in the bathroom because who wants to sleep with their stinky sports clotes.  Go to a thrift store and buy a used entertainment center or an old armoire, for the tv and books and papers and movies bags purses and jewelery.  Use a desk as a nightstand and get rid of the nightstand, then you can have aplace to set your bedside lamp and study .  Hope this helps|`|u1IPTgm7aa	You should put your shoes under your bed.
QomVD1ceaa	Find the circuit breaker for the furnace and turn it off-for 1minute and turn back on. Sounds like it tripped over Temperature.switch. This will reset your furnace.<br>  <br>                                      Good luck.|`|OTBYJtKkaa	First you need to understand what happens with the blower on your furnace. The blower motor typically operates at two different speeds. When you are in the cooling mode, the blower runs on its high speed winding. When you are in the heating mode, it runs on the low speed winding. When the thermostat's fan switch is set to the "auto" position, the blower will run at the high speed for cooling and the low speed for heating. When its set to "on", the blower motor runs on the high speed and runs constantly. You don't say how old the unit is so I'm going to tell you about older models first and newer models second. On older furnaces there is a temperature sensitive device called the fan limit switch which will control the blower motor during the heating mode. The thermostat senses that the temperature in the house is low and sends a signal (24 Volts) to the gas valve causing it to open. The natural gas flows to the burner assembly and is ignited by the pilot light. The temperature in the heat exchanger begins to rise. As the heat exchanger warms, the fan limit switch senses that increasing temperature. When the temperature in the exchanger has risen sufficiently, a set of contacts in the fan limit switch closes and allows voltage (120 Volts) to energize the blower motor. The blower motor begins moving air through the heat exchanger and that air is heated. The warm air then travels through the ductwork to the vents in your home and mixes into the room air to raise the room temperature. When the temperature near the thermostat has approached the set point on the thermostat, a set of contacts in the thermostat opens and the 24 Volts going to the gas valve is turned off. The gas valve closes and the flame goes out. The temperature in the heat exchanger is still fairly high so the blower continues to run, allowing that heat to be sent into your home rather than wasted. As the heat exchanger cools down, the fan limit switch senses the decrease. When it has cooled sufficiently, the contacts in the fan limit switch open and the blower shuts off. The temperature in your home should be within about 1 degree of the set point you had the thermostat set for. It's now ready to go through the process again when it is needed. If for some reason the blower did not start, the temperature in the heat exchanger could rise to an unsafe level and potentially be a fire hazard. The fan limit switch has 2 sets of contacts in it. The first set turns on the blower and the second protects you from the fire hazard. If the temperature in the heat exchange is too great the second set of contacts opens and shuts off the 24 Volts to the gas valve so the flame will go out. On newer furnaces, the fan limit switch has been replaced with an electronic control board with a built in time delay for energizing the blower motor. It does not sense the temperature of the heat exchanger to control the blower, it merely delays allowing the blower to be energized for a set period of time, allowing the warm up to occur. There is still a temperature sensitive device located near the heat exchanger to act as the limit switch and prevent a fire hazard. <br>  If your thermostat's fan switch is set to "on" air will move through the heat exchanger faster than it should and will not warm up as much as it is supposed to do. Make sure it is set to the "auto" position and try to keep it there always. If no air blows from the vents, something is preventing the blower from operating. It may be as simple as a very dirty filter which will not allow air to pass through it or it may be that the blower motor has failed and simply will not turn. Check to see if the burner lights and then turns off after a short time. That will be an indication that the limit switch is opening and the blower motor is probably bad. The motor can be replaced but it will have to be replaced with one that is the right size and configuration for the unit. It is also possible that the fan limit switch has failed and simply will not energize the blower motor. Again, that is something that can be replaced, but it will need to be one that is the correct size for your unit. If you have a newer unit, it may be that the electronic control board has failed and will no longer energize the blower motor. There are a great number of control boards and you will need the correct one for your unit. The parts are typically sold at hvac supply houses that only sell to licensed hvac contractors. My best advice is to have a qualified hvac service technician come in and check out what is happening. There are several other possible problems that could be occuring with your furnace and the technician will know how to diagnose the problem and where to locate the correct replacement parts for your unit. The diagnosis should take less than 30 minutes time. Whatever part or parts you need, the technician should be able to tell you how much the parts will cost, whether they are in stock on his truck or need to be picked up from a supply house, and how much the labor will be before the work is actually performed. I hope this helps.|`|nD2PwaBLaa	There is an internal thermometer that calls on the fan when the furnace temp reaches between 160 and 200 degrees F. It works for both on and off so that the furnace is cooled below ignition temp before the fan stops blowing. Seek professional help to get it repaired you have a serious fire hazard if the furnace is burning wide open and no air flow to keep it regulated inside.|`|I58YXWHyaa	sounds to me like it could be the motor that makes the blower work.  Either way, I would call a heating and air person asap!  It could possible cause carbon minoxide buildup which is deadly.  Not wanting to scare you but your problem is potentially very serious.

The one in the rear is a white, either tear drop shaped or long and skinny shaped, plastic piece with a dark center and two spade terminals, one on each end.  It's held in by a small 1/4" hex head screw on one end.  Simply remove the back,find the white fuse, take out the screw, take the wire leads off the terminals and remove the fuse.  Reverse the procedure to install.    The one on the side of the heat chamber should be a small, either silver or black little thermostat, (this one is actually called a hi-limit thermostat), with two spade terminals, also probably held on by a small screw.  Same procedure, except it's tougher to get inside than to just take the back off.    You'll need your model no. to get a new one of whichever one  you wind up needing.

b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	You have an electric water heater and the two blue panels are your heating elements.<br>  They each have separate thermostats and will turn on and off at different times.<br>  In most residential water heaters only one element is on at any given time. The lower element does 90% or more of the heating. During periods of heavy use, the upper element switches on (the lower switches off) and heats the upper part of the tank to 120°F. It then shuts off, turns on the lower, and it heats the water to the setting of the lower thermostat.

It seems that most times, banana-growers take and root cuttings.|`|J2IWbhSvaa	They do have seeds otherwise they wouldn't be fruit! LOL.

You have to look carefully to actually see them|`|b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	While the original bananas contained rather large seeds, triploid (and thus seedless) cultivars have been selected for human consumption. These are propagated asexually from offshoots of the plant. The plant is allowed to produce 2 shoots at a time; a larger one for fruiting immediately and a smaller "sucker" or "follower" that will produce fruit in 6–8 months time.<br>  <br>  This means they don't actually plant seeds but branches of the existing tree.

Z6CxgQPEaa	From the description that you give, it sounds like the crack is just a byproduct of the foundation settling. In a house that is almost 60 years old, that would be expected. Usually these cracks form, and they never cause much of a problem. The only thing that you said that scares me a little bit is that it's around a window. This can lead to pressure building on the window and it shattering. My house is only 20 years old, and there are some cracks in our foundation too. It happens. <br>  <br>  Being a contractor, I would say it is always a good idea to get a house checked out by a building inspector. If you are serious about the house, have one come out and look things over. If they do find anything serious, forget it. If they find some minor things that can be fixed, you can use that as leverage to get the price down.|`|c097c1011041fad908830a01a920f94aaa	the fact that the crack is in the basement ...below ground level ..tells me there is outside pressure ...run a string line from end to end and see how much it has bowed ...one thing for sure ...they only ever get worst ..get a structural engineer to give it a look|`|ik7vqqdnaa	A home inspection is cheap compared to fixing a potentially major problem down the road. I agree with getting a home inspection. They cost around $150 in my area.<br>  <br>  They will inspect the entire house to find other potential problems as well. If the crack is a structural issue a home inspector will be able to tell how bad it is.<br>  <br>  A 50 year old house has a lot of potential problems and a qualified home inspector knows what to look for. For example:<br>  <br>  How old is the roof?<br>  Is the siding in good condition?<br>  The foundation in good condition?<br>  Is it structurally sound?<br>  Is the attic properly ventilated?<br>  Is the heating system in good repair?<br>  Electric in need up upgrading?<br>  Plumbing in good condition?<br>  <br>  There are over 200 things a home inspector looks at when inspecting a home. Not just the foundation.<br>  <br>  You can cover up a lot of the evils with drywall and carpet but there are a lot of things that will tell him/her about the overall condition of the house. <br>  <br>  And potentially save you a lot of money down the road. As well as giving you some bargaining chips to help you get the price of the house down to cover the potential problem's cost.|`|dXrHoLMCaa	please don't invest thousands of dollars into a home on the strength of what we'd say here.... get a REAL house inspector and pay for the inspection like you should..... <br>  <br>  it may well be nothing, but it could also be a place for a water leak to show up, or for the floor joists above it to sag or a spot where insects could get in, or just about anything... my son's house has a crack like that in the brick and it moves as the ground gets sodden with water or dries out.... took a bundle for them to jack up his house and fix that mess.... so know what you're really getting into, k?...|`|944iJNAdaa	If the crack is tight all the way along, this doesn't sound too worrying to me in a 50 year old house, if everything else seems structurally ok.  I'd be more worried if there was a big gap in the crack, or if it was wider at the top versus the bottom, or vice versa.  Then, I'd be more worried that maybe the earth was still shifting.  The crack you're describing doesn't sound too concerning to me.|`|sqUVjpElaa	Should be fine, just go and get some filler to seal it.  We bought our house 3 yrs ago, and it had 3 cracks in the basement walls.  Only once did the one crack leak, so we sealed it and fixed the gutters outside.  (was a foreclosed home).

AA12382612	What is the material of the "bowl?" Is it ceramic, plastic, stainless steel? That would help us answer your question.<br>  <br>  Just remember, bleach does not kill mold, but trisodium phosphate (TSP) does, in strong solution, that's what Spin-N-Span is, but a stronger TSP may be purchased for cleaning mold and walls, and washing them before painting when they have strong colors and wallpaper that needs removing. And, it depends on how you clean, rinse, and use the "bowl" in question. <br>  <br>  I cannot see any reason if the bowl is not porous, why you cannot wash it well in warm, soapy water, and soak it for a couple of hours in white vinegar, rinse and dry it well, why you cannot use it again. <br>  <br>  The questions still remains, however, and what was in it that caused the "mold" to grow on it - how do you know it is the mold organism?|`|AA10882637	if the bowl was porous, meaning water or fluids can soak into it's surface, then no, because there is the possibility that some mold spore may still be present. If the bowl was made of foam plastic like polystyrene( the white plastic cup stuff) throw it away to be safe.<br>  <br>  If the bowl was hard plastic, or non porous, like glazed ceramic, glass or metal, then when you wash the article thoroughly, in hot water with a common dish soap. it should kill the mold and it's reproductive sprores, making it safe to use again. Make sure it's dry before storing it, and if the mold came from spoiled food in the fridge, do yourself a favor and check ALL the food in that fridge for mold or spoilage to prevent possible food poisoning or sickness.

Good luck.<br>  <br>  In the future, remember that keeping clothing clean is not related to "bluing agents," or detergents, they often accumulate in the fabrics, and today's fabrics are most often re-woven from those castoffs we've donated to large nonprofits like Salvation Army, Goodwill, etc. which sells them in bales off-shore. In turn, they're sent back to us in the guise of "new fabrics" only to wear out quickly, or difficult to clean, etc. So, use white vinegar and washing soda, instead of detergents.

When I drained mine, I hooked it up to a water hose and ran the water hose to the outside water faucet.  Then you attach it to an adapter that syphens out the water and hook it up to your faucet.<br>  <br>  You have to turn the water on to get it started.  You close the adapter and turn the water on and when the water starts going into your mattress you open up the adapter and it makes the water come out.  I did this at an apartment I lived in too but I used the bathroom sink instead.  It comes out really slow too.  After it really starts flowing out, unscrew it from the faucet and just lay it in the yard(or bathtub if your draining it in an apartment.

I think your plant is trying to down size since you don't have enough light as you said so it's not getting enough energy to sustain all of it's leaves and branches. Of course it will get rid of some of it parts to sustain the main trunk and few branches. If this is not the case, the base of the plant might be rotten and it's dying from base to top. I hope not though. In which case you can easily grow new plant from the top of these branches that are dying. Too much water can cause this to happen.<br>  <br>  Just take those branches that are shriveling and stick it on a new pots and sit them on the window sill. You'll get good result for sure. This way even if the mother plant, in case die, you'll have new ones. Just keep the soil moist only, you'll be fine. If worst comes to worst, you can even grow new jade plants from it's leaves alone. Just lay it down on moist medium and they'll produce new baby plants from the base of the leaves. I hope you can revive your plant. Good luck.|`|0a1a41d1a85d4d9bb8ccdfab73fe6ad5aa	I would guess too much water.  The stems shrivel up and the plant eventually dies.  Take some healthy stem off and pot it in some succulent potting mix and you may be able to grow a new plant from the old.  Most house plants don't need much watering in winter, so cut back the watering if you are watering regularly.  Just water when it needs it.

Gzk1TQFAaa	The musty odor is an indication of too much humidity.  Wash the cover.  If possible, leave the mattress in a room with a de-humidifier running.  Close the bathroom door if there's one nearby or the de-humidifier will take the water from the toilet.  Another thing you could do is spray the mattress with an odor-neutralizer, like Febreze.  Make sure the mattress dries thoroughly before placing it back on the frame.  ( a blow-dryer might help).|`|AA12382612	If there is a cover on it, remove that and wash in, or slip the stitching on it, remove the cover, and wash that.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, spray the entire mattress with white vinegar, and put it in the sun.

dgkv9DrSaa	Personally, I think shock collars aren't effective, and a little too barbaric. How about a really long leash, so he can be tied to a tree, and still play with the kids? <br>  <br>  I hope you find a solution! I know I have 5 acres, ALL of it is fenced for our dogs, but it is quite expensive to do so.|`|tdQTZPI7aa	shock collars only work if you have your eye on the dog at all times when outside.  We have 40 plus acres but limited our dog to a small area for when nature called The collar was used only to train for this space..  Any other time he was not out alone. Did not wear the shock collar.  With traditional training he learned to stay on command.<br>  The fence works but that is a large area and expensive.  Better if the kids just kept the dog on a leash when outside.|`|lLm5uIuDaa	An electric fence isn't a good idea for your kids or anyone else's and in fact not so much for adults either.  An invisible fence is the best option for everyone.|`|B4O3f8w6aa	Neither will work without personal training involved. Open the box for the electric fence (I assume you are talking about the ones buried in the ground made for pets). You will find that you need to train the dog to see the little white flags included, and watch the reaction when he gets shocked. Many dogs will put up with the momentary pain if chasing another animal. Shock collars are basically to stop barking, and if the dog is not aware it is for keeping him in a certain perimeter, he will become confused.|`|bEoiVqa7aa	Your dog is still a puppy !!<br>  <br>  Shock collars are cruel.<br>  Electric fences do not work, if the dog wants to get out and after something, it will.<br>  <br>  Bite the bullet and properly fence your property. <br>  <br>  It will be less expensive than having to bury and replace your puppy if she gets out and run over, poisoned - or worse.|`|49bc95e536997e2638ca74e09150ae4faa	More info is needed.  What kind or how big is your dog, age of kids, etc.  Larger dogs generally do not train properly with underground fences with shock collars, but smaller dogs do. Electric fences work, but younger child run a risk of hurting themselves with one.  Also, electric fences can cost more in the end than underground if your dog is intelligent enough to dig under or jump over, so you need extra wiring.  My dog actually learned to step through an electric fence.  Invisible fences can work if you have a paved driveway, they have rubber covers that the fence can sit under on top of your driveway to keep an unbroken line. Underground fencing with the shock collar is most likely the way to go.  They also have shock collar systems available that require no invisible fence, that run with a base system installed in your home and have a selectable radius of distance from the base that the dog is permitted to go without having to install anything underground.|`|iiUQzGPLaa	The shock collar would probably be effective... if you could actually watch your dog 24/7 and condition him each time he has a misadventure into an area where you do not want him to be. I think the underground fence would be more effective since it works all the time, although after a period of time they will condition the dog to stay away from them even if they stop working. I have heard of a case where the fence had been disabled and the dog chased a rabbit past the fence boundary and as soon as the dog realized it had passed the fence it immediately abandoned the chase and returned to the yard even though no shock was delivered! So the fence option would probably me my choice if I were me and in your situation. Good luck with your decision.

DlSZPMxiaa	If your curtains are made of 100% cotton, or another natural fiber such as linen or hemp, you can try to lighten their color with household bleach (which contains hypochlorite). Don't use bleach on any synthetic fiber, though, such as nylon or polyester, as it will damage them permanently.<br>  <br>  Rit Color Remover is safe to use on both natural and synthetic fibers. It might lighten the color of your curtains. It works best in nearly boiling water. There's no predicting whether or not color remover or bleach will work, though, until you try it. Sometimes one will work, or the other will; sometimes neither will work at all. If you decide to try both bleach and color remover, wash thoroughly in between, because you should not mix these chemicals together.<br>  <br>  Having removed as much color as you can, you can then use an optical brightener to make the curtains look a slightly brighter white. You can order a very concentrated optic brightener from Dharma Trading Company, or you can use Rit Whitener and Brightener. Both of these products contain a fluorescent chemical that absorbs invisible ultraviolet light and emits it as bright bluish light, making things appear "whiter than white".

Z0hgioE8aa	If you don't have a compost pile, then start one this year so you can add this to you soil.  To me it sounds like you need to add lots of organic matter to your soil to increase its productivity.  The rotting you see on the tomatoes is actually from a lack of calcium in the soil.  This can be prevented by working epsom salts into the top few inches of the soil once a month.  I have encountered this in the past primarily with the Roma variety of tomatoes but it is possible with other varieties as well.  I till my garden twice a year, once in the fall when the garden is done and right before planting my new garden.  I would also suggest checking the alkalinity/acid level of your soil and this can affect how well your plants do as well.  Remember that plants like cabbage and broccoli are cold weather plants and will do better than some other plants.  Green beans and peas and other plants that reach maturity faster will yield you better results as well.  Zucchini is another that I would recommend to you.

The white ads height and space to the room, giving it a classic look|`|FXnHE7mmaa	Paint your ceilings and trim off white...white is too much of a contrast..off white will look classy...I have many dark coloured walls and all my trim and ceilings are done in the same off white to match all the way throughout the home.|`|l9xnybUMaa	White or pale blue grey is best, ideal is white ceilings with offwhite trim around doors and windows, this shows off architecture best and keeps rooms looking open and light while using rich colors on the walls.<br>  I like your color scheme, try sherwinwilliams.com to try it|`|YsQQ30YJaa	It's up to you of course, but it is my understanding that a light colored ceiling brings light to the room and the illusion of a higher ceiling than is actually there.|`|kmxU9qXbaa	It would look good either way but you could also do an off white which would be creative and stylish
hKJIDdVqaa	Theoretically, yes drinking too much water can kill you. But not for any of these reasons.  This is called water intoxication/hyper hydration/or water poisoning. The reason it kills you is due to depleting all the salt, vitamins and minerals in your body.  Healthy people have generally nothing to worry about.  Excessive amounts of water can fatally disturb the brain when the balance of electrolytes is disturbed.  Most deaths have occurred from excessive drinking water contests.  Drinking 2.6 gallons of water in a matter of minutes could actually kill you.  Space it out, you will be fine.<br>  As for diet eat natural, no processed foods, and eat raw fruits and veges as much as possible.  Do crunches, or sit up, or jogging.|`|N73oZyY8aa	Too much water causes something ( I forget the name) where you flush out necessary stuff your body needs and it isn't healthy.|`|flkVehA9aa	Are you a plant of some kind?  This is the gardening section.  Yes, plants can die from too much water.<br>  <br>  People can also die from drinking too much water, but you have to drink huge amounts of water.  Probably a lot more than you have been drinking.<br>  <br>  It's called water intoxication.|`|cfcuBxdsaa	it is a known fact that your body is mostly composed of water i doubt very seriously if you can ever consume enough to kill you although you may end up with a bloated stomach listen to your grandma who is a nurse she is telling you right.|`|44540e3b2d88d3022031e0114909bc72aa	<a href="http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/hydrationandfluid/a/Hyponatremia.htm" rel="nofollow">http://sportsmedicine.about.com/od/hydra...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  read about it there.    :)|`|p0guNQhiaa	Essentially, if you drink too much water and your body can't get rid of it fast enough, it waters down your blood and greatly reduces the oxygen carrying capability of the blood or your cells burst. It's technically a form of water poisoning (weird I know).<br>  <br>  There was actually a high profile case about this last year. There was a radio station (in California I believe) that was holding a contest called 'Hold your Wee for a Wii'. Essentially, they gave each of the contestants a glass of water and they had to consume this water at regular intervals. The last person who used the washroom, won the contest. One of the contestants actually got water poisoning and died as a result of the contest (trying to win a Wii for her kids no less).<br>  <br>  If you don't believe me, here's a link to an article about the contest: <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16614865/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16614865/</a><br>  <br>  So the bottom line is, yes you can die from water poisoning, but you have to drink enough to dilute your blood to the point that its oxygen carrying ability is reduced to such a point that your body is no longer receiving the oxygen it requires to survive. The other point is that your cells can burst from too much water due to osmosis. If the liquid in the water surrounding your cells has a higher water concentration than the liquid inside the cells the water will travel via osmosis (diffusion) into the cell and if it occurs at a rate that is faster than your cells can pump the water back out, the cell may burst. You're likely never going to drink enough water or hold it in your system long enough to kill yourself.<br>  <br>  But for the record, diet alone isn't enough to get in shape. You need to exercise too.|`|6iI4xhFbaa	Drinking too much water CAN kill you, although it has to be an awful lot.  Generally your body will tell you when to stop.<br>  <br>  In a radio contest one time multiple participants played a game in which they tried to drink more water than the rest.  The winner, who drank lots and lots of water, died within hours of the contest due to the water intake.<br>  <br>  The cells in your body contain water.  The more water you take in that your body cannot process fast enough ends up going wherever it can, which means your cells take in more water than they can handle.  Your blood is affected.  I don't know the exact anatomical or physiological processes that create the problems, but it's something like what I describe.|`|u0Y1kDlUaa	Anyone hear about the girl who died doing a radio contest to win concert tickets and the challenge required you to drink a large amount of water and see who could hold off on going to the bathroom the longest.  I believe her kidneys failed or something like that, however, I hope you wouldn't willingly drink a lot of water and then try to hold it in.<br>  <br>  But ANYTHING in excess could kill you, unfortunately....the human body is like a soap bubble|`|d9f5eef57376876109b9a113a7c9af2eaa	Technically, there is such a thing as water poisoning - but we'd be talking about many many gallons.  It's almost impossible to do to yourself if you're not trying to hurt yourself.  I've only heard of one case - an abusive parent who forced their kid with violence and made them drink an absurd number of gallons at a sitting.<br>  <br>  Most Americans don't drink enough water.  Listen to your Grandma.|`|ySOru4gsaa	You can hurt yourself by drinking too much water because it dilutes the electrolytes in your body but it's unlikely that you'd drink too much in normal circumstances. Most cases of water poisoning come from contests or very intensive exercise.|`|AdoTLU0xaa	No, you are not killing yourself right now at all, but clinically, it is possible to cause severe damage (which  may prove fatal) by drinking very very large amounts of water (in excess of 6 litres per day)<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question|`|d6lKqveyaa	you can flush your body to the point where there is no salts left in your body. so if you drink 3 gallons a day and then run up a mountain, then that can kill you. your mother is half right, but still pretty stupid|`|W7IKifoEaa	yes but u have to drink a lot.

w5VxhlF8aa	is the white part of the wall wood? looks like it, I would suggest a light yellow, don't know how you are going to change color of tile without removing them, but you didn't say, I'm sure you are. If you are removing the tiles, I would suggest lowering the level of the tiles a bit, too close to the ceiling, makes the room look boxed in, which will make it appear smaller. e-mail me if you like|`|CpLLA6Niaa	I would go with the lighter of the two yellows if I were choosing yellow.  How about changing out your light fixture, too?  If you can't swing getting a new one, try spraypainting it something like a metallic color...hammered metals turn out cool in the spray paint department.  As far as the color goes, I really like the green you have up now....but if forced to make a change, I'd probably go with a light tan or "coffee with cream" color...but that's just me.
a47cAPypaa	Sounds like you have an air lock in the radiator, if you find a small screw on the end of the rad at the top gently unscrew using a small key (available from D.I.Y. stores) as soon as the air/bubbles stop close the screw and the rad should work fine.|`|54ef14aee629dde270e28b8db2534f5daa	not necessarily but usually air collects in the radiator furthest away from the boiler,,,all water contains air when its heated the air is released ,it has to go somewhere and its the top of the radiator which is cold and the bottom hot,CH systems need "bleeding"on a fairly regular basis,the radiator has no thermostat for a reason,namely if every radiator in your system had an individual thermostat then the whole system could shut down leaving the boiler running and an explosion would be the result,depends  on system size whether 1 or 2 have no thermo,you need to get a radiator key/top right/or left a square screw and open it with the key,,it wont burn you as you will hear it,open screw and you hear air hissing from radiator and as soon as water starts to come out tighten the screw again,you only need to loosen the screw a couple of half turns if its hissing dont turn it too far|`|dcKUZCnOaa	Hi, Like the other answer's have said the rad needs venting, but if this occurs again seek a Professionals advice. A well installed system should NOT need venting  at all. Air+Water+steel=corrosion=costly repairs & inefficiency. Hope this helps:):):)|`|YGSZgJuVaa	Sounds like your radiator/s are needing bled.

cff15c1430c57bf7fd07d037045ba112aa	What you have is a very nice specimen of a tree called "Portugal Laurel" (prunus lusitanica)... It also goes by the name of Portuguese Cherry Laurel or Evergreen Bay Tree....Some say that the berries are poisonous and some say they are not... I don't know which to believe as I have not ingested any before. Here is a pic of one specimen about the same size as your photo.

D7Dubtt9aa	The council will not allow you to not pay rent due to a repair. When I moved into my first flat it was a state we had wires coming out of electric points and even found needles in the flat. You need to ring them monday chances are they will fix it monday don't stress good luck. The councils have guide lines on how long a repair will take and as long as they stick to that there is nothing you can do.|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	As they have said they will do the repairs, you cannot legally withold any rent. You can use a table lamp plugged into a wall socket for the time being.|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	I feel your pain. I had to contend with horrendous repair issues in my property. However, you have signed the tenancy agreement which means you are bound by the rules of this agreement. I stand by your wanting to withhold payment but this means they can use this as grounds to evict you. Sorry. My advice...keep a log of who you speak to and when concerning the problem. Contact the repairs manager and lodge a complaint. They are bound by rules to fix repairs (if it falls under their responsibility) within a certain time frame. Good luck.
AA10051049	It is possible that the flywheel key is sheared.  This happens when you hit something with the blades and stop the engine suddenly. You will have to remove the engine cowling and the flywheel nut to see if the keyways are aligned.  The flywheel nut is torqued to about 60 ft lbs. Usually the engine backfires when the key is sheared.  Most likely it is the starter.  There is a pinion gear on the top of the starter that engages the flywheel ring gear. Check those two gears.  The gear on the starter is easy to change and is about $5.00.  It could be that the starter needs new brushes and a good cleaning.  This is a little harder job.  The brushes are a bit trickey to get back in but it is a  job that most can do.  Another thought, the solenoid may be bad.  Check the voltage at the starter with the key in the start position.  It should be 12 volts.  And check all the connections.|`|0GUZlo4Iaa	sounds like the flywheel key maybe sheared off. that puts it out of time and really cranks hard|`|ww12lItvaa	Weak starter is likely. <br>  <br>  First pull the plugs and see if it cranks easily without the pressure. <br>  <br>  If you tipped it over, or overfilled it with oil you might have got oil in the cylinders and that seals them up so well it causes a compression lock. If when you crank it over without the plugs and it blows out a lot of oil from the plug hole then that is what happened.<br>  <br>  But it could be busted up inside, like a bad connector bearing on the pistons.

5CYn53zSaa	As soon as the ground isn't frozen.  Trees are mostly dormant now, but they'll have less shock from transplanting if they are not putting out their new needles.  The roots will have a chance to get established--but won't really grow much.|`|N73oZyY8aa	You don't want to shock the tree. I know its an evergreen but its been inside so setting it out while there is still a chance of freezing is not wise. Wait until the ground thaws and the soil temperature rises.

I planted a cedar spruce, it was at deaths door and I was advised to dig it up.  However, I watered it with nothing more than the washing up water every day during the summer and it completely revived.

If necessary, repeat procedure.|`|AaoclPYCaa	Pour straight bleach on directly on the stain then wash it as normal.  This should take out the stain and brighten the white.
