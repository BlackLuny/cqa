I always make too much, too, so I'm good at figuring out what to do with the rest.  You can also use extra tartar sauce to make tuna salad, chicken salad, ham salad, bologna salad or a homemade Slim Jim (that sandwich classic from Big Boy).<br>  <br>  Otherwise, throw it out (egads!) after a week.|`|kjgonYlgaa	Don't keep it for more than a week.<br>  Pick up a jar of prepared tartar sauce.

f0ad6531ce43c9c2d656b52953c68bd7aa	The answer is no because if you can read, you are eligible to be vegan, congrats!<br>  You do not necessarily need to cook every meal and snack, just take a look at this website of completely vegan products that are available at any grocery store;<br>  <a href="http://www.peta.org/accidentallyVegan/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.peta.org/accidentallyVegan/de...</a><br>  I would personally cut off egg then dairy, because it takes time to perfect the art of veganism.|`|64554a8e1157e502654f643d0ffe309baa	No, its not hard at all for me. I just have gotten good at reading labels on food items when I go shopping. It also helps to shop at places like farmer's markets, health food stores, and road side stands than grocery shops.  I admit, I do cook/prepare most all of my food myself instead of relaying on prepackaged food. <br>  <br>  There are plenty of replacements and transition foods, its not like these days you have to go without. There's "ice cream" made from coconut milk, yogurt made from soy, milk made from almonds, and of course Sheese and tofurky. There's a replacement for just about anything you can think of.|`|IyJK1nrKaa	Use soy!! It's a perfect substitute for milk. And if you want, you can use artificial egg as well. All you need is the determination to do it. Remember what to avoid and what substitutes you can use and you will be fine.<br>  <br>  By the way, Vegan.com has some nice tips to help you if you need it.|`|DauMaNUjaa	for me at least it's really easy. i've become a pro at making vegan things at restaurants out of sides and things from different entrees. one time i got some mushroom ravioli that was supposed to be served with steak (i checked and double checked and the ravioli was vegan) along with this delicious basil tomato sauce. it was so good!|`|xh4LTb6vaa	It depends on your country - it's hard to be a vegetarian when eggs and milk are present in almost everything, and there are no special shops or markets for vegetarians.<br>  P.S: I live in Russia|`|cqluTdrDaa	The only thing it takes is self-discipline.<br>  There are lots of restaurants with vegetarian meals, just beware if you want to be a vegetarian, good luck!|`|PfIXJ2NMaa	its hard to do because i am used to eating a steak once a week if not more i cant go that long without meat.|`|yOK32PM9aa	I found it quite easy to make the change.  It depends on social/domestic circumstances, and lots of questions here are from kids whose parents disapprove - that makes it a lot harder!  Use soya in its many forms: tofu, tempeh, soya milk, TVP, etc.  Mycoproteins are good, but beware egg additives (Quorn is not vegan).  You might need to re-think what you cook, and approach from a different cultural perspective - southern Indian has a lot going for it!  Rice base for carbs and some protein; veg sauce/topping with soya for the protein.  Good luck!|`|2RzEaod9aa	I think you mean "wean" yourself, not "wing" yourself.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I went from omnivore to vegan overnight. No baby steps, not vegetarianism in between. What helps you make the choice easier is after a couple weeks, you get really sick eating milk and sometimes egg, and the last thing you want to do is "enjoy" your salad with cheese and a side of vomit.<br>  <br>  I work 3 jobs and am into weights, so I have to eat all the time. I almost always make everything I consume. I just bring ingredients to work and make it happen. I made some chili with polenta the other day, and udon noodle soup today. It's really not hard, and if you don't buy all those meat replacers, it's WAY cheaper being a vegan.
FnMH7tREaa	i have been trying to eat healthy, but once every week or two my husband and i take one day and eat whatever we want as a splurge and kind of to reward ourselves. i would DEFINITELY  eat that burger on a splurge day!!!! it sounds ****ING AWESOME. top it with lettuce tomato and maybe have a vat of ranch dressing on the side-YUM!   (since i read this i am already planning my next splurge)|`|Nc6KEYyraa	No, because I don't like bacon.|`|ccr5CWZLaa	Artery clogger!!!!|`|ozWi3TJlaa	I don't worry about calories.  Yes, I'd eat it.  I'd dip it in mayonnaise, too.  I've actually lost 13 pounds just since Christmas.<br>  <br>  Did you know that some ball parks serve double bacon cheeseburgers on a sliced Krispy Kreme doughnut rather than a bun?  Succulent!<br>  <br>  Also, I make homemade corn dogs.  Before I dip them in the batter, I slit open the hot dogs (or better yet, smoked sausages) and fill them with cooked bacon and jalapeno cheddar cheese.|`|ODvnyAdlaa	no i dont eat red meat xx|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	No. That sounds absolutely disgusting.
IcvmE6UCaa	In almost all the italian recipes that require it, the amount of wine needed (be it red or white depending on the dish) ranges from a spoon to a glass. Not much indeed, so the price shouldn't be the main concern.<br>  <br>  My suggestion is: whatever wine you choose, go for a *good* wine, not for a cheap one. The quality (and the success) of a dish depends on the quality of the ingredient you use...<br>  <br>  Oh... forget the Shiraz (or Syrah) someone suggested: it's not an italian wine, it's made in Australia and South Africa. Also forget "Vin du Table" and "Vin du Pays": they are french... :-)|`|igI5yX0vaa	2 buck Chuck from Trader Joe's works for me.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	I think any full-bodied, dry red will work. Chianti is a favorite in Italian cooking.<br>  <br>  You can also try Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc or Shiraz.|`|WGamjAwQaa	use the wines that you drink, and not something cheaper - the taste isnt as good.  i use cabs for tomato sauces, etc. and i've used a malbec to make a red wine reduction for a steak and that was good because of the spicy undertones.|`|2hrLxxlWaa	Any basic red wine works well, you don't need to worry about the quality of a wine when cooking food, only about what is served with the meal. Cheap wines that would do the trick include Vin du Table and Vin du Pays.|`|eAobNmUTaa	I love to cook with a full-bodied Italian house wine...such as a Montepulciano.|`|AA10923010	Always cook with a wine you would drink or serve with the meal you are cooking.

Bake at 350 for 10 to 13 minutes or until light golden brown.  Make sure you let them set for a few minutes before you remove them from cookie sheet they are so tender they will fall apart|`|InvPKVJ7aa	The recipe on the jar of peanut butter doesn't call for any butter.  Try searching some different recipes on line - you shouldn't have to add butter - there is enough fat in the peanut butter itself.
InvPKVJ7aa	Sounds like you're not eating enough...Not eating enough will make your body go into starvation mode and hold on to any little calories it gets.  Eat healthy balanced meals - and excercise.   If you're trying to lose weight, you should eat 5 small, balanced meals per day.  Keeps your metabolism going.     <br>  <br>  As for the macaroni, instead of butter, top with some freshly roasted tomatos and eat a small portion with a fresh salad on the side.   Peanut butter is healthy - it contains a lot of fat, but it's a healthy fat.  Perhaps slice up a fresh apple and dip it into the peanut butter, instead of having it with bread.|`|sDAnuaBYaa	the only healthy diet is balanced. You need whole, unrefined grains, fruits, vegetables, and then proteins (either dairy, meat, or vegetable based protein)<br>  <br>  Peanuts butter sandwiches are healthy, if they are eaten with a varied diet. So it cake.<br>  <br>  If you are asking if they are low fat diet foods, then I guess it all depends on your diet. <br>  <br>  If you've only eaten an orange and some celery you're pretty much starving yourself. Eat a full breakfast, at last 300 calories, so your body has enough energy for the day. Something with protein, like eggs or nuts. Add some fruit and maybe a piece of toast. Don't starve yourself.|`|14929d050f0d4920cb09fe344ab094b9aa	Macoroni is healthy and you have many choices now, like low carb etc. What's not healthy is what you add in it. Better if you prepare yours from the strach. If you decided to eat macoroni and cheese that's allready mixed..eat a salad of fruit first and then macaroni so u are almost full the time u eat it.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	I think you're trying too hard; how old are you?

Plus it gives you calcium for strong bones. I don't really think peanut butter is healthy but try buying the peanut butter with the least grams of fats and try and eat carrots too after your sandwich.|`|LsOfpv8Iaa	Pasta to a small extend it healthy.  If you are speaking of Mac & Cheese, no.  But it sure is good.<br>  <br>  For plain macaroni it's 85 calories for 1/2 cup cooked.  <br>  <br>  For Mac & Cheese it's 374 calories per serving.<br>  <br>  nfd?|`|Yl8JZrataa	Remember, food isn't your enemy.<br>  <br>  Portions are.|`|ef5e7522911c0c07508f67134050536daa	Enriched macaroni is healthy, but it's bland. Butter & salt, nah, the combo is addictive. Try macaroni tossed w/olive oil & some canned or frozen veggies, like corn or broccoli. Sprinkle some herbs & garlic powder on top, also maybe some cayanne pepper (hot pepper flavors reduce cravings. PBJ is a healthy sandwich on whole wheat or rye. And, it stays w/you longer than macaroni, and it has healthy fats, and protein, and...it tastes great! Portion control is the key, if it tastes good you want more. That's why you should sprinkle cayanne on pasta's, reduces the craving for more. Bon appetit!|`|NsTdWhgkaa	sure why not?

An excellent source of protein - essential for stamina - salmon is also loaded with omega 3’s, proven to elevate seratonin levels in the brain and thereby enhance mood. Vitamin rich, this fish has got a great dose of A, D, B and calcium, all known to be necessary for giving the all-important libido lift.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.eatsomethingsexy.com/aphrodisiac/salmon.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.eatsomethingsexy.com/aphrodis...</a><br>  ======================================...<br>  <br>  I love this recipe for salmon, and Pinot Noir goes well with salmon dishes.<br>  <br>      * 2 cloves garlic, minced<br>      * 6 tablespoons light olive oil<br>      * 1 teaspoon dried basil<br>      * 1 teaspoon salt<br>      * 1 teaspoon ground black pepper<br>      * 1 tablespoon lemon juice<br>      * 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped<br>      * 2 (6 ounce) fillets salmon<br>  <br>     1.

Test to see if fish is thoroughly cooked - no longer dark in the center.  Parboil your asparagus, brocolinni or baby zucchini/summer squash.  For all three, melt butter in a skillet, add garlic powder or minced garlic and cook until the fragrance is released.  Add the veggies and toss in the oil to finish the cooking process.  For presentation of the squash, slice it from end to stem but not through the stem so it is still attached at one end.

Chipotle adds a smokey dimension to the chili, enhancing all of the other flavors. If you can't find chipotle powder, Tabasco makes a chipotle pepper sauce that can be used to add some smokey flavor.<br>  <br>  Sometimes I add 1 T. of cocoa powder and a cup of strong coffee. Sounds weird, I know but it really gives a great flavor and enhances everything else.

InvPKVJ7aa	Whip-its!!  It's the same gas you get at the dentist office - It's not completely harmless, but compared to other drugs or inhalents that she could be doing, it's probably the least harmless.|`|Ld5Mooujaa	This is known as doing a "whip-it" and can be very harmful. It's great that your daughter has come to you to talk about this. You should definitely have a conversation with her about the dangers of doing inhalants. Not only can this cause brain damage, it can be fatal.  It's not harmless fun at all.|`|DErBSfZgaa	Are you stupid? ofcourse it's harmful and dangerous.<br>  if it's getting her high it means its harmful to her body. <br>  there have been some cases where kids inhale things like that <br>  and die right after. shes lucky to be alive.|`|c68dd044c16b196244c1cf82d99509a2aa	a read somewhere it eats your brain :-s lol<br>  its just like a deodrant buzz is it know :>:P<br>  Badddd :)) lol|`|w6vGajYjaa	Besides being irritating as hell to find the can of whipped cream without propellant, what she is doing is potentially lethal. When a Dentist administers nitrous oxide, it's mixed with oxygen because straight nitrous can and will kill a person. <br>  <br>  The abuse of inhalants such as nitrous can lead to more dangerous behavior, such as huffing paint or glue. You need to have a frank discussion with her about this.|`|f1SWISQYaa	There was actually an intervention about inhaling cans, it can cause death and is addictive.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzAEnlY9OF4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzAEnlY9O...</a>|`|FVpUi3hbaa	I've never heard of it either!  I've only heard of them stuffing their mouths with the whip cream!  Scarey thought though!|`|LsOfpv8Iaa	That is a good way to die too.<br>  <br>  <br>  nfd?|`|QvrhmdAtaa	Be concerned as this will lead to brain damage and even death. They are called Whippets and ask your daughter if she thinks breathing the fumes from an exhaust pipe is dangerous although in this case it's nitrous oxide. My children's bus drivers used to do a check before school to check for anyone smuggling Whipped Cream Cans on the bus. When a student was found to have 1 in his/her locker also,the police were called and a referral to the juvenile authorities was sent out and the child was suspended from school as well. It's against the law here in Alaska.|`|ece6164651e8c46ee0724690594ca683aa	Yeah, the can has nitrous oxide as a gas for the whipping agent. It's the same gas that a dentist uses. You just don't turn the can upside down. The can gets used upright, and the kids just inhale the laughing gas. Most likely not a good idea.

95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	You can... leave them out. They're certainly not necessary. I personally love olives and parmesan might be important but use what you have or like. <br>  <br>  Olives don't have an obvious substitute; capers maybe or sun-dried tomatoes. <br>  <br>  Cheese is cheese; use what you have but not American. Something grated, preferably freshly grated.|`|EMDNVrcjaa	It kind of depends on the other ingredients, because of the flavors balancing.

j4uTq48Eaa	4 hours|`|suPD7c3gaa	The person probably isn't drunk after 2 drinks. That's not a lot. It also depends on how fast the drinks are consumed. My mom was a tiny little thing and probably had 2 drinks (scotch on the rocks with a little club soda), every night and I never saw her drunk. She worked until she retired, and only drank when she got home from work, except probably the occasional drink if lunching with co-workers or friends.  I doubt she EVER got drunk or even a little buzzed going back to work.  She had way too much class for that.  Even though I wouldn't drink every day, 2 drinks every day isn't over the top or signs of a drinking problem.  Any buzz a person has (assuming you're talking about an adult) would probably be gone in under 2 hours.  If you're talking about a kid (teen), then that's a different story.  He/she could probably even get drunk on 2 drinks, and might take longer than a few hours to sober up.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	An average size drinker that you described with an above-average tolerance would be "sober" after one hour per drink. That is a rule of thumb with alcohol. <br>  <br>  If they only have "a couple drinks" that would lead me to assume they were never even drunk though. <br>  <br>  But lets say that your definition of "a couple" is four drinks. If they drink four drinks in one hour, say between 1pm and 2pm they would be "sober" around 6pm.<br>  <br>  And nap and lots of water would help, as well as food.|`|Wrn6WH7xaa	Maybe a couple of hours... If they eat during this time it should take less.|`|sA8fkTlhaa	I agree with the above answers =]
VtqdeSQ8aa	Tazo is the best of the ones you mentioned.|`|hLohtlPEaa	Some Wal-Mart's are a super center with a grocery store. The Wal-Mart where I live is not.

They don't even carry Bigelow.|`|EmdOb4THaa	Lipton is very average . . . Tazo is good but I don't think they carry a simple black tea (not in my area anyway). The best black tea is Twinings English Breakfast Tea. If you are accustom to Lipton, but want a richer flavor, this is it.<br>  <br>  Lipton is a blend of Orange Pekoe and Pekoe Cut Black tea and Twinings English Breakfast is just Cut Black Tea. I haven't researched what the exact differences are, but I know that I don't like Lipton (and never have, even for iced tea) and love every Twinings tea I have tried (Earl Grey, Lady Grey, Irish Breakfast, regular and decaf English Breakfast). The decaf even tastes as good as the regular, seriously.<br>  <br>  Twinings is inexpensive, too. Over the years, I've tried just about every tea walmart carries and this one of the few that I still buy regularly (I haven't found a green tea, chai, or jasmine tea by twinings or it would likely be the only brand).<br>  <br>  My opinion - Twinings is the best quality, despite the inexpensive price.|`|hKOvKeBYaa	Lipton is probably the best tasting.|`|RRa23mEGaa	lipton
0maJCeLCaa	No.<br>  <br>  But the colour sets an ambiance in a room. Fast food places use colours very strategically, when decorating. F.ex. the colours red, orange and brown are well known to make people feel at ease, relaxed and safe, so they tend to eat more. Colours like blue, white and pale green are associated with cleanliness. So people may eat a little more in a red and orange room, but they will come out of a white-green restaurant, thinking that restaurant was cleaner than the red-orange place. <br>  <br>  In a bar the colour red hides many details in peoples faces (wrinkles and blemishes, f.ex.), and you tend to think people are more beautiful in a red lit room. Hence you may tend to stay longer in a bar, that is lit by red lights ..

sA8fkTlhaa	Well you could try some of these:<br>  <br>  # There is one preventive measure that is absolutely foolproof for every person in the world:<br>  Don't ever drink. You'll be guaranteed to avoid hangovers for the rest of your life.<br>  <br>  # Since 99.9% of the people who are concerned with hangovers will never follow method #1, then the next best preventive measure is this:<br>  Never drink enough to get really drunk. That way, hangovers will be rare, if not nonexistent.<br>  <br>  # Methods #1 & #2 apply to ALL people. From this point on, we enter the mysterious realm of experimental preventives:<br>  The problem here is that all people are not alike in such things as size, weight, metabolism, chemistry, etc. So, what works for me may not work for you. But I offer these as good ideas to try when you've done what 89% of us do - namely, said to hell with methods #1 & #2.<br>  You've just opened your eyes to find yourself crumbled into a collapsed mess, hopefully in a bed, hopefully in somewhat familiar surroundings, but, worst of all, awake. Your mind gradually manages to reconstruct some sort of memory of some portion of the previous night's activities. You feel like the worst part of hell (this is the cue for the proverbial "I'll-never-drink-again" declaration, one of the most pitiful demonstrations of bull$#!+ in all of human behavior). You need help. Quick.<br>  A little understanding of what a hangover actually IS really comes in handy here. It's a combination of a few physiological things:<br>  <br>     1. Dehydration - the alcohol has forced evaporation of a certain vital portion of the body's water.<br>     2. Nervous shock - you're coming off the effects of a mild overdose of a depressant drug, so your nerves are displaying the great Newtonian natural law of action/reaction by going into a relatively hypersensitive state.<br>     3. malnutrition - pumping all that alcohol and liquid through your body has effectively flushed away a significant supply of your storage of vitamins and nutrients, chemicals which would stimulate natural defense systems, but you're running seriously low on them now. <br>  <br>  <br>  What you need to do is take some restorative steps to begin a recovery process. This means doing the same things that you should've done in method #3 (it's really too late now, but it can't hurt). It means rest and as little nervous stimulation as possible. It also means trying to eat something that will help to replace the nutrients you've lost. That really should be in the forms of fruits/vegetables, NOT fatty, greasy junk, not dairy foods, something that isn't too tough on the already beat-up digestive system. Bananas are great for key vitamins. But I'll tell you what I've found to be a real miracle medicine for me - tomatoes!<br>  Strange but true. This came to me by pure accident. I was a suffering bastard one day following a night of revelry, and I knew I needed some food, but I found myself in a situation where I didn't really have any choice about the lunch that I'd been served. It was a basic Italian-American dish that included a tomato sauce (something like lasagne or spaghetti). In less than an hour after eating, I felt rejuvenated, almost back to normal! I couldn't believe how quickly I had gone from hangover hell to basically ok. I figured it was just a fluke. But the next time I was in a similar situation, I deliberately tried it again, and it worked! This sort of explains half of the reason that a Bloody Mary is the standard morning-after drink. (The OTHER half, of course, is that more alcohol - "hair-of-the-dog" - acts to relax your shattered nerves and numb the pain in the head, but more alcohol is also a great step on the road to alcoholism, not a habit I'd suggest.)<br>  So, next time, try it. Maybe a little light pasta with a meatless, greaseless, tomato sauce. Cold gazpacho or a mild salsa may work too, but your stomach will be in no mood for onions and peppers. A glass of V8 may be just the thing. Citrus juices tend to bother the stomach too; but tomatoes are highly acidic, so I can't explain that part.|`|FxAD44Moaa	you've heard of eating and re-hydration?<br>  <br>  <br>  you see..  alcohol dehydrates the system...   thus one must rehydrate to replace the fluids lost in the system.<br>  <br>  :D<br>  <br>  and eating may help, you know.. replacing important elements such as vitamins and minerals?<br>  <br>  <br>  that simple.|`|asAWGIgnaa	how can a hangover hurt your feelings psml. to be honest its a proven fact that sleep is the only thing that completely cures a hangover... but a few tips i have leanrt are.<br>  drink water when you are out, drink a pint of water before you go to bed and when you wake up, when you wake up have a shower and take a walk, and the main one for the next way which totally works is eat fruit.. it helps me loasds, and if none of this doent work try resolve... they help with eadaches an siky stomach. ope ive helpd!!|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Oh no, the hangover hurts your feelings?<br>  <br>  1.

NCZK0QyGaa	Caster Sugar is finely pulverized granulated sugar that dissolves much more quickly than regular granulated sugar, however, it is not as fine as confectioner’s sugar.<br>  <br>  If your recipe calls for superfine sugar for something that is going to be baked, you can substitute regular sugar. If it is clear that the speedy dissolving is important, you’re better off using superfine. <br>  <br>  Domino and other sugar processors package superfine sugar for sale in small boxes, but many grocery stores may not dedicate shelf space for it.|`|53giV6PFaa	Castor sugar is powdered sugar or confectionery sugar.|`|vv2uk9hHaa	It's sugar than it finer than "fine" but coarser than powder...

The exception of course is ground or chop steak which should be cooked thoroughly. <br>  <br>  Of course the USDA doesn't recommend this, just in case, but you can pretty much eat the steak as rare as you want. I would recommend cooking to the point where the interior is at least warm. <br>  <br>  I'd shoot for a minimum temp of 125 degree F for a nice rare steak that isn't too mushy.|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	You can eat it raw and minced as Steak Tartare - check google for a recipe..<br>  With a lump of meat, I usually have the thinner cuts cooked "blue", thicker cuts like fillet I have them rare.<br>  Worms are usually associated with pork - the pig is a secondary host and the worms are encysted in the flesh.

They get a lot of Canadians there and Canadians eat gravy on their fries all the time. I am from Montana, have lots of relative in ND and was just in Bismarck in June.  If it is a really good fry, I like it plain with salt. That said, I love fries with brown gravy. I don't like ketchup. At Wendy's, I don't really like their fries plain, so I dip it in the Frosty and it tastes like the cone part of the ice cream cone.<br>  <br>  A side note: When we were in Holland, when you have fries, they use all kinds of dips for their fries. Their favorite is mayo, but they use a peanut sauce and a curry sauce. So, I think whatever you like is fine.|`|AA10551261	I have never heard of that usually put gravy on mashed potatoes not on french fries.

If "comfort foods" or typical American food isn't a must, protein can be attained from nearly everything-- some significant foods are beans and grains. Beans themselves encompass a ridiculous variety (e.g. white beans, kidney beans, black beans, pinto, lentils, garbanzo beans!, blackeyed peas, etc.. and then prepared diff. ways e.g. baked beans, refried beans, chili beans, or vegetarian chili [which also often includes soy protein etc.])<br>  <br>  One of the best grains is quinoa, abundant in various minerals and nutrients and also unique in that it's a complete protein (contains all 8 amino acids). I consider this a staple and personally keep forgetting to eat it more often! It can be found at health food stores like Trader Joe's or maybe in the ethnic food isle of a more general supermarket.<br>  These are all easy to prepare; quinoa is usually just rinsed and then cooked similar to rice.<br>  <br>  Throw in a good serving of broccoli, spinach, and/or tomatoes or just a fresh mixed salad on the side to ensure you get other essential components aside from protein. For significant added health, switching from white rice to brown makes a giant difference as far as fiber intake and overall quality of protein. Don't forget that too much protein poses health risks along with too little protein (thus more isn't always better)!<br>  Soy/wheat gluten products (fake bacon, soy veggie dogs, fake ground beef etc.) are more accessible than ever these days, though higher in price than actual meats (many consider it worth it due to the health benefits, e.g. zero cholesterol, less fat/sat. fat... etc.). <br>  <br>  If you're on a budget, it's easy to get creative and make your own burgers, meatloafs, etc. by mashing various beans/grains together with a binder to hold the burger patties' shapes, and so on (tons of recipes online!). <br>  <br>  Personally I've been planning to make something fun and fancy like stuffed squash (filling=prepared rice with chopped mushrooms, other veggies aka confetti rice).<br>  <br>  Plain ol tofu is extremely versatile; silken is used to be blended into sauces, dips, puddings/desserts/pie fillings and firm is generally a meat replacer (freezing it before thawing makes it easier to squeeze water out so it will better absorb whatever marinade you want the tofu to take the flavor on of, just as silken tofu will take on the flavor of something sweet, e.g. pumpkin pie filling).<br>  <br>  edit/add: And of course, nuts are part of a well rounded protein intake. They are packed with good fats too; it's a good idea to try to make sure and eat a handful of nuts every day. Like everything else, nuts can also be prepared in different ways, like used in desserts (e.g. chocolate almond clusters; very easy to make). But raw nuts are much more beneficial, health-wise.<br>  <br>  Like I said, the list is endless. I'll stop here though :p

They vary from year to year but when they are good they are very, very good and when they are bad, they are still drinkable.
FjekAwGmaa	Toffee is a confection made by boiling molasses or sugar (creating inverted sugar) along with butter, and occasionally flour. The mixture is heated until its temperature reaches the hard crack stage of 150-160°C (302–310°F). While being prepared, toffee is sometimes mixed with nuts or raisins.<br>  <br>  The process of making toffee involves boiling the ingredients until the mix is stiff enough to be pulled into a shape which holds and has a glossy surface. The resulting mixture will typically be poured into a shallow tray and allowed to cool to form a sweet. Different mixes, processes, and (most importantly) temperatures of toffee making will result in different textures and hardnesses, from soft and often sticky to a hard brittle material.|`|Bx8mNkBpaa	you can do anything you want|`|NsTdWhgkaa	now thats a good question.....hmm i dont know actually O_O|`|o0Badlndaa	yes but it is really time intensive .... needs good cooking skils and is done best where snow is available for the cooling process ....|`|b8e2bc9f3753405233ebcc96825942cdaa	Great women over the years strived to give the world to women,,, Now they've got it, they've lost the ability to make Toffee,,,its a sticky situation,,,lol.
uq8qE6mAaa	It certainly can.<br>  <br>  The caffiene and acids in coffee dehydrate the body.  As a result, you'll have to pee a lot, losing a lot of water.  To make up for the lack of water, the body tries to conserve it wherever possible.  One such place is the tongue.  Essentially, the moist, pink tongue becomes dried out, and it turns white and sometimes kinda cracks in the middle.  Same things happens when you drink a lot of booze too.  <br>  <br>  Drink lots of water/gatorade/etc to rehydrate yourself, and once your body has enough fluids, your tongue will get back to normal.  Dried, white tongue is major indicator of dehydrated (ask any doctor).|`|DT2mU1jOaa	lol What?!|`|IHhDMHrGaa	i don't think so. unless you don't scrape your tongue. what i'm sure is that it could stain your teeth.|`|u4LLFhORaa	i never heard of  coffee turning your tongue white. sorry that's new one on me and i know lots of people who drink 4 or more cups a day and it does nothing to their tongue. maybe dis troy other parts of their body but not the tongue.
MbW8KRoGaa	There is no such thing as vegetarian gelatin--there are alternate products that cause gelling, like agar-agar, cornstarch, potato starch, konnyaku (yam starch,) etc. But the actual product 'gelatin' is derived from sources of collagen found in the bones and tissues of animals.<br>  Whole Foods, or other natural foods retailer should be able to source some vegetarian gelling agents for you. Also, a good Japanese store would be able to find konnyaku for you! It's great stuff with no discernible flavor and it sets up fairly firmly.|`|TJOHxhEUaa	No, there are quite a few decent substitutes, though.

KfaMeCqeaa	The end of 2009 would be,  December 31, 2009.|`|xUfRRGM8aa	It means use it by the end of 2009 if you want it to taste fresh. The previous poster is misleading you with the month after open bit. BBQ sauce like ketchup has a very long "open" life. They are practically shelf stable (which means even if you leave it in your cupboard after opening it should be fine) simply because of the extremely high vinegar content (the acidity keeps it stable) as well as the preservatives.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	It means that you should open and use the sauce by the end of 2009. "Best before" is not expiration, but a recommended freshman date. It means after that date it is safe to eat, but may not taste as fresh. <br>  <br>  Once opened, however, it won't last quite as long. I'd give BBQ sauce about a month in your fridge after opening.
Bhgx0M1Uaa	No to the lettuce but yes to the bananas.  Keep he peels on though.<br>  Don't be alarmed when you see the peel brown the bananas will not be.  I recommend though you only use frozen bananas for cooking and shakes I don't recommend you defrost them and eat as they might be mushy.|`|Lqy9Lc9Oaa	Definatley NO to the lettuce.  But the bananas YES!  You can freeze to make banana bread or you can even eat the banana frozen (almost like a nice ice creamy texture)  I dont think you can put one in a freezer then thaw and eat...might be a bit mushy.|`|2o5lDFbUaa	You sure can freeze bananas! They're delicious, especially when you dip them in chocolate first! Quite nutritious too!

They're great for making banana bread.  I think lettuce will be soggy once it is frozen and thawed.|`|HbQmDGb6aa	No! I've never put a banana in my freezer, but I left one out on my car overnight (I live in NH) and it froze... and turned completely brown. I dunno, maybe it was just the skin that got yucky, but I didn't eat it to find out! It looked nasty. I tried to eat my frozen apple, which was really cold and super mushy. And gross. Don't freeze your fruit! except grapes. Grapes are delicious frozen. :) <br>  I think your lettuce will get wilty|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes!|`|N28zLxtpaa	You can freeze bananas, but they will be mushy when you thaw them out.

4PrLmFUZaa	yes,only just though,do not drown the buggers..|`|BphZi9yDaa	depends on the recipe. most dont actually have to completely cover them but there should be quite a bit of liquid in there since most slow cooker recipes require you to cook for hours.|`|049a5ee66231db2295d9daeba62a36bcaa	just barely covered will work
AA11765580	I love, love, love the Bertolli's shrimp and pasta! There are some good chicken and sausage ones too.

As with all jarred sauces, though, it'd be nice if you could add more garlic and the herbs of your choice when warming it up.  It will make it more palatable.|`|heFbG2FRaa	They sell it in Costco. It's not great, but not bad either. It is very much a convenience food - throw some over frozen meatballs or whatever - so with that in mind you know what you're in for.|`|BphZi9yDaa	their good but def. not as good as homemade or restaurant food. they are very simple tho if you dont have a lot of time to spend cooking, and they are cheaper than eating out.
N53iI8weaa	Yes, I have to agree - I like my meat to be COOKED - not put on the plate as though given a good Vet it would be back on its feet in a couple of days ! ! !|`|fBti22TAaa	Years ago pork was cooked to death because of the liver fluke parasite, which can be passed on to humans.  Nowadays, this parasite is more or less unheard of as farmed pigs are extremely unlikely to get it.<br>  <br>  Nothing better than an inch thick piece of fillet pan-fried for about 3 minutes each side.  It almost eats itself.|`|0Y2HH0FEaa	It's your money, your tastebuds and your choice. If you don't like meat pink, then order it medium-well or cooked through. If any chef refuses to cook a steak or chop how you like it, get up and leave because that's an excellent example of a shoddy restaurant.<br>  <br>  I like mine rare or medium-rare and again, that's my choice - we're not all alike and this is a good thing!|`|35ccc8ce58bda98ad049f1093b5a126aaa	As your tastes mature, you will appreciate lamb, and possibly beef, less well done.|`|7efe32cd91e91cf7ae301fd9dd1b7ebeaa	Pink not red,overcooking spoils taste and makes it tough.|`|KuWLNfYbaa	i agree with you,especially with pork which can be dangerous undercooked|`|93e0b2a4a6386ee080ab833cbe57167eaa	well,what you're talking about is still alive!..i used to hate rare meat till i just closed my eyes and tasted it,it really is good,i always cook my pork well but i like my lamb slightly under done and my steak medium rare...try it,it doesn't have to be completely pink!|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	It's delicious; and how it should be eaten. Lamb, beef and pork get very tough and dry if overcooked. The sure-fire way to prevent this is to cook it so it's not tough throughout. The red juices is not blood at all.<br>  <br>  Beef is very forgiving and is edible after being cooked to a relatively low temperature. I think any chef would recommend medium-rare for beef and lamb steaks for the peak of flavor and juiciness. <br>  <br>  Pork is a little less forgiving, and should be cooked through but not to the point of it being shoe leather. A little pink in pork (unlike chicken) is perfectly safe.|`|T1CuRwm3aa	It's juice, not blood and is better tasting and better for you than if you cook all the goodness out of it.|`|ILpp3ncYaa	It supposedly has more flavor that way, it is gross though.|`|J1kJb98Maa	i have never heard it recommended to eat pork "pink"<br>  can you supply a link please to back that up<br>  thanks so much
FxAD44Moaa	what peanut  butter is on the shelves is fine..  ok?<br>  <br>  <br>  technically it's never ok to eat any processed foods... due to the chemicals, processing and it's overall a inflammatory food which causes problems especially in the digestive system.<br>  <br>  but..    what peanut butter is ON the shelves now is OK...   what has been determined as INFECTED  is no longer available to the consumer.<br>  <br>  (long as the shops are doing their job  with the recalls and removing  items in question let alone items that have been determined as unsafe.)<br>  <br>  <br>  that simple...  you want your peanut butter..   stick with "skippy" for now...  so far  also,  "JIFF"  been in the safe zone since this problem started in the 90s.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	That was never the peanut butter you buy in the grocery store.|`|AA10054771	Well, they never really ruled out peanut butter in a jar, but I'd stay away from it.

VtqdeSQ8aa	Probably not. The FDA has over 10,000 complaints on it and still it is allowed in foods. That really says something about the power lobbyists have in this country.|`|4XM9MAhMaa	? Nutra Sweet is ASPARTAME. Splenda contains NO aspartame whatsoever. Splenda is Sucralose. Two different things, so if you're gonna sue somebody, do your homework.<br>  <br>  If you were reffering to me being an offended diabetic, no I am not, and nor do I drink diet coke. Or regular coke. Anyway, some people are allergic to aspartame/phenylalanine in Nutrasweet. Splenda or Sucralose on the other hand, are different. You can find info at wikipedia.com|`|UDfJQ3i9aa	All I can say is good luck...|`|vv2uk9hHaa	Obviously they can be sued. Any firm can be sued. Your odds of getting anything from it are rather slim though. And you'll probably waste more cash on lawyers than anything. Now, you can't sue the doctors for malpractice because you're not suffering from side-effects from a medical procedure. They can't be sued for what you decide to eat or not. They are only responsible for medical mistakes. This would be the same as suing your doc because you ate a peanut even though you're allergic to peanuts. Doesn't make sense. Either way, this stuff is safe for most people. Like anything else, it won't be suitable for some people while others will have no problem with the product. Besides if you really wanted to sue them, you'd need a hell of a whole lot of evidence of the so called damage done (and your medical tests actually show you're in perfect health, i gather, so you have nothing to bring to court except your testimonial). And, well, in court if it's just your word over theirs... it just won't cut it. Sorry.|`|SkgJYDaCaa	First off, I agree with you that stuff is like poison. But I don't think you can sue them. I'm glad that you made the connection between the two. Now you can go on and live a healthy, normal life. If we were to sue every company that made crappy food, 90% of them would be sued. Onto your doctors, there are many different viewpoints that they have. Not every doctor is same. If you were to go to a Hollistic nutritionist they would have been able to point out the cause in a few minutes but mainstream doctors don't learn the hollistic way of medicine and health. And lastly, the FDA does NOT do studies over a long period of time which means that they are not 100% sure that this is a safe product because they haven't studied it long enough. You'd be surprised at how messed up our food system is in the United States. It seems that they will put anything on the market as long as they can find ways to make it cheaper to make. Look on the back of your bag of chips or soda and read all of the crap that you have no idea what it is... partially hydrogenated this and monosodium glutamate... it's just not healthy for our bodies to eat. Good luck, I'm sorry that you had to go through this. Just beaware of what you're eating and do your own research on things.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Why is that all Sewers including you are so quick to blame everyone but themselves? You would also have to sue the USDA and everyone else who approved the use of aspartame and other sweeteners. What about the millions of people who do use these products and do not have any problems? Get a life.|`|AA11603468	Nutra Sweet is a brand name for aspartame, first of all. And Splenda is a totally different product altogether. I would consult an attorney, but it is highly unlikely you would get someone to take the "case" as you really have not suffered any real damage resulting from drinking these beverages.

zawmsUO1aa	Use coupons! My goal is to save at least 20% each trip<br>  <br>  Familiarize yourself with prices and if you see a good deal, don't just buy one, buy three and build up a little pantry of canned and dry foods. Consider using store brands; most of them have a money back guarantee. Be flexible with your menu - sometimes, seasonal foods are less expensive. Example: fresh asparagus is more expensive in the wintertime. Steer clear of prepackaged convenience foods like Shake & Bake, frozen mac & cheese and Hamburger Helper and make your own for pennies. Spend a rainy Sunday making chili or soup and freeze some in 1 or 2-cup portions for later use; a full freezer runs more efficiently, so you might as well pack it full of food.<br>  <br>  I could go on, but you get the general idea. You don't have to live on ramen noodles to save money on food, it just takes some planning. <br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  <br>  Cheap Chocolate Lava Cake<br>  <br>  I’ve made this a few times in the last 14 years and it always comes out great - the cake rises to the top and the chocolate pudding sinks to the bottom. If you make it in a dish slightly larger than 9 x 9, you get more surface area of chocolatey goodness. <br>  You can add a handful of nuts if nobody in your family has a nut allergy.<br>  <br>  The cool thing?

For meat, be sure to wrap each piece individually in saran wrap, then store in a ziplock bag so you can get as much air out as possible.  This will reduce freezer burn.  Be sure to label & date the bag so you know what it is you have in there.  Also, be sure to discipline yourself to actually use the stuff in your freezer.  Meal planning is a good way to make sure you rotate through your stocks of food.<br>  <br>  Stock up when stuff is on sale.|`|GhZG2LYDaa	Like another poster mentioned - cook from scratch. The prepacked meals are a ripoff and not good for you.<br>  Buy store brands (my exceptions are laundry soap and foil tho)<br>  If you have the room in your regular freezer. Stock up on good buys on meat. Someone mentioned getting a freezer and keeping it in your garage. This might be OK in the winter, but in the summer that thing will be running constantly and your food savings will wind up in your electric bill.<br>  Learn to can food. In many places pressure canners for low acid foods can be rented. Big water bath canners are not that expensive.<br>  Buy bulk if you can of staples like rice and flour.<br>  Buy seasonal vegetables and fruits.

BIoCl9Qqaa	i just add the box of pudding to the cake mix as its mixing.  the flavor of the pudding is there and the softer texture.  i think the milk in pudding is for the liquid and fat content.  in that recipe above, you got the water, butter which has water, and egg.  you got your fat and liquid.<br>  <br>  as to the pudding for a filling, you can whip up heavy cream and fold your pudding into it.  that makes it a faux mousse.   this gives it a heavier texture that you can use and won't run out of the sides of the cake as normal pudding would. <br>  <br>  if you are really daring, dissolve a packet of gelatin, melt it down on the stove with a small amount of cream.  heat it until its all melted  and add that to your cream as it is whipping.  the gelatin will help hold the cream/pudding mixture together so you have a thick layer of filling.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	THe cake mix you chose is already designed to be super moist.

Then, you can gently wedge your knife in between the shell and the meat where the legs used to be. Once you've wedged the knife to expose the flesh, take your fork and re-spear the exposed meat. With the fork remaining in the shrimp, place your knife gently into the tail shell, cutting only the top shell of the tail, where the meat ends. With both the knife and fork in place, pull away from each other. The flesh should pull away, including the hard-to-get-to meat wedged inside the tail.

vv2uk9hHaa	Simply because milk as a very high concentration of proteins and fat, and those take longer to digest than sugar (which is all you have in most other drinks...). So you body tells you "whoa, stop, i'm filled with stuff that will take a while to digest. Don't add anything else." Whereas if you drink juice, it'll be gone from your stomach very very quickly so your body doesn't bother to send that signal saying you're full because it's waiting for you to give it something more substantial. The other reason would be that if you are slightly lactose intolerant, this could cause problems with gas in your stomach which will make it distended as though it was filled with food...|`|AA11603468	I think its the protein.|`|q411DXsFaa	I just got through with a Glass and fill the same way.<br>  <br>   I think cause it is so thick...idk..

Amongst the approximately 50 genera and more than 1000 species of this family, only I. batatas is a crop plant whose large, starchy, sweet tasting tuberous roots are an important root vegetable     The versatile sweet potato is ideal fare for the health - conscious food consumer. With the ever-growing interest in health and natural foods, the sweet potato is quickly finding its place in the family weekly diet the year around. The sweet potato blends with herbs, spices and flavorings producing delicious dishes of all types. From processed baby foods to the main dishes, casseroles, salads, breads and desserts, sweet potatoes add valuable, appetizing nutrients and color to any meal.     As a main dish or prepared as a dessert, the sweet potato is a nutritious and economical food. One baked sweet potato (3 1/2 ounce serving) provides over 8,800 IU of vitamin A or about twice the recommended daily allowance, yet it contains only 141 calories making it valuable for the weight watcher. This nutritious vegetable provides 42 percent of the Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) for vitamin C, 6 percent of the RDA for calcium, 10 percent of the RDA for iron, and 8 percent of the RDA for thiamine for healthy adults. It is low in sodium and is a good source of fiber and other important vitamins and minerals. A complex carbohydrate food source, it provides beta carotene which may be a factor in reducing the risk of certain cancers.    For the most food value, choose sweet potatoes of a deep orange color.    Before cooking sweet potatoes, scrub skin and trim off any bruised or woody portions.    If you are cutting calories, serve a plain sweet potato, cut down on margarine or butter and use skim milk or unsweetened orange juice as liquid when you prepare mashed sweet potatoes.    Remember, it is what you add to the sweet potato that increases calories.  1 small, baked in skin ...............................141 calories  3 1/2 ounces, candied................................1... calories  3 1/2 ounces, canned, syrup pack.........114 calories
llkSmgLJaa	You mean complete protein, all proteins are complex. Soy is a complete veggie protein. For vegetarians who eat eggs and dairy they are complete proteins too. Your body can turn: beans, peas, nuts, seeds, and whole grains into complete proteins too by mixing them. Proteins are the building blocks of life. Houses are built with wood, our bodies are built with protein. <br>  <br>  Get the Vegetarian Starter Kit from - <br>  Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine<br>  <a href="http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/vsk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcrm.org/health/veginfo/vsk/</a><br>  <br>  Vegetarian Nutrition for Teenagers<br>  <a href="http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/teennutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vrg.org/nutrition/teennutriti...</a><br>  <br>  Get yourself a vegetarian cookbook.

Whole grains, beans and legumes, dairy products (since you are vegetarian), meat substitutes (tofu and soy products, veggie burgers, etc), seeds, nuts, and nut butters, and many fruits and vegetables all contain protein.  You may want to consider supplementing some of your dairy intake with fortified non-animal alternatives such as soy, rice, or hemp milk, since dairy products are high in cholesterol and saturated fat.  Just as important as protein, though, are amino acids.  Amino acids are the building blocks of protein.  Our body produces most of them, but some of them we need to get from our food.  These are referred to as Essential Amino Acids.  A food is referred to as a "complete" protein when it contains all of the essential amino acids.  Soybeans, quinoa, and hemp seeds are all examples of complete vegetable proteins.|`|A5gfxSyzaa	You don't need "complex protein" you need to get all the amino acids that make up protein.  You can get these from beans, peas, nuts, whole grains (wheat bread, oatmeal, etc not white bread which has all the good stuff processed out) and vegetables.  It's not something you really need to worry about.  Outside of famine conditions everyone gets enough protein, and most people get too much, which is bad for your kidneys.|`|nJtJvL7Naa	I'm a vegetarian too...good for you! :)<br>  There are meat replacements that are loaded with protein, such as tofu and seitan.<br>  You also get protein from different kinds of beans, nuts, and legumes, as well as whole grains like brown rice.<br>  Protein is what the walls of cells are made from.

I'm 16 & I'm a vegetarian also. Depending on the type of vegetarian you are, you could try fish, eggs, beans, nuts, and seeds.<br>  <br>  Other items that are out there now are types of soy and veggie burgers and protein enhanced drinks. (Like breakfast shakes) These types of food are tasty but should not be eaten on a regular basis because while they have lots of good protein, they have little other nutritional value.<br>  <br>  remember to be careful not to fill up on carbs and to eat your 3+ serving of vegetables a day.<br>  <br>  Also- look for a book called The Vegetarian Bible.

Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.   In a large bowl, combine flour, baking soda and salt. In a separate bowl, cream together butter and brown sugar. Stir in eggs and mashed bananas until well blended. Stir banana mixture into flour mixture; stir just to moisten. Pour batter into prepared loaf pan.   Bake in preheated oven for 60 to 65 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the loaf comes out clean.

AA11341085	The first answerer is quite correct...IF you are using a pressure cooker.  Your question did not mention a pressure cooker, so I have to presume that you are making the soup in a pot atop the stove.    Browning the meat first not only adds flavour, but it seals in the meat juices, so by all means DO brown it first as you usually do.  The reason that it is not tender is that it needs to simmer for much longer than an hour....about 3 should be right.  Simmering it with the onions for that length of time would be great, but again you are quite right that adding the vegetables in the order that you describe is the best way to do it.    Hope you enjoy your soup!  It sounds yummy.|`|KWhKwgsSaa	Your stew meat needs to simmer twice as long as you have been cooking it.

AA10283080	One thing I found that was astonishingly good was garlic chicken.

Mix the flour, bicarbonate of soda and sugar together in a bowl.    2. In a seperate bowl, combine 1 egg with the 50g of melted butter, milk and cottage cheese then add this to the flour mix and stir together to make a batter.    3. Stir in the blueberries.    4. Lightly oil a frying han and heat over a medium heat. Spoon a small ladleful of the pancake batter into the pan and cook for 1 minute on each side, until golden.    5. Repeat until you have used all the batter.    6. Serve with a drizzle of maple syrup, lemon juice and sugar.    ? CupCake ?|`|vcgn6XZgaa	Ingredients    For the pancake mixture:    110g/4oz plain flour, sifted  pinch of salt  2 eggs  200ml/7fl oz milk mixed with 75ml/3fl oz water  50g/2oz butter  To serve:  caster sugar  lemon juice  lemon wedges    Method    Sift the flour and salt into a large mixing bowl with a sieve held high above the bowl so the flour gets a airing. Now make a well in the centre of the flour and break the eggs into it. Then begin whisking the eggs - any sort of whisk or even a fork will do - incorporating any bits of flour from around the edge of the bowl as you do so.    Next gradually add small quantities of the milk and water mixture, still whisking (don't worry about any lumps as they will eventually disappear as you whisk). When all the liquid has been added, use a rubber spatula to scrape any elusive bits of flour from around the edge into the centre, then whisk once more until the batter is smooth, with the consistency of thin cream. Now melt the 50g/2oz of butter in a pan. Spoon 2 tbsp of it into the batter and whisk it in, then pour the rest into a bowl anduse it to lubricate the pan, using a wodge of kitchen paper to smear it round before you make each pancake.    Now get the pan really hot, then turn the heat down to medium and, to start with, do a test pancake to see if you're using the correct amount of batter. I find 2 tbsp is about right for an 18cm/7in pan. It's also helpful if you spoon the batter into a ladle so it can be poured into the hot pan in one go. As soon as the batter hits the hot pan, tip it around from side to side to get the base evenly coated with batter. It should take only half a minute or so to cook; you can lift the edge with a palette knife to see if it's tinged gold as it should be. Flip the pancake over with a pan slice or palette knife - the other side will need a few seconds only - then simply slide it out of the pan onto a plate.  Stack the pancakes as you make them between sheets of greaseproof paper on a plate fitted over simmering water, to keep them warm while you make the rest.    To serve, sprinkle each pancake with freshly squeezed lemon juice and caster sugar, fold in half, then in half again to form triangles, or else simply roll them up. Serve sprinkled with a little more sugar and lemon juice and extra sections of lemon.|`|cErWFPRLaa	I not sure, Check out amazon for cooking books and stuff....|`|d89qNyb6aa	I found you this.  http://www.innovateinfinitely.com/cookin...

Beat the egg well.  Add the milk and melted butter.  2. Mix together the dry ingredients and add all at once to the wet ingredients.  Mix well.  3. Cook on a hot griddle.    Just to give you a little more info on cooking the pancakes:  1. Lightly oil or butter your griddle.  You only need a tiny bit of oil.  2. Heat the griddle before you cook your first pancake.  To test if the griddle is hot enough, drip a drop of water on it.  If the water sizzles, the griddle is ready.  3. Pour 1/4 to 1/2 cup of batter on the griddle per pancake.  1/4 cup will make small pancakes; 1/2 cup will make large ones.  4. Turn pancakes when the top is bubbly and the edges are dry (cooked).  5. Check one pancake to see if it is finished cooking by flipping it over or peeking beneath it.  If you take a pancake out of the pan that isn't quite finished on one side, you can always throw it back in.|`|154ba0db39bdd4b6f69bdaf193725d6faa	buy a pancake mix and add milk cinnamon powder and vanilla extract|`|ToztjpAsaa	The recipe is from Delia Smith, and I find it works very well.  It will make about twenty pancakes, but we're a family of five!    8oz plain flour  pinch of salt  4 eggs  400ml of milk  150ml water    Sift the flour and salt into a large bowl.  Add the eggs and mix until smooth.  Slowly add the milk, beating all the time to ensure there are no lumps.  Finally add the water (not sure why the recipe needs the water, but it works).    Melt about 1-2 oz of butter in a small frying pan and pour it into the batter mixture.    Now begin to make the pancakes by placing the pan on a moderate heat and spooning in approx. four tablespoons of mixture.  Gently swirl the mixture around to coat the bottom of the pan and cook for about two minutes.  The bottom is cooked when it comes away easily from the surface of the pan.    ... and flip!!!    And cook the other side for about a minute.  Stack the cooked pancakes on a dinner plate as you cook them.    When you are finished cooking them, place a large mixing bowl over the top until you need them.  To warm them through, give them a couple of minutes in the microwave.  Yum!

4aYNKp2Xaa	I'm no expert, but my husband used to work in a winery and he would work closely with Rabbis from New York at certain times of the year (I'm in California).  He said he was told once by a Rabbi that the only thing that made a wine kosher was that a Rabbi would oversee the production of the wine.  It was made with the same ingredients as non-kosher wines, although I've read that all wine made in the U.S. could be considered kosher if just ingredients are taken into consideration.  My husband would be the one who did most of the work that went into making the wine.  In the words of the Rabbi, “It means that a Rabbi turned on the switch” of the machinery that was used to process the wine.  I’m not sure if this is how it works in all wineries, but that’s how it was with my husband’s winery.    <br>  <br>  As for why it has to be kosher, I think it's because the wine is used for Jewish holidays and rituals.<br>  <br>  Edit:  One more thing.  The Rabbis would also make sure that the wine tanks were thoroughly cleaned before the wine was put into them.  The water used to clean the tanks had to be at least 120 degrees Fahrenheit.  With non-kosher wines the water temperature doesn't need to be as hot.|`|425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	There are two concerns with kosher regulations for wine. One is the absence of non-kosher animal products like gelatin (used to clarify some wines).<br>  <br>  The other comes out of our history. During the Middle Ages, when Jews were getting kicked around a lot and didn't have any worldly help, the rabbis looked to tighten practices to reduce the possibilities that Torah prohibitions might be accidentally violated. It was magical thinking, but it was the only hope they had.<br>  <br>  Kosher certification for wine came out of that. Jews weren't supposed to touch things that had been offered to other gods, and that was extended to things that might be offered to other gods.<br>  <br>  Nowadays, the main difference is often a more physical 'purity', kosher regulations allow for fewer contaminants than most countries' guidelines.<br>  <br>  Any type of wine can be kosher, as long as it has rabbinical supervision. The advantage of sweet wines is that they don't go off as quickly, so we can fill the kiddush cup each week without having to empty the bottle.|`|AA12090960	As I take it in Judaism most, if not all, things that are consumed need to be kosher. Just as in Islam such things need to be Halaal.<br>  <br>  So wine would need to be kosher for the same reasons as food that needs to be kosher. As a non jew/muslim I can only see that their is some form of either hygiene measures from the good old days or similarly a need to to have known where the item is sourced from to know its safe to consume.<br>  <br>  And in present times wines/alcohol as well as everything else that can be consumed as a food/drink has a lot of stuff that we don't even know about. Like say loads of candy and ice creams are made from whey that comes from animal rennet and I only found out recently and i'm a veggie so I feel quite sick and betrayed that something like a simple item of food is made with consumable parts of an animal and these are items you wouldn't think to check for a V sign.<br>  <br>  I also know most alcohol use measures in its production where animal parts are used in some form or another, which is why, I am guessing, wine would need to kosher.<br>  <br>  Anyway that is my take on it, only a Jewish/Muslim can answer the religious side of it, though I stick to my reasoning above and believe it was incorporated into religion like all other cultural aspects and included into religion (and this goes for all religions).|`|QlQYGlifaa	I have no idea, but I had a glass of Manischewitz (sp?) with a neighbor a few weeks ago and it was SOOO sweet that I threw up! Lol! I was embarrassed :)|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	"Kosher" just means "clean". Think of it the same way you think of the pure food and drug laws, only stricter. Kosher wines have been supervised by a m'shiach during production and are certified as having been produced in compliance with the laws of kashruth. Depending on who does the certification, the label will bear either a "U" or a "K".|`|nstz1Lkeaa	i honestly dont know much about kosher foods but here's a site to help u hopefully<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher_wine" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kosher_wine</a>

HVWAq4u9aa	I use a mixture of lean ground beef with a little crappy ground beef (you need some fat for flavor).  Mix it with minced onions and 1 egg.  Add in some spices (garlic powder, salt and pepper, a little red pepper, and some liquid smoke is great).  Then, when you're forming the patties, make sure the meat stays cold (if it's warm, it messes with the texture because it warms the fat too much).  Make the patties very thin and quite a bit bigger around than you want them to end up.  They will shrink up when cooking and get thicker and smaller in diam.  Cook it in a skillet (unless you're grilling) and if you're going to make more than what fits it the skillet at once, pour most of the grease from the first batch out of the pan before adding the other burgers.  You can also broil them on a broiling pan, but you won't get that seared outside.  However you choose to cook them, be sure not to smush them with the spatula while they're cooking (you'll only be smushing out the juices and flavor) and don't overcook.  Once the juices coming from the top are clear, it's done!|`|IQq0wNqQaa	80/20 ground chuck - 1lb  1/4 of an onion - diced small  1 clove of garlic - minced  2 tbsp parsley - chopped small  2 tbsp worchester sauce  1 tsp salt  1 tsp ground pepper    Mix all the ingredients together. Divide into four patties. Grill or sear in a pan.|`|mTSRtNt1aa	First bake the ham meat to make it tender, not too soft not too hard instead just perfect. For the buns grill them to make them not as crispy but a slight crisp of taste.   Next chop some tomatoes up lettuce and place directly on top of the filling of your burger. Next to release the taste add some sliced cheese on top, maybe one or two slices.  Then once its done to make it look classy add a tooth pick on top with a olive on it to make it look classy and perfect.   Viola! There is your perfect hamburger :)   Eat your burger now wherever suits you best :)|`|V6pE6S7iaa	i like to use ground turkey or ground pork or chicken for a different flavor but beef is fine too    take a onion dice it up and add to the meat one onion is fine   add bbq sauce a bold rich flavor is good or orignal flavor is fine just 2 table spoons is good enough   half a cup of italian bread crumbs  pepper for taste  garlic powder for taste  onion powder for taste  parsley for taste  1 egg  blend well with hands like u would meat loaf then seperate into seperate burgers     and use the george forman grill or a pan with heat oil on low and cook   the grill will be much faster tho    top with provolone cheese or cheddar or american cheese slices and tomato purple or white onion and lettuce and bbq sauce for condiment or none or ketchup ur choice

If you starve yourself, your body will fight you and slow down your metabolism (making weight gain easier). Have a good lunch (no soda or junk food).

If using all purpose flour, then just 10g of baking powder is needed. If using whole wheat flour, use a solid 12g of the baking powder.       Mix the milk, egg, and cooking oil together. Start with 250ml of milk in that mix. Add in the wet ingredients to the dry slowly and stir. If it's too thick, add in a bit more milk. If it's too thin and watery, you've basically gone crepe and add more flour. If you really want to go crepe, then have it thin and toss in another egg.  Use a non-stick pan or use butter to grease a standard pan (my preference as they cook up more golden.) Pour out a small spoonful on a pan and cook that side until the batter starts to bubble. Flip and let it cook to golden brown. Remove and repeat until the batter is gone.

YvNCOYZZaa	There isn't one; it's up to your personal taste.  Just like there isn't a best car, or a best singer.<br>  <br>  Each area has their own special things.  I love the small town feel of Burgundy and the cozy openness of Walla Walla.  The quality of the wines in Napa are something special and the freshness of Mendocino are fantastic.  The old world feel of Italy's wineries is Amazing.  Willamette Valley's events for members have the winemakers available to personally talk with and the wines are world class in this sleepy little country area.  <br>  <br>  If I had to pick on to live near?  Probably Montalcino.  Old World feel, friendliness, fantastic food, amazing views, top quality wines.  My cup of tea all the way!|`|j4uTq48Eaa	Depends on what types of wine you like.

58868fd705c451ae6ba08dde25bd9c7caa	I'd say unless you're adding sugar or some other unhealthy thing, orange juice is good for you. And if you do it yourself, you avoid any of the preservatives or whatever else commercial OJ has. <br>  <br>  Drink up!|`|53giV6PFaa	A healthy diet should include 5 servings of fruit per day.  So fresh squeezed orange juice is a good way of getting this if that is what you like.  About 3/4 cup of 100% fruit juice can count as a serving of fruit.  So keep on drinking it.<br>  <br>  Here are more benefits of fresh squeezed orange juice.  Fresh-squeezed orange juice has many nutritional benefits. The most well-known, primary benefit is that oranges contain excellent portions of vitamin C, a healthful water-soluble antioxidant. Vitamin C combats harmful free radicals in the body, preventing damage, fighting infections and protecting cells that could otherwise be susceptible to diseases, such as colon cancer. This powerful vitamin also increases iron absorption within the body, helping prevent an iron deficiency. According to a recent American Chronicle report, fresh orange juice contains more active, natural enzymes than regular juice. Orange juice has also recently been found to significantly reduce the risk of kidney stones in women. Orange juice is a quality source of dietary fiber, natural sugars, thiamine, folate, potassium, calcium, water and beta-carotene.

Also your own personal metabolism can be a factor. The health benefits of orange juice, far out weigh the possibility of gaining Weight from it.<br>  <br>  Here's a caution though. Any liquid like orange juice is consumed much more easily than say an actual piece of fruit. You can down a big glass of juice without thinking and therefore consume quite a few calories. So keep drinking that OJ, just in moderation.|`|tMdfkVuCaa	Too many calories will make you fat.  Orange juice has many calories for the serving.  I always say I don't want to drink my calories.

KWhKwgsSaa	You can use wonton wrappers for making homemade ravioli -- they are sold in the produce section of many grocery stores.  Following is a recipe using the wonton wrappers, but you could use cheese fillings, meat fillings, sweet fillings -- and for a twist, instead of boiling your ravioli, you can fry it or bake it.    Mushroom and Mascarpone Ravioli  1 tablespoon olive oil  2 large shallots, minced  8 ounces fresh mushrooms, chopped  1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme  2 tablespoons minced garlic  1 tablespoon chopped fresh chives  1 (8 ounce) container mascarpone cheese  salt and pepper to taste  32 (3.5 inch square) wonton wrappers  1 egg, beaten  2 tablespoons milk    1.  Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shallots; cook and stir until starting to brown. Reduce the heat to medium and add the mushrooms, thyme, garlic and chives; continue to cook until the liquid from the mushrooms has evaporated, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool.  2.  In a medium bowl, stir together the mascarpone cheese and mushroom mixture. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside.  3.  Lay out 16 wonton wrappers on a clean surface. Whisk together the egg and milk in a small cup. Brush the egg wash onto the wrappers. Place one tablespoon of the cheese mixture onto the center of each square. Top the cheese with a small spoonful of the mushroom mixture. Place a second wonton wrapper over the top of all the filling and press to seal the edges. You may refrigerate the ravioli on a baking tray covered with plastic wrap.  4.  Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the ravioli one at a time and cook until they float to the top, 3 to 4 minutes.|`|393940f30f6cfc163edbaa3a9238ca9baa	try http://allrecipes.com/Search/Recipes.asp...|`|rSdmxlBNaa	At my shop I sell ravioli for .30 each.|`|NTK4XLuDaa	You need pasta flour.

AA11562326	If you get just about any kind of pine cone, when it's still on the tree and not fully opened, you can crack it open with a hatchet, and there will be brown or black thin-shelled seeds inside.  Crack open those seeds, and the kernel inside is a pine nut.  Most kinds of pine trees have really tiny nuts, so it's not worth it, but a few, like the Pinyon pine, have the big nuts like you would buy in the store.|`|Q8fcepcZaa	pines.|`|EMDNVrcjaa	Pine nuts are the edible seeds of pines (family Pinaceae, genus Pinus).

cfdc405defe60d37e2129e3f90174096aa	I am a former chef and it is a sauce used in Asian cooking to enhance the flavour of many dishes, and to correct the first girl it is not just for oysters, in fact I have never sen it used with oyster, and there is a version made from Mushroom that is vegetarian and neither is fishy tasting oyster are not fishy tasting to begin with.<br>  <br>  You can find both and there available in some grocery stores and most Asian or Chinese grocery's or speciality stores, brands vary but I would not get the large bottle, I use both, and you add it to the cornstarch with a bit of soya sauce when you thicken a stir fry.|`|7AikuG1faa	The sauce will taste more salty than fishy.  Most recipes use it as a flavor enhancer, not the dominant tone of the dish.  Think anchovy paste in Worcestershire sauce.|`|h4OpMJqlaa	the sauce is salty and its not that fishy. ITs just so yumm with vege(thats what i think)|`|MPX0f5jzaa	It's a sauce for oysters, it's not made out of oysters!  LMAO|`|Zt2wk1FJaa	Its a brown sauce containing oyster extract.  It doesn't taste fishy, like the others have said, it's a little on the salty side.  To me, it taste like a flavorful brown sauce.  <br>  <br>  I use it (1 tablespoon) when I make fried rice or stir fry vegetables.  That's where some chinese dishes with brown sauce comes from.<br>  <br>  I also use it when I make steak.  Really really good.<br>  Use salt, pepper and garlic powder on your steak, then smear about 1 heaping teaspoon of oyster sauce on both sides of the steak.<br>  <br>  Place the steak on top of a very hot grill or very hot grill pan.  It really bumps up the flavor of your steak.<br>  <br>  (Here's an example or comparison:  If you like Ceasar dressing, it tastes great because it contains anchovy paste*,  which* brings out the flavor in the dressing, without tasting fishy).

caQqo67Raa	There are two main reasons that home distilleries are illegal in the US. <br>  <br>  First, they are very dangerous. If they are not properly maintained and cared for they can easily explode. The large tanks of high percent alcohol can give off fumes and easily ignite via static electricity or other sources of ignition. Depending on the size of the still, the explosion can easily be lethal.<br>  <br>  The second reason is that it is very easy to make a toxic beverage via "moonshining." This is because during the process of distilling the alcohol into ethyl alcohol (the kind that gets you drunk), other types of alcohol (methyl or wood alcohol, propyl and butyl alcohols) can form in the mixture. These other types of alcohols are dangerous and sometimes lethal to humans. Wood alcohol, or methyl alcohol, can cause blindness and death and is present in some kinds of moonshine. <br>  <br>  If you know what you are doing, distilling could be fun and enjoyable, but there are logical reasons that it is illegal. There are certainly other countries besides the US, like in europe, that have more lax alcohol laws. You could look into that more on the internet.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|aCDWwsisaa	It isn't "illegal", if it was, how would their be Jack Daniels? It is a licensed and controlled activity.  The primary reason it is licensed & controlled is that it is just too easy to make methanol along with the ethanol if you don't know what you are doing, and that makes people go blind and then die when they drink it.|`|ewUQuX4Kaa	2nd poster is spot on... anyone with half a brain knows you were referring to home-distilling, not commercial distilling.<br>  It's a health and safety concern, not a tax concern... there is actually not a very strong "spirits lobby" at all... although the state governments so make a ton of tax dollars on spirits sales as well.|`|AA10758468	New Zealand allows home distillation.

7sA8HwTzaa	It depends on your preference of crust style.  Thick or thin???<br>  <br>  Personally, I prefer the thick, blistered crusts.  They're made that way with shortening slathered all over the dough and the pan.

v6PiR7dJaa	good question :)<br>  well actually it is both good and bad for you<br>  although it's high in fat it does make you feel good inside.<br>  icecream critics are overrAteD. nuttin is good for you. so eat whatever you want but make sure you excercise and also eat foods that are good for you too!|`|GHpcc5iKaa	unfortunately no|`|YQTBQ5xyaa	Not really.  Its high in fat, cholesterol and sugar.  All the good stuff in ice cream outweighs the bad stuff.  The ONLY thing good is the calcium.  However, calcium is found in green leafy vegetables, which is what people should be eating.  <br>  <br>  I would say moderation for ice cream would be tiny amount maybe once a month.<br>  <br>  Did you also know that Vitamin D found in dariy products is an added supplement?  Vitamin D does NOT occur naturally in milk, cheese or cream.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Oh, yes!! It is just as good as eating some eggs and drinking some milk. It is just a bit sweeter is all. But if you keep the portion control it is very good for you.<br>  <br>  Grandmothers recommend sprinkling cereals on the ice cream for breakfast for their grandchildren all the time.<br>  <br>  The fats and sugars in it are necessary for properly functioning muscles and brain.|`|d1372da2f003c93deb4aa8328efee51eaa	it can give you staying power.|`|f5e77b5c7067c9a50f9b069d33657c40aa	Nope|`|C7qkFbPxaa	No people say icecream is because it has milk in it and it gives you calcium, but thats not true, some icecreams don't have lots of calcium in it, they add lots of sugar and creams and candies and etc.|`|uFNV289Waa	If you have it in moderation, its fine!

cDTZ9RgSaa	Broiling is using heat from the top. You probably have a space on the bottom of your oven that is just below, the burner or element.<br>  <br>  The time it takes is all relative to the thickness of the steak. I would cook it for about 7 minutes, then flip it and continue to cook to an internal temperature of 115 degrees for rare.<br>  <br>  However, you would get a much better tasting steak by pan frying it on top of the stove. Broiling or baking isn't hot enough to sear the outside of the meat. Searing the outside stops the moisture from leaving the meat. Moisture is drawn to the heat during cooking, and oven baking or broiling will give you a drier piece of meat.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	I turn the oven temp all the way up. That is the broil setting and was on the old Roper my grandmother had in here and on the old Frigidaire my mother had also.<br>  <br>  Age of the oven has nothing to do with what the manufacturer put on the dial.<br>  <br>  For medium rare I cook 10 minutes then flip the steaks and cook another 10 minutes. For medium I add 5 to the second timeing, and for cremated I put it in for 15 minutes on each side.|`|n20KiADxaa	Broil = 500 degrees. Check only once if you're good, bc the more you open the oven, the more heat you will lose.

You need to have a cool, dry place for them that is safe from predators, whether they be insects, rodents, or children!<br>  <br>  I don't use my laundry room every day and actually have a cupboard where I have room to store stuff like this.  It's too muggy in there if I'm washing clothes.  DO NOT seal them up airtightly in tupperware or the like as they'll become soggy even more quickly than they probably will no matter what you do.  If you can put the baking off til Saturday and the frosting off until Sunday morning, you'd be better off.  Can't you switch some things around???|`|sItCfd7Qaa	The way that has worked out for me is to find room in the fridge and put them in. The only thing is that if they are frosted then they should be covered, but the cover should not touch the frosting because it will remove the frosting.|`|XqfSDTKkaa	I agree that you should have made them tomorrow. but try keeping them in an aritight container or maybe freeze them until youre going to frost them. cupcakes freeze well.|`|jCHxErUwaa	you can bake them today and keep them in a airtight bowl frost them tom. serve them sunday|`|tbzVUKcyaa	air tight container in the fridge. they should keep fine. sounds like fun.
Sk9rNAYUaa	Sounds like you know already.  Just keep an eye because oil sometimes dries up fast with potatoes- they absorb the oil.

Once butter is melted, turn down heat and add potatoes. Cover the pan with lid (or use another pan as lid).<br>  <br>  The steam will cook the potatotes faster, leaving the butter to add flavor rather than burning out and leaving you with yellow raw potatoes lol.<br>  <br>  Once they're soft/tender, add a little bit of bell pepper, onion and tomatoe (if you're feeling up to it, add a jalapeno) scramble in an egg or two and spoon it into a tortilla........

Mix one small or 1/2 large bottle of Catalina Island French salad dressing with one envelope of Lipton's French Onion Soup Mix. At this stage, depending on your preference, you could add to the pan of chicken any of the following: Onions, 1 inch dice, red/green/yellow bell pepper, 1 inch dice, and/or pineapple tidbits. Pour the sauce mix over the whole thing and swirl it around to coat all the pieces. Cover with foil to keep moist.<br>  <br>  Bake in a 375 degree oven until the chicken juices run clear.

mjLQbGUHaa	does for the your mommy know you are playing with ,her computer again ?|`|tbzVUKcyaa	WHAT?
HFb8N0Unaa	Here’s what you’ll need:<br>  <br>  3 cups grape juice (either in a bottle or prepared from concentrate) <br>  1 package powdered pectin <br>  4 cups sugar <br>  glass jars that will hold 1.5 quarts of jelly <br>  (they don’t need to be canning jars…glass jars that used to hold fruit or applesauce, or jelly will work fine) <br>  <br>  1. Combine grape juice and pectin in a saucepan(I stir it with a whisk to get rid of the lumps) and bring to a boil. As an aside, do NOT add the sugar before you bring the pectin to a boil. I’ve done this waaaay too many times, and it causes the jelly to not, well, gel.<br>  <br>  2. After the pectin/juice mixture has come to a boil, stir in the sugar. Bring it back up to a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down, and boil for a full minute.<br>  <br>  3. Remove from the heat. During cooking, some thickened foam will have probably formed on the top of your jelly. I like to skim this off, because it makes the jelly look nicer.<br>  <br>  4. Pour the jelly into your jars and screw the lids on. If you want the jelly to be shelf-stable, you can process the jars in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes. I don’t mess with that usually…I store mine in the fridge, and they keep just fine. And actually, most of the time the heat from the jelly is enough to cause the lids on my canning jars to seal all on their own. <br>  <br>  5. Sometimes, my jelly gels right away, but sometimes it takes a while(like 6-8 hours). So, don’t become distressed if at first it seems that all you have produced is some very sweet grape juice. Be patient, and as long as you’ve followed the recipe properly, your grape juice will have turned into jelly.|`|CLGPzsrcaa	Well, it depends. If you're talking about the spreadable jelly, then just whizz some grapes, add some jam thickener, sugar and water, and boil it down into jam. If you want the jiggly jelly, then use some grape juice and some gelatin leaves and dissolve them both in some hot water. Wait for it to cool, then stick it in the fridge overnight.<br>  Two points please.|`|tbzVUKcyaa	<a href="http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Grape-Jelly/Detail.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://allrecipes.com/Recipe/Grape-Jelly...</a><br>  have fun it sounds nice.|`|ygYXf2Mhaa	spit in a jar.<br>  thats how hill billies make it anyway|`|mjLQbGUHaa	grape juice,sugar ,and fruit pectin,follow the directions on the pectin package ,cant fail ,btw ,you might want to use a jelly thermometer to hit the proper temp.|`|V52z8kEdaa	13 red oranges<br>  2 teaspoon agar agar<br>  400 grams pectin sugar<br>  1 lemon (lemon juice)|`|Cfuy2fHSaa	grapes+blender

Many people believe that your own faeces and more commonly your own urine, is good for you. However this makes absolutely no scientific sense whatsoever. If your body is trying to get rid of material, then you'd do best to follow it. Taking in waste that was meant to be removed is in no way beneficial. Any goodness has already been removed and whatever's left is what the body doesn't want. In fact it could even be harmful, as your body often removes harmful substances through faeces. <br>  <br>  In any case, just how nutritional would it have to be before you'd be tempted to give it a go?|`|ai33g11Maa	Well that's a stupid question - and somewhat paradoxical.

F2ugW4cRaa	No one knows who first created the Pavlova.  But the name, and Pavlova recipes, first began appearing soon after Russian prima ballerina, Anna Pavlova, toured the country in 1926. The dessert was obviously created in her honour. The first known published recipe was in E. Futter 1926 “Home Cookery for New Zealand”.<br>  <br>  By the early 1930's Pavlova recipes were appearing regularly in New Zealand recipe books<br>  According to Volume III (published in 1982) of the supplement to the Oxford English Dictionary to the first published reference to a "Pavlova" was contained in "Davis Dainty Dishes" (sixth edition) published in 1927 by Davis Gelatine New Zealand Ltd.<br>  <br>  (Strangely, yet perhaps typically, the Australians claim they created the Pavlova in 1935).<br>  <br>  Since that time the art of making golden high-rise Pavlovas has been a source of pride for New Zealand housewives. But it has also been a source of frustration for those whose Pavlovas invariably come out flat and dismal looking! Rumours abound about the "secrets" of successful Pavlova making.<br>  <br>  It was nearly fifty years after Pavlovas were created that a commercial manufacturer succeeded in providing them nationally. Cowell’s Genuine Pavlovas are now available from all leading supermarkets. Much to the relief of many cooks and self-caterers! Cowell’s Pavlovas duplicate the traditional high-rise product developed and perfected by New Zealand's housewives.<br>  <br>  Today there are four Cowell’s Genuine Pavlova kitchens operating in New Zealand. The products of these kitchens have extended beyond the traditional to include a range of flavours and sizes to provide for the ever-extending market. This will insure their place in the New Zealand home and catering industry for many years to come.<br>  <br>  As a Kiwi I believe we invented it.|`|TKk20JX5aa	Yum, great dessert!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlova_(food)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlova_(fo...</a>|`|hzGgw4sBaa	Both Australia and New Zealand claim to be the true ‘founders’ of this very famous dessert. <br>  <br>  The Australian version is that Pavlova was invented in 1935 by cake chef Herbert Sachse of The Esplanade Hotel in Perth, Western Australia. It was created in honour of the famous Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova who was visiting Australia at that time. Herbert Sachse wanted a dessert that was light and fluffy, symbolically representative of the ballerina. <br>  <br>  However, that theory is disputed by Professor Helen Leach, a food historian at the University of Otago, who found the exact same Pavlova recipe in a 1929 New Zealand rural magazine. She also found a recipe for a pavlova cake in a New Zealand Rangiora Mothers' Union Cookery Book published in 1933. From her point of view, Pavlova recipes existed in New Zealand before the Australian claim in 1935.|`|ebfe7b0c326a823d4bb72eb16f829606aa	Pavlova is a meringue dessert named after the Russian ballet dancer ánna Pávlova <br>  <br>  Meringue:<br>  1 1/2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br>  1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar OR 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar OR distilled white vinegar<br>  1 1/2 Tbsp cornstarch<br>  1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br>  3/4 cup (6 ounces, about 6) large egg whites, preferably room temperature<br>  Pinch salt<br>  <br>  Topping:<br>  2 pints fresh or frozen berries<br>  1/4 cup sugar<br>  <br>  Whipped Cream for topping<br>  <br>   <br>  Place rack in the middle of the oven and preheat the oven to 275°. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Pour the vanilla and vinegar (if using) into a small cup. Stir the cornstarch into the sugar in a small bowl.<br>  <br>    <br>  In a large bowl of a heavy-duty mixer, fitted with whisk attachment, whip egg whites, cream of tartar (if using) and salt, starting on low, increasing incrementally to medium speed until soft peaks/trails start to become visible, and the egg white bubbles are very small and uniform, approximately 2 to 3 minutes.<br>  <br>  Increase speed to medium-high, slowly and gradually sprinkling in the sugar-cornstarch mixture. A few minutes after these dry ingredients are added, slowly pour in the vanilla and vinegar (if you didn't use cream of tartar.) Increase speed a bit and whip until meringue is glossy, and stiff peaks form when the whisk is lifted, 4 to 5 minutes. <br>  Pipe or spoon the meringue into 8-10 large round mounds that are 3 inches wide on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicon liner. With the back of a spoon, create an indentation in the middle of the mound for holding the filling once meringue is baked.<br>  Place baking sheet in the oven. Reduce oven temperature to 250°F. Bake for 50-60 minutes, or until the meringues are crisp, dry to the touch on the outside, and white -- not tan-colored or cracked. The interiors should have a marshmallow-like consistency. Check on meringues at least once during the baking time. If they appear to be taking on color or cracking, reduce temperature 25 degrees, and turn pan around.<br>  Gently lift from the baking sheet and cool on a wire rack. Will keep in a tightly sealed container at room temperature, or individually wrapped, for up to a week if your house is not humid.<br>  Served topped with your favorite filling - lemon curd, raspberry or blueberry sauce, and freshly whipped cream<br>  <br>  If you want to make a berry sauce, heat a couple pints of fresh or frozen berries in a medium saucepan with about a quarter cup of sugar. Heat on medium heat, stirring once or twice, for about 5 to 10 minutes, depending on how much the berries are falling aprt. Remove from heat and let cool

f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	There can be issues with meringue. Shrinking is a loss of volume during baking that will cause a crackup. Once you start a making whipped egg whites, continue it straight through and finish it off. Don't stop halfway to take a break. After you have finished whipping the egg whites, use them immediately; they'll start deflating in 5 minutes or so. <br>  Meringues include the use of a stabilzer such as cream of tartar, white vinegar or lemon juice. Most recipes will add 1/8-teaspoon of one of these per egg white to the unbeaten eggs. Note: In a copper bowl, the use of cream of tartar is not necessary. <br>  Whip your whites to medium-soft peaks. Beat in 2-tablespoons of white sugar per egg white. Beat until the whites are glossy and hold a firm peak. If you find you have a shrinking problem with your meringue, use a mixture of cornstarch and water. Heat it to form a gel and beat gradually into your meringue. <br>  By varying the amount of sugar in the final mix, you control how hard or soft the final meringue will be.<br>  During heating, the air bubbles expand, causing the volume to expand until the white's protein network surrounding the bubbles solidifies.<br>  Spread meringue over piping hot filling, and spread to the edges to seal. Hot filling is necessary to insure that the inside of the meringue cooks, preventing weeping. <br>  The preferred baking method is one that combines high temperatures with a short baking time. This prevents overcooking the outside and avoids beading and cracking. <br>  Bake at 425-degrees for four to five minutes.<br>  <br>  Make sure your oven is calibrated properly or just to be safe use an oven thermometer wrong temps can rin a lot of good foods.|`|BhFeii5Xaa	Your oven was too hot and they were in there too long at that temp!<br>  <br>  Meringues on pies? they just need until they are gold tipped.<br>  <br>  Meringues like forgotten cookies, macaroons etc? have the oven at 350 F, put the meringues in and turn off the oven and don't peek for 12 hours.|`|6qwN9HCFaa	Lots of freshly whipped cream on them and gobble them up.|`|FU5FQgygaa	make sure you whip them very well and don't leave them in the oven for too long:)

Place the chicken on a cutting board, skin side down, and using your hands, press down hard to make it as flat as possible. Mix together the rosemary leaves, salt, pepper, garlic and 1 tablespoon of the olive oil, and rub this all over the chicken. Tuck some of the mixture under the skin as well. If time permits, cover and marinate in the refrigerator for up to a day (even 20 minutes of marinating boosts the flavor). <br>  2. When you are ready to cook, preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Preheat an ovenproof 12-inch skillet (preferably nonstick) over medium-high heat for about 3 minutes. Press rosemary sprigs, if using, into the skin side of the chicken. Put remaining olive oil in the pan and wait about 30 seconds for it to heat up. <br>  3. Place the chicken in the skillet, skin side down, along with any remaining pieces of rosemary and garlic; weight it with another skillet or with one or two bricks or rocks, wrapped in aluminum foil. The idea is to flatten the chicken by applying weight evenly over its surface. <br>  4. Cook over medium-high to high heat for 5 minutes, then transfer to the oven. Roast for 15 minutes more. Remove from the oven and remove the weights; turn the chicken over (it will now be skin side up) and roast 10 minutes more, or until done (large chickens may take an additional 5 minutes or so).

KWhKwgsSaa	I'm not sure about the elevation, so I have copied and pasted some general info about cake recipe adjustments for high altitude baking.  You have to decrease your leavening agents by certain amounts based on how many feet above sea level -- and liquids must be increased.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/cake_decorating/31903" rel="nofollow">http://www.suite101.com/article.cfm/cake...</a><br>  Adjusting Leavening Agents<br>  <br>  At high elevations, the decreased air pressure causes leavening agents to react too quickly. When a cake rises too fast, no leavening gasses remain when it's cooked, and it becomes coarse and sunken. Decrease the amount of leavening agent to avoid this. At 5,000 ft. decrease baking powder or soda by 15-25%, and by 25% or more at 7,000 ft.<br>  <br>  Adjusting the Volume of Eggs<br>  <br>  The New High Altitude Cookbook says, "One early cookbook recommended the addition of an egg as the only change in converting a sea-level recipe for high altitude. Today, the recommendation is to always use extra-large eggs in all baking. The protein in the eggs strengthens the cell structure and makes up for dryness in the air creating velvety, moist cakes."<br>  <br>  Other Ingredient Adjustments<br>  <br>      * Keep eggs at room temperature prior to use and don't over beat them.<br>      * Increase liquid to compensate for the dryness of flour. Consider using buttermilk or sour cream.<br>      * Increase the amount of flour. 1 tbs up to 5,000 ft, 2 tbs at 6,500 ft and 3 tbs at over 6,500 ft.<br>      * Reduce sugar. Up to 5,000 ft decrease by 1 1/2 - 2 1/2 tbs and over 6,500 ft. decrease by 3 tbs.<br>      * Do not use self-rising flour as it will over-expand.<br>      * Do not over-mix ingredients.<br>      * When using boxed cake mix, do not automatically follow its high altitude directions. Add an egg.<br>  <br>  Changing Oven Temperature<br>  <br>  You may have to increase baking temperature. At 3,500 - 6,500 ft. increase by 15%-25% and 6,500 ft. and over increase by 25%. You may need to do a little experimenting - sometimes oven temperature needs to be slightly decreased for cakes to rise properly and slowly. Invest in an oven thermometer so you know the exact temperature of your oven.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/588879/how_i_learned_about_high_altitude_cooking_pg2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a><br>  Cakes: Until 3000 feet, there frequently isn't an issue with cake recipes. After that, you may need to reduce the amount of baking powder you use. For each teaspoon you'd normally use, reduce the amount by 1/8 tsp at 3,000 feet (after trying your recipe first<br>   to see if this is necesary) and reduce baking powder by up to 1/4 tsp at altitudes between 5,000 and 7,000 feet. Keep in mind why you are doing this: cakes rise more easier at higher altitudes. You simply don't need as much baking powder, depending on the recipe.<br>  <br>  Sugar adjustments: Although I really don't understand why, I do know that I often have to reduce sugar in some recipes. For high altitude cooking, this guideline really does work to make cakes and cookies taste better: for every cup of sugar you'd normally use, reduce that by 1 tablespoon at around 3,000 feet to as much as 3 tablespoons less at even higher altitudes. It does make a difference in the taste of your final product!<br>  <br>  Liquids used in cake recipes: these often need to be increased, helping to keep cakes from rising too quickly and making a difference in the taste and texture of the final product. Again, I'm not sure why it works so well but it can and does. For high altitude baking of cakes, for each cup of liquid you'd use (water, etc), add 1 extra tablespoon of liquid at 3,000 feet, 2-4 tablespoons at 5,000 feet and as much as 4 tablespoons at 7,000 feet. You may need to experiment. Much of the success of high altitude baking comes from trial and error.|`|Cs6oslgpaa	According to the back side of a box of cake mix, you should adjust your cooking time or temperature.

Add the flour mixture, milk and vanilla and mix well. Spread batter into the prepared pans. <br>  Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 25 minutes. Cakes are done when they spring back when lightly touched or when a toothpick inserted near the center comes out clean. Let cool completely then frost, if desired. <br>  <br>  <br>  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^...<br>  <br>  <br>  Warm Flourless Chocolate Cake with Caramel Sauce --<br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  INGREDIENTS <br>  1 cup butter, cubed <br>  8 ounces semisweet chocolate, chopped <br>  1 1/4 cups white sugar <br>  1 cup unsweetened cocoa powder <br>  6 eggs <br>    <br>  1 1/2 cups white sugar <br>  1/4 cup water <br>  1 1/2 teaspoons fresh lemon juice <br>  1 cup heavy cream <br>  2 tablespoons unsalted butter <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  DIRECTIONS<br>  Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter the bottom of a 10 inch springform pan, and line with parchment paper. <br>  Melt the butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Stir in chocolate, and continue to stir until almost melted. Remove from heat, and stir until melted and smooth. In a large bowl, stir together 1 1/4 cups sugar and the cocoa powder. Whisk in the eggs until well blended, then whisk in the chocolate and butter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. <br>  Bake for about 45 minutes in the preheated oven. The cake is ready when the edges have nicely puffed and the surface is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken. Cool cake in the pan over a wire rack. Run a knife around the sides of the pan to loosen the cake, then remove the sides of the pan, and invert onto a serving plate. Remove the parchment paper. <br>  In a heavy saucepan, stir together 1 1/2 cups of sugar, water, and lemon juice. Bring to a boil over medium heat, and cook without stirring until the syrup is a deep amber color. For an accurate color check, dip a metal spoon into the syrup and lift it out of the pan to check the color. Once the syrup is amber, remove from the heat. Gradually stir in the cream. The mixture will bubble vigorously. If lumps form, stir gently over low heat to dissolve them. Stir in 2 tablespoons of butter. <br>  Cut the cake into wedges while warm, and serve with caramel sauce spooned over it. You can also chill the cake and sauce, then warm again before serving.|`|e9c3e42d64ceb58add3e61412e049096aa	Here's one of my favorite recipes:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/Gluten-Free-Chocolate-Cake-224448" rel="nofollow">http://www.recipezaar.com/Gluten-Free-Ch...</a><br>  <br>  It doesn't last very long (doesn't store well), so what I do is cut the cake into single serving sizes, and freeze it.|`|VfuyfhfBaa	I've heard that the bakery Babycakes is very good and gluten-free.

You can mix this with some plain honey (can even try different honeys to change the flavor), usually 2 parts honey to 1-2 parts syrup (depending on honey thickness). Now use that in place of the corn syrup.<br>  <br>  As to the cream of tartar. It's usually used for whipping egg whites. If you whip in a copper bowl, the copper ions will work better than the tartar (but bowls aren't cheap). The copper bowl also makes a great double boiler for melting chocolate for cooking or hot chocolate. Don't ever whip eggs in a plastic bowl, it will never work right. Copper, steel, and glass (in that order).
rsTB7D1zaa	Read your post over again.  You're old enough to understand what you have to do.<br>  <br>  We don't get to know beforehand what we will deal with in life.  <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend obviously has a problem with drinking and isn't stopping it.  We both know that is the only way to get rid of the problem (even then, he is called a "recovering alcoholic" meaning that he can relapse at any time).<br>  <br>  It's absolutely foolish to stay in this relationship.  You deserve better.  You aren't old enough to be settling for the best you can find.  Sounds like what you are doing... the "Great guy EXCEPT for X" where X is some major flaw like alcoholic, pedophile, drug dealer.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	You husband has an alcohol problem; not stopping has nothing to do with you. It's an addiction. He seems to be a functioning alcoholic so, I have to ask, is your problem with the drinking itself or the way he is when he drinks? It is easier to get an alcoholic treatment if what they are doing is affecting their life or people around them. It's harder if he lives a perfectly normal life but simply enjoys a drink now and then. <br>  <br>  Now, I'm not sure why you're asking who discovered alcohol and why... but I think playing the victim won't work unless you're really a victim.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	charlie mops created beer
AA12044809	According to my sources, porridge thick or porridge thin is a matter of preference.  The only thing that is historically documented about the consistency of porridge was in the story 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears' written in 1837 by the poet Robert Southey. You can find that history here. <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks</a><br>  <br>  By the way, thanks in advance for the 10 points.

You could also take fishing line or string and make a mobile laden with precious gems.<br>  <br>  Have a baby night.  You can all dress up like baby dolls and have pacifiers, baby cereal, bottles, etc.  You can watch baby movies like Baby Boom, Look Who's Talking, etc.  Maybe decorate a big box like a crib or playpen.  Have everyone bring a baby doll and get clothes from Goodwill or other thrift stores to play dress up - maybe even just a trip to the store for outfits would be fun.  You can play all sorts of baby shower games.  You can find those free online.<br>  <br>  Have a nerd night.  Watch nerd movies and dress up like a nerd.  <br>  <br>  Work a theme around your favorite music group.  I won't presume to say who, but find a picture that can be put on a birthday cake and get a bunch of fan mags to go through and make a collage or something.<br>  <br>  Take over the kitchen and bake and decorate your own birthday cake.  Supply aprons and chef hats.  Make your own pizzas with mixes or pre-baked crusts and toppings.<br>  <br>  Have a writher's night.  Buy a journal and start writing a story in it.  Then pass it around with each girl adding content until it's finished.  Then publish it online...or not.<br>  <br>  Try a Makeover night where you have a bunch of cheap makeup and hair stuff and make each other look outrageous.  Take pictures.<br>  <br>  Find a place to go horseback riding.<br>  <br>  Ask the girls to dress up like their mothers or grandmothers, then go to a restaurant or someplace embarrassing.  Don't forget funny purses and maybe a couple of you could bring babydolls who require high chairs.  Pretend to speak French to each other.  Harmless fun and you'll giggle about it the rest of your lives.<br>  <br>  Get your favorite board game out and expand upon it.  Play Wii or whatever.  <br>  <br>  Buy white paper parasols and decorate them with paints or markers.  Have Chinese food.

Such as alcohol can not be purchased by a person under the age of 18.  It is up to the seller to determine if the purchaser meets that requirement and the seller may impose their own reasonable methods of achieving this.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that Wetherspoons and M&S were unreasonable in not accepting your passport, which is totally acceptable to the UK Border and Immegration service. I think that a letter of complaint to both these companies is in order. <br>  <br>  I personally have never had any problems in my passport not being accepted for ID in Russia. Good luck to you id you should ever visit us again.

I've been drinking green tea every morning for at least three months, and if anything, my teeth have gotten whiter because I'm drinking less coffee!|`|0uhRgfcsaa	nope.<br>  only darker colored teas would have this problem.|`|TXP8TnNFaa	Nope.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	If people can have green hair these days why not have green teeth, too?
AAgX0SDcaa	Msg is an appetite stimulant, so it is very helpful to eliminate it if you need to lose weight. It is in a lot of products, Pringles, Knorr pasta and sauce mixes, canned soups, beef and chicken bouillion cubes, fajita spices, gravy mixes, many processed mixes like rice or casserole dishes. Another word they use for MSG instead of that is "hydrolized vegetable protein"...so sneaky to do that. It is helpful to start reading food labels before you buy something.|`|VtqdeSQ8aa	Its in a lot of processed snack foods like flavored potatochips, corn chips and snack mixes. Bullion cubes, instant soup packets. Prepackaged meals, especially the frozen ones.|`|bzE5hH8Maa	Kentucky fried ckicken|`|ELIKp5tDaa	fast food, arbys, mcdonalds burger king foods|`|IDBasYahaa	Tomatoes have the highest naturaly occuring ammounts of mono sodium glutemate out of all food. But the levels are very low.<br>  Anything that's high in MSG, has had the MSG added, most products have MSG free options, you just have to read the labels.<br>  <br>  MSG is only a problem if your allergic to it. If your not allergic to MSG, it's no worse than seasoning your food with salt.
uIfbWdsvaa	yea my unlce got it he tlked to the liquor people at the store, bt he knows thm well and they had it in th back but it cost 200 bucks and was imported illegally from europe so u have to knoww the ppl well. for the real absinthe, i drank abot 2 shots nd was really tipsy it was 110 proof, we still have like half the bottle cuz u dont need to drink a lot and u have to mix it with water|`|d74d0d57bf80db1a3f4d675531117d21aa	You can get it at specialty liquor stores like Beverages and More. It is now legal in California since last year. <br>  Absenth is really expensive about $60+ a bottle and doesn't give the psychedelic effect you are searching for-trust me, i was hoping for an acid trip or something and nada. Absenth tastes like black licorice, like the good n plenties candies straight up.  Make sure you atleast chill it before drinking or shake it with ice.<br>  Marilyn Manson makes his own. The really good stuff is made by St. George according to online testimonials, and the factory was sold out almost immediately when it became legal.|`|AA11174096	It's available in Liquor stores in Oregon.  I agree with others here; the stuff from Europe is much better.   But hey, if you have never had it there, you wouldn't even know that now would you?  <br>  It is being made in the U.S. but again, like others have said, it's a bit more lame.  Still good though.  I've got a bottle in my liquor cabinet now in fact.|`|YQod0OB0aa	I dont know how to buy it legally in the US, but you can make it. Be careful though, be very exact with your measurements. Also, it is made with VERY high proof alcohol so dont drink too much of it.|`|MoUtk7cUaa	you're right.  getting shitfaced on 150 proof alcohol that has, basically, poison as it's main ingredient, sounds like fun. i think you should get as much as you can and go to town! yee ha!|`|MiKrWuM6aa	You can by it over seas.|`|wcDy86xuaa	Have to bring it from foreign countries, and it doesn't make you trip, idiot...|`|z3ybCNcfaa	I don't even know what you're talking about.|`|4beOKtogaa	You can get real Absinthe at most bars and liquor stores in Prague.|`|PG7WfGpHaa	Absinthe is manufactured in 3 different strengths of thujone content, these are the '10'mg '35mg' and '100mg' types.  The '10mg' stuff is often derided as a tourist rip off, with a content which is for flavoring only.  The '35mg' stuff is illegal in certain countries, and is said to be distinctive in its effects.  The '100mg' stuff is claimed by its makers to more closely resemble the drink as it was made in the 19th century, but it is only made by one company in the Czech republic, and is remarkably expensive for a bottle of spirits.|`|4a2eee5eefa1d6701c73d4bd94101010aa	I know of at least one liquor store in my town that sells absinthe but it isn't as good as the stuff you can get in France.  The US is afraid people are going to overindulge in the stuff, and too much wormwood can damage you so the US gov't has allowed only a watered-down version to be made and sold here.|`|1YcKHGLqaa	Seeing as it's illegal in most countries (and as you're probably underage), no.|`|OhxDofcRaa	they sell a legal version in local liquor stores, it just uses less wormwood|`|LnoyylQ7aa	internet or europe we have the good stuff which actually has thujone in unlike lucid|`|iVnQ4aCiaa	You can order it on line if you are old enough,.
OmHHC06paa	check on the back under nutritional facts it will either say:<br>  <br>  Serving size 1 bag<br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  <br>  Servings per bag 2 or 3 or whatever...<br>  <br>  the nutritional facts are always based on the serving size...so if its 210 per SERVING and there are 2 servings in one bag, thats 420 calories per bag...<br>  <br>  happy eating!|`|M9o5WpOqaa	serving size, but considering that they are funyuns they are probably very fattening. and where did you find hot funyuns? i've never seen them before, they sound really good.|`|seLkY8VZaa	It's per serving which is usually 1 or 2 servings per bag.
