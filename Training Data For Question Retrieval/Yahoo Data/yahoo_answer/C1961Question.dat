20090222234138AAIie5U	Consumer Electronics;Music & Music Players	Why does my iPod only charge on the computer?	I have a silver 4gb ipod nano video and i haven't had problems with it charging until recently.   Before it would charge if i put it in my speaker dock and if i plugged it into the the wall with a wall charger, but now it only charges if i plug it into the computer.   I have tried different outlets all around my house, and my iPod doesn't charge in any of them.   It's not the dock's problem, because i have tried other people's docks, but my iPod still doesn't charge (and their iPods charge in my dock)   I have also tried my mom's wall charger, which used to work for me, but it no longer does.   Does anyone know why this is or how to fix it?

As stupid as i was, i didn't close the cap tight enough and it spilled all over my stuff including my ipod touch. again, as stupid as i was, panicking,i tried to turn the ipod on a gazillion times to see is if worked, then again i connected it to the computer with no success the screen was all fuzzy. so i just gave up and let the ipod rest for a few days. i connected it to the computer again, the apple screen works and all, but it tells me to restore it and that it's in recovery mode...and when i do, it gives me an error 1611 message and i don't know what to do..i took it to the apple store,they said they cant replace it because of liquid damage.   my q is:   1. will the rice method work with dried up sticky soda inside of it?or even soaking it in alcohol?   2.is there still a chance that my ipod will work in the future, can i easily fix it myself or will i have to take it to a repair shop?   3.last one, what is recovery mode, and error 1611, i looked all over the net, and people have suffered with that error message too when trying to restore their ipod, and it had nothing to do with water damage.    is my ipod finished with, or does it still have potential to survive?again, the apple logo screen works and all, it just doesn't restore...i'm desperate and i want my ipod back!!please help, any advice(other than buying a new one)???

20090222235038AAGSsKk	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;PC	Desperate need of help with the PC?	I've been having problems with my PC for a couple of weeks now. I use ESET Smart Security 3.0.645.0 Business Edition Virus in my computer.Every week i run a check up on viruses.  Last week noticed that i had lots of them installed (perhaps due to a movie I had been downloading). I deleted all of them, but that's when the troubles with the PC started. I have Google Chrome installed, but I use Explorer (an old version) as well, as Goggle Chrome doesn't work with hotmail. After I deleted the viruses, I could no longer open Explorer. My PC would block (freeze) completely. I could no longer check task manager (the PC would not respond at any commands at all). The only way to  turn off the PC was by turning off the main unit (keeping it pressed for a few seconds). Also, I couldn't open C: or D: from My Computer. I googled and found that i had remains of viruses that didn't allow me to do so (Mountain 32). Deleted them, then I did manage to open them, but I can no longer defragment C: or D: I've tried everything that i found on the internet trying regarding the defragmentation of the disk (it still says disk defragmentation could not start). Doing this I gave a command on Command prompt Start > Run > cmd > OK      Then type at the command prompt type (assuming the C: drive):      chkdsk c: /r       Press "Enter"      Answer y to the message "chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another process. Would you like to schedule this volume to be checked the next time the system restarts?"      Exit cmd.exe and restart the computer." Now, every time i restart the PC, after reboot, after showing the Windows logo, it goes to the light blue screen and it says Checking file system on C:, the type of file system is a RAW. I tried redoing the command and pressing N (no) instead of Y (yes). Still the same thing. I could reformat the PC, but the thing is that I have a program installed (work program -  summary of laws) that I really need.    Please, please, any PC Geeks out there, computer technicians that could e-mail-me or MSN me (that would be better if possible) at:   galbaffeg@hotmail.co.uk and help me with this as it really is taking me lots of time, energy and patience.   Thank you in advance!!!

Traded that in for the i-pod video (60gb) and all i got was the data cable, headphones and cd. Now i traded that in for the 80gb i-pod video and all i got was a data cable and headphones. NOT EVEN A CD OR THE FOAM EAR THING FOR THE HEADPHONES!!!!!!!!!!      They made so much money out of us surely the should be giving us silly bits like foam ear pieces! The worst thing is that the new headphones are crap! espeacially without the foam ear pieces. I had to spend ￡25 on some apple in ear headphones.      Very Dissapointed in Apple.

I haven't really tested it, you know, like how far I'm able to detect it and all, but does this happen with anyone else? Does it have to do with wavelengths or frequency or something like that?
