sbhOns9waa	Yes, there are, at least I know of GC and PS2 emulators. epsxe is one that works for PS2, but finding a bios file for it is pretty difficult, I'm still looking for one, if you find one let me know.<br>  <br>  Come to think of it I think there are xbox emulators too, the problem with current generation game emulation is most games use analogue joysticks, which is hard to emulate even if you have a good controller for it, so the only games that really work well are simpler ones like strategy and rpg type games.
zorYTX59aa	You claim that you have "searched" Yahoo! Answers about how<br>  to fix your problem, but I really have doubts about that, because:<br>  -- I am Yahoo!'s overall "Top Answerer" in the YouTube category<br>  -- I've answered over 2,000 questions about slow/stuck YouTube<br>  -- I have a "Best Answers" score usually between 75% and 80%.<br>  <br>  At no time have I ever recommended to somebody that they use<br>  some kind of "speed optimizer". In fact, I always tell people that<br>  they should do the exact opposite and dump all the variations of<br>  "accelerators" immediately, because they conflict with YouTube.<br>  <br>  Out of 2,000 questions, I've maybe come across 2 or 3 answers<br>  where someone else recommended SpeedBitVA. And I've never <br>  ever seen an answer advising someone "clean out" their registry,<br>  unless you're referring to "CCleaner", which isn't the same thing.<br>  Thus I have no idea what "answers" you claim to have searched.<br>  <br>  Do this: exit YouTube, do what's below, then shutdown / reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options → Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now|`|nkydcXf8aa	maybes its just a slow internet connection....mine does that too.....they want u 2 pay more for a faster connection|`|02BmwvQxaa	make your net speed better .
AA10446546	It's not about complexity. Your program is not scalable.<br>  <br>  What if I told you to add a new operator? Exponential, sign change, base change, logarithm, trigonometry function, etc. You'll spend your whole day trying to add one new functionality if you already have 20-30 functions.<br>  <br>  Rather, you should find a way that makes adding a new functionality is just as simple as deciding where to put the button and creating the function that does the function.<br>  <br>  Also, complex expressions doesn't play well with having two textbox. You should try to make it possible to type: 10+30/45*(4-3) and compute them correctly according to the operator precedence rule. This involve making an expression parser.

Try it out.|`|Gq0B47PTaa	I could use one of those routers here. Sounds like you have a router that should be downstairs by the phone jack, upstairs by the laptop. You must log on to your router by typing "192.168.1.1"go here<br>  <a href="http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/111/related/1)" rel="nofollow">http://kb.netgear.com/app/answers/detail...</a> <br>  for netgears how to guide.<br>   Normally the username is admin and password is password. When you log on check your wireless setup, make sure its on and broadcasting and for security make sure you have a ten digit WEP key, save changes. After that,try and find the wireless conection with your  PCMCIA card installed, I usually right click the icon on the system tray and click conect to network. If you dont have a wireless conection on you systray right click network places on your desktop and click properties to get to the network conections page. You should have a wirless connection in their, just right click and choose "view available wireless netwrks" and then double click your modem. when it askes for a WEP key give it the one you supplied in the router setup. one issue with a wireless setup is that you will get up to 54 mbps instead of the normal 100 mbps you get using a ethernet cord.<br>   hope this helps.

793IpAn1aa	Well you need a real video card. I doubt COD4 will run on integrated graphics chipsets, which lack essential hardware features and dedicated memory.<br>  <br>  It's easy to check the minimum requirements for any game at the "Can You Run It" website:<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/referrer/srtest" rel="nofollow">http://www.systemrequirementslab.com/ref...</a><br>  <br>  Just remember that a games MINIMUM requirements just means you'll be able to run the program, not that it will play well.  Usually if you only have the minimum hardware,  games will be laggy and choppy even at low detail settings.<br>  <br>  The lowest card I'd try for Call of Duty 4? Probably a Geforce 9500GT/Radeon 4650 if money is really tight.  <br>  <br>  However, I'd *recommend* at least a Radeon 4670 or GeForce 9600GT. Since many brand-name computers like HP, Acer, Gateway and Dell come with weak power supplies, those low-power consumption cards are excellent choices.

32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	The CPU and video card are the most important system components for maximum gaming performance.  For many games, the video card is more important than the CPU (the more 3D visuals, the more important the video card becomes).  In a typical optimum gaming system, the video card is the most expensive component, followed by the CPU (not including the monitor, which may also be quite expensive).<br>  <br>  Choose a good video card, then choose a good CPU; it might be wise to spend somewhat more on the video card than on the CPU.  You may have to replace the motherboard and memory, too, depending on which CPU you want, and which video card you plan to install.  These four things can fit within 420 dollars.  Other parts don't have to be replaced.  <br>  <br>  The range of prices between the cheapest and the best is enormous, so you should be able to find something that matches your budget.  Your existing disk(s) should be fine (unless they are very small), and you don't need to replace CD/DVD drives or anything like that.  Sound cards are a frill; even on-board audio is usually sufficient for most games.|`|WoSZtf84aa	You will also need a graphics card for gaming. Go with a Core 2 Duo that is faster than 2.0GHZ and the graphics card, 8800 GT. Together you will spend about $300 American dollars.

I would also try and run an antispyware app if you have one installed.

ZVw6Z6xJaa	Mira yo estoy estudiando eso! Y la verdad es algo que te tiene que gustar! Te tiene que gustar programar, pensar mucho para llegar a una solucion o un algoritmo. Porque si no, se te va a ser horrible la carrera. <br>  Como todas las carreras tienen un grado de dificultad, pero puedo decir que esta si tiene un grado alto de dificultad. Y van a haber noches sin dormir, dias en los que quieres agarrar la compu a patadas, otros en los que no queres ni tocarla pero lo mejor tiene un precio. Pero a la vez si te pones a ver hay mucho trabajo para nosotros! Porque la computacion cada dia crece crece y cada dia hay algo nuevo. Por eso es una carrera donde nunca vas a terminar de aprender y de actualizarte, porque si no te vuelves obsoleto. Aunque la gente considera que somos muy metodicos a veces la verdad es que tambien podes explotar tu creatividad y crear algun software util y nuevo. Es una carrera muy completa a mi opinion.<br>  Pero para serte honesto a mi opinion personal es muy bonita, te diria que lo intentes a ver si es lo tuyo. <br>  <br>  te deseo mucha suerte!|`|370a5474005ac3cbe543e2935963f5d2aa	todas las carreras son iguales la diferencia la haces tu si te apasiona algo.<br>  mi hermano es ing en sistemas tiene sus altas y sus bajas como en todas las profesiones. es facil encontrar trabajo pero dificil mantenerse en uno por la alta exigencia que tiene el ing en sitemas.<br>  ahora mi brother es gerente en el depto de sistemas de su empresa y de lo unico que se queja es que no tiene vida social por las exigencias del puesto,y su sueldo llego al tope.<br>  lo mejor es que estudies, trabajes y despues te hagas independiente para no tener que verle la cara a nadie.<br>  por mi parte soy contador publico pero nunca ejercì porque los negocios son lo mio y gano mas que cualquier contador o ing en sistemas.<br>  pero la pasion por hacer algo hace la diferencia.<br>  saludos y suerte.|`|257070287441810e9047bfef7939f0c7aa	PoOS ami la programación no se me da muy bien, creo k se necesita de mucho análisis jojo XD|`|pzVvOVhiaa	Pues yo soy ingeniero en sistemas, es una carrema muy chida si te gustan las matematicas, ya que como es ingenieria, las mates son de ley, y basicamente mucha mucha programacion.<br>  <br>  Cuando sales es facil encontrar trabajo, pues ahorita estan en auje los sistemas, todo el mundo quiere sistemas, por lo que hay mucha oferta de trabajo...

Seeing as your system is 4 years old and if it has never been cleaned inside thats another sign it could be heat related. <br>   <br>      You need to check inside the case for dust buildup on your CPU fan/heatsink and the video card fan/heatsink and clean the dust out very carefully and also check for proper spinning of the fans because after 4 years any of your fans can be worn especially the video card fan since some of them are cheaply made. it it spins very slowly or not at all or if it spins but makes a weird noise you need to replace them or risk frying your hardware.

Some download manager have a setting to send downloaded files to the scanner. For shady files, you should manually scan them though, and if the file passes, don't assume it's free of virus, keep caution, keep an eye on anything suspicious, avoid opening .exe, .reg, and .bat (except if you know what it does and trust the source).|`|H3Cll6Kuaa	This is not possible without unzipping it. As soon as you unzip the file, you must scan them and then if there is a virus detected then you must delete the files and have a full system scan to catch the spreading infection.<br>  <br>  You can also download 1 by 1 file using FDM and then scan them / even scanning the main ZIP file doesn't make sense as the file contents are compressed.<br>  <br>  Example : "abc" compressed as "["<br>  <br>  Above given example proves that scanning the ZIP file is a waste of time !!|`|gDs87Nchaa	Neo is both right and wrong.<br>  <br>  Firefox has good security features, a lot better than internet explorer but you still need an antivirus application on your computer.<br>  <br>  AVG is a popular free antivirus software <a href="http://free.avg.com/" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com/</a><br>  Avast is also popular <a href="http://www.avast.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/</a><br>  <br>  It's also a good thing to get a Firewall if you don't have one.<br>  <br>  With most antivirus you can right click on a file or folder and tell it to scan.

e8b38297d9e56a30610db6c938b6aa2faa	It isn't.|`|HgVLhCr9aa	It integrated into a number of applications as the scripting language VBA.  This is how Excel macros work, for example.<br>  <br>  It's fairly easy to learn.|`|dfjIBHe3aa	It's not what it was.  BASIC began at Dartmouth College as a way to bring computer access to students in the 1960s when there were only mainframes.  It was an extremely simple but powerful -- we would call it scripting language today.  Microsoft BASIC, AKA GW BASIC, was first implemented on the Altair computer and it was not only the best implementation of it when Microcomputers came out (it was three or four years old when IBM released its PC) but it was the only one which went across platforms from CP/M to MS-DOS to the early Mac OS.  And it was simple enough to provide many of us with our first taste of programming.<br>  <br>  When Microsoft Basic became Visual BASIC several things happened.  It stopped being cross-platform for one.  It runs on Windows unless you have an emulator, and even then the programs you create can only run on Windows.  It became considerably more complex and in fact tied into the operating system.  It is in short no longer good for beginners, no longer a scripting language and no longer cross-pllatform.  If you are an intermediate level programmer with a strong interest in the Windows Operating System, then you might find it very helpful, but with computing moving more and more into the cloud some of us are losing whatever interest we ever had in Windows.|`|d98d8bfb68b616f97b22344613a67cebaa	Since its basis is as a language for beginers it is easy to learn, but more importantly it is easier to use.   String manipulation and handling is very easy to use with simple string variables compared to the array handling and manipulation using pointers required in the C language.<br>  Most beginners and casual programmers can handle VB string manipulation vs the complexities of character arrays for string handling which C and Visual C (VC) require.<br>  <br>  <br>  Once a beginner VB programmer learns the fundamentals of array handling the transistion to C is easier. C treats strings as arrays of characters, this  makes the learning curve a little steeper for an absolute beginner. <br>  <br>  VB is used in many programs as the scripting language. (Microsoft Office is the most familiar but other programs use VB scripting as well)<br>  <br>  Most times a program user doesn't care or realize what language the application is written in.  Many times it is up to the programmer to make an application  reliable and easy to use.  However VB in my opinion does have a slight advantage in allowing the programmer to easily make a quality full featured windows form.    It is very easy to add tool tips to controls placed on a form in VB campared to VC. I base this simple observation based on comparing VB program I have written at work to those written in VC by others in which the VC apps are not enabled with any user help . I assume that the reason VC programmers aren't providing tool tips is either it is unavailable or difficult to add the functionality. In VB you just type tool tip text into a property a detail that takes 5 seconds to provide.     Other than that a simple VB form and VC form are identical|`|2SSA9e9Naa	It used to be one of the better because it was one of the few languages <br>  - with context sensitive help, <br>  - tended to guide the programmer, <br>  - less complex to use (although you can do some really funky stuff)<br>  - was the first language with inline completion/guides<br>  - had a huge base of people developing controls for it<br>  <br>  It was a great language for turning things around quickly (still is actually).<br>  <br>  The fact that it was the basis of macro language for all of the Office applications was a real bonus.<br>  <br>  All of that is true today it is just the other languages have started catching up in the aids, online help, etc.<br>  <br>  Oh yeah, for end user, it is slightly less geekish than C/C++ and Java so easier for the non-programmer to pickup.|`|emx3HJSIaa	its easy to use<br>  event oriented <br>  directly interfaced with net framework<br>  low power computing (windows can take control of it, like open a web page inside an applet)<br>  becomes of the simplicity the user gets a stable program<br>  <br>  overall beginner's language

In other words, it is possible for someone to "eavesdrop" on your computer's conversation with the website. If you fill out a form on the website, someone might see the information you send to that site.<br>       This is why you never ever enter your credit card number in an http:// website !<br>       But if the web address begins with https://, that basically means your computer is talking to the website in a secure code that no one can eavesdrop on.<br>      You understand why this is so important, right?<br>       If a website ever asks you to enter your credit card information, you should automatically look to see if the web address begins with https://.

No así en Mac.|`|451dcc741153199a7eefe67029894363aa	Pues la verdad es que si, yo hace pocas semanas pasé un calvario, no se como se me metió un virus y fue una locura, tengo lo ultimo de Panda Antivirus + Firewall 2007 y en pocos dias me lo eliminó, te lo recomiendo porque tu pc estará mas protegido.|`|63ef8ff2ed846247bec7cf2029faa093aa	En realidad no es tan vital ni tan importante tener o no instalado un antivirus. Lo q si son importantes son las acciones q realizamos con la PC. Si no eres un usuario de PC avanzado será necesario q cuentes con un antivirus en tu máquina.<br>  Cómo siempre recomiendo, una de las primeras acciones para empezar a lidiar con los virus del Sistema Operativo más inseguro del mundo, es destildar la opción "Ocultar las extensiones de archivo para tipos de archivos conocidos", en la pesta?a "ver" de las "opciones de carpeta" en "herramientas" del explorer.<br>  ?Porq esto? sencillamente porq la mayoría de los virus traen iconos de archivos inofensivos, como por ej. una imagen. Cuando en realidad es un archivo .bat, .exe o .com, es decir un ejecutable. <br>  Otra de las medidas es no visitar páginas q no estemos seguros, sobre todo las q ofrecen todo, ya sea desde programas populares de manera gratuita, pornografía o similares.<br>  Cuando instalas un programa debes, en primer lugar asegurarte q el mismo no contenga spywares, la mejor forma de verificar esto es googlear el nombre del programa más la palabra "spyware" y siempre descargar el mismo de la página oficial nunca de los sitios de descarga de programas (pero si puedes utilizar estos para conocer la web oficial del programa).<br>  Otras de las medidas es utilizar software libre, porq el mismo es más seguro y de rápida actualización en caso de encontrarse un agujero de seguridad. Para navegar por internet utiliza Mozilla Firefox, en lugar de Internet Explorer. Para manejar el correo electrónico Mozilla Thunderbird en lugar de Outlook.<br>  Yo en particular tengo instalado kaspersky pero no corriendo, solo realizo un exámen mensual y desde hace bastante tiempo q no me veo afectado por ningún virus.<br>  Lo q si es indispensable es un firewall, ya sea en sistemas windows o GNU/Linux.<br>  Pero la mejor medida para evitar y arriesgar inútilmente nuestra máquina y los archivos q contiene es la inteligencia, el 70% de los virus q se difunden por la red son propagados por acciones del usuario y no porq se aprovechen de un agujero de seguridad.|`|95058954475a57c97f8bd592a4a5f250aa	Es muy importante tener un antivirus,porque hay muchisimos virus que pueden arruinar tu computadora.

AA11570675	If it's not in the batch of batteries Dell would agree are defective, you can either live with it or buy a new battery.<br>  Basically, your present battery is shot, but provided you have a power source nearby there's no harm in leaving it in place & just using the computer off the mains. Or it should work off the mains without the battery. If you choose to leave the old battery in, just check every few months that it doesn't leak. If it does, remove it & recycle it or the corrosion will destroy your computer.<br>  If on occasions you need to leave the computer on without mains power, like transferring from one room to another, the battery will still probably have a few seconds life in it. <br>  Some batteries can be encouraged to have a second life. When the computer is switched off, charge it fully. Then unplug & wait for any indicator light to go out. Then plug back into the mains & you should find it takes more charging & the battery may work as well as it used to, just that you have to charge it 2 or 3 times & switch off in between. One caution with this, the low battery warnings won't work so you could find the computer either hibernating or suddenly switching off & losing your work.|`|ULw1777caa	Bad battery.

7m34rQs5aa	nothing can be compressed that low unless you sacrifice quality to image, video, and/or audio. If it's just standard data, use the lightweight 7-zip app. If it's video, you can attempt to compress it with something like dvd shink.<br>  <br>  And btw, cd's are a dying technology, much like floppy disks. You can get a dvd burner these days for like $20 and a 100-pack of decent dvd+r's for around $17. There's really no excuse for using cd's anymore, especially when you have to sacrifice so much quality to make it fit on crappy cd.<br>  <br>  EDIT: compressing already existing mp3 audio files to that low in size means significant audio reduction. Your best bet is to re-encode each track to a lower bit-rate or you can experiment around with advanced LAME settings like using preset-medium or preset ABR and chose lower bit-rate values. You're definitely gonna end up with low-average quality sounding tracks. Use Audacity or CDex.|`|5NU0BvU3aa	I don't think that it's possible<br>  but it usually depends on the file<br>  <br>  and 7zip is the best compressing software<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.7-zip.org/</a><br>  <br>  it's an open source , so you can give it a try anyway|`|FOR5nWG7aa	well u can't but winrar is a good software for the best compression and it also splits file to 700MB as per need.|`|beLSHjWbaa	I think WinUHA can solve your problem, i'v seen the games compressed with couple hundreds megabites, but after compression I got couple gigabites; it might take you half a day to compress and also it depends from what kind of file you tryind to compress.

Theres only one stumbling block, and we'll get to that later. All the files we need to edit are in the /etc directory. The kernel your using needs to support ppp - if you installed the one that came with Red Hat, theres no need to worry, but if your using a non compliant one, your going to have to recompile.<br>  <br>  The first file we're going to edit is /etc/resolv.conf - the resolv in the name shows us that if we put in, lets say www.linux.ie, that it'll resolve it to its real name 123.123.123.123. In windows, youd call what your putting in here the DNS server addresses. The first line should say 'search', and then on a separate line for each other DNS server, you should put 'nameserver 123.123.123.123', or whatever address you are using is. Write that file, and thats step one out of the way.<br>  <br>  Now cd to the /etc/ppp directory, and have a look at whats there (ls). The ones we're interested in are the chatfile, and the options file. The chatfile is a script where our computer chats to your isps computer and they exchange your user data, such as your password and your usename. We'll come to that in a minute, the first one were going to edit is the options file.<br>  <br>  This is how my options file looks :<br>  /dev/modem<br>  57600<br>  modem<br>  crtscts<br>  lock<br>  connect "/usr/sbin/chat -vf /etc/ppp/chatfile"<br>  defaultroute<br>  name username<br>  noipdefault<br>  <br>  The line above dont mean anything too complicated : The first tells the OS where to look for the modem, the second the speed of the connection (Real or desired), the third tells us its a modem connection (It could be an ISDN), I havent a clue what the fourth does, nor am I interested, the fifth locks the modem so that no other communictions application can use it when your online (A good idea), defaultroute tells the OS to use the DNS nameservers we set up in /etc/resolv.conf, name is where you specify your isp login name - here Ive used username, and the noipdefailut means that your server allocated you a new IP address each time you log in.<br>  <br>  The only thing you should need to change here is the name line. The next thing we need to edit is the chatfile, and this will vary for *every* isp online. If you know of someone online using Linux and you have the same IP, ask them for their one. If not try and search for a sample one. If your're based in Ireland, www.linux.ie has chatfiles for all the Irish ISP's on the main page.<br>  <br>  Heres what my chatfile looks like :<br>  ABORT BUSY<br>  ABORT 'NO CARRIER'<br>  REPORT CARRIER<br>  REPORT CONNECT<br>  '' ATDT1234567890<br>  name : username<br>  word : password<br>  chf ppp<br>  <br>  The chatfile works like this, the first few lines start with ABORT and have a term after them. If the monitoring application (chat) picks up any of the terms after your modem has dialled, then it gives up. In most cases if the line is busy, theres no dialtone, or your modem cant connect, the ABORT signal is sent, and the pppd (The ppp (Internet) daemon (controller)) is killed. The next line is usually atz, this resets the modem and prepares it for a call. The REPORT lines aren't necessary, but theyre a good idea if you wish to examine the log file for the connection at a later date. In my case, Ive asked the computer to note in the log file when my modem either detects a carrier, or when it connects. The next line is interesting. The first two '' get the attention of the modem, at the ATDT command is followed by the number of the ISP I use. Up until here, everyone's chatfile is the same.<br>  <br>  In my chatfile, I have three more lines. My computer waits to see the line 'name :', when it sees that it sends username (Or your username), then it waits for 'word :', an abbreviation of password, and sends my password (Or yours), the next line is specific to my ISP, I need to tell my ISP that Im using a ppp connection, so when my isp gives me the 'chf :' prompt, I say ppp, and the connection is established.<br>  <br>  For the last few lines of the chatfile, your going to have to talk patiently with your ISP. At the mere mention of Linux most will simply say "Sorry, Linux doesnt work with our servers". Remember that most people on Tech Support are sitting there with a book of Questions and Answers, and Linux just isnt in there. Talk nicely, explain that what you need is needed in Windows too, and then maybe you'll get some answers.<br>  <br>  When you've all that done, type pppd, and you should connect. The way to check is using this command - 'tail /var/log/messages', that log file shows you the responses we asked the chatfile to note earlier.<br>  <br>  Please dont eMail me asking for chatfiles for specific ISP's, I dont have them.
AA10645979	As others have said it here, yes it is possible for someone to crack your password. <br>  <br>  That being said, you are not totally helpless in this matter also. <br>  <br>  You can certainly take some steps to guard your password such as:<br>  <br>  Use numbers, symbols and letters (upper case mixed with lower case) in your password and keep it secure as also change it pretty often. <br>  <br>  The length of your password also matters as shorter passwords are easier to crack.<br>  <br>  Here is an article on the subject of password protection that you might find useful:<br>  <a href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Can-Somebody-Crack-Your-Password?&id=1778810" rel="nofollow">http://ezinearticles.com/?Can-Somebody-C...</a>|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Yes it is possible  Unfortunately they are located on individual sites, and not your harddrive!  Each of these has there own protection and security set up and they are fairly secure.  Trouble is when you access them to look at your information you create a link that then can be intercepted by various hackers and the like. Bit like intercepting a telephone conversation using the telephone cables (or wireless these days).  Given the technology, ability and need or desire a hacker can then find what they need to infiltrate your information. Like a burglar breaking in and finding your safe with the combination taped to the side of the safe!!!!  No there is not much you can do if you do get taken. There are large numbers of people who have their identity stolen by these means.|`|Dn8i9sIlaa	Change all of your passwords, preferably to something very long and random, including letters and numbers, and write it down on paper, to keep it safe.

AA10867564	by definition: netbooks are laptops that do not have optical (dvd or cd) drives.<br>  <br>  my research:<br>  1. netbooks generally cost $350 or less, but adding a portable dvd will cost around as much as the cheapest laptops that already have a dvd.<br>  <br>  2. batteries make a huge difference. in general, batteries come in 3 cell, 6 cell, 9 cell, 12 cell, or higher versions. a netbook will run about 2.5-3 hours on a 3 cell battery, while a laptop will need a 6 cell battery for the same length of time. as a general rule, every 3 cells in a battery costs about $50. for a 6 cell battery, a netbook will run for about 6-10 hours. <br>  <br>  3. weight: on average, netbooks will weigh about 2.5 pounds. Laptops generally cost more the lighter they are. A laptop that weighs under 5 pounds will cost over $1500. If weight is important to you, netbooks are the way to go, at a loss of functionality.<br>  <br>  4. Processors: in general, netbooks use single core processors, which is only an issue if you are running Vista. Vista has issues with single core processors. A related issue is that some cheapo laptops are running single core processors. Usually, a regular laptop with a single core processor is more expensive than a netbook with an aftermarket external DVD drive (see #6).<br>  <br>  5. Similarities: in general, netbooks and laptops both feature similar things like an integrated 10 key keypad, hd size, sound cards, ethernet adaptor, RAM, etc. Don't be fooled by such things as an additional 1 gig RAM or 20-40 gig hd space. <br>  <br>  6. DVD reader/writer: By definition, "netbooks" do not have an optical drive. However, it's not as simple as adding an external DVD to your netbook. There are two types of DVD's: portable and non-portable. Portable DVD's get power from the USB port. Other DVD's require an AC adaptor. Currently, the cheapest portable DVD i've found is an $85 generic from Best Buy. Consider that cost before committing to a netbook.<br>  <br>  7. Brand: Some brands have terrible reputations: eMachines, Gateway, Acer, etc. Others have good reputations: Sony, Panasonic, Lenovo/IBM, Apple, etc. As a general rule, if you find two equivalent machines, one from a "good" company, and one from a "bad" company, the computer from the "bad" company should be less than 50% of the cost of the "good" computer to justify the risk.<br>  <br>  In summary, if your major concern is portability, a netbook will be the solution you are looking for. If  you are willing to pay more for the features you really need, "high end" laptops are the way to go. My recommendation would be a Panasonic Toughbook. However, if you just want a powerful computer that does everything and you don't want to do research, get a macbook...but you'll pay a lot more for similar features.|`|C0M20I9Raa	Hi, steven,<br>  <br>  In general, laptop are faster, more powerful and bigger. The bigger screen and keyboard make it more comfortable to use. The negative side would be heavier.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, netbook is much lighter and smaller. This makes it very convenient to be carry around. But this also means that it is less comfortable to use because of the small screen and compact keyboard layout. Netbook is less powerful than laptop, but it is more than enough to be used for Micorsoft Words and surfing the web. In fact, I have used one to run multi-media tools.<br>  <br>  Netbook is usually cheaper than laptop.<br>  <br>  If I do not or seldom carry the computer around, I would choose a laptop. But if it comes to mobility, I would choose a Netbook, because of the light weight.<br>  <br>  For this, I leave you to judge based on your usage. I also recommend you to visit the shops and have a feel before purchasing, especially on a Netbook. Personally, I find the netbook is too compact for me.<br>  <br>  I hope this is the answer you are looking.|`|837xgMwLaa	Laptop every time, as long as it's half decent.

Windows XP Home or Linux Lite are common, though there are simple ways to install more advanced OSs if you're okay miss out on a few features.<br>  <br>  Laptop are for people who need portability, but a wider range of hardware choices suitable for their needs. They come in a range of hardware configurations, from fairly powerful to desktop replacements. OS wise pretty much anything you can have on a desktop these days really.|`|7k4jS3Ziaa	well i have a laptop<br>  <br>  netbooks are smaller in size have windows xp and are cheaper by about ￡100-￡200.<br>  <br>  hope it helped|`|ddf97263e4bac13f02a3db67a26b8d53aa	laptop

RAID 0 makes reading and writing to the disk faster, and RAID 1 essentially creates a backup (everything is saved exactly the same onto 2 separate disks, but only reads from one).<br>  <br>  I've ran some benchmarks, and my 2 hard drives in raid 0 perform 90% of the speed of the velociraptor. Since it's much cheaper to buy two 7200 drives rather than one 15,000 drive, I would without a doubt say get two 7200 drives.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  I take that back. I just ran a benchmark and mine perform about 10% quicker than the velociraptors, and they're only 10,000rpm. 111MB/sec|`|837xgMwLaa	Just wanted to add, I think the smaller the hard drives are, the faster they will perform.|`|1mbO4UYiaa	2 drives will always be faster than 1<br>  <br>  However, the best combination would be to use:-<br>  <br>  2 x 7200rpm RAID-1 (for HD content - READ MODE)<br>  1 x 10000rpm Velociraptor (for writing out the HD final edited content)<br>  <br>  The more disk spindles you have - the better the performance, and with HD content being large sparse files; it is ideal to have this sort of configuration.

A better solution is to install DVD codecs so that any media player can play them.  A good one is the K-Lite Mega Codec Pack, it also contains other useful codecs like DIVX, XVID, mp4 and various others that you'll find that you haven't got.

GxXpvNIwaa	If your computer always restart, There are some reason:<br>  I. It's Hot in There<br>  Sometimes this can be caused by an overheating situation. Itunes, RealPlayer, Windows Media player,etc. require a lot of processing power to decompress and decode music files, which can cause the processor or hard drive to get hot.<br>  Memory Fails Me...<br>  If you determine that overheating is not the problem, the most likely suspect is bad memory.<br>  II. Don't Do Me Any Favors<br>  There's a setting buried in Windows XP that tells your computer to restart when a system error occurs. you turn off that option, you may solve your automatic reboot problem. <br>  1) Click Start, then open Control Panel<br>  2) Click Performance and Maintenance<br>  3) Click System <br>  4) Click on the Advanced Tab<br>  5) Click Settings in the Startup and Recovery section<br>  6) Uncheck Automatically Restart in the System failure section <br>  Note that this may prevent the system from restarting, but it can also mask the true problem.<br>  The most common cause of computer restarting is a corrupt registry. <br>  Most likely your registry is bloated and overstuffed with an assortment of useless pieces of data. The operating system while running your computer has to pick its way through all this excess material. There will be bits of programs which were not completely uninstalled, parts of programs which were never completely installed, fragments of miscellaneous data, useless drivers, and a multitude of other bits and pieces.<br>  The answer is to clean your registry and remove all the material which is not needed.<br>  <a href="http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Center.htm" rel="nofollow">http://toptenantispyware.com/Clean_Up_Ce...</a><br>  Get the best one, and completely clean your windows registry with a few clicks of the mouse.<br>  <br>  III. Computer Restarts After Download?<br>  <br>  This can also be a virus or spyware problem. I suggest you go through your Control Panel / Add or Remove Programs list and remove any programs you don't need, then run thorough anti-virus and anti-spyware scans.

If so you're after 'tcp/ip'. This controls how packets of information are passed from one machine to another (handshakes, packet size, checking of whether the information has arrived successfully etc).<br>  <br>  The alternative is the way that people use the internet. This is commonly called 'netiquette', and it is a set of guidelines on how people should communicate on the web.  Simple things like 'not typing in capitals cos that is the same as shouting' are part of netiquette.<br>  <br>  You can find loads of netiquette guides via your favourite search engine.

81pm9Ckoaa	You just need to get a host which has unlimited domains hosting.<br>  <br>  I recommend one of these: <a href="http://www.hosttell.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hosttell.com/</a><br>  <br>  Powweb has the best offer right now. It's on a 50% sale - $3.88/month ($46.56/year), and you get a free domain from them.<br>  <br>  P.S. Since you didn't use this option earlier here's how to set it up. You just need to add your existing domains in your Powweb control panel, set the path to them and create subfolders for each one in your root folder. You don't have to transfer your existing domains. You just need to enter your new host's nameservers in your domains control panel. For example if you've registered your domains with Godaddy, log in to your Godaddy account and enter NS1.powweb.com and NS2.powweb.com for your new nameservers. They will connect to your hosting account and will be totally separate websites. (after you enter the new nameservers it might take up to 24 hours for DNS records to propagate, but usually it doesn't even take an hour). Now, whenever you want to add a new website (something.com):<br>  1. just register a domain name (wherever you want)<br>  2. enter: NS1.powweb.com and NS2.powweb.com as nameservers<br>  3. add the domain name in your hosting control panel<br>  4. and create the subfolder (with the same name) like something.com (you can name it anything you want, but it's easier to manage them if you name it the same as your domain)|`|FCFdYuchaa	confirm<br>  <a href="http://verycheap-webhosting.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://verycheap-webhosting.blogspot.com...</a>|`|eNw0LKtHaa	If you have Linux based server (Apache), it is possible with virtual hosting.

hwiu7TCYaa	No programming is required, the best method, and generally accepted, is to use CSS. That way you only have to define the source for the image once.<br>  <br>  Using PHP would be ineffective due to the extra server resources required, and JavaScript would be considered a bad-practice.<br>  <br>  <br>  I.e.<br>  -----StartCode-----<br>  td {<br>   background: url("tick.gif") no-repeat top left;<br>  }<br>  -----CodeEnd-----<br>  <br>  You would then need to remove the background on following cells, which can be done like below.<br>  <br>  -----StartCode-----<br>  td + td {<br>   background: none;<br>  }<br>  -----CodeEnd-----<br>  <br>  You could also use the first-child pseudo-class, and that way avoid having to reset the style for following elements.<br>  <br>  -----StartCode-----<br>  tr > td:first-child { background: url("tick.gif") no-repeat top left; }<br>  -----CodeEnd-----<br>  <br>  But the first-child pseudo-class might not work in older browsers, i however recommend that you use the last option, because older browsers should not be supported, to discourage their use.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	The only way the browser is going to insert the image is if there's an <img tag.

TDgJH2Bwaa	That card will not work! If you have a 400 watt power supply i would suggest the geforce 6800 gt. I can easily play Call of Duty 4 and bunch others on medium/high settings. Infact i was just playing online last night, and this card is only about $50. Remember though, this isn't the newest agp on the market, but since most agp motherboards are quite old you don't want to buy a extremely good graphics card or it will just blow up your motherboard (literally). So thats why i would suggest getting the 6800 GT. It has great graphics (almost as good as a xbox 360) with a very playable framerate. I would suggest though having at least 2gbs of ram ( two pairs of 1gbs so you take advantage of the dual capability) because most games require 1gb but by having 2gb the game will run faster.|`|JxxZpxqmaa	You likely have a motherboard with an AGP slot.

zorYTX59aa	Contrary to popular myth, you don't "get paid" by just being a YouTube partner.<br>  First, you need an "AdSense" account, and, believe it or not, most partners do<br>  not have one. But even if you did, only in exceptional circumstances, if Google <br>  places "certain" advertisements by your videos, do you "sometimes" get a few <br>  pennies based on 1000s of views, or (more importantly) if people actually click <br>  on the ads beside your videos. Another influential factor is your "channel views". <br>  Do people just watch a couple of your videos, or do they go to your channel to<br>  watch "YOU"? That's why channel views are so important. Just like regular TV, <br>  advertisers pay the networks for their target audience and demographics. They <br>  don't pay the TV show, nor individual episodes. After all, media buyers can not <br>  possibly know the exact content of the next video a partner may come up with.<br>  <br>  It's not that easy becoming a YouTube "partner". Almost all of them are either<br>  a film / video creator or producer, an artist (musician, singer, comedian, actor),<br>  a media company, an advertiser, a broadcaster, a person of great significance <br>  (like President Barack Obama) or somebody with a special project or mission <br>  (like Shawn Ahmed and his Uncultured Project for the children of Bangladesh).<br>  <a href="http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject" rel="nofollow">http://youtube.com/UnculturedProject</a><br>  <br>  But that is not enough to become a "partner". YouTube has even more criteria:<br>  -- You create your own original videos (meaning videos nobody else has done)<br>  -- The content is 100% yours (there aren't any elements that belong to others)<br>  -- You own all of the implied copyrights<br>  -- Your videos are viewed by thousands<br>  -- You upload videos on a regular basis<br>  -- The videos are suitable for all viewers<br>  -- You are a resident in one of the 19 countries where YouTube has local sites<br>  -- You can prove you are 18+ years old.<br>  <br>  Generally, YouTube will not consider you unless you've got some combination <br>  of "subscribers" and "videos" that when multiplied together can easily surpass<br>  10,000 channel views. Thus, you would need, for example, something like 800 <br>  subscribers and 20 videos or maybe 500 subs and 30 vids -- as well as a total <br>  view count close to the 1,000,000 mark.<br>  <br>  I hope you find all my information helpful.|`|Yu7vBUkOaa	The whole point in becoming a partner is to get a share in the ad revenue. I doubt it is set up to let you not take the money.|`|2ZahQeYZaa	You must have thousands of views to even qualify for the partner system. If you do qualify, the main reason for becoming a partner is to get income off your videos. I'm not sure why you would want to be a full partner if you get thousands of views already and don't want to get paid. Generally, you would not get paid that much from youtube unless you have more than 20,000 subscribers. Hope this helps.

AA11314954	What you are doing is not an error. The compiler will compile and use that value. However, your number is outside the *precision* of float. Floats, in most common C and C++ platforms, are 32 bits long. After accounting for 1 sign bit and 8 exponent bits, you are left with 23 bits for the fraction (effectively 24 bits with the implied 1).<br>  <br>  24 bits is about 7 decimal digits. Your constant has 9 significant digits. The last two digits are effectively ignored. If you need more precision, use the double type.

48f495e3bdaf92f8f08e2d21903199beaa	Really you need a patent attorney to help you.

pXzvu866aa	1. Your line-by-line idea with getline( ) won't work for a binary file.<br>  <br>  2. You initially showed what you're searching for in double quotes, so I'll assume it's an ASCII string you're looking for. You'll need to find the following sequence of bytes (hex): 32 35 35 2E 32 35 35 2E 32 35 35 2E 32 35 35. Read the file byte-by-byte, and try to match the pattern. If/when you do find that sequence, you'll write out the new IP address starting at the location you found the first '2'. Rather than trying to overwrite the original file, it's probably easier to create a new file with the altered sequence of bytes. You should be able to do it in one pass, and you won't need to read the entire file into memory. Maybe just a buffer of 15 bytes, a sliding window that you move through your input file, would do the trick.

6b20b31ca0cc72763d8a38403afd5bcbaa	I wouldnt worry. If they have a high positive feedback score. Read some of the feedback and see what others thought. The feedback means alot to sellers. It is the way you judge them, its their reputation. I sell on ebay and my reputation means alot to me. Most sellers will bend over backwards to please the customer, more so than buying from a regular retailer. just be patient , it will turn out well.|`|1rcnc56Waa	Wait a few days, maybe he is busy, has his own life and all. An many other customers too.|`|1pK1Sd0Gaa	Don't worry now yet.  Did you received message from paypal shipping notification?  If seller not using paypal shipping, ask him for tracking# and approximate ship dates.  Wait for week and if you don't get the item, contact seller again.  If you paid through paypal, they have buyer protection and you can file a claim if you didn't receive item but you have to wait 2 week or so to be able to file it.  You can go to the "won" page on your account summary, on the right hand side, click the down arrow said "leave feed back", choose "resolve problem". Follow the direction. Good luck!   P.s. If you need his address, just go to my ebay page, click on advance search next to search bar, on your left, you should see "find contact info".|`|npkLIKPUaa	100% is good<br>  He is most likely busy<br>  I had a girl that a bought from go on vacation and had to wait until she got back to ship me the item.<br>  Plus if you use paypal, paypal will give you the money back since you didnt get the item,or so I heard.<br>  Just wait a couple of more days and if he doesnt respond send a complaint on ebay.|`|Um9rR3PUaa	allot of power sellers have so many emails to respond you will be ok i have bought many items no problems if you have a problem ebay has help lines to fight for You it will be ok|`|QKRCZuMYaa	e bay is generaly very well controlled and most sellers are good people.

IGJGUfjNaa	There a several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.<br>  <br>  2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how. <br>  <br>  3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.   <br>  <br>  4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.<br>  Check your drivers. <br>  <br>  5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/fix-computer-freezes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...</a>|`|tfuPCVzOaa	It's over heating due to dirt in the airways.

2SSA9e9Naa	Welcome to the MS Blue Screen of Death (BSOD). Basically that error is saying the system received an interrupt that it doesn't know how to process.<br>  <br>  Potential resolutions:<br>  1) Go to the website for your computer manufacturer and download the latest drivers for your sound card<br>  2) See if there is a patch for SIMS2<br>  3) Check the sims2 forums to see if others have solved the problem.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	You have a device driver bug.  In games, this usually means a problem with the video driver, although, if the blue screen mentions an audio driver, you should suspect that first.<br>  <br>  Try to update the audio driver for your computer and see if the problem goes away.  The game itself is unlikely to be the problem, since user applications cannot cause blue screens on their own. (This assumes that you are running Windows XP—earlier versions of Windows are far less stable.)

For example, extending the application to support your phone number format, or allow entry of employee id's, etc.<br>  2) Can save you work - for example, if you export data to create a custom report in Excel or Crystal reports. If you customize the software to create the report then you save the extra steps.<br>  <br>  Disadvantages:<br>  1) It costs money to make the change, often significant.<br>  2) The change may not be compatible with the next release.<br>  3) Companies will often charge you to port it to a new release.<br>  4) Introduces risk - the change make add bugs to the software which have to get fixed and may not be found until the product is rolled out.<br>  <br>  Does that help?

99d982daf0c2b0d82a4675478155a500aa	Learning skills vary from person to person.<br>  A good start would be to get a Bachelor's degree in computer science.  The university degree will take you through the knowledge you need to begin your career as a developer.<br>  <br>  There are so many possible things for you to learn that it would be difficult to tell you "this one resource".  Clearly, Sun is a great resource.  However, I often find I get stuck on a topic and I'll do a search for a tutorial on that item and find other resources.<br>  <br>  In all honesty, you need to learn about the following concepts:<br>  Object-Oriented Design<br>  Unit Testing (Test-Driven Development is preferred, but any form of Unit testing would be extremely beneficial)<br>  Design Patterns (Just the original Gang-Of-Four)<br>  Software Development Life cycles<br>  Software Engineering<br>  Databases and SQL programming<br>  <br>  Depending on where your career goes you need to learn other things as well.<br>  <br>  A computer Science degree will help you with the basic items I listed.  <br>  Beyond that, find mentors that are willing to help you.<br>  And do specific research on topics that interest you, whether it be gaming concepts or artificial intelligence.  Take the time to know what you will be doing in JAVA?  If you want game programming, then there may be a need for a JAVA developer but not as likely as a C/C++ developer.<br>  <br>  Every language has benefits.

MxculX2Daa	If you report it NOW you will just have your benefit for that week recalculated and you will have to repay any money you were overpaid in that week. If they ask why you didn't tell them earlier just say you thought you had but must have overlooked it and you now want to get it all straight. There will be zero problems from this. If you are on benefit now then they will take back a part of the amount owed every week until it is paid off.<br>  <br>  It is always far better to report it late than to not report at all - and then get found out. If they find out later (which is perfectly possible) then you will have an "interview under caution" about it which will go on your criminal record. Its unlikely that anything would happen beyond that - apart from still having to pay the money back that you were overpaid in that week. However it would still count as benefit fraud.<br>  <br>  The benefits agencies often discover things like this due to a thing called "data matching". This where a gov computer compares a list of people on benefit to a list of people who were working/paying NI or Tax. If your name comes up on BOTH lists then bingo! You're caught out. They do that all the time with all kinds of data lists.<br>  <br>  If you have any rent or council tax paid through your benefits then you should also tell the local council "housing benefit" department and ask them to give you benefit taking into account your earnings for that week.

I am not sure why you are looking at Verizon as you do not say or what the price is.I would look round at other ISP providers as there are some excellent deals to be had on broadband packages. If you want a telephone and broadband deal there are some really good deals. For example Talktalk (now owned by AOL) their telephone and broadband package is ￡21 a month and this included telephone line rental, free telephone calls to any 01 number (anytime) free calls to 21 other countries free and up to free 8MB Broadband. This is just one example, I would do some reasearch on the internet to find a package that suits you.|`|99d982daf0c2b0d82a4675478155a500aa	Verizon will provide you with your high-speed access.  they won't provide you with the typical ISP features such as email.<br>  <br>  So if you want to stay with AOL for email or use something else?<br>  <br>  I don't know why you are leaving AOL but if things haven't changed much, and I doubt they have, you have ot use their software to check your email.

More often the DEP (Data Exclusion Prevention) settings in Vista are blocking the program from running (Vista extra security).<br>  You can set the games files to be allowed by Vista DEP by using the<br>  sysdm.cpl command (type into the run box, and select the 'Advance' Tab and click on 'Performance settings' and click the 'Data Exclusion Prevention' tab and add the games files onto the DEP exception and click the 'Turn on DEP for all programs and services except those  select' check button.<br>  Then apply and ok.<br>  <br>  If you use the two setting options as above you will be able to get around 90% of old games working on Vista.<br>  Ive got old games working on Vista that I was told would not work. But not quite all of them.<br>  <br>  I use the sysdm.cpl command for a lot of programs, as it gets many programs working in Vista.|`|BBnnSwK9aa	Try them and see.<br>  <br>  The incompatible ones will be PAINFULLY obvious.<br>  <br>  HINT:  If the game's website doesn't say it can run on Vista, it probably won't!|`|535082b26bf8dfc8eb1987117dec57f5aa	You may have problems.<br>  <br>  The main difference between vista and the older versions of windows are permissions.  That is software has to ask windows to ask you to let it do anything that may be suspicious - even if its harmless.<br>  <br>  Older games have no concept of permissions, it doesn't know how to ask so this causes problems.  If you right click and then click "run as administrator" then it will automatically give all permissions.<br>  <br>  If its an older older game that uses dos, then download a program called "dos box"|`|AA12271834	It really depends on a couple of things, first how old the game is (the older it is the less likely it is going to work), second how closely the programmers programmed the game to the Windows standards (ie use of Direct X) (the closer to the standards the more likely it will work).  If you have a game that worked on Windows 2000 but is not working properly on Vista it may be a DOS emulation problem (most pre Win2K programs were DOS based and post Win 2K systems have only partial DOS emulation).  I would suggest installing DOSbox.  DOSbox is a 1:1 implementation of MSDOS and as such will play all DOS based games.|`|dOMzkQIraa	Not all old software will work properly. If one does give problems you can try right-clicking on the icon, choose properties. There's a tab with compatibility settings that could help..

If you do change your swap file space to zero Windows will have to rely on RAM purely, and if/when it runs out of RAM it'll crash or throw up messages telling you you are out of memory.<br>  If you are set on that course go to Windows Help and enter Swap Files or Paging or Virtual Memory and follow the instructions.|`|dILqe7nBaa	windows 7 is the same as vista and faster and since vista has sp1 it has less problems than xp as long as it came in a new computer not an upgrade

pUzJiMUcaa	There is no such thing as "uncopyrighted" music in America, first off. Even if a copyright is not registered, it exists, and a fair use agreement is in place when you get the music.<br>  <br>  Either way...a music review site can get you in trouble if you are playing songs on it. I would just do the reviewing, and avoid posting the songs. The RIAA is all about bullying people lately..just ask any of the thousands of YouTube members who had their vids muted or removed last month because of WMG's nasty tactics...or you can ask the people in Ireland why they can no longer access any site that the music industry deems "hazardous to their business".<br>  <br>  Oh, and the Limewire turbo/pro....just so you know, that does not give you ANY freedom from copyright law. You STILL are illegally downloading music from the site, even if you pay for limewire. All you are buying is access to a service. You still need to stay within the limits of the law if you want to avoid being targeted by the bullies at the RIAA.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	There's NO ISSUE.<br>  <br>  uncopyrighted music can be FREELY DISTRIBUTED BY ANYONE.|`|chHPoiThaa	Dunno but look at these.<br>  As an alternative you can download music for free from this site that are in the format of MP3's, the only issue with them is that they are in rar files and need to be extracted with winrar software.<br>  You can get winrar software from here.<a href="http://www.download.com/WinRAR/3000-2250..." rel="nofollow">http://www.download.com/WinRAR/3000-2250...</a> or here <a href="http://www.freedownloadscenter.com/Utili..." rel="nofollow">http://www.freedownloadscenter.com/Utili...</a>           <a href="http://www.sinlesslinks.com/Music/hits-of-80s--ultimate-collection/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sinlesslinks.com/Music/hits-o...</a>       Free music you can get from here <a href="http://www.allyoulike.com/?p=5702" rel="nofollow">http://www.allyoulike.com/?p=5702</a> <a href="http://www.rslinks.org/movies/They" rel="nofollow">http://www.rslinks.org/movies/They</a> refer you to rapid-share.com and as a free user you can only down load every 15 mins.|`|vDSRgHxDaa	There is no issue uploading uncopyrighted music.

0wUwKbHsaa	Generally the way you upload your HTML and related documents to a web site host is by using FTP.  FTP allows you to batch transfer files from a client to server.  Web site hosts run an FTP server.  You need an FTP client.  One FTP client that you can use and which is free is called FileZilla.  Often your web site host provides a method for you to FTP files as well.<br>  <br>  Your web site host will provide an address for you to access the FTP server and will give you a username and password.  You can then simply upload the files by selecting the files you want to upload and to what destination.|`|ZmZEhBOoaa	Use an FTP program.

ww6nm7gfaa	The answer is year = 513436<br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  How do we determine this?<br>  Let us create an equation to help solve this.<br>  <br>  395425559298 = year + year*year + year*(year+1)/2<br>  <br>  Now, where did this formula come from? Well, we know we want add to be equal to that big number, so we find the value of add. It is initialized to year, so that is where the first year comes from. Look at the for loop, we have year iterations. Remember that addition is commutative, so we can separate out the additions of the i's from the additions of the years. Now, there are year loops, so for each of these loops, we are adding year. That gives us our year*year. And the last part is we are adding i, but i increases by 1 each time. This is a simple summation. sum of i, from i=0 to i = year. This is a common sum, whose value is equal to year(year+1)/2. Wikipedia summation notation for more on this.<br>  <br>  So, that is where we get the initial equation. Now we just have to solve for year.<br>  <br>  395425559298 = year + year*year + year*(year+1)/2<br>  <br>  395425559298 = year + year*year + year*year/2 + year/2<br>  <br>  395425559298 = year*3/2 + year*year*3/2<br>  <br>  263617039532 = year + year*year<br>  <br>  At this point, we're thinking "quadratic formula" so we rewrite it like this:<br>  <br>  0 = year*year + year - 263617039532<br>  <br>  year = (-1 + sqrt( 1 - 4*(- 263617039532)))/2<br>  <br>  year = (-1 + sqrt(1054468158129) )/2<br>  <br>  year = (-1 + 1026873)/2<br>  <br>  year = 1026872/2<br>  <br>  year = 513436<br>  <br>  And thus it is solved :)|`|9NIqMKojaa	Project and programming help-<a href="http://javahelper.info/" rel="nofollow">http://javahelper.info/</a>|`|Qm2apU5Qaa	I think you can answer that with math dealing with summations you might want to ask a watered down version in the math forum.|`|99d982daf0c2b0d82a4675478155a500aa	More appropriately, can you share with us the problem that lead you  to this code?<br>  <br>  Your for loop is adding the year plus an increment to the year everytime... so you are getting:<br>  <br>  add = (2009 + 1) + (2009+2) + (2009+3) + ... + (2009 + 2009)<br>  <br>  where each item in the () is an iteration of your for loop.

If you do not have transfer paper setting on your printer you will have to manually flip the image to rotate it backwards before printing.

If you are going to be doing extreme video/photo/music editing and need a quad- or eight-core CPU w/ more than 4 GB of RAM then the Mac Pro is the way to go. The Mac Pro will blow the MacBook PRo out of the water any day, but the MacBook Pro has portability. I have a MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro, all with their advantages and disadvantages. If you are buying something for editing or gaming and dont need all that power i would suggest an iMac w/ the 3.06 GHz CPU, 4 GB of RAM, and the nVidia 8800 video card.<br>  <br>  As far as wi-fi, the macbook pro and imac have it out of the box, the mac pro has it only as an option when you buy it.|`|2dfe934de75466e2025a3ff73a25cbfeaa	MacBOOK Pro is SO much better.

KNppmXiXaa	As the Michael M suggested, return that video card.  The 9500 GT is not a gaming card (no matter what BestBuy says).  NVIDIA GeForce card performance levels are indicated by the last 3 digits and the first digit represents the "family".  So the 9000 family of NVIDIA cards is the latest.  Unfortunately the gaming cards start at the x600 GT level.  BestBuy misled you to purchase the 9500 GT, which is at best a multimedia card.  Even the 9600 GS is not very good for gaming.  Your better bet (if you are looking to stay in budget) is to pick up an 8600 GT (which will easily beat a 9500 GT) or a 9600 GT.<br>  <br>  As for the memory, if you have the slots, leaving the existing 512MB of RAM generally won't hurt.  If the memory you have and the memory you purchased are different speeds, you may want to consider pulling the 512MB (if this is the slower memory).  2.5GB of RAM should be adequate for gaming on XP so I don't believe you are having a memory issue.<br>  <br>  ** Edit **<br>  You should have no problems returning the video card.  You stated to the employee what you needed and they recommended a product.  If that product doesn't meet the needs, they are in error.  The store promotes itself as having IT experts so they recommended a card that can't meet your needs (forget the exact business law for this but they are at fault here).<br>  <br>  ** Edit 2 **<br>  Try pulling the 512 MB of RAM and see if the 2GB shows up.  If the system doesn't boot with the 2GB in and the 512MB out, the 2GB of RAM may not be compatible.  You can mix speeds of memory at times, but all memory needs to be compatible with the motherboard and it will run at the speed of the slowest RAM.  The easy test is to try with just the 2GB though and see if it works.|`|ce1cb786eea06a723de252998d40455baa	Have you checked your computer for spyware or adware or malware?<br>  <br>  A good anti-virus package or all in one program should be able to detect if you have anything on there that is slowing it down.

YOu can have a fast everything else on the computer, but if the chipset is not designed to handle those higher speeds, you are gang hog tied.  I hate to say it, but 18 year olds at Best Buy don't know what is what.  Best Buy has a tendency to hire teenagers who don't know much about what they are selling. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry about your purchasing experience, but my opinion is, you just have an old chipset that cannot render the graphics you want and by the way, an old processor will do the same thing, so it could be either one of them.  It was a good guess to upgrade to those two new things, but you see, everything depends on how well things are communicated on the computer.

Windows Mail supports the following e?mail server types.<br>  ? <br>  <br>  Post Office Protocol 3 (POP3) servers hold incoming e?mail messages until you check your e?mail, at which point they're transferred to your computer.

IMAP is commonly used for business e?mail accounts.<br>  ? <br>  <br>  Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) servers handle the sending of your e?mail messages to the Internet.

The compiler will compile and use that value.  However, your number is outside the *precision* of float.  Floats, in most common C and C++ platforms, are 32 bits long.   After accounting for 1 sign bit and 8 exponent bits, you are left with 23 bits for the fraction (effectively 24 bits with the implied 1).<br>  <br>  24 bits is about 7 decimal digits.  Your constant has 9 significant digits.  The last two digits are effectively ignored.  If you need more precision, use the double type.  It is 64 bits long with 53 effective bits of fraction - about 16 decimal digits.|`|895a9c5a15e6d6d3abafddf9e56a915aaa	if that is the only line of code you have <br>  ex<br>  <br>  #include <iostream><br>  <br>  int main(int argc, char* argv[])<br>  {<br>  float i;<br>  i = 0.159854218<br>  <br>  return 0;<br>  }<br>  <br>  and you get a floating point error, then your missing the semi-colon, but normally that will return a syntax error not the floating point error.<br>  now if you a doing something like<br>  <br>  printf("%d",i);   <br>  try using<br>  printf("%f",i);<br>  <br>  since there isn't enough info I'm only guessing at what you are trying to do.<br>  Hope this helps

g6easyBFaa	XP Pro Tablet Edition is a special version of XP.  It contains all the TPC functionality which does not come with standard XP installations.<br>  <br>  And XP TE is only OEM.  You cannot buy it.  Luckily, most TabletPC manufacturers will send you the required Restore Disks for XP TE if you call them, give them your TPC model# and serial#, etc.  The cost is usually pretty small.  I got a set of disks from HP for an old TC1000 TPC some years back for about $10.<br>  <br>  Or if the machine is good enough, you can install Vista.  All but the Basic versions of Vista have the TabletPC components integrated into the OS, and they self-activate when they are installed on a TPC.

7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	CGI (common gateway interface) means that a program (an "external application") has to run on the web server to do what the link is supposed to do.  It's not running.  Why?  Someone screwed up the code on the page.  Email the webmaster (at the very worst, try webmaster@gpo.gov if there's no other contact link) giving the exact URL (from Firefox's address bar) and the text surrounding the link, so he can find it.  It might take a while before it's fixed (webmasters usually have a lot on their plates).|`|dOMzkQIraa	Somebody needs to fix the link on that site. File:// is not a valid internet link, it's referring to a local file.|`|LClG91ZDaa	The getdoc.cgi file is could be something that runs on the government server, and not on your mac. Try just clicking the link instead of trying to downoad the link itself -- it is possibly it's not mac compliant, but you'd think it would just be a pdf file or something. good luck
SkpRC2Nmaa	Shawn worked summers in Hull at John Fanning?s Internet company, Chess.net, often sleeping on the couch. "I was just getting into programming, so I spent a lot of my time just fiddling with projects and hanging out." While there fiddling, Shawn Fanning spent months writing the code for napster a program that could provide an easy way to download music.<br>  <br>  After graduating from Harwich High School in 1998, Shawn enrolled at Boston's Northeastern University. Shawn rarely attended class and spent Christmas break working at the Hull chess.net office with his uncle John pushing himself to get the napster system completed. The system was launched in Early 1999. Later he appeared on the cover of Wired magazine and rose to fame. Soon after, however, Napster was the target of several music industry-backed lawsuits, which ultimately ended up causing the cessation of the service. Best Buy purchased Napster in a line of succession from companies such as Roxio, and Sony-BMG.<br>  <br>  Shawn worked summers as an intern in the Chess.net division at his uncle John Fanning's internet company, NetGames, in the nearby town of Hull. There, Shawn became quite deft at programming from fellow interns who were studying computer science at Carnegie Mellon University.[2]<br>  <br>  In 2003, Fanning opened a new company, Snocap, along with Jordan Mendelson and Ron Conway. The company aims to be a legitimate marketplace for digital media. That same year Fanning had a cameo appearance, playing himself, in the film The Italian Job (2003)[3]. In the film, Seth Green's character accused Fanning of stealing Napster from him while he was taking a nap. In December 2006, Fanning developed Rupture, a social networking tool designed to handle the task of publishing gamers' individual profiles to a communal space and facilitating communication between World of Warcraft players.<br>  <br>  As of 2008[4] SNOCAP has been acquired by imeem. Rupture was later acquired by Electronic Arts for a reported $30 million.<br>  <br>  In the spring of 2008, Fanning appeared in a Volkswagen commercial directed by Roman Coppola, in which he poked fun at his illegal file-sharing past.[5]<br>  <br>  He is currently dating professional poker player "Jennicide".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Fanning" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Fanni...</a>

AA12393023	In Simple English:<br>  <br>  Web Service - A service hosted on the world wide web which accepts your query and replies back with some sensible data.<br>  <br>  Now to elaborate,<br>  <br>  A web service is a program/script which is hosted on the internet which anyone can call with some parameters and expect a response. This response can be in any format (a very popular one would be XML, which is how AJAX communication happened in the past, though it is being replaced by JSON very fast). A very good example would be Yahoo Finance or Yahoo Weather.<br>  Suppose you are building a website where you want your users to play stock market and you want to use actual stock prices for that. Now since Yahoo already collects all the stock data and it makes that data available to you through a web service, you would prefer to call that web service and ask for that data which you can then use in your website so that you don't have to collect this data on your own.<br>  Or suppose you are building a social networking website wherein you want every user to see a simple box on his homepage with the details of the weather of the city he belongs to. In this case, you would call the Yahoo weather web service with the city name as a parameter (it actually takes a numeric id, but that can easily be figured out) and expect a response with all the weather details which you can use in your website. Thus you get a very accurate and reliable data with very little effort.<br>  <br>  Amazon and PayPal web services are also not very different from these two. They are also there to send you a response for your requests.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	I've never used either of their services, but a web service is exactly what it says - a service another site can use.  For instance, Yahoo provides a map service.  I can call that service with an address and it returns a map I can put in a div on my page, so it looks as if I generated the map on my site.<br>  <br>  I assume that Amazon allows you to sell something on your site, using services they provide, so it looks as if part of Amazon's site is on your site.<br>  <br>  Another example of a web service would be a stock ticker scrolling across your site - that you get from a site providing that service.|`|CB15kchkaa	Hi, if people wish to pay over the internet for products or services, they wish to make sure that their payment is secure. You never know who you are giving your bank details to over the internet. Paypal is a service which you just need to sign up to and will act as an agent between you and your clients. It means they just need to give details to one company rather than every one they deal with.<br>  Paypal also accepts credit card payments, which means that your customers do not need to have a payal account, but they will be taken to the paypal website to make a credit card payment. It gives you both extra security. <br>  Admiitedly, it can be complicated to understand paypals jargon of gateways and things. What it really means is how a product is associeated with a price. So for example if you were selling various products you would best use the paypal shopping cart. If it's a one off product, then just your email address can be used. You should read through paypals info.|`|vY0ScgeXaa	amazon.com is a whole saler, retailing website,where you can buy stuff<br>  <br>  paypal.com is a payment service, you can buy something on amazon.com and make payment via paypal. paypal is also widely used for transfering money.
n0yf2pxuaa	Talktalk is notorious for bad customer service for their broadband.

Some Friends decided to transfer to Talktalk. Nothing but problems, no connection, lousy customer service (having to repeat problem every time they called somewhere in the far east).

AygEpMMaaa	<a href="http://www.recuva.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.recuva.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Recuva (pronounced "recover") is a freeware Windows utility to restore files that have been accidentally deleted from your computer. This includes files emptied from the Recycle bin as well as images and other files that have been deleted by user error from digital camera memory cards or MP3 players. It will even bring back files that have been deleted by bugs, crashes and viruses!|`|AA11622701	When a file, such as your picture, goes into the recycle bin, it remains there until the bin gets to full.  Then the oldest files are pushed out to make room for new ones.  (Otherwise the recycle bin would eventually fill up the entire hard drive).<br>  <br>  When a file is pushed of the bin, it is actually still there.  All Windows does is moving the directory entry in the bin that points to it, and then adds the files location to a list of available space.  The picture actually stays there until Windows decides to reuse that space for a new file.<br>  <br>  It is possible that the file is still there.  You can try a file recovery program to get it back.  As mentioned above, Recuva is probably the simpliest free recovery programs.  You can get it at <a href="http://recuva.com" rel="nofollow">http://recuva.com</a><br>  <br>  Install and run the program.  It will take it a few minutes, but it will look through the entire hard drive and make a list of all the deleted, but not yet overwritten, files on the drive.  It will then list them for you.  You simply select any that you want to recover, and Recuva will recreate the file for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck....|`|wtVSTuSuaa	Is it still on your camera?<br>  use the search /computer and under search what, select pictures, and where it says enter name type * .

Your sound card has probably partially corrupted and can no longer process sound as fast as it used to.  In all honesty, I would just replace the sound card.  They aren't very expensive, and you could probably find some great deals on <a href="http://www.newegg.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.newegg.com</a>
9FhrFiPbaa	If you don't know the manufacturer or just can't find the driver, a simple solution would be to scan your system with automatic driver update software. This will identify your audio device and other devices as well as locate the proper drivers for each device. You can go to <a href="http://www.pcdriverupdate.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcdriverupdate.com</a> and get a free scan. I recommend scanning your system with this at least once a month to make sure your drivers stay up to date. Keeping your drivers updated will ensure that your computer runs at it's peak performance and stability as well as maximizing it's compatibility with software and games. Also note that using automatic driver updates will avoid the possibility of downloaded an infected driver file because the files pass through the application and are pre-scanned for cleanliness. This is not the case when downloading from websites.|`|IB4uC5bIaa	You need to find out the make of your sound card...if you don't know, use this program:<br>  <a href="http://www.zhangduo.com/udi.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zhangduo.com/udi.html</a><br>  Then go to the manufacturer's website and search in their download and support section.|`|v0CX7sTQaa	Okey…….<br>  <br>  You follow some easy rules…<br>  Step 1 : Go to the website of your Mother Board.<br>  Step 2 : There you will find a option like “Driver Download” or some like that.<br>  Seep 3 :  Driver list will open,  From this driver list, You will find your “Audio Driver”<br>  <br>  Try it…|`|dOMzkQIraa	Find out who the manufacturer is, go to that website.

beQolBQJaa	Xbox 360 xpert, the fear is bigger than the real treat. If you scan with an anti virus (free or not) every file you download before open it you will be fine. I've never used Limewire but it is the place most people complain (true or not). uTorrent is a p2p program, if any virus you happen to find it is coming from the torrent you are downloading and not from the program.<br>  If you are going to be real careful, pay a little more attention to files that come in rar formats, also pay attention to the comments from other people who has downloaded the same file before and wait until the torrent is at least 1 week old, that will give time to other's people opinion on the file ( <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/" rel="nofollow">http://thepiratebay.org/</a> ).<br>  BTW, if you download games with key generators or cracked folders most antivirus will tell it is a virus or trojan but is a false positive.<br>  At the end, if you are in doubt don't do it.<br>  Regards!|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Open up your front door, and who will walk in???

WlYYe3xdaa	One of the most popular Twilight fanfics (Wide Awake) recently had two chapters removed due to explicit content. The author was also blocked from accessing her account. Apparently a complaint was sent to Stephenie Meyer herself (according to the author of Wide Awake who has a copy of said letter) and a few days later the site was down. I think this has started the speculation of a mass M rating purge. I really really hope it was just a rumor that got out of hand. All of my stories, fav stories and alerts are M rated!|`|BJ9Mh4KJaa	I'm honestly not sure what the problem is, but I can say fairly confidently that they are not shutting down the site.  There would be some warning first, and there has been nothing.<br>  <br>  I think it'll be up in a few days, it is most likely just what the message says, a technical glitch, which the tech people are trying to fix.<br>  <br>  That said, I hope it's up soon, because I miss it!  (Check me out when it's back up - pen name is emmy1512)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  Love, ManicPixie|`|H1Oz1lTSaa	Thank God it's not just me. It was driving me insane. At least I know it's not just my computer.<br>  <br>  I don't think they're shutting it down, at least not without warning, but I am worried about a clean up. I'm going out of the country for a few months soon and won't have regular access to a computer, but I'm planning to update a rather lot before then, so maybe mine will be left alone.<br>  <br>  That said - <a href="http://www.fanfiction.net/~independenceindividuality" rel="nofollow">http://www.fanfiction.net/~independencei...</a>|`|SCTVaUCVaa	No, please, no, let this not be another Fourth of July.  When they removed all the NC-17, some good talent left.<br>  <br>  But I doubt that; when they did the removal, they took down the entire site.  Besides, if they didn't want us to log in, there wouldn't be intermittent success on logging in; some people manage to get to the document upload before getting bounced, and sometimes it takes a bit for me to get to the glitch page.  Thus, I don't think this is something that was voluntarily done.|`|JlulDoQHaa	Though not 100 percent certain, I have heard wind of a mass update, I have also heard of a critical error in the server itself...most of it however seems to be leaning toward an massive update, just like when the system seemed to do the same thing in 2007. Anyhow, I agree that it is far more annoying that most other things that I have dealt with in the recent days. I wish I could fully say when the site will be back up but unfortunately......<br>        Anyhow, I simply am going to spend this time catching up on my fics. However, if it does turn out to be the site going down. Does anyone know where else I can post? If not that's a damn shame. Well, I'm annoyed so I'm gonna go send in another little complaint|`|AA11767766	I have no idea what's going on with it. They wouldn't just close the site down without warning though, maybe it is just a glitch.

The downside is that not many games are available for macs (you have to get software that allows you to boot up windows while running the Mac OS), and if you're tech savvy, they don't allow customization.

It's easy, I don't have to spend a ton of money for different programs, because most of what I need is already there.

The OS X is not copy protected, either, meaning if my sister got a Mac, I could give her my OS X software to load into it, and it would be okay. <br>  I didn't have to uninstall a crapload of complimentary preloaded software, and what has been installed is top of the line.

O4oCqaKkaa	You'll need to upgrade you hardware. Fit bigger RAM modules or buy more if space allows.<br>  RAM is an acronym for Random Access Memory that is also known as volatile memory, because the data it holds is lost when the desktop PC or laptop/notebook computer using it is switched off. Briefly, RAM memory is used by the system to store data in the form of files for processing by a computer's central processing unit (CPU), also known as the processor. The processors used in most PCs are made by Intel and AMD. The processor runs the program and data files according to instructions given to it by the operating system, which, on PCs, is usually a version of Windows, or, to a much lesser extent, a version of Linux.<br>  <br>  The amount of RAM memory used in modern computers is expressed in megabytes (MB) and gigabytes (GB). A gigabyte (1GB) is 1024MB. Most new desktop and laptop computers that come with Windows Vista preinstalled should have a minimum of 2GB or RAM memory.|`|peFufWeYaa	You should include more info, as to how much ram you have currently installed. But first, you should check the "system requirements" for the program you wish to run. If it needs more ram than you have installed to for it to run properly, there is no real solution except install more ram. Or possibly, find another program that can do dictation with less ram. <br>  <br>  RAM are hardware chips installed onto your motherboard. Deleting programs will not give you more ram. Having said this, you can clear as much free space as possible on your hard disk, you can go to control panel, system, performance, advanced, and set your virtual memory larger, and you can clear your temp folder under my computer, right click on c: drive, clear disk space. <br>  <br>  But I am not sure this will solve the issue. Probably you need to add more ram, but it is not that expensive|`|mXe1tbHdaa	Your question is very vague.<br>  It would be useful to give some indications about your system (RAM amount, OS and version mainly).<br>  <br>  In first analyze, 2 situations are to be considered :<br>  - you "defenitively" have not enough memory whatever you could do<br>  - you "waste" some RAM with some goodies<br>  <br>  By definitively, I mean of course without buying some more.<br>  But be careful, such a situation is relatively rare for now or your systeme is "old" and in this case adding additional memory is not so obvious and maybe expensive.<br>  <br>  Now, let's take a look at the second scenario.<br>  <br>  First of all, you should look at what is running on your PC and wich is not necessary (things like screen saver and a lot of pieces of software more or less useful). Generally, but not always, this kind of memory hunters put an icon in the systray (at the right end of the task bar).<br>  If so, start with right-clicking on each of them. Very often, you'll get an option to quit or exit the software. After doing that, try your dictation software. If it's ok, you could consider not starting automatically, the softwares you stopped (using Msconfig).<br>  <br>  Hopping that help you.|`|2gbhtXE8aa	you can free some ram space by using advanced system care from www.iobit.com. it has a tool called smart ram.<br>  again the best option is buying a higher ram - though you didnt say how much ram you've got or your OS|`|ggMDAo0Kaa	install 2 gigs of memory or delete pics and music|`|Dx3HRlXiaa	i have 1028mb and its just fine...ahahahahahaha the feast will be mine 2009|`|KyvbbSQ9aa	rebooting your computer will clear your RAM, however, if the software recommends a certain amount of RAM, say for example the say it requires 1GB of RAM and you only have 512MB, then you should upgrade your RAM prior to installing as the software may not run properly, if at all.<br>  <br>  You can also increase the size of your virtual memory as a "temporary" solution.  Here's how to do that in XP<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/increase-virtual-memory.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/i...</a>|`|SW6sxC7yaa	To free up your available RAM, look at using the built-in windows command 'msconfig' (<a href="http://netsquirrel.com/msconfig/)" rel="nofollow">http://netsquirrel.com/msconfig/)</a><br>  <br>  Running this program and disabling system services/programs that run at startup - you will have more free memory to load applications.<br>  <br>  To try this out before you go changing things with msconfig, look at the bottom right hand corner of your screen - it should have icons representing the programs that are currently loaded in memory. Try closing a few of these and seeing if your software runs any better.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, look into programs such as CCleaner which clean the registry and delete temporary files that would otherwise just take up space.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|D5oi4DJfaa	You can transfer picture and music file in a flask disk and some other files to free space in your RAM just to give space for your dictation software.|`|oTWKHjDyaa	You cannot "free up RAM". RAM is something you just have not something you can create more of. You can get more RAM by adding it to your computer. RAM is NOT memory (or how much space your computer can hold).

Unfortunately, it's not popular,so most music is still recorded in ordinary stereo CDs, or downloaded in the much worse .mp3 format. <br>  <br>  To make things worse, most people won't recognize any difference between the absolutely superior DVD-audio and a CD.<br>  <br>  If your DVD burning software doesn't support DVD-audio, you might simulate it, for example, creating videos with a still image.|`|IB4uC5bIaa	Yes but it won't play in a stereo, just a DVD player, Xbox and so on...|`|VeBh959raa	i think DVD is for video recording and for audio you use CD|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	Yes, and you can record videos on CD. Just DVD has more storage.|`|AA11622701	Yes, no and maybe.<br>  <br>  You can record music onto a DVD just like you would a CD.<br>  <br>  The problem is that while they look the same to us humans, they look very different to computers and Cd players. The tracks and sectors are laid out different, and are much more compact on a DVD, which is why they can store more information.  So most CD players can not read a DVD.  The tracks are too tight for the head to read them.<br>  <br>  So while a music DVD will play fine in a computer with a DVD player, and will play as a audio disk in some (50/50) DVD players, it will not play in a CD player such as in your car.|`|chHPoiThaa	Yes can just follow the next instructions.<br>  <br>  CD DVD BURNING<br>  you can only put a film on a CD if~<br>  1 The film fits i.e. it is not over 70/80 minutes (depends on CD size)<br>  2 You put it on as data if you try to convert a film onto a CD the drive will not recognize there is a disk in.<br>  To put a film on a CD ~IT WILL ONLY PLAY ON YOUR PC,<br>  you must burn it as "data"<br>  To burn as data or put music and films on CD/DVD’s or copy music and films I use this <br>  it is free ~ <a href="http://freeeasyburner.com" rel="nofollow">http://freeeasyburner.com</a><br>  try as well~<br>  <a href="http://k-litecodecpack.com" rel="nofollow">http://k-litecodecpack.com</a> this makes sure the data CD plays<br>  if you have DVD’s<br>  you can get up to 6 films on 1 DVD as data<br>  if it is a film you have downloaded and want to watch on your tv using a dvd player you need a conversion program<br>  <a href="http://sothink_dvd_movie_maker.ensoftoni..." rel="nofollow">http://sothink_dvd_movie_maker.ensoftoni...</a><br>  is a free one <br>  download ~soft and k-lite<br>  this needs a dvd to be put on<br>  if you need more info edit your question<br>  hope this helps.

Thompson make good stable routers that are proven in the market, however the Netgear has proven to be the most popular in the market. Have you got two phone lines in your house? and is it a big house? If it is, why not use both. As long as you do not use them both at the same time they will work ad cover different parts of the house. Just make the SSID and WEP or WPA codes different and you will have no problems.

If not, limited but free services exist such as the free online scan on the Symatec website. These scanners detect and remove viruses and other malicious things embedded in your computer.<br>  <br>  Step3<br>  Download a spyware detection program.

The more people using it the less slice of the dat pie your going to get.<br>  <br>  The Assured rate your not going to get anywhere as you're still above the BT whinge cut off of 600 and your seeing 706 which is bad I know.<br>  <br>  Ignoring the Option Package your on the bottom line is you are at the end of a long line and sharing your slice with a lot of people.<br>  <br>  Now you could post your SNR margins from your router but that won't get you very far.<br>  <br>  You could check out the hardware at your end but that would be another post.<br>  <br>  Welcome to the world of RADSL. Those stats are pretty rubbish and you have to do some cleaning up at your end to see if you can improve on them before you have any recourse with BT.<br>  <br>  ANy more help message me.|`|dySHIwYxaa	Your getting about 3mb speed, not 8mb. Bt need to fix this, ring them up and get them to fix.<br>  <br>  Last time I checked, BT use 'traffic shaping' so BT will slow down your connection when the cables are very busy.  (That why i would never touch BT Internet.)<br>  <br>  I pay ￡21 per month With TalkTalk, this include my line rental, unlimited broadband @ 8mb speed (I get 7mb in speed tests).<br>  also I get free day/ eve/ weekend phone calls to uk land line numbers.<br>  <br>  <br>  So BT (as you would expect) is a little more expensive than the competition. And your getting a very slow speed from them.<br>  <br>  The slow internet speed could be for many reasons, If you live a long away from your local telephone exchange (I guess you must be well over 1 mile away, judging fro your speed), not much you can do about that.<br>  <br>  You can reduce your phone line static by cutting the phone bell wire (wire connected on terminal number 3 in your phone cable), or buy an i-plate (￡10) that does the same thing. This will educe the static on your line and will increase your modem speed.<br>  <br>  You can re-set your Internet protocol (see BT or Bt web site for instructions) as this can often fix problems.<br>  <br>  Make sure your ASDL modem is connected into your master BT socket (not extensions).<br>  <br>  Never use any ready made phone extension cables (the kinda thing that is sold in supermarkets, that has a phone plugs and a cheap thin cable as a 'ready to use' phone extension cable), as they kill your ADSL internet speed.<br>  <br>  Phone BT and demand they fix your slow internet speed.<br>  They have the power to give a little boost, if you demand enough.

pUzJiMUcaa	I would say borderline impossible, but then, I'm assuming that you also have no training or skills with any kind of virtual media design.<br>  <br>  Ya see the font that this is in? That's deliberate. Look around the page, see if you can find a serifed font. You'll likely only see one or two on ANY given page (this one, I see one...and it's the Yahoo! logo). This is one of the hundreds of little things that you learn when you go for a degree in web design. You also learn about the big differences between print design, and web page design, you learn about why color management is, again, different between the two. You learn about contrast, lighting, perception...and in between all of that, you learn how to code it all<br>  <br>  You also learn how to use the vast array of features included in a Dreamweaver.<br>  <br>  I am not trying to say that you cannot make a website, or that you should not try. There is ALWAYS a need for more designers (all the good ones are taken up by the big firms, so small businesses get stuck with the leftovers). I am saying this: Don't underestimate it. If you're a business owner who is thinking "This can't be that hard, I'll just do it myself!", save yourself the headache and find a good designer to handle it.<br>  <br>  If you want to get into the field, well, like I said: You've got a bit to learn. I wouldn't start with the coding syntax, it's likely to confuse you. Start with design concepts, learning about why things should look the way they do. As you read through books that talk about design concepts, you'll notice the code will start to make more sense than if you just dive right into HTML and CSS. Don't get me wrong though: You absolutely need to have a very very solid understanding of HTML and CSS if you want to be a good designer.<br>  <br>  One book I recommend checking out: The Zen of CSS Design<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zen-CSS-Design-Visual-Enlightenment/dp/0321303474" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Zen-CSS-Design-Vis...</a><br>  <br>  It is a book that partners with this site: <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.csszengarden.com/</a><br>  <br>  The book focuses on the WHY, not the HOW (which is what any budding designer needs to learn).<br>  <br>  You don't need a degree to be a good designer...everything you need to learn, you can learn on your own. You DO need to learn the art of graphic manipulation...so check out Photoshop, Fireworks and Illustrator while you're studying the "why". A great Photoshop book is Studio Techniques, by Wilmore. Quite possibly the best book to learn Photoshop. It also delves into the differences between print and online media.|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	About as easy as it is to learn to drive by being a passenger.<br>  <br>  If you want to learn to build a website, you have to learn how to build a website.  That means the concepts first, not a tool that does some of the work for you (and it only does some of the work - if you don't know what you're doing you might end up with a website [although you probably won't], but it won't be a decent-looking one, and it certainly won't do anything.)<br>  <br>  Learn HTML and CSS.  Learn the client-server model (why you can't access a database with Javascript) and the document object model.  Learn computer programming (<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0130224189/ref=pd_bbs_sr_olp_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212765521&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0...</a> is the best book I've found for that, in 30 years of teaching programming).  Learn Javascript, SQL and PHP.<br>  <br>  Then use a text editor to build your first few websites.  Learn to pedal a bike before jumping on a motorcycle.  The skills you pick up writing your own sites will not only be VERY valuable when you try a program like Dreamweaver (but don't buy it - try a free version first - like Kompozer), it'll probably turn you off to using a program like that completely.  Once you're comfortable creating websites, programs like Dreamweaver just get in your way.<br>  <br>  If you want a good tool for website building, use Firefox as your browser, and use the Firebug add-on.  Use Aptana Studio for development.  (There are so many free things out there - that are better than most of the things you have to pay for - that I wonder why people pay for inferior ways of doing things.)|`|Yu7vBUkOaa	Forget Dreamweaver.<br>  <br>  If you want to do a decent job, you need to know what you are crafting and not trust some software to do it for you based on a picture.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://opera.com/wsc/" rel="nofollow">http://opera.com/wsc/</a> makes a good starting point.<br>  <br>  Dreamweaver might prove useful /once/ you know what you are doing, but it probably isn't worth the cost.|`|jSq4ZO1uaa	Use  a web host offering free easy-to-use site builder. <br>  <br>  As you may know a domain name is just a name, not a real website.

There are many non-technical factors, such as, price or good and bad previous experience with a specific company or product. I only work with Microsoft compatible computers which support the most application software so all my comments apply only to that type of PC.<br>   <br>  There are a number of important technical considerations that are not always obvious.<br>   <br>  More memory will help with performance than an equal amount of money spent on a faster processor. XP likes at least 512MB. Power users will want 1 GB.  The approximately $70 spent bringing a desktop system up to 512 from 256 is a good investment.<br>   <br>  Plan for back-up media. Too many people fail to back-up their systems and loose important data when something bad happens to the computer. With CD writers costing less then $100 (free with most new systems) and the media less than 50 cents, there is no reason to not back-up your data. DVD writers are a little more expensive but offer 7 times more capacity. DVD is not just for movies but makes a great back-up media also.<br>   <br>  Photographs, Music and Movies can take an enormous amount of space. Eighty GB hard drive should be the minimum. If you think you want to convert your pictures, music and work with movies get more.<br>   <br>  Desktop systems with flat LCD monitors are very nice. They take up a lot less space but be sure to compare the DPI (dots per inch) specification. If you like to open multiple windows some of the less expensive LCD monitors do not provide adequate resolution to display multiple screens with a lot of data displayed at the same time. Conventional CRTs still give the best picture for the least dollar. Look for a flat screen CRT model that is easier to read with less glare. A 17 in. monitor should be the minimum size because anything smaller will not display web pages without scrolling.<br>   <br>  If you want a Notebook make sure you consider the weight. It sounds great to have a “full function” portable computer but they are HEAVY. If you carry it a lot, weight can be a real issue you may not understand until it is too late and you already own it.<br>   <br>  Unless you are part of a networked Domain you probably do not need XP/pro. If your company has you logon to a domain you must use XP/Pro. It is a lot cheaper to buy it with the computer than it is to add it later.<br>   <br>  Some manufacturers sell bundled software a lot cheaper than you can buy any where else. The Microsoft Works package for about $15 includes Word, Works spreadsheet, Money, Encarta, Picture It and Streets.<br>   <br>  Wireless networking allows file, print and Internet sharing with very little cost for the networking hardware. If you have a notebook with wireless support you have free high speed Internet at many local Austin Hot Spots around Austin just as easy as you connect at home.<br>   <br>  Do not try to upgrade your computer with someone else’s XP operating system or Office/Pro. The next time you both log into Microsoft to get updates you will both be stopped. You can not avoid buying legal copies the the operating system anymore. If you do this it a real problem to fix.|`|c0UakxMMaa	physical appearance would be the least important, you buy a computer for its abilities, not its looks.<br>  <br>  CPU speed would be on top of the list, along with hard drive space/speed and amount of memory in the machine, video card is important if you play games<br>  <br>  printing ability depends on the printer, and not the computer itself, so not important when buying a PC|`|eQTaDwY5aa	Oh my gosh, how you gonna read all these long answers,<br>  Ok its easy and simple, you need fast and cheap price, use the tools that provided by Best buy it will make it easy, usually it depends about your needs first considerations always the Microprocessor and the Ram size (2GB) and up, <br>  <br>  good luck|`|b8VRlStoaa	Have the best of all the worlds, and Dont forgett main factor D.

c09139108aa8733a67015449f3fd54b9aa	Don't worry about it.  Computer hard drives are precision pieces of equipment,  and the ride in the garbage truck would be enough to destroy it.  Something to keep in mind though if it makes you feel better electronics recyclers drill three holes in hard drives so they are physically unreadable. You don't need to worry though, if nothing has happened after 11 month it's not going to.|`|3Yg14Jxfaa	It is legitimate concern; however, did you delete data from hard drive or did you use a program to scrub your hard drive. If you didn't use a program to scrub your hard drive you can leave yourself vulnerable if someone found your hard drive in the garbage. If someone found your hard drive they might have used it for a replacement part and not to look at the data previously on the hard drive. No one can give you an absolute answer; however, you should place a fraud alert on your credit report and look for the following signs: <br>  <a href="http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/idtheft/consumers/detect.html#Whatarethesignsofidentitytheft" rel="nofollow">http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/edu/microsites/id...</a>|`|abINltRAaa	well if it went out with the trash, just the hard drive (why were you throwing it out anyway?) chances are is got crushed and/or wet, both which would make it unusable. If you didn't have any personal information, like credit card or tax information, then you're probably fine. Don't worry about it' just keep an eye on your credit information just in case, which I would recommend for anyone.

gtcQ8l5laa	The latest version is more compatible with Office and has some cool new features, such as controlling Keynote with an iPod Touch or iPhone if you so wish. Not only that but it is generally quicker and adds a lot to the user experience. Remember, iWork '08 is actually from 2007, so '09 is actually a year and a half newer, not just a year. Don't let the choice of name fool you into thinking it's newer than it truly is.<br>  <br>  Alternatively, Office for Mac is a solid choice. As a rule of thumb Word and Pages are fairly equal with positives and negatives weighed up, while Keynote is better than Powerpoint. Excel is much better than Numbers though, especially with more complex tasks. <br>  <br>  The last paragraph is of course assuming you were looking around iWork's price point, there are more complete versions of Office that cost much more.|`|eQTaDwY5aa	the new version 09 better and the reason its faster when it comes the structure, <br>  have fun with your new MAC|`|qkqkj5MRaa	mac is one of the lastest OS....it supports all kinds softwares and it has automatic updates....with firewall,spyware and malware protection...it handles automatically...|`|dySHIwYxaa	i-work is ok, But you can buy Microsoft Office 2007 for the Mac, honest its better than i-work., thats why its so popular on the Mac.<br>  <br>  If you do decide to get I-work, save the money and get the 08 edition.<br>  <br>  Or you could go for open office, a free download office suite.|`|wGCCMjVsaa	yh the difference is there both ****, throw away your fisherprice laptop and man up to a pc

Some of the old Pentium 4's ran at 2.7 Ghz, but they have long since been out of date.  If you have a Core2Duo or Core2Quad running at 2.7 Ghz, that is most likely not your problem.  2 GB of memory should be fine for most gaming, given that it is good memory. Also, what speed is it? Because 2 GB of DDR-400 is not enough, but 2GB of DDR2-800 or DDR2-1066 is enough.<br>  <br>  More information is needed to diagnose your problem. What graphics card do you have?  If your graphics card is relatively powerful, i.e. 8800GT or higher, your bottleneck (where the data slows down during transfer) might be your graphics card. I have a 9800 GTX, and my FPS's were mediocre at best, but when I overclocked my processor, I saw a 146% increase in FPS during gaming, indicating that the bottleneck in my system was my CPU.<br>  <br>  If you provide some more specifics, it would be much easier to tell where your bottleneck is.|`|sar2OWGEaa	2 gigs of ram is just for the processor to use but your FPS comes mainly from how well your video card is. You should have at least a 512mb discrete (dedicated) graphics card if you want to do some gaming. Alot of the new games recommend 512mb graphics cards. your processor is pretty good. Your best bet is to build your own computer with a dual core processor by Intel or AMD (your choice) with at least 2.4 GHZ to do some serious gaming. I personally recommend an ATI graphics card with 512mb. and at least 4 gigs of ram. You can build one yourself cheaper than going out and spending alot of money on ram, processor, and graphics cards. Go to www.newegg.com and order all the parts there at a very good price. Also you would spend more money going through hp or dell or anybody ordering a gaming computer.|`|qkqkj5MRaa	Your processor may be 2.7 Ghz, but that alone is not enough information to give a good answer.

A better video card could also help. You could also make the program into a window mode, and close other programs.
QYPrM3GPaa	I just looked at those two pictures and to be honest with you, I do NOT see any differences.  If anything, I see slightly more jagged edges on what you call the best and a finer liner on what you call the worst.  So i think you are over stressing yourself in trying to find a problem where there is none.  Its not just the graphics card, ok?  It is also the quality of the programming of the software.  You can have the very best video card and a poor experience if the dang software is written poorly.<br>  <br>  If you want a really better card, get a Radeon HD 4870 card with 1 gig on it.  Frankly, I do not see anything in your pictures that justifies having to buy another card...why not just live with what you have?|`|RX4y2zkMaa	Its the game fog, and the engine. Some games fade the objects out and other lower the quality at distance its all to keep the frame rate high. If every object was drawn at full quality all the time even with the best home PC avilable the game would soon slow to a crawl.<br>  <br>  For example sometimes you may notice that your fave game slows down when a lot of action hapens on screen. That would be the game all the time if quality was rendered all the time on distance objects.<br>  <br>  The setting are mostly hard coded into the game.|`|gwk7ivO7aa	That looks like the shadow quality.

g62ATenqaa	The default margins are 2.54 cm top and bottom but 3.17 for left and right. However this is for American letter size paper so I suggest you change your margins to 2.54 all round - 1".<br>  You mention columns, are you working in columns or tables? If so, it could be that it has nothing to do with the margins because it will only create columns or tables to existing margins, but rather the formatting of the paragraph. It could be that you have indented somehow so I suggest highlighting everything, right button down to paragraph and making sure that the indentation is set to 0 for both left and right.

I haven't tried using it on mpg or flv files, but you can convert those easily using programs like "quick media converter" or super by eRightsoft.<br>  <br>  Once you have a good avi file, just drop them into the dvdflick main window, set to have the dvd burned directly to the disc and in 45 minutes, you'll have your DVD.|`|vohluiHVaa	you have to burn in dvd format(there is one separately) or in .avi format

ADc0yibuaa	All of the answers so far are restatements of what is being questioned—the common wisdom that complex passwords are more secure. I think a mathematical explanation is necessary.

I mean, computers use algorithms to encrypt things. So if that algorithm is busted, then so is your password. But special characters such as !@#$%^&* could blend in with the encryption and confuse a cracker. And I'm not familiar with the term "salt".|`|vohluiHVaa	password strength depends on the number of characters and some extra characters.

dySHIwYxaa	A TV tuner is needed just to receive via an aerial Tv broadcasts. (You must have a TV license if your using this TV card).<br>  You can stream Tv via your internet connection via many sites, with out a TV card.  So i would say its not very useful to have a TV card.<br>  <br>  I would hold on until Windows 7 is out (could be as early as August this year), as Windows 7 is a lot better than Vista.<br>  <br>  I think the 1st is better value, as you dont require any special hardware for your needs, the cheaper one is fine.<br>  <br>  You could get similar spec with a lot less cash, I think you could get this spec for around 1/3 less money.<br>  <br>  Try ebuyer.com and see the price of the base units and select a monitor as a separate item.<br>  <br>  e.g<br>  25.5"Samsung monitor ￡274.30<br>  <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/product/143328" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebuyer.com/product/143328</a><br>  <br>  Base unit Quad core processor with 4GB ram ￡400.<br>  <a href="http://www.ebuyer.com/product/143328" rel="nofollow">http://www.ebuyer.com/product/143328</a><br>  <br>  Then buy a graphics card, ￡60 + card will be fine<br>  <br>  As Euro to ￡ rate is good for Euro spenders, you should get a very good deal.<br>  <br>  A blue ray player are from ￡100.|`|j1BvhTB3aa	For what you need save yourself some money and go for the first one. <br>  <br>  The processor is superb for anything that you want to do. I would only tend to advocate a quad core you you are planning on doing a lot of gaming/photoshopping/video editing and want something that can handle a lot at once. The dual core processor there is much more than enough to fit your needs. <br>  <br>  Both have 4GB of RAM, which is very nice. The first one only had the 500GB Hard Drive, but remember you can always just buy an external one for around 100$ (US) if you need more storage. <br>  <br>  The graphics card is the other discrepancy, and for you its not a big deal. If you ever want to play advanced or new games you may want to consider the second one, but from what i gather from you you're not big into that so i wouldn't really advocate spending more for it. <br>  <br>  Both have the Blu-Ray drives, which is a huge plus. And the fact that one is Vista Ultimate and the other is HOme Premium really doesn't matter at all for you. You'd also barely notice the 1 inch bigger screen<br>  <br>  I'd save some bread and take the first one if i were you.|`|lngQJxPEaa	I would recommend that you get the second one.  If you put in a little extra cash, it will help in the long run.  If you can afford it, then i would  say go for it!<br>  <br>  It has a larger screen which is perfect if you like watching movies on it.<br>  <br>  It has twice as much memory!<br>  <br>  It even looks more sleek<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

What you have are called e-mail forgeries.<br>  <br>  Using any e-mail program, it can be trivial to forge the From: line on an e-mail message. It's just as easy as taking a postal letter and putting the home address of a friend in the upper right corner. USPS does not verify the return address on letters. Internet does not verify the return address of e-mail messages. Unfortunately, there's nothing you can do to stop this. Complaining to Yahoo! won't help because it isn't coming from your account.<br>  <br>  Whomever gave that thumbs down clearly does not understand how this happens.<br>  <br>  Those who claimed wireless was a problem are also wrong. Yahoo! login page uses HTTPS to encrypt your connection to their servers, thereby prevent hackers from snooping your password out of the air. That little padlock at the bottom of your web browser tells you it is safe to type your password from a wireless location.|`|XbpJO3jHaa	Send yourself an email that they will really want to open, put a small image inside it and you should be able to trace them if you host that image somewhere. You can also trace them if they send an email from your account as the IP should be in the email header. perhaps change your password AND secret questions? It might also be a good idea to virus scan or reinstall your operating system.<br>  <br>  They could always be masking their real IP by going though a proxy and you can't do much if thats the case. Oh and if your on wireless you're screeeewed ;)|`|dOMzkQIraa	You can't trace it. Send an email to abuse@yahoo.com with the details.|`|e0fe2e25bb39063e841fda6e39a6fe39aa	you cant.
AA10394789	I have tried 16 different bittorrent clients and they all run at about the same speed when properly set up.  uTorrent is one of the best and if you are not getting good speeds on that you will not get good speed on the others.<br>  <br>  This guide may help with your speed<br>  Optimizing μTorrent for Speed<br>  <a href="http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/optimizing-torrent-speed.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.techsupportalert.com/content/...</a><br>  <br>  btjunkie lists torrents from other sites so it is not like their listed torrents would vary much either.  Since your download depends on the upload capacity of others in the swarm, speeds in bittorrent can vary greatly.  The best you can do is look for torrents that have a high seed to peer ratio.|`|ULw1777caa	All pretty much the same.|`|dOMzkQIraa	They all use the same protocol, so they're all the same. <br>  <br>  Your download speed is dictated by the number of seeders. You also need to open a port on your firewall (if you're behind one).
