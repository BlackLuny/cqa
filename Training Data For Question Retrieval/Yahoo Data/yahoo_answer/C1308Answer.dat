ahS4TuSEaa	You were sleepwalking and did it w/o realizing it.|`|I5FsYmjIaa	You were that HIGH|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well this is a movie for you to watch I don't know if you have have seen it or not but it is called The Sixth Sense,click here to watch it and certain scenes in the movie are paranormal,  http://www.watch-movies.net/movies/the_s...    there might or may be paranormal activity going on in your house,read this    1. Intuition - Trust your instincts. It is common for people to have the sense they are being   watched. They feel uneasy about spending time in certain areas of their home.    2. Trouble Sleeping - Frequent waking in the night, difficulty falling asleep and insomnia are all   potential signs of paranormal activity in your home.    3. Moving/Hiding Objects - Some ghosts are able to move furniture, but it is more common for   them to move small objects less than 10 pounds. This is a very effective way for a ghost to get a   reaction from a living person.    4. Temperature Changes - Sudden temperature changes in certain rooms may be a sign of   paranormal activity. A sudden draft or a sudden warm spot may indicate you're not the only   being in the room.  1. Unexplained noises - footsteps; knocks, banging, rapping; scratching sounds; sounds of something being dropped. Sometimes these noises can be subtle and other times they can be quite loud.    2. Doors, cabinets and cupboards opening and closing - most often, these phenomena are not seen directly. The resident either hears the distinct sounds of the doors opening and closing (homeowners get to know quite well the distinctive sounds their houses make) or the experiencer will return to a room to find a door open or closed when they are certain it was left in the opposite position. Sometimes furniture, like kitchen chairs, are perceived to have been moved. Very rarely will someone actually witness the phenomenon taking place.    3. Feelings of being touched - the feeling of being watched is one thing, and actually feeling like you are being touched is quite another. Some people feel something brush past them, something touching their hair or "a hand" on the shoulder. Some feel a gentle poke, push or nudge. Some have even experienced the sensation that an energy (not their own) has gone right through them.    4. Other physical evidence - unexplained writing on paper or walls; handprints and footprints.    Lights turning off and on - likewise, these events are seldom seen actually occurring, but the lights are switched on or off when the person knows they were not left that way. This can also happen with TVs, radios and other electrically powered items.    6. Items disappearing and reappearing - Others have called this "the borrowers" phenomenon. It is the familiar experience of not being able to find a regularly used item - say, a set of car keys - which one believes they placed in a spot they routinely place them. But they're gone and one looks high and low for them with no success. Some time later, the keys are found - in exactly the place you normally put them. It's as if the object was borrowed by someone or something for a short time, then returned. Sometimes they are not returned for days or even weeks, but when they are, it's in an obvious place that could not have been missed by even a casual search.    7. Strange animal behavior - a dog, cat or other pet behaves strangely. Dogs may bark at something unseen, cower without apparent reason or refuse to enter a room they normally do. Cats may seem to be "watching" something cross a room. Animals have sharper senses than humans, and many researchers think their psychic abilities might be more finely tuned also.    8. Mild psycho-kinetic phenomena - hearing a door open or close is one thing. Actually seeing it happen is quite another. Similarly, actually seeing a light go on or off by itself is greater proof that something unexplained is happening. This could be a radio or tv turning on and off. Or perhaps when a child's powered toy begins to operate on its own. Doors and windows are locked or unlocked. Some people report that when they are in bed they can feel and/or hear something sitting on the bed.  Cries and whispers - on occasion, muffled voices, whispering and crying can be heard. Sometimes it's music from some unknown source. People hear their names being said. This phenomenon gains more credibility if more than one person hears or sees the same thing at the same time.    10. Cold or hot spots - cold spots are classic haunting symptoms, but any instance of a noticeable variance in temperature without a discernable cause could be evidence.    11. Unexplained smells - the distinct fragrance of a perfume or cologne that you do not have in your house. This phenomenon comes and goes without any apparent cause and may accompany other phenomena, such as shadows, voices or psycho-kinetic phenomena. Unfortunately it is not always a pleasant scent, but a foul odor which is perceived.    12. Feelings of being watched - this is not an uncommon feeling and can be attributed to many things, but it|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Hmm, unless one of them is not telling you the truth then I don't know how to explain that.

I think it has to do with a combination of the hinges and wheels on the drawers and such that makes them open up really easily..The house that was built on the land might of shifted a little (not an earth quake) and caused the house to be at an angle slightly and they all slide opened. How old is the house? The metals might of gotten oiled (while you where not looking)     That's the only possible way it can happen without the other things you counted out. If you live on a hill I would check that out..maybe your house has been built on soft ground proving my theory was correct.     I gave up on the paranormal, I never seen anything paranormal in my life and most likely never will..There is an explanation to everything.     have a good day. ^_^

f0ed2ce5d291634d748cb1ae9b52d651aa	t = (1/4) = /4    Draw a unit circle with X- and Y-axes.    Starting on the positive side of the X-axis (to the right of the origin), draw the angle  /4, counterclockwise. Remember, 2 radians = 360o, so (1/4) radians = 45o.    So you should have a line (maybe it's called the terminal line?) from the origin (O)  to a point on the circle (call it P), such that the line bisects Quadrant I.    Now draw a line from P vertically downwards to touch the X-axis at Q.    Triangle OPQ is right-angled at Q and the hypotenuse OP is standardly equal to 1.    sin(/4) = PQ / OP, but OP = 1, so sin(/4) = PQ.  We know from the 45o-45o-90o triangle that sin(45o) = sin(/4) = 2/2, so PQ = 2/2.    cos(/4) = OQ / OP, so cos(/4) = OQ.  We know also, that cos(45o) = cos(/4) = 2/2, so OQ = 2/2.    Therefore, point Q = (2/2, 0) and point P = (2/2, 2/2),  where point P is the terminal point.

5DlXCEplaa	6 2/8 becomes 6 6/24 because whatever you do to the demoninator, you must do the same to the numerator, or else you change the number.  The whole point of converting the denominator is to allow mathematical operations WITHOUT CHANGING THE ORIGINAL DATA.    6 2/6 = (6*6 + 2)/6 = 38/6  To make the denomintor 24, you multiply the fraction by 4/4, or 1 (4/4 = 1) - which doesn't change the number.    (4/4)(38/6) = 152/24 or 6 8/24.     If you had only multiplied the denominator, or (1/4)(38/6) = 38/24 - you actually divided the original number by 4, which changes the question - you don't want to do that!    The steps involved:    6 2/6 + 2/8  = (6*6 + 2)/6 + 2/8  = 38/6 + 2/8  = (4/4)(38/6) + (3/3)(2/8)  = 152/24 + 6/24  = 158/24  = 6 14/24  = 6 7/12    As you can see, you should convert from mixed fraction form (6 7/12 - where there's a whole number and a fraction aspect) to improper form (79/12 - where the numerator is larger than the denominator) before converting the denominator.    For your other example:    8 2/3 + 7 4/6  First convert to improper form:  (8*3 + 2)/3 + (7*6 + 4)/6 = 26/3 + 46/6  Now convert to common denominators - LCD here is 6:  (2/2)(26/3) + 46/6  = 52/6 + 46/6   = 98/6  = 16 2/6  = 16 1/3|`|RS7wQ5pdaa	the numerators change too because if u think about it 1/8th os a cake is 3/24ths of a cake and 2/16ths as well. to get the numerator when u change the denominator u you multiply the numerator by the same number you use when u multiply the denominator to get the new one. so 8/24 would become 1/3 because u divide 24 by 8 to get 3. so u divide 8 by 8 to get one.  in your question 6 2/6 is 6 8/24 and 2/8 is 6/24 because u multiply 6 by 4 to get 24 so u multiply the numerator, 2, by 4 as well resulting in 8 and so on.

The formula is:  (Number 1 / Number 2)  = (100% / X%)    The questions give you 2 numbers.  You need to figure out which number goes where, then the equation.  For example, question  1:   "What percent of 110 is 88?", is answered like this:    (110 / 88) = (100%  /  X%)    re-arrange to get rid of the fraction by multiplying opposite sides of the equation by the other sides denominator (if you multiply or divide both sides of an equation by the same amount, nothing changes but you can simplify the equation):    X% *  88  *  (110 / 88) = (100% / X%) * X% * 88     * 88 cancels / 88 on the left side and * X% cancels / X% on the right, so  you are left with:     X% * 110  = 100% * 88    (fyi 100% = 1)    Now, you need to isolate the X%.  If you do the same thing to both sides of an equation, nothing changes, but you can simplify the equation.  So, divide both sides by 110.  You will get    X% = 1* 88 / 100           X% = 88 / 110    Now use your calculator.  All the other questions can be solved the same way, just plug the numbers into the right slot.

vAU57Hitaa	Reproductive cloning is a technology used to generate an animal that has the same nuclear DNA as another currently or previously existing animal. Dolly was created by reproductive cloning technology. In a process called "somatic cell nuclear transfer" (SCNT), scientists transfer genetic material from the nucleus of a donor adult cell to an egg whose nucleus, and thus its genetic material, has been removed. The reconstructed egg containing the DNA from a donor cell must be treated with chemicals or electric current in order to stimulate cell division. Once the cloned embryo reaches a suitable stage, it is transferred to the uterus of a female host where it continues to develop until birth.     Dolly or any other animal created using nuclear transfer technology is not truly an identical clone of the donor animal. Only the clone's chromosomal or nuclear DNA is the same as the donor. Some of the clone's genetic materials come from the mitochondria in the cytoplasm of the enucleated egg. Mitochondria, which are organelles that serve as power sources to the cell, contain their own short segments of DNA. Acquired mutations in mitochondrial DNA are believed to play an important role in the aging process.     Dolly's success is truly remarkable because it proved that the genetic material from a specialized adult cell, such as an udder cell programmed to express only those genes needed by udder cells, could be reprogrammed to generate an entire new organism. Before this demonstration, scientists believed that once a cell became specialized as a liver, heart, udder, bone, or any other type of cell, the change was permanent and other unneeded genes in the cell would become inactive. Some scientists believe that errors or incompleteness in the reprogramming process cause the high rates of death, deformity, and disability observed among animal clones.       Therapeutic Cloning     Therapeutic cloning, also called "embryo cloning," is the production of human embryos for use in research. The goal of this process is not to create cloned human beings, but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to treat disease. Stem cells are important to biomedical researchers because they can be used to generate virtually any type of specialized cell in the human body. Stem cells are extracted from the egg after it has divided for 5 days. The egg at this stage of development is called a blastocyst. The extraction process destroys the embryo, which raises a variety of ethical concerns. Many researchers hope that one day stem cells can be used to serve as replacement cells to treat heart disease, Alzheimer's, cancer, and other diseases. See more on the potential use of cloning in organ transplants.     In November 2001, scientists from Advanced Cell Technologies (ACT), a biotechnology company in Massachusetts, announced that they had cloned the first human embryos for the purpose of advancing therapeutic research. To do this, they collected eggs from women's ovaries and then removed the genetic material from these eggs with a needle less than 2/10,000th of an inch wide. A skin cell was inserted inside the enucleated egg to serve as a new nucleus. The egg began to divide after it was stimulated with a chemical called ionomycin. The results were limited in success. Although this process was carried out with eight eggs, only three began dividing, and only one was able to divide into six cells before stopping.       How can cloning technologies be used?  Recombinant DNA technology is important for learning about other related technologies, such as gene therapy, genetic engineering of organisms, and sequencing genomes. Gene therapy can be used to treat certain genetic conditions by introducing virus vectors that carry corrected copies of faulty genes into the cells of a host organism. Genes from different organisms that improve taste and nutritional value or provide resistance to particular types of disease can be used to genetically engineer food crops. See Genetically Modified Foods and Organisms for more information. With genome sequencing, fragments of chromosomal DNA must be inserted into different cloning vectors to generate fragments of an appropriate size for sequencing. See a diagram on constructing clones for sequencing.     If the low success rates can be improved (Dolly was only one success out of 276 tries), reproductive cloning can be used to develop efficient ways to reliably reproduce animals with special qualities. For example, drug-producing animals or animals that have been genetically altered to serve as models for studying human disease could be mass produced.     Reproductive cloning also could be used to repopulate endangered animals or animals that are difficult to breed. In 2001, the first clone of an endangered wild animal was born, a wild ox called a gaur. The young gaur died from an infection about 48 hours after its birth. In 2001, scientists in Italy reported the successful cloning of a healthy baby mouflon, an endangered wild sheep. The cloned mouflon is living at a wildlife center in Sardinia. Other endangered species that are potential candidates for cloning include the African bongo antelope, the Sumatran tiger, and the giant panda. Cloning extinct animals presents a much greater challenge to scientists because the egg and the surrogate needed to create the cloned embryo would be of a species different from the clone.     Therapeutic cloning technology may some day be used in humans to produce whole organs from single cells or to produce healthy cells that can replace damaged cells in degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's. Much work still needs to be done before therapeutic cloning can become a realistic option for the treatment of disorders.       What animals have been cloned?   Scientists have been cloning animals for many years.

49UxbESbaa	I'm not going to do your homework for you, but remember that all the angles in a triangle total 180.    So, when they want you to find the compliment, they want you to find the two number which will add to the first which will make 180.    So, for example in Q1, the first angle they give you is 12.  So for a, you go 12 + 68 + 158 = 238. Hence, a is not correct.    Keep going until you get to 180
w2nfvZ0caa	Optimization. You need to minimize the surface area.    There are two operative equations for this problem: the volume of a right cylinder and the surface area of a right cylinder.    V = r2h  A = 2rh + 2r2    They tell us that the volume is 12 in3. So we can substitute in "12" for "V":    12 = r2h    Now we can solve for either "r" or "h", and then find the other one later. I will solve for "h", because if you look in the surface area equation, there are two places where "r" is and only one where "h" is, so if you solve for "h" you only have to substitute once instead of twice:    12 = r2h  12 / r2 = h    Now, in the volume equation, wherever there is "h" we can substitute in "12 / r2". So now we have to find the minimums of the surface area equation (to MINIMIZE the dimensions):    A = 2rh + 2r2  A = 2r(12 / r2) + 2r2    Let's simply a little so taking the derivative will be a little easier:    A = (24 / r) + 2r2    Now we take the derivative and find the minimums:    A` = (-24 / r2) + 4r    Now I would find a common denominator [multiply "4r" by (r2/r2)] and add them together to get one fraction:    A` = (-24 / r2) + 4r3 / r2  A` = (-24 + 4r3) / r2    Now factor the top:    A` = [-4(6 - r3)] / r2    The critical points of this function are the numbers that set the function equal to "0" or make the function "undefined." So, there is obviously a critical point at "r = 0" (this makes the function undefined because of a zero in the denominator). This point doesn't matter, because the radius in the problem obviously can't be zero, because there can't be a cylinder with no radius! So, the other critical point is when you look at the numerator, when "r = 36" (this is approximately equal to "1.817"). Since this is the only other critical point, WE DO NOT NEED TO CHECK IF IT IS A MINIMUM OR NOT, SINCE IT IS THE ONLY RATIONAL ANSWER.    So, knowing the radius, we can go back to one of our original equations: "12 / r2 = h". We now know the radius, so we can substitute it in to find the height of the cylinder. Use a calculator:    12 / r2 = h  12 / (36)2 = h  3.364  h    So now you know that the final dimensions of the smallest cylinder you can make with the given constraints are when:    3.364 in  h  1.817 in  r    I REALLY HOPE YOU UNDERSTOOD EVERYTHING BECAUSE OPTIMIZATION PROBLEMS TAKE A WHILE. XD    Good luck! :)

JQqvohOXaa	There are three types of equations you can write for chemical reactions.  They are:  Molecular, Total Ionic, and Net Ionic equations.  NaBr does not actually react with water, H2O, but H2O dissolves NaBr producing ions.  Here's an example.    1.  NaBr(s)  --> Na+(aq) + Br-(aq) where NaBr(s) is solid sodium bromide.  Na+(aq) represents the positively charged sodium ion in water, and Br-(aq) represents the negatively charged bromide ion in water.  (aq) represents the water.    Usually you need to have a change in the reaction in order to wiite a net ionic equation.  Such as, the reaction between sodium bromide, NaBr, and silver nitrate, AgNO3.  I will write these in the three forms I mentioned above.    NaBr(aq) + AgNO3(aq)  -->  AgBr(s) +  NaNO3  - Molecular    Na+(aq) + Br-(aq) + Ag+(aq) + NO3-(aq) --> AgBr(s) + Na+(aq) + NO3-(aq)  Total Ionic    Ag+(aq) + Br-(aq)  -->  AgBr(s)    Net Ionic    Notice that the net ionic equation only contains the things that have changed between the two sides of the reaction arrow.  In the Total Ionic equation all of the ions are there including "spectator ions" and those species that change in the reaction.

Indeed change the parameter  (theta) in the article with    = t - /2, here t belongs to [0, 2], and the equations in the article take the above form. The curve is identical to Example k=4:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Epicyc...  but rotated at /4, so the four turning points (cusps) lie not on the axes, but on rays at angles  t = /4, t = 3/4, t = 5/4 and t = 7/4  (You can see how it is looking like, having some plotting software).  And You are right, to find them You need to solve simultaneously  dx/dt = 0 and dy/dt = 0, or  x' = 5(cos t + cos 5t) = (5/2) cos 3t cos 2t = 0  y' = -5(sin t + sin 5t) = (-5/2) sin 3t cos 2t = 0  That implies cos 2t = 0 and since t belongs to [0, 2], the above 4 values only satisfy the condition and the coordinates of the cusps are (22, 22).

9Wi2eNInaa	There is credence to the theory.    The two surfaces that break up during the trip create an arc and some of the material is deposited from one surface to the other a little more (at 60 cycles, it depends at what part of the cycle you break + or - and amplitude)    The point is, after that first break you don't have completely smooth surfaces anymore. So the next time you break an arc you are going to have a voltage current overload on the high pit deposits on the surfaces because the current is not distributed evenly anymore    But when those high pits get the extra current now THEY burn off and remelt on the opposite side, but at a different spot each time, depending on which spot offers least resistance     So conceivably you could count the pits and high deposits

So as you can see, you need to figure out which reagent is your limiting reagent (the lowest molar amount used). Once this is determined, multiply the number by the molecular weight of the product. This will give you the theoretical amount of product (in grams) that you should expect.    I noticed that you have listed the density of a starting material. To get the   of grams of this material you used from a volume amount, multiply the volume and the density. For instance, 3 mL of phenetidine = 3.195 grams...    Hope this helps!!!

KfBWOvf3aa	ok here is the simple explanation:    string theory suggests that our smallest building blocks of nature aren't pointlike particles, but strings. there is nothing smaller than this string. according to this theory, what we perceive as fundamental particles (which are electrons, muons, quarks, photons, etc), are none other than strings which vibrate with different frequencies. so, if string theory is correct, our universe is actually huge, remarkable, beautiful orchestra of vibrating strings everywhere. string theory is actually a very good candidate of Theory of Everything, which combines general relativity and quantum mechanics. btw if you really want to know string theory explained in simple language read the book "The Elegant Universe" by Brian Greene. or watch its movie. that is a really great movie/book explaining string theory in everyday language.|`|e08eab35a22f0c6bf7f5ba2c6c22c1f9aa	visit wikipedia and find out|`|gFYPJt8Laa	well you should ask my good friend Michio Kaku at his website  (he's the co-founder of string theory)  write him an email

2lQ8DJAcaa	More than 50 million years ago, a small, "weasel-like" animal called "Miacis" roamed the Earth. Most scientists now believe that this animal was the ancestor of today's domestic cats    Some scientists believe many modern bird lineages existed as long as 100 million years ago.|`|fl4BL2bgaa	i think the cat comes first.|`|lhiS83ojaa	Based on Wikipedia, which seems to have the most up-to-date information, the chicken (descended from the junglefowls of southern Asia) has a slightly longer record in domestication (>10,000 years) than the house cat (9,500 years). The cat date is based on a burial in Cyprus (an island where wildcats were not native), but it's unclear if the chicken date is based on direct archeological evidence from southeast Asia or inference from chicken remains in northern China (where junglefowl are not native) dating to about 8000 years ago. Either way, new archaeological evidence could change our understanding of these timelines.

sfkD5hR2aa	3/7+2/7=5/7  An easy one, just add the numerators together.    2/5+3/10=7/10  Still easy, but a bit harder. You need to make the denominators the same.

This makes the fraction -  4/10 + 3/10 = 7/10    2/3+3/4=17/12  As before, we need to make the denominators the same. 12 is a common factor between both 3 and 4, so we use this number (12) as a denominator.    1/4+1 1/4= 6/4  This is the same as 1/4 + 5/4    3 4/9+1 7/9=47/9  This is the same as 31/9 + 16/9.    4 2/3+1 1/12=83/12  This is the same as 14/3 + 13/12  The new fraction is the same as 70/12 + 13/12    Some of my answers are given as improper fractions (top-heavy fractions).

I know someone that was bitten by a brown recluse spider that was hiding in his boot. He nearly died.  I know that there are traps to catch them.  Go here to read about what can be done.  http://www.brownreclusespider.com/  or here:  http://www.brownreclusespider.com/faq.ht...  or here:  http://www.brown-recluse.com/spiderinfo....|`|pBA8nzfNaa	You can catch one by putting a jar over it in the corner but be warned these are very dangerous spiders.  They are normally not aggressive but if they feel threatend they will bite you!  Their name "recluse" is very fitting because they do like to hide.  Their natural habitat is one that is warm, dry, and comfertable.  They are more of an indoor spider and you probably won't see them often.  They like to hide and they are active at night.  If it bites you when you are trying to catch it you can look forward to a bite that kills that area of tissue and a big open sore for a very very long time.  Some people have problems for over a year!  Most bites are associated with people coming into where they are hiding out (like a boot, a pile of clothes, etc.) so be warned and please use caution.|`|xJrrI78faa	Not the best Idea, they are highly    potions your skin can rote away to a point if they bit you, but if you must know they are usually found in dark damp places. like under a house or under a trash can.

zYQFpJWNaa	While we do not "know" for certain, scientists are generally convinced that our universe began about 15,000,000 years ago with a very dramatic event, in which all of the mass and energy emerged at once. This event is called 'The Big Bang'. Before the big bang, nothing existed, not even space!     There is much too much to explain in a few paragraphs, but this expansion has continued until now, and it now appears that it will continue forever. More recently, we have observed that the rate of expansion of the universe is accelerating - is speeding up.    Since we have a good idea of he age of the universe, and an idea of how fast it is expanding, we do have some idea of its 'size', except even the concept of size gets a bit complicated.    Einstein theorized, and we have since found clear evidence, that mass warps( or bends) space.     If you think of a surface, like a piece of paper, you can easily imagine coming to an edge. But if you consider a surface like the surface of a sphere, you can see that you would be able to go on forever without finding an edge. We think the universe is like the sphere analogy. There is no 'edge'. But there is also no center, no special place, anywhere.  It is also large beyond imagining, but we are fairly convinced that it is NOT infinite! Just like the surface of a sphere is not infinite.    So where ever you were in the universe, things would look remarkably similar: you would see a very large number of galaxies in every direction, just as we do here on earth.    There is a book called, "Wrinkles in Time' that you might enjoy. it does not include the latest findings on cosmology, but it is a very well written and easy to understand book that can give you a real idea of what we have found out and how we have found it, about our universe.|`|EdNNmM7jaa	There are many different theories to this    1)  The universe is endless.  We have absolutely know idea what is happening out at the end of space but by chance, there is life out there.    2)  The universe is constantly expanding.  After the big bang the universe is spreading out.  There is a finite mass that occupies an ever larger amount of space.  Outside of the universe is nothing.  Life may or may not exist because the probability is low and we have no idea how much is out there.    3)  The universe is sphereacle.  Going in a straight line from one point will bring you back to the same point.  However everything will be backwards.  As before life may or may not exist.  Outside of the circle is nothing.  When coupled with the big bang, eventually everything will recollide at the end of the universe.    There are defineitly more theories, but those are the three I know well.  essentially, no one really knows for sure.
qBCGH52haa	1 percent is one one-hundreth of the amount.  Decimally, one one-hundreth is .01 (point zero one).  So, 8% would be equivalent to .08 of the number.  If you were finding twice his salary, you would multiply by 2 (which, btw is 200%).  To find the percent, you multiply the number by the decimal representation.  In this case, we will multiply $45,000 by .08    Doing this, we find $45,000 * .08 = $3,600    Thus, his new salary is his old salary plus his raise which is    $45,000 + $3,600 = $48,600|`|BwQe9au9aa	I am in the sixth grade and I got my calculator and put in 45000 + 8% and got 48600,but  I don't know if that is right or not.I am sorry if that is a wrong answer, but I hope you learn how to do %'s.|`|ovDqPtg8aa	45000 x 1.08  48, 600
NQLfzZ1eaa	Relative dating is where you know which thing happened first (the order of events)  but not the actual time in the past.  Where there is a section of sedimentary layers we know that the lowest one is the oldest and they get younger as you go upward so we know the relative ages of the layers but it is just a younger/older relationship between all the layers.      Absolute dating is where a radioisotope in the rock is used to tell the age in years.  If all the rocks had radioisotopes we could use that to tell the age in years of all of them, but many rock layers don't provide us with useable radioisotopes.       Aren't you glad I didn't say that relative dating is what they do in the Ozarks?
6kC9me0baa	EVERYTHING has resistance. Including the wires you used to connect your circuit, the leads of the meter, etc.    Also, the values for components are NOT ideal. What you think is a 1K resistor, is actually a 1k Resistor plus or minus 10%. So 1K might only be 900 ohms, or it might be 1100 ohms.      Basically, when you draw the circuit and calculate the resistance, you're assuming ideal values, which you just can't get when you actually build the circuit|`|85Y6DhJiaa	resistors have difference tolerance levels (1%, 5%, 10%) based on the color band (silver, gold, none).  So even if you have a 100 ohm resistor, it could be +/- 5% from 100 ohms.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	Nothing that is measured is ever exact. There are always errors.    Part of engineering is to have a good idea of what is a reasonable error (or accuracy) and what is not.    If you can give me a list of what your circuit was, and what the accuracies of the components were, I can calculate what you should have read when you made that measurement.    For example, resistors are usually 5%, sometimes 1%, and sometimes much more accurate (but expensive).    .
ozo8UbMeaa	Ok, frist off - genotype refers to internal genetic expression while phenotype refers to outside chracteristics that you can see.    Since B and T are codominant, neither can completely suppress the expression of the other, which is why your next generation will be mostly tabby.    Let's use a Punnett's square here. Separate out the gametes of the parents, and now cross them    _| B | B |  T| BT |BT  T| BT |BT    (You might want to draw that out, not too obvious here.)   Anyway, essentially, now all your four result boxes show "BT", which is  heterotypic, and because they are codominant, the phenotype will show both black and tan in the coat colour.    Phenotype and genotype ratios are the same (all results show BT (genotypically) and all F1 generation cats are tabby (phenotypically))    Hope this helped!|`|oExob6lxaa	Does not make any sense. Which one is dominant?|`|BgBT373Zaa	additive gene effect is shown|`|TAvbedDeaa	Well you did not mention the genotype properly. A cross between BB and TT would give BT which means 100% hybrid.

In certain conditions there is a probability of getting mixed types i.e. BB, BT, BT, BT, BT, BB, TT etc.(like the expt. done in primrose)

Man Toxicity   Dichlorvos was given orally to 4 separate 5-man groups at 1, 1.5, 2.0 and 2.5 mg doses. The 2.0 mg dose produced a depression of plasma cholinesterase to 71 percent of control two days after a 28-day feeding period. The plasma cholinesterase of the group given 2.5 mg daily was depressed to 70 percent of control after feeding for 20 days. There was no significant effect on RBC cholinesterase at this time. (Rider, et al., 1967).        The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies DDVP as a "highly hazardous" insecticide.    The EPA has determined that the worst-case scenario cancer risk to workers handling this chemical ranged up to 1/100 for exposures that amount to only a couple of weeks of work a year. This is when protective gear was used. The EPA has labeled DDVP as a probable human carcinogen. Acute symptoms include numbness, tingling sensations, lack of coordination, headache, dizziness, tremor, nausea, abdominal cramps, sweating, blurred vision, difficult breathing or respiratory depression, slow heartbeat. Very high doses may result in unconsciousness, incontinence, and convulsions or fatality. DDVP can bind to molecules such as DNA and is therefore suspected to be a mutagen.    By the EPA, there have been over 10 human deaths, eighty hospitalizations, and hundreds of fatalities to livestock and pets since the introductions of DDVP .    In some studies, people showed negative health effects with exposures of less than 1 percent of the recommended amount from the World Health Organization    If that classification sticks, that means DDVP is no guiltier of causing cancer than other less hazardous insecticides and can be safely used at home. Until the final word is out, extreme caution is advised when using products containing this chemical.    Compared to DDVP, permethrin may not easily kill insects.

5al0K3N0aa	Without the next servicing mission (ST-125; planned for May 2009), the HST will not get the boost to higher orbit that it requires to stay in orbit for the very long term.     Although the HST is thought of as orbiting in 'space', there is still a tenuous atmosphere at the altitude it orbits at. Thus friction with the atmosphere will decay the orbit until it re-enters the atmosphere predicted to be sometime between 2011 and 2032.     If this is the case, then the HST will make an unguided re-entry into the atmosphere. Parts of the main structure (particularly the breech end), and the main mirror would survive re-enrty and could strike a populated area. It has been calculated by NASA that there is around a 1 in 700 chance of human fatality if this happens.    Instead; on the next servicing mission, the astronauts will place a grapple handle onto the breech end of HST, and will boost the orbit whilst the HST is attached to the Shuttle. The grapple handle is to be used by an un-manned flight to HST where a propulsion module will be attched by a robotic arm. The propulsion module will then be used to drive HST into the Pacific Ocean. This way there is significantly less chance of fatality.     It's a shame it won't be bought back to Earth and displayed for everyone to see.|`|D5QgyGbXaa	It is in a low enough orbit that air resistance will slow it down, and it will go lower until it burns up.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	If at all, it will happen soon.

It is also not even sure, if the shuttle can land with the HST on-board at all, it is at the peak of the payload limits for return, and the return from 600 km altitude is also on the upper limit for the entry trajectory.    But there are really considerations to return it and place it into a museum.

lkNJNnlSaa	light independent photosynthesis can occur.|`|ToztjpAsaa	Don't put this in your test, but in some plants that live in hot, dry conditions it sort of does.    As part of the process of photosynthesis, plants have to transport gases through their stomata.  In hot, desert conditions a plant would dry out if it tried to photosynthesize normally because it would rapidly lose water through its stomata faster than it could replace it through its root system.    So an alternative process evolved known as Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) which allows the plant's stomata to remain shut during the day.  Check out the link for details.|`|QGSaSo6Jaa	no, it requires light (day)|`|05b4e14c99d9501231c3f4a12a609559aa	Not all of the light from the Sun makes it to the surface of the Earth. Even the light that does make it here is reflected and spread out. The little light that does make it here is enough for the plants of the world to survive and go through the process of photosynthesis. Light is actually energy, electromagnetic energy to be exact. When that energy gets to a green plant, all sorts of reactions can take place to store energy in the form of sugar molecules.     Not all the energy from the Sun makes it to plants? Even when light gets to a plant, the plant doesn't use all of it. It actually uses only certain colors to make photosynthesis happen. Plants mostly absorb red and blue wavelengths. When you see a color, it is actually a color that the object does NOT absorb. In the case of green plants, they do not absorb light from the green range.       PART II: THE CHLOROPLAST    Photosynthesis happens in the chloroplast. Within this cell organelle is the chlorophyll that captures the light from the Sun, but the chloroplasts are working night and day with different jobs. The molecules are moved and converted in the area called the stroma.       PART III: THE MOLECULES   Chlorophyll is the magic compound that can grab that sunlight and start the whole process. Chlorophyll is actually quite a varied compound. There are four (4) types: a, b, c, and d. Chlorophyll can also be found in many microorganisms and even some prokaryotic cells. However, as far as plants are concerned, the chlorophyll is found in the chloroplasts. The other big molecules are water (H2O), carbon dioxide (CO2), oxygen (O2) and glucose (C6H12O6). Carbon dioxide and water combine with light to create oxygen and glucose. That glucose is used in various forms by every creature on the planet. Animal cells require oxygen to survive. Animal cells need an aerobic environment (one with oxygen).       PART IV: LIGHT AND DARK REACTIONS    The whole process doesn't happen all at one time. The process of photosynthesis is divided into two main parts. The first part is called the light dependent reaction. This reaction happens when the light energy is captured and pushed into a chemical called ATP. The second part of the process happens when the ATP is used to make glucose (the Calvin Cycle). That second part is called the light independent reaction.   Some reactions only happen in light while others occur in dark.  Hope this helps.|`|QuUoDkBLaa	No, photosynthesis requires light to occur.|`|TUM8yGsLaa	photosynthesis itself does not occur no as their is no light.light independant reaction reaction i.e calvin cycle(breaking down of co2 into galp and then breaking down galp into carbs and rubp) occurs but only for a bit as supplies of atp and coenzyme nadp ,which are needed to reduce gp into galp, run out as they are supplied from light dependant reaction.peace.|`|I4uIOp1maa	no i dnt think so cos photosynthesis needs sunlight to work|`|VaoGZIPWaa	no, because sunlight is needed... :S    James, and good luck on your test :D|`|yzVGwQEwaa	In only certain situations.  The synthesis reactions in photosynthesis are light independant, meaning they could go on at night.  However, they`d likely rapidly run out of the energy required to do so.    Another possibility is sources of light that are not directly from the sun.  Some light does come from the sun, but it`s hardly worth mentioning in the context of photosynthesis.      Many plants survive indoors without ever getting a significant amount of sunlight, so artificial lighting, even at night, can keep a plant photosynthesizing.

If that is the case, you will need to have two things: A point and A slope.    The point is easy to obtain. First, take the y = 2 value and substitute it into the function to get the ordered pair location where your tangent touches the graph:    2 = (x)^3/2 + 1 -----> (1, 2)    Then, you will get the slope by taking the derivative of the equation. Y' represents the slope in general, but by plugging in x = 1, you can obtain the exact slope at that point:    y' = 3/2 x^1/2  y'(1) = 3/2 (1)^1/2    m = 3/2    Lastly, to get the actual equation, use point-slope form for lines and plug in the x,y ordered pair (from above) and the slope you just computed:    (y - y1) = m(x - x1)  (y - 2) = 3/2[x - 1]  y - 2 = (3/2)x - 3/2    y = (3/2)x + (1/2)    (Note: I had to edit my answer because I realized I'd originally plugged the Y-value into the X variable!

yzVGwQEwaa	That`s ridiculous.  Locusts would not be able to discern between first, second, third, or whatever born.  Besides that,  if they`re attacking people they wouldn`t care which was born first, they`d just care about consuming as much food as they can of the highest quality they can.    While I`ve heard of locusts eating the leather off of a seat on a tractor, I haven`t heard of them attacking people.  They`re vegetarians.  Army ants might be more worthy of your fear.

The probability that something might hit us "in the future" is never zero.  There is always some probability that something will hit us "some day".    The real question is, how probable is it.    This site shows the probability (and date) for each asteroid that comes close to Earth.    http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/risk/    The last column is the one of interest (Torino).  It combines the probability of collision with the potential of damage.  (Otherwise, we get asteroids hitting Earth almost every day, but most of them are small enough that they do not cause any damage).    When the Torino score reaches 4 or more, we get nervous.    Apophis is the only asteroid that ever reached 4 at one time.  But better observations showed that it would miss.  So it is back down to 0.    There is only one asteroid with something other than 0.  It is 2007 VK184 (a very poetic name, don't you think?).    On that table we find the following information (in order):    It's name 2007 VK184  (year of discovery, month, consecutive number in that month).    The date range of the closest passes (2048 to 2057) and the number of close passes during that range (4).    The cumulative impact probability written in scientific notation.  3.4e-04 means 3.4x10^-4 = 0.00034 = 0.034%  This is the probability when you add up the four passes.  If you click on that number, you find that it means 1 chance in 2,940 (which is the same as a 99.966% chance of missing).    The speed of impact (if it does impact) in km/s [multiply by 2250 to get miles per hour].    The absolute magnitude (the bigger the number, the fainter and smaller the asteroid) and its estimated diameter in kilometers:  0.130 means 130 metres = 425 feet.  Big enough to flatten a town and cause damage some distance away.  But not enough to destroy the whole human race.    Then the risk assessment in three different scale (the easiest to understand is the Torino:  less than 4, we are not worried... yet.  More than 0 means we will get more data to calculate a more precise orbit.    ---    If you click on the name of the asteroid (in the list above), you get the detail of all 4 passes, the first one being on June 3, 2048.|`|JYyOjAqdaa	Normally large celestial bodies impacting the Earth have cataclysmic effects.  Such as the last ice age (which, if you'll divert your attention to the glaciers and whatnot, you'll notice that were just coming out of it), the extinction of the dinosaurs.  Its a mathematic certainty that the Earth will be hit by another celestial body sometime in the future.    Its impossible to track every one of the millions of asteroids and meteorites travelling through the solar system.  Some of these objects' objects are so elliptical (ovular) that they travel beyond the orbit of pluto (meaning that the last time that we would have had a chance to observe these objects would have been about 200 years ago).  Dont worry, most of the larger ones have been accounted for, and we've even found some asteroids that are scheduled to impact Earth within the next 25 years, but im sure we'll take preventative measure to ensure the survival of our species.|`|a437a81a81df77e02521124f95502e21aa	All of the evidence seems to indicate that's -exactly- what whacked the dinosaurs (and about 70% of all of the rest of the life on Earth) about 65 million years ago.    The danger is that they really exist and they really are out there.  And we've had a few pass fairly close (within a million miles) in the last few years.    The bigger danger (to the majority of the half-witted fckmonkeys on this planet) is that someone will start predicting that it will happen in 2012 and everyone will shell out lots of money to buy their book(s) and videos about how to survive. ?

One about 200 million years ago is believed to have wiped out 90% of all life on Earth (Permian Extinction).  While these dates suggest such things don't occur too frequently, they are clearly a major hazard when they do occur.

The expanding Universe theory says that the Universe could expand forever [that corresponds to a 'flat' Universe]. And that is probably the model of the Universe that we feel closest to now. But it could also be finite, because it could be that the Universe has a very large volume now, but finite, and that that volume will increase, so only in the infinite future will it actually be infinite.  Professor Joseph Silk   Head of Astrophysics, Department of Physics, University of Oxford, United Kingdom       space is infinite and has no boundaries.    if space started out finite then it always remains finite.

For 3D animation/rendering, there is usually a dedicated GPU (graphics processing unit) that is capable of handling numerous matrix multiplications per second.  Matrix multiplication is the basis of all 3D transformations necessary for deciding what pixels appear on the screen.  3D rendering is broken down into transformations (position, rotation, scaling and perspective), texture mapping, bump mapping, pixel and vertex shading, lighting, motion blur, anti-aliasing and more.    In addition to the basics of the visual display, there is all sorts of math involved in the game.

pgYqsSOPaa	There are a lot of problems with your assumption we can just collect a bottle of electrons and condense them to a liquid! However if I treat your question as a 'gedanken' experiment it does highlight some interesting physics. Lets start with looking at Free Electron / Photon interactions. We know that free electrons will absorb/ emit any value of electromagnetic energy. We actually make use of this property in Free Electron Lasers (FELs). They can be tuned over a wide frequency range. When we combine this with knowledge of what the early universe was like before Decoupling of radiation and matter occurred, we can make a few plausible guesses. First your collection of electrons would appear opaque since they would absorb all incident photons. Also any photons emitted should cover the spectral range given by a black body radiator. Thus my suggestion is the colour you'd see would be given by the black body temperature of the electron ensemble. I would also expect the surface to exhibit the luster we typically associate with metals.  However we are are not going to be able to confine electrons in the manner you've suggested!|`|egwpSbttaa	A gas is made up of molecules comprised of nuclei and electrons bound together. If you were able to strip away just the electrons you would have plasma http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasma_(phy... not a gas.     The exact color of the plasma would likely depend on its precise pressure and composition and should in theory be able to "look" like any color, as it can emit electromagnetic radiation of any frequency.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	for something to have a color, it has to be visible to light. electrons are too small to be visible to light, so they have no color.    It's not possible to separate electrons from matter, not exclusively.    .|`|74952ed678a6ad90560f5a699c221b7caa	Filling a Leydon jar or a capacitor with electrons is easy to do.  Thus, far, no one has ever reported seeing those electrons, let alone their color.    Electro magnetic force (EMF) is the strongest of the four fundamental forces.  I doubt there is sufficient energy in our technology to actually squeeze free electrons into a liquid or, heaven forbid, a solid.  Can you imagine the forces of repulsion there would be as those electrons get closer and closer to each other?  We certainly have clouds of electrons, but that's about as far as we can go.    From the so-called Zeeman Effect, we know that electrons throw off their excess energies via photons (light).  And that light can be measured via spectrometers.  So as electrons transition to lower energy states, there would be emitted light.      Assuming squeezed electrons under extremely high pressure would be in energy excited states, I can visualize a sudden burst of light as they are released from the pressure and return to their respective normal energy levels.  But as the electrons would likely be in various excited states with different high levels of energy, the light emitted would consist of a wide range of frequencies (E = hf).  Thus, the burst of light would probably be white.|`|AA11295048	Electric blue.|`|EGNX4tuxaa	I think you are a little confused... Electrons don't have an assigned color.  The visible spectrum of EM is very small and all radiated EM comes from electrons.  When an electron is in an orbital around an atom and is excited/resonates by/with radiation it jumps up to a higher orbital.  The electron doesn't like to be in a higher orbital so it jumps back down and emits a packet of energy in the process.  This packet of energy is called a photon.  The photon is what you see as color.  If would be impossible to determine the "color" of an electron because of the lack of instrumentation.  You cannot take a picture of it because the act of taking a picture requires you to add energy (EM) to the system and thus altering your results.  To answer you question... Electrons don't have a color per say but have to ability to emit all the colors.|`|92f97d29e3d55f3219cc25dfabd347c7aa	I'm going to go with blue.

U51Lal1Raa	The differential equation is dy/dt = k(z-y)  where y is the temperature of the thermometer  and z is the external temperature  and t is time in minutes  and k is a constant.  dy/(y-z) = -k dt  ln(y-z) = -kt + C1  y-z = exp(-kt + C1) = C2exp(-kt)    Solve for C2 -- y0 at time 0  y0 - z = C2 exp(0) = C2  at time 0  So y = z + (y0 - z) exp(-kt)    Plug in 42 degrees at 3 minutes to get k  42 = 20 + (80 - 20) exp(-3k)  exp(-3k) = 22/60  -3k = -1.0033  k = .33443    If you left the thermometer outside:  y = 20 + 60 exp(-kt)  (equation 1)  If the thermometer were brought in and   the temperature were 71 at 10 minutes:  y = 80 + (71-80) exp(-k(t-10))  (equation 2)  (this was the hardest for me -- you're working  backwards from 10 minutes))  Now solve for the 2 equations for t.  20 + 60 exp(-kt) = 80 - 9 exp(-kt+10k)  60 exp(-kt) + 9 exp(-kt) exp(10k) = 60  exp(-kt) = 60 / (60 + 9 exp(10k) = .19044  -kt = -1.6584  t = 1.6584/k = 4.9589 5    (I wonder if I've missed an easy way)

HoZm5jadaa	From the given figure:  For the central angle you can label it as   For the inscribe angle you ca label it as      The rule : The central angle     The  central angle formed by any two points along a circle with the center point of the circle is twice the angle formed by a third pt anywhere along the circle(as vertex) to the same two points  but outside the confines of the first angle.     So no matter where you put point A on your figure angle A will always be half of the central angle as long as you dont pick on the included arc of the central angle.    Proof:   Put Pt C and Pt B along the circle to form a 90 deg central angle. That is quarter of the circle. Draw lines from both pts to the center.  now draw the diameter of the circle from Pt B passing thru the center of the circle. Where it intersect the circle call it Pt A  If you draw a line connecting A-C that line will be 45 deg from line AB. Which is half of 90 deg.--predetermined central angle.|`|AA11425571	You can say angle A or angle BAC  Angle C or angle ACO  Angle B or angle ABO  Angle O or angle BOC

8GVTQAg2aa	Here is your step by step explanation of the above problem :    5(r + 3) - r = -(r - 5) + 4r : original, if the 2nd step is correct    5r + 15 - r = -r + 5 + 4r : you clear parentheses by multiplying the number outside by everything inside. 5 times r = 5r ; 5 times +3 = + 15. To clear a minus outside a parenthesis, change the signs inside.  +r becomes -r ;  - 5 becomes + 5    4r + 15 = 5 + 3r : combine like terms. 5r - r = 4r ; 4r - r = 3r    4r - 3r + 15 = 5 + 3r - 3r : to get all r's on left, you subtract all there are on the right -- so you subtract 3r from both sides.    r + 15 = 5 : so the right side now has only a number, since the r's are subtracted away    r + 15 - 15 = 5 - 15 : Now, you subtract all numbers on the left to get only the r on the left. But you must also subtract on the right to keep the equation balanced.    r = -10 : the correct ending answer, since 5 - 15 is negative 10. (The difference is 10, the larger number is negative, so the sign is negative).|`|Q0jUU7A5aa	Based on the rest of the example, I think you have a typo in the first line.    What you have: 5(r + 3) - r = (r - 5) + 4r    I believe it is missing a negative sign on the RHS and should be:  5(r + 3) - r = -(r - 5) + 4r    The example you provided is a condensed solution.  I've included the intermediate steps along with an explanation for each step below.    5(r + 3) - r = -(r - 5) + 4r    In order to get the next line, you distribute the 5 and the negative.  5(r) + 5(3) - r = -(r) - (-5) + 4r  5r + 15 - r = -r + 5 + 4r    In order to get the next line, you combine like terms.  (5r - r) + 15 = 5 + (4r - r)  4r + 15 = 5 + 3r    Subtract 3r from both sides.  4r - 3r + 15 = 5 + 3r - 3r    If it helps to group like terms so that they're near each other, you can do that.  4r - 3r + 15 = 5 + 3r - 3r    Simplify both sides.  r + 15 = 5    Subtract 15 from both sides.  r + 15 - 15 = 5 - 15    Simplify to solve.  r = 10

v44KARaBaa	I would say your reasoning is correct. Cell membranes have "pits" that are formed by specific proteins waiting for incoming molecules to be transported into the cell by receptor-mediated endocytosis, some cells have more than others. These pits form the vesicles which these incoming molecules use for intracellular transport. During exocytosis, the vesicle then fuses with the plasma membrane again and releases its contents to the extracellular environment, that vesicle forms part of the cell's plasma membrane once again.

EuN4zRCLaa	The spring-mass system vibrates with frequency f, corresponding to an angular velocity =2f, given by:      = sqrt(M/k)  f = /(2) = sqrt(M / (3k)) / (2)    Where k is the spring constant, and the (1/3) inside the square root accounts for the effective mass M/3 of the modeled spring-mass system.  This gives two equations:    f = sqrt(M/k) / (2)  f + f = sqrt((M + M)/k) / (2)     We know f and f, but M, M and k are unknown.  However, we can estimate M+M to high accuracy as follows.    Take the differential to estimate the effect of a small mass increment:    d = [(1/2) / sqrt(M / (3k))] * dM/ (3k)   d = [(1/2) * sqrt(M / (3k)) * 3k/M]  * dM / (3k) = (1/2) * dM/M  d/ = df/f = (1/2) dM/M    So M/M ~= dM/m = 2df/f ~= f/f, to about as many significant digits as we know f/f itself.    This means that M+M is approximately 2*M*(11 MHz + 46 Hz)/(11 MHz).  Substituting this above gives two equations with M and k as the only unknowns.  Square both equations and solve.

pfxdLjBbaa	Steps for Determining an Empirical Formula:    1. Start with the number of grams of each element, given in the problem.    If percentages are given, assume that the total mass is 100 grams so that    the mass of each element = the percent given.    2. Convert the mass of each element to moles using the molar mass from the periodic table.      3. Divide each mole value by the smallest number of moles calculated.      4. Round to the nearest whole number.  This is the mole ratio of the elements and is    represented by subscripts in the empirical formula.    If the number is too far to round (x.1 ~ x.9), then multiply each solution by the same    factor to get the lowest whole number multiple.    e.g.  If one solution is 1.5, then multiply each solution in the problem by 2 to get 3.    e.g.  If one solution is 1.25, then multiply each solution in the problem by 4 to get 5.         Once the empirical formula is found, the molecular formula for a compound can be determined if the molar mass of the compound is known.  Simply calculate the mass of the empirical formula and divide the molar mass of the compound by the mass of the empirical formula to find the ratio between the molecular formula and the empirical formula.  Multiply all the atoms (subscripts) by this ratio to find the molecular formula.    --------------------------------------...    1. Pb= 59.37g  Cl= 100-59.37=40.63% = 40.63g    2. n=m/M  n = moles  m=mass (g)  M=molar mass (gmol^-1)    n(Pb)= 59.37g / 207.2gmol^-1 = 0.286534749 moles  n(Cl) = 40.63g/ 35.5gmol^-1= 1.144507042 moles    3. smallest moles=> n(Pb)=0.286534749 moles  Pb=0.286534749 moles / 0.286534749 moles =1  Cl= 1.144507042 moles / 0.286534749 moles = 3.994304517    so the empirical formula = PbCl4    molar mass/empirical formula=349gmol^-1 / (1 x 207.2)+(4x35.5)                                            = 0.999427262 approx 1    thus empirical formula is molecular formula  = PbCl4    hope this helps;-D

So they either have the form 2k, 2k+1 or 2k-1, 2k depending on whether the smaller integer is even or odd.  In the first case, (2k)^2 + (2k+1)^2 = 4k^2 + 4k^2 + 4k + 1 = 8k^2 + 4k + 1.  Since 8k^2 + 4k is clearly a multiple of 2, it follows that 8k^2 + 4k + 1 is odd.  The same argument works in the second case since (2k-1)^2 + (2k)^2 = 4k^2 - 4k + 1 + 4k^2 = 8k^2 - 4k + 1.    In fact, we have proven something stronger: the sum of the squares of any two consecutive integers is always one more than a multiple of four.  Maybe I should get the 10 points for doing even more than what was asked?

With it you should hunt for the Trapezium Cluster. If you will make it a hunt, go and find as many as 11 stars that make up the core of the cluster. The most massive member, Theta Orionis C is 40x as massive as the sun and more than 200,000x as luminous. If you go to Alnitak, Zeta Orionis, you will see below it the Horsehead Nebula. The 20 solar mass supergiant is also illuminating a couple of nebulae around it. Alnilam is also illuminating a nebula around it, though not necessarily ionizing it. Mintaka is a fine massive double. If you go to Iota Orionis, this massive eccentric pair is a product of great collision 2.5 million years ago. Lambda Orionis on the top is an open cluster which is somehow not related to the Orion OB1 but lies at the same distance. Bellatrix is a giant that just recently left main sequence. It has great ring of material around it. Betelgeuse, is a dying massive star. You will see a large ring of materials shed from past pulsations. It is a quintiplet but I think it is impossible to see the siblings from the glare of the primary. It is a member of Orion OB1 having received a mild kick since it was born. On long exposure photos, you will see Barnard's Loop, a probable supernova remnant that somehow encompasses most of Orion. On the foot of Orion are two supergiants both above 15 solar masses. The brighter Rigel is a triple though it is very hard to resolve the other two from the primary. To its side is a nebula illuminated by Rigel's astounding luminosity, the Witchead Nebula. To the right foot is Saiph, a star like Bellatrix that has recently left dwarfhood and is now 65,000x more luminos than the sun.

AsKWImpQaa	The Coriolis Force is the apparent force seen on moving objects due to the Earth's rotation.  It causes things that are moving to be deflected to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and the left in the Southern Hemisphere. If the Earth stood still then wind would blow directly from high pressure areas to low pressure areas, but the Coriolis Force deflects the wind so that it goes clockwise around high pressure areas and counterclockwise around low pressure areas in the Northern Hemisphere.  In the Southern Hemisphere the directions are reversed.    The Coriolis Force is a function of wind speed and the latitude, it is maximum at the poles and vanishes at the equator.  That is why no hurricanes form near the equator, they need the Coriolis Force to give them their spin.    It becomes insignificant for small distances and short time scales, so it has nothing to do with water going down drains in tubs.  Even the spin of tornadoes is not directly the result of the Coriolis Force.|`|70cf63c745874c449067b760725961e9aa	Coriolis force is an apparent force brought about by the rotation of the earth.This causes deflection of the wind to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere.This was explained in earlier days by the following illustration.  Start rotating the turn table of a gramophone.With a piece of chalk and a ruler ,draw a straight line quickly from the centre to the circumference..Stop the turn table.It is seen that the chalk line is not a straight line but a curve.  An apparent force causes the deflection in a sense opposite to that of the rotation of record.This apparent force is called coriolis force.This force varies with the wind speed and with latitude.It is maximum at the poles and near at the equator.  An air parcel is acted upon mainly by three forces.They are (1)the pressure gradient force(2) coriolis force and (3) centrifugal force due to the curvature of the isobars.  If the isobars(lines joining places of equal atmospheric pressure) are straight,then only the first two forces act and the resultant is called the geostraphic wind.This blows parallel to the isobars.  On the other hand,if the isobars are curved(as in the case of a low pressure system),the third force called the centrifugal force also comes into play and the resultant of all the three is the counter clockwise wind found in the low pressure systems like hurricanes and the clockwise wind found in the high pressure areas in the Northern Hemisphere.Thus the hurricanes get their whirling motion(which causes heavy damage) because coriolis force also acts on the moving air.  The three global winds,--The Hadley cell,Ferner cell and Polar cell in both the hemispheres have either north-easterly or south-westerly winds (instead of northerly or southerly winds) mainly due to this coriolis force only.

KfBWOvf3aa	the previous answer is correct, with the correct reason too. the answer is A. before released, the crate has same horisontal velocity like the plane. the action of gravity only accelerates crate downward, and does nothing to its horisontal velocity. therefore, the crate and plane always be in the same vertical line, until the crate hits the ground. this happens if there is no air drag. if there is air drag, the crate's position will be slightly behind the plane because air drag decelerates crate, but not the plane.|`|85Y6DhJiaa	A  no air resistance the crate keeps going the same speed as the plane.

Their sum must equal 196 ... find the two factors that will produce the greatest product when multiplied.  For example, if L= 100, W must equal 96 (so that their sum = 196, and their perimeter = 392).  Given L=100 and W= 96, A = 9600  The question is, is there another combination that will produce a greater product?  There is. There are two possibilities. It depends on whether or not your teacher will allow you to use   L = W = 98. This would produce an area = L x W = 98 x 98 = 9604 sq ft.  Of course, this is a square. A square is a rectangle ... however, if your teacher wants a rectangle whose length is greater than it's width, use L= 99 and W = 97. This produces an area = 9603 sq ft.     I hope that helps.

6e8af9deff7a2588bb4959771651cb16aa	It was diver 4 and he was ripped apart, ( atually having read the information again he did explode, sorry).  The survivor was one of two people, (tenders), outside of the bell who were helping.    The situation just before this accident was as follows: Decompression chambers 1 and 2 were connected via a trunk to a diving bell. This connection was sealed by a clamp operated by two tenders, who were themselves experienced divers. A third chamber was connected to this system, but was not involved. On this day, divers D1 (35 years old) and D2 (38 years old) were resting in chamber 2 at a pressure of 9 atm. The diving bell with divers D3 (29 years old) and D4 (34 years old) had just been winched up after a dive and joined to the trunk. Leaving their wet gear in the trunk, the divers then climbed through the trunk into chamber 1.    The normal procedure would have been: (a) close the bell door, (b) the diving supervisor would then slightly increase the bell pressure to seal this door tightly, (c) close the door between the trunk and chamber 1, (d) slowly depressurize the trunk to 1 atmosphere, and (e) open the clamp to separate the bell from the chamber system.    The first two steps had been completed and D4 was about to carry out (c) when, for some reason, one of the tenders opened the clamp. This resulted in explosive decompression. A tremendous blast shot from the chambers through the trunk, pushing the bell away and hitting the two tenders. The tender who opened the clamp died, and the other was severely injured.    Diver D4 was shot out through the small jammed hatch door opening, and was ripped apart. Subsequent investigation by forensic pathologists determined that D4, being exposed to the highest pressure gradient, violently exploded due to the rapid and massive expansion of internal gases. All of his thoracic and abdominal organs, and even his thoracic spine were ejected, as were all of his limbs. Simultaneously, his remains were expelled through the narrow trunk opening left by the jammed chamber door, less than 60 centimeters (24 inches) in diameter. Fragments of his body were found scattered about the rig. One part was even found lying on the rigs derrick, 10 meters (30 feet) directly above the chambers. His death was most likely instantaneous and painless.     Medical findings  Medical investigations were carried out on the four divers remains. The most conspicuous finding of the autopsy was large amounts of fat in large arteries and veins and in the cardiac chambers, as well as intravascular fat in organs, especially the liver. This fat was unlikely to be embolic, but must have dropped out of the blood in situ. It is suggested that the boiling of the blood denatured the lipoprotein complexes, rendering the lipids insoluble.  The rigor mortis was unusually strong. The hypostases (accumulations of blood in internal organs) were light red, and in two cases, there were numerous hemorrhages in the livers. All the organs showed large amounts of gas in the blood vessels, and scattered hemorrhages were found in soft tissues. One of the divers had a large sub-conjunctival bulla (a blister in the tissue of the eye).

BnR4LLhxaa	A fish is a good example of the law that says for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.  When a fish swim, it does so by generating a force against the water, some water is pushed away from the fish, but the fish is also pushed away from its starting point.  In space, there is no medium against which a fish could push in order to propel itself in a direction. People are not able to move about either, unless they have a means of propulsion (like a small thruster on their backpack), or some solid object, of much larger mass, from which they can push off.

AA11726869	Well, for this problem you will have to set up a system of equations.  Before we do that, though, we need to define a few variables.    C will be the pounds of cashews in the mixture.  P will be the pounds of peanuts in the mixture.    The price he wants to sell his mixture is $3.64 per pound, and he wants to make 10 pounds of it.  Therefore, we need to equations:    The first will add P to C to get 10, because the P+C must equal the total pounds of the mixture he wants to make, which is 10 pounds. So: P+C=10.    The second will need to take the price of each pound of nuts times the number of pounds of each nut, to get the price of the mixture times the number of pounds of mixture.  This will give the total price of the mixture, and will show how much each nut will cost in that mixture.  So:  $2.20P+$5.80C=$3.64(10).    All you have to do now is solve for a variable in the first equation, plug that into the second equation, and solve:    C=10-P  2.20P+5.80(10-P)=36.4  2.2P+58-5.8P=36.4  Solve for P:  -3.6P=-21.6  P=6 pounds.

Set each one = to 0 so that you get two answers: x= 5, and x= -3. Remember: when you have a quadratic equation like this, x squared, you will have 2 answers.   Good luck!
x384qQ3Iaa	I'm going to assume that you are familiar with modular arithmetic (like saying that 7 = 1 (mod 3)).  Also, when I write an equals sign there, I really mean that funny looking one with three horizontal bars that stand for "is congruent to" instead of "is equal to."  Anyways, the point is you need to find all n such that n^2-1 is divisible by 3, right? And similarly for the second part, you need all n such that n^2-4 is divisible by 5, right? In that case:<br>  <br>  1)  Notice that what you need is for n^2-1 = 0 (mod 3).  Well, n^2-1 can be factored into (n+1)*(n-1).  That means that either n+1 is divisible by 3, or n-1 is divisible by 3.  Therefore, we can write n+1 = 0 (mod 3) or n-1 = 0 (mod 3).  "Solve" for n, and you get that n = +/- 1 (mod 3), which is a pretty simple form. Another way to look at that though is to say that for any n not divisible by 3, n^2-1 will be divisible by 3.<br>  <br>  2) This is very similar to the first part, except that (n^2-4) = (n+2)*(n-2).  So by similar arguments you end up with either n+2 = 0 (mod 3) or n-2 = 0 (mod 3).  Again you "solve" for n in each case to get that n = +/- 2 (mod 5).|`|22oMednCaa	I think I get it.<br>  They want all the integers that can be used in each expression.<br>  <br>  The denominator of a fraction cannot equal zero (because division by zero is not allowed).

KHSOVxViaa	Oooo - there's a lot in that; you'll have to do your own research but I'll give you a few pointers.<br>  <br>  Usually if an astronaut is returning from space, the pod will be travelling pretty quickly; either in orbit or returning from further away.<br>  <br>  So, the objective is to go from high speed above the earth to zero speed on the ground or sea.<br>  <br>  The normal way would be to use the atmosphere for braking, hurtling through the air in a controlled or pre-arranged path.  Such braking causes a lot of heat because of the friction of the air, and the pod will glow much like a meteorite does.<br>  <br>  To protect the pod from this, it would normally have a heat shield of some kind.  This is just a thick insulating layer that protects the astronauts and pod innards from this heat.<br>  <br>  It's also important for the pod to enter the atmosphere at the right place and right angle, as the wrong place could mean landing far from where it's supposed to, and the wrong angle could mean burning up if too steep and fast, or skipping off the atmosphere like a skipping-stone on water if too shallow.<br>  <br>  If coming from orbit, the pod has to slow itself down to drop into the atmosphere.  If coming from further away, it still has to aim correctly to get the path just right.  This means it must have a rocket motor to slow itself from orbit, or adjust its path.  It also has to have navigation equipment and maybe a computer, so it knows where it is at any time, and can point and fire the motor just right.<br>  <br>  Of course, for the astronaut to be in the pod in the first place, it has to have a life support system.  This supplies enough air to the astronauts, and regulates the temperature to be just right.<br>  <br>  Finally, when the pod has slowed down through the air, it has to be able to land.  It will probably use parachutes to slow itself right down, and then use these parachutes and/or rocket motors to gently land on the surface.<br>  <br>  If this is on the sea, the pod must be designed to float safely until the recovery team arrives.<br>  <br>  That's pretty much it!<br>  <br>  To find out more, try goooooogle.....|`|PA7kYyAxaa	Your post is too broad.
z2hmLQDLaa	In order for an ODE to be separable, you have to have all the y terms and the dy on one side with the x terms and the dx on the other.  This won't always be immediately obvious, so in cases like these, you'll have to do some algebraic manipulation.<br>  <br>  In this particular equation, you may want to start off by adding -y^2 dx to both sides, giving you x^3 dy = y^2 dx.  Next, you'll want to divide both sides by x^3, giving you dy = (y^2 dx)/x^3.  Next, multiply both sides by 1/y^2 which will clear out the y^2 term on the right side.  This gives you y^-2 dy = x^-3 dx.  And that is, indeed, a separable equation which you can solve the usual way beginning of course by taking the integral of both sides.<br>  <br>  Also, I can't seem to find an integrating factor that is in one variable.  Just solve it as a separable equation--that's the simplest way to go about it.

f0ed2ce5d291634d748cb1ae9b52d651aa	1. The equation for a hyperbola with a vertical transverse axis is :  (y - k)^2 / a^2 - (x - h)^2 / b^2 = 1.  The centre is at (h, k).  The foci are at (h,  c), where c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)  The vertices are at (h,  a).  The asymptotes are at y - k =  (a/b)(x - h)    Given the vertices as (0, 6) and (0, - 6),   then centre is at (0, 0), so h = 0 and k = 0, and a = 6.    Given the asymptotes at y =  (3/4)x, then a = 3 and b = 4.    The equation is thus : y^2 / 9 - x^2 / 16 = 1    2. The vertices of an ellipse are on the major axis (through the foci).    Because the vertices are (0,  5), this is a vertical ellipse, with the centre  (h, k) = (0, 0) and the major axis length = 2a = 10, so a = 5.  The minor axis is given as length = 2b = 8, so b = 4.  The general equation of a vertical ellipse is : (y - h)^2 / a^2 + (x - k)^2 / b^2 = 1.    The equation is thus : y^2 / 25 + x^2 / 16 = 1.

I have always lived close to the city of Pittsburgh, and have occasionally heard them at night and early morning. I first noticed hearing them when I was a kid living in Ross township. It was so faint that I thought it was a dog barking, until I went outside and could hear it much more clearly!<br>  <br>  We currently live about 20 minutes north of Pittsburgh, and I only ever hear the owls for a few nights every winter, usually going into the early morning hours. Every once in a while I catch a glimpse of one at the top of my neighbor's spruce tree.<br>  <br>  The reason you often hear them calling a lot in the winter time is because they're establishing territory and nesting this time of year.<br>  <br>  And even though the great horned owls in this region are not really migratory, they do move around within their territory in search of nesting sites, partners, and food. So that's why I would only hear them for a few days at a time around my home.|`|5HhEeq5Gaa	This is the ideal time of year to hear owls.  They nest very early in the season, and I would expect that in the Pitt area, many/most are already sitting on eggs.  Calls can be for attracting mates and for establishing territories, hence this being a good time to hear owls.<br>  <br>  As for what species, hard to tell from your description.  You could go to <a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBirds/BirdGuide/" rel="nofollow">http://www.birds.cornell.edu/AllAboutBir...</a> and call up various owls and listen to their calls.  Remember that only a few of the owls listed are actually found in your area, so check out the maps so that you're not listening to species like the Whiskered Screech Owl that is found primarily in Mexico.  Also, you could give your local Audubon Society a call and ask them about your observation.  They might even have some local owling field trips to locate the birds, usually held just after dusk.<br>  <br>  It's fun to hear owls, and I hope that you hear this one again.

OQg7AOoWaa	A 45-45-90 triangle will have sides of x and x (legs) and radical2x, or x times the square root of 2.  So, if radical 2x = 4, then x = 4 over radical 2.  Since you can't have a radical in the denominator, multiply 4 over radical 2 by (radcial 2 over radical 2) to get 4 radical 2 over 2, which can be simplified to 2 radical 2.  So, each leg is 2 radical 2 (2 times the square root of 2) cm and the hypotenuse is four.  Since this is a right triangle, each leg is an altitude, or height of the triangle when the other leg is the base.  The formula for area of a triangle is 1/2bh.  It is easier to make 2 radical 2 the square root of 8.  So, 1/2 times the square root of 8 times the square root of eight = 1/2 times 8 equals 4cm squared.

UFteXlqwaa	Actually, an advection is an air movement parallel to the ground, from a high pressure to a low one. There aren't different "types" of advections.<br>  <br>  When the wind blows from the south, in the northern hemisphere, it brings, of course, warmer air from the south. In itself, it doesn't do very much other than warm up the air.<br>  <br>  You would typically see a southerly wind if you have a low pressure at your west and a high pressure at your east. You are then between the two systems, one spinning counter-clockwise and the other, clockwise.<br>  <br>  Things only start to happen when that air is moist, as when it comes from an ocean, then rises in the convection of a low pressure. That cools down adiabatically the air and clouds and precipitations happen.<br>  <br>  Cold wind doesn't bring necessarily clouds and precipitations, as you write. Wind coming from the north is often polar air and polar air is very dry because relatively colder. Northerly winds never bring much precipitations.<br>  <br>  The worst weather, wind and precipitation wise, is when very mild and humid air from the south meets above polar dry and cold air.<br>  <br>  How bad is the weather is not about humidity and temperature but the difference of those in two different air masses.
AA11157530	You are making a lot of assumptions in what you "know".<br>  <br>  Cold winds bring cloud cover and precipitation only if they have a source of moisture.<br>  <br>  The same can be said of warm winds.  They will bring cloud cover and precipitation if they have a source of moisture.<br>  <br>  Also, characterizing winds from the south as "warm winds" is based on an assumption of location.  Winds from the south are generally cold winds in South Africa.

This means that gradually more heat is retained by the atmosphere, leading to global warming. The ozone layer is damaged by gases such as Chloroflurocarbons (CFC's) which thins the ozone layer, or causes it to disappear completely in places (over the poles, generally).

2lQ8DJAcaa	Native American Astronomy <br>  <br>      During the past decade more and more evidence has surfaced proving Native Americans incorporated astronomy into many aspects of their way of living.  This evidence is found in ritual buildings, large earth burial mounds, and art.  Most Native Americans associated their lives directly to the earth and sky; they searched for meaning in the heavens. <br>  <br>       The most obvious sign of astronomy found in Native American life can be seen in the calendars created to keep track of time.  The calendars shows Native Americans noticed and kept track of the cyclic patterns of celestial events.  For example, the Papago Indians of Arizona divide their year by positions of an open star cluster in the constellation Taurus.  The time to plant is observed by the summer helical rising.  Zenith at dawn suggests the end of planting and past zenith harvest begins ( The First Star Gazers, pg. 23).  Likewise the Mayan Calendar was based on the cyclic pattern of Venus. <br>  <br>      Another important sign of the impact of astronomy on Native American culture can be seen in the architecture and the spatial order.  The beliefs of the culture are reflected in actions and buildings to complete harmony.  The ideal way to live, as believed by many cultures, is represented by the sky and celestial motions-in balance and always proper direction.  Examples of this can be seen in many different Native American groups.  The Oglala Sioux use 28 poles to erect their Sun Dance lodge.  This is related to the lunar month of 28 days.  The Mescalero Apache, upon entering their buildings move clockwise around the inside because the sun moves clockwise around the earth (Living the Sky, pp.299).  These are important examples to illustrate the importance of the celestial patterns on the Native American beliefs, morals, and overall philosophy of life.  The stars could represent past shamans or kings or dead council leaders and were looked upon with great respect for knowledge.

When the white dwarf had gotten 1.4 times as big as the Sun with the matter,  it would collapse in a supernova. <br>  <br>              Type 2 supernovae occur when a star much more massive than the Sun ends its life.  When the star starts burning out, the core of the star quickly collapses releasing amazing energy as neutrinos (a kind of particle smaller than an atom) and electromagnetic radiation (energy that is electric and magnetic).  The energy makes the star explode in a supernova.  The two types of supernovae also are different in the composition of material they toss<br>  <br>  Star clusters or star clouds are groups of stars which are gravitationally bound. Two types of star clusters can be distinguished: globular clusters are tight groups of hundreds of thousands of very old stars, while open clusters generally contain less than a few hundred members, and are often very young. Open clusters become disrupted over time by the gravitational influence of giant molecular clouds as they move through the galaxy, but cluster members will continue to move in broadly the same direction through space even though they are no longer gravitationally bound; they are then known as a stellar association, sometimes also referred to as a moving group<br>  <br>  Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) Red supergiant star, the second-brightest in the constellation of Orion.

uJPPxyewaa	Im pretty surprised that touchdown PCRs are still used. The idea is that you perform another heat shock right, but at higher temps. This could allow for the amplification. The reason it is not done predominately is because some DNA can not take that high of temps. The regular PCR temp is specific to whichever vector you are trying to amplify. Each vector/gene/plasmid/ or whatever you are trying to do a PCR on has a different heat shock point that is ideal for it. This is why I assume that they do regular PCR's. If you are doing PCR's on multiple vectors, then I don't know why you can't do touchdowns, but if you are just continually doing PCR on the same thing, like for research, the PCR temps are always the same because that is the optimal temp for that specific sample.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|mRG0W5Yxaa	I still do touchdowns on occasion, when I have a PCR that doesn't work as I expect.  The idea is to start at an annealing temp higher than you expect the primers to bind, then drop it by something like 2C every couple of cycles.  At some point, you'll get a small amount of very specific binding, which will give you some product of the right kind.  Even if you get some non-specific binding later, the thinking is that your first batch of correct product will keep you a couple cycles out in front in the product race.  See, you would do a touchdown when for some reason you're not sure where the optimum binding temp is.  Nowadays with gradient blocks you can just set up a test run the first time you do a particular primer/template combination, and then you have the information you need.

It'll cost, but you know you better than your doctor knows you.    The sugary food binge eating could have made you a type 2 diabetic or perhaps prediabetic, which would put your blood sugar levels off... fuzzy vision is a symptom that makes me lean towards this.    It could just be stress (brought on by worry, etc) too, because stress can cause high blood sugar, hypertension and a slew of other things to make you feel like crap.  So it could be a mix of several things without knowing what kind of tests have been run up to this point.    So, if it were me, I would want the doctor to look into some blood work.

tqAEoOAdaa	That's an easy way.Just know the countries and what their capitals are.Like for example lets take Argentina.The capital of Argentina is Buenos Aries and Brazil's capital is Brazilia and Chile's capital is Santiago and Capital of Peru is Lima.    Hint:-There are only 12 countries in South America and it is easy to memorize them all if you remember each one of them correctly.  Try to memorize one two at a time like first be thorough with say capitals of two countries.Then go to two three and finally all 12.Go ahead and Good Luck!

fYm2Q3LFaa	Igneous rock (etymology from Latin ignis, fire) is one of the three main rock types (the others being sedimentary and metamorphic rock). Igneous rocks are formed by solidification of cooled magma (molten rock). They may form with or without crystallization, either below the surface as intrusive (plutonic) rocks or on the surface as extrusive (volcanic) rocks. This magma can be derived from partial melts of pre-existing rocks in either the Earth's mantle or crust. Typically, the melting is caused by one or more of three processes: an increase in temperature, a decrease in pressure, or a change in composition. Over 700 types of igneous rocks have been described, most of them formed beneath the surface of the Earth's crust. These have diverse properties, depending on their composition and how they were formed.      Metamorphic rock is the result of the transformation of an existing rock type, the protolith, in a process called metamorphism, which means "change in form". The protolith is subjected to heat and pressure (temperatures greater than 150 to 200 C and pressures of 1500 bars[1]) causing profound physical and/or chemical change.     Sedimentary rock is formed by deposition and consolidation of mineral and organic material and from precipitation of minerals from solution.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Sedimentary rocks like chalk are formed by the gradual deposit of small particles, like sand or animal shells.    Igneous rocks like obsidian are formed by the cooling down of molten rock (ie lava or magma).    Metamorphic rocks like marble are sedimentary or igneous rocks that have been changed by a lot of time under intense heat and pressure beneath the ground.|`|zD7Gp7L2aa	You need to look at the rock cycle:  This is the way that all crustal rocks form, and that continental rocks are cycled.  There are some good web sites below.

rsTB7D1zaa	It actually has nothing to do with the oceans.  Consider that the sky is blue over Kansas -- which is thousands of miles from the ocean in any direction.  And what if there are clouds over the oceans but not Kansas -- shouldn't the sky turn black since we have lost the blue oceans??  This is just a bad theory.    Anyways, the light from the sun is all very random.  The upper atmosphere interacts with the light and ultimately ends up polarizing the light.  It does this by absorbing the sun's light and reemitting new photons, which will all carry the same polarization.  It turns out that this happens fairly evenly for all wavelengths that are visible.  But since blue is higher energy we predominantly see a shade of blue.  At sunset the sky may appear red -- this is due to the same polarization; it is blue somewhere else but because you have the source of light at such a far angle you end up seeing predominantly low energy light (red).      And the sky is green -- aurora borealis.  This is an interaction with ions in the atmosphere and the magnetic field of Earth / sun flareups (especially if the atmosphere is thin, like it is at the poles where aurora borealis can occur).|`|rQlzfHqraa	Sure  it could be green if the majority of the oceans there were green.

a1gZCkHYaa	Plants developed strategies to prevent ice encasement, frost heave, desiccation:    In extreme cold regions ( like Antarctica e.g. ) are all plant primitive and tiny and grow in rock crevices to be protected from the wind.    Herbs overwinter with their roots only, which are protected by soil and mulch or a blanket of snow.    Decidous trees remove their foliage. to prevent desiccation by transpiration, damage of their leaves by ice crystals and snow breakage.    Evergreen plants developed needle like leaves with thick cuticula and wax films.    A lichen is measured to photosynthesize at -20C.    Very cold hardy plants prevent ice crystals forming by removing potential nuclei from the cellular and intracellular fluids. Such fluids become in effect supercooled and can withstand temperatures as low as -40oF, without damage.    "A few high alpine and tundra species like Robbins cinquefoil can weather temperatures around -60oF (USDA zone 1) with a combination of supercooling and cellular dehydration that removes much of the water from cells that the ice needs to grow. Their cellular membranes, fairly flexible and resilien, enable such species to resist the thrust of ice crystals (think of them like self-repairing tires)."

6ieRX8lfaa	You need to know when they started dividing, and the rate at which the cells divide.  Then it's just a matter of creating an exponential growth formula to describe the divisions, then put in today's time to find the number of divisions.  For example:    If they started dividing yesterday (which I know isn't true, but it's easier to describe and won't change the process), and you know they split into two every 30 minutes, you can make the following formula to describe how many of them there are:    total=2^t    where t is the division interval, 30 minutes in this case.    Once you know how many of them there are, you can figure out how many divisions needed to take place the create that many.  This is actually easy to do.  Think about smaller numbers of them, then generalize.  For a single cell, there were no divisions, for two cells, there was one division, for four there were three divisions, for eight there were seven divisions etc.  This means there will be (n-1) divisions for n cells.    Now you can answer your question:  Take the starting point, and apply the change in time until now.  I started yesterday, and with 30 minute intervals there are 47 divisions since yesterday (not 48, because it doesn't divide at time 0), therefore there are 2^47 total cells.  This means there are (2^47)-1 divisions since my start.    Of course, there's a serious problem here.  This assumes none of the cells die during the time period, which maybe is a safe assumption for my time period, but isn't for looking at the start of life.  Instead, you need to find a better approximation that takes into account how long the cells stay alive and then remove them from the base amount.  For instance, if you decide they die out after 50 time intervals, then the proper equation is:    total=2^t-2^(t-50)      when  t > 50    That should give you a rough idea of the total.
z8xYANiJaa	To find the vertex you always put it into this form:    f(x) = a(x - h)2 + k    And the vertex would be (h, k) and the line of symmetry would be x - h = 0.    Your function is already in this form, but I'll make it even more obvious:    f(x) = 3x2 = 3(x - 0)2 + 0    Therefore, clearly, the vertex is (0, 0) and the line of symmetry is x = 0.    Hope this helps!|`|1WG0iCQWaa	The equation in vertex form is  f(x) = 3(x-h)2 + k, where  (h, k) is the vertex  axis of symmetry is x=h    In your case, h=k=0, so the vertex is (0, 0) and the axis of symmetry is x=0.  http://www.flickr.com/photos/dwread/3235...

YrOTZsjtaa	(a) Take south as negitive in y, and east as positive in x. So the speed of car?is 0 in x, and the speed of car? is 0 in y. From the law of conservation of momentum, the equation in x is:    p(i) = p(f)  0 + (1542kg)(12.0m/s) = (875kg + 1542kg)v(f)cos?  18504kg?m/s = (2417kg)v(f)cos?-----------> eqn.(1)    Now, in y:    (875kg)(-17.0m/s) = (875kg + 1542kg)v(f)sin?  -14875kg?m/s = (2417kg)v(f)sin?------------> eqn.(2)    Dividing (2) by (1), and recalling the trig identity sin? / cos? = tan?, you get:      -14875kg?m/s / 18504kg?m/s = (2417kg)v(f)sin? / (2417kg)v(f)cos?  -0.8039 = tan?  ? = -38.8?    Plugging this angle into (1):    18504kg?m/s = (2417kg)v(f)cos(38.8?)  v(f) = 9.82m/s.    You could put this in (2), and get the same 9.82m/s. So the collision results in the two cars moving at 9.82m/s at 38.8?south of east.    (b) After impact, the cars skid off as a single object with a  mass of 2417kg. The force of friction is :    F = mg  = 0.53(2417kg)(9.80m/s2)  = 12600N (take as negative, as friction works against direction of motion).    The acceleration may be found from :     F= ma   a = F / m  = -12600N / 2417  = -5.21m/s2    Then the distance is :    v2 = v?2 + 2ax  x = (v2 - v?2) / 2a  = [0 - (9.82m/s)2] / (2 x -5.21m/s2)  = 9.25m
EcGlXaYlaa	1) All sons would be healthy, all daughters would be carriers, yes.    2) If you have the 'h' trait then you do have it from your mother. Men cannot inherit it to sons. She is most probably a carrier, which means that either your grandmother is a carrier too or that your grandfather was a hemophilia sufferer. There may be women in her ancestry who were also sufferers but that cannot be determined by your status now. If she is a carrier, it is quite possible that she was never aware of it.     Reason: The hemophilia gene sits on the 23rd chromosome, the gonosome or X-chromosome. Women have two of them and can only inherit X-chromosomes.   Men have one X-chromosome and one Y-chromosome, which is mostly devoid of any genes. Men can therefore inherit either an X or a Y to their children, thus determining their sex.   When a gene on the X-chromosome is faulty such as in hemophilia, women have a second copy which fully compensates for the first, so they never know. Men don't have that 'backup'-copy so the gene always hits them.   Women can only suffer from hemophilia in the rare case that a hemophilia-suffering man and a carrier woman conceive a daughter.   This also explains why fathers cannot ihnherit it to their sons: By definition, they get the empty Y-chromosome and a normally healthy X from their mother. Also by definition, they inherit their one, faulty X-chromosome to all daughters.

Food, both dry and wet, were dropped on a surface, then they count the number of bacteria on the food surface.  They did it on a kitchen counter, the floor of a workshop and their toilet floor.

Regardless of that result, I still pick up food that had fallen on my table or sometimes the floor and eat it, unless my little niece is around.

The universe recedes as we study it, destined to disappear at the whim of time, space and the laws of physics. All that will be left are fading ghosts of distant galaxies, each an afterimage preserving a final moment as a swarm of stars slips into a netherworld of cosmic invisibility.  We've got less than 100 billion years left to study it all. And already, some galaxies are beyond reach, their potential inhabitants impossible to contact.  Accelerating problem  The end of the visible universe is rooted in the General Theory of Relativity and based on the notion that everything is expanding at an ever-increasing pace.  All distant galaxies are moving away from us and moving faster all the time. Few researchers debate this point. Eventually, galaxies will recede at the speed of light, making it impossible for their light -- or any other radiation or information -- to traverse the cosmos to our home in the Milky Way Galaxy.  Any given source accelerates away from us and eventually reaches a speed larger than the speed of light so that photons emitted from it cannot catch up with the cosmic expansion, relative to us.  Already, galaxies more than 6 or 7 billion light-years away are beyond contact. Such galaxies, measured by astronomers to have a red shift of 2 or more, will not be able to transmit any signal to us in the future due to the accelerated expansion of the universe.

They're giving you 2 distinct points on the function  T(30) = 150  T'(30) = 3    Find the derivative:  T'(t) = -ae^(-bt) * -b  = abe^(-bt)    Now plug the 2 values in  T(30) = 150 = 250 - ae^(-b *150)  -100 = -ae^(-150b)  100 = ae^(-150b)    T'(30) = 3 =  abe^(-150b)  dividing the 2 we get:  b = 3/100 = 0.03    Now solve for a.  100 = ae^(-150b)  100 = ae^(-150 * 0.03)  100 = ae^(-4.5)  a = 100e^4.5  a ~ 9001.713
TofmqjUaaa	it works if....    add 2  multiply 3  subtract 2  divide by 2    EXAMPLE:    2 + 2 = 4  4 x 3 = 12  12 - 2 = 10  10 .divided by 2. = 5    ...seee......    hope this helps|`|buLKwA1aaa	let x be the number    the steps are:    add 2 (x+2)  multiply by 3 (3(x+2))  subtract 2 (3(x+2)-2)  divide by 3 ((x+2)-(2/3))    it doesn't work because of order of operations. To make it work, you can do add, then subtract, then multiply, then divide.|`|QJWn3GWOaa	x  add two:  x + 2  Multiply by three:   3x + 6  Subtract 2:  3x + 4  Divide by three:  x + 4/3    The steps do not take you back to x, so the trick wouldn't work.|`|RS7wQ5pdaa	you just switch round the subtract 2 and divide by three because u have to do it in reverse order. because of BODMAS if your now what i mean. if u do this u get your original number.  hope this helps:)|`|vNOxGgasaa	well you can switch the order,  so i would be think of a number  add 2  multiply by 3  divide by 3  then subtract 2|`|Dley2oXaaa	When you state the operations, are they on that order on the page or are there parentheses:  Example:    it could be    (3(x+2)-2)/3 which would give X + 1.33    or simply    (x + 2 * 3 - 2 / 3) which would give X + 5.33    If you just want to know why it isn't giving you your initial number, its because you multiplied, but then subtracted before you divided. So your subrating from your product instead of from the quotient. Try to inverse the subtraction and division :).     Good Luck!
Sw0u2RD7aa	Yeah, it is safe.  I won't be as tasty as wild salmon but it doesn't contain any harmful chemicals.  They usually feed the fish antibiotics but they don't give them anything that is harmful to you.  However farmed fish usually lack the omega-3 fatty acids that are oh so good for you, stick with wild|`|2de65bc36b7dcb2a3fc726449ac3d0cbaa	no because the farmers put super harsh chemicals in them to make them big. that's why you should get organic ones they don't do anything to them exept let them grow naterally and feeed them special organic foods. i get my salmon at a grocery called whole foods.
H2qEN27daa	I believe they can. There was an episode of Dirty Jobs (i think) from Shark Week in which they tested dummies w/ different colored wetsuits on,  and the shark was very attracted to the bright yellow suit, while it almost ignored the black one.|`|GwEGiJmOaa	Yes. In fact, this knowledge may be used to make safer diving suits, for example.

eiim3tJuaa	For what I can tell from their site, you will have to pass the swim test and mic test. As well as being a trainer you are also the performer and educator for the public. The trainers are also the performer, they are the ones that teach, work with, and understand the animals, and they had to go through a process where they start off as "associate trainers, and learn about SeaWorlds training methods and animals in at least a one-year apprenticeship period".    http://www.seaworld.org/ask-shamu/faq.ht...  How do I become a marine animal trainer?    The following information is SeaWorld's basic job description, requirements, and background information on an entry-level animal trainer position.  ANIMAL TRAINER  Responsible for the daily care, feeding and maintenance of show animals. Develops and trains animal behaviors and performs in animal shows for the public and educational shows for school groups. An apprenticeship period of at least a year is required for all trainer positions, even with previous experience.  Our requirements for animal trainers include:   must be at least 18 years of age   prior experience training animals   public speaking, drama, or other performance and communication skills (a microphone test is part of the interview process)   experience working with animals   scuba diving certification   CPR certification   an ability to interact with the public   academic coursework in zoology, marine biology, animal behavior or psychology (preference is given to those applicants with a college degree)   strong swimming skills (part of the interview process is a rigorous swim test that includes a 200 ft. freestyle swim, a 100 ft. underwater swim, and a free-dive to the bottom of a 26 ft. pool.)   excellent physical health and the ability to lift 50 lbs.  In addition, even with previous training experience, new trainers are hired as associate trainers, and learn about SeaWorlds training methods and animals in at least a one-year apprenticeship period.    HOW TO GET EXPERIENCE  To try and see if a career in animal training or animal care is for you, SeaWorld offers a weeklong Career Camp for grades 9-12 during the summer at all three parks. Check online at SWBG-AdventureCamps.com for more information.  Many colleges and universities offer internship opportunities along with the local zoos or aquariums as part of a zoological science or similar type of degree program. Moorpark College in Southern California offers a special Exotic Animal Training and Management program designed for those who want to enter into zoological careers. In Florida, Santa Fe Community College and Pensacola Junior College offer similar programs. Volunteering at a local animal shelter, veterinarian, or wildlife rescue facility is another great way to get experience. In addition, many zoos and aquariums have docent or other volunteer positions available. It is also helpful to gain experience at the park or facility that youre interested in working for. At SeaWorld, many of our openings for trainer and animal care positions go to applicants that have worked at the park in another department such as education - so this is a great way to get your foot in the door.    Another thing to keep in mind is when position openings are available. At SeaWorld, we have most openings for trainers and animal care in the early spring, and usually post these positions on our website (www.becjobs.com) in late winter. During this time we hold the swim tests and microphone tests as the initial parts of the interview process.  As you can imagine, we get hundreds of applicants each year for trainer positions. For killer whale trainers there may only be one or two openings each year so this is an even more competitive area to get into. While a college degree is not currently required, those applicants that have a degree in marine biology, animal behavior, zoology, psychology, or related fields are almost always the ones that get interviews. Also, the swim test and microphone test are critical parts of the interview process. Most people who take these tests do not pass the underwater swim portion of this test, so it is critical to practice for this.  The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (www.aza.org) also posts career information and job openings on its website. We also have a lot more info on our website (www.swbg-animals.org) about training and other animal careers. Other great sites to check out are the websites for the International Marine Animal Training Association (www.imata.org) and the Society for Marine Mammalogy (this has an excellent section on pursuing a career in marine mammal science at  http://www.marinemammalogy.org/strat.htm    http://www.amysutherland.com/kbs-synopsi...  Chapter: Dolphin Dreams  pg 216  ...He tells them to get scuba- and CPR-certified, to join the International Marine Animal Trainers Association (IMATA), and to get a college degree. In interviews, he tells them, don't say you only want to work with dolphins. You may have to work with sea otters, even walruses, to get your foot in the door. Don't mention any spiritual connections you might have with cetaceans. "If someone says in an interview, 'I was a dolphin in a previous life,' uh, they're out of here," he says. Give yourself any edge you can, because "everyone wants to be a dolphin trainer. They'll kill you for it."...    http://www.swbg-animals.org/connections/...  How Do I Become an Animal Trainer    |`|Te153mNjaa	Yes.  A marine trainer at Sea World must swim with the animals in order to teach them new swimming techniques, and new "moves".
AA10927246	You have to split the function into two parts.    Notice when 3x-1 is positive, this is the same as:  y = 3x - 1    When 3x-1 is negative, this is the same as:  y = -(3x - 1)    CASE 1:  3x-1 > 0  3x > 1  x > 1/3    Here y = 3x - 1  y' = 3    CASE 2:  3x - 1   3x   x     Here y = -(3x -1)  y = -3x + 1  y' = -3    Note:  At the point where x = 1/3, you can't determine the slope.  It's where the line is switching from a negative slope to a positive slope.  We say that the slope is undefined at this point.    Answer:  For x > 1/3, y' = 3  For x   For x = 1/3, y' is undefined
O8qyhAegaa	That is a better question for the 'Earth Sciences & Geology' section.  Wikipedia would be your best bet in the mean time.|`|W2suykEtaa	its the blue stuff in Lapis Lazuli.    Lapis Lazuli has one of the funniest definitions in my gem book... "Lapis Lazuli is a rock."      who knew?    you see, a "rock" is a conglomeration of other materials together, sorta like Dick Cheney's pig-valve monkey heart.    Lapis has blue (lazurite) and white (calcite) and yellow shiny bits (pyrite) and white shiny buts (mica) and radioactive shiny bits (hornblende)...    no, wait... thats pitchblende.    nevermind.

EcGlXaYlaa	It depends mostly on the quality of the spilled oil. Heavy oil can sink to the bottom and suffocate all life there.   Lighter oil stays on the surface at least for a while, but even then some part of it will poison much of the life underneath.   Many of them will also die after a certain delay when they poison themselves by eating the oil-contaminated cadavers from animals that died higher up.
CYtMRC4eaa	A karyotype is a picture of an organism's chromosomes, and a genotype is a genetic description of an organism's chromosomes. Other than they both have to do with chromosomes, I can't think of any other similarity.
