You can do it manually (requires some practice and a good eye)<br>  - you also need to match the color balance, brightness and contrast to the real video. This is usually done in a compositing software (after effects, shake, digital fusion, toxik, etc.)<br>  - and most importantly: you need to 3D track the video, to calculate a camera path that matches the original camera. You need to render from this camera so your model fits in the video.

Multiple files would have multiple catalog entries, but a single file would need a "catalog" of some sort so you'd know where to break it into the original individual files.  So the answer is that either way *could* result in a smaller file.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to know which way would result in a smaller total package would be to try it.

M0cRnQ1Daa	First personal computer was invented by Steve Jobs and Steve Woznak in 1976. The first PC was an Apple computer.<br>  <br>  <><><><br>  <br>  The PC industry began in 1977, when Apple, along with Radio Shack and Commodore, introduced the first off-the-shelf personal computers as consumer products.<br>  <br>  <><><><br>  <br>  Personal Computers and microcomputers were made possible by two technical innovations in the field of microelectronics: the integrated circuit, or IC, which was developed in 1959; and the microprocessor, which first appeared in 1971. The IC permitted the miniaturization of computer-memory circuits, and the microprocessor reduced the size of a computer's CPU to the size of a single silicon chip.<br>  <br>  The invention of the microprocessor, a machine which combines the equivalent of thousands of transistors on a single, tiny silicon chip, was developed by Ted Hoff at Intel Corporation in the Santa Clara Valley south of San Francisco, California, an area that was destined to become known to the world as Silicon Valley because of the microprocessor and computer industry that grew up there. Because a CPU calculates, performs logical operations, contains operating instructions, and manages data flows, the potential existed for developing a separate system that could function as a complete microcomputer.<br>  <br>  The first such desktop-size system specifically designed for personal use appeared in 1974; it was offered by Micro Instrumentation Telemetry Systems (MITS). The owners of the system were then encouraged by the editor of a popular technology magazine to create and sell a mail-order computer kit through the magazine. The computer, which was called Altair, retailed for slightly less than $400.<br>  <br>  The demand for the microcomputer kit was immediate, unexpected, and totally overwhelming. Scores of small entrepreneurial companies responded to this demand by producing computers for the new market. The first major electronics firm to manufacture and sell personal computers, Tandy Corporation (Radio Shack), introduced its model in 1977. It quickly dominated the field, because of the combination of two attractive features: a keyboard and a cathode-ray display terminal (CRT). It was also popular because it could be programmed and the user was able to store information by means of cassette tape.<br>  <br>  Soon after Tandy's new model was introduced, two engineer-programmers-Stephen Wozniak and Steven Jobs-started a new computer manufacturing company named Apple Computers.<br>  <br>  In 1976, in what is now the Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak created a homemade microprocessor computer board called Apple I. Working from Jobs' parents' garage, the two men began to manufacture and market the Apple I to local hobbyists and electronics enthusiasts. Early in 1977, Jobs and Wozniak founded Apple Computer, Inc., and in April of that year introduced the Apple II, the world's first personal computer. Based on a board of their design, the Apple II, complete with keyboard and color graphics capability, retailed for $1290.<br>  <br>  Some of the new features they introduced into their own microcomputers were expanded memory, inexpensive disk-drive programs and data storage, and color graphics. Apple Computers went on to become the fastest-growing company in U.S. business history. Its rapid growth inspired a large number of similar microcomputer manufacturers to enter the field. Before the end of the decade, the market for personal computers had become clearly defined.<br>  <br>  In 1981, IBM introduced its own microcomputer model, the IBM PC. Although it did not make use of the most recent computer technology, the PC was a milestone in this burgeoning field. It proved that the microcomputer industry was more than a current fad, and that the microcomputer was in fact a necessary tool for the business community. The PC's use of a 16-bit microprocessor initiated the development of faster and more powerful micros, and its use of an operating system that was available to all other computer makers led to a de facto standardization of the industry.<br>  <br>  In the mid-1980s, a number of other developments were especially important for the growth of microcomputers. One of these was the introduction of a powerful 32-bit computer capable of running advanced multi-user operating systems at high speeds. This has dulled the distinction between microcomputers and minicomputers, placing enough computing power on an office desktop to serve all small businesses and most medium-size businesses.<br>  <br>  Another innovation was the introduction of simpler, "user-friendly" methods for controlling the operations of microcomputers. By substituting a graphical user interface (GUI) for the conventional operating system, computers such as the Apple Macintosh allow the user to select icons-graphic symbols of computer functions-from a display screen instead of requiring typed commands. Douglas Engelbart, invented an "X-Y Position Indicator for a Display System": the prototype of the computer "mouse" whose co|`|2LbTrlQnaa	The capabilities of the PC have changed greatly since the introduction of electronic computers. By the early 1970s, people in academic or research institutions had the opportunity for single-person use of a computer system in interactive mode for extended durations, although these systems would still have been too expensive to be owned by a single person. The introduction of the microprocessor, a single chip with all the circuitry that formerly occupied large cabinets, led to the proliferation of personal computers after about 1975. Early personal computers - generally called microcomputers - were sold often in Electronic kit form and in limited volumes, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians. Minimal programming was done by toggle switches, and output was provided by front panel indicators. Practical use required peripherals such as keyboards, computer terminals, disk drives, and printers. By 1977, mass-market pre-assembled computers allowed a wider range of people to use computers, focusing more on software applications and less on development of the processor hardware.<br>  <br>  Throughout the late 1970s and into the 1980s, computers were developed for household use, offering personal productivity, programming and games. Somewhat larger and more expensive systems (although still low-cost compared with minicomputers and mainframes) were aimed for office and small business use. Workstations are characterized by high-performance processors and graphics displays, with large local disk storage, networking capability, and running under a multitasking operating system. Workstations are still used for tasks such as computer-aided design, drafting and modelling, computation-intensive scientific and engineering calculations, image processing, architectural modelling, and computer graphics for animation and motion picture visual effects.[1]<br>  <br>  Eventually the market segments lost any technical distinction; business computers acquired color graphics capability and sound, and home computers and game systems users used the same processors and operating systems as office workers. Mass-market computers had graphics capabilities and memory comparable to dedicated workstations of a few years before. Even local area networking, originally a way to allow business computers to share expensive mass storage and peripherals, became a standard feature of the personal computers used at home.|`|HABoqbYOaa	It's a resolved question..

One problem can be due to scratch disk. It is really tuff. This is most probably because your C drive is almost full. It happens for me while I work with Photoshop(PS). PS takes some HD space as scratch disk, but there the advantage is tht I can specify the partition, tht the software must take. So if I have more space in D drive i can assign tht.<br>  2.) Next thing is tht you are working with a big video file.Here you have to free up your HD space for accomodating tht. Just compress the image files using winrar or other utilities. But this wont help much, jus waste of time. The best thing is to transfer all your files to a temperory dump, like your friends PC.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

SJM0rzHtaa	That video card will not work with your computer.<br>  <br>  The slot for video cards in the Inspiron 530 is a PCI Express slot.<br>  <br>  That Radeon 9500 is an older AGP video card and will NOT fit in a PCI Express slot.<br>  <br>  You can get an nVidia GeForce 9500GT though.  That will work with your PCI Express slot and performancewise it beats the crap out of the Radeon 9500.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|8nLuyDmPaa	all games should have a "OR BETTER" disclaimer.<br>  <br>  If you want/need a good card, find out what Video slot your computer has (Google your computer model and the word specifications, look at the video card type such as AGP, PCI, PCI Express) and then google the type of video card "AGP Video Cards".  There will be a lot to choose from.  Keep in mind, the most expensive one is not always the one you need.  Look for the one with the best numbers (RAM, speed) for the price.|`|wi90MOVSaa	Selecting a graphics card for your computer requires you to look at many requirements. Check your bus type (AGP, PCI, PCI-Express) on your motherboard. The most recent and fastest bus available would be the PCI-E (PCI-Epress) on your motherboard. If you bought your computer perhaps 2-3 years ago from a retail store, the motherboard should be using PCI-E.<br>  <br>  Games would usually not suggest only one brand of supported hardware. That would be bad for their business. I recommend looking at some Nvidia products instead of ATI due to the lack of support. I changed to Nvidia a few years back and I was certainly satisfied with the quality and support provided.|`|H3Va1OKqaa	You need to know if your motherboard is compatable with it.
7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Satellite internet (the technology) is bad.  Since your bandwidth is limited, you're not doing a lot of downloading, video watching or gaming, and your latency is terrible (the laws of physics can't be changed), so the only thing worse is dial-up.|`|BQsPZZfYaa	Satellite internet tends to be slower when downloading, much much slower when uploading, has high latency (so multi-player games won't work), and are unreliable. <br>  <br>  But if that's the only thing available, it's better than dial-up. <br>  <br>  How'd you post this, anyway?|`|L6BTDY9raa	I used to sell wild blue along with a bunch of satellite and voip packages.

HD7L65fXaa	You don't need separate variables for each of the secondary lists, each node in the primary list will serve as the head of each secondary list (via the Adj field).  But the Adj field should probably be a pointer (like Nuevo2).<br>  <br>  You shouldn't be using malloc in C++ code.  Sure, it can be made to work, but 'new' is the right way to do such things.  Learn about using 'new', it will simplify your dynamic allocations/deallocations.|`|77aae249cc7fcacbf1c3266dc78dd44baa	Why not add a boolean variable to one of the nodes to differenate it from standard ones? <br>  <br>  eg<br>  <br>  boolean headflag...or whatever, and set it to zero in the class constructor, or just modify the headflag variable to whichever datatype you could use to describe the structure
2SSA9e9Naa	Most wireless routers also have connections for network cable. I use a DLINK DIR655 to support both and have had no problems with it for over a year.<br>  <br>  Most of my friends and the tech people at work also use DLINK routers. They are readily available.<br>  <br>  Stay away from Linksys as they have a tendency to loose their network connection about once per week and you have to power them off and on.|`|T8G0wOXQaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Netgear is a really good one.<br>  <br>  Tigerdirect (web site) low price and good quality.|`|ufgSXIvOaa	Of course! That's what a router is! But there are 2 different types that home owners use. Wireless and Wired. Wireless is obviously wireless and you can use it to surf on your laptop, iPhone, iPod Touch, PSP, etc. And the wired is no wireless and this is usually recommended when you have multiple computers in one room. <br>  <br>  I highly recommend that you use Linksys. Any model by Linksys is fine right now. But I recommend the "WRT610N". Check out the homepage of this product.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/products/WRT610N" rel="nofollow">http://www.linksysbycisco.com/US/en/prod...</a><br>  <br>   You can buy it at Fry's Electronics, Best Buy, Circuit City, RadioShack, etc. <br>  <br>  This is how it works. You buy a router. You connect your DSL to the router and the router should have some open Ethernet spaces to plug in.  So you can connect your router to your desktop and you have to enter 192.168.1.1 in your browser and from there you set-up your wireless. Linksys is incredibly easy to set-up and to edit. But since you seem new to these router stuff, Linksys has provided a EASY software included in the box that will help you with your set-up along the way. Trust me and Linksys, you won't regret.|`|0QhlENUiaa	To use an internet by means of DSL is good. You must buy a usb wireless bluetooth for your wireless router and you can easily connect for both laptop and desktop.<br>  for any question text me 09196919437|`|6x7zV65Xaa	Hey hun,<br>  I have a NETGEAR router, works very well and I reccommend it!|`|5U7ZwKhXaa	That's what I did and I have a linksys|`|Z0iijxR6aa	Yes, you can use any wireless router as long as it has either two lan ports or one lan port and one wan port (assuming you want to keep your desktop wired as opposed to buying a wireless card for it).  You can either set it up to be a router and go from your current DSL router to the wan port on your new wireless router, or use it as a switch and go to a lan port (probably the former so you have more internal control over the setup).  I have had many wireless routers in my day (Linksys, D-Link, Trendnet, Belkin) and the best one I can recommend is the Apple Airport Extreme.  For me, the most important thing is connection reliability.  You will pay more for it but in my opinion, it is worth it.  However, if you are exceptionally concerned about wireless connection speed (playing games, etc.), you might want to try a D-Link 655 Xtreme.

The Lenovo S10 is getting good reviews among Netbooks.<br>  <br>  If you want a big screen, to do tasks that need more serious CPU or graphics power (big spreadsheets or high end games with a 1st person view), then you are not going to be happy with this.

It should be plugged into the back of your computer tower. there is a designated spot for printers. at least on mine. I hope this helped!

I84cekfHaa	The real YouTube videos are fine to watch, but worringly, these answerers seemed to be unaware of the danger of fake YouTube pages.  There is a tool which enables hackers to create fake YouTube pages which can surreptiously install malware onto one's computer.  This tool is called YTFakeCreator.  This tool allows cyber criminals to install malware and password-cracking services for sale to make money.<br>  <br>  These fake YouTube pages can only be spread by e-mail, FTP, IRC channels, peer-to-peer file-sharing networks or CD.  How it works, is by user intervention.  A user would come across a fake error message prompting a user to download a codec or a flash update in order to view a video, but instead that user will install malware.<br>  <br>  So, if you ever come across that, you're still safe only if you don't install.|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	No. Your just watching it.

Its worth a try though. <br>  <br>  Here are some sites that I found:<br>  <a href="http://www.joejoe.org/forum/lofiversion/index.php?t1973.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.joejoe.org/forum/lofiversion/...</a><br>  <a href="http://forums.techarena.in/windows-vista-performance/603289.htm" rel="nofollow">http://forums.techarena.in/windows-vista...</a><br>  <br>  I doubt it will work though.

Try to put it in the middle of where you expect to be (usually the middle of the house).  If you have 2.4GHz cordless phones you may want to replace them with 5.8GHz, 900MHz, or the new DECT6.0 phones that won't cause interference.  Also, wireless video senders, or wireless cameras that run on 2.4GHz should be set to the farthest channel from your router (e.g. set video sender to 1 or A and put the router on channel 11).  Channels 1, 6, and 11 are preferable because they don't "overlap" with each other.|`|9Kq6nWEDaa	Your laptop's built in WIFI card should work fine. The issue is WIFI does not travel large distances. Things such as walls and electronics greatly slow the signal, reducing the length you can access it from the router. Try walking around with your laptop, with the 'view available wireless networks' open, refreshing it every time you move to a new location. This will show you the signal(s) you are in range of, and their strength.

tYXf5388aa	A fragmented file is one that, when saved, is broke up into multiple sections in order to store it on your hard drive.<br>  <br>  Your hard drive is a circular disk within your PC.  Typically, data is written on the disk from the center towards the outside of the disk.  When you delete something from your PC, you may free up some space on one or more sectors of the disk.  The next time you create or save a file, it may save in the space that you deleted something from.  However, that space isn't big enough for it all so it saves some in that open space and then moves to the next open space.<br>  <br>  The more fragments a file has, the longer it takes to gather all of the pieces and open or access the file.<br>  <br>  Because of this, Windows has a Disk Defragmenter built in.  You should be able to access it from the Start Menu under Programs (or All Programs), Accessories, System Tools.<br>  <br>  Disk Defragmenter should be run every month or so and may take a LONG time to run if you haven't ever used it.  However, you should make sure that it runs to completion.<br>  <br>  You may be told that 15% free space is recommended.  You can still run it if you're unsure of which files to delete to free up any more space, but it will just take a little longer.  Additionally, you may want to run it two or three times in a row initially to allow files that did NOT get defragmented to have another shot at it.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	A fragmented file is one which has been saved to the first free area on the disk, but has been too big for the available space. So part of it gets saved further along the drive. If a file gets edited and becomes larger it may get saved in multiple parts, including later parts being stored earlier than its' beginning. This is not much of  a problem. Unfortunately over time, you will have most of your files stored like this, and then it slows the machine as the drive heads have to continuously jump backwards and forwards all over the drive for every file access. This is why the defragment tool was developed.|`|38c5fd804c63fc6903086ee0de7f76ffaa	fragmented file means its all over the place. When you hard disk is fragmented files are unorganized and your computer has to work harder and and longer to find files when you go to access them. By defragmenting your hard drive you are organizing the data on your hard disk to make for faster accessing.

RoMxIa1Jaa	I use and recommend Avast.<br>  It scans your email, has antispyware and anti-rootkit protection, and can be set to run a boot-time scan.<br>  <br>  However, although I don't like AVG, contrary to what one answerer said, and to the person who agreed, AVG certainly does give real-time protection (it's just not very good).|`|uuDloQnCaa	AVG version 7.5 was excellent used it for years myself but version 8 was a big disappointment, slow, buggy and most of the protection taken out, its basically no more than a resident scanner now, Avast is much better in many ways, read below for more info:<br>  <br>  Avast Home Edition: <br>  <br>  Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.<br>  <br>  Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key this is valid for a year after which you just register for another free key, so it always free.<br>  <br>  I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then big names like Mcafee.<br>  <br>  Avast: <a href="http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Comodo: <a href="http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/</a><br>  <br>  People often recommend AVG but Avast is far better:<br>  <br>  On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from “poison” webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.<br>  <br>  Everything AVG does not do: <a href="http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-virus-free-edition" rel="nofollow">http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...</a>|`|8Yd3UO0Baa	OK, we're talking the free versions here. Avast protects you in real-time from viruses, spyware and rootkits. AVG has no rootkit protection. Avast will auto-update the malware database and the program but there's no auto-scanning (except for the boot sector on start up and that's a pain), you have to initiate scans manually. Simply open up the GUI and click the 'Scan' button. Use Avast with a decent firewall such as Comodo and a back-up anti-spyware programs such as SuperAntiSpyware or Malwarebytes and you should be pretty safe. Never had any update problems with Avast and no false positives.|`|XW4pa8Pzaa	If we're talking free anti viruses, Avast is much better, it has real time protection unlike AVG. It needs less RAM, so it probably won't slow down your computer. AVG uses a lot of RAM and it doesn't even protect the computer. Avast has VRDB feature which allows to fix infected files, this could fix the problems caused by the virus after it's been removed.<br>  So after you reformat your computer get Avast. Good luck.<br>  <br>  lol, Lipi, here's a thumb up for you.|`|gtunOva2aa	Avast Home Edition for sure.|`|ZYSDJZUPaa	13 stole the words right outa my mouth.|`|t3xaSAnsaa	avast fast and reliable.

z46THMt8aa	A great color laser is the Samsunc CLP300. While laser toner is more expensive than ink, it lasts a lot longer. I am still on the original toners for my Samsung and it's been almost a year. A replacement set of all 4 cost me $70 at <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> and I haven't used it yet. I paid $80 for the printer. But it's not a multifunction.<br>  <br>  As someone who was in the computer hardware business for years (though I rarely sold printers since I couldn't compete with the crazy rebates) I have always recommended Epson. The print quality is excellent, even on plain paper. I have photos I printed on a 640 about ten years ago hanging in my office which still look good, though not as good as the ones from the CX8400 on glossy paper. The warranty is excellent. For a year, Epson will express-ship a replacement and pick up the old one. I had one customer who needed this. He called one afternoon and had the replacement two days later. Another client bought a Canon. It needed two repairs within a few months. Each time it was taken to the repair center, then picked up a few days later. This client runs a specialty printing business and this really hurt. They have since bought an Epson and have had no down time since.<br>  <br>  Epson has also made things easier for their customers by standardizing their cartridges. Most of their printers use one of two types. The three-color plus black use T069 (CX5000 CX6000 CX7000 CX7400 CX7450 CX8400 CX9400FAX CX9475Fax NX100 NX105 NX400 Workforce 30/40/500/600 and C120) and the 5-color plus black use T078 (R260 R280 R380 RX580 RX595 and RX680). This means you should be able to find a lot of people who use the same cartridges you do and possibly buy in quantity. When it's time to replace the printer, the next model will probably also use the same ones. <br>  <br>  Though I am quite happy with the results of the CX8400, if you really want the absolute best photo quality, go with one of the 5-color ones. Some of the models above include scanner and/or printing on DVDs.<br>  <br>  The biggest complaint about all inkjets is the high cost of ink cartridges. <a href="http://ccs-digital.com" rel="nofollow">http://ccs-digital.com</a> has cartridges for about $4.50 each. They also have a unique product - a two-piece cartridge where the ink is in a separate tank inside the cartridge. When the ink runs out, you replace just the ink tank and the original chip resets itself to full.  By keeping the same chip, you save 1.50 per cartridge. Ink tanks are only $3 and hold 50% more ink than disposable cartridges.|`|DulvxbYJaa	canon makes a good quality printer for the money,i would highly reccomend them.|`|AA10039500	Canon multipass is a very good printer & scanner You can buy<br>  ink cheep i have a cannon mp 390  and i give BCI-21 BK   $1.09<br>  BCI- 21 C $1.79<br>  You can buy your ink on line cheep at Bulk Inkjet Carts.com<br>  Just go to your Yahoo search bar if you have yahoo are any of your search bar and tipe in Bulk Inkjet Carts.com And search the first one on that page open it up and you can find the ink you want.

If you are new to programming and want to learn I would advice you to start with Java. Its a simple programming language to learn and once you are good at it, you can program with any other languages easily.   Java is object based so you can see everything you are doing.  The best compiler for java is Blue J. It comes with sample project which you can play with and improve them if you want.   Its free for download at http://www.bluej.org/    As well if you with you can buy the tutorial book which gives you step by step instructions into java programming. The book is known as   Objects First with Java; A Practical Introduction using BlueJ.    And remember in programming be patient and always start simple, then advance...     Good Luck!|`|AA11244076	I would recomend Microsoft Visual Studio Express Editions, not only is it easy to use but it is a very popular one used in industry.

If you actually need streaming then you are probably in the dedicated server territory. <br>  <br>  Similarly Java is mostly client based, so unless you actually need server side java AKA Tomcat then any standard host will do.  You do not need java on the server unless your application is written in java, simply having java in your web pages does not require a java server.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hostingscorecard.com/SharedLS-1.html" rel="nofollow">http://hostingscorecard.com/SharedLS-1.h...</a> lists the top ranked web hosts (in order) based on a minimum of 1000 user reviews/comments over the last 6 months.

So no need to worry about tht. <br>  <br>  Two:<br>  Battery would have no effects. it would run for longer time than what it runs in MAC OS cause Windows does not have that many graphics in itz design as much as they are in MAC OS.<br>  <br>  Three:<br>  Ur MAC would be little bit slow but it would be not much cause you are not gonna run both the OS together.  and when you are running one OS at a time all the memory is gonna be used for it and not the other OS.<br>  <br>  Four:<br>  For boot cramps in windows go to the start up programmes and let only drivers be there in that list and remove rest of them so that it wont take much time to load OS. Dont worry it wont create any problem to ur files. It would just show a pop up messege at starting windows that some programmes have been blocked by user. But it wont affect ur system.

7aHsYbcfaa	Yes, it will.  There may be complications though when it comes to games, instant-messaging, and file-sharing because the "rosewill" router will be doing NAT as will the Linksys one.  This is called double-NATing.<br>  <br>  One of the following would be preferable and eliminate the double-NATing issue:<br>  1. replace the Linksys with the Rosewill and be done with it (easier)<br>  2. configure the Rosewill to act as an access point (more flexable)<br>  3. set it up like you say, but put the Rosewill into the DMZ zone on the Linksys.  Then, use the Linksys for a guest-only network (public) and Rosewill as your private network.<br>  <br>  Note: if it doesn't have a "use as access point" feature, just set up wireless and then disable DHCP.  Then, connect from the LAN port of your Linksys to a LAN port of the Rosewill.  With this setup, there will be nothing connected to the WAN port of the Rosewill.|`|Dr9ACCzPaa	Yes it will, but why even use the g router? The n is totally faster! Once you connect the n to the g, that is the speed you will get!!!|`|BJxZ9DLOaa	Yes<br>  <br>  I have set up my 2wire router in bridge mode.

Then, after 24 hours, you can delete their entry from the table, allowing them to fill out the form again.<br>  <br>  If you are simply just trying to make the form work, realize that any time a person is entering that page, it automatically sets the cookie, no matter what they have done. This is because you indiscriminately set the cookie at the top of your page. Try setting the cookie after the user has sent a form.
m80e3y1Eaa	What OS do you use on your Dell? Your upgrading options for Windows are Vista or Windows 7 when it is released in its final form. Conversely, Leopard is a Mac-only OS. It is actually illegal to install it on a Windows platform. <br>  <br>  I'm currently looking into purchasing a macbook myself, but if you aren't in a huge hurry be aware that Mac's newest OS Snow Leopard is estimated to be released sometime this summer. <br>  <br>  I'm a huge fan of macbooks myself, but bear in mind the price: PCs are cheaper initially, but I've had too many problems with my last few computers (all Dells) and am planning on switching to Macs for this reason. However, you do spend more money upfront for them, since they start at $999.|`|3JJu3MIbaa	Well I've had a Macbook Pro for over a year and have yet to upgrade to Leopard.  I'm not sure how much faster it is, but it does have a lot of nice features that aren't found in OSX Tiger.<br>  <br>  You mention having a Dell Inspirion B120, but want to upgrade its OS to Leopard(?).  I know its technically possible to install Mac OS on a "PC," but it would probably cause more frustration than any actual benefit (Mac OS would be using a slightly different keyboard layout than your Dell would have, driver issues, etc)  <br>  <br>  However, If you meant upgrading your Dell (which would have come with Windows XP SP2) now, I wouldn't advise upgrading it to Windows Vista.  You'll definitely experience more slowdown then making it any faster as Vista uses up a lot of RAM and being inefficient in a number of ways.|`|fpzSNoVbaa	Dell would nt support all the features of MAC OS and u would have problem with drivers and softwares.

qUI8gvfzaa	Wow 2000 dollars? You don't need over 4gb of ram for multi-tasking. You need a Fast Processor. You should get a quad core cpu for multi-tasking because windows xp 32-bit only recognizes 3gb of ram. And i suggest building your own computer so you have the choice of upgradability later on. And you will save a lot more money. <br>  <br>  <br>  If you need any more help or advice about this e-mail me at pinoy_punker08@yahoo.com|`|QYPrM3GPaa	Well, $2000 is a LOT of money and that can buy a LOT of computer alright.  The question is, do you want to build it yourself or do you want someone else to do it for you?<br>  <br>  Newegg is really primarily for people like myself who build their own computers and do not go to Dell, HP or anyone else.  If you do not want to build your own computer, I would recommend contacting a local mom and pop computer store or a business center store and have them build a generic computer for you.  The cost to build, troubleshoot and test the computer should not exceed about $150 over the reasonable cost of parts.  I would figure a small markup on most parts because, after all, they are in business to make money.  The most important factor in buying a PC from anyone else is the warrenty.  Make sure whomever you go to, they have been in business a while, they are now in business and have a good reputation and will be in business.  These days, you never know when a business will just up and quit, right?<br>  <br>  You say you are not playing games, you just need good enough quality to do media center work with and some priate business work and those demands do not require that sophisticated of a computer to do.  I would say a computer in the $1000 - $1200 range is more like it.<br>  This will get you enough computer to do the media center stuff and even then, that is overkill for just simple spreadsheet and word processing work or writing emails and running outlook.<br>  <br>  You might consider a quad core Intel processor based computer, you have a choice of a Q processor or the new intel i7 processor.  The intel i7 is hands down better, about 35% faster than a Q processor like a Q9550, for example, both are quad core, both on a 45 nm technology, but the new i7 doesnot have a front side bus and it has improved communications between the cores.  <br>  <br>  You can build a Vista 64 bit Home Premium edition computer which can access over 4 gigs of RAM.  The Home Premium edition is the equivalant of the Media Edition of Windows at the XP level.  You cannot access over 4 gigs of RAM with XP or Vista 32 bit, so if having a lot of RAM means more than 4 gigs, you need a 64 bit operating system.  <br>  <br>  For a video card, I would go with nVidia cards because they have WHQL certified drivers.  Before deciding on parts, go to the Microsoft website and look for the Vista Compatibility List and make sure that all of the parts you get are listed here for video card, ethernet card, etc.<br>  <br>  Vista tends to be VERY fussy about drivers - and 64 bit MUST have signed drivers, not unsigned ones.  You might as well toss your old components unless they are recent ones.  It is best to go with all new parts on a Vista computer and make sure they all have properly signed drivers.<br>  <br>  Depending on how much "punch" you want for video, I would stick with at least a 9800 GTX+ overclocker card or go to the newer series GTX 260/280 cards (newest, is GTX 295 - but VERY expensive and overkill for you).  This provides you will adequate and sufficient computing power for streaming media, video/audio work, etc. and plenty of power for any business app.<br>  <br>  I would recommend the new i7 Core 920 processor which is reasonably priced at around $330 and a new motherboard from ASUS, but it does not have to be the "best" or an "overclocker" edition.  These mobos tend to be more expensive because the technology is so new.  Make sure that the board supports all DDR3 and get tri channel, I would get 2 sets of trichannel, each 6 gigs for 12 total gigs, 2 gigs per stick.  And I wouldn't take less than a 1 teribyte drive these days. <br>  <br>  Antec Power Supply or Corsair, at least a 650 Watt.<br>  Antec 900 II case, really cool and new!<br>  <br>  This is my recommendation for parts and operating system. I think you can get all of it for around $1200 if you do your shopping!<br>  <br>  Make sure you pick the processor first, then choose a mobo and then the other parts.  Download the motherboard manual from the manufacturer for the motherboard and start reading up on it.
dkpIjt5jaa	NTFS (New Technology File System) versus FAT32 (File Allocation Table 32-bit)<br>  <br>  Here are an excerpt from <a href="http://www.ntfs.com/ntfs_vs_fat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ntfs.com/ntfs_vs_fat.htm</a> showing the MAJOR differences between the two file systems.<br>  <br>  <br>  NTFS ( Used for NT, 2000, XP, 2003 Server and Vista )   <br>  <br>  Limitations:<br>  <br>  Max Files on Volume: Nearly Unlimited<br>  Max File Size: Limited Only by Volume Size<br>  Max Clusters Number: Nearly Unlimited                 <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  FAT32 ( Used for DOS v7 and higher, 98, ME and XP )<br>  <br>  Limitations:<br>  <br>  Max Files on Volume: 4194304<br>  Max File Size: 4GB minus 2 Bytes<br>  Max Clusters Number: 4177918<br>  <br>  <br>  As you can see, if you have files bigger than 4 GBs, you need NTFS<br>  <br>  Before you say that you will not have these sizes of files, just imagine that you need to "image" your OS and dependent files to safeguard against a crash, well it could become a "big" file like that.<br>  <br>  <br>  To switch to NTFS, the best way is to reformat, that is what I did with my two Western Digital 500 GBs before I used them.|`|jLb4PAreaa	The BIG difference is that FAT32 cant handle files over 4GB, that means that you cant have large zipfiles or images of dvds on it. I would never use FAT32 on a windows only machine.|`|3c97237894c9462cf25deb2e860485ecaa	well, if you bought a new harddrive, u can easily format to become NTFS in computer management in administrative tools.<br>  <br>  but FAT32 and NTFS is not much difference unless you are onto windows NT network or want to give specific file permission to your files or using client-server computing with windows 2000, 2003 and 2008 servers.. the life of the HDD will depend on many conditions. <br>  <br>  however, if u want to switch without any third party software, u have to format your new HDD, let's say drive E:, right click, format, and choose the file system as NTFS.<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|fEjiIcZYaa	As far as i know there isn't a difference except operating system support.  Vista has a program that will do it for you.  Right click my computer, click manage, double click storage, double click disk management, find your new disk, and format it with the wizard.  Please note that this will erase everything on that disk.  If you have xp or some other operating system you will need to get gparted.  you can download it here <a href="http://gparted.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://gparted.sourceforge.net/</a> it will also tell you how to use it.|`|GU7XqQCRaa	if your using win xp, go to command prompt. type in convert c: /fs:ntfs.<br>  once you do this theres no going back unless you use partition majic, and thats not always possible

Then I suggest you customized is as much as you can From Ibuypower or some other "adequate" PC building Company. Since Ibuypower allows for you to pick your case, motherboard, and memory (Company, and speed). <br>  <br>  Hope that Helps.|`|ssYUtrQ1aa	Whoa, and yes it is. Stick to a single, highest end card for time being and see how it handles. Get higher speed RAM. I wouldn't change anything else I think.|`|Rw1OfBLaaa	Yea it's good. You could save a good $500 though if you bought a lesser cpu and overclocked it.

6YufKn6Faa	GTX 260 is a whole different Chip. <br>  <br>  The 9800GTX+ is clocked faster in core speed and memory. However the GTX 260 beats the 9800 GTX+ in stream processing (more Processor Cores), memory BUS (448MB). The GTX 260 also has a higher memory bandwidth. This extra memory bandwidth and Memory BUS at 448MB allows the card to process, transfer, and use video memory at a much efficient rate. Then the GTX 260 also has extra processing cores allowing for more shaders, Texture map, and Render Output unit processing. <br>  <br>  This extra processing combined with the more memory bandwidth and bigger memory Bus, puts the GTX 260 out on top. <br>  <br>  And to see how they work together...<br>  There are always benchmarks. <a href="http://www.guru3d.com/category/vga_charts_crysis/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/category/vga_chart...</a><br>  <br>  Hope that Helps.|`|OIC0vsEWaa	GO WITH THE GTX 260!!!!!!!!!!<br>  <br>  no questions.<br>  <br>  the gtx 260 has much more memory as a well as a wider bus. this means faster transfer rates. it also has many more stream processors,<br>  <br>  clock speeds do not mean everything. the gtx 260s are very good products.<br>  <br>  don't count on the rebate. rebates through newegg are terrible to get straightened out.|`|lV95hMSiaa	The GTX260 is better as it has more Steam Processors & ROPS<br>  <br>  It would be a big mistake thinking the 9800GTX+ is better<br>  <br>  Heres a chart for call of duty 4 have a look you will see the GTX260 is way better.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.guru3d.com/category/call_duty_4_pc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/category/call_duty...</a>|`|jLb4PAreaa	The 260 uses a more favorable GPU.<br>  You will be happy with the purchase :)|`|oNcKWhoAaa	gtx 260 wins in every possibility, just go buy it now|`|SZQqsDNQaa	The 9800 cuz the 260 is just a lower end model of a next gen card series.|`|ssYUtrQ1aa	Go for the GTX 260 because it has the newer and better chips. <br>  <br>  I wouldn't get a 9800 GTX - if you go the 9800 route, get a basic 9800GT, it will be MUCH cheaper and will only be slightly slower.

A computer that will remain relevant for 5 years should have an Intel Core2Duo processor - 2GHz or higher... as high as you can afford.  4GB of ram or more and a terabyte hard drive.  it should have a dual layer DVD burner (commonly labeled as DVD+R DL) or a Blue Ray burner (Blue Ray burners are quite expensive as of now... you can upgrade later when they are less costly). The video card should have 512MB of ram ON THE BOARD... not a budget card that steals the system RAM to run...  You'lll end up with a Windows Vista OS but Windows 7 will be out somewhat shortly and it's quite a bit better than Vista - you'lll want to upgrade to Windows 7 when it's available...  what else... <br>  the RAM should be as fast as possible 800MHz or higher but its hard to find a stock system with specs like that listed... you'lll have to speak to a real person when buying.<br>  <br>  If i think of other things to list I'lll amend my answer

Instead, you become a licensed user — you purchase the right to use the software on a single computer, but you can't put copies on other machines or pass that software along to colleagues. Software piracy is the illegal distribution and/or reproduction of  software applications or fonts for business or personal use. Whether software piracy is deliberate or not, it is still illegal and punishable by law.<br>  <br>  Piracy comes in many forms. Here are some common piracy methods:<br>  <br>  Licensed user duplication for unlicensed users <br>  Illegal Internet distribution <br>  Illegal use of software over a network <br>  Distributing specialized education versions to unauthorized markets <br>  Distribution of inauthentic  software or fonts<br>  Sharing product installation keys<br>  Sownloading from pirate sites, etc|`|38c5fd804c63fc6903086ee0de7f76ffaa	You can't legally download ms office.

Hum??????|`|AA12149338	Hi!<br>  It doesn't matter what operating system you have, What matters is what the drive on the computer is capable of. Most can read and play DVDs. What you have to do is go to the "control panel", look for "system" and then look for "hardware" or "Device Manager". Step down to drives and see what they say about your DVD-ROM drive. Write down, or copy the drive information and paste it into the search bar on Yahoo or Google. That should get you a location with the specifications of the drive. By the way, when you are on the system screen, you will see all the information as to the operating system, memory etc.<br>  Good Luck,<br>  Joe|`|St1YwhE8aa	well you need to download a good dvd burning software like express burn and then you just drag and drop, that simple

zorYTX59aa	YOU DON'T NEED ANY DOWNLOADER. SOME PEOPLE ON YAHOO! ANSWERS <br>  ARE ACTUALLY DISGUISED SALESPEOPLE WANTING TO "SUCKER" YOU INTO <br>  BUYING THEIR BOGUS AND UNNECESSARY SOFTWARE --- which I find insulting <br>  since you cannot even access or watch videos.<br>  <br>  It looks like lots of people are asking about YouTube screens<br>  and players that are blank or all black. Thus, I recently spent<br>  2 hours googling, researching and reading multiple-dozens of<br>  help forums and threads. The best that I was able to surmise<br>  is that there is no definitive solution out there. However, there<br>  was one interesting factor in nearly everything I saw:...Firefox.<br>  <br>  A few people seemed to discover their own unique solution to<br>  this problem, but no one else was able to duplicate the same<br>  result. Also, each one of those apparent solutions was overly<br>  complicated and written in such bafflegab convoluted "techno-<br>  computerese" that I would not dream of recommending those<br>  potential fixes.<br>  <br>  However, I also did come across 4 somewhat easier possible<br>  solutions, so check these out:<br>  <br>  1) If you have a Mac and are using Firefox, apparently logging<br>  out of YouTube restores everything.<br>  <br>  2) One person found success by simply clicking the following:<br>  go to → Tools → Quick Preferences → Edit Site Preferences<br>  → Network tab → Browser Identification → Identify as Firefox.<br>  <br>  3) Three other people said all they needed to do was delete a<br>  program called "Gnash" (whatever that is).<br>  <br>  4) The last possibility is for you to double-check your internet <br>  connection if it's slow or weak -- because some people wrote <br>  that they always noticed "1 item remaining" in the bottom left <br>  corner of their browser screen.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but that's all that I can realistically recommend for you. <br>  If you are interested in researching this subject matter further,<br>  please feel free to type any of these into Google's search box:<br>  -- youtube "blank screen"<br>  -- youtube "blank player"<br>  -- youtube "blank box"<br>  -- youtube "black screen"<br>  -- youtube "black player"<br>  -- youtube "black box"<br>  <br>  If nothing above does your thing, let me suggest what I advise<br>  so many other folks when YouTube goes slow, stuck or weird: <br>  Clear your "cache" of its "Cookies", "History" and "Temporary <br>  Internet Files". What I call my famous "CHTIF triple-cure" has <br>  solved 100's of people's YouTube problems, so why not yours.<br>  Simply do the following, then shutdown and reboot:<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 6:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options <br>  → Delete Cookies → OK<br>  → Delete Files → OK<br>  → Clear History → Yes <br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Internet Explorer 7:<br>  → Tools → Internet Options > Delete...<br>  → Delete files → Yes<br>  → Delete cookies → OK<br>  → Delete history → OK<br>  → Close (browsing history window)<br>  → OK<br>  <br>  Mozilla Firefox<br>  → Tools → Clear Private Data<br>  [x] Browsing History<br>  [x] Download History<br>  [x] Saved Form and Search History<br>  [x] Cache<br>  [x] Cookies<br>  → Clear Private Data Now<br>  <br>  The only other ideas I can think of are Flash and Google Web<br>  Accelerator. The most recent versions of Flash are frustrating<br>  lots of YouTubers. Updates are typically good for only 1 thing: <br>  software conflicts.

Free too which is a plus. <br>  <br>  XP is fast, compatible with the majority of things, but for inexperienced users, there may be issues with keeping it "clean", adware, spyware, virus, worms, trojans, etc. <br>  <br>  Vista the second most compatible system, though it tends to run tediously slow unless you deactivate the majority of the systems memory hogs. Immune to all virus's though and relatively easy for new users. <br>  <br>  Mac OS is the easiest to use, though reliant purely on mac-made computers, so it's also the most priciest. It tends to be incompatible with most games, and many programs though this issue has been reducing lately. Best for people with extra pennies to spare and that wants a simple computer to use as it was catered to older-aged and new to computers audiences.|`|EHqA35O9aa	I'd personally suggest Linux as the overall best, it's Windows compatible in many cases, has great features, is shinier than Vista (CompizFusion) and has much software.

DQkBkkqxaa	----------------------------  Summary  ----------------------------  If you want to learn how to program, I suggest picking a language with a shorter learning curve. I actually suggest against writing an web page right out the gate due to the sheer number of things that you will have to learn all at once.    The trick to learning this stuff is to have patience, learn one thing at a time, and have fun!    ----------------------------  Learning a programming language  ----------------------------  As I mentioned before, there are so many aspects to learn about programming for the web that I don't suggest starting there if you simply want to learn how to program first.    It does not really matter what programming language that you start with but pick one and learn it.  Once you know one language, it will be easier to learn another; Keep in mind that programming languages are all similar but have different strengths and weaknesses.    I suggest grabbing this free book which teaches you how to think, in general, as a programmer without emphasizing the language too much.    "Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist" (pdf)  http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython...    You will then need to download the python program to your computer.  This program is called a "run time" or "interpreter".  This program will "understand" the commands you send it. It "interprets" them so that the computer knows what you mean.    Tip: use python 2.6 and not python 3.0      Python for Windows:  http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.6.1/p...    Python for OS X:  Python comes with OS X on the Mac.  Simply open the "Terminal" and type 'python' at the command prompt.    ----------------------------  Technologies for the web  ----------------------------  Note:  you will notice a lot of terms mentioned below.  The sheer number of them to learn is why I do not suggest starting with "web programming" in general since "web programming" means you will have to learn many things all at once.    HTML  This is not a programming language as many people think.  It is a "markup" language which is to say that it helps you lay out how you would like a web page to LOOK (markup/design to make a button "look pretty and be on the bottom of the page") but not how a web site should ACT (programming the button to "do such-and-such when it is clicked")    CSS  Once you are familiar with HTML, CSS can take a lot of redundancy out of the HTML to help you change the look of your web site more easily.    Server Side Programming Language  One you know how to get a web page to look like you want it to, you will need to make it ACT like you want it to by adding interactivity.  For example, making a button "do" something vs "looking" a certain way (HTML/CSS) This is where a programming language comes in.    Client Side Programming Language (Javascript)  If you're going to do web programming, you'll probably also need to learn Javascript.|`|AA10929108	there is tons of programming tutorials online all you have to do is google search "C++ tutorials" for example    a good site especially for web programming is www.w3schools.com    a great site for reading electronic versions of programming books is www.safaribooksonline.com but unfortunately it is far from free, it costs around $42 a month which isn't too bad considering most computer books cost around $40-60 each, and they have a great extensive library.    also you don't need to learn java to make games, in fact java is a dying language    if you want to get into game programming  you should look into C  and the XNA Framework  made by microsoft this framework will have you making xbox 360 games in no time|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Starting with a language is NOT good - start with programming (that's something you learn in English, it's methods of doing things, not codes).  Start with http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0... - that's the best book there is to learn programming.  It's possible to learn what's in the book in 6 months - it's not possible to becopme an accomplished programmer in 6 months unless you're a genius.    Once you learn programming, learn HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL - there are tutorials all over the web.  Then you'll have to decide whether you'll limit yourself to Microsoft servers (ASP runs only on Microsoft servers) or all servers (PHP runs on linux servers and can be installed on Microsoft servers) - and learn that or them.    Then you'll have to learn the client-server model, the document object model (the "DOM:"), probably AJAX if you want to do anything commercial, shopping carts, eCommerce, how web servers work, how to handle records for DNS, which web hosting company you should use for what type of site, ...    Figure about 2-3 years before you're really ready to start developing websites for clients.  (Oh, you'll also need to know the legal ramifications -  for clients, what happens if someone hacks a site and gets all the credit card information - for you, what your contracts should look like, etc.)|`|DF22BQ3yaa	I do not know if anything like this is offered online without enrolling in a school.

ja1NsNL1aa	It's not quite clear what's going on, but *if* you only want one checkbox checked at any one time, then include them in a group.  Then, when you check a box, the previously checked box will become unchecked.    When you add a group, make it large, then add the checkboxes: after you align them, you can reduce the group box size to fit.     You'll only need one field now instead of three, which takes the value 1, 2 or 3, depending upon which box is checked.    When you design a query, use the name of the group box to determine which box was checked.    Hope that helps some.|`|zmPuqU0zaa	It can be done, but depends on how you have set up your check boxes.

If you are making a gaming rig, you need to get a high end graphics card (around 150) if you don't want to keep on upgrading your computer.

8Yd3UO0Baa	SuperAntiSpyware *may* be better in that it possibly has more malware definitions in its database. Malwarebytes currently has about 1500 definitions in its database and is focused on the more recent crap.<br>  <br>  Both are regularly recommended by the specialist malware-removal forums, so both are good.<br>  <br>  Despite the names, xxxAntiSpyware and xxxAnti-Malware, both do pretty much the same thing. They can't really be compared with anti-virus programs such as Avast and AVG as they don't aim to catch viruses but will catch and remove malware that slips past anti-virus programs.<br>  <br>  The pay-for versions both run in real-time mode (they stop the crap from getting on your pc) so, like anti-virus programs, you shouldn't use more than one. However, the free versions are on-demand only, so you could install both, or have one pay-for version and the other as a freebie. Both are very good but, if you have a really good anti-virus program such as NOD32 or Kaspersky, that will stop most crap, so a freebie of either (or both) of these two is a useful back-up.|`|FCFdYuchaa	confirm<br>  <a href="http://download-antivirus-and-antispyware.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://download-antivirus-and-antispywar...</a>|`|HOq5Urn1aa	Both are very good and you should install them both.

8lx7EWivaa	Hi, there. I went thru the same thing a while back. The popup kept telling me I had a virus. It said I could download a free virus scanner. I hit the popup button. That was the biggest mistake I tell you. It scanned it and told me I had some viruses, but that I'd have to pay for the complete Virus Protection Program. I clicked out thinking it was over. Those things must be designed to be a bug itself. It kept dropping my computer. It would come back on but, it became very annoying. I tried to go into my programs to delete it but it was hiding. I asked a similar question here. Someone told me about a uninstaller. I googled it and went with the Revo Uninstaller. After loading it I went looking for it. That thing was hidden good. This uninstaller has a thing called a hunter. Its like a crosshair from a scope that appears on your screen. I had that thing ready. Soon as that popup came up I dragged the crosshair on it and hit delete. It wouldn't delete. I tried again and this time I hit Stop and Kill Process. Because it turns out that since I didn't download the whole thing, it wasn't a complete program, just part of it. <br>  So, becareful and don't hit anything. Download the free version of the Revo Uninstaller and pull out the hunter and shoot him in the head. See if that works. If that doesn't work, try getting an up to date Antivirus Program, see if will eliminate the popup problem.<br>  Good luck and hope to chat with you tomorrow.|`|BQS2bVjOaa	For all the info you will need on PC parasites, malware, spyware and Trojan viruses, you should check out: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pcthreat.com/removers.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pcthreat.com/removers.html</a><br>  <br>  Download the FREE infection scanner - and then follow the detailed instructions provided, on how to rid your system of the PC parasites embedded within.

What you're proposing is more of a band-aid solution.  You might think about getting a signal booster, or get your own wifi router that you can position where the signal is the strongest.  Honestly, I'd go wired (much faster) if your desktop is going to remain in the same place for a long duration.  Wireless is nice, but really can't compare in bandwidth unless you're willing to do some major spending.

Also, if you have a USB external drive with removeable media AND the media has been removed BUT there is a file in the list of "recently accessed documents" that WAS on the media.<br>  <br>  It may also have to do with a virus scanner checking recent documents that happen to be on removed media.<br>  <br>  What you must remember is that with a good BIOS ROM you can cause your system to boot from other than the C drive, but some scanner software doesn't believe that anyone would ever do such a thing.  So if you've been playing around with your BIOS config, you might have fouled it up a bit.<br>  <br>  The common theme is referencing a file during startup when that file is somehow on a removed media device.  Or having dynamically mapped device letters.  One entry even showed a hit on a smart-card reader that was USB-connected.<br>  <br>  By any chance is that failing mouse USB-connected?

Otherwise, you just have to try it and see.  (Let it download for a short time - 15 minutes, maybe, then stop it and start it again.)  The worst that can happen is that it starts downloading the same files again.|`|MP4Kp8hoaa	i wouldnt risk trying
YyOIbaVXaa	despite what most people seem to think, neither a Mac or PC is better than the other for anything (except gaming :P).  while the bundled software is better on a mac than a pc (ilife vs windows movie maker? no contest. wmm sucks), there are still equivalents for everything, open-source or otherwise.  the biggest deciding factors should be your budget and how else you plan on using the computer.  macs generally cost more and aren't good for gaming - not that they aren't capable, but not many developers make games for the mac - and PCs are cheaper, in general.<br>  <br>  i'd advise you to go for the PC, mostly because they're just as capable with video editing and other creative needs as a Mac is, and they are generally cheaper and compatible with more software.|`|ykXzzx65aa	PC<br>  <br>  macs are overpriced and undermade|`|4cMuedpWaa	Hard core video editing ? Mac Pro, period.<br>  <br>  iMac is still good but you can't really do Hard Core video editing (as in heavy video editing) as the hardware is nowhere near the Mac Pro.<br>  <br>  Yet, much better the iMac than a Windows Pc and to respond someone who knows squat about iMacs, yes, you can also upgrade an iMac (see the hard drive upgrade) if you actually know how to lift the Display glass.|`|bp2hibPTaa	it depends on what platform you want to edit on.<br>  <br>  do you want to use avid, final cut, or adobe premier. <br>  each of them have very specific hardware requirements. all of them are very valid editing platforms.. just depends on camera, format, and what your personal workflow is.<br>  <br>  i'd first decide what editing platform you wanted to use, then the pc.|`|PYF8cYtqaa	macs are for dum people. pc are for smart people and they cuz less and be configured the way u want them and there is alot to chose from|`|A2Ij0oVBaa	imac i love using imovie it is easy to use and great fun|`|gg4gUbWXaa	Depends. An iMac is not upgradeable, except for the RAM, which can only be expanded to 4GB. Mac OS is superior to Vista in almost every way, such as better RAM management, ease of use, and battery life on notebooks. However, Macs tend to cost more than PCs, but with that premium comes Mac OS, better build quality, award-winning AppleCare (free for 90 days), access to the Genius Bar at your local Apple Store if you have any problems, and less depreciation, resulting in better resale value if you decide you no longer enjoy your Mac. For video editing, the Mac Pro is best. Video editing programs unique to Mac include Final Cut Pro, Final Cut Studio, and Final Cut Express.  One thing that is great about Macs, is that you can now run Windows on your Mac, either using Boot Camp in Mac OS X Leopard, or a virtual PC program such as Parallels or VMware Fusion. Adobe makes Creative Suite for both Mac and PC, so essentially, you could run Adobe Premiere Pro either way, on Mac or PC. With the PC, you get more expandability options, modularity, and lower initial purchase price. If you do choose PC, you also get more choices in software, like video editing programs exclusive to Windows, such as Sony Vegas. So, in the end, it all comes down to your preferences: price, compatibility, expandability, support, etc.|`|NvwdFgzWaa	haha, Macs are better for work, only down side is if you ever have a problem with it not many people own them so you'll end up having to send it in for repairs and pay possibly hundreds. instead of having your friend do it for free.<br>  <br>  Macs are faster computers in general. better designed. But they demand conformity. 90% of the things you can get for PC you can not get for mac. Or you have to download addons to use them. <br>  <br>  Basically i prefer PC because its more versatile. <br>  Mac's run faster but if you plan on ever gaming then Mac's will let you down.
FBQZ06vraa	First, make sure you’re in Print Layout view.<br>  <br>  In Word versions prior to Word 2007 (Vista):<br>  <br>  1. Click the View->Print Layout menu item.<br>  <br>  In Word 2007:<br>  <br>  1. Click on the View tab on the Ribbon.<br>  2. Click the Print Layout button all the way on the left.<br>  <br>  If you're already in Print Layout view, I suspect you've accidentally turned off the inter-page display, which also turns off the headers and footers and the top and bottom margins.  Here's how to fix it:<br>  <br>  1. Find the solid black line between the pages or at the top of the first page.  <br>  2. Click it with the cursor.  (Double-click in Word 2007 (Vista).)<br>  <br>  That should bring things back the way you want them.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|0wUwKbHsaa	You probably have changed your view from Print Layout to Normal.

5RZxhiNCaa	uhm.... 192.168.1.xxx is an IP on your local network. Either a Computer connected to your Router by an Ethernet cable, or by wireless LAN.|`|T7Apky52aa	Are you running a wireless router by chance? The IP address 192.168.x.x is usually what you assign computers on a router so it's someone on your own system that's "hacking" you.<br>  <br>  If you're running a wireless router, you need to change your password and make it tougher to guess. Also take a look on Google for WEP/WPA encryption tutorials if your router supports that. Basically you want to lock it down as much as humanly possible.<br>  <br>  If you're not running a wireless router, then someone in your house is screwing with you.|`|wUqeZl3Saa	The 192.168.*.* IP address block is for local network use only. The 255.255.255.255 is normally a network address mask but it could be coming from a poorly setup proxy or router. As such, this could even be from your local area network (LAN).<br>  <br>  The guys at your ISP were probably LOL if you told them the same stuff you put here. That is assuming you connected to anyone that knows something. As it is, I'm having a hard time not LOL and the only reason I'm not is it is late here and I might wake someone up.<br>  <br>  If it is a known signature, Google doesn't turn up a thing. I have a few books on Trojans and their signatures, but that would take me a while just to find the books and even longer to look through them.<br>  <br>  If you did a trace route or similar, what was the IP just before the 192.168.1.64 address? I'm just going on the idea that maybe the router/firewall was open and it passed the trace to the actual computer. I've seen this happen before. The real address would be second to last.<br>  <br>  Also, having a computer open to the internet like this with no firewall could be bad. A worm or similar malware could be the culprit rather than a hacker. Someone with a poorly configured network could be a victim as well.<br>  <br>  Is your wireless connection locked down? Is there anyone else on your local network? This could be coming from inside your network. While we are at it, what is the IP address of your computer?<br>  <br>  If it really is from outside your network, you should be able to isolate it. Unplug the cable or phone line to the modem and see if it stops. If  it continues then it is on your local network.<br>  <br>  I don't have enough space here or time to give you an education on networking.

Then you should be okay to open it up in dreamweaver or whatever and edit it.  But you wouldn't be able to go back to iWeb later on then.  I don't think iWeb allows you to update/download from your server if you've edited stuff somewhere else.<br>  <br>  So basically just FTP into your server.  Drag and drop all of the files from the server to the folder you want on the new computer.  It might take a while depending on much stuff you have.

zorYTX59aa	Several times each day, YouTube shuts down a few of their <br>  servers to update stuff. Be patient if YouTube is slow, stuck<br>  or mangled. Transmissions from YouTube to your computer<br>  are done in multiple tiny packets of data and flash at a time. <br>  That's why sometimes you may get any of these scenarios: <br>  bits and pieces of text/thumbnails in weird places; sluggish<br>  loading/buffering; the spinning circle going on forever; or the<br>  player being blank. This problem could fix itself within a few <br>  hours or by the next day.<br>  <br>  If your YouTube continues to behave slow, stuck or strange,<br>  it's very possible that your directories of "temporary internet <br>  files" and RAM (sometimes known as "cache") are close to<br>  the maximum and just cannot take anymore, the end result <br>  being any of the above scenarios or videos that: A) come to <br>  a complete freeze; B) start/stop/start/stop in a choppy way; <br>  or C) never even make it onto your screen.<br>  <br>  "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get <br>  permanently put on your hard-drive. They will remain forever<br>  on your computer, gradually plugging it up like hair stuck in <br>  a sink drain, until you finally get rid of them once and for all. <br>  Thus, exit out of YouTube, then clear your "cache" of all its<br>  "temporary internet files", "cookies" and "history". It is best<br>  if you shutdown and reboot afterwards. You'll be amazed at <br>  how "fresh" and "new" your YouTube will be.<br>  <br>  Note 1: if you have got Google Web Accelerator or software<br>  similar to it....dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it; <br>  -- do everything you can to get rid of it.

You don't need anything else.<br>  <br>  Note 3: a strange fix that once worked for me was changing<br>  the website URL from "www.youtube.com" to "youtube.com"<br>  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|zghAUMmKaa	mahn...try d speed bit video accelerator..<br>  it may be the soln to your problem,.........

3swXWcxyaa	Well, what speed of internet connection do you have first of all? If your pc runs really fast when you are not on the internet you may need a faster internet connection. Either way these tips speed up all connections.<br>  1. Turn off phishing filter. Go to tools, phishing filter,turn off automatic website checking. This will speed up your browsing and you can still check websites if you wish.<br>  2. Turn off feeds (if you don't know what it is you don't use it.)<br>  Go to tools, internet options, content, feeds, settings, and uncheck all the boxes.<br>  3. Turn off cleartype. (You can always reenable if it is causing you problems.) Go to tools, internet options, advanced, and under multimedia uncheck "Always use cleartype for HTML*"<br>  If it causes you problems simply reenable it.<br>  4. Disabling the SSVHelper Class plugin. (It slows down some internet explorers) Go to tools, manage add ons, enable or disable add-ons, java tm ssvhelper class ,disable, reenable if it causes you problems<br>  These tips all apply to internet explorer for sure, I don't know about firefox. This last tip applies to all explorers though, although greater improvement is noticed on faster internet connections.<br>  5. Go Here: <a href="http://reliancepc.com/menu/tips/iemaxconnections/" rel="nofollow">http://reliancepc.com/menu/tips/iemaxcon...</a> to download a max internet connections tool. Basically what this download does is change your internet connections to any site from 2 to 16 (which is the max) so you can download ads, games, and other stuff on a site at the same time. (example ebay with a lot of images)Alls it does is change that value in the registry. I have tested this on my computer, my families, and my sisters and it has enhanced all of them.<br>  All these tips have greatly enhanced my browsing experience by about 20-30%. Enjoy!<br>  P.S.

Your speed between the router and your phone company is slower - how slow depends on the connection speed you're paying for.  From there out, no one has any control of the speed - you could be connecting to a very slow website, or one that's being overloaded (try to get to CNN when there's very important breaking news - or a tax preparation site on the evening of April 15).<br>  <br>  Connect to <a href="http://www.speedtest.net/" rel="nofollow">http://www.speedtest.net/</a> and see what your connection speed.  If that's close to what you're paying for (it might be faster), there's nothing you can do to speed things up - you're getting the correct speed all the way from you to the internet.  (The internet itself runs between 0 and 1mbps per connection.  It's completely controlled by the routers on it.  No human being has any control.)  It's like picking parents with better genes - the solution (picking faster servers that you have better connections to) would work if it were practical, but it's not.|`|er2VCmiCaa	Just so you know, adding RAM doesn't make your computer faster in some instances. Look, if you have 1GB RAM and your computer only uses 1/2 of that (on average), what is adding RAM going to do? I'll tell you, it wastes money. The best that it'll do is stimulate the economy. If you want to speed up your computer, <br>  1. "deleting temporary and unneeded files", <br>  2. and you should come up with something good. Also, use Disk Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup. If you think it'll slow your computer down more while you do it, yes, it does. But fear not, you should do it in the middle of the night. Start Disk Defrag, Virus Scan, and Disk Cleanup before you go to bed, and when you wake up, it should be done and almost always faster! Just remember, don't defrag every day. It can make things worse. Once a week or bimonthly is fine.

IGJGUfjNaa	If your virus/spyware free, there are  a couple things you can do get your computer working faster. If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.<br>  <br>  First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space. So, if you clean your registry, you make more resources available for speed. Do a registry scan if you got more than 20 errors you should clean it.<br>  <a href="http://www.delete-computer-history.com/what-is-the-best-registry-cleaner.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.delete-computer-history.com/w...</a><br>  <br>  2. Clear your Windows cache files, this is your temporary file. It can grow up to a large volume and stop your computer from using RAM properly. In a sense slow it down by preventing it from using free space.Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Quit Internet Explorer, Firefox, or any other web browser<br>  2. Click Start, click "Control Panel", and then double-click "Internet Options".<br>  3. On the General tab, click "Delete Files" under Temporary Internet Files.<br>  4. In the Delete Files dialog box, click to select the "Delete all offline content" check box , and then click OK.<br>  5. Click OK.<br>  <br>  3. Manage your startups. Your excess CPU usage is due to too many programs running in the background. You can cut these to barebones by alter your msconfig. Here is how:<br>  <br>  1. Open your Start menu.<br>  2. Click Run<br>  3. In the command screen type "msconfig.exe"<br>  4. In the "system configuration utility",click either "service" or "startup" tab<br>  5. Uncheck all programs that your are no longer using.<br>  6. Click "OK"

Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.<br>  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).<br>  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.<br>  3) Many more games<br>  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.<br>  <br>  Install at least Free Versions of Avira AntiVir, Avast, Comodo Firewall on the Vista.<br>  <br>  LINUX ADVANTAGES:<br>  <br>  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)<br>  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION.

Surf the internet and even run some windows programs with Wnehq/Crossover..<br>  <br>  LINUX OS<br>  If you are worried about viruses, spyware, security, Try Linux (it is free), I have included some information about Linux and links  so you are not lost if you decide to try it.<br>  <br>  Easily turn your system into a Dual booting computer with Linux, fast, safe and secure, easy to use (contrary to belief). You then get the best of both worlds (Windows with all of its supported products, freely go online without the worry)<br>  <br>  Installing Linux in general is very simple and much more secure than OS X(Macintosh) and free.<br>  Also, most Linux distributions have a LiveCD which means you can try without installing...<br>  UBUNTU, KUBUNTU, FREESPIRE, PCLINUXOS, etc.. all have live CDS.<br>  All you have to do is..<br>  A) to download .iso file off the internet from the Linux website<br>  B) burn the .iso file to a CD or DVD (Make sure your burning software can burn an ISO or get InfraRecorder <a href="http://infrarecorder.org/" rel="nofollow">http://infrarecorder.org/</a> )<br>  C) restart the computer with the CD in the drive<br>  D) As computer is restarting, press on F12 Key a bunch of times to get a boot menu<br>  E) Select the option to boot from CD or DVD.<br>  <br>  Click on this link and follow instructions up to the point of "Once the system has started up...", (the rest is how to backup windows) for an easy picture guide for steps A-E above <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer/" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-v...</a><br>  For easy instructions on setting up Dual Boot <a href="http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windows_xp_and_linux_xp_installed_first.htm" rel="nofollow">http://apcmag.com/how_to_dual_boot_windo...</a><br>  <br>  ANOTHER QUICK NOTE: People have been able to run OS X on a PC since the PC and Mac use the same hardware. This is not legal and I would not recommend it for security and legal reasons, the purpose is to show that there is nothing special about the MAC.<br>  <br>  A)Price...<br>  A similar equipped PC is much cheaper to purchase than Mac. Lets use Dell (but you can compare with another PC Brand if you like)<br>  <br>  **(LAPTOP)<br>  Dell Inspiron Laptop $849 dropped to $799<br>  15" Screen<br>  CPU: (upgrade to) 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo<br>  Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100<br>  Memory: 3GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM<br>  Hard Drive: 320GB Serial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm<br>  Optical Drive: Blu-ray Disc Combo (DVD+/-RW + BD-ROM) - WRITES DVDS,CDS, READS Blue-Ray Disks<br>  <br>  Macbook $1349 just dropped to $1224<br>  13" Screen (SMALLER)<br>  CPU: 2.1GHz Intel Core 2 Duo (SAME)<br>  Graphics: Intel Graphics Media Accelerator X3100 (SAME)<br>  Memory: (upgrade to) 2GB 667MHz DDR2 SDRAM (LESS RAM)<br>  Hard Drive (upgrade to) 250GBSerial ATA Drive @ 5400 rpm (SMALLER HARD DRIVE)<br>  Optical Drive: (DVD-ROM/CD-RW) - (Writes CDs, DVDs, cannot read Blue-Ray) (WORSE AND 1/2 SPEED)<br>  <br>  **(DESKTOP)<br>  <br>  PLEASE NOTE: I'm comparing Apple Mac's vs Dells best deal. If you decide that you must have an all-in one. The Dell all-in-one has more ram, wireless keyboard and mouse and equivalent to $400 for free making the Imac still more expensive when you upgrade the Imac to try to match. Personally I don't think the All-in-Ones are a good choice, and consider them overpriced, lack expandability and repairs both more expensive and require the entire computer.<br>  <br>  PS: Apple knows that they must make Macintosh look different than PC so all Macs except the Mac Pro will not have a tower option. Apple's low end lacks expandability but it makes the Mac "look different", if Mac had a tower for low-end, more people would realize the similarities between the two.<br>  <br>  Dell: (Right Now) Specs Below costs $809<br>  CPU: 2.4 GHZ Dell Inspiron QUAD (4 Processor) CORE<br>  SCREEN: 20inch Screen<br>  MEMORY: 3GB Ram<br>  HARD DRIVE: 500 GB hard Drive<br>  OPTICAL DRIVE: 16x DVD/CD Read/Writer<br>  GRAPHICS: (upgrade to ) ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB<br>  <br>  The Best Deal Mac is not the Mac Mini since it has no monitor, keyboard, mouse, very skimpy on options and setup... IMac is better price than the Mac Mini.<br>  <br>  IMac ($1400)<br>  CPU: 2.4 GHZ DUAL (2 Processor) CORE (SLOWER CPU)<br>  SCREEN: 20inch Screen<br>  MEMORY: (upgrade to) 2GB Ram (LESS RAM)<br>  HARD DRIVE: (upgrade to ) 500 GB hard Drive<br>  OPTICAL DRIVE: 8x DVD Reader/Writer (1/2 speed)<br>  GRAPHICS: ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO 128MB<br>  <br>  **END OF DESKTOP<br>  <br>  B) SECURITY:<br>  <br>  Mac OS X was hacked in 2006 under 30 minutes, and hacked within 2 minutes in a contest in 2008. Linux and Vista were not able to be hacked until another day when restrictions were lowered.<br>  All macs are standardized with Cameras, if your system gets hacked, the hacker would more likely be able to turn on your camera.<br>  Please Note: All OS's have vulnerabilities.<br>  <br>  C) VIRUSES<br>  <br>  The argument that OS X has less viruses is true,  but that is against XP, BUT Mac OS X has viruses (which is significantly on the rise), a friend of mine has a virused Mac. As more users use Macs, more viruses will come out for it. Especially when users think "they are safe".<br>  Viruses on Mac are rising significantly.<br>  <br>  Google/Yahoo Mac Viruses<br>  <br>  <br>  D) WINDOWS LICENSE is discounted with PCs<br>  <br>  You do not pay the full price, for instance Dell -> you pay $50 or less for Vista Home Premium If you buy a Mac and want Vista, you pay full price.<br>  <br>  <br>  E) EXPANDABILITY & REPAIR...<br>  <br>  Repairs are more expensive than PCs since the IMac, Mac Mini are compact units, and Apple charges a premium for their services. Some repairs can be done by another repair service but the compact design of the computer causes problems.<br>  With an IMac, if the problem is with the monitor, the whole computer would have to be brought in.<br>  IMac and Mac mini lack expansion.<br>  <br>  <br>  F) PROBLEMS<br>  <br>  Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts. OS X also has problems slowing down.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-quality-dwindling-my-macbook-pro-sob-story/" rel="nofollow">http://www.tuaw.com/2008/08/01/apples-qu...</a><br>  <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft-Finds-Irony-in-Mac-OS-X-Getting-Hacked-Before-Vista-SP1-82135.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://news.softpedia.com/news/Microsoft...</a><br>  <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-10020263-17.html" rel="nofollow">http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-100202...</a><br>  <a href="http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005" rel="nofollow">http://infosecurity.us/?p=4005</a><br>  <a href="http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives/2008/07/malware_authors_take_aim_at_growing_number_of_1.html" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/archive/poll_have_you_noticed_an_increase_in_malware_viruses_etc_on_your_mac/" rel="nofollow">http://www.macsimumnews.com/index.php/ar...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ubuntu.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.kubuntu.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kubuntu.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.freespire.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.freespire.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pclinuxos.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pclinuxos.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://distrowatch.com/" rel="nofollow">http://distrowatch.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://polishlinux.org/" rel="nofollow">http://polishlinux.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.desktoplinux.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://xwinman.org/gnome.php" rel="nofollow">http://xwinman.org/gnome.php</a><br>  <a href="http://xwinman.org/kde.php" rel="nofollow">http://xwinman.org/kde.php</a><br>  <a href="http://www.linuxalt.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.linuxalt.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/" rel="nofollow">http://screencasts.ubuntu.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPrinting/" rel="nofollow">http://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/OpenPr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.avast.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.avast.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.free-av.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.free-av.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/</a><br>  <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwitchingToUbuntu/FromMacOSX" rel="nofollow">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Switch...</a><br>  <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwitchingToUbuntu/FromWindows" rel="nofollow">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Switch...</a><br>  Google/Yahoo OS X on PC|`|Ew1bikkUaa	I am not aware of any.

It also has PhysX, which is good if you play games.<br>  <br>  All in all, if you want a better answer, please give more information, such as what you'll use it for, where are you living, and your budget.

At the top of the page, there are lists of links that will allow you to access more page commands. Click the “Tools” link located at the top of the page. It will automatically open a drop down list of menu options. Select the “Internet Options” link by clicking it. A pop-up window will appear with more settings.<br>   <br>  Step 2: Choose the “Security” tab by clicking onto it. You’ll instantly see several zones with various settings. Each zone represents a specific security level while browsing. Depending on the type of security level you choose, some have very low settings that will allow very minimal protection. A high-level zone will protect you most securely by blocking unfamiliar components. <br>  <br>  Step 3: Highlight the “Internet” zone on the “Security” tab. It’s an icon that looks like a globe or the Earth. In order to access the Active X controls, you’ll need to select the “Custom Level” button. Another pop-up window with more security settings will appear. These settings are grouped into various groups to make locating them easier.<br>   <br>  Step 4: Use the slide bar on the side of the page to navigate to the Active X section. It is labeled as “Active X Controls and Plug-ins.” By default, some of these settings are already disabled for the protection of your computer. Sometimes when you browse the web, there are multiple websites that hide spyware and viruses in multimedia components.<br>   <br>  Step 5: Change the default Active X control settings to “Enable.” Click the “OK” button to confirm the changes in your new settings. You’ll also need to select the “Apply” button on the “Security” tab and then “OK” again to apply these changes.<br>   <br>  Step 6: Restart your Internet Explorer browser window for the new Active X changes to take full effect. The Active X settings will not work properly without closing and then opening your browser window. After making these changes to your default Active X settings, you won’t be constantly prompted to download Active X controls each time you visit a website that asks you to. They will be automatically enabled for smooth access to the website. <br>  <br>    Hope this helps.  =)|`|C0ctHpPPaa	if you have internet explorer click the yellow bar up top and press allow|`|XEKNnAKoaa	Click the yellow bar at the top of your screen.Switch to Mozilla Firefox browser and active x will be a thing of the past and it's more secure.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu8lwF6JJVToBBwFXNyoA;_ylu=X3oDMTEyZW5xbmQ4BHNlYwNzcgRwb3MDMQRjb2xvA2FjMgR2dGlkA0RGUjVfNzc-/SIG=11ojm73t2/EXP=1235446000/**http%3a//www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox">http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0geu8lwF6JJVT...</a>

To get it off, you'll want to get an anti-spyware program (such as SpyBot), an anti-virus program (such as Avast!), and possibly an additional malware program (such as Malware Bytes). All of these programs are free, and will help keep your computer safe. I know Malware Bytes can remove AV360, and Spybot should be capable of doing it, too.<br>  <br>  If you have a paid virus program, I'd recommend dumping it for Avast. Avast is free and it's just as good as Norton / McAfee. (You do have to get a registration key for Avast, but registration is free.)

CRT monitors, however, are generally more affordable.<br>  <br>  LCD QXGA can support the highest setting|`|fna4b3Oqaa	mostly size. <br>  <br>  LCD's are easier on your eyes as they don't use a scanning electron beam to refresh the screen.... <br>  <br>  CRT's last longer but they're bulkier and quite a bit heavier than their LCD counterparts.<br>  <br>  When buying a monitor of any kind you need to pay attention to the dot pitch (.24 or less is good) and for LCD's the refresh rate.  The shorter the refresh rate (smaller the number) the more smoothe motion video will appear. High (slow) refresh rate monitors can show a ghosting effect on the screen.<br>  <br>  Depending on your job, LCD monitors might not be the best option - especially budget models.  The reason is simple.  Color reproduction accuracy.  LCD's have a wide range of color reproduction capabilities.  The biggest problem is the accuracy of the color they present to you.  The tone and vibrance can be way different on screen than would show up in print or on other LCD's or CRT's. <br>  <br>  If you're a graphic designer a budget LCD will not be a good choice for you... for the rest of us who only care if orange is some shade of orange we can recognize, cheapie LCD's are amazing.  You can get a 17" for 140 bucks... try beating that price|`|LThcbFoGaa	CRTs, obviously, are much larger than LCDs. Although they are based on much older technology, the benefits are that CRTs reproduce color more accurately and support a wider selection of screen resolutions. The downside is that they can cause eye strain when a low refresh rate is used.<br>  <br>  LCDs, on the other hand, generally support one resolution. While they don't produce color as accurately as an LCD, most users won't notice a difference. Plus, they don't cause eye strain. Unless you're a designer, I'd go with an LCD.|`|UYTdVcDkaa	LCD monitors have better picture quality, take up less space, use less energy, and are lighter (making them easier to move).  <br>  <br>  On the other hand, CRT monitors are generally less expensive.|`|AA10906001	Traditionally CRT have better resolution, but times are changing fast.  LCD is a lot lighter.  LCD is usually more expensive.  I would recommend LCD for most purposes.
NDep6pzyaa	The problem lies probably from the camera itself. The camera must have been set to record videos without sound.

I have lots of music, photos, files, etc. on my laptop and it's great.  However, I did maximize all the options when I bought it.

20B68c1iaa	If your computers are hooked up on a network, it might be a virus.<br>  <br>  It might also be a website you might frequent often giving the same virus to each new computer you have.<br>  <br>  I have never heard of people having an electromagnetic field strong enough to mess with computer electronics. If it was, you would notice distortion on the screen before the computer crashed.<br>  <br>  Could you describe the computers that crashed? Was it at a friends house? Are they of the same make? Have you made any upgrades?|`|TiX5Z4Zbaa	be careful which sites you open up.|`|3swXWcxyaa	If you access the same sites or your computers are networked it would be a virus. Try having someone use a computer far away from you, then slowly walk towards it, see if anythings happens. Probably just a freak problem but keep experimenting.

DDR3 can achieve higher bandwidth speeds at a lower voltage than DDR2 but DDR3 tends to have higher latency than DDR2.<br>  <br>  No, most motherboards do not support both types of RAM. However, some of the P45 motherboards support DDR2 and DDR3.|`|8uJPjJwXaa	Well as the name suggests DDR3 is faster than DDR2 and allows faster transfer of data between the motherboard and the ram or the graphics card.Mostly all the new motherboards support these .there are also new ones such as DDR5 for rams and GDDR5 for graphics card.|`|qeEyvLkmaa	1. ddr3 is improved version of ddr2.<br>      it has faster data transfer & lower power consumption.<br>  2.

pZwA7Ehyaa	1) simplest way is to insurt your windows XP CD rom or Ubuntu, boot from it instead of booting from your hardisk, to enable this you may need to go into BIOS and priorities which device it should boot from first. once you start the installation it will give you an option to wipe out your hardisk "format". but make sure to leave some unparitioned space for the other OS you may want to install.<br>  2) depends on what the OS partition supports, from my understanding i think Ubuntu can read your standard FAT parition but I am not sure about NTFS, on the other side I Don't think XP supports reading Ubuntu partitions. so keep at least 1 FAT partition for sharing of data.<br>  3) don't know the answer to that<br>  4) yes<br>  5) yes<br>  6) you have to check with Ubuntu support or your ipod support for that, it is possible they have a driver and software you can use. but that driver may not be on your ipod software disk, you can use AmaroK and Banshee to managed your ipod from Ubuntu, as itunes doesn't work on Ubunto ( <a href="http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/itunes" rel="nofollow">http://www.psychocats.net/ubuntu/itunes</a> )|`|jdctUYq3aa	Ok, so im guessing you want to install Ubuntu, and XP on the same hard drive, by using disk partitionning.<br>  <br>  To answer your second question, yes, you will be able to access your windows files, via the linux partition, however, in order to access your linux files from the windows partition, you have to use a third party program.<br>  One such program is WinSCP, which can be found at: <a href="http://winscp.sourceforge.net" rel="nofollow">http://winscp.sourceforge.net</a><br>  <br>  To begin the installation, you first have to burn the ISO file that you probably downloaded, to a dvd-r, as an IMAGE, NOT JUST AS A REGULAR FILE, or else the dvd wont boot.<br>  <br>  You have to use a program such as magicISO, if you want to burn an iso file as an image to the dvd.<br>  <br>  After you begin the linux installation, you should come to a menu, which lets you erase your whole hard drive, and/or create partitions, or select in which partition you want to install linux. So in this case, you will want to erase your whole hard drive, and create a partition of a specific size, where you will install linux.<br>  <br>  After the linux installation is done, just pop in the windows installation cd, and install windows on the unused partition of the hard drive.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...

I do tech support for Apple iMacs and I get these kind of questions everyday.<br>  <br>  The Quicktime on your friends mac can only support formats like *.MP4, *.MOV and MPEG1<br>  <br>  You can still play that video if you have additional codecs installed in your friends Mac, I always suggest downloading and installing the codec from this website <br>  www.perian.org<br>  <br>  The codec from the site supports a plentyful amount of video formats like<br>  File formats: AVI, DIVX, FLV, MKV, GVI, VP6, and VFW <br>  Video types: MS-MPEG4 v1 & v2, DivX, 3ivx, H.264, Sorenson H.263, FLV/Sorenson Spark, FSV1, VP6, H263i, VP3, HuffYUV, FFVHuff, MPEG1 & MPEG2 Video, Fraps, Snow, NuppelVideo, Techsmith Screen Capture, DosBox Capture <br>  Audio types: Windows Media Audio v1 & v2, Flash ADPCM, Xiph Vorbis (in Matroska), and MPEG Layer I & II Audio, True Audio, DTS Coherent Acoustics, Nellymoser ASAO <br>  AVI support for: AAC, AC3 Audio, H.264, MPEG4, and VBR MP3 <br>  Subtitle support for SSA/*** and SRT<br>  <br>  <br>  That website never fails to satisfy my customers so go ahead and tell your friend to download and install it. =P|`|RyvKws7Laa	No, but depending on what you edited and exported it with, your friend might not have the same codec list as you.  So it could be that your friend needs to install the same software as you in order to have the same codec list that you're using.  If you edited it in Final Cut Pro I would definitely expect this to be the case.  iMovie this shouldn't happen though.|`|BJwmWP2Taa	You can use this software to converter Video formats for your friedn's Mac OS.<br>  <a href="http://www.sharewareguide.net/Audio-Multimedia/Video-Tools/xilisoft-video-converter.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sharewareguide.net/Audio-Mult...</a>

But i suggest you to format your computer hard drive completely using Seagate Disc Drive (if you are using seagate).<br>  <br>  Install your OS firstly and install your drivers for hardware (try it from your mother board cd) and install Anti virus and get update up to date.<br>  Then you problem will be solved.<br>  <br>  If you are using Pierate OS and antivirus please get it orginally from the reseller or direct company.  I also faced the same problem previously, as my suggesstion from my engineer i bought original OS and antivirus.  Since 2008 march i am not facing any issues.|`|isbLqfgdaa	Check your services under Admin tools-->services and set unneeded ones to"disable" or  "manual".

wUqeZl3Saa	Start with your constants.<br>  <br>  You need a main loop to handle the time limit. I suggest using minutes as the base simulated time since that is the base for the cars. On second thought, you may need to use seconds as the time base and convert accordingly. The light times will be in seconds and govern everything. Either way will probably work since the car time will rarely sync with the light time unless an effort is made to force them to sync.<br>  <br>  You'll probably need a few counters to keep track of cars and how many go through at each time unit.<br>  <br>  A small street would be a single lane of traffic. The large street perhaps a double lane of traffic. So the double lane can handle twice the traffic if the lights are timed equal.<br>  <br>  One thing that is missing is the amount of time it takes to get one car through the light so you can figure out how many cars get through.<br>  <br>  You might want to sit and watch a real traffic light at a busy intersection during a peak time when all the cars don't make it through the light all the time.<br>  <br>  Next sort out the times for the lights. I don't see a yellow light here so there is no warning. Maybe the cars all have instant brakes. I'd like to see that technology. Maybe warp fields to keep people from being mush on their own windshields?<br>  <br>  I wonder if a demand light is allowed? The light counts cars and trips for cars arriving on the small street for a fixed time and leave the large street run.<br>  <br>  The problem is not well defined. So I tossed out some ideas and a bit of reasoning behind them. In the real world there are standards for traffic lights that would make this simulation easier to write.<br>  <br>  Shadow Wolf|`|AA10718780	hey man im doing this same project right now its so hard did u finsih it can u email me the souce code? <br>  <br>  thatguycc@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  thanks!
beQolBQJaa	Spencer, if you did not change anything when or after you installed iTunes in your computer then your songs are already in the "My Documents" folder. The default location should be C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My documents\My music\iTunes\iTunes Music<br>  If you want to make sure just open iTunes, right click any song and select "Show in Windows explorer", it will take you to the exact location of that song. If you want to move them to another location just right click the FILE and copy and paste it to the new folder, if you delete the original file the next time you want to play it with iTunes it won't be able to find it because it won't be inside of the default folder (the one I gave you above).<br>  Hope it is what you wanted to know!

jExG16NGaa	Oi. As duas causas mais comuns de pc reiniciando s?o  superakecimento do processador, e virus. em segundo lugar, corrompimento do sistema operacional, o ke é mais incomum. Se ao ligar o pc, ele fica funcionando normal uns 5 minutos e de repente desliga do nada, com certeza o seu processador está superakecendo. A maioria das placas m?e tem um gatilho ke desliga o pc no ato qdo a temperatura do processador xega a um patamar "X", para evitar ke ele keime. Nesse caso, ou o cooler do seu processador está todo imundo de poeira e sujeira, ou ele é inadequado ao processador ke vc tem. Nesse caso vc teria ke abrir o pc e verificar essas duas coisas,  se for poeira, tirar e lavar o dissipador de calor de aluminio (desparafusando a ventoinha, logicamente), secá-lo bem e remontá-lo no processador. Se o cooler for inadequado, trocá-lopor um mais poderoso., Mas vc n?o souber fazer, leve o pc a um técnico de confian?a.<br>  <br>  No caso de o pc reiniciar de forma aleatória, sem um padr?o , tipo, podendo ficar horas funcionando depois de ligado e tb podendo reiniciar depois de 1 minuto ligado, é mais provável ke seja virus. O ideal seria instalar um bom antivirus, atualizá-lo,  e fazer uma varredura. Recomendo Kaspersky Antivirus, é feroz. Com isso o problema deve se resolver, sendo virus. Se o pc n?o fica sem reiniciar tempo suficiente pra baixar e instalar o antivirus, o superakecimento é a causa mais provável, embora tb possa ser virus. Nesse caso, só formatando mesmo.Abra?o.|`|AA12005596	Provavelmente é virus.|`|a94cf32cbccc9ec332bcc25492b34847aa	Na minha opini?o , hardware....<br>  pode ser a fonte, memória, ou placa m?e...<br>  Une accolade|`|0b88cab5affb2ffe6606e9fd4b8fca45aa	Decerto é virus!!,tem os que costumam fazer isso mesmo,estabilizador n?o faz isso ate onde sei,programas certamente que n?o,e placas de Hardware é muito improvavel.|`|5156bc1fe329856a249ed0ecd629bf18aa	a 1a op?ao é virus: se vc formatar o PC  ou retirar o HD do seu PC e passar Anti - Virus e o problema continuar, é problema no HD, o negocio é comprar outro...|`|UUbyuJloaa	Provavelmente hardware esquentando muito, geralmente se está usando algo pesado no pc.<br>  <br>  Se vc n?o entende de nada só levando no técnico.|`|b0dd78e9b58971bd48c0906cff02bb7baa	Tem vírus que causam isso.

Sin embargo son tres los más usados ahora en el mundo: Linux, Windows y Mac OS X. <br>  <br>  Casi todo mundo usa Windows en "el escritorio", pero hay muchas empresas donde Linux es el sistema operativo predominante en los centros de cómputo mientras que OS X es más usado para aplicaciones gráficas. <br>  <br>  La verdad es que Windows es el peor de los tres, sin embargo Microsoft estuvo en el lugar y momento adecuado cuando la IBM necesitaba un sistema operativo para su nueva PC. <br>  <br>  Hoy en día, los sistemas operativos de MS son los más usados no porque sean los mejores, sino porque desgraciadamente la gente tiene flojera de ver otras cosas y prefieren "malo por conocido que bueno por conocer".|`|f279d86878de01a58c4fdba6623127a1aa	Mac Os, linux, Unix, ambientes operativos: Lindows, <br>  <br>  Porque es un monopolio sobre las PCs y todo está en compatibilidad con ellos|`|adef3e0886f5c309406aa64945d08cafaa	Existen muchos sistemas operativos tantos que seria dificil definirlos a todos, esta variedad se debe a la gran cantidad de arquitecturas con las que contamos actualmente.

SRUG2lXMaa	Nunca tinha ouvido falar dessa hipótese, mais fiquei curiosa e fui conferir, achei horrível e de péssimo gosto,.Algumas propagandas s?o explicitamente abusivas e passam mensagens que v?o contra moral da maioria das pessoas, como em duas propagandas (numa delas aparece uma mulher usando roupa íntima sendo agredida por dois marmanjos e a frase "_Legalizem logo o Aborto! N?o quero ficar esperando!" estampada em destaque; e na outra uma mulher de suti? e calcinha ignora um homem obeso nu ajoelhado implorando por aten??o e em destaque a frase "Detesto comida a quilo". Ao ver tais propagandas as mulheres s?o incentivadas a agir de forma abusiva para encarnarem as modelos da prestigiada marca feminina DuLoren; pois como a moda diz: grifes vendem mais a marca do que a própria roupa.

A very long time ago, relative to computers, 128k (kilobytes - 128,000 bytes) was fair memory at about $1 per kilobyte. Today 512k is a minimum to function and is a lot less money, 1Meg (megabyte, 1,000,000) is more of a standard with 2Megs being better for gaming and intensive application use. Today you can get a computer that will allow for gigabytes of memory (1,000,000,000). We also now hear words like terabyte and petabyte, most often associated with hard storage.<br>  <br>  RAM is Random Access Memory. RAM is all electronic and all of its data goes away when you turn off the computer. This is why you should save all data and close all programs before shutting down. <br>  <br>  RAM is what your computer may use to "load" programs and either have them running in the background (like an antivirus) or to process program information you are using, like WORD or EXCEL. We used to even create a RAM drive in startup. If you want to see all of the stuff your computer is doing inside the RAM, pres CTRL_ALT_DELETE all at one time (and only once), then click the tab called processes, you will be amazed. The tab for applications is what you have opened yourself.<br>  <br>  RAM lets you do things a LOT faster than if you had to let the computer read and write everything from a mechanical hard drive. Hard drives work in milliseconds, RAM in nanoseconds.<br>  <br>  Your computer will use all of the memory it can, then start writing things to the hard drive as it needs more memory. So, the more memory you have the less it has to write to the hard drive while you work and your programs will go faster, especially if you do pictures.|`|AA12332900	Click on My Comptuer then Properties.

Data only remains here while your computer is switched on. As soon as you switch of your computer, any data will be lost. To make it a little simpler, if you do not save a document you have been typing before you turn off your computer, it will be lost. The document is being held in the RAM only untiol you save it. Your computer can then be switched off without permanently losing your document.<br>  <br>  The more RAM your computer has installed, the better. To find out how much you have installed, do the following:<br>  <br>  1. Click your start button<br>  <br>  2. Click control panel.<br>  <br>  This next part will depend on whether your control panel is set to classic or catagory view. If your control panel is set to category view, click on performance and maintenance, then click on system. If your control panel is in classic view, ignore the performance and maintenance part and double click on system. The amount of RAM installed will be displayed on this page amongst other information. You should find a number followed by MB, for example 256 MB. This number represents how much RAM you have. For a Windows XP computer, 256 MB will work, however 512 MB is better.

fgbZugDlaa	WiFi is a wireless connection that connects to a wired internet connection via the main source.  You connect to a WiFi router or access point which is connected to the internet at a main source.  <br>  <br>  So it goes (End User Wireless Computer/Laptop) connects wireless to (Wireless Access Point/Wireless Router) which is then hardwired to the Cable or DSL Modem Connection, or other type of main internet connection. <br>  <br>  A WiFi connection isn't free unless somebody has free WiFi set up for you to connect to.  My home has a wireless network, for example, that is setup through a router.  If I want, my neighbor can use my WiFi connection, but I have to let them do this by providing them a WEP key.<br>  <br>  WiFi doesn't have any weird connections from your computer, it is wireless (hence the Wi).|`|hxXaB5kFaa	wirless fidellity, it's an internet connection.<br>  the signals go through the telephone and into a router....a website should serve you better than Y!A<br>  <br>  wrielessly or through a wire you can recieve internet using a router.|`|9lyzXd1Yaa	ITS THE FINAL COUNTDOWN!!!!

Then once inside, there should always be a "Restore to optimal settings" or reset to optimal/failsafe. Those should reset all possible overclocks and you can use your computer at stock.<br>  <br>  Remember.. don't overclock again unless you know what you're doing..<br>  <br>  A setting too high can literally start a fire.

fgbZugDlaa	Edit-Thumbs down?  Uhm, my answer is correct in every way.  You either have a socketed CPU, or it is soldered to the motherboard.  If it is socketed it can be replaced with a similar mobile CPU, but the selection is usually very limited and dependent on support from the laptop manufacturer beyond just socket support, support for the particular CPU must be in the BIOS.-Edit|`|zxyevbRgaa	It matters they have to be mobile processors.<br>  first thing to do is look up the specs on your pc<br>  find out what processors your chipset supports <br>  <br>  try ebay<br>  <a href="http://shop.ebay.com/items/__laptop-processor_W0QQ_kwZlaptopQQ_kwZprocessorQQ_armZ1QQ_armiZlaptopQ20processorQ20upgradeQQ_armmZ104QQ_ckwZupgradeQQ_fromfsbZQQ_ruuZhttpQ3aQ2fQ2fshopQ2eebayQ2ecomQ2fitemsQ2fQ5fQ5flaptopQ2dprocessorQ2dupgradeQ5fW0Q51Q51Q5farrQ5A1Q51Q51Q5ffromfsbQ5AQ51Q51Q5ftrksidQ5Am270Q512el1313QQ_trksidZm270Q2el1313" rel="nofollow">http://shop.ebay.com/items/__laptop-proc...</a>|`|B7THwJxvaa	As long as it matches the CPU socket, it will work.

fgbZugDlaa	I think this is where a torrent can serve as a legal medium.  If you have a legit key, you can use a .torrent to download Windows XP and use your key.  There is nothing wrong with this, as you are using your own license.<br>  <br>  If you need help with finding a torrent and downloading, e-mail me, I don't went to help on the publicly available forum, as somebody could use torrents for illegal purposes, which I don't condone.  Take care!|`|7PS3fSSPaa	Yes you can. or you can find someone who has the disk and boot from their disk. I wouldn't spend money on xp its getting old dude.|`|g6easyBFaa	You cannot "buy" WinXP Pro Tablet Edition.  It is strictly OEM.  And regular XP installs do not have the TabletPC components you want.<br>  <br>  Luckily most TabletPC manufacturers will allow you to buy the appropriate Restore Disks.  Just call them with your model# and serial# and you may get the disks for a nominal fee.  I got a set of disks for an old HP TC1000 some years back for about $10 direct from HP.

If he tried to tamper with said network, that is another story.  However, you are providing access to porn and other internet access over said network.  Thus...you are potentially breaking more laws than him.  Sigh...sad but true.<br>  <br>  You might want to think about how you may be throwing some personal responsibility out of the window just for the sake of busting a kid.<br>  <br>  If he stole a PS3 and connects to your network with it, how would you know?

SZ9TJvVaaa	This is coming from a very experienced person. THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO ME. Here is how you fix it. First. Do you have a wireless router? If so find the brand and go to this website: <a href="http://www.routerpasswords.com/." rel="nofollow">http://www.routerpasswords.com/.</a> Find your router on the site and write down it's user name and password. Then, click start/Accessories/command prompt. A black window will appear. Type: ipconfig. Find your "DEFAULT GATEWAY." Open an internet explorer page and type your default gateway. Normally a page with your router brand will appear. Type in your user name and password. Minimize that window. Open control panel. Find system OR click Remote access. and find the computer name tab. Open it. Find "Full Computer name" Remember it. Open back up your internet explorer window. Click settings and find Enable MAC address. Find your computer name from the list an click save your router will restart. You now have encryption and no one can steal your wireless any longer.<br>  <br>  PS. You can also set up a WEP key, but I don't recommend it because it willl slow your connection.|`|fbcc08ab14324fa71f4ec63edcac9921aa	Most manufacturers provide instructions on how this is done with there specific router. If the original manual is lost, information can usually be downloaded from the manufactures web site. This article assumes that the router is installed and providing internet to you. The first step in setting up your wireless security is to access your routers settings page. This can be done from your computers browser. Note that often times it is best to not be connected through your wireless connection but rather through a direst cable connection with your router. To do this simply take a cat5 cable (usually supplied with your router) and connect it directly from your computer to an open port on your router. You can see from the image that there are several ports labeled with yellow and one labeled with blue. The blue denotes the port where the internet feed (from your cable modem or DSL modem) plugs in. The yellow ports indicate where directly connected computers are to be connected. There may be now color or labels on your router but generally it is set up the same. Hook your computer to the yellow ports.<br>  Step2<br>  Be sure that your computer is connected and has internet. The next step is to enter your routers set-up page. You can get to your routers set up page through your internet browser by entering its address in the address bar. So what my router address? Your routers address depends on the manufacture. But typically with be like this 192.168.1.1 . Depending on your manufacturer the last two digits will change. This is where your manual will be helpful. If you do not have your manual, Google the brand and model of your router and you should find the address with your manufactures info. You may also find the address by going into your network connection in windows. Simply right click your internet connection in your network connection window and click status. Then click the support tab. The address for your router will be the numbers after default gateway.<br>  Step3<br>  After typing in your routers address in the address bar you may be asked to login. After typing in your routers address in the address bar you may be asked to login. When you have entered your routers address in the address bar hit enter. Your browser will either take you to the main setup page for your router or ask you for a login and password. If you are asked for a login and password again refer to your manufacturers manual or web site. Generally its some combination of "admin" for login and password or "admin" for login and no password. Sometimes even "password" for the password.<br>  Step4<br>  Your routers setup screen should look somewhat like this. Your routers setup screen should look somewhat like this. Now your at your routers setup screen it should look somewhat like this.<br>  Step5<br>  Find your wireless security settings. Find your wireless security settings. Now find your wireless security tab. Every router is different, it may take some clicking around to find it.<br>  Step6<br>  WPA and WPA2 is standard on most home networks. WPA and WPA2 is standard on most home networks. Once you found your wireless security settings you will notice that they are disabled. You should have several options when it comes to the type of security that you can choose. I prefer WPA, it allows you to simply enter a password to access your wireless network. This password can of course be saved in your wireless settings so there is no need to enter it but one time.<br>  Step7<br>  Simply enter your password in the password box and hit save. Your wireless network is now secure. Distribute the password to anyone that is allowed access to your wireless network.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Ask your ISP how to set a password|`|Jf9aKluvaa	You didnt say what router you are using for your wireless connection.

8BLFVkahaa	it really depends if you can overclock at all. if your motherboard, or i should say whole computer came from dell, hp, or anything like that then most likely you will not be able to, because they install their own bios which makes it impossible unless you can flash it to the boards manufacturer. now that we are past that,. if you selected the components yourself, then you shoud be able to overclock that particular proc very easily. most older procs take alot of tweaking and a ton of settings have to be changed, but since that is a newer intel it wont be hard at all. there should be a bunch of online guides that will help you. look them up. youll want to find the basic overclocking ones, not the extreme overclock since your running air. i do know that the wolfdale cpus can be overclocked to 3.8 from 3.0 with just a simple change of the fsb. maybe a voltage change too i cant remember. but that is all you had to do, which makes it very simple. make sure to run cpu stress tests and keep your temperatures in good range, test those under heavy load like video conversion. i dont know what you plan to do with your cpu, but it looks like if your were gaming overclocking your cpu would be the next best thing to do after a new video card.

Even at work, thought leaders speeding down the raceways of corporate productivity tend to view information security, with its countermeasure technologies, additional staff requirements, and procedural controls, as costly and frustrating speed bumps. And the same controls frustrate their employees, just as serious about getting their work done.<br>  <br>  That's the traditional view. Chief technology officers who step into more enlightened settings find, with the right counsel, that information security is not the Budget Bad Guy. Good security planning does not always bring greater TCO. It can actually improve your bottom line. The reason is that both low TCO and security require good organization and the elimination or automation of repetitive, mindless tasks. Good security planning and TCO are hardly strange bedfellows. In forward-thinking organizations, they go hand in hand.<br>  <br>  How much do those thousands of PCs and hundreds of servers really cost you? The initial purchase price of hardware and software has been shown to be a fraction. My old manager, coming from Montana, called it the care-and-feeding costs long before TCO became the analysts' mantra. A steer brought to maturity costs more than what you paid for it as a calf. You have to consider how much feed and time went into the animal, as well. The situation is the same with PCs and client-server applications. They yield productivity gains in fits and starts, but the question remains: For each hour gained, how many are spent by users and support personnel fixing problems and trying to make these Rube Goldberg fantasies work? That is TCO.<br>  <br>  As for security in enterprise environments, technology officers discover soon enough that without automation, TCO skyrockets and security needs languish. CTOs definitely do not need this problem. With careers under smoking guns from accounting, CTOs had better make the right moves to create an ongoing security infrastructure. Translation: That infrastructure must be cost-effective.<br>  <br>  The CTO might as well throw in the towel if his well-paid administrators are manually installing and setting up new workstations and servers, deploying hotfixes and patches to existing systems, installing applications, performing repetitive account management chores, event log archiving, and checking on batch jobs, backups, and security policy assessments.<br>  <br>  If they are busy with manual handling of these mundane tasks, they are not as responsive in handling user-support issues. New projects and opportunities simmer on the back burner. Security needs such as keeping up-to-date with new exploits and patches, monitoring, and policy compliance often go totally neglected until that fateful day when it is too late.<br>  <br>  Many third-party products in the security market can handle these kinds of problems. Whereas these tools are expensive, none of them handles every category or every situation in the "various and sundry" environment mix found today. Even if you are fortunate to have something like Tivoli or any of the other enterprise-management frameworks, you still need the ability to automate unique processes.<br>  <br>  For IT planners working with Microsoft BackOffice servers, one might heed the wisdom of a security consultant with whom I had dinner at a recent conference. He views the Microsoft BackOffice environment as the "Full Employment Act," with Windows NT's growing feature set and API frameworks.<br>  <br>  NT has relatively new scripting tools, which rival older platforms, going largely unused. These newer scripting languages go way beyond the BAT files we grew up with on DOS. An excellent version of Perl is alive and kicking in NT's Resource Kit. Perl has long been the lingua franca for Unix administrators seeking to automate tasks and integrate services. Perl has excellent text string parsing and pipe processing, making it perfect for forming dynamic system commands and processing their output. This is the first high-level language on NT that really works for unattended background processing. Thanks to its lineage, NT's Perl lacks the interactive mindset of other languages such as Visual Basic that don't dependably run in a detached daemon process because of assumptions about the GUI environment.<br>  <br>  Visual Basic used to frustrate our team to distraction with its nasty habit of popping up dialog boxes on error conditions after we had supposedly implemented error handlers for all contingencies. Unattended background processes would mysteriously pause for eternity while Visual Basic waited for a dialog box to be dismissed by an operator who would never come. NT's Perl comes with native support for accessing some Win32 system services like the registry and support for COM object instantiation and messaging. Perl gives you the overall scripting infrastructure.<br>  <br>  Another crucial scripting tool for NT is the Windows Script Host. WSH is not a language. Its primary value is its collection of COM objects that give you a high-level interface to system functions. There are objects for managing drive mappings, environment variables, shortcuts, registry keys, and logon scripts. Since WSH is implemented as COM objects, you can use any ActiveX scripting language for your scripting.<br>  <br>  Complementing WSH is the Active Directory Services Interface. ADSI is another collection of COM objects for accessing the directory service of NT 4.0, 5.0, and even Netware. There are objects for managing user accounts, services, domains, and shares. With WSH and ADSI, you can automate many of the error-prone tasks that would take hours using native utilities such as User Manager, Registry Editor, and Control Panel.<br>  <br>  The Resource Kit itself has a cornucopia of utilities that any Unix administrator takes for granted. It is really the other half of NT. With it you can you can do some poor man's system management, such as setting up a secure framework for delivering hotfixes and other configuration tweaks to thousands of workstations at once.<br>  <br>  Granted, some of these tools have been around for a while. But it is surprising to see how little they are actually used. Typical PC administrators do not have the concept of "managed" systems. The systems often manage them. They grew up in the interactive, graphical world of PCs and are locked into the mindset of doing everything through an interactive, graphical interface. Until recently, the only recourse was to code to comparatively low-level system APIs using C++. The crucial in-between option of interpreted scripts just wasn't there.<br>  <br>  My own experience in helping a large lending company indicates a winning security scenario. This company has thousands of users and a typical heterogeneous environment, including NetWare 4, MVS, and NT—a common situation resulting in many user accounts for each person. The company was struggling to find a practical, affordable way to implement a single log-on. It needed an interim solution to reduce the risks and costs that are associated with multiple accounts per person. Why risks? Because maintaining multiple accounts is error-prone. Multiple accounts raise troublesome issues: If the person leaves the company, has each account been properly disabled? Are passwords being synchronized? When users forget their passwords, how does one efficiently re-set it on each system? To tackle all these questions means to increase labor costs. The solution was in scripting. The company's IS staff designed a modest script application that collected user accounts from each system daily into a database. Staff included the employee number in user account names. The result: All the important account records were joined to a master user account. The security-support group, from this database, was able to disable accounts and re-set password and account lockouts with one fell swoop.<br>  <br>  The database was accurate, since it was synthesized from the actual operating system directories. The daily collection script could also identify accounts not compliant with the naming standard, and thus reduce the risk of accounts not managed through this application. The company was close to making a large expenditure to implement the NT and NetWare portions using C++ and the respective operating system SDKs. They saved thousands and were able to implement much sooner, using WSH and ADSI.<br>  <br>  Nevertheless, while scripting was key to the above solution, it is no silver bullet for security planning. Scripting and automation are great for systems management, but just throwing some scripts and tools at security issues won't solve them. What needs to be addressed instead is the tension that dwells among the roles of user support, administration, and security. User-support calls will expand to fill the schedule of any group. Security needs tend to flicker as a dim warning light in the back of the administrator's mind while user needs ring out stridently from the phone. Security procedures can also create new inconveniences and new support calls, running counter to a busy administrator's desires.<br>  <br>  That's where the concept of "division of responsibility" lies. There's an interesting relationship going on in division of responsibility, security, and cost-effective planning. More and more organizations are looking at a "division of responsibility" arrangement to handle the functions of policy compliance, security administration, general administration, and user support.<br>  <br>  Internal Audit traditionally has a staff specializing in assessing systems and application control. These folks usually come from a financial background and are generalists by virtue of the number of platforms they must audit. But they endeavor to measure security-policy compliance and flush out risks using a sound audit methodology. It is a tradition that Internal Audit handles policy compliance and assessment of risk control and IT provided everything else. But that is changing. More organizations are using three distinct groups within IT to separate first-line user support, security administration, and general administration of applications and systems and networks.<br>  <br>  On paper, the concept is ideal. Designate a group of technical people and empower them to implement good security procedures and administration. Offload this work from the general administrators and eliminate the conflict of interest. Easier said than done.<br>  <br>  We had a real challenge getting the rest of the IT structure to recognize this group and educating the group itself to understand that their mission was more than just creating accounts and changing passwords. This well-intentioned initiative often slows down and the security group does not see a way out of the tough issues.<br>  <br>  What, then, are effective security groups? The groups that I've observed share four common traits:<br>  <br>  ? Each group has at least one technical person with a grounding in systems management of the more mature platforms of the past. This tends to give them a more disciplined approach to problem solving and raises their expectations about how dependable and automated solutions should be. This is a perspective missing in many administrators who have only worked on PCs.<br>   <br>  ? A good group has a consummate hacker, the kind of person who can always theorize a way around a control no matter how much it sounds like science fiction.<br>   <br>  ? The group leader, the Chief Security Officer, is someone with good business sense who can find the difficult balance between cost of countermeasure and potential cost of risk.<br>  <br>  Just as importantly, the CSO needs technical confidence because, of all IT disciplines, none is more technically esoteric than information security. But it is up to him to help management to understand intangible threats if anything is to be done. The organization will not bear expenditures and less-than-convenient procedures if they are not sold on need. The leader needs to answer to the CTO and must be empowered to get things done.<br>   <br>  ? A good security group constantly reevaluates the environment to explore how to implement cost- and risk-effective solutions. They look for ways to automate and consider third-party tools if they make good business sense. Change is a co-efficient of any security formula. New exploits are constantly being discovered. Security technologies such as cryptography, intrusion detection, and authentication are always evolving.<br>   <br>  We at Microsoft Corporation hope that the information in this work is valuable to you.

You'll have loads, and I mean loads of fun reading it. <br>  Don't go into complicated stuff at the beggining (STL, templates, classes). Learn the language, its peculiarities, do about a hundred simple programs, then start with classes. After about a year of practise, start doing an interesting project (maybe a file manager, a small (and I mean small) game (Battle Ships or anything that pushes your buttons).<br>  Learn some algorithms today! While knowing a programming language gives you a degree of power, nothing is more powerful than knowing your algorithms, because then the language you use won't really matter (well, almost).<br>  Try backtracking, greedy, divide and conquer and after you've mastered these, move to more advanced programming methods, like dynamic programming (no, I'm not talking about pointers).<br>  Learn data structures. Basics: stacks, trees (binary, red-black, and so on), vectors, matrices, heaps, lists, queues. Implement them using classes. Implement them using templates. Probably the best book for data structures and algorithms is 'Data Structures and Algorithms' by Cormen and Co. <br>  You'll need to learn some design language (UML?) eventually, but that's another story.

If that doesn't work, take it back to Circuit City.|`|4e373e6f314842f8e453aa71b98d5c4caa	It's most likely a simple matter of turning it back on.  Open the Control Panel and click on "Sounds and Audio".  Then just follow the prompts.  You may also have to reinstall the driver from the Device Manager.  If you have any problems, I'm sure some geek at Circuit City can walk you through these steps over the phone.  Another option is using the Help and Support center Windows program.  The troubleshooters in here are very useful tools.  Very "user friendly".|`|93c015937f46b2464bc62b27bc9dd2baaa	Start simple.

Try and see if there is a way to connect a regular monitor to your laptop,the port should be somewhere in the back or sides of your laptop|`|w9JfBQwKaa	Hmmmm.  If you can't see anything on the old laptop then you'll have a hard time of it.  You could maybe tear the old laptop apart, snatch the HD out of it, and then connect that HD to the new laptop, and then use Hiren's BootCD or something like that to copy the whole HD over to the new laptop.  I think that would work.  <br>  <br>  Is there an operating system istalled on the old laptop?<br>  <br>  If not, try installing an OS or booting to a CD (Hiren's BootCD, again) and see what happens from there.  It's possible your Master Boot Record or your Boot Configuration got messed up.|`|4e373e6f314842f8e453aa71b98d5c4caa	Since you already have a new laptop, yes you can and should transfer everything to it from your old one.  You don't have to settle for using the new PC as a mere monitor.  It is almost the same procedure to transfer your system as it would be to add a new monitor anyway!  (Just as easy)  All the easy reading info you need to show you how to do this is at your local bookstore for about $20.00.  You will also have to have your Windows installation CD.|`|58034a24bc6fab1545d509dfc5549adeaa	Yes you should try to hook up a monitor to it to see if you can view anything that way. Otherwise if you can't see anything your best bet would be to get an external case for the laptops hard drive and remove it from the laptop and stick it in the external case and hook that up to the new laptop to retrieve your files. You can get an external case at radio shack for like 29.00 or less maybe a little more.

a94cf32cbccc9ec332bcc25492b34847aa	Só uso firefox a dois anos..<br>  <br>  Simplicidade, rapidez, seguran?a e praticidade! Pré-requisitos para um navegador, n?o é? Pois bem, o Firefox n?o é apenas um navegador, e sim um ótimo navegador, portanto suas qualidades se sobressaem. Ele é baseado em um conjunto de novas tecnologias que procura tornar a experiência de navegar na Internet melhor e mais rápida.<br>  <br>  Características e ferramentas avan?adas:<br>  <br>  é muito veloz, abrindo páginas e imagens com um sistema desenvolvido para aprimorar e diminuir bastante o intervalo de tempo para carregar arquivos, possuindo também um sistema de navega??o em múltiplos sites usando a mesma janela — navegando por abas —, recursos de busca direta no Google, Yahoo, Amazon e qualquer outro sistema de busca que você queira adicionar!<br>  <br>  Sabe aquele monte de janelas que lhe deixa maluco e perdido? A navega??o por abas resolve esse problema! Basta apenas uma janela para dividir vários sites em abas para você navegar e compará-los à vontade, pois com apenas um clique você irá para a página ao lado. Nesta vers?o ele está ainda melhor: agora cada aba possui um pequeno "X" para ser fechada. Uma pequena melhoria que facilita a vida do usuário ao navegar em várias páginas da Web. Clicando com o bot?o direito você também encontra op??es para adicionar o site à lista de favoritos.<br>  <br>  Conta com um sistema de busca de palavras mais aprimorado (CTRL + F), destacando as palavras pesquisadas com marcadores. Tem integra??o total ao sistema de leitura de notícias RSS e o mais legal de tudo, você pode personalizar sua interface escolhendo diferentes temas!<br>  <br>  Temas e Extens?es<br>  <br>  Uma das novidades mais interessantes é o suporte às chamadas extens?es. O que é uma extens?o?<br>  <br>  Extens?es para o navegador Firefox significam plugins (add-ons) para você incrementar pequenas ferramentas no navegador ao seu gosto, ou seja, adicionar diferentes miniaplicativos para o navegador, tais como: fazer download de vídeos de portais streaming, escutar músicas pelo navegador, FTPs, visualizar valores de cores, editar imagens, e muito outros.<br>  <br>  Um dos grandes diferenciais do Firefox em rela??o aos concorrentes é a possibilidade de personaliza??o, sendo possível obter o visual do Firefox mais parecido com você!<br>  <br>  Seguran?a<br>  <br>  Seguran?a é um assunto sério e deve estar em primeiro lugar quando estamos acessando a Internet. Comprar produtos pela web e realizar movimenta??o monetária está se tornando mais comum no Brasil. Até mesmo navegar é algo que necessita de prote??o, pois sites contendo aplica??es maliciosas é o que n?o faltam.<br>  <br>  O Firefox é considerado um dos navegadores existentes mais seguros, sen?o o mais seguro. Ele possui um sistema que bloqueia janelas pop-ups que abrem sem o seu consentimento, bloqueia aplica??es e aplicativos que tentam iniciar ao entrar em websites suspeitos e também um sistema anti-phishing para protegê-lo de páginas fraudulentas, como clones de sites de bancos, por exemplo.<br>  Une accolade|`|AA12005596	Internet Explorer é o melhor, mas eu gosto de Firefox também.|`|1466ee4a77fa2de616ab4e0e39a6325aaa	O melhor da atualidade é o Mozilla Firefox, que já é o mais usado na Europa segundo vi na internet.

ff322101f6e3ee6af2376289292eac22aa	Número da Besta, Marca de Besta, 666, meia-meia-meia, seiscentos e sessenta e seis ou ainda seis-seis-seis,número da casa do Aru, é de acordo com a tradi??o crist?, um número correspondente ao nome da Besta, e que equivale ao 666 (616 em alguns manuscritos). De acordo com o Apocalipse, este número será grafado na testa ou na m?o dos que viverem sob o domínio da Besta (Apocalipse 13:16–18)<br>  A origem da profecia provavelmente está associada à tessera, sinal marcado sobre os escravos romanos. Deste modo, o autor de Apocalipse estaria associando o uso da marca da Besta a uma forma de escraviza??o desta Besta.<br>  No sistema de numera??o romano, os números s?o compostos por múltiplos de 1 e 5, que perfazem 6, nas unidades, dezenas e centenas. Assim, a marca do império romano provém da simples utiliza??o dos números I, V, X, L, C e D; respectivamente 1 + 5 + 10 + 50 + 100 + 500 (666), dando origem a uma série de supersti??es.|`|6mzMvR52aa	nao sei|`|9e8fc38d5b3b5ed0c100eb6f603efb85aa	1 - Papa Bento XVI<br>  2 - Reverendo Moon<br>  3 - R.

CHLl09PJaa	Olá,<br>  <br>  é bem simples, coloca ele na quarentena, deixa o vírus la por 1 semana... se o seu computador estiver funcionando normalmente numa boa é só excluir.<br>  <br>  Grande abra?o.<br>  <br>  -=| Fe |=-|`|AA12005596	Eu coloco em quarentena, depois deleto.|`|041e6252efb55962f9628b5aef9cc230aa	à medida em que ele for achando os vírus vá colocando eles na quarentena, e depois de alguns dias se tudo estiver bem com o seu computador pode excluir definitivamente esses vírus da quarentena. Ou se vc achar desnecessário colocar os vírus na quarentena, vc pode excluir esses vírus definitivamente do seu computador. Eu costumo já excluir o vírus definitivamente.<br>  <br>  Fa?a a atualiza??o freqüente deste antivírus e fa?a uma verifica??o completa semanalmente para retirar os vírus que já estiverem no computador e para impedir de novos vírus infectarem o seu PC. <br>  <br>  Talvez seja necessário vc reiniciar o seu computador e entrar pelo modo de seguran?a (apertando a tecla F8 (ou a tecla F5 em alguns computadores) repetidas vezes quando o computador estiver reiniciando e escolhendo a op??o Modo Seguro ou Modo de Seguran?a. Aí quando o computador tiver reiniciado, vc escaneia o computador com seu antivírus e seu antispyware e vá retirando os vírus e programas espi?es do seu computador). <br>  <br>  Também uma ótima op??o é agendar um escaneamento no boot. Para isso, fa?a o seguinte:  clique com o bot?o direito do mouse sobre o símbolo do Avast (aquele ′′a`` azul que fica rodando ao lado do relógio do Windows e escolha a op??o: Iniciar o Antivírus Avast! - Quando a tela principal do Avast aparecer, clique com o bot?o esquerdo do mouse sobre aquela setinha virada para cima que fica no canto superior esquerdo da tela do Avast e escolha a op??o: Agendar escaneamento no boot... - Selecione ent?o as op??es: Escanear todos os discos locais, Escanear o conteúdo dos arquivos, Op??es avan?adas - Solicitar a??o. - E aí clique em Agendar. E confirme a reinicializa??o do computador, ent?o o Avast fará um escaneamento completo do seu computador e a medida em que ele for achando os vírus vá colocando eles na quarentena, e depois de alguns dias se tudo estiver bem com o seu computador pode excluir definitivamente esses vírus da quarentena.|`|86c963ea9f578eb933ea079cb81f7320aa	Se o antivirus Avast detectar um virus , ele denuncia , e voce tem que vacinar seu PC, ele pergunta o que voce quer deletar, por na quarentena, ou deixar na memória, e ai voce aplica a vacina,no caso de n?o estar o antivirus, telefone para a revenda da vacina e diz precisar aumentar a lista de virus, que é possivel que a vacina n?o conhe?a o virus do teu PC, aparecem uma variedade enorme de virus net, na internet, fabricadas diariamente pelos Hackers.|`|8e123f93d95cff5b8980ee66e1beeaa5aa	Se o anti-vírus informou que tem esse vírus, com certeza ele já era...<br>  <br>  O anti-vírus manda p/ quarentena que é p/ enviar a base de dados da empresa, e depois de 40 dias ele deleta automaticamente sem oferecer nenhum risco ao PC.|`|OzbPuiFAaa	Ponha na quarentena,baixe o Winpooch Watchdog 0.6.6 ele localiza,combate e remove Cavalos de Tróia,Spywares,Malwares e outras pragas virtuais é grátis e em portugues vc acha no baixaki,abra?os álien a fera|`|6ff06f91aeb00639928e1503f98337d8aa	poim na quarentena que é melhor|`|VIpdXsgyaa	so colocar na quarentena|`|zgSI7I9waa	Colok em quarentena e deleta, mas se ? tirar o vírus vc pode ir no baixaki e baixar outro ant-virus e se nao resoulver tbm é melhor formatar o pc

Aí eles vendem o seu e-mail para empresas que fazem esses tipo de propagandas enganosas e massivas, ou seja, Spams. Para evitar que esses sites enganosos peguem novamente o seu e-mail é só vc fazer o seguinte: Primeiramente marque esses e-mails que vc recebeu como Spam, para que vc n?o receba mais e-mails deste remetente. E de agora em diante, toda vez que vc for se cadastrar em qualquer site que pe?a o seu e-mail, obtenha um e-mail temporário que só dura 10 minutos e que é o suficiente para vc se cadastrar nesses sites, vc pode obter esse e-mail temporário no link abaixo:<br>  <a href="http://www.10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.10minutemail.com/10MinuteMail...</a> <br>  Se o e-mail de confirma??o de cadastro em algum site n?o chegar em 10 minutos, é só vc pedir mais tempo no próprio site acima, aí ele te dá mais 10 minutos e assim por diante, até que o e-mail de confirma??o chegue.|`|w3bHhPaXaa	Quanto eles disseram que você ganhou?<br>  P/mim disseram por E-mail que eu tinha ganho 1.310.000, e eu fiquei boquiaberto ai eu fui no link indicado e só o que eles me pediam era o no do meu cart?o de credito e o c v v do cart?o simples assim.
