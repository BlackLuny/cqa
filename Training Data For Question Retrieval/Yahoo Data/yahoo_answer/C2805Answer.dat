HPlpIy9maa	The meat is the lowest possible allowed for human consumption.<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  <br>  I'm sorry. I double checked my facts and it turns out that there is no such thing as D-Grade beef. They USDA does not use a letter system for meat. They grade meat with terms such as, Prime, Choice, and Select. It is true, however that it is the lowest possible quality that can be sold at restaurants.<br>  <br>  Standard/Commercial grades are frequently sold as ungraded or as "store brand" meat. It is crap compared to "prime grade" or "choice grade". Taco bell makes tacos with extremely low quality meat. That's why you can buy tacos there for $0.69.|`|VDpmh2VJaa	this was yrs ago..(more than twenty)but i worked at restaurant in Parkersburg,wv<br>  we ran out of burger so we had to call around and the restraunts just traded things if they ran out and we called to borrow some meat and they didnt have it like meat it was dried?you had to add water to it for it to puff up?<br>  <br>  <br>  they may have changed it by now...<br>  <br>  i dont know i dont eat it because it makes me sick everytime...stomach cramps etc.|`|e3801fbb401743baa0ab90373a0be8ebaa	i have a coworker<br>  and she's quite wise<br>  she's even lived through MLK's time of death<br>  yes she was 13 during those segregation periods<br>  <br>  but we went to mickey d's<br>  and she told me how KFC injects their chickens to the point where they become immobile<br>  and their beaks are broken<br>  and their legs stop working<br>  so they sit and become fat<br>  <br>  then she told me how Taco Bell uses the lowest grade meat<br>  seriously, think about it<br>  if meat was really good<br>  wouldn't it be pricey? wouldn't it at least cost you 4 bucks or more just for a good sandwich or roll?<br>  think about the wet juicy meat<br>  they add stuff<br>  so think bout hw it lukz when it comes packaged to be made into food.<br>  disgusting<br>  <br>  i ate taco bell for the first time last last month<br>  and i tried their tacos<br>  it was...blegh....<br>  then my coworker told me about em<br>  i will never visit them again|`|sYRPEjsQaa	my friend who use to work there said that the meat comes in a big clear bag and it's white with dark lines all over the meat brick and they plop it into a pan and heat it up.The other person is correct Dogs will not even eat that shite.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	...i heard it's dinosaur meat|`|WrUTuQdlaa	Full of fat.

I mean graduating from Le Cordon Blu cooking school and the only job you land is Chef at kfc? heh.
