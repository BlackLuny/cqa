Hi, I am having trouble understanding some steps involved in solving this integral.      -2   ∫ (dx) / ( √(x^(2) - 1 )    -3      to solve it i have been told to let x = sec(y), why is that?      find dx/dy = sec(y) . tan(y)   dx = sec(y) . tan(y) . dy      I understand that bit.      now, this i dont understand:      -2   ∫ sec(y) . tan(y) . dy / √(tan^(2) . y)   -3      why has tan^(2) . y been substituted in to where √x^(2) - 1 was?      then when you have found the integral which is:      -2   [ ln | sec(y) + tan(y) | ]   -3      what is substituted in for what and why?      could you please show all the working      thankyou so much for this, greatly appreciate it.

Then how about the other human-like civilizations that are not really genetically related to us? I mean the once which wouldn't have evolved into Homo Sapiens Sapiens but something else?      There was the theory about the survival of the fittest, well are we the fittest among them?      Or are we just mentally more intelligent and out smarted them in past conflicts? Cus humanoids such as the Neanderthals are said to have survived in extreme cold conditions, I know, but also had a bigger face (Eyebrows, noes, mouth) that represent apes a little more (Perhaps cus they ain't fully evolved yet). But then scientists claims that they had storky bodies that are naturally allot more muscular than us, is that true?

20090306225446AABZ1xv	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Please help with physics!!!!?	A person bending forward to lift a load "with his back" rather than "with his knees" can be injured by large forces exerted on the muscles and vertebrae. The spine pivots mainly at the fifth lumbar vertebra, with the principal supporting force provided by the erector spinalis muscle in the back. For a person bending forward to lift a 200-N object, the spine and upper body are represented as a uniform horizontal rod of weight 350 N, pivoted at the base of the spine. The erector spinalis muscle, attached at a point two thirds of the way up the spine, maintains the position of the back. The angle between the spine and this muscle is 12degrees. Find the tension in the back muscle and the compressional force in the spine.      Please show steps!   The answer is T=2.71 kN, Rx=2.65kN.

The ancient Egyptians relied on a knowledge of the physics of energy transformations to build the Great Pyramids at Giza. They used ramps to push limestone blocks with an average mass of 2300 kg to heights of almost 150 m. The ramps were sloped at about 10° to the horizontal. Friction was reduced by pumping water onto the ramps.      (A) How much work would have to be done to lift an average limestone block vertically through a height of 150 m?

20090307122130AA7Y7d6	Science & Mathematics;Botany	Marijuana legilization?	Ok, So I have heard enough crap about marijuana and I really do not know who to believe anymore? I hear that you don't really get addicted to it, and I have heard that its the most addicting thing on the planet. To tell you the truth I have never heard anyone who depends on marijuana, most drug problems are because of cocaine, meth, etc. I have only had one hit of marijuana and I can't say it was something bad because really all it did was relax me a bit. I didn't get high or anything but I honestly did not get hooked. So what do you guys think? Government conspiracy? or is marijuana really something that should not be legalized?

20090307135228AAxerYv	Science & Mathematics;Agriculture	How can I get rid of ants in my yard?	How can I get rid of ants in my yard?       We have tons of ants, a neighborhood that has been growing fruit trees for 40++ years. We are over run with them. I can't go in the yard in the summer, I am allergic to them when they bite. I want to get rid of them this summer. I have been told of a few home remedies, which I want to try because I don't want to harm the animals. Cornmeal, 10xx sugar and? Boric acid? I can't remember what they were and how to use them, and what goes with what. I also want to know if Diatamaiseous Earth (aka DE) works on ants as well as the big disgusting bugs. I got a big bag of the finely ground stuff and want to dust the yard with it, if it will work.. What other minerals might work? I want to try everything possible so I might have a chance of getting rid of them. I know the DE works on the bigger bugs but not sure about the ants. Also does it work for scorpions?

I suck at geology and am struggling with this question. It's an online class so asking other students takes forever assuming they are even going to check their email. Anyway here is the question.      "Modern subdivision of Archean time and dating of Archean rocks are based on radiogenic dates. Examine Table 3-3 and indicate the isotope that is most useful in dating Archean rocks? Which is the least? "         Here are the possible answers from Table 3-3 in the book.      Carbon-14   Uranium-238   Uranium-235   Uranium-234   Thorium-232   Rubidium-87   Potassium-40

20090307144415AAe4pw7	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	Why are hydroelectric dams so rare?	Very little US electricity comes from hydroelectricity. WHY??? There are plenty of rivers across the US! How is it not practical to have miles of dams to produce electricity? (ok, I guess "miles" is an exaggeration)    But see the attached article: Ford spent $1 million to build a dam, and every year, they save $4 million by NOT purchasing electricity. As a matter of fact, they can re-sell the extra electricity they don't use.   In the case of this article:  "HOW IS IT NOT PRACTICAL TO USE THE EXISTING DAM SITE TO ADD ADDITIONAL TURBINES?"  (it wouldn't disrupt additional aqua-life any more than it already has)  add another row of turbines, generate an additional 18 mega-watts of electricity.   Thanks for any insight that you can add!!!       http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/fe...
