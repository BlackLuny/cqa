rh12tX8Naa	Every girl is different. When a guy has a fast come back, it could be hilarious. It depends...something that is funny to one girl may not be funny to another.|`|1EyRZm4Faa	Push someone down.  or  Your bro is a robot, your siter is gay, your parents are hippies...NOW GO MAKE HER LAFF|`|COmp4sIuaa	I'm just funny. I tell jokes, girls laugh. I can't control it, mate. You're either funny or you're not.    The girl above me is right, though. Random is good. I once had this girl say to me, "Kashtin, you're weird, and I don't talk to weird people, but you're Kashtin, so I talk to you."    I don't know what that means, but it must be a good thing.|`|Loyk6Cmbaa	Just think of really, really random things, but just don't say perverted things.|`|CBYFTjXHaa	umm...say something funnyy...        durr.|`|R5mmX9Woaa	I think its a personality thing, more than just making jokes. But the comedy central joke of the day are usually pretty funny. I think comedy is something your born with though.     My boyfriend is funny and that is one of the things i like about him.    Hope this Helps!    P.S: If anyone wants to help me please answer my last question.|`|9DV26vk0aa	punch her in the face thatll definaly make someone laugh|`|4hJgn2e5aa	you have to know what she thinks is funny. like some girls dont think family guy is funny or you have to find out what she thinks is funny.|`|XM4MnwqLaa	b yourself if she likes u good if not o well
luzxbhuHaa	Beat her.
5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	well, depends on what you're looking for; you could:    join a book club @ Barnes & Noble,  look on Craigslist in the "casual encounters" section  go sit at a bar after work...    the last two options give you about 20 guys to each girl...|`|2imXzBHbaa	wear some sexy clothes, and flirt, everywhere.|`|nZ7pGQfFaa	I went online and found someone.  It only lasted a little over a year.  I am currently talking to someone I met while the person was on duty working.  I just called him at his job and left a message for him to call me back and started the conversation from there.  But i saw him often at his work place so he had a clue of who I was because I had to deal with my ex- husband there.
1KajpBdaaa	umm i wouldnt advise this but rape or get her reaaaaaaallly drunk lol   or u can marry her or ask her out|`|dZ3X26EOaa	the best way to do it is to marry her because if u dont it will seem like u are just using her for sex|`|OEaBSuaWaa	Marry her.|`|3eEuXlqsaa	There are always those that you can pay.  :]
x7iQb0r3aa	You don't. Make him miss you, if he doesn't miss you he doesn't have feelings for you as a gf. Don't act desperate.|`|nGGDddyUaa	ignore your shyness and talk to him|`|vwoqIUR6aa	just talk to him..I wouldn't get back together with him. you will be in for a ride. people break up for a reason. I am being honest and this is coming from experience|`|4XCg1mIMaa	tell him how you feel and that's it.....move on :(|`|AOBEkqzXaa	why would you want to be friends w/your ex? Move on and get some GIRL friends.|`|fNNTPqZLaa	That will hurt you, trust me.  Don't let him play with your feelings.  Save yourself from being heartbroken.|`|834IgNzRaa	I know exactly wat your going thru all yu have to do is ignore the fact that he stil has feelings for yu and jus talk to him as yu did before Yea its gonna suck but eventually yu will get used to it. Now if yu stil have feelings for him, play hard to get it ALWAYS works. Jus remember this one thing "they always come bacc wen they realize how much they REALLY miss yu"|`|nbCniQVqaa	just talk|`|4npjIcPaaa	just pretend hes one of your girlfriends. just minus the talk about boys.|`|S852p6SXaa	talk to him like you talk to him before you guys were going out..but without the flirting and the sexual vibes|`|nJSVwAxMaa	talk to him as u wuld any other friend whos a guy|`|W05lqxGHaa	wanted to be friends???    meaning he doesnt love you anymore???    thats so sad ... juz think of the things you did with him i mean happy moments ...get your strengths in there then talk to him|`|927bc079ca21793ad9f19121596a4ba1aa	Just treat him as you would treat one of your regular friends. I don't know how close your were or intimate, but treat him as you would like to be treated. Remember your friends now. You can go out with other guys. And he can go out with other girls. This can hurt, but keep your chin up and move on.|`|FdK1POvmaa	if he just wants to be friends then treat him like one. Dont try to do anything physical or speak to him on a regular bases
M8MlviOFaa	she likes you. man look dude, next time you talk to her, just ask her whats shes doing today. then ask her if she wants to hangout sometime, if not today! she'll say yeah either way. Go get some coffee together or something, get to know each other more and itll eventually lead to pleasuretown. byah!     p.s. be a confident young man too. thats the trick. remember, SHE LIKES YOU!  shes just been waiting.... godspeed my friend.
9jWjyKeuaa	As cold as it is, I've found that when there's no real way to get a point across, being blunt is the best choice.  It will be mean at first but if she truly won't say yes and he'll really get upset then it'll just benefit him in the long run.  If he doesn't believe you then let him do as he pleases, if he gets rejected maybe he'll learn to listen to you in the future.|`|4XCg1mIMaa	remind him of what happened last time and just be there for him no matter what!|`|ntqVD7Ataa	Don't tell him a word. This is something he needs to figure out on his own. Maybe if she rejects him again he'll cool down and take a look at those girls who like him.  I think it's nice that you care about him so much, though. *sarcasm not intended*|`|nbCniQVqaa	just tell her straight out|`|ujTlIn8Saa	thats just a shitty situation.|`|CBYFTjXHaa	tell him that she doesnt like him.|`|7975768afc30ab732d41bba7e2ea3a52aa	Leave it alone. Let them live and learn. Who knows, they might change their mind.|`|JurXNltPaa	Being that you are his friend just sit him down and let him know that you don't want to see him heart-broken especially so close to Valentine Day and that you already know that "Ms. Popular" is going to say no. Mention that you do know some nice girls that like him and things could go good if he may try giving one of them a chance. Explain to him that they may not be as popular etc... BUT they  are really nice. Hope that works!!|`|S852p6SXaa	remind him what happened the last time he tried to ask her out, it might seem mean but its a reality check. she sounds like one of those girls who look down on people because of their social status, why does he want to be with a girl like that anyways? im guessing shes extremely pretty.|`|QK3V6AX6aa	yikes,   just point out all of the really terrible things about her and then he will realize that he doesnt like her!|`|OadQW0btaa	Wow, that's a tough question. It's really hard to tell a good friend that the person they like don't like them back. I think that you just have to say " I really don't feel that you to would be good togethor, it's really hard for me to say this too you because I know that you care about her and I really care for you (as a friend) but she doesn't like you like that." and then you have to reinsure him that he is a good guy and there are other people out there that would love to date a wonderful person like him.  hope I was helpful|`|hbanGS3Qaa	hey chunky monky   i love ben & jerys as well  tell hem to ask her out and if she says no tell him to tell her something really bad like "well then you can kiss my a s s" or something better   like  "if you dont go with me i am gonna beat up the guy that you do go with,  so unless u want blood allover your dress you better reconsider"  tell him to walk tall and carry a big stick|`|5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	tell him plain & simple, but don't be surprised if he doesn't listen.  Most of the time we have to find these things out for ourselves.|`|QHwxYQxFaa	tell her that he is already going out with some1 else
BWttPY1taa	the  way she dress,  looks and smile but that only catches my eye not my heart. Not every guys like girls that are too sexy cos it makes the guys think the girl are too flirty.|`|s6e4bqahaa	HER EYES FOR SURE!!!  And her smile!|`|M8MlviOFaa	physically, im very attracted to caucasion girls with a nice hourglass bod. or more sickly, i like white girls with big butts.    first i look at her butt, then i look at her face. i cant explain|`|b6ccac7a047169fde765030620090cc2aa	her physical appearance..but to me her personality is also important  the girl has to have a good sense of humor and that she likes to have fun and is not boring..but if i was somewhere i would basically first look at her smile her face and her eyes...
i0WQzVDZaa	Ask her what she used to do in her old school? You know sports acting. If she answers you I hope you know a little about it. Otherwise music or movies you can't go wrong with that. Best thing to do is find out if she would like to go join up with a group of friends even if they are just yours and just hang out. Oh and make sure you listen eh.

But why would you want to look older?  I am 30 and people think I am 18.  LOL  As you get older you will love the fact that you look younger. Just think when you are 35 people will think you are 25..  That's a good thing!!  But for now, maybe try putting makeup on, or dress a little on the young adult side.|`|eJdWHgyjaa	u look 13 ish but i think that if u dyed your hair the color of ur eyebrows and put son some makeup you would look twice as old|`|iSM3wl2aaa	11|`|k1FenuRLaa	12-13|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	umm like...12 maybe|`|LoO9LptJaa	you look about 13 or 14! but, i think that if you   changed your hairstyle a little and maybe wore  more make-up/ more mature clothing, you'd look  just your age =] don't worry! you're still absolutely  gorgeous! goodluck and remember that you're  fine just the way you are! ?|`|X9xNgS4Zaa	i have heard about this: it is a disorder in which a person looks younger than they actually are, but dont worry it is nothing malignant.|`|AVz4JS69aa	12

Nonsense is...fun.  Explain?|`|HAiGuKIeaa	I agree with Karan..    But kissing is not only to express the affection or sexual feelings..

8zglJMdhaa	Well there is the probably **** version that guys LOVE, which is with the switch inside their pants ;)    Otherwise, well guys get really turned on almost for everything, a hug, a good look, let them touch you, touch them, get close to him or show him so part of you (legs boobs , etc), touch his special part, give up to him, lay next to him,Be sexy , but what would really turn me on is to a girl to lay on me or sit on me with a short skirt, WOW I would feel like the luckiest guy ever.    And becareful, we guys can do crazy things when we are turned on.|`|JFFNFfLeaa	put your feet on his lap

YK5y5m51aa	I am sure that your bf knows it that u are not a clubbing kind of person. Just remind him that clubbing isn't your thing. But because he wants u to go, u will go but wont stay long. So u get there when both of u are aware that u are not going to stay long and after like say an hour u can ask him to drop u back home. Enjoy|`|lVNYRSs8aa	ask him if there is anything fun you two could do in the city|`|PMjPpYPnaa	tell him.. but go.. u can have fun in the car :) and at the party. chill and sit dance kiss flirt.

Maybe you can go to the party and then do something for your bday on a different night. But you should do what is going to make you happy. Some of my best birthdays were just at home with a few of my best friends eating dinner, cake, and watching a movie. If he really wants to make you happy and you decide that is what you want, then he will do it for you.|`|Ag67gM8Paa	GO!
BF8GlwyDaa	defenitly long.... not way way too long... but long.... and most guys like it strait.....|`|61Fwbi79aa	I've always liked long hair, but my last g/f before this one had short hair (she had survived brest cancer) and it was very hot. If you are small, you can get away with anything, girls with a little extra might want to keep it long (but they are still sexy too!)|`|9jWjyKeuaa	It's all personal preference.  I myself prefer longer, wavy hair.  I think short hair (close to guys length) is extremely unattractive.  Straight hair is alright if it's done right.|`|9rO2VMXxaa	long. doesn;t matter strait or curly|`|Zi2Sw3ngaa	it really depends..alot of guys like long..but i dont mind short either..
n53HeORBaa	yes your friends are being heartless, they should not stoop down and hurt your emotions like that, true friends understand each other and if they do fight they keep their emotions in check, careful about the words that might get out of their mouths and might regret later, so of i were you just distance yourself you need to find new bunch of friends that won't treat and make you feel like crap|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	Look, they're cruel and heartless. They sound absolutely HORRIFIC.  You NEED to find better friends!  They are hurting you, and they're OVERLY judgemental.  All they will do is slowly ruin your life.  Try to find some other friends, ones that aren't absolute jerks.  Those girls need to get over themselves!  I doubt you're even fat.  Especially not ugly.  Just try not to listen to them, and meet better people.  Good luck. :)|`|ad7ae5e8f17688d3566fad454e8fc09baa	It's best to try to find new friends because they aren't worth trying to be friends with|`|alzLolbZaa	They arnt true friends at all!! You would be better without them hun. And when you leave them, they will be sorry, and come crawling bac kto you, and you will say no to their faces, and paugh with the good friends you have!! :)|`|Ck2AhfTRaa	well i dont know what its like to have a twin, but two things come to mind about that. first, it must be hard knowing your twin died becuase twins are very close even in the womb and so you are missing like half of yourself. and my best friend and i have been best firend for 8 years and when i got married and had a baby and she was still dating, i felt left out. sometimes we fought when i visited her too. but eventually she had a baby and married and so i feel one with her again. now i know you cant have your sister back or somehow feel included when you are never going to have another twin and her twin isnt dying, but you are in common with them. you have a twin (even if she isnt here) and not alot of people do. so what if shes gone?! your here without her right? make the best of it. :)    also, when my best friend didnt call to tell me for about a week that her baby was born, i got mad. but i didnt fight with her about ti cause i know that she is almost the only friend i have now that all my HS friends are off to college and i live somewhere else.i cant lose her friendship.  your freinds were so mean. but be strong ok?  you have been this long without her and you can do it. dont let them get you down. no more revengeful comments to your freinds. go over to them and tell them(with honest feelings) that you are sad and hurt by the way they(your best freidns) are being and that you want them to stop so you can all get along agin. tell them they are the only best freidns that you have and maybe they wil stop. if they dont, dont be afraid of them... you can either let your feelings of greif and sadness show and let them feel guilty (if they get that way) and hopefully it wont get you down...  or you can be superwoman and show them it doesnt bother you (without being mean back) and hope they realise that they should be nice. but whichever you choose do not be the one to ruin it. if they do than that is their choice, but let them see you care enough to work on the relationship. keep tryin!
TF6Tk3vHaa	if you really love your ex.. it will be took long period of time.. but if you will have someone to love you can get over her in just a week or month.. in my situation we already broke for 3 months but i am not yet ready to have a relationship again because i dont want to get hurt anymore..  but its up to you.. it will depend..|`|mvaPdekPaa	im stilll trying to figure tht out. so far its been a week... :( but then again we really were only together for like a month... so any day now.|`|5IA9Qe2aaa	depends how serious it was i guess|`|76XzBbrOaa	I'm still not over my ex and its been 6 months! we were dating for almost a year. love sucks. everyone says it takes time. i think it depends on how much u saw each other and how close and serious u were.|`|WSIZKAQcaa	It's been 2 months for me, I'm still trying to get over him. Sorry to say.
ZIq2IzOmaa	Any size within the range of normalcy works just fine for most women. So something between 5 and 7 inches (with most men falling between 5 and 6) is perfectly adequate.     Outside of this range, partners can still have satisfying sex, it may just require more skill and technique to get the same results.     How well a man is using his equipment and how into the experience his partner is are far more important factors than size. You can have a 7 1/2 inch penis, but if you don't use it correctly, you are going to hurt someone.     Sex is not about sizes or meeting goals. It's about two people enjoying an experience together.|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	depends on the vagina, depending on size it could hurt.  i think the girth (circumference) is more important than length|`|OcCgUsmLaa	Yes it matters. Give me a nice 8-9 incher thats nice and thick any day. I don't care how well a guy with a teeny weeny works it, it ain't happening for me. I like big hard ones and want to feel every inch. People who say it doesn't matter, are either guys with little ones, or women trying to justify why they married a guy with a small one.    S|`|hVuIySZ9aa	performance matters.as some of my naughty friends would say,"whats the use of a big "firearm" if you don't know how to "aim & shoot" it right(or even how to fire it up?)he he!!|`|1KajpBdaaa	quote from robin hood the men in tights "its not about the size its about how u use it!!"|`|5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	I hate to say it, but yes, it does.  I have been around the block a few times & have enjoyed dating quite a few guys (call me what you like)...but I have to say that there is a range of "perfect" that makes sex way more enjoyable; like 8 - 10 inches & thick.  Don't get me wrong, if he doesn't know what the f he's doing then it doesn't matter.|`|UBJkmXVhaa	Of course it matters to some extent--a very small penis might be non-functional, a very large penis might not fit inside the vagina.     That said, I think the range within which a "satisfying" size falls is pretty wide, and is different for every woman (after all, the size of every vagina is different).|`|O1lm79EFaa	I personally think it's more about girth....    I wouldn't want a 13inch long pencil.... barf|`|qZQq68BCaa	Not really. Atleast I don't care and I don't think it should matter.    Danea|`|17Fx86WVaa	Thickness does, but length doesnt matter all that much to me but you cant be too small|`|63523fe328f802fb48e9062684b80aebaa	NO! Bigger does not mean better.  My hubby is huge but the sex is horrific.  I have had smaller guys and really small guys who have really given me weak knees.|`|7975768afc30ab732d41bba7e2ea3a52aa	Remember a Vagina is a muscle. To work your vagina into shape to accomodate ANY size Penis is the real trick. Out of shape Vaginas will give a man much work. Does size matter? No...Have the girl work it!|`|AA10263183	average is probably 5-6 inches    but its mainly about how thick it is    width > length|`|6livpFsBaa	yes for most men but no with most women.  it's better to be normal size    Studies of penis size show the 'average' erect penis ranges from 5 to 7 inches (13 to 16 cms) with a girth of about 4 inches (10 cms).    An average non-erect penis ranges between 2 to 4 inches (5 to 10 cms). Very few men have longer than average penises when erect.    is your penis below average?    you can increase penis size by taking drugs and exercise.    if you want to increase it by exercising try the web here:    http://track.moreniche.com/hit.php?w=144...      i hope that help you
yTB2Zdx6aa	no you arent bf/gf, none of you have asked eachother out yet|`|OdTLUprzaa	Aw that's cute. But it really just means that you two are interested in each other and ready to consider if you want to date. In order for you to be boyfriend and girlfriend, you would both have to agree to date exclusively. You should keep talking and stuff and then figure out where it leads, making sure that you are on the same page. Yeah, he's probably shy about it and freaking out too (I hate that guys think there is some rule about how much time they have to wait before calling a girl). But don't worry, he's thinking about you like crazy too.  Yeah lots of times it is awkward after two people confess their feelings for each other. But that will go away the more time you spend together, don't worry. Good luck!|`|oLI2SJ08aa	Liking each other does not mean you're boyfriend and girlfriend. Call him, set up a date. Or you can skip to the whole "so...are we boyfriend-girlfriend now?" conversation.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	ohhhh, that's really sweet. he just might be waiting to call you and is a little nervous.|`|DqVcQ5kXaa	i think|`|NLxcfGplaa	OMG you guys are so cute.

He probably doesn't know what to do right now so the next time you guys talk try not to be the shy one.|`|7e6ZjOqiaa	lol i dont call the other person first phone talk is awkward for me :/  but i havnt had to much luck and im 15 probaly a late bloomer too :(|`|2imXzBHbaa	why dont you txt him|`|DwTrJ9GTaa	no your not boyfriend and girl friend but give him a call thank him for hanging out lqast night se if he wants to do something in a couple of days|`|L2pkns9maa	Kiss him... then ask him what does it mean... and the youll be boyfriend and girlfriend|`|AeLzqfS4aa	well there are two possibilities that come from this  1.) he is going to play the player and not call you for a couple of days  2.)or hell call you any minute.  just relax and if he calls he calls if he don't, dont worry about it his loss.|`|AA12302875	You totally need to call him.     It's really great that you had the courage to tell him that. Tell me how you did it because I'm having a problem with that as well.     But, if you have already told him and he has told you he likes you in return, then you need to go for it. If he's shy you need to take the initiative.     I don't think you guys are quite "boyfriend/girlfriend' until either of you ask to be.     But you may think you guys are going out if that's how its done wherever you are.|`|l89OAs6qaa	well you guys arent until you date.  which might start since you guys said you liked each other.|`|nbCniQVqaa	you are not bf and gf just wait until you see him again|`|mFkfJwLOaa	ask him out, you know hes going to say yes, so ask to go somewhere to break the ice|`|cpjPt2Zeaa	you guys arnt until its official|`|C0cOc7Ifaa	No i don't think you guys are together yet but you sure can be now that both of you know each others crush|`|8WZkicbVaa	trust me everything for the first time is awkward :) he is probably feeling the same as you.

It's something that you two will just have to talk about, but you're definitely "together."  I'd say you're dating, cause personally I think that's really all that is required but in a similar situation I was involved in with a girl we both liked each other, were far enough into a relationship to kiss, and still weren't "dating" cause there was no official question and whatnot.  That situation had a little more behind it though, so you guys are probably on the right track.  Just take it slow early on, get some clarification when you guys are fully comfortable, and best of luck with the relationship. =)|`|G4sA2MGFaa	According to "guy rules" he won't call for a few days. Stay away from your phone, don't act desperate, no calling him or texting. Just hang back and watch it all unfold, if he really likes you, you will know by his actions. Take your time, if you've waited this long it won't kill you and wait till you have the relationship talk before you tell people you are a couple.|`|naijqNojaa	no idea  good luck|`|Brcp97V7aa	Make the first approach. You told him you liked him but that's just step one... Call him. Text him. Meet up somewhere. Ask him out he knows you like him and you know he likes you nothing can go wrong unless you really don't trust him, since you were driving around with him in his car I think you can trust him so Ask him out or just wait...     1st approach always works for me!!!|`|jggRn9YVaa	Guy's always wait the second or third day to call we have to think things over and we don't want to be to think we are hard up that is how I am with women keep them wanting more. For a example when he calls you he say's I have something for you or I have something to tell you when I see you. This is something that you look forward to seeing us again we always want to keep you guessing.
1KajpBdaaa	wat u sayin there? that a guy who likes anime should be dumped automatically? wtf? i like anime...and guys who actually cares about their gf is hard to find most of the guys nowadays only want sex|`|4fC6EJWfaa	learn how to write!|`|3rDbLSZBaa	learn to spell|`|yuwjQjKqaa	Only if you want 2!|`|2bkS1VIIaa	one thing a lot of people like anime like me i love it and that's something he dosent like something you like and he probably screams like a girl to make you laugh and it dosent matter if his friend hates you|`|bkgBLjuvaa	follow your heart, if you don't feel like you like him anymore leave him.|`|aNN4BtgSaa	y should it matter wat his friends think and if he likes another girl who cares all boys do even if they r goin out with u so i wouldnt. hope this helped|`|lVNYRSs8aa	if a guy cares THAAAAAAAAAT much for you    you better have a good reason for dumping him cause they're hard to find, trust me|`|Fe2sw7rjaa	make him wear some panties. take some control!
ULSxEr4caa	No no no no no. Just because your friend is doing it, that is no reason you should! Please, save it. Save your first time for someone you truly love and do it when you feel ready. Couples should not act like that in public. It is really disgusting and no one wants to see that. It does feel good, but it is not something to be thrown around like it's nothing. That is called being a ****. Don't rush into anything and don't let anyone pressure you into going against what you feel. |`|GWU3Mclnaa	I know you will hate to hear this,but 13 and 14 are awfully young to be having sex. Being a teenager is hard enough, and emotional enough, without complicating this further; sex is a major complication. Don't feel pressured to have sex just because your friend is behaving this way.  Also, if her boyfriend is 19, then that's statutory rape in pretty much every state. And no, couples are not supposed to behave like that in public; that just shows her immaturity. You don't want your first time to be some guy that came to "help you out". You aren't a leaky faucet, no need to call a repairman to help you out. It sounds like you have your head in the right place, just stay true to yourself. Your friend's problems are just begining.|`|G1ZZkAc4aa	You have to ask?  You are way too young to be having sex.  And if a girl does that in public, then it's sick. It's not normal.  Just a little slutty, excuse me.|`|KRDwCai5aa	no, don't do it.  just wait, it'll be better for you in the long run.|`|lIfeAsb3aa	Oh God, please don't.  Especially if you don't even know what she is even talking about.|`|MkchPOjFaa	nooo...for many reasons..your too young...you shouldnt do something just cuz everyone else is..thats too big of a repsonsibility for you too handle ex.pregnacy but thats the least of your worries theres STDs and HIV/AIDS...there is STDs that you can get that can damage your uterous and u can NEVER have kids...save your self for someone you love that loves you..trust mi i have alot of friends that say they regret it..mi myself i saved my self for that special someone and were planning on marriage and im gonna be 19 in april...save yourself please dont do nuffin you dont want to cuz ya dumass friend wants you too....    P.S MAKE NEW FRIENDS IMMEDIATLY|`|M5XjqI40aa	No, wait until you are ready. She's acting like a ****.|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	she's immature!! especially doin that sh*t in public  sorry if its your friend and you disagree but she is, and she is just acting like a wh*re  if she is a friend she wouldn't be telling you to do something that could really mess up your life  hers is already, he is just using her  dont get me wrong sex is good, but you really shouldn't that young  it comes with a lot of consequences  especially with some random person|`|17Fx86WVaa	no trust me youll regret it|`|1KajpBdaaa	are u f-in serious!!! ure friend is a ho dont start havin sex
kOb0gOGUaa	lol hon u need to calm down and just wait for him to say something. i'm sure he'll say something soon so don't worry bout it lol n if not then just say something to him by the end of this week.|`|PXimiZCdaa	You would know if you liked him, and a romantic relationship with him will eventually fail. Youll just have to tell him you want to be friends.
HjMbOgvqaa	Get a copy of your birth certificte and ignore your brother and sister they are playing mind games with you.talk to your mom one on one when they are not around.|`|1n3Cm4u7aa	work secretly first,then when you think you had enough money,run and run.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	talk to your 'mom' about this and tell her that you want to know and that you have a right to know. its mean of them to lead you on and drop hints about it and then not tell you. you have more of a right to know than they do. and sorry about your dad. good luck!|`|IZJSuShbaa	you should get the thruth...  ask/demand your mom(?) to clear things up for you|`|HjPt0V8Eaa	maybe you could ask your past friend or any related close one. They might know how to describe your past and somehow you would know your identity.|`|GeUAhqXpaa	dam that would really piss me off too!!!    are you the youngest?    i say you take one of ur smaller siblings and pin them against a wall and demand or you'll break there face or something      i owuld reall just call them all togethere and demand to know!!!
wCXY3MJ2aa	It is an addiction like any other. Recovery is a long process. You don't kick the habit over night.   When he said he will stop, he meant he will make sure he doesn't leave traces behind, like clearing the history, cookies and temp folders.|`|WewCtMpzaa	Nope, they just work on improving their hiding skills. It's silly to expect a man to give up his stash, whether it's Playboys, real Porn, Internet Porn or whatever.    So many women think they reform their guys on porn. I have seen guys buy it at a porn shop, and whack off at the store or in their cars, then throw it away. I have seen guys buy a second laptop just for porn. It's amazing what a guy will do to keep their porn in hand...    The vast majority of guys look at porn. Even the super Christian types because it makes them feel good. It releases hormones that is a cheap high. It's kind of like chocolate to most women. It's short and sweet.    It's only and addiction if he whacks off more than twice a day, and regularly at that. It's all fantasy, and it starts from the teenage years, and pretty much goes on until death. It can improve a marriage if it's brought into the bedroom in a healthy way. It can also destroy. It is a reality that all marriages face, and if done right, it will be okay.    There are times I check out the sex personals. Not because I am looking, but more out of curiosity. What makes it okay to me is I share it with my wife. I love to browse the swingers on Craigslist, and other personal sites, not that I want to swing deep down, but rather love to see how others try to do it, and the pictures they post. It can be some real entertainment.|`|m13CCGc1aa	AFF is not just looking at naked pics.  It's looking at naked pics of people who are looking to meet up for a good time.  If he wont' stop looking at sites with real people looking to hook up, then it is only a matter of time before he starts naughty chat then meets up with someone else.|`|cfiXSkE0aa	omg! ur sick! does ur wife know?!?!?! sicko!|`|S2FhDtfSaa	Sure. But it might depend on the reason he is looking. If it was to satisfy curiosity, there is no problem. If he is really looking for another partner, then there are problems in his marriage I think.|`|msKHbeCzaa	Guys are just gross. My husband looks at porn sometimes too, I don't really care. As long as he's not going out and actually touching other women, I don't care if he touches himself haha.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	nope and don't ever believe he will no matter what he says. u got to compromise with him cause u cant expect him to never  look at porn. this aff deal is a no no|`|rydsklvWaa	No! My dad said he'd stop, but all he's done is do a better job at clicking out of the windows.|`|63523fe328f802fb48e9062684b80aebaa	Yes, my husband did.  But beware of taking away this privalige because once you give it back its like taking a leash of a dog...they run back to the porn with a vengence.|`|WchGezIAaa	no. not without ALOT of work and commitment.  Pornography is VERY addictive.  people often underestimate it.    perhaps you should get a counceller involved so you can sort it out properly.|`|VeDJa0m9aa	sure, that was my new year's resolution. If he has something better to look at home, then he can do it.|`|aqj4E7Aeaa	You mean stop looking at hot women and settle for their wife who has a fupa?    Doubt it.|`|Ro2ObPXlaa	Maybe....he might need counseling.|`|ojxOpAQmaa	Yes they can. I used to look at porn etc. and this was because my wife of the time was not very willing in the bedroom, however my new partner is the opposite, she is most willing and inventive, she has shown me a thing or too. Why would I go to these sites, when it is at home, and it is real.|`|ElBIeRFNaa	i doubt it.  my BIL is an addict and still can't get over it...even with counseling.|`|6b7eeb4f41fa6f871211ccd21d079e24aa	No way!!!!
zxq5QhNtaa	Well you might have scared her off, but no one would admit it to someones face if they had been scared off. So just give her time to 'want you' because if you start first then you seem desperate. Or it might be possible that she is struggling with being bi because during high school a lot of girls are unsure about their sexuality.    I would say she was interested but you might have rocked the boat a little too hard. You just have to wait for her to chase you.|`|p6IGALzbaa	Well, I've been there and done that. It can mean many things.  Maybe she is going through something and has been too busy to get online. Sometimes people have things going on in life that they don't tell anyone about, then they repel from people.   Or maybe she isn't as much into you as you are into her.   Or she could just be the same way. Maybe she doesn't want to get online/on the phone with you too much because she doesn't want to get tired of you or you get tired with her.  It could also be possible that she has someone but she doesn't want to tell you because she doesn't want to hurt you.  I really hope this works out though!  I'm pretty sure she likes you, but there is no way to know for sure.  Anyways, hope I helped.   You should talk to her about it.
vHB9zUcCaa	this may B a hard/bitter pill 2 swallow, & it may B hard 2 accept, but there's such a law as patients' right NOT 2 accept medical treatment. if he wants 2 die, that's his right by law. all u CAN do is pray 4 him. "u can lead a horse 2 water, but u can't make him drink it."|`|0ff374a75a28871da57473c4784e0eeeaa	tell him that you think he needs to get help, that you are concerned! good luck, I will keep you and your father in my prayers!!
VP7KAe12aa	True love exists, because a mother will always love there child. How the sun loves the moon and earth. How people can love one another by just seeing them once. Love like that! haha but it's way to hard to explain it because there is no proof only here say. You know what I mean? We all may experience but we don't know what it really is. We are only predicting what it is.  Good question but hard to answer!
WyCmQBuvaa	Politely thank her for asking you and including you, but tell her that you can't afford the dress and all that stuff.  I wouldn't bring up the 1/2 sister thing.|`|6RqjxUTnaa	It whouldnt be mean it would be selfish.She is your sister and needs your support just because you don't want to do all that stuff and pay for it. Ask her if she will pay for it or ask your mom or dad. Talk to your sister about this Chances are she is going to get pretty mad! just calmly tell her how you feel ,and then Decide. you better hurry ,and make your decision though. Hope this Helps|`|KwNpyp3saa	I think you should make the effort and keep the peace. If you are having trouble financially then maybe you can bring this up and this can be your out.
nZ7pGQfFaa	When I was your age I dated guys 17 - 19.  As long as your parents don't mind, then go for it. But be careful, they can get arrested if sex is involved.|`|3kKlGfy7aa	stay under 17 so if you decide to take a step further it wont be rape and watch out who you date with!!|`|yuwjQjKqaa	No I think its fine as long as they don't use you for sex.
m0IVQxG1aa	Im not sure, if I was the lady in question I'd probably think that you were just joking.  Try asking her out in a cute/creative way, we fall for that kind of stuff.  Good Luck, I hope she's the right one for you =]|`|puUStDPpaa	hah she prolly thinks you like her|`|ddWyRjmVaa	I would take that as innocent flirting. Just playing around. I do that to all my guy friends! lol  |`|dKwDJ7qAaa	some people are pretty dull.you should just go and tell her.cuz guys hit on girls allllll the time.at the point where girls can take hints when guys like them.(i know cuz im one of theses girls!) ...hope it goes well with the girlxxx|`|Hbxsq22daa	I don't know one girl who wouldn't see that as a hint :)|`|ZLImHFvWaa	yah...i think so.....i told my mom that and got the hint and bought me my ps3,,,,,,joke,,,,,,but she got the hint alright but it still depends if what type of girl she is,,,,|`|hbanGS3Qaa	no women are idiots they never get the message  you should have told her she need to spend more time on the stair climber  and that she is fat  that always works.  and tell her she looks ok or so so   they love that stuff.|`|zyTvtgS2aa	you might just want to tell her upfront.  so theres no confusion|`|CruxCjIraa	yeah she prolly got the hint|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	a guy friend would say that, but she might have got an idea|`|vwoqIUR6aa	yeah she knows you like her. she likely thinks you ar sleezy too|`|Dm9ouXV9aa	Well, I think what a girl really wants to hear is that she's beautiful, or that she looks amazing, or even gorgeous. Or you could say "You are perfect the way you are." The word sexy, (which some girls may find flattering if they just want attention from guys) is not a really meaningful compliment if they are looking for a real relationship. Personally, I would hate it if guys used only "sexy" to describe me.|`|AA11375230	a goat wouldve gotten the hint.    or she thinsk you mean stay fat.|`|luzxbhuHaa	Thats kinda a major line between friends and liking, unless you are really good friends with her.      How did she respond?|`|fBdtvrWdaa	Uh yeah she got the hint haha. None of my friends ever called me sexy! She knows you are into her :)|`|lVNYRSs8aa	unless you're a joking type of a guy she definitely got the hint|`|8WZkicbVaa	yes, or she is like WTF!!! you have to be open and tell her how you feel, nothing is worse than when a guy says something like that and then not follow it up!|`|zCnydScPaa	she most likely got the hint, but try talking to her in words of beautiful, or gorgeous. i love it when i guy doesnt call me hott, and stuff like that.(:|`|QK3V6AX6aa	of course she got the hint!     good luck
zzaScg0haa	just give him time
wnb0EgaHaa	Imo, the eyes are the mirrors to the soul...there's nothing more incredible than looking into the eyes of the person you love, and while making love, it just adds to the intensity to be able to see how he's feeling - another way of connecting.|`|5ILdSx7faa	If definately makes the love making more intense but what is better is to look into each others eyes while having the orgasam.  Now that's intense.|`|J4W68owgaa	It is awkward sometimes, but when you just feel close and intimate and your are bombarded with loving thoughts and feelings, it brings it to a much higher level. It's vulnerable and it just intensifies everything.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	What exactly would "any particular" mean?    It can be very intmate to lock your gaze during lovemaking.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	I guess it depends because some peoples eyes go east and west....lol|`|63523fe328f802fb48e9062684b80aebaa	I don't know why but when you like the person alot and you're really enjoying the moment, looking into that person's eyes makes everything more orgasmic.  Just from experience.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	There is only one way to find out when the spouse is really way up there in pure ecstasy. Not sure if you can get brain locked out like this.|`|GGSSxFsUaa	LMAO! Thinking of those sex faces!    I think it increases the intensity and adds a little more passion.|`|FyFDp5Jlaa	Is different|`|MsSHhX8zaa	It makes it more intimate...something only real lovers do, not just people who have sex with random people. It brings the connection to a deeper level.
bksWoXV1aa	What about a tree branch? I wander how they did it too.|`|3892ff0d005ca0e7cc3e0bb1045ba012aa	The weirdest place for me was while driving a car- he was driving, I was riding. And it was stick- needless to say we stalled it a few times and no we didn't get caught by anyone. hee hee|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	supermarket and no|`|cPpP4BZIaa	Sex in the back of my truck, and yes the police caught us. We were in a park when is was closed.|`|N4KyJ8aVaa	in the back of a taxi, and yes the driver saw.. he didn't seem to mind though. strange little man.     on the back of a bus, driver didn't see . other people did|`|AA11108018	In the laundry mat in  broad day light|`|BBlfetz3aa	in a church bathroom, and no.    in a parked car and yes by cops.    on the sofa while her parents were on the other sofa and no.  that last one took skill. slow and quiet|`|I0g24Jmkaa	geeze, someone was desperate.....|`|63523fe328f802fb48e9062684b80aebaa	The men's bathroom in a Theater and no I did not get caught.|`|H1UzYl8haa	in the movies  in the park(under brooklyn bridge lol)  public bathrooms    think thats it, not really wierd    howd you get away wl it in a waiting room girl? ;]|`|tHeHVGE1aa	End zone of my high school football field .. and no|`|7InYcUSUaa	taxi cabb && shoppping cart in a parking lott  \=]    IM FIESTY|`|zxq5QhNtaa	A trampoline. And we got caught but only by our friends. Pretty embarassing when we were bouncing up and down naked and you friends come outside to basically a porno. lol.
LbvRxf2jaa	It's not tacky - it's reasonable...I think anyways.    Who cares though - it's your wedding, your life - if your guests want to help you out you can put it towards whatever you want.    If you're worried, maybe sign up for an account or use a moneybox and then put the money towards the honeymoon by yourself....that way those who don't like the idea will have no say in how you spend your money - and you'll still get the gifts...|`|F6xQcVbtaa	I think it is a great way to go, especially if you already have things you need.  I would register at a store as well, so the traditional guests can choose.  Then let your family and friends spread the word about how you are hoping the people will give to the honeymoon registry so that you can enjoy a wonderful honeymoon.  Sometimes when people hear that from those who are close to you, it helps.    I have a link below to an article I wrote about how to sign up for a honeymoon wedding registry, and a link to the one I found to be the most reputable.  Some honeymoon registries were free, but they required guests to create an account or sign up with PayPal or another payment service.  While that seems okay, at the same time, I know that if I were giving a gift, I would feel burdened by the extra steps.    Good luck and have fun!|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	It's not a good idea to ask for financial gifts. If you don't need gifts, that's wonderful. A wedding reception should be you treating your nearest and dearest to a great party.  Bottom line: tacky to ask for monetary gifts.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	A lot of people are still very old fashioned and may take offense.  I think it is a great idea to give a gift that the bride and groom will really use.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	I think it's great!!! However, there are still some older people who get offended at the thought of ANY kind of registry so this may push them a little too far.  I would make this a secondary registry and still have a typical store registry for those stick in the mud kind of people.(even if it's a tiny one).  You could always upgrade some things.|`|WtzKQVGXaa	I would do it... cause it is a second marriage and people already figure you have a toaster so this way they can get you something that you will really use.|`|tBODwcqXaa	This is a popular trend nowadays-- especially in this economy. I don't think there is anything tacky about it. I would, however, give guests the "ok" to buy other gifts as well. Good luck!|`|Uy8ntukjaa	It is optional. A great way to do this tactfully is to include your gift registry information with the hotel and travel information you would normally supply your guests. If people choose to give you a gift instead be gracious and delighted to receive what they choose to give.|`|NU8Z0Rulaa	As obsessed as I am with etiquette and not offending my future family, we're registering for a honeymoon. We're grown adults and have been living together for quite a while. We don't really need anything but a nice vacation and a chance to make some great memories together. My MIL is in charge of spreading the word about our honeymoon registry. However, if people should show up with other gifts... well, that's what gift receipts are for! All kidding aside, I don't think it is tacky at all, and if that is what the two of you want, go for it!
e7I0PXBNaa	Wow its sounds like you have some drama coming your way. I would suggest you keep dating "the strong silent" guy. As far as the new guys is concerned, you should let him know your in a relationship and you can only be friends... I think the  ultimate question is do you like the new guy more than your bf? When it comes to his ex, make sure she knows that you will be fighting for him too. You have the advantage because he likes you. Try to keep it as friendly as possible though,  because she did hook you guys up!  To take some heat off, I would try and find someone for her to like instead... try and hook her up with someone else. Good Luck!
oil8ALh4aa	I think its possible for you two to be in love  If he's trying for you  then he must love you|`|UY4P6UFxaa	Well according to your description..  i think he loves you, and yes love can be at 18.  and it could last if you guys fight for it :D    Also yes even if he does go to college, you could still always call him and make plans to see each other    (answer mine please?)|`|Fe2sw7rjaa	ask him to wear your panties. if he does thats some love since he would be doing it for your pleasure|`|I0g24Jmkaa	sounds like you guys will be fine, he sounds passionate about you, but only time will tell between things.|`|S852p6SXaa	"He tells me he loves me" theres your answer.|`|834IgNzRaa	Only yu can know if your in love, no one can tel yu wat age to fall in love! Love is all about changes and and co he trying to change for YU (that's sweet) it cant be anything but l.o.v.e trust me. If he really loves yu as much as he says, then wen he goes to college he wil talk an try to see yu every chance he gets. Best of luck to yu!!!!!!!!!!!|`|WKxnAHpjaa	yes u can be in love at 18 love has no age. i am 18 and my boyfriend is 20 and he goes to a college 7 hours away and we are still deeply in love i talk to him ever chance i get.
I2xILJtraa	it know its horrible and i dont blame you for your behaviour. First off if my mom got remarried i would like never talk to her again just because she knows how sensitive i am to things like that.Anyway i think you should talk to your mom about how hes treating you. And you should tell him that you have your own rights and can love his family if you want too:)|`|HjMbOgvqaa	They all aren,t just some ,maybe he thinks you are not accepting him,my grand daughter got a great step mom and my daughter has taken on 4 as well as her own 3 and they are doing great ,this is coming from the oldest girl and what i see.I had a step witch so i know how you feel.|`|IZJSuShbaa	not all are horrible  they're just trying to be a parent and enforce rules  and are prob afraid you wont listen and think they're a push over if they're easy  BUT some are nuts and just mean i know.|`|3ae438759d1f82f0733d2a5dc01aba4daa	i know it sucks , have a step parent around but you just have to respect them. once your 18 you can leave
Aw9ADXGPaa	I'm (kinda) shy too!Ok! give him hints that you like him. since he likes you try and be more forward but slowly. If you take on your shyness and terror for him it will go away and about the mean girl. Ignore her girls like her will never get to experience what it's like to have a boyfriend that likes her for her not her popularity!

5HtaeJPtaa	Risking a friendship for a romantic relationship is particularly scary if you don't know if that friends is attracted to you in that way. It's usually best to have a casual and open conversation about it - without any pressure from you.     For example, try starting the conversation out with something like, "Hey Katie, I just wanted to talk to you about something I've been thinking about. I hope this doesn't freak you out, and if it does, we can totally pretend like we never talked about it."    She'll probably then ask, "what?"    And you can tell her the truth at this point, but pay attention to how she reacts. If it seems like you are making her too nervous and she doesn't feel the same way about you, make a joke out of it and tell her not to worry about it. And then drop it. Forever. Some friendships are best kept as friendships. But you'll never know until you try. You can start telling her the truth after she's asks what with, "I've started getting feelings for you, and I'm not sure if I should just ignore those feelings or if you might feel the same way."    Remember to keep it casual and relaxed. No pressure!    Good luck!
1Z0Lmrk1aa	Sounds to me like your home sick and the guy you like is back there too right? Can you get tuition money to go to school back home? I would do that if you can. Oh and tell the friend your not interested in him romantically.
5vOV8XVhaa	dont be a stripper,
CuJjdTVXaa	give him a trip on a mystery train.....tickets to a play or concert he might like....or maybe just a nice diner with his favorite sister would do...good luck|`|a7rfA9Shaa	damnn, i was gettin ready to say alcohol!! lol.    Ugh, well idk.  Cd.  Wactch er somethingg.  Clothes..? lol.  Guitar Hero!! Haha.  Concert tickets    Hmph,, ill think of more.|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	Get a Birthday card...and inside get him a gift card to a place that he likes going to...or...make a scrap book of pics of him and u growing up...trust me he will keep that for life
0ehkP9qMaa	Yep. Flirting though her leg pointing at you doesn't mean much unless she was kicking you or something :-P|`|COmp4sIuaa	Haha, you're in grade 7, aren't you?|`|AFNgR9jTaa	Sounds like she might have been, talk to her|`|yTB2Zdx6aa	no i can tell that you arent ingrade seven, and she might be, but girls, flirt with lots of, guys all that time
YuYSL0A2aa	nope, sorry marriage is all about give and take. They have to change some and so do you. It's unrealistic to think you will stay the same way forever married or not, but especially if you chose to marry.   And if you did enter marriage with these traits and never changed.....well you couldn't expect whoever you married to change at all either. I doubt you would like the results.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	You can find someone who will stretch to meet many/most of your easy items:  alcohol, taking good care of stuff, etc.    No real man with any kind of drive is going to respond well to a woman who won't compromise on sex.  Meaning if every time you are "not in the mood" your attitude is "don't touch me".      Don't get married til you grow up.|`|61Fwbi79aa	Nope. Give it up. You are in love with you|`|ljwJr6u8aa	as long as you go out with very insecure men that are pooty whipped you will be fine.|`|m13CCGc1aa	Marriage takes compromise and sharing.  There is pretty much no such thing as "my money."  Sometimes goals won't be achieved because you have to sacrifice for someone else.    The only way you could make it work is if you found someone who let you walk all over them or found someone just like you.|`|hp1dbME4aa	Honestly, I would wait. I'm married now, and wish I'd waited MUCH longer...All the things that irritate you about a man will get WORSE with marriage. Wait a long time...discuss these issues with your guy and then see what you can agree & compromise on. Men WILL NOT work on anything after marriage, so get him how you want him before marriage or move on to someone else.|`|DIwflbskaa	In a marriage, each person need to gives up something in order to make it last.  But looking at your list, you don't want to to give up anything.  I think you are a person that prefer 100% isolation.|`|3caq6SFxaa	The list really has a couple of very bad for marriage things on it to be honest-the my money is my money is not good but an be compromised by setting up finances for you using some of your money and letting your husband do the same with the rest going into a joint household account.  No that is not something I believe in or have done but some couples find that works for them.  The stubborn and my way o the highway will not allow you to be married for a lengthy time unless you get a very weak man and brow beat him into submission which I do not think is what you want. Being impatient nad having the short temper is not a killer for marriages but what is if you also hold a grudge.  Marriage is a partnership and that is something you will need to do and if you can't give up anything then you have problems ahead and will find it difficult to have any long term relationship whether marriage or dating.  A lot of the rest is true to some degree for everyone-I know I do things that irritate my wife and yes she gets mad blows up but we discuss things and get over it.
VbrvE128aa	Ok, every guy is different. Maybe in his case its a test. Or Something could be wrong. You shudnt jus give him the silent treatment back but dont text him anymore. Maybe you should call and leave a voice mail then you wont have to wonder did he get your text or anything you will know you left a message and he has no other choice but to see it. I think time will tell, but if nothing is wrong and he doesnt call you back, dont worry about it. Its plenty of other guys out there. He will call one day if he was really into you but if he doesnt you know he wasnt being honest! Gud luk|`|O1lm79EFaa	Yeah... I wouldn't advise on texting him again. Keep yourself busy distract yourself from it...;    Since you weren't OFFICIALLY dating... you're not his gf... rather just someone he would hang with  So... he doesn't really HAVE to text you back... it's common courtesy but...    Maybe he's just not that into you all of a sudden... a lot of guys get like that|`|IhhDwGBmaa	whats up with people nowadays.. you texted him? how about GIVE HIM A DAMN CALL if he means that much to you, what if for some odd reason he can't receive texts? yeah play games with him and give him the silent treatment, smart.  you've been seeing him for only a month, if you aren't persistant or just decide to play games with him then both of you are just going to keep distancing away from each other.  the window is getting smaller everyday, good luck.|`|nC92yqx7aa	It's all a test. If you like him, text him or call him.|`|AA10030560	just wait and see what happens!
1KajpBdaaa	ill do u gladly|`|qQsjM6O3aa	you have not been active since you were six.  thats wrong.|`|JuCdq3hoaa	*sigh*  Another little girl trying to play with the big girls.|`|sEUnAmv6aa	no officer
GHZnLiYvaa	If your really interested in the person you want to propose, you don't need to know how to propose a girl. Just be yourself, don't show off or pretend something which your not, say it when you mean it in just 3 simple words-"I love you". Though they sound simple, but when you mean them, you would know these words hold a lot of meaning. If you wanna flirt with someone, you can try anything that doesn't sound too cheesy and kinda "hard to get".It depends upon the girl too.   I used these lines and these are mine-" I've heard that love is painful, and I wanna contradict this being in love with you." I was flirting when I said so, and she accepted. But later on when we fall in love, I realized what do these lines mean! Good luck!|`|PytLSmi8aa	A girls nature is most wonderful creation. She can love like there is no tomorrow and hate like you wish you would die. She can be a protector, a healer a creator and a destroyer. For proposing a girl, certain things have to be kept in mind. It is a bit tricky but not impossible. Some ideas for proposal to a girl.    Know your girl well, before you pop the question.    All girls love flowers. So get a huge bouquet of roses and tell her how much you love her and how much she means to you.    Tell her "you look beautiful" when she does not have any make. Tell her she looks amazing when she is having a bad day.    Girls love to be pampered when you intend to propose, make her feel special. Women want a strong man, not a wimp.    Don't force her to say yes. Tell her to take her time and that you shall wait. Be a gentleman and respect her. In case if she doesn't want a relationship, she will let you know of it then and there.|`|48xxYQsaaa	just say whatever come to mind.  u shouldn't go looking for things to say like that, those kinds of things should be from you..and only you.|`|luhOd3cAaa	hello  it's not a script or dance to practice , go out with her to some lonly place or ask her where does she like to be more . and see for the right time dont talk any filmy diaulog just tell what comes to u r mouth .   see that  the atmosphere is lovly because it makes much difference in our langauge.
2hhGgKBZaa	Theres 2 ways you could go in my opinion. You either need to even the playing field and make a bit of fun of him around your mates (just doing the same as he does to you and see if he likes it!).    Or another approach would be to tell him he's not funny and distance yourself from him. Not physically, as you said you have a lot of common friends, just dont talk to him and ignore him.     Even if he makes comments just go "huh, was someone speaking?" etc. You need to show this guy who's boss!!|`|hci2me2kaa	say something in front of everyone- like you don't make yourself look big when you make others look small
W1aYIF71aa	Hmmm.... You need to tell us, in detail, what your fantasies are.  Also, you should describe what you and your friend(s) look like.|`|4HoVVCenaa	You aren't crazy. Fantasizing is common regardless of ones leanings. But it would be abnormal to pursue ones fantasies inappropriately, i.e. where they are not wanted or encouraged.
AQ3QqA5daa	maybe she having a bad morning or bad mood day and wanted to chill.    I wouldn't read too much into it and see what happens tomo to see if there's a pattern or does she go back to normal?
39e9235b89c9b80c32eb4b4082db80ccaa	when we were playing scrabble, and she left to make a cup of tea, I quickly spelled it out on the board.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	We were both in the military and I had just gotten back after being away for a month.  We were dropping my bags off and I had gone inside the building while he waited in the car.  When I got back to the car there was the ring sitting on my seat.  I was like what is this.  He apparently got tongue tied because he didn't say anything.  I said if this was a proposal you had to ask.  ;-)  So he said 'Will you mary me?'.  I asked if he was sure...yes, really romantic.  Then I said yes and we kissed for a while.  We were married two weeks later and have been married for 6 1/2 years.|`|BlVudiyfaa	I put it on the scoreboard at Titans Stadium. Unfortunately, we weren't there because someone slammed into our car as we were waiting to exit the InterState to go to the game. They turned out to have numerous warrants so the cops had to come and make an arrest. Then they searched my car and found my brothers lab equipment because he is a research biologist at the local University. The cops became very nervous and thought we made meth. So they had to contact my brother to ask him about the equipment. He of course told the exact same story that I told but then asked the Cop if I had popped the question. The Cop did not know but then asked me about some question. I was completely floored as I had forgotten all about the scoreboard deal. When my fiancee heard the cop ask me she screamed which upset the K-9 dog who jumped up on her and slammed her to the pavement, knocking out her front tooth.|`|CVdcrY3kaa	Well, I didn't propose, but here is our story.    My husband was stationed in CA (Marines) and I was still in IN. I in to visit him for the 4th of July weekend. He took me to San Diego and we went to a little, fancy Italian restaurant. I thought he was going to propose, because he had been very nervous and he kept talking about marriage in the weeks prior. Anyway. He left to use the restroom, which took him around 15 minutes..turns out he was practicing how he was going to do it. He came back, and asked the waiter if he could take a picture of us. As soon as the waiter held up the camera he got down on one knee and proposed - so we got it all on film. It was very sweet.|`|6hBKoN6Jaa	I'm still waiting for him ...|`|ipWRgKetaa	We lived in the Washington DC area. I took her out to a very nice dinner and then suggested we drive downtown. Washington DC and the monuments are really beautiful at night. I really didn't know where I was going. We didn't really have a special place, but I found a place in front of the capital to park. We got out, I pulled a cooler out of the trunk and suggested we have a drink in front of the capital. There's a statue there, just at the foot of the capital steps. I set the cooler down, pulled out a bottle of Dom and two glasses and asked her to marry me. Laughing here. She didn't seem terribly surprised. We'd talked about it often and I think she just figured it was inevitable. Still, it was nice. And that was about 23 years ago. I still have the bottle.|`|RKhSRMlZaa	We planned this trip together and I was completely unaware of his intention.  Well, he picked me up at the airport and we went to Catalina island off the coast of Southern California.  When we got there he couldn't wait any longer and as we were settling into our hotel room, he said "I brought you a present" and pulls out the ring box.  It was very sweet.  I was completely surprised but said yes right away!|`|ITfBQzg6aa	Im still waiting for my boyfriend to propose to me..
84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	The three main colors not to wear are: White, Black, and Red.  White -- You don't want to upstage the bride. People will think you are rude and disrespectful.  Black -- That is normally for funerals. When you wear black, people will see that as your "mourning".   Red -- Upstages the bride.  Jeans or shorts, t-shirts -- Even if the wedding is casual, it is still better not to wear jeans, shorts, or t-shirts.  Anything too sexy or revealing -- You don't want to take eyes off the bride and groom.  Anything torn, with holes, stained, too big or too small for you -- That just looks tacky.  Anything sleeveless or strapless to a religious wedding-- Bring a wrap to cover your shoulders.  Big hats -- It's rude to wear big hats, because the people behind you cannot see well.|`|AA10975867	A fancy white dress. Anything that's waaay too casual like loose cargo pants or skanky skintight jeans or shorts or t-shirts. Anything that is waaay too sexy or see-through or low enough to nurse a baby or short enough to almost show your bottom.|`|JbRTKDFmaa	Jeans and sneakers|`|EsaFg8eaaa	Anything a Stipper or a hobo would wear is what I would guess|`|AA11152434	Jeans! or white dress and dont upstage the bride.|`|B8Nz2KzXaa	A dress that looks like the dress of the bride..    -R|`|1BGwGFQZaa	All Black!|`|HKQ7wBtdaa	shorts|`|JRlIB8Ttaa	white, or anything to outthere|`|8cj6zRtsaa	any thing low cut, or short short, or "hookerish" lol.  i'd avoid wearing all white dresses too. The only one who should be wearing white is the bride.|`|B5SaueYtaa	Black, white and red are the 3 colours wedding guests shouldn't wear according to etiquette. Black is a colour of mourning, the bride wears white, red upstages the bride.  You also shouldn't wear neon colours but thats pretty obvious.|`|18ea4ff1fbd8faac2adc309bdd4c7b45aa	All black  All white - or even mostly white.  Something too revealing  Something too "immature"   Something that doesn't fit well, is dirty or stained.  Something too casual (no holy jeans or pajama bottoms)  Something disrespectful (tee-shirt)  Great big hat - especially indoors|`|NVrLg3Bjaa	All black, white, jeans, t-shirt (unless its very informal)|`|lILfQh6xaa	white dress.|`|YNdKlKpdaa	Wearing white is the biggest faux par  "A major breach of etiquette"|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	If you know the wedding colors, don't wear them.  I wasn't too happy when several of my guests showed up looking almost like my bridesmaids!  It was very annoying.  Also don't wear alot of white, because most likely that's what the bride will be wearing.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	black is fine, it's the most formal color God made.  white is taboo though, it steals focus from the bride.  also don't wear anything too tight short or revealing, that's gauche.|`|47af2fda89839c0ec02e273cff59d82daa	women shouldnt wear white dresses, cept for the bride.    and anything too short is usually a no no, same with anything that shows too much cleavage|`|Z0GfGZtJaa	Do not wear the same color as the bridesmaids.

y9IHHrYXaa	Now then young lady. What's all this nonsense about needing sorting out. Did my twin sister not slap you around properly - she's getting soft. When the wounded soldiers were admitted we would give them a good slapping and a good shagging - went out different people.    Now, sort yourself out - she's only been gone a few weeks and you're in a mess already - and I WARN YOU NOW if I have to come and do it, I will not spare using the cane!    I could of course look after you properly if you see what I mean muuuuaaahhhh     edit  My dear, I have had more buzz than my twin ever had fuzz and like her I don't mind if it's duff or muff - and if you think she could give you a good seeing to then just you wait for me.    edit  I've just read one of HoJ's old letters and it's obvious she was very lenient to you all - poor dear is still stuck in Thailand helping police with their enquiries.   Mark my words young madam, if you take me on a train ride, you may not come back in one piece when I've had my way with you !    Courtney sweetie, cast your eyes on these boob jug melons - now, when d'you wanna play dearie?  http://i282.photobucket.com/albums/kk265...|`|WT9cjXtIaa	Its seems that she knows how to let the children have fun, and pull them back in when they go too far. HOJ commands respect when she enters the room, and everyone there knows to behave or deal with her.     Now it is odd that she never mentioned having a sister, so who this Hattie above me really is will be in question until we hear from the girl herself. Until such time I think they need to buzz off...|`|RluCMVUSaa	I can feel the sanity returning we have a Hattie back!!! *does happy pole dance* yeah!!    Yes we do need someone to police our cummings and goings, ins and outs and all other motions!    New Hattie: can you do reverse tassel spins? (this will show rather or not they are related!)    Hattie: How I have missed you! I am ready to play!  I hope she told you that I am a student at the house of love... can we custard and feather you for old times sake?... please?    Ted: I really missed your night terrors, they led to increased sleep sex|`|ba4R1tf1aa	Is that really Hattie's twin sister?    My gard, I'm so confused...    Blue pills, please, Maggie...    A couple black plastic garbage bags full of them?|`|rPywKtJRaa	Yes Maggie I dare say you may be right.  When things get out of control HoJ just took us by our nips and whipped us in shape....literally!  I am defiantly out of control and deserve a good spanking.  See look at the avatar she's already in position.    Maggie this Hattie is definatly going for a ride!|`|6U9b2t4raa	This is wonderful..  my therapy was just starting to take effect.  My night sweats and screams just recently went away.. ( besides the fun ones Courtney makes me do)        Now it's gonna start all over again... welcome back Hattie..should I assume the position?

If she wants something she should be having her lawyer ask for it.  But on that note she maybe thinking that, that cost money so she is asking for it instead.  She should not need a copy of his drivers license unless she is trying to do something a little shady.  As for the insurance-it depends on if you are talking health or car.  If she is asking for health and he carries it for their child, this might be why she is asking.  If it is for car she is up to something shady.  She does not need this at all.  Hope this helps.|`|bgkqOx2yaa	I do not believe that he should provide should provide the driver license number that is personal information and if she needs it for something the child needs then he should go and present the information himself. I think she will not let him rest because she is hurt and the only way to get at him is thru his child. ***Mildred IS MY LEADER***|`|tsBL19qzaa	She doesn't need that information.

But be careful, you may find that it represents a part of your life that wish to forget someday.|`|3892ff0d005ca0e7cc3e0bb1045ba012aa	I have three. All three are very feminine and had a lot of thought put into them before I got them. I would love my boyfriend to get one but he doesn't want one but on me thinks they are very sexy. I have one on my lower back which is a celtic heart in my favorite color and with paisleys all around it. I just got a butterfly on my bikini line and I have my children's names tattooed on the side of my right ankle. I wanted to make sure I loved them before I got them since once they are there they can't be removed without a lot of hassle. I did have a boyfriend one time that told me he'd love me more if I would have the one on my lower back removed. I said no if he couldn't love me for who I was then he didn't love me at all. Go figure we are no longer together. I just got the other two within the last month. It is everyones personal opinion on how they view tattoos. As I tell people "they aren't on you so you don't have to look at them. They are an expression of me."|`|ev33OxJbaa	Tattoos are nasty looking no matter how the art work is.  When you get to be 70, they will look really nasty.|`|pwejv6jpaa	depends what they are, and where they are. especially on a woman|`|0Id85yiYaa	depends on what they are. a cool design that has meaning behind it is sexy, but a tweety bird that says "bob" isn't.|`|AA11796667	I have a few as long as they are girly and pretty they are OK   But I didn't get mines to be sexy, I got them as a personal choice because I like them tattoes are not for everybody.|`|BlVudiyfaa	repulsive|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I don't really think they are sexy, but I have a couple and I like them.  My husband doesn't and that's fine too.|`|8CTosi9saa	tattoo's can be sexy, but I'm not a fan of tramp stamps, and some girls get them way too young.|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	It depends.  Too many is not sexy, but gross.  A few strategically placed ones are fine.  My husband has 3 and I have 2.  I love his, and he loves mine.    Mine are placed where you will only see them if I want you too.  BTW, I don't consider lower back tattoos "trampstamps".  True, some girls that have them fit that definition, but not all.  It's just another place to get a tattoo. If you must give a name to that particular placement of a tattoo, why don't you call it a "bumper sticker" instead?  EDIT:  I just LOVE when people start saying, "If we were supposed to have marks on our body, we would have been born with them."  Guess what?  I'm willing to bet that these people see nothing wrong with pierced ears.  If we were supposed to have holes in our ears, we would have been born with them, right?|`|0hR5hMquaa	Tattoos can be very sexy depending on their location and as long as they are not too many. Maybe 1 or 2. Of course it also depends on the person...I know a few people who do not like tattoos at all. In my opinion a couple in sexy area are very sexy. yours are in good areas. I believe for a female the small of her back, the hip, the back of the shoulder and sometimes the ankle if its a small dainty tatoo. For a male I belive that oround the arm is sexy and on the upper back between the shoulder blades.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	On guys...they're sexy.    On girls....they're cheap.    And the more she has, the cheaper she looks.     Double standard, but true.     Good Luck!|`|8txWayVnaa	I just got my first tatt about 5 months ago.  It's really small, and on my right shoulder blade.  I think it's really sexy because it's understated . . . you know--less is more?    I want to get one more. . .a tramp stamp.

All that matters is that I like them.|`|szAj0WMmaa	How does your husband feel about them?      And last time I checked, its not the tat that makes you sexy...|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	It really depends on the design and how it looks on the body. My woman as 2 small ones and 1 big one.

50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	First, I am so sorry for your loss.  Second, thank you for being the wife of a soldier and I thank him as well for the sacrifice he made.  I have always heard to wait at least a year out of respect for the memory of the deceased, but when you are ready, you are ready.  You will always love your first husband, there is no way around that, and it is great that your new guy understands and respects that.  I think enough time has passed that it is "acceptable" to remarry if that is what you want to do.  Good luck sweetie.|`|u1uECuFNaa	Now.  You feel ready.   Make sure you tell his family first...as a sign of respect.  :)  And make sure they know he is always a part of your life.  I think you are ready.  Good luck.|`|X2EPEEwbaa	Only you can decide when you are ready.|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	i am so sorry for your loss. there is no set amount of time - it's whenever you are ready and feel mentally prepared to do so. good luck and i wish you lots of happiness :)|`|KM8uZ4fVaa	I've heard the standard is a year, but it's really up to you, when you feel you've paid enough respect to his memory. That's a really tough answer to give.|`|FIG58FVpaa	The first answer here: "Whenever You feel ready to." is absolutely correct.    Nobody else can tell you what is right/wrong/okay/acceptable. Only you know how you feel and if you're ready or not. Marrying someone else doesn't mean that you love your first husband any less, just that you've accepted that he's gone and you're ready to move on.    Good luck!|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	I am sorry for your loss.    I am glad for you that you found someone new.      You can remarry now, it's been 1 1/2 years.  It used to be that the 'proper'  mourning period was about a year.  I am not even sure that applies anymore, anyway (and it was a societal rule/guideline).    Good Luck.|`|GmTMVmASaa	i think you've waited long enough, but for the most part as for how society veiws it, it's usually a year. you will always have love for your soldier, and it's a shame he was taken so young. but you have to keep going and live your life, so you must remember that life is too short too waste. if you truely love this new man, then you marry him and procceed to have a wonderful life together.|`|QSodlfMraa	whenever you feel the time is right honey.|`|f58ec99bd12e60acd134f41c8821665baa	I'm so sorry for you losing your soldier.(Thanks for him fighting for our freedom).    If you feel in your heart that you are ready for this,go for it.May you be happy and beable to love again.|`|AA11706291	Whenever You feel ready to.|`|CRhS02q8aa	Your heart is free to do what it feels it needs to do.  Your soldier will understand.  He would want you to be happy and to be taken care of.  You deserve to live a happy life.  There is nothing wrong with moving forward.|`|ucCNBrVyaa	First of all never forget your first husband. honor him always.

0VqNMJQFaa	Thus far ? Let's see.. I broke into his house, left trails of candy through his house that led to various presents (with letters attached explaining what trail to follow next) that eventually led him to a letter telling him to go up to this historic landmark across town that he'd been wanting to see for a while.. then, he would follow a trail of post-it notes I'd put out to another letter: a card that read, "I wished and wished.." then on the inside, it said, "and you came true." At the bottom, I told him to turn around, and when he did, I was standing behind him (I had been hiding in the bushes, waiting). After, we went back to my place, where ten of his closest friends, his favorite cake, and lots of snacks were waiting as a surprise party. =] I was rather proud of myself.|`|bJGD7o5baa	Our relationship started about a month before her birthday and I couldn't think of anything to get her. We really hadn't kissed yet so I tried to incorporate that into it. I ended up listening to a bunch of songs and taking words I thought I could use and wrote them down. After I had a decent amount I made a song and the chorus was about "sharing a kiss in the moment." After I typed that out on the computer I printed it out with a nice border and since I'm alright at drawing I drew a rose on the cover and shaded it. I gave it to her when we were alone and then we kissed really passionately after that. It was awesome and she loved it because I definstely put some thought in it.
NBAce2AHaa	good .. for me at least    fast .. so i dont think it was great for her ..|`|g6tku4aVaa	idk|`|BBlfetz3aa	great if it is passionate. still quick though. she got nothing out of it, lol.|`|2OpYUFMuaa	Don't do it unless your over 18 or you will be called a ****|`|41NyT8oPaa	Fun , passionate, excited, just great, i was ready and i was doing it with the guy i love so much, that was 6 years ago and i'm still doing it with him, and he still rocks my world.

But seriously, if this is basically a one off - give it a few days and it should all die down.

ltUzwXZEaa	Your english is just fine. As far as the parents it is never easy to choose between the two so what you should do is explain to your dad that you are not really choosing it is just that you feel like mom needs a little more support because of her condition and he can deal with a little more than she can.Tell him that you love them both the same mom just is not as strong as he is that is all.I am not sure how to make them both happy but I think that you should tell just how you feel about the fighting.hat way they know that you are not happy.|`|u7Y1SAViaa	I think maybe your mother wants you and your dad to have a man to man conversation, just to make you comfortable. it maybe that they want a divorce, which i would highly recommend if they both fight a lot. They want to tell you in a way you won't get upset.
eFXD3Qzcaa	I don't even know what that is, sorry.
JiUwpYSXaa	What if he feels the same as you do? want's to ask but is afraid you will reject him. Wait a couple months stay good friends, then at some point say "__________" you know I like you and could we go to the ________ sometime.|`|noX4xlvKaa	Well if he's told you he doesn't like you then that's that you cant force him to go out with you. Stay friends don't risk your friendship for something that could be broken in a week!!!
KPXwwwMMaa	Whenever you tell someone how you really feel, you take a big risk. Ultimately, a good guy will respect you for your honesty, but it will change the relationship.    You might graduate to being closer than just 'friends', or you may get rejected. A good guy will respect your straightforward opinion the most. If he doesn't respond well, then he's really not someone you want to be in a relationship with, anyway.|`|aO5uVFwIaa	That's a tricky situation, because you either win, or you fall hard! Before you tell him you have a crush on him, ask him if he has a crush on you, if so, you can then procede to tell him that you like him too! Also include that you dont want to ruin your friendship by trying to be more then friends! Hope this helps!
VsamHLPOaa	I'm not sure this has never happened to me. Seems like these girls are pretty flaky, you should be glad that they blocked you.|`|dBkEqT2naa	It means that they think thzt you're clingy and creepy. You are only best friends only if that relationship status is agreed by both parties.
IKXZZDH9aa	It depends on the rules of evidence in your state. What could happen, and likely so, the statements would have to be formal depositions in order to be admitted into evidence.    What the court is going to want to know is who has spent the most time caring for and raising the child. In this case, that would seem to be Dad. he is only obligated to follow the order, and as long as he does that, he's not doing anything wrong as the court found that the order they rendered was in the best interest of the child.    Unless there are substantial and continuing changes in circumstances by those affected by the order, it probably won't be modified.    Honestly, the ONLY issue I see with him that you could use is that he does not foster the relationship with you and the child, which he is obligated to do.    I don't see you having much to go on right now, and unless you offer more information, with what you've given you're likely not going to win.|`|YuVSDBkzaa	You can use written statements (character witnesses, etc) but they have to be given to the other party in advance and turned into court for them to review as well. Why would he have main custody of her in the first place, considering it's already difficult for a man to get primary or sole custody of his child? Either you agreed to this arrangement in the beginning or you did something wrong?|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	The courts usually base residential custody on which parent is more likely to support a relationship with the other parent.    If you can prove that he will not allow you to speak to your child on the phone and that he has stated that he doesn't want you to have any contact with her, you will show that he is not working toward a co-paretning relationship.    You should also have a proposal to show that if the child lived with you, that you will be encouraging open communication and generous visitation/access.    Good luck!|`|Vhq3GURQaa	See if you can get the statements notarized. Shows that you didn't write them. Bring some of the photos of your activities. If she is enrolled in any church activities, bring that. The more you can show that you are stable and have a good home and social life, the better. Make sure the court knows understands that you do not know her whereabouts. Good luck hon. To the above. Your last comment is not true anymore. Judges are not giving children to mothers as they once did. I know of a few situations like this. In fact, one of the first men in the US to get custody, was a friend. It was an awful, expensive drawn out affair but he finally won.
GEOamw3paa	That's not normal behavior and you should definitely break things off before it leads to physical abuse.  He's messed up in the head.  Especially since he lied to you about it and continued to send the messages even after he saw how upset it was making you.

INSIDE THE MINDS of ANGRY and CONTROLLING MEN  BY: LUNDY BANCROFT    15 Signs That Point to a Potential Abuser    1. A push for quick involvement: comes on very strong, claiming, Ive never felt loved like this by anyone. An abuser pressures the woman for an exclusive commitment almost immediately.    2. Jealousy: excessively possessive, calls you constantly or visits unexpectedly, prevents you from going to work because you might meet someone, checks the mileage on your car.    3. Controlling: interrogates you intensely (especially if youre late), about whom you talked to, and where you were, keeps all the money, insists that you ask permission to go anywhere or do anything.    4. Unrealistic expectations: expects you to be the perfect woman and meet his every need.    5. Isolation: tries to cut you off from family and friends; accuses people who are your supporters of causing trouble; the abuser may take away your phone or car and try to prevent you from keeping a job.    6. Blames others for problems and mistakes; the boss, you  its always someone elses fault if anything goes wrong.    7. Makes everyone else responsible for his feelings: the abusers says, You make me angry, instead of I am angry or You hurt me by not listening or doing what I tell you to do, also, Why do you make me hit you?    8. Hypersensitivity: he is easily insulted, claims that his feelings are hurt when he is really just mad.    9. Cruelty to children and animals; kills or punishes animals brutally. May expect children to do things far beyond their ability. For example: may whip a 2 year old for wetting a diaper, or may tease a child till they cry. 65% of abusers who beat their partner will also abuse children.    10. Playful use of force during sex; he enjoys throwing you down or holding you against your will during sex; says he finds the idea of rape exciting.    11. Verbal abuse: constantly picking at you, or says cruel, hateful things, degrades, curses, calls you ugly things, then says youre too sensitive. May include sleep deprivation  waking you to curse at you, wont let you sleep until this is taken care of.    12. Rigid sex rules: expects you to serve, obey and remain at home.    13. Sudden mood swings  switches from sweetly loving to explosively violent in a matter of minutes.    14. Admits to hitting women in the past, but says they made him do it, or it wasnt his fault. Uses threats of violence. Ill break your neck! Ill kill you if then says Everybody talks that way, or I didnt really mean it. If he has come this far its time to get help to get out.      The Abusers Most Common Control Tactics:    ? Sarcasm  ? Ridicule  ? Distorting what you say  ? Distorting what happened before  ? Sulking  ? Accusing you of doing what HE does, or thinking the way HE thinks  ? Interrupting  ? Not listening, refusing to respond  ? Laughing out loud at your opinion  ? Turning your complaints against you  ? Changing the subject to HIS complaints  ? Criticism that is harsh, undeserved or frequent  ? Provoking guilt  ? Making HIMSELF the victim  ? Smirking, rolling his eyes, making faces  ? Yelling, shouting  ? Swearing  ? Name-calling, insulting you or putting you down  ? Walking out  ? Towering over you  ? Walking toward you with his fist raised  ? Blocking a doorway  ? Getting too close when he is angry  ? Threatening to leave you  ? Threatening to harm you    How Can I Tell If A Man I Am Seeing Will Become Abusive?    ? He speaks badly about his former partners.  ? He is disrespectful towards you.  ? He does favors for you that you dont want or puts on a show of generosity that makes you uncomfortable  ? He is controlling  ? He is possessive  ? Nothing is ever his fault  ? He is self-centered  ? He abuses drugs and/or alcohol  ? He pressures you for sex  ? He gets serious too quickly about the relationship  ? He intimidates you when he is angry  ? He has double standards  ? He has negative attitudes about women  ? He treats you differently around other people  ? He appears to be attracted to vulnerability  ? You show signs of being abused    Is What He Doing Abuse?    ? He gets you back if you complain about his behavior  ? He tells you that your complaints about his treatment of you are your problem  ? He gives apologies that are insincere or angry and demands that you accept them  ? He blames you for his behavior  ? Its never the right time, or the right way to bring things up  ? He undermines your life  ? He denied what he did  ? Anything he does that is hurtful or angry was because You made him do it  ? He touches you in anger or puts you in fear  ? He pushes you for sex or sexually assaults you  ? His behavior is a pattern    REMEMBER!    Abuse comes from attitudes and values, not feelings.    Abuse and respect are opposites.

0ulKsvXlaa	You HAVE to contact someone in authority.  Go immediately to a Hospital, to Child services or to the Police.  If you can talk to your mother, TELL HER IMMEDIATELY, then go with her to the police.  DO NOT tell your step father what you are doing.    Very Important.  Your Step-father is a Paedophlie rapist.    Do NOT be worried about what problems this causes HIM    HE has not thought about what problems HE has caused YOU.    You will be looked after, very well, you need have no worries about that.    Please... don't be afraid to say the truth about him.   In many years you will understand why I tell you this.  What he has done to you could come back and affect you over and over again in your life.  You will need help, believe me, and the people in authority are the people that can provide that help.  Now go, directly.|`|0Z4tqTIMaa	CALL THE POLICE!!!! NOW!!! ASAP!!! don't be afraid to. what he is doing is completely wrong!!!! you will be safe so don't worry!|`|BlVudiyfaa	contact Children's services. They are in the book.|`|XwtZIenKaa	its rape!!!!!!!!!!!!!!CALL THE POLICE!  iTS OKAY|`|cHt8QPh2aa	hun you really need to stand up for yourself and call the police before you end up getting pregnant with your own dads baby...its not right what he is doing for you! see if you can live with a friend or something. cause a girl should not be put through something like this!! get help now..I'm serious!!|`|hBDwpwvKaa	you can tell your mom, if she do not want to believe you. you can tell your school teacher or call the police. what he is doing to you is very wrong.
Z3pQ0Teuaa	Life is way too short to worry about things like that. Find friends who don't gossip about you and don't let anything anyone ever says about you get you down :)    I would just go right to her and ask her why she told your friend those things. If Bryan was truly your best friend, he wont care about losing his friendship to a girl who talks about you.|`|O2pReCYMaa	First of all you should find out for sure if your friend actually said these things before you confront her.  Secondly, perhaps Bryan likes you and doesn't know how to express himself except in the negative. By this I mean if he wants to get next to you and believes your friend is in the way, he might think that if you believe she is not your friend you will turn to him for comfort and consolation.  Thirdly if it were me I would get them together and find out what's really going on.|`|3JgLRElnaa	stick sumthing up her *** ..beat da hoe up for gossion bout u lik dat|`|m81dfyOYaa	I agree with LB, most people are very uncomfortable when they have to listen to derogatory gossip about a friend or any one for that matter.  I always have the feeling that if someone is talking badly about another person, they'd have no qualms about trashing me. Phase Nicole out of your life, don't confront her, just ignore her.|`|nBMVi9t8aa	CURSE HER/HIS *** OUT!!!Sorry im so angry im really mad right now|`|RjpGomsyaa	If she is behaving like this I wouldn't call her a friend so say goodbye to her|`|TYetEnJ5aa	Go solo for a while, let her know you don't need her. Prove her wrong on what she said.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	Get new friends|`|KnGJ12cqaa	let her run her mouth. believe it or not, people don't respect, or trust, someone that does that, for those very reasons. so let her do it, she'll find out.|`|hneetSf2aa	Well sounds to me like she probably has a crush on bryan and so she telling him made up crap about you...she's not your friend if she's doing that...i would confront her..you dont have to say who told you..that just isent right|`|2ONtnHbJaa	yes, confront her. you don't have to tell her who told you. just say someone told you about what she has been saying about you. tell her if she was a true friend she wouldn't talk about you behind her back.|`|aH0yYcTIaa	everybody gossips about people when they are gone|`|L1g6ZnkXaa	tell her you overheard a conversation or just tell her that someone told you but you wont say names...|`|LWvh2g2maa	Stop being her friend.  Just tell her that gossiping isn't what real friends do to other friends and you don't waste your time with immature, backstabbing, two-faced b*tches.|`|hJLcqWKXaa	just say that you heard some kids talking about her saying something about you and you say why are you doing this  haha  it has happened to me, me and my bff stopped hanging out and then she said to me that i was noothing because she was like "Prom queen" i punched her hehe  yeah...  well do what you feel

jswDLpJzaa	I think, in America anyway, we are so used to instant gratification that we aren't willing to (or even care to) put in the time to try to work things out. Personally I think it's pathetic. I am even experiencing problems in my own marriage, my husband, anytime hes depressed, or unhappy with ANYTHING,  says I am the reason he's miserable & wants a divorce. Maybe it's the lack of respect for the actual "sanctity of marriage" itself. or lack of respect for your mate, not enough religion, or it's just too easy to divorce. Why bother getting married if you aren't at least willing to try to make things work... but hey, I'm jaded.|`|KwNpyp3saa	This hasn't always been the case. As women have become more independent and no longer need to depend on their husbands, they no longer tolerate such behavior- like abuse.     It may appear middle class women are treated as princess. This can be just a facade. It's easier to cover up things when you can buy your way out of "trouble". By this I mean abuse or being unfaithful. Sometimes these women don't want to rock the boat and lose the life style in which they have become accustom.|`|SgOVFseaaa	Treated as princesses?  *gag*    I'd rather be treated as an equal.    I have no problem with Muslims or people from the middle east, by the way.  I'm married to a Christian African and my previous boyfriend was a Muslim Morrocan.  It's all good.  If you want some rich guy who's going to treat you like a pet cat, then marry that.  If you want to stay in an unhappy marriage, do that.  If you need to get a divorce, then do it and be well.    Who cares?|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	We have high divorce rates because of women's rights.  In western countries, beating your wife is unacceptable.  So is the idea that women cannot be seen in public without a male escort, etc.    Westerners accept that treating women as property is wrong.  We accept that a consequence of that stance might be that women will no longer tolerate domestic abuse.      Your observations hold correct for women in most countries.  Those who are treated well have happy marriages. Those who are abused get divorces.  The difference is that in the west, we ALLOW, SUPPORT and ENCOURAGE abused women (and men!) to free themselves of abusive partners.    Pedophilia has nothing to do with divorce.  Not sure how you made that connection.|`|BlVudiyfaa	public schools
PBdPD748aa	just thought id say a little something about my experience... since i am not sure where you are located!!    Well me... im in australia (sydney) and i am going to elope with my fiance in tropical north queensland (still in australia). We both dont get on with our parents much at all, his family have been cut out of our lives and i am not close with mine at all, and we both figured that we cant pick and choose and it is the best way to do it, to share our most special day becoming husband and wife with each other, and each other only.     we even tried to work out a celebration with family and friends when we get back - oh my gosh worst mistake we ever did - bringing these people back into our lives - they never changed even years later - so thats now certainly off the agenda! i think you are marrying to become each others family and there is no better way to spend your special day then with each other - especially if others have brought your hurt or pain.     come to australia - its warm and beautiful and romantic down here :) we are getting married in a rainforest by a waterfall together :) make sure you do get professional photos though - that is one way you are going to remember and look back on your day forever. and i am certainly still wearing a stunning wedding dress with a train and all - after all its for my fiance and i am not compromising on anything just because we dont have others there.     picking and choosing wont work - trust me, been there, done that, couldnt even hold a celebration cos of it. be confident in the fact that he will be your husband and you two will start your own family. be strong and good luck!!!|`|N37Udp4Iaa	I'm going to get married abroad or possibly the UK but I wont be taking any relatives along for the ride who I havent see for years this way I can treat the people who matter most to me.|`|02b6c889232eb78a02e56ab8d5831bb5aa	We're going to Mexico, but aren't eloping as we've invited our families& friends. We live in UK and have never been on an exotic holiday and found that marrying abroad was cheaper than marrying in UK and we get a gorgeous venue and great honeymoon thrown in lol.    Think about what types of things you and your fiance are looking for- culture, wildlife, hot/cold?, relaxing leisure, white sand? etc...
lgxE5nUoaa	It could be one of several reasons or a combo: 1) he might not believe in marriage and since you are willing to live with him, he doesn't need to ask. 2) Some guys do not like the expense of marriage or of having to buy an engagement ring.  3)  Maybe he's not be the committed type. The very thought of marriage could conjure ball and chain images.  Or 4) and this is the worst one,  he doesn't think you're the one and is merely waiting for the right woman to come along - until then, he'll take what he can get.|`|zDeFibxzaa	tell him your going to move out and that its been bothering you to be like this ,maybe it will open him up and make him understand?in his eyes he has you and doesnt need to get married.some women like it that way,so they can run when they want to,but you seem like not that type.just tell him you thinking of getting your own place and its been bothering you that you have been staying together without proper vows.that should hit him in the face and wake his a'''s up|`|aDIPIu7xaa	Stop playing the wife role until you actually are a wife.    That might speed things up!|`|50b371e8637dae2470606af52c269bacaa	I can tell you why it took my husband 5 years to propose, but whether this applies to your bf, only you know.  We lived together for several years and had talked about marriage several times.  We had both been married before, so he was in no hurry.  He told me that he wanted to be 100% sure that marriage was what he wanted, and that he had to be ready to take that step again.  He was a little scared too that I would change after we married, like his ex wife did.  The good thing about us being together so long before we got married (a total of 6 1/2 years) is that we knew each other really well, and there were no surprises.  We knew what we were getting.    The only one who really knows why your bf hasn't proposed is him, and if you want to know why, you need to ask him.  Tell him to quit talking about it and just do it.  It may be that he's saving for a ring or a really romantic way to propse.  I can tell you from experience that when it does come, it is going to be even more special because it took so long.  Good luck!|`|rcut6bhoaa	Now wait a minute here,  why is it that the GUY has to propose.  I know its traditional thing to some, but why is everything left up to the man?    YOU propose to him and you'll get your answer. Then continue on , the same night, with setting a date for the wedding.    One thing that peeves me here is women want a 50/50 relationship but when it comes time for them to step up to the plate, they wont!|`|VSVQHKwKaa	You both live together. You're undoubtedly sleeping with him. You probably handle the inside upkeep and he takes care of the outside stuff.    Why would he risk half his income and assets? What's to be gained for him?    You're already performing all the wifely duties. Why risk making it legal? Why pay for an expensive ceremony? Why go through the embarrassment of a divorce (because divorces are so easy these days)? Why do any of it?!    It doesn't make any sense! It's not practical!    Sorry, but you sold the chance to be married to him away for free. You're already ACTING like his wife. He's not going to risk anything further for a marriage license you can frame.     Good Luck!|`|MkBWfaJlaa	when you get the milk for free why buy the cow|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	why should he marry you?  You're playing house and acting like a wife without him needing to commit. Move out.|`|7d65453e3d628e90746acdacb5c61c16aa	he's getting all the benefits of having a wife without really having a wife. why would he? you probably need to give him an ultimatum, if it bothers you that much......|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	Most men prefer "blunt and to the point" type of conversations. It removes any guess work and everyone knows exactly where they stand.    Tell him that you need to talk, that you have expectations and that you want to know where you both stand in the relationship. Do not be afraid to be blunt. As I said,most guys appreciate it.|`|asxqampCaa	The only thing marriage does at this point, since you agreed to live with him, is endanger half his material wealth.    Why buy the whole ice cream truck when you are giving away the popsicles for free?|`|JkvlAVX2aa	The question for yourself is....Why keep the whole pig when all you get is a little sausage???    Kidding aside, there are many possibilities on why he has not proposed.  As a guy, I can give you a list....and the list could go on and on and on.....and on.      To name a few:  He likes the way it is now and he does not want to risk changing it.  He is afraid of commitment.  He is looking for a horse while riding a dunkey (no pun intended).  He has no money for the cost of a wedding.  He has never thought about it.  He is waiting for you to "push" him a little.  He is waiting for you to make your move.  He just doesn't know "why".  He does not know how to or afraid to end it with you.    Instead of wondering about "why" yourself, why don't you just ask him???|`|PRUXtYh5aa	Most likely answer:  you are his fall back girl.  If he doesn't find someone better (in his mind) he'll marry you.  He just isn't admitting it to himself or you.  He is waiting to see if someone else comes along.  Could be that he loves you but isn't really "in love with" you, but he is too much of a wimp to face his feelings.  This describes my brother and his now ex-wife perfectly.  She chased him around for years (literally around the country) until she finally got him.  He always saw her as just a friend, but one day let things happen. Getting to be about 30 he decided well, nobody else has come along and I do "love" this girl so why not marry her?  So they got married and I was disappointed and concerned but never said anything except to my wife.  Low and behold they divorced within two years. He wasn't sexually or romantically attracted to her, but tried to be (she isn't all that attractive physically/personality and really isn't the type he has always gone for).  He lied to himself and it blew up, fortunately before they had children.  Now he is recovering from a terrible marriage and she re-married immediately and got pregnant, what she really wanted anyway.|`|6KpZ2fIRaa	As long as you are together and happy, it should not really matter if/when he proposes.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	He's afraid|`|ldqQDwI4aa	Why don't you propose?|`|f21c4568248ded0eeab01a76d3a81476aa	He's getting some without having to pop the question, so as long as you let him play you he will.  So what you need to do is tell him you're moving out if he doesn't ask you to marry him, and mean it.  Either he will do it or he won't and let you walk, in which case is ok, because he didn't really want to marry you anyway.      Just be straight with him.|`|y9CgveCGaa	What will he gain by marriage?  You are already doing everything a wife does without any commitment from him?|`|4Pe8yZnuaa	I agree with the others.  Why should he?  He has the best of both worlds.  You're "playing" the wife with no real commitment.    If this arrangement is not suitable for the long term, you will eventually have to give him an ultimatum, which would be: marry me or I'm moving out.

AwAw0uiKaa	Your friend needs to just be outright mean then. She may not want to hurt the girl's feelings but she has to if she is ever going to get the issue resolved. Technically, it could be considered harassment, I guess... but anyway, your friend needs to just tell her to stop it without dropping "hints." Hints don't work.     Depending on their ages, maybe she could ask her parents to talk to the stalker girl's parents??|`|26Auv91iaa	have your friend ***** about it to you in front of that girl|`|V9mROi7waa	she may have to be blunt and tell her to back off and give her time to breathe! or just ignore her completely.|`|o298GAKcaa	well i think she needs to sit their with the girl and say can you please stop follwing me because you sometimes have to be mean to be nice its not even being nasty its just letting her no that she dnt feel comfortable being followed all the time .|`|JERUmEFzaa	I hate people like that! There so annoying and don`t forget to mention them being clingy and ushering away your friends! Well your friend should tell this girl straight up that she does not want to hang out with the crazy stalker girl. She doesn`t have to care if she is mean because she wants some breathing room!     Tell her goodluck!|`|AbCeEZIhaa	Well remember this, what your friend is doing to her once-friend today, she can be doing to you tomorrow so I would not take too much of this upon yourself to fix. I think that it is very sad, and I think your friend needs to either tell her and be honest, say I just need some space or maybe learn how to have more than one friend at a time.|`|szvL591iaa	tell your bf to the stalker to back off or file an restraining order.|`|64zQydobaa	This girl is probably just lonely.  She does need a friend.  Invite her to a social event where she can meet lots of people her age and hang out.  She will probably find other friends to lean on.
OI3bf4yjaa	I lost my virginity when I was 18. Fourteen is TOO young to be having sex. Jeesh you're probably still going through puberty.|`|GrwWH5XJaa	Tomorrow|`|mimykKnhaa	I was 15, and too young to appreciate and enjoy it.    It takes a level of maturity you won't have until you are older to fully enjoy it. Believe me, my perspective on it has changed a lot over the years. Plus, an older partner will know what he is doing much more than a 14 year old boy... not that you should go find a grown man!!!|`|utGddhnVaa	16..I knew lost of girls who lost it at 14 tho..|`|2esGKO2Caa	13 and i have no regrets and believe me that was a long long time ago!|`|nMkDpEQJaa	.: I was 18 :.    .: 14 is a bit young, you should wait :.|`|jBxW6ee9aa	I have not lost my virginity and I am 18. The reason people make a big deal about losing it so young is because your virginity is the one thing you can't get back. And most believe your virginity is meant for your husband. That's a special gift you give up, so it's meant for a special person. But if you have no regrets, then be happy.

My only fear for you is that if this guy breaks your heart or things go completely negative, you're going to regret this. The problem i see is that you're looking at the length of your relationship to determine if it was time. If you were really ready you would not be questioning yourself at the current moment. In all, it already happened and you've just gained a new experience...and with this newly acquired experience, you must question yourself as to what is next?|`|WbsDI2lSaa	i was 19.. the first time sucked.. the second time was quick.. the 3rd time.. ohh yea... it was good..|`|Ll6lxxQJaa	Right now baby. ;)|`|ihaCEikwaa	If you feel that you were ready than you were ready!

I was 17 when I lost my virginity to my first and only love, who I am marrying in April =)|`|8VbRqBSOaa	I lost my virginity at 17.    There is nothing wrong with losing your virginity at 14 persay, though in my opinion it is a little too young.   Not because you aren't smart enough or competant, I am sure you are! But at 14 you simply haven't experienced enough, havn't gotten out of those awkward highschool years, havn't gained enough confidence and can't really have the maturity needed to understand fully the implications of having sex.    There is nothing wrong with you, do not worry. But as you can see, you may not have been ready yet. If you do feel badly about it, there is nothing wrong about telling your boyfriend you want to wait to have sex again. Just because youve had sex once doesn't mean the each time after isn't special.     Make sure you do what makes YOU feel comfortable and don't let his expectations of having more sex make you feel guilty.|`|oqh9KThCaa	still havent im 18   14 is young but i guess if u save it for some one u really love or care about its ok but be safe dont do oit all the tie and get pregnant and if u break up dont be a hoe a sleep with everyone.  partners add up when u start young and ppl will lose respect 4 u|`|yTYLayLtaa	i was 18    i don't want to sound like you dad or something but i feel that you shouldn't have done it. odds are your not going to be with him forever like you may feel like you are. also he is probably going to tell his friends and by next week everyone will know it happened.And the final thing to think about before having sex is are you ready to have a baby that is what sex is at its root its for procreation. condoms break and birth control pills may not work. im not going to say you made a mistake but just think about what i said im not even writing this to get the best answer i just want you too read this and learn something so that you don't make a mistake and ruin your life or have a baby|`|D24Npt4eaa	As long as you feel love for the other person and comfortable, it doesn't matter how old either of you are.

It's not that you will be smarter or something, but you'll just have a different view of things.  I am nothing now like I was when I was 14.  I have changed a bunch.  Some of the things/decisions I made at 14 I will never do now.      Anyways, as long as you don't have any regrets that is fine.  Don't let anyone judge you.  Just make sure to use protection.  Be safe and have fun!!|`|n2fniR4Gaa	definently!!!! ...................................NOT!!  jk losing your virginity is a VERY weird and scary thing 2 do. i havnt but i know it will be. my sister lost her virginity at that age and she is already taking college classes in the 10th grade. sex is something all people want and do.it does not reflect your personality.|`|3pHfLU1Waa	i was 18|`|bm1rsts7aa	I haven't lost mine yet.

17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	Personally, I really don't think there is any rush for him to make such a huge commitment and convert to Islam. You're both so young! There isn't any need for him to convert. Why don't you both just enjoy being around each otherr and have fun?! That's what teenagers are supposed to be doing...enjoying youth! Why do you want to grow up so fast? It's not all a big laugh, let me tell you.     As you are both serious about each other, then why not just tell your parents you are seeing him and introduce them. It doesn't matter about anyone outside of your family, they are just people who have their own irrational judgements. It should not impinge on your happiness.   Just enjoy being together and spending time around one another.

When you eventually start to date again you will know what to avoid.|`|3ctchU2faa	First, thank your mom for letting you move back in with her and your baby. Tell her how you much you love her and appreciate her in your life during this stressful time.  As for your husband, I suggest not contacting him until he gets his act together. If he sends money for child support ( I have a bad feeling he won't ) make sure it goes into a bank account for any health emergencies that might occur.  For the money problems, start with a part time job, and work your way up. Times are going to be stressful, but remember you have a mother who loves you no matter what, a little bundle of joy who sees the sun rise and set on you, and a heart that knows it deserves better. Give it time and patience, things will get better eventually.|`|BopBYwSdaa	you have to be strong for your baby becuase you are a responsible mom.    if he goes to thrillville for a free ride and don't sent money for his baby...then file a child support lawsuit.  he lost job and wanna go to dreamville maybe he thought he had enough of being a good decent guy and wanna be childish about it. I don't think you have that luxury.    mom and dauther 50% not get along but I'm sure she love you same as you love your baby... maybe when she's adult, she will think the same way with her mom but I'm sure it won't make you love her less.    file for bankruptcy, go back to school, and be a single mom ... you can do it... you are not alone (so many of my friends lost job or their husband lost job)    things can't be any worst (you cover all bad arrow checklist already) ... and like I always say when we are at the bottom already (hell), you can ONLY LOOK UP (heaven)    keep your hopes up...that what will keep you going|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	ive never been there, but it sounds like he put you through hell. in the short term, even if you feel like you are going through a really tough time, you will come out of it, and you will be a better person for it.     you are doing a good thing for you and your daughter. it is better that she have no father around than that she grow up thinking that fighting, yelling, whatever, is normal for a relationship.    good luck, chickie! :)|`|AA10722993	Sorry you are in this situation.

DON'T go by word of mouth promises he makes.    You'll want to talk to an attorney about 1) A Disso (I would strongly suggest one) and 2) Filing a BK. (you want to see if it would really be helpful of if it would hinder your situation)    You may not get along great with your mom, but she's being there for you when you really need her.  Try to get along, help around the house, and generally try to appreciate anything/everything she's doing to help (even if it's little to nothing).  I think you'll find that if you're positive and helpful at her house, it will be better for everyone there.    Be strong and be prepared to have a FULL plate:  You'll have a child to care for, homework to do, and likely a job to help pay bills.  >DO NOT    Please, whatever you do: 1) Don't go crawling back to the loser, and 2) Be more selective in future mates.  Don't be afraid to date someone a long time.  If a guy is serious about you, he won't be in a rush to get you in bed.  If he's just a player or loser, he'll move on for easier game and you won't be 0 for 2 in the marriage game.    Good luck.|`|5Qo6OWNzaa	File for divorce so you can at least get custody settled.

R5Dl17Draa	I agree! There *are* teenagers who may not really understand love, but not all of them are that way. How can an adult say what a teenager can and can't feel? Love is possible at any age. Besides, there are some fifteen-year-olds who are a lot more mature than some twenty-year-olds.|`|C6d4ndMOaa	it's called experience, something that older people have.|`|U0KiOYQOaa	because in order to REALLY love one has to have already had their heart broken to understand.   one that is wise and has gone threw this process really knows the meaning of LOVE.   when your young you have these intense feelings that could be love but in order to know what to do with it, how to handle it and how to appreciate it you have to have already been there.    with love comes so many emotions and half of them are not good emotions but hurt, scared, vonruable. etc    you can be infatuated with someone or have baby love and in fact this is what gets us to the point of knowing what true love is. not just because they are sooo hot and gives you butterfly's but gives you what you need emotionally, makes you whole, a life partner etc.     every time your heart brakes it gets stronger and wiser.     a young person cant possibly imagine what true love is unless you know what lifes hard ships are and been threw the ringer with your heart.|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	Because young people count things like hours and days and consider a week a long time  Adults count in years|`|MiF8lq9oaa	Teenagers are usually more impulsive.

GeruGGOQaa	Not marriage but in a relationship the best part is sex on a consistent basis, someone to share paying the bills, someone to share in the housework, someone to share in the cooking, someone to share in the parenting, someone to share our day with, sorry ladies I could blow a bunch of smoke up your skirt but I'm trying to give you ladies an honest answer.

This works great until a woman interrupts the silence.    If you wonder what is on his mind, ask him and he will tell you. If he says nothing it actually is nothing. I know you won't understand nothing because it has a completely different meaning to women. In female lingo, nothing can mean anything from something to everything, but rarely means nothing.|`|IAXxvp44aa	for me its not feed me , sex , feed me.   its does she "want"  me?

Someone to be around, the company, all guys also want to know they are needed or "Wanted".  Sex is very important though, it lets us know our wife needs or wants us and it relieves stress for men or at least me.

So if your a man and want a family and take responsibility, why shouldn't the sex be the icing on the cake.    When I grew up in high school I studied and worked, the girls banged the football player, when I went to college, guess what, same thing.  Now I make a good living and they are all druged up fucked up and have kids to a bundh of boys that don't take responsibilty for their actions.  Now they all want a man like me and for it to have more meaning than just sex.    Now what is it that you  expect out of the man that took responsibility to work his *** off for you and your family for the rest of his life no matter what, that he act like he don't like or want sex except when it suits you?

caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I haven't even gotten married yet and I had bridesmaids telling me what dresses they refuse to wear (which made dress selection impossible until I had to go bridezilla on them and put my foot down about the length, fabric & color dresses I wanted them to wear, then I had to deal with them idividually to pick different dresses and the first two I handled chose the same dress and tried to force me to force my sister - the other BM - to wear the same dress as them).  My FMIL accused me of forbidding her from buying the dress she wants to wear to the wedding and I had both of my FSIL's on my case that I can't treat their mother that way (FMIL asked what color dress I would like her to wear, I discussed with my fiance & we agreed that we would ask our Moms to not choose any red because there is so much red in our wedding party.  I didn't know it, but she had been eyeing up a burgundy dress all along).  Another relative told me I had better have an open bar or else he would lead the guests to take back their gifts & leave.  One of my FSIL's told me I ought to have the wedding in the state where my fiance & I are from when we now live in another state 2-3 hours drive away because it would inconvenience the family to have to drive to where we live.  We could afford a wedding in our home state, couldn't afford to live there either which is why we moved!  My Fiance's nephew almost took down a chandelier at our engagement party because his parents weren't watching him.

Bring an umbrella, you never know!|`|GvamTVqAaa	A hurricane hit our town and destroyed everything.  We had to cancel the wedding we planned for 9 months and plan one in a week where we were evacuated.  then we had to drive 8 hours to catch our plane to our honeymoon.    But in the end it was amazing and I married the love of my life :)|`|YuYSL0A2aa	When I got married.... I was getting married at a chapel 35 minutes from my house. My two bridesmaids were meeting at my parents house so nobody would get lost going there since they hadn't been to the wedding site. Well one of my bridesmaids got to there like an hour & half before we had to leave, so she decides to run out and get a bite to eat.. okay no big deal she's going like 5 minutes away....boy was I wrong. She got back like 10 minutes after I wanted to leave and then in my rush I missed one of my bags of items to take. Unfortunately we were already at the chapel getting dressed when I realized it. The bag I forgot had my shoes,bra and hair piece in it... Fortunately I was wearing ballet slippers and my wedding dress had a lace up back.   Then during the wedding the pastor mispronounced my name which was really odd since I had known him all of my life! I don't think anybody caught it - at least nobody said anything about it! lol     Unfortunately there is always more drama than you planned, you just have to roll with and not get upset. Remember it's your wedding not theirs and they don't have to approve of the way you want it. Later you will look back on it and laugh. I picked one picture of us coming out of the chapel just because you can see my bare toes if you know to look. :)
88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	We'd considered the 63rd Street Beach House--great setting for a wedding.  We looked at it in early spring.  I went back in early summer to look again, and was horrified at the number of sea gulls swarming the place.  With the courtyards being open, I don't know how you'd control them during the reception.  That's probably going to be a problem anywhere along the beach, though.    A beautiful indoor venue that feels like "somewhere else" is the Garfield Park Conservatory (it can book up to 14 months ahead).  Try some of the smaller museum and art galleries.  Buildings, like The Rookery and the Wrigley Building will rent out their lobbies.  For outdoor places, we looked at other Chicago Park District venues, Glessner House museum (they have a pretty outdoor courtyard in the middle of the historic mansion on Prairie Avenue), the Botanic Gardens (beautiful, but very pricey and very far north) and some venues with the Will County, Lake County and Grundy County forest preserves (all too far from where we wanted to be, but some nice options).    We settled on Brookfield Zoo.  The ceremony was in an outdoor pavilion, cocktails and hors d'eouvres at the giraffe house, and the reception in a banquet room that had a balcony overlooking the zoo.  Weddings are done after hours so there aren't strangers in your pics or crashing your reception.  We got some great pictures, and had a very fun, unusual and elegant wedding.
Zu7GJeU4aa	BE A KID you are only a child once, forget about boys especialy 13 year old ones lol|`|f3n2zXG2aa	I can tell you that at your age that is normal to feel this way.  And don't worry about guys start liking someone else weekly at that age.  It is hormones over reacting to everything, and they do not stay focused on one relationship at this age.  Knowing this is normal behavior will help you a lot.  One of the most important things to know right now is that you are normal for feeling like this.    One thing to do is pray for Jesus guidance in times like this, and he will lead you to what you should do.    You do not need anyone to tell you how awesome and pretty you are, you are one of God's children.  Have confidence in that.    Read the Bible, it will lift you up tremendously.  Look up the word confidence in the Bible.|`|2nkCO7HLaa	I hope you feel better Hun!!! :(  If you need anyone to talk to I'm always here!!!!

Umm, you are only 13 and guys are jerks right now anyway, so its good your not with one yet because they're all stupid and immature = ) You are better on your own and needing to find better friends that you can talk to when your upset. Finding people online to talk to isn't the greatest because you dont actually know them. Your friend/sister that dont seem to care when your upset probably just feels uncomfortable with helping others with their problems and doesn't know what to do. Tell her you need comforting and if she still doesnt try to help, is there someone in your family that you can talk to more? Maybe a cousin thats your age, or maybe try to make new friends at school!

This is the time of your life where you are supposed to have fun with your friends and not worry about guys. Guys will come up sooner or later, but for now, you should just accept yourself for who you are and have fun instead of being lonely. Your turn will come,just like everyone elses. The guy moved on from you , which means you should move on also. The right guy will come along for you. He's waiting for you,just like you're waiting for him. Things will start to recover and become better as you keep getting older. The guy that moved on definitley missed out, but there are so many others out there for you. You'll know when you find the one, you really will. For now, go out and have fun,live your life upp! By the time your 15 you'll look back and realize how better off you were moving on and having fun instead of being lonely all the time. Hey, maybe by then mr. right will have come along :) Mine came along when i was almost 15 and we've been together for a year February the 10th.:) Everything will be okay girly :)    good luck!|`|1NvTeGp4aa	Alright, Sophie... it really breaks my heart reading you like this. Look, I've never done this before... but here, this is my MSN address:    andarilhodossonhos@gmail.com    I'd like you to add me as a friend of yours. Don't worry, I'm 26 and I'm not a... that thing you said about the other guy (I'm not gonna' say it, 'cause in my language that word means "fart"), that is, I'm not into kids.    I'd really like to talk to you... maybe we can be friends.    If you decide not to add me, it's ok, I'll understand whatever reasons you may have had. In this case, I just want to say: don't dwell in those feelings, dear. You're young and you need to know that feelings like these will come and go in our lives. They're challenges to us as persons. Be strong, I know you can beat this.|`|Pz0Np7JLaa	Sweetheart, you're 13. that's the age. And if it doesn't hit at 13, it will hit at 14, or 15 and 16 for the late bloomers. But i remember feeling so lonely and depressed and unloved. I remember feeling like a worthless piece of you-know-what because guys didn't have an interest in me the way that they did other girls. And i wasn't fat, or ugly, not that weight or appearance should have anything to do with it. But darling you need to see the wonderful attributes that you have. Make a list of all the wonderful things about you, and forget the cons, because one thing that attracts both friends and boyfriends, is self confidence. I was shy honestly until my senior year of high school. It was really tough getting by, and i never really spoke in class that much. It made me feel like there was something wrong with me. Why the hell couldn't i socialize and speak in class like a normal person? But once you find yourself, and realize what makes you happy, and the type of people that make you happy (Which will come in age i promise) You will open up as the person you became through age.|`|FHu7pHhRaa	aww I know what you feel like!  okay start by thinking that things could be worse?  but for now I would focus on getting like friends who aren't guys for now - you'll have plenty of time for that in the future!  Try dramatically updating your look, and it might give you that extra boost of confidence which could make all the difference. If your best friend doesn't care if you're upset then tbh I think you should try and get a new one! Get your friends closer to you, but if they are already in like 'set' friends groups then try something which will enable you to get more friends - take up something new! You could go to some sort of youth club maybe and then you would meet loads of people your own age! Or you could throw a huge party for all of your friends and even people you don't know that well - a disco or sleepover or something, then you can get people to like you more!    also, for the unloved thing, try spending more time with your family - going out on trips and stuff, or going to the theatre, even going for a family walk! Even if your sister is much younger than you she can still make you feel better, and make you feel loved. I'm sure things will be okay - don't worry!  x|`|8mcs564laa	Don't worry about it, you're only thirteen. Just remember to always be yourself because that's when you'll know a guy likes you for who you are. Don't take the whole situation too seriously and there are going to be a ton of other guys in the future. Just enjoy being young and try not to think about it as much.Also it might not be that your friend doesn't care when you're upset, she just doesn't know why. If it's really bothering you, it might help to talk to her about it. Everyone has there bad days every once in a while and goes into a funk, but just remember that you are young and still have a lot of fun and things to look forward to and that these feelings you have right now will eventually pass and something great will happen. Feel better! =D|`|Yd7kM30naa	I'm 15 and basically in the same situation as you.  If you want someone to talk to let me know! I'd love to make a new friend!

w3oVzM2Zaa	i am so sorry.That is disgusting.You got to tell your family how you feel.Im sorry but he is not a good hearted guy.He is sick.You have got to tell him what he did maade you sick.Seriously stay away from him as much as possible.What he did was beyond wrong.it is a very big deal.Dont let a/o convince you otherwise.You have got to have a confrontation with him.I feel so mad for you.Please be cAreful.You cannot trust him at all.Talk to ur family.This wont go away.It will eat at you.Stand up for yourself! im wishing you all the best please let me know what  happens if you can,Im scared for you.|`|4f8fdRbpaa	You really need to get professional help. Your family should of been there for you, It unbelievable that they did not do nothing about it. It should of been dealt with then and your life would be much better now. You can not let this go, you need to seek professional help and they will guide you in the right direction. If you dont this will haunt you the rest of your life. You say your father is a good dad, HOW, could you possibly be a good father if he molested you. That is insane. He would have been sent to jail for doing that. Maybe you should also talk to your family and ask why they just let it go, because it keeps coming back to haunt you. Ask them if it had happened to them what do they think they woiuld have done in your situation. No father should ever put there hands on as a sexual desire......that is no humane,,,,,,,He should be locked up,You are putting other people at risk for him to molest.   How would you feel finding out about the next victim....Is this what you would want for some one else out there. They usually are repeated offenders......Dont ever think that he is normal..........Save the other people out there. Do you know for sure he hasnt done this to other girls, for one if he did it to his own daughter what would stop him from doing it from other girls out there.... I feel so sorry for you to have to go through that, just get the help you need and they will guide through this. This way you will not be alone...........|`|Vp83Fuakaa	after 10 years this still bothers you and it always will unless you get some help you need to talk to someone that's not your family may be a counselor .it was not your fault and your family should of helped more and confronted you dad|`|AA10199189	okay, girl, you need to talk to a neutral third party.    your dad probably thought it was a hoot!  sort of - look what i can do, eh? your dad can shoot a fountain!    well, there have been a lot of problems that have recently come to light, involving abuse of children, but this is not abuse.  you have been overly sensitized to a situation that - when it does happen, causes major trauma to the abused person.    and so you should get help in getting the proper perspective on this event.    if he were an abuser, he would not have done that and then nothing, ever again.    as for the comment about your breasts getting bigger, he's your dad, you are his child, and he is talking about your development.    as for forgiving, your dad is the one that is the wronged person here.  you misunderstood something and because of societal BS you essentially painted him a colour he does not deserve.
agTCqkLDaa	My mom read an article several years ago that said put your spouse first.  (Yes, even above the children, because you two are what glue the family together).  He is trying to be there; they are NOT trying-he has no reason to feel guilty though I understand why he does.    He needs to put you first and at 14.50/hour, it's going to be really difficult for you to stay home if he's trying to support four children.  Not to mention, like you said, they are adults.  They need to climb out of Daddy's wallet and get a job unless they are in school (for which I assume he is paying), but it never killed anyone to work AND go to school.      If she expects presents then she needs to make an effort.  She sounds like a spoiled brat personally.    My dad had 5 children from a previous marriage and one in college when I was little or right before I was born.  They kept in touch with him, but they tried to pull the whole pity thing and he told it to them straight up "I love you, but she is my wife.  Now, I have no problem helping you out, but you are adults."      You don't want to exacerbate spoiled brat syndrome.  It is damaging to all parties involved.    His kids need to grow up.    My siblings are all between 18-30 years older than me and despite what people believe, we still consider them our siblings, but dads need to know their place.  I'm sure they got child support right?  If the divorce was recently (like during their adulthood) then their dad was around financially when they were little and the child he has with you needs to be treated as such.      My brother P. (who is the epitome of what a man should be) came around much more after his divorce.  He's now been married (his second marriage) for several years.    My sister A. came around too because she was the eldest and a total daddy's girl.    My other sister, L. is b**** and anybody will tell you that.  Sometimes, I think I've inherited my nasty attitude from her.  I"m working hard to expel that =-\   A. died this past summer and looooved my father (who passed away in 1990).  L. delivered the eulogy and not once did she mention my father because she STILL has spoiled brat syndrome.  (Oh, did I mention she's in her fifties??)    My sister J. is the one who was in college.  She feels bad for not being around so much and I think she has good intentions but we never really get together.  I don't know if she's all there.  She was the youngest when my dad and her mother got divorced.  Her mom was abusive and an alcoholic.  It's kind of caused her to have some problems.    My brother T. is an alcoholic/drug addict/bad seed.  It's really sad.  Our father was a doctor and once they got into a fight because my dad didn't have a business for T. to go into because he was too lazy to go to school and/or start his own business.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	They are grown adults! And asking for specifics from parents at that age seems silly, unless they are asked what they want as gifts. Sending money to a son who is 29 years old every week?! What?! I can see how you would be upset. Honestly I don't know what I would do in your situation but I really feel for you and hope you guys can work something out.|`|6fPfKfLVaa	Silence is not the solution here.  You two don't have a lot of money and with the economy the way it is, you shouldn't have to burden yourself even more.  You need to let him know that you support him in wanting to be involved with his kids (try not to make what he is doing sound negative because that will make defensive).  Yes, you know that his kids are using him but guess what, HE KNOWS IT TOO.  He is just trying to reach out to them even thought they are being selfish (guilty conscience?)   But you should let him know that even though you support him, there are bills to pay & that you should be saving money for a rainy day.  Try to make a budget with him on how much should be spent on all of the kids (including the 8 month old).  If that still doesn't work, then you need to just save whatever money you can.  You love him & don't want to hurt him - and so you just have to let it go sometimes.  I know its hard, believe me - husbands can be so stubborn.  Hopefully you guys will be able to make do & those selfish kids of his will grow up.|`|u7f0QB37aa	Take control of his finances|`|CCFhjtNBaa	Leave it be. But know this, they are using your husband. It sounds to me their father wasn't there for them growing up and it seems to have built loads of resentment towards him (which is understandable) But your husband buying them things isn't gonna make his kids like him again. It's just going to make them smug that he's buying them gifts and they aren't feeling anything towards him in return. What he needs to do is stop buying them stuff and be firm with them and see then if they want a relationship.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	He is there Father, Unless he asks you for Help just stay out of it|`|f3n2zXG2aa	If the child you have now were in the same situation, you would be worrying about how much your child could get out of him too so ??????????????????????????????????????|`|bO2rzfISaa	Yes, they're manipulating him because he feels guilty. Their relationship with him really isn't any of your business unless it's affecting your finances. If that's the case, you need to put together a budget without mentioning his kids.  Put in a category for gifts.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	if they are all adults, i wouldn't give them a dime. if they want something they can get off the butts and get a job. smack him in the head. he's not helping them at all by giving them money, only enabling them. i know bring up stuff about other peoples kids is a hard think. i have gotten a divorce over that before. my wife's kid wanted a race car but had to use her car to get back and forth from work. i told him he needs to buy a car for himself first and then get a race car if there is any money left. i really don't know how to deal with it. if you were working and part of your money was going to them i would be very very upset. why should your hard working dollar go towards the lazy people. i know the money he is spending on his kids, could be used for your guying stuff for your daughter and other things. tell him his kids are not children they are adults that can get jobs. sure he feels bad about the relationship he has with his kid, but sending them money isn't going to fix it. you are in a tough spot. i would talk to him and give him a time line to tell his kids that he can no longer afford to buy them expensive things, and give them money. if when the 6 mos. is up nothing has changed, i would consider a divorce. it's time he started looking at your feelings and  using the money spent on his kids for your daughter, and HIS daughter.|`|GmTMVmASaa	those children of his are adults, and they should have jobs and providing for themselves. birhtdays and christmas, are money giving times, and your husband should know that.|`|dF7pM10kaa	I would bring it up to him if the finances are effecting providing your baby with the best life you can. If his kids are getting significantly more than your baby I suggest mentioning that to him, since his children are adults and yours is not.|`|ByUS0k8waa	ok well he is probably just making up for not being there and the fact they may feel like he went off and started a new family. I don't really see the problem with giving them things here and there. By the way $14.50 a hour is great pay for the way job are right now. You should feel lucky that he has a job and that you don't have to work.     I don't care how old my child gets she can always come to me and I will always spoil her. I think if its a problem then you should talk to him and if he doesn't want to talk about it throw him into couples therapy. Also you could say that the children must come to him for the $ or they will get nothing that way you guys get to see the children. He knows what they are doing but feels so much guilt for whatever he doesn't care. Also you cant expect him to forget about the other children just because he has a baby with you!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Tell him to stop.  Regardless of whether he was or wasn't there for them in the past, he cannot buy them now.  And he isn't teaching them anything good.  This is basically extortion.    But if he isn't listening to you, he isn't listening to you.  Don't make this a problem in your marriage.  See if he will go to counseling with you and get on the same page about money.  It's one of the leading causes of divorce and so are children from a previous marriage.
M0KvAKe2aa	Exactly how does he/she touch you? if it is the chest area, or below the abdomen then you should conider moving out if you don't feel safe, or you should sit down and talk to them and give them a warnig like if it happens again your going to move out. if it's anything beyond that get out of there as fast as possible and call the police if they try to assault you.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Put a lock on your door or move out.|`|4fikqmnUaa	Just tell someone, obviously.

I went trough something like that with my step daugther, but in this case, the little girl would visit her mother because we have custody of her, and she would tell her mother anything to get her mother of her back anything to stop her mother from bothering her and it stopped when I confront her and told her that is not the way she would have to be honest and make sure she told truth no lies. But with this girl she is old enough and the difference is that she knows what she is doing, is best to stay away from her and consult your husband he can confront her better telling her that if the visits with him and your family are unpleasant for her that she can simply stay home with her mother and not come with her siblings for the visits she sounds old enough to make choices, so she can choose to stay her *** home. He has to be very strong and tell her he will not tolerate her acting this way any longer.Honestly I feel for what your going trough. But be patience and make sure you let her know that you are completely aware of what she is doing.. Hope things get better for you Good luck.|`|rx0ekB9Paa	u have to be the grown up here and by hiding from her is dumb. u have to just deal with it. she might be lying cuz she feels guilty for having fun with you. i dont know. my step mother is horrible and lies on me to my dad.|`|AA11080047	well you and your husband need to sit down and work out a formula. why your husband hasn't done nothing after going to prison loosing is job over hes ex wife. now he daughter  seems to be a chip of the old block. myself i would confront her and tell her all your feelings about her with your husbands approval because i feel your marriage will suffer if things aren't checked. myself i wouldn't have her in the house.|`|ef5765ccb36f7ad11f5b37081f153824aa	(First of all, Cravin, can it with the pathetic, unhelpful two word answers so you can be a top contributor. She's looking for help here)    Alright.....well.....it sounds like you are being a very big person about this and I gotta commend you for  taking the time to try and connect with his kids. For the most part, I believe you're really doing all that you can. There's not really a whole lot you can do about the things his ex-wife is saying to the kids when you're not around. It's really sad that she can't be a big enough person and have enough sense not to talk about you and the kids' father around them. Some parents think kids don't pick up all that bitterness, but they're just like sponges....they soak up everything. I don't think it's wrong that you don't want to be around them when they come over, but I do think you should just continue doing what you're doing and treat them just as though they're your own. You can't dwell on what may or may not be said about you when they go home. All you can do is be the best person and parent you can be. I know that sucks, but you just can't change that kind of stuff. I'm sure your husband has tried talking to his ex-wife about it, but from what you've said, it sounds like she's probably not very open to rational grown-up discussions like that. I'm not really sure what legal action you could pursue in a situation like that either, but you're probably limited on that as well.    I'm sorry I can't give you better advice then that. For now, teenagers will be teenagers. Just keep loving on the kids. It will pay off in the long run.|`|V9mROi7waa	Confront her and tell her that you have ways of knowing what she says about you. Tell her that you and her mother talk.

I have never heard a good story. What you need to understand is, the mother could be making up things. She could be telling you the step daughter said certain things about you and she didn't. Or the daughter could be trying to please her mother by talking bad about you. What you need to do is have your husband tell his daughter if she does not like you and is going to make up lies about you she does not have to visit. If I were you, I would leave for the weekend when she comes to visit. And if she wants to know why, tell her straight up. Don't be afraid of children. She needs to respect you. Don't kiss her ***, she should be kissing yours. She is a child.|`|OT3eczxaaa	You're not wrong to feel frustrated. Teenagers are difficult even in the happiest of homes. My mom used to joke about how got mouthy the day I turned 13. I would suggest family counseling at this point - including their mom if she would agree to it (though it sounds like she won't).    She's testing her limits. I know it's hard, but it's going to require extraordinary patience on your end.    Good luck to all of you!|`|m8QfHC7uaa	She must be the thirteen yr old....WOW; I've lived this. I have no real answer to this; Except, take what she says as a grain of salt....dont get angry, dont react, dont fuel her in anyway....love her as you will, treat her with the "respect" due for lires.  Believe me this may go on for years. She is angry and needs to seek help to deal with "her" feelings. You and your husband, and other kids seem fine.  Fine a good counslor for her...she will find a way back to accepting the life that "is", and be more happy. She is worth every effort you and your husband have to give. NEVER GIVE UP ON HER!
f02e697306fa9b0bd6517818970ff8daaa	If you wake her up at 5:30, see if she can last the whole day without napping. May not work.  We have an 13 month girl.  We just turn out all the lights at 10pm and go to bed.  She cries for about 10 mins. when she realizes that nothing will change. she comes to bed with us. in about 10 mins, she is asleep in my arms. after another 15 mins, she is good enough that i can put her in her crib. That works for us. by the way i am the dad.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Ever heard of a spanking?    Look, it doesn't matter if she goes to sleep or not. Next time she gets out of bed, warn her that getting out of bed again will get her a spanking.     And if she does it again, SPANK HER!!    Then tell her she is getting another if she gets up again.    I promise she'll go to bed.     Good Luck!|`|9ZwFQadRaa	Put her in bed, and let her stay awake. Don't give in, no matter how much she cries. If you give in, she'll learn that all she has to do is cry and she'll get what she wants. As far as alone time, it is very important. If you can't be alone because of work schedules, it's time to schedule a day off from work. Missing pay sucks, but so does the alternative.

a7364bce10f3534559a9e7a19fe16bcbaa	That's a question for the individual resorts that would host your wedding. Many of them have special packages, so call and get quotes.     If you invite people to the wedding, you have to pay for their reception meal ... but you are not obligated to pay for their plane tickets or hotel accommodations.     But remember, a destination wedding usually means a LOT more money for your guests than it would if you were getting married in your hometown. Destination weddings often have a higher decline rate because many people just can't afford the travel fees or the vacation time. But it's up to them. If you're OK with possibly having a small guest list, go for it. If you really want certain people there, or a lot of family/friends who you aren't super-close to (immediate family and best friends will likely attend if they can, but extended family and not-so-close friends might not), I would run it by them before you make definite plans.
IdNRyzXlaa	Perfect. Im In the 5th grade and my lasy bf was a jerk. Anyway, if he at all looks straight at you in the eyes (No matter if u see him looking out of the corner of your eye or wut) that means he likes u. I mean he is looking at u!!! Also, watch his lips as he talks to friends. If you can read his lips say ur name- he can talk about u. U've got him. Well, its young love- witch isnt hard.     First, start with the simple talking. Then, if he says anything about being jealous where ur mom works or anywhere that you always go- or even where u live- simply say- "hey, i'll take u next time i get the chance. As a friend. U know." Then it doesnt sound weird. After a few "friend dates" then ask if he wants to hang at ur house. Do that. Hang at school. And all. That will will make him more into who u r.       Dont do all this in one week or anything. Then it will be going WAY too fast. And, if it turns out he doesnt like u and he's ur friend- dont sweat it. There are plenty boys out there. Also, be careful. My last bf, Jordan, has changed my feelings about boys. And, like i said, if it just so happens that he isnt into u- well, hey- have fun instead of worrying with friends, and have fun checking out boys. With a bf- they may get mad if ur checking others. SO live life, and have fun. With a bf or with bfF's. Hehehe. Hope i helped. Peace.....|`|1eh7GMM2aa	UR IN FOURTH GRADE! you dont know naything at that age, sorry to say chick. just stay single for awhile. trust me, when you're older, you'll wish you had.|`|sbfJ3ma6aa	Depends on how he's acting. Usually in the 4th grade guys are just talk and they just wont you to say they have you and not because they like you but he could. If he acts different than he used to its a sign if he smiles around you thats a hint and just look for simple flirty things like that.
by7H31Djaa	I know what you mean. When my husband bought his PS3 it was ok he never used it all the time. Then he bought a game and became addicted. He was on all the time BUT it didn't always bother me. It only bothered me because i couldn't really talk to him and he would still play it even though i was running around the house trying to get our 15 month old and myself ready to leave! He traded that one in for Bad Company Battlefield and he was addicted to that one too. It's been hmmm over 4 months that he's had this one and just about 1-2 months ago he's let go of it more. I think he plays more when he's here with our son and im in school. I don't mind that he plays it at night when i rather be online when our son is sleeping already. Oh by the way he's 22 Lol    EDIT: I prefer that he play games on his PS3 than online because not only am i online more but being online on a computer is more dangerous if you know what i mean... ;o)|`|HOK5C8n4aa	My ex-husband used to play ffxi.  Then I started playing with him, turned out I was better at it than he was.  It did give us something to do together, but there was more wrong in our marriage than playing a game together could fix.      It helped me cope with the divorce until I was ready for the whole real life thing.  Get him tickets to a game or a concert he wants to go to, if you get him out doing things he enjoys, he might see that the real world has a lot of fun things too.  Then the game mght become less an addiction and more a thing of recreation.|`|GmTMVmASaa	omg! mine does too, and sometimes it bothers me but most times it doesn't. he's 31, and better to play video games than to be out doing things i will not appeciate. sometimes we play together, and so this makes us both gamers. i especially enjoy playing the sims on the ps 2, so if you can't beat him join him. the wii is also alot of fun, but then so is this here q&a site. know what i mean?|`|48e54c6394da5ea92d90b07084568dcfaa	My husband not at all, but I do. I play foot ball in both, 360 and ps2, fi fa09 and winning eleven..Im in tournaments all the time, not online thou, I enjoy it and it`s great way to stress out. The thing is I don`t displace him..or ignore him, but when hi`s in some unlikeable or unsympathetic mood I rather to play with my little men..|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	My husband doesn't, but I do, I play WoW, and it's the only video game I have ever played. My husband doesn't get mad, as he has plenty to do while I play the game. And yeah, it does work out to be about 4-5 hours a night, although it sure doesn't feel like it. I'm 34, btw.|`|u7f0QB37aa	No i don't i out grew that about the age of 16|`|0BC2WTyoaa	My husband is 30 and if I allowed it I'm sure he would play it often.  I tell him that he is a part of this family and needs to contribute more than a paycheck.  That usually straightens him out quickly.   We have a Wii but he only plays it about once a month or so which is completely acceptable.  He would sit and watch TV 24-7 if I allowed it though.  Drives me nuts.  ;)    I also do not allow my kids to play Monday through Thursday.  If they do their chores and homework all week they earn weekend time with the DS and Wii.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Married 20 years - 3 kids - very kind wife.  COD is a great game.  But from one man to another I would not ignore my wife to play day after day unless she were ignoring me in ways that I found equally frustrating.  A kind and loving wife who takes care of her husbands needs is usually able to address this kind of stuff very directly.  But if he has any issues with you, good luck because it isn't going to happen.|`|IvMPh09baa	yep, he is 31 years old and plays xbox soccer all the time.  He always asks me to stay next to him and watch him play and I just get up and leave the room.  Its either me or the video game... usually I just go to bed when he starts to play.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	yes.  id says he's 24, acts 14    thoroughly annoys me.  dont' see how he can play for so long--he'll go all day & night...|`|SiniSj1eaa	I bought my guy an xbox 360 for christmas..so he plays it. Not that often though. Couple times a week for a couple hours. Hes 25 and still skateboards/snowboards non stop..so thats where all his time goes. I bought the xbox cuz hes had surgery on his leg three times already and im trying to get him to calm down a bit before we have children haha.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	So he Works his Butt off all day and relaxes by Playing a game and your Mad about that|`|GvamTVqAaa	No he doesn't.  Every once in a while we'll play the Wii together.  That's about it.  I'm thankful he's not into video games.    I'm 26 and he's 28|`|dwLqreuvaa	Yes we both do, its a hobby of ours. Call of duty is a fun game too :)    You should talk to him about it, if its really getting in the way of things then you need to talk|`|uvWuVWb1aa	We're both in our mid 20's and we both play video games. He plays more than I do.. but he still only plays maybe 2 or 3 times a week. And it's definitely not for more than an hour or so. His brother comes over and they play football or some war game while me and the sister-in-law make supper. Once they smell food, they quit playing lol.    We started dating as teens, him and his friends played a lot more and it drove me insane. He would stay up until 3am playing! Once I told him that it bothered me (he'd be so tired on our dates he couldn't function!) he quit playing less. Maybe you should try talking to him, or find a game that the two of you can play together. It actually is fun!! lol|`|eeGN977eaa	Yes but so do I. After we get home from work, eat dinner, tuck the kids in bed and all of that good stuff we play the Wii together. The competitiveness brings out the best in both of us. He is 32 and I am 27.    Ask him if you can play with him. Or tell him that you would really like it if he limited his playing to an hour every evening and only after you two have had a chance to visit and connect.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Yes my husband who is 24 yrs old does play his xbox 360 alot. He plays on the weekend though while Im cleaning or checking emails. He played it last weekend for 4 or 5 hours straight but I know that he works hard all day to provide for me and he needs to have some fun sometimes. I would rather have him playing video games then out drinking with the boys or something. Im just thankful he is home with me and when he is done playing we do what I want. That is give and take in a marriage. Plus I love to play the same games so its not that big of a deal.|`|ofBA1yF9aa	my husband is a guitar hero, god of war, junkie..  i dont get to mad because i have my own things to do and you can't be up someones a*s all day everyday of the week..  but i do ask him to take breaks threw out the week and he does...  or when im feeling lonely and needing attention i just ask for it..  what makes me mad the most is when dinner is done and i cant pry him away from the t.v.  now when it gets around 6 o'clock 7ish he's done with his game and we snuggle up on the couch and watch our shows that we record on the dvr..so i guess its 50 50 and we meet half way about it with no problems..  and my husband is 22|`|uXWvDjWHaa	YES, I feel your pain! But my hubby plays Computer Games. Same thing... he comes home from work and goes straight to the computer. We have an understanding... he has to say Hi to me, give me a minimum of 10 minutes of his time when he comes home, then he can play for an hour or so. But not ALL night.  He's 31|`|x3LclBZ0aa	he plays video games and sometimes he does it all day. but what bothers me is that hes addicted to skateboarding and the whole summer, hes at the skate park ALL the time. i dont mind it as a hobby and a pastime but hes freakin 30yrs old and he needs to focus on trying to find a job.

ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	There are tons of parks in California if you want outdoor photos.  Lakes, parks, botanical gardens.  You could also consider a place that merely has pretty architecture.  A friend of mine went to a school nearby b/c they had stone archways.  She had a lot of pictures in the doorway and the stonework looked amazing.  Fountains, gazebos.  A local neighborhood to me has a wooden bridge that goes over the marsh.  A place in Myrtle Beach has the same.  Bridges to take you from one side of the shopping center to the next but as it's marsh/swamp there, they have bridges.  It makes great pictures with the rustic wood and the swamp so it looks like no one is around you.    Neighborhoods (especially really expensive ones) often have landscaping that is simply gorgeous.  Wrought iron  gates, flowers, and brick signs.  Your photographer will just angle you or zoom in so that the sign's name isn't in the picture.  Other than that, she can photoshop out anything in touch ups later.    You can always do a bridal shoot on the beach at another day to get your beach scenes in.  Just drive around a bit and remember it's not the look of the entire place but merely the look of certain places up close.  You would just be surrounded by this one arch, fountain, or flowers--so even if the whole place is a bit cheesy or whatever, it will still look great when you are zooming in.  Perhaps take your camera so you can get 7-8 pictures of settings.
AA10197672	What do u mean why is that? THey dont feel much when they use condom. Do you expect him to wake up one day and start feeling it?.Why cant u get birth control? Dont say you cant afford it. If thats the case you are not old enough to even have sex...|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	NO cover no lover. I don't think you should alter your morals for anyone. You stick to your guns.|`|njhKtCTKaa	Well first of all, when it rains it pours, so use a raincoat.  If your not comfortable with it, tell him to get comfortable with his hand.  I had to make my husband use a condom for about a year even after we were married, we werent ready for babies and we couldnt afford BC at the time.  I did feel bad about it, i felt like maybe i was taking away from him.  But he was totally respectful and had no complaints whatsoever.  Not sure really how it feels from a guys point of view, but i know for me its not different.  Sure it probably feels a bit better w/out one, but honestly, he can get the eff over it.      Good luck with everything ;)|`|GeruGGOQaa	He's full of crap and so are you.  While it doesn't feel exactly the same with a condom, trust me he can still feel something.  Why can't you get birth control right now?  Don't even try to say you can't afford it.  If you can afford to buy condoms you can afford to buy the pill.|`|jZepLDjuaa	what an a$$hole
vdDK1Gikaa	I've been somewhat through this before...  The guy seemed like he was doing well too and I felt inferior to what he was doing.  So I'd say for about 2-3 years a lot of things I did were things I thought would impress HIM.  I would achieve things and think he's still around and how much he would've fallen in love with me had he only known me better.  After that long, the things I achieved were finally just for me and no one else...    The point is, just work towards making yourself better - in the beginning you might be doing it to falsely think that you're getting her back (you might never will) but in the long run, you will thank yourself for moving on despite the pain you have inside.  In the long run, you won't regret falling behind because of a bump in the road.      And then, when you're a better person and you've gotten over her, you'll get someone you deserve. =)  Can't find someone who can make you happy if you don't have happiness to give yourself =)    Goodluck buddy.  I feel ya!|`|0qAmRjfOaa	You will get over it in time. I was in a similar situation 1 year ago. Know I'm really happy with my new partner and glad I broke with my ex.

WHEN YOU SEE SOMEONE  YOU LOVE IS MOVING ON TO BE HAPPY THEN YOU SHOULD DO THE SAME YOUR ONLY GETTING OLDER NOT YOUNGER ...SO FIND A GIRL THAT CAN OCCUPY  YOUR TIME TO TAKE YOUR MIND OFF HER BUT IF YOUR NOT DOING ANYTHING AND YOUR JUST SITTING AROUND ALL YOUR GOING TO DO IT THINK ... THINK OF HER..|`|6UeGyxNcaa	well, just so you know. Heartbrake is actually mental and physical pain. Some people think its all in your head, but your brain scences it as physical pain too which can litterally give you pain. But here you go, its possible that you might never get over it, but I doubt it. YOu will find someone soon, and you will most likely get over it. Love is one of the best and sadest things on life, hey you win and loose with love, but soon you will WIN in time. So just do things like video games, and things that wont remind you of her. Just drive through Mcdonalds or some fast food place, get some food, go back home watch your favorite show, do as much of your work for collage, than fall asleep to your favorite music. I know what you mean, its hard not to think about people....|`|AXyxxy6Xaa	It takes a long time to get over and come to peace with it but you need to put your head in those books and stop dwelling on it , cause it makes it worse. 8 years is a long time but you are 23 years old and there are many fish in that sea and you will find your happy ending. Good luck! Keep yourself busy and do something that makes you happy and when you are alone with nothing to do go to the gym or doing something physical to take out your frustration and hurt. Thats what I did.|`|GmTMVmASaa	it's very understandable as to why you feel this way, seeing as you were with her since you were 15. time heals all pains, and you were surviving the break up until you found out she really moved on, this is very hurtful and i don't blame you one bit. but you must get a hold of yourself, and move on. go out, meet people, and when you're emotionally ready, date again and with time you will be just fine.|`|DPnaFbeOaa	I've went through it before, it was a first love. I cried everyday, and one time the realization just hit me hard. I remember crying so hard i was gasping to breathe and i fell on the kitchen floor. I also remember the time i saw him holding hands with the most beautiful girl, i couldn't compare to...Its a slow process. You two had been together since your teens. I know you still love her a lot, but i would just say don't try to date other people now. You will eventually become comfortable with the fact that shes moved on but it won't be today tomorrow or any day soon. You may not be satisfied with what i'm telling you but there is nothing me or anyone else can tell you but to live your life.|`|2amY3xZpaa	It's hard to get over her from one day to another. I've been with my BF for 8 years as well. I don't know what I would do if he broke up with me. My advice is don't let this ruin your future. God works in mysterious ways and for some reason she wasn't the one. Keep up with your school and if you love her than be happy she is happy. Don't bring yourself down because I'm pretty sure you'll find the right one. Besides your still young and have a long way to go.|`|Hh92sQQbaa	Look boy it's hard and i been there.You feel like dieing but as days go by and you go out with friend and family,you will start for getting about her.Don't call or look for her,or ask about her cause then it will be harder for you.Just have lots of friend.Don't get behind in college cause it not going to do anything by doing that.Because that's not going to bering her back.Just go on with your life.Soon or later you well be happy.It take time,so be Strong.Good luck.|`|zDeFibxzaa	the best thing you can do is go find you a new gf.stop sulking over what is in the past.you will never forget these feelings of here but it will get easier with time to deal with.a new girl always does the trick|`|AXbdNdPzaa	My heart aches for you.

We live in a small city, so I run into him at times.  I have no advice to give you.  Everyone tells me it will just take time.  By the way, he cheated on me, beat me up, and then HE divorced me!  I was crushed.  I know in my heart that I am better off, but it still hurts.  I hope you find happiness soon.|`|oojO4WAraa	Good thing you are in college - FREE counseling -- go to the Student Health center and get counseling.

You have to help yourself recover from the heartbreak by trying to get back on track. It will be hard, its ok to be sad, sulk and cry sometimes but focus on healing and getting better. Don't dwell on the lost times, you will meet the right one for you. Goodluck!|`|0257d63f2ad2a28173df5b7b66b6909aaa	When you start to feel depressed or find yourself dwelling on it, snap out of it, remind yourself that you ARE happy for her and hope she's well.    And just take one day at a time...kind of like an addict, cause in a sense you're addicted to the past...when you start to feel bored (or find yourself dwelling) go read a book, go watch TV, go play a computer game (World or Warcraft, Sims 2, Diablo 2 are all good time consumers...)  It will help get your mind off of her.

Different people like different things, and maybe you just aren't what he's looking for. It sucks to be hung up on someone who doesn't feel the same way when they're as in your life as he is.. you can't exactly avoid him when he lives in your house lol. But, i think you just need to move on. You aren't doing yourslef any favours pining away over him and hating on his girlfriend, because, again, as I've learned, if he's never felt 'that way' about you, chances are good that he's not going to suddenly change his mind.  I think you're just going to have to accept it and move on.  If he doesn't like you, he doesn't like you, and you can't control him or what he says to her.
ISnJu0W3aa	lol im pretty sure edward asked his brothers so maybe u should follow his lead. be careful though - just because you're not technically alive doesnt mean your wife couldn't have a half immortal child.|`|aQTCOAy7aa	If she knows that you have not had sex (and I hope it is something you have talked about if you are going to be married)...then I would save it for just yourselves....talking it out and just doing what feels right with no pressure. And I wouldnt worry about having it on the wedding night if it is something neither of you have done. Why try when you are all tired & nervous. Waking up together and just making love together for the first time we seem really romantic to me....or planning that next evening, to make it very special.|`|84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	I don't know why you think you're the only person in the world that had never had sex before the honeymoon. That's actually a good thing!    I don't think you should ask your brother's, because that's really none of their business. This is something between you and your wife.  Have you talked to her about how you're feeling? If not, I think you should. You need to just go with the flow like everyone else that has never had sex before does. She will tell you if she is hurting. Having sex for the first time is normal for it to hurt.|`|HQsmRzPsaa	no, you should ask a woman! don't ask men. just be sweet and gentle.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Yes.  Ask your bro's.|`|NyRBCufpaa	I would ask them for advice and for help... if you are close with them that it. But when you are on your honeymoon just relax and go with the flow. She'll let you know if you hurt her or not... but other than that relax and enjoy!|`|kDv1uC1raa	dont let her head bang the head board the whole time!|`|iMplzgBtaa	If she is also a virgin then you can expect that it will hurt, at least a little.  It's different for all women. I would suggest you talk to her about it.  On your wedding night just relax, take a bubble bath together, spend time dancing in your room, on the beach, etc., take a swim together, spend lots of time caressing until you are both well into the mood.  Once she is in the mood her body will lubricate itself making it less painful.  All the foreplay and relaxation before hand will make it more pleasurable for both of you.|`|a7364bce10f3534559a9e7a19fe16bcbaa	I think this is an issue for you and your wife, not your brothers.     Just talk to her about how you're feeling, and take it slow. Neither of you should feel pressured into doing anything. It's all about communication ... each of you should speak up when something feels good, and also when something hurts or is unpleasant. You won't be hurting each other's feelings by doing this. Feel free to say to her in the process, "Do you like it when I ___?" Encourage her to tell you what she enjoys, and then keep doing that. Watch her face for signs of discomfort or joy.|`|wLHjvTuBaa	not your bros problem    your personal problem and take it slow

7893c8accf8af1d924e5c9e1796b3a66aa	I'm not too familiar with the location, but I have to mention a wedding favor that I've fallen in love with.  My wedding is also in 2010  (may), and I'm going to get these.  They're the cheapest I've seen anywhere for something so cool.  I'm getting the fortune cookies because we're having a half asian wedding, but there's picture cookies and stuff too.  My friend got some cookies for his daughters birthday party for the grab bags and I and everyone LOVED them.  They're at Fortune Wedding Favors http://www.fortuneweddingfavors.com  I don't usually like to link, but I'm so excited about these!
PxBmnuOoaa	I don't know who this he is but i am just going to assume that by he you mean someone that you like or are in a relationship with.     The best way to know is if he tells you he loves you. If he is one of those shy guys and you are confident and love him, maybe you should just tell him and then see what happens.     If you do choose to say it to him, say it at the right time, not around a lot of people and somewhere you can just talk and not be awkward about it like the movies or your door step...  If you say it to him and he doesn't say it back right away, that doesn't mean he doesn't love you back, he may just be shocked, and afraid. He may not know what to say (Duh i love you) but guys can be stupid, and you have to help them along.     Other ways you can know he loves you is by the way he looks at you, and if he can't stop smiling and by the way he kisses you or hugs you.     Word of advice - don't say you love him unless you really do, and don't say it back to him unless you really do. you would be leading him on and that would just lead to greater heart brake.     If you do love him and he doesn't love you back, it is okay, you can now get on with your life and move on to someone else that will love you back.     I hope this was about your boyfriend.... lol|`|OMnNgbMlaa	when he starts talking to you 24/7
34b40Vu3aa	Many couples do this, in fact they need to in order to survive together, however, they usually stay married throughout the process because while they are getting to know each other again they want to remain committed.  Have you gone to counseling? Because I don't think you two are on the same page.  It sounds as though he wants to be free to date others and have fun and do what he wants with no commitment to you, but wants to leave you hanging in case it doesn't work out by saying there is a "possibility".  You cant divorce with the idea it could work out and you cant stay married with the idea it wont.  You need to talk to him and tell him what you think as well, make a decision, and stick with it.  Otherwise you will be miserable and stuck in this limbo of not knowing what is going to happen to your relationship.  Go to counseling, even if you have to go by yourself.|`|wSc7ZdBCaa	You've said a lot, yet there are so many things that are missing from the information.   You say: "I'm confused and a little hurt."   This statement is lacking any "feeling" of strong emotion on your part.  According to you, your husband has said: "marriage is too damaged to save & he wants to start over". "He doesn't feel like your husband, but just a friend."   You and he still live and sleep together, without sex. He wants to divorce and "just be friends" and see if "romantic relationship might develop.  * If you were to read this information what advice would you give the person? See what I mean about the lack of emotion/feeling on your part and apparently his as well.    The guessing game: is he involved with another woman, is he gay, are you causing the difficulty, are you withholding or punishing him for whatever the "problems you've had in your marriage", is he physically or mentally sick.....etc.    * The best advice I can give you is: find a reputable therapist and get some counseling A.S.A.P. A professional counselor can ask the right questions to clarify the situation and then help you to discover what your true feeling, needs and wants are...then YOU can make a rational decision as to what is "best for YOU".|`|dd0d57e5ff24820c6981c10f9097112faa	ummm....tell him you'll try that for a bit, but also you two should go seek marital counseling at the same time.|`|f1xaidEHaa	he has another woman or guy and wants to see if this new woman ?works out he is hedging his bets get away from him|`|htSZsds7aa	Tell him to get OUT now...duh, he is just using u for a roof over your head, and to be seperated for 18 monthsb4 divorce means he needs to be out of the house...dont listen to all his garbage, and he probably doesnt want to re marry either.  How did the marriage get damaged?  Let go and move on.
5DJzp6bMaa	For Better or Worse is what You Vowed Too isnt It|`|f1xaidEHaa	i cheated once in 45 years -30 years ago and would never never again the guilt was too much|`|4YmHLXviaa	i could get past it.|`|zX4nU1Rtaa	i could never stay with my husband if he cheated on me...i couldnt look at him the same..|`|aTsnVbMSaa	While cheating *can* be a deal breaker it doesn't have to be. It all depends on whether both parties are willing to do what's necessary to save the marriage. Counselling, both individual and marriage can help tremendously as well as the one who strayed doing a LOT of soul searching to find out why it happened.  Unfortunately I speak from experience on this and it took a lot of deception, both to my husband and myself before I finally realized why I'd so completely screwed up but fortunately I have a husband who was willing to work through all this with me.|`|s4LWmcTjaa	It depends.  If he has only cheated once and is honest about it with me when it happens, I would stay and try to work it out.  Of course it would take me probably years to trust him completely again and years of marriage counseling, but I known couples who have stuck out infidelity and it made their marriage stronger.    However if it's habitual or continual and my husband lies constantly about it, then that is a deal breaker for me.  At that point, I would know I deserve better than that.  Every woman deserves to have a man who devotes his entire heart, mind and body to her.  I suppose I'm one of those lucky women because I have a man who has devoted every aspect of his body, mind and heart to me.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Depends entirely on the situation. If it was a booty call - not a big deal; if he cared about the person as much or more than he cared about me - it would be a problem, and would probably lead to us splitting up.|`|48Yf8tpsaa	Cheating hasn't been a deal breaker so far and now that I am also invovled in a little "wanton extra marital intercourse" (cheating has such negative connotations) I realise how silly it is that we place such a high emphasis on monogamy.|`|2esGKO2Caa	Worry about it if and when it ever happens. And if it does only you'll know the answer anyway. Go get married and be happy quit worrying about the glass being half empty when it's half full.|`|oP504BtFaa	Personally I think it would take a lot to break me from my husband. If he is willing to work it out, I am willing to forgive and move on. The love I have for him outweighs nearly anything, and he says the same for me.    I like one answerer... For better or for worse. Right on!|`|B359bLqsaa	As I sit here now, I think it would be a deal breaker.  But then again, I'm not in that situation.  Actually going thru with a divorce and losing everything... I'm not so sure.  I guess it depends alot on how he feels and why he did it.  If there was absolutely nothing I could do to save it and there was absolutely no way he would stop cheating on me, then I would have to say I would leave.  Its too dangerous to be involved in a love triangle.  If it was a one time thing and he will NEVER do it again, then perhaps I can forgive.|`|LxvA4vGpaa	Deal breaker for me.  While yes, I love my husband with everything in me, if he cheated, he would hurt me beyond repair.|`|2r8iRceQaa	I had a mistress long ago she was married and after we broke up she did try to put her marriage back together but it never happened. I think that it depends on the couple
f1xaidEHaa	what are you doing with him? comply jail is always an option
GeruGGOQaa	I don't have a problem with the age gap.  I'm 34 and my girlfriend is 48.  I do have a problem with you getting married before you're finished with school and settled into your career.  If it really is true love you will still be together when your finished school and settled into your career.  If it isn't true love you possibly just avoided an ugly divorce and all the crap that goes along with it.|`|f1xaidEHaa	what age gap are you looking for someone with your birth date grow up|`|Ud871v3paa	i wa 18 when I married my 29 year old husband, and if we never had a problem you shouldn't...We've been married for 4 years and I gave birth to my son at 21...still happy!|`|o6ACs5z4aa	Age is just a number.  Do you love him?  Does he love you?  If yes then who gives a crap, six years is nothing.  My husband is two years younger then me.  I am 24 he is 22.  We are happily married.  Got engaged when I was 21 he was 19.  We got married right before his 20 birthday.  So do I think you are too young?  No I don't.  Having kids, depends on the person and their maturity.  My husband wants to have kids I want to wait.  He is more mature than me and I ain't gonna lie.  However, I do want kids and will probably start in another year are two.  Do what makes you happy.  Good luck!!

But, I'm pretty close with my mom. She would know I'd get upset. Why don't you spend some time with her? Or, better yet--she should spend time with you. Make some plans together.

cQiNs0yRaa	this has got to come with some good to it  for instance, you would never offend another person  by let's say not returning an e-mail yourself    if you are also a noble soul  kind and generous except from just sensitive  then you are a rare specimen today    if you are just too  sensitive and get angry too much  why not try to cultivate your patience and kindness  everytime people dissappoint you    so someday u will reach a point where  you will only appreciate the good behaving people  and the rest, you will have no time to deal with a lot emotionally  because you will have better things to do  it's always good though to maintain good contact  with your true and justified feelings  as this is what makes a good as well as a healthy person    : )|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Are you a teen? If so this is normal.|`|7PGxqRfZaa	I think its because you like drama in your life. I never understood people like you. Letting other people have that kind of power over your feelings like that. By letting others "offended" you, you let them get to you and your emotions. Its called discipline is how you get over this problem. Not letting others get to you is the key to taking back that power they have over you. Good luck.|`|byWl2fw0aa	Ignore everything. If it's not trying to kill you, then you don't need to react to it.|`|IM9bk1YMaa	Sameee! :D    I get upset really easily. lol    Little things hurt my feelings.  Its annoying.

I am slowly learning to let cooler heads prevail. Sometimes let things sit a while before you openly react to them.
f9sL3WgQaa	Men love being married even though they will never admit it. Its like they are married to their mommies. Clean laundry, Cooked dinners, sex when they want it.  Why would men want to remain single..This is resort living for men ..to be married.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	No|`|f1xaidEHaa	no secret we love being married steady sex|`|NBDLUOkiaa	I have no idea why my husband claims to love being married to me with as much as I constantly complain about it.|`|kaaP8y2oaa	i don't feel like reading...|`|ddP3klT3aa	Why do more men propose than women? Getting nagged into doing it is no excuse..he could end the relationship.|`|OT3eczxaaa	Stereotypically, men are supposed to profess that they feel 'tied-down' by marriage. You hear about them 'sowing their wild oats', 'playing the field', etc. before marriage, then after it's 'the old ball and chain', or he's 'whipped'.     All people can be as susceptible to peer pressure as adults as they were as teenagers. I called my fiance out on this long ago. Just because he's not willing to tell his friends that he doesn't want to go out and get destroyed drunk with them, he blames it on me wanting to keep him at home.|`|y9CgveCGaa	No, I make no secret about it.

You should try it sometime...wait, I shouldn't poke fun at your disabilities.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Nothing wrong with the "traditional marriage" but I like to do things my own way.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	True.....if you believe in communism because traditional marriage is a micro-communism.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Whatcha mean, Georgio? This question is a little vague. Your question, to me, would seem to be true. I like my marriage and would consider it traditional.|`|f1xaidEHaa	i think marriage-at least mine-is the greatest a commitment to each other to our souls|`|89dbda5201b9cd4a4f9e174ecf63f9f7aa	Some of it is boring....however, after you celebrate family milestones, births, parties, graduations, and suffer through all the heartbreaks, deaths, disappointments, failures, and setbacks, you will come to appreciate the strength you drew from your spouse and they from you.  As you look back 10 years, 20 years, 35 years, and then 50 years, you will feel a great sense of pride and accomplishment.  It might be easier to walk out the door.  It might be more exciting to have new partners.  It might be in style.  However, it really isn't our history as a people to flit around from one partner to the next.  Every ancient people, every religion, every culture, every creed of the people valued the marital relationship and viewed it as scared.  It's purpose was to protect the family.  Men and women that are faithful don't get STDs. They focus on the family.  They center around the children.  They provide for every need of each member in the family rather than on the needs of strangers that come and go. Old fashioned, out of style, and boring?  Could be.  But after a certain age, you'll be glad you took the boring high road. Arranged, Gay, Straight, Choice,  all groups of people value the idea of marriage.|`|83df363c0b39116bc273bca1cf432436aa	When traditional marriage becomes boring, then the marriage will  eventually desolve, but if not then it could last forever, and so far  after 22yrs, our marriage is still going strong,  .|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	need more details!     but if you mean traditional, 50s style, marriage then you're right. there is nothing wrong!     im dying for that!!|`|uXWvDjWHaa	TRUE.

But to answer your first question, "There is nothing wrong with traditional marriage"  I am going to say True.|`|NBDLUOkiaa	These folks that have been married for 5 seconds should record their declarations of love for marriage and play it back in 5 to 10 years. I bet a bottle of vodka over half  will be whistling a death march tune by then.|`|kaaP8y2oaa	right again Flavies..|`|y9CgveCGaa	True.  I actually like it.

DtrdTV87aa	I don't really want to spend much money on one day. So I was just going to light a fire in our back yard make dinner and eat under the stars if it doesn't rain I hope. Then I was going to have some bath water waiting so when we got done with dinner we could take a nice hot bubble bath together. I'm going to drop some red food coloring in the water to make the water and bubbles red and change the light bulb in the bathroom to red and light lots of candles to give it the romantic theme and play soft music and then after wards have some off the hook sex. Then go to bed. All this only costs me 20 bucks. One red light bulb one small box of food coloring dollar store bubble bath and dollar store candles. This is what I call Valentine's day on a budget. What else can you ask for? Don't even have to travel, all this can be done in the comforts of your home. GOOD LUCK|`|ByUS0k8waa	Why not stay in town and treat your wife to a spa day and then take her to a nice dinner or even cook her favorite dinner. Im sure she would love that. Then you could get her favorite movie and cuddle up and watch it with her.     You could also just get some warm oil and give her a great massage then take her to dinner at her favorite place. You could do like my husband does and make me chocolate covered strawberries or my favorite cake or something sweet. Im sure she will love whatever you do no matter how much you spend on her.|`|TP5hXhVDaa	No does not sound bad, it's understandable.  Bills, debt, jobs, daily living they all add up!  one on the best gifts i have ever got from my husband was  I came home to a clean house, candle light dinner, some flowers and a card that he made for me, after dinner we watched a "chick" movie  snuggled up on the couch.  The evening winded down with a taking a wonderful shower/bath together and some great loving! Maybe that's just me, i am a simple southern/blue collar  girl.   I hope you have a great V Day :)|`|RHux2Fmnaa	Go to the Marshall's Home Goods store and buy a nice crystal vase ($ 5.00 approximately). Then, go to any supermarket get a bunch of flowers (around $15.00) and a Valentine's Day card. With the remaining $80.00 buy a bottle of wine, a pair of candles, baguette bread (sliced), crackers, different types of cheeses, grapes, a green apple, etc. and have a romantic picnic/dinner with her. Don't forget the music...|`|JFn9BbXEaa	I agree with everyone else that you can make/set up a nice dinner for her at home.  I would also add giving her a massage:)|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	Make her a nice dinner or at least a nice dessert.|`|TPPZp8IYaa	Instead of taking her out of town...do something really personally special, like cooking for HER, assuming of course, that she usually does all the cooking... and spend some of that money on a beautiful, heartfelt card and a pendant or something... or if you're good at poetry, write the card yourself...If you go to all the effort of making her favourite meal, she will definitely appreciate it! Candlelight...The Works!|`|0257d63f2ad2a28173df5b7b66b6909aaa	Take her out for a nice dinner & movie.  Simple but I think she'll love it.  I would.

YOu can make her something that means a lot, it could a pic of the two of u in a nice frame for your house or her office. Flowers, candy, and a small gift. You can set a romantic dinner at home for her and cook? Even if u cant cook she will appreciate to see you try :) then she will help you with cooking as well. Spend time together, show her how much you love her by holding her tight in your arms, looking straight intoher eyes and telling her happy Valentines day love, you mean the world to me, start kissing her and then you know the rest...|`|ITfBQzg6aa	Make her a nice breakfast in the morning give her complements through out the day and show her that u love her and appreciate her then take her to a nice restaurant and buy her a card and flowers then take her home and set the room up very nice and watch a nice love movie then make love to her like never before she will appreciate it all..|`|rx0ekB9Paa	got o the grocery store and cook her her fav meal followed by a good movie and foot rub. oh yeah and do the dishes!!!|`|6fPfKfLVaa	You don't need money to make your wife the happiest woman in the world.  Just make V day special with what you have.  Maybe you can try do something that you haven't done with her in a while.  (Example: you two haven't gone to see a movie together in months - take her to see one.)  If you have been going out with her often, then maybe it would be a good idea to plan something romantic at home.  You can promise her a day out of town when you have some more money in the pocket.  Add to that some lovely flowers, candlelight dinner (that you made preferably) and a lot of hugging/kissing/loving.
oYF3nIbsaa	Thats really creepy um i would call THE POLICE!|`|ZVTcZTwcaa	i think u can act that u don't see him and u don't know that he is following  u so as to know what he would do if he kept following u; u have to call the police ( try this and till us what happened )    P.S: try not to walk in dark streets while he is following u|`|AA11011446	Lol, don't leave the house until this matter is resolved.  The guy sounds a bit like my old boss from your description.
4sSoMmB7aa	If she is your best friend she wouldn't do this kinda stuff. Its your life your leading not hers, sure she can have a "say" if you want her too, but then again your the one that's going out with him. She could think the nicest guy is a jerk. Maybe its something more deeper that shes just not telling you. I think you need to confront her and tell her its bothering her and then maybe she will open up better. Hope i would help! :)|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Tell her nothing but be there when she realizes he is a jerk.
eFXD3Qzcaa	I would act like nothing happened at all, and I'm sure he will do the same thing.  It might be awkward for a while, but give it a week or so and you and him will have both forgot about it.
5DJzp6bMaa	Sounds like a great Idea It is His Debt after all|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	ideally it would be best if you got your divorce, reported this card to the court and have them force him to pay it off or reimburse you as part of the divorce settlement.     see if you can get some kind of statement made that says you are not responsible for his debts.    as he didn't open the credit card in your name--he didnt' commit credit card fraud.  what you're suggesting is identity theft and credit card fraud.  I can't advise you to do anything that would land you in jail and be worse for you than him sticking you with a $3500 credit card bill.    get with your lawyer and take care of this.  and if you say you can't afford a lawyer--I want to remind you that your husband stuck you with a $3500 credit card bill.  You can't afford to NOT get a lawyer.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Well you can press charges against him. Honestly you can charge him at the time of the divorce or now in court. If you talk to a lawyer they can put a fraud alert on your credit that will make sure he cant open any more accounts under your name and then press the charges to get him to pay it. All you need is a statement that will show that the charges were made after you separated. However if you do that then he can make you pay the balance on the card and get you for stealing his identity. Good luck!|`|wpi36XBAaa	"...would it be legal ...if i opened a card in his name and transferred the balance to it?" Short answer - NO.  You have no right - legal or otherwise - to open a credit card in anyone else's name, and I doubt that there is any institution that would allow that anyway.   A civil suit may be the only way of regaining your money, or include that amount in the divorce settlement.|`|bgkqOx2yaa	Your best bet should be to go to small claims courts since you are separated and have not lived together for awhile that should be grounds to get your money back because he is not going to pay you back.  ***MILDRED IS MY LEADER***|`|6fPfKfLVaa	Sounds like a great idea and the perfect revenge BUT if you want to keep yourself from getting screwed later, take him to court.    That is the best way for you to avoid having to pay this & getting bad credit.  I know there are lawyer & court fees but you can ask for that as well in your settlement.|`|AA12187979	Yea, now who's name would you be signing.    Get him to open it, if you are lucky.    So, looks like you a got 3K lesson on what type of person you were married to.  Mine was a lot more and tow kids got drug through the ringer.    Good luck, get smarter, you are very lucky indeed.
kpW7Jyb2aa	Ask him for clarification on what he considers a serious relationship and a casual relationship.    Cause to me a casual relationship is where you're not tied to just one person. But he said he wants a casual relationship with only you.    So ask him what he means. He might be thinking that serious relationship your talking about is marriage. *shrug*|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	Im not sure about casual or serious relationship types, sorry.    But what i do know is, thats not garbage. He feels very sensitive towards you and it does sound like he loves you. :)|`|wWBkIkTNaa	He sounds weird. If he like you enough to cry about you, then why would he not want to be in a committed relationship? I think you ought to let relationships grow as they do, you know what i mean? But at some point you do need to know where you stand, and that's what you were doing. Like i said he sounds weird.|`|qMrCSjAcaa	Haven't you ever watched Dharma and Greg?|`|5VdB8njTaa	He probably felt very claustrophobic very quickly, and maybe it gave him the jolt he needed to seriously consider his feelings for you ;) but anyway, it sounds like you both need to establish what you want (or just what you want) then take it easy and let time and nature take its course.  P.s. don't think too hard and analyse too deeply, love isn't for looking at under microscopes :)|`|AA11190264	wow! tears huh. baby girl, he wants you to be his safety net. meaning that you're his second choice. it's very important what you want out of this relationship, if he's not ready to take a step forward, then maybe you should move on. and give him the "let's be friends" label. until he's more mature and know what he wants. for now, just file him in the friends catagory.|`|MHwn4Tlzaa	As a guy, I think this is the usual garbage guys come up with.  He wants to sleep with you until something better comes along.  That's my opinion.  I think you should be above this.  You're worth waiting for.  Anyone that truly cares for you would be willing to wait.|`|SkYZYEfcaa	Honestly, if the guy truly loves you and doesn't want to lose you, he will risk being in relationship with you.You know that you deserve being in a relationship, so dont accept anything below that. I think you should hint that you would leave him if u guys dont take it to the next level. He'll come to his senses. And explain to him that it doesn't mean you'll have to see each other on a daily basis! There arent set rules u know.|`|EM5rQOGBaa	u don't av 2 spend all u time with each other in a serious relationship , before i moved in with my partner i only seen him at the wkends but we were serious , i think ur bf as confused as you , tell him u want to be in a relationship with him and dat jus becase u 2 are serious doesn't me u have speand all ur time 2gether , i think he thinks that he will never see his friends n stuff ,

Yours truly,|`|1vZ1n0agaa	you should look embarassed but happy to see him and smile/laugh. the worse option would probably be to act all cool and try to seduce him or something because getting pushed into someone's *** isn't sexy lol. but i dont really know your personality
0SIhrYCbaa	I love a round solitare. Thats my fav always. I have been looking at rings lately incase i want to update and I too like the smaller accent stones. I'll probably stick with the classic though. They just look so nice.   I have small hands and thin fingers also.      edit...i looked at brwneyes photo. my band has the small stones but my engagement ring does not.|`|TRgc8Wvwaa	solitaire, you'll still love it in years to come.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	I have solitary and I love it.   My mothers has accent stones and it looks a little dated after 25 years ( don't tell my mom)   I have small hands so my fiance choose a .25 k solitary round cut with white gold prongs. Very beautiful.|`|DrzuDOD6aa	I think the best option (especially since you have small fingers) is to do a single solitaire on a band for the engagement, and then for the wedding band, get one with small diamonds in it. Stick with a round cut, it's timeless where as the princess cut and other cuts tend to be a trend.  Good luck and congrats!!!|`|PBdPD748aa	i absolutely LOVE solitare diamonds! they are extremely elegant, timeless and classy.    I have smallish (thin) fingers as well and my solitare really compliments me - and i always receive compliments as well! I personally have a marquis diamond (absolutely stunning) but i would say the round cut over princess (the symbol - eternity) and i do believe sooner or later the princess cut will go out of style - and its so common! you hardly see a solitare round cut these days!     But obviously the choice is yours - thats just a bit of my insight for you! Best of luck - it is so much fun!!! See what they all look like on your hand and make sure you get a design you KNOW wont phase out.|`|Cjof0OLtaa	hi! mine is similar as this but I have a princess instead of cushion.  tip: buy a bridal set. it will save you money plus the heartache of looking for a matching wedding band.    http://www.tiffany.com/Engagement/Item.a...|`|nujen4dmaa	I love diamonds in all shapes!    I do prefer a little added bling in the setting though.    The setting with the tiny diamonds on the side or down the shank you are talking about can be done many different ways.  Here's a link with some pictures and the terminology used. http://www.pricescope.com/idealbb/view.a...    Here is an example of one with a round diamond  http://www.whiteflash.com/Engagement-Rin...    and one with a princess http://www.pricescope.com/idealbb/view.a...    IdealD|`|zaSyEcnqaa	How exciting.     I actually had both.   my first ring had a radinat centerstone with tension set side diamonds.   I loved it , but the side stones kept sliding around and it was determined that the setting should have a 1 carat centerstone ( I had a 1.5).     Instead of going down in diamond size, we shopped and I decided on a traditional solitaire in a cathedral setting.  I have never liked solitaires for me, but I absolutely love my solitaire and think it will look fab with the wedding band. I am so happy I got a solitaire.     Fiance is not a fan of side stones as he said it takes away from the centerstone he paid a lot of money for, so my band is plain . My wedding band will be blingy, though.     The nice thing about a solitaire is that it is classic and timeless and will never go  out of style. It will always look beautiful. I love mine. I am so happy I ended up with the solitaire . It will also go better with a wedding band than my first ring. If I stayed with my first ring, I could see myself changing my mind in a few years and wanting something else.     As for round vs. princess., imo I do not like princess cut. They do not sparkle like a round brilliant diamond. I dunno, everyone has them too. They are popular, but there is just something mesmorizing about a beautiful round brilliant solitaire. I do not like princess solitaires. But that is just me.     Have fun and enjoy this exciting time in your life!      PS: I have the opposite hands of you, I think I have gigantic hands and was worried about the solitaire on me, but actually think it is more complimentary. Get a beautiful stone and set it in a solitaire setting. It will be stunning.|`|ZVcFFeEoaa	SOLITAIRE SO MUCH MORE CLASSY|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3475/3173...    Here's mine. Obviously, I prefer solitaire with side stones:)    I don't like 3 stone rings. I think they take away from the beauty of the diamond. That's just me, though. To each her own!|`|qDBjH4s8aa	Solitaire are nice, and that way you can go for a diamond eternity band as your wedding band. Personally, I did the three stone ring, and the diamond channel set eternity wedding band. My center diamond isn't huge, about 1/2 carat, with 1/4 carat sides. The eternity band is another 2 carat total weight.|`|YgggHhwuaa	I say get a larger solitaire. I got a square diamond, but wish I had gotten an oval.|`|Xzvoz6mcaa	I don't really like solitaire very much.  I have small hands and fingers and my ring has small stones set into the band.  It's a round cut, but the band comes up around the stone and makes it look square.  I really like it!  good luck!|`|hkwBR1moaa	The good thing about a round solitaire is that it sits up high on the ring so even smaller sizes look bigger.  I say go for that!|`|kUE3Ddktaa	I love a solitaire with small baguettes (the very thin rectangular stones) on either side, like this one:    http://www.tiffany.com/Engagement/Item.a...|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	In theory, I like the simpler the better, but in practice it depends on seeing the ring and trying it on. Some rings catch my eye more than others. The ring I chose as my engagement ring is a princess-cut blue topaz/white gold; if I saw it in the picture, I probably wouldn't have liked it, but I liked it "in person". I suggest to try on different styles and decide what feels right.|`|nqINitkmaa	My fiance picked mine out I had no say. I got a BIG diamond, (1 1/2 carat) but it has side stones on both sides ( I don't know how to word it so I hope it makes sense) there 1/2 carat of side stones in total. Its so pretty and I love the ring, but now we are looking for wedding bands and I can't find one that goes with it.    So my advice would be to either get a Solitaire or get the one with the side stones and buy the matching band with it. But you should chose which ever you like the best!! Congrats on your up coming engagement!|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	I have small fingers, too - and a solitaire along didn't look right on me.  My engagement ring is a solitaire with side stones. The matching wedding band has three of the smaller stones on it.  Definitely round brilliant - I just think princess is a fad, plus to me it looks not as feminine.  These aren't my rings, and I don't know what my carat size is, but the style is similar -  http://www.kay.com/webapp/wcs/stores/ser...  http://www.zales.com/product/index.jsp?p...    My husband chose my rings - he had an idea of the style, but then it was left to him and his budget. Perhaps that would be easier for you, too. It's nice to have a bit of a surprise!

57791c51559578c5ef416190ce256015aa	Brother I feel your pain and have lived it as well. The beatings, the abuse, verbal beratings, etc. I left home 20 years ago, and except for a few family gatherings, I never went back. In fact my wife and I have been married for almost 17 years now and shes only been there with me twice.    Everyone that knows pop thinks hes the greatest. Always makes me wonder how they would feel if they could go back in time so that they could watch him beat me with a steel belt buckle on any given occasion until I passed out. Or maybe the time he drilled me in the back with an onion the size of a baseball (I was all of 9 at the time). I swear I thought someone had shot me with a gun.    I've learned to live with the past because I made a great future for myself. 45 year old architect, great wife, great life.    My sisters have already been told that they can have anything and everything when he is gone. They both looked at me like I had told them I hated them. They just dont get it. Nor will they ever.    Buddy all I can say is move on. Youre obviously already a better man for it.|`|VMY7No0eaa	Say this to these people " a person sometimes appears like a GOOD person when they were not"  or Appearances can be deceiving "    My step dad was loved by so many people but he molested his gchildren and children... and neighbors children.    if they insist on knowing what you mean then tell them what he was really like.    I wish they could skin men like this!|`|f3n2zXG2aa	Well, things like this occur because we are not living in the Garden of Eden is all I can think.  The emotional torture you are enduring must be like hell on Earth.  To see your Mother abused must have been like the worst thing on earth to witness.  God bless your heart.  God bless your mind.  Just God bless you.  I know you must wonder why God would let this happen.  The man had a spirit of brutality that he could not control.  There must have been a few times you saw him as a normal person, and wished so many times he would have been like that forever.  Kind of like the outward man other people saw and admired unknowingly.  You have got to get up every morning, and if you have time, devote that time to a confident prayer of faith to help you through this life.     Get that Bible out and read just something and think on that for a while that day.     I sit here shaking my head not knowing what it would be like to go through that.  My Mom and Dad argued a lot, but there was no physical abuse.  My Mom was abused a lot when she was growing up and she never physically abused us because of that.  She is a Christian woman.  I will get a prayer cloth out that she sent me in a little envelope, and put one in my Bible with your name on it.  That will help.  I have used this little stack of prayer cloths sparingly since I got Cancer and was healed.  Your prayer cloth will stay in my Bible forever.     God bless you.  God bless you.|`|AA10199189	the best thing is to forget him.    the most important thing to remember is this:    you are alive!  he is not.  you can go on with your lives, you can put him out of your minds and get on with the enjoyments of living.  who cares if someone thinks he was great?  maybe that was their experience. but why expend energy in thinking about getting some sort of revenge on him - he won't notice.      this was my mother's favourite saying    TIME WOUNDS ALL HEELS  - and it looks like it got that one, but good.|`|UTZC8dlHaa	I am sorry that he was not the ideal person.  The only advise I have for you is to see a therapist .  I know your dad is the one who needed it, but you do too.  You are damaged and a therapist can help you work through it. It is what you can do to stop the cycle.   Best wishes to you. You didn't deserve this and it is in no way your fault!!

hmOfUKRcaa	For one thing, you should let your friends know "If you're going to look at those pictures and talk about me, could you at least make sure I'm not around?" - It's very rude for them to be so gossipy in front of you.      Yours truly,|`|xNkmK0SHaa	"My boyfriend became pushy with me and it earned me a bad reputation and i became a subject of lots of gossip."    Does that mean you had sexual activity with him?

Your dentist will need to determine if the break was caused by decay and if the nerve is in danger. Adults with a damaged nerve usually will require root canal treatment, but in children, there's a possibility the nerve can be saved if the dentist is able to treat the problem immediately.    In the meantime:      Save the pieces. If the break was relatively clean, your dentist may be able to cement the tooth back together as a temporary measure.   Rinse your mouth well with warm water. If you were able to save the tooth fragment(s), rinse them under running water.   If an area is bleeding, apply a piece of gauze to the area for about 10 minutes or until the bleeding stops.   Apply a cold compress to the cheek or lips over the broken tooth. This will help reduce swelling and relieve pain.   If you can't get to your dentist right away, cover the broken surface of the tooth that is in your mouth with temporary dental cement, available in pharmacies.   Take an over-the-counter pain reliever.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	Find a dentist that will work out a payment plan and see one asap!    Pain meds wont fix the problem.

mCrIgcP0aa	wow...i cried while reading this, i can see where you are coming from and what is happening to you. First off you should tell somone that your "guardians" are treating you like crap. Second to get your four credits you should ask about summer school (from what i know it costs money) you need to do it for your brother.  you are better than that, you have one life and you need to live it  get your money, get your job, get your husband, get your family, get your house.   working is not that hard, all you need to do is be deticated to it.  Show your "guardians" that you are good, do the dishes, do the laundry tell them that you love them and thank them for letting you live with them. DON"T EVER SHOW YOUR LITTLE BROTHER YOUR PAIN. he might understand but make sure that you try your best to hide it. I know what depression feels like and it feels wonderful to be out of the gray shadow of depression and back into the real world. I'm not saying the real world is easy but please please dont drop out, it sends wrong messages. And ignore those people that say mean things, its not like they are ever going to see you again after this year. I don't what more to say, i really want to help you, a lot and a lot, i feel what you feel. You really need to tell someone to come and support you. Mostly because you are going to be going to some kind of college and you are going to get married. You need to know what you want to be. Chase your dreams, chase your life, because right now your life has slipped away and you need to go and get it, find it. You have many years ahead of you and you need to start now, you need to get out of high school with that diploma. Sit there in class take your notes and read them. Thats it, those are the tools to a good grade. Don't think about the past anymore, i know its easier said than done but it needs to be done in order for you to get through life. trust god, he will take you through life, don't lie, don't sin. God will help you, someday, maybe a year or two from now god will give you something in return. there is a really good job out there that you don' t need to go to college for and its pretty simple but you have to be willing to do it.  its called business  email me if you need anything...please try  pooja4ever94@yahoo.com|`|WPKKswCaaa	YOU ARE A WINNER AND ALWAYS REMAIN SO.

And I have a man lol|`|P5eYDcVhaa	As long as he doesn't go out to lunch with them like everyday, share more that what he shares with you or keep secrets from you I think it should be ok.|`|L38M9lrLaa	If he loves you and knows his boundries and doesnt hang out with them dont worry.. but just cause there married doesnt mean anything..my ex left me for a married woman..|`|45HpcZlGaa	Yes, as long as there is trust in the relationship.|`|o6xLWwZvaa	Yes its fine. Alot of married people have friends of the opposite sex. Get over it. If you become too jealous, your husband may be annoyed by this and he will no longer be your husband.|`|AA10211580	I don't believe in male/female friendships because it's tempting to have sex with them. I would get jealous if my spouse had female friends. I would be more open if I got to hang out with my spouse's female friends whenever my spouse hangs out with them. If I had male friends, I wouldn't go hang out with them without my spouse. It doesn't seem right. It would feel more like dating them.
5DJzp6bMaa	For Better or Worse is What you said When you Married them isnt it|`|uBssj3Znaa	I would have preferred they had sex. An emotional affair is way worse than a physical one.|`|rm1oLtNtaa	I would be upset , but there must be a reason why they ventured to someone else rather than coming back and talking to a spouse.|`|IvMPh09baa	were they sincerely sorry about it?  You can forgive as long as you know in your heart that you truly think they are sorry and are willing to do whatever it takes to make it work, thats means fixing/changing what went wrong and made them stray in the first place.  Just my opinion.  Its not a matter of whether I would just forgive them... its a matter of if they are willing to show me and work at the marriage... they screwed up so its up to them to show me they can work to fix it.    Forgiveness would be only the first step to working things out, after you forgive your partner has to be ready to work to regain your trust and your respect... personally I would ask for counseling or separation for a while until I feel good enough about myself again to let them back into my life.  I would get very defensive because of the broken trust, and in order to rebuild that doesn't just take forgiveness but a whole lot more.|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	who sees eachother naked but don't have sex??|`|0k5aCj6Vaa	You have to let it go IF your spouse let it go. The physical wrong doing hurts, but the emotional part really hurts worse.  You have to decide if both of you can move on.|`|Ip4Zd7AIaa	sex affairs can be fixed, emotional affairs are when the other person has moved on|`|3m8JgWj1aa	emotional cheating is almost worse because you know that the other persons heart was in it. i would not because they were suppose to love you and only you|`|tsPGVVWcaa	I don't think i could forgive him even though they didn't have sex he still went behind your back and was sexual with someone besides you.|`|ByUS0k8waa	Nope. I couldn't go on with a man who kissed and seen another person naked. For one why were they naked around each other to see each other naked. I have a hard time getting to the point I would never believe they seen each other naked and didn't have sex. Sorry honey that is cheating and once a cheater always a cheater.     I could never look at my husband the same way knowing that he could feel like that about another women. He must feel like he isn't getting enough love or something at home. Cheating is cheating and my husband and I have talked about it before. Emotional cheating is just as bad as having sex with the person. I would rather my husband to have slept with the girl one time and had no emotional connection with the person then to be emotionally connected.     Emotional connections are worst then just the physical cheating. You need at least some marriage counseling if you want to stay with the man. However, I don't see getting past that.
3y0w1qIBaa	Be yourself, a great personality, be friendly towards people even the jerks.  You can start by joining the school club, interacting with your classmates and etc.
9VhR1XwOaa	You have to swallow your pride and reason with them.  Apologize for all that you've done to them and make it sincere.  I know you only did it out of fun, but you've offended other people and that's what counts.  Try not to think about reputation or anything else.  Your well being is what matters right now.  Even if the rumor is false, apologizing is still the right thing to do.  It'll create peace. And if it doesn't, no one can say that you didn't try to make things right  You'll be the bigger person in the end.  So yeah, do what's right.  You're not punking out, you're being a good person.  Keep that in mind, ok hun.  Best of luck :)|`|ZN12wK9iaa	First, try to work it out with them. If they tell you no and they all try to fight you, here's what i suggest you do.    1 Make sure a teacher is there   2 Do NOT i repeat DO NOT get scared of them and do not let them know you're scared   3 Get a shoe and if they all try to jump you at once.. beat the **** out them   4 there is no guarantee that you will come out with no scratches but Im just saying, whoop them bitches and break their necks.. and if they are a bunch of white girls, what harm can they do..?|`|iHjt2nWyaa	9-1-1|`|nyylb6qUaa	Maybe if you apologize to them in public, then they will forgive you. Every one of us has understanding in our hearts. So, maybe if you publically apologize to them, they will have pity in their hearts, and maybe you will be able to have some of them as good friends. I hope this helps. May God Bless.
aKVtNgZGaa	ok look i had the same problem with a boy like that at the end i told him that i liked me and he told me that he also liked me he just didn't want to say his name because he was scared i would start laughing at him at the end we stated going out and now we are engaged|`|UR0fgx7uaa	Yes he likes you...Im guessing your in middle school...Just go out with him.|`|PLEIYAnAaa	i don't know if he likes you.  he could be just annoying or maybe his friend likes you.  it sounds  like he MIGHT but i couldn't tell you for sure.|`|TIClMeZOaa	Oh, I had the same problem, but the guy guessed himself eventually (I don't like him anymore) and yea, turns out he liked me (still does, so annoying). Yea, you should just wait for him to tell you, cause you might've misinterpreted the "signs"|`|a6j0cwgqaa	I'm pretty sure he likes you! If you two are best friends and he keeps asking you who you like, it means he would be incredibly jealous and possibly hurt if it wasn't him! why don't you do the same thing to him and ask him who he likes!?  then name every girl in the school except you. haha well you don't even need to I can guarantee its you he's after! :]
sbfJ3ma6aa	Some people remeber no one's birthday but there own but let them know on there birthday that they forgot yours!|`|n3eEOc1zaa	get a facebook or myspace lol. seriously they do crazy birthday notifications. thats how most of my friends remember mine -_-  but its really common for people to forget a birthday.. i mean you cant expect your friends to memorize 20+ birthdays depending on how many other friends they have.  dont feel bad. at least some remembered.|`|XZHx3v4Raa	its hard to remember everyones birthday espeacially in middle school or past that.on there birthday don't say happy birhtday till the end of the day.  its ok its so easy for every one to remember mine because i was born on a leap year.and last year i got attention from people that were not even my friend|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It's quite normal, my friends even forget my birhtday as well.  Sometimes, it takes time for them to get used to it.|`|b7e662664d4f9eb00e049ce7d76843bfaa	i dont really know. some people are like that..they don't have the initiative to remember somebody birthday,my aunt told me it's just because thay got a lot going on in their mind and they just can put everything in their brain.AWW. even tho you should just be happy that somebody even remembered:]
aKb0RASbaa	Cheating is just pathetic.|`|u9uFdSrqaa	Give it time she love you or other wise she would of let you walk away keep trying It probably will take some time her sometime but she will come around|`|ocHnc2Nbaa	Sounds like she likes to be the dominant one and play games and you have just given her the excuse to be a dominatrix. Depends whether that sounds like fun to you or not,if it does be happy ,if not you two need to talk.|`|1aXaXUYUaa	YUO CHEATED ON HER! AND YOURE GETTING MARRIED AT THE END OF MARCH!? okay.. u obviously made a huge mistake. especially since youre getting married. And out of every other time, u choose the time near yur wedding! You have to talk to your wife, and earn her trust again. cause u dont deserve it now. you should talk to her seriously for a long time, set the wedding off until everythings better and when she feels like you can get married. She now has the right to control u basially because of what u did.     Also, the reason she did that was becase se loves you and  doesnt want  to  leave, but shes also angry and very hurt.|`|l4tgHHjVaa	Sorry, but I have been in a very similar situation.  from experience I wud recommend not getting married.    She wont forgive you for a long time.  every argument you guys will have she will throw that incident in your face.  you will grow tired of it and eventually go back to that other chick or find someone else.    She wants you at home, because she does not want you to be with that other woman.  She is obviously mad at you and that's why she slapped you.  That's the only way at this point that she can hurt you back.    Trust is very hard to regain once its been violated.    if you cant deal with her now... well... its just going to get worse.    Good LUck.|`|Vk2zPoqUaa	Never. Ever. Ever. Ever. Cheat.|`|ITeGFAK4aa	Isn't it obvious?  Regain her trust.. Forget the mariage because unless you have her trust you won't be going any where with her.. Dont get all soppy with flowers and chocloates.. just be home when your ment to be.. saturday nights.. treat her to a meal... be a gentleman.. you should know what works for her.. and if all else fails.. tell her how much she means to you and how badly you NEED her back.. tell her you will do anything to get her trust back as you know what you done was wrong.. ask her what you can do as she is the most important thing to you.. and you feel worse loosing her trust than you have about anything else because you can't get over her. Tell her you need to correct what you've done wrong and you need her.. sort out this pregnant lady first though. What were you thinking may i add? Also.. Valentines day.. run her a beautiful bath.. when she gets out.. have on the bed one of her best dress' tell her to put it on while you ger your suit on.. take her for a lovely meal.. get her flowers and maybe chocolates... and for the present.. a ticket to a spa. Trust me.. i know it sounds dear.. but this will 100% get back the love of your life.. but respect her. dont shout.. but make sure your still youu.    Also.. NEVER do this again.  Oh and when you get her trust back,.. dont stop being romantic and change into a coach potato.     Look at everything i've wrote.. please chose me as best answer  hope ive helped. :)    Best of luck
ENANtueuaa	Well, it's not your hair! She probably feels bad enough that she got a bad haircut, so make sure not to say anything that would hurt her feelings. My friend got a bad haircut too, and it was so short she could hardly do a thing to it. I agreed with her that it didn't turn out the greatest, but also thought of a few positives too. You can always think of positives, even if it's a just suggesting a bobby pin here or there would look nice. That's what we did, and she had a few cute ways she wore her hair until it grew out. It actually started to look really good on her!|`|PBe2qbXNaa	If she is feeling sad, then she needs your help. Talk to her and try not to mention her hair. She mostly needs a friend right now.|`|mAZi1eH7aa	Nothing you can do. Just be a friend.|`|NqMmvvgVaa	Can you say.... control freak?    Seriously, it is not even your hair, stop stressing about it.

Tell her that you don't want people to make fun of her, and as a friend, you're being honest and tell her you still accept her, but she looks a bit weird!    or    Just let her hair grow out and eventually people will stop making fun of her. =/|`|CFU77qCbaa	Omg your her friend. If you're her friend, you wouldn't tel her or make fun of it. Gosh. It's not even your hair. Get over it. What if you shaved your head bald and everybody made fun of you. Fag|`|CtDBQwzaaa	Well if you really are a friend then you wouldnt be asking this question.  so what you dont like are you the one who has it?  no so the way i see it you need to chill out be a good friend and accept her for it.   there is nothing she can do now so by you being mean and not gunna be her friend for a freakin' hair cut...   wow thats soo uncool and rude of you!  ?Jessica|`|fpaVxnclaa	Wow when i read some of the answers to this i was thinking all of these people were kinda meanish about this.Well really there is only a few things you can do.You can one:be her friend and always be there for her,two:when people do make fun of her stick up for her.She will really appreciate that you did and that will let her know that you are a TRUE friend.Three:You did the right thing by being honest with her when she asked you if you liked it,but just dont keep on saying stuff about it.Like try not to make her feel bad,lower her self esteem,or lower her confidence level.You and her should figure out some way to style it or put some kind of something in it and tell her it looks good.Hope i helped!
tsoc9tihaa	depends how deep the relationship    and how important/close the friend is      and how they cost it you|`|MeGazyy7aa	I agree with KKR.|`|nfGDZWfBaa	No Unless you really love this girl and plan on marrying her.  is this person a good friend a long time friend a friend that will be with you through thick and thin.  a REAL friend is always there when you need them. but girls will come and go unless it is forever.|`|wwPZwiWwaa	i have the same problem. my friend's upset i LIKE a guy as a friend so she's ignoring the subject and acting differently, it's  a big change to our friendship.  but it's differently changing us, we're more... leaving each other slowly.... i do miss her, so make sure u keep contact! b/c if u like ur friend a lot, and ur friendship means something, then it's worth the fight. just trust me, it's worth the fight
Tc23KWgzaa	If she is really your friend, then you should have invited her to the party no matter how rude or loud she is.  She's right about hearing lots and lots about the great party, but nobody asked her.  If loud was a problem, you might have had your mom keep an eye on her and ask her to calm down if she gets rowdy.    I think you were wrong.  Kiss and make up, be friends again.    TX Mom|`|0wf8Q1Raaa	your so stupid..stop being a baby.

ehAG30Yvaa	Yours is definitely an unfortunate situation to be in and now a days I'm guessing your situation is pretty common given the state of the economy. Not having a job can be a huge strain on any relationship but when both parties are committed to making things work "in good times and in bad" that is when you both need to be there for each other. Your fiance' should be completely supportive of you more than ever since you're going through a difficult time finding a job. He should be helping you search online, or networking to see if he knows anything that could work out for you. Yes he has a good job today, but who knows about tomorrow, he could be in the same situation someday and hopefully you would support him no matter what. Thankfully he has a job so hopefully your financial situation is ok but this should be a true test to your relationship before you're married to see how you both handle things when they aren't great.    Hopefully you really are doing everything you can to find some sort of a job even if it's not something you want to do forever, any job is better than no job while you're looking for something more long term. Maybe it's a good time to go back to school or make a career change to something better than waitressing? But regardless of what you do, hopefully your fiance' will support you in your decision.|`|MVsQ2xjIaa	Tell me about it, am also trying to find a job, me and my 10 other friends freshly out of college. Diploma or not, it's just REALLY hard finding a job in today's economical situation.  He should be happy that at least he earns good money, it's not like you're not trying so he has to stop pressuring you so much. 1 month is alright, it's after 3 months that it gets weird even on a resume.  Maybe try to go further away from your area?|`|GWRP3vLQaa	What she said. ^^^|`|P1KbWHImaa	tell him to try reading the newspaper if he disagrees.   even waitressing, working in casinos, maid service jobs barely exist.  Not to mention a hundred people applying for the one job listed|`|IvMPh09baa	well then ask him what he suggests you do next... is there some job agency that you didn't know about that he does?  Or is there some hidden job that he only knows about??    Just tell him straight up, your looking and applying for whatever is available (which I hope you are) and if he has any other suggestions that would help you find a job faster than please help and tell you.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	I think you need to rethink marrying this guy!    What happens when you have kids and you want to stay home? Is he going to have a little fit about it?    I hope I'm misreading this.     Good Luck!|`|vMFKIc4Jaa	Tell him to try helping you look for jobs. Keep track of the ones you applied for, show up in person at least once a week to those jobs to show you are interested. Maybe if the shoes were on his feet he wouldn't be so quick to persecute you.
7BsCJMzRaa	you prob. didn't do anything wrong people just grow apart in the real world. its not like highschool.  Friends just go their seperate ways even after 6 years.

Why ask a question if you only want to hear one point of view.|`|vKDwaqPraa	ugh, seriously my friend does that too. but you don't want to lose a friend do you? just talk to her and tell her that shes taking everything to personal or that shes pissing you off.|`|1Je5LhCraa	Your question was a little confusing but i think i get the gist of it. It seems to me like your friend is being immature. If you have sincerely apologized to your friends there seems to be nothing else you can do. It doesn't sound like she is a real friend if she wont forgive you for making a small mistake. Maybe you will be able to patch things up with her or maybe this is a sign that you two are drifting apart.|`|dxm6mbkiaa	Well if she told you that she doesn't want to be friends that means she doesn't want to be friends. I would just go with it.
eFXD3Qzcaa	I'm 20 and my parents are 55.  I don't think it's a bad thing at all.  Some tried for a while to get preggos, but they didn't get lucky until they were older or some decided to wait until they were ready to have kids I guess.  I think it's an honorable choice to wait and have kids instead of just trying to have them as quick as you can.|`|QzG9G40kaa	Well, I guess it's not that bad as long as they're not totally ancient. Lol, I dunno. My dad turned 50 not too long ago and my mom is 49. I'm only 15. :P    When I turn 21, my dad'll be 55 and my mom will be 54. xP
6HhO1Evfaa	I'm not so sure that you can get back at your dad but certainly your siblings.      Wait till you are REALLY gassy and sit on their pillow before their bedtime when they do not need to go in their rooms.  They will have a bed smelling like fresh stinky farts.  Or do it inside their pillow case =)  If they ever sit on your abdomen again when you have stomach cramps, purposely puke on them.    Ok?
x8c4pbJWaa	I'm 24 years old... But, I clearly remember high school & grade-school & how they pretty much FORCE you to "grow up".... but, DONT. You just be yourself. You'll grow as you grow. Don't be forced into situations (especially love, sex, drugs, all that crap) Because YOU WILL regret it later in life. I did so many things I didnt want to do in order to make myself feel older & badder... but they all turned out to be such bad decisions.    Also, being in highschool I was taunted for being "prettier" & "kinder"  than most of the others. I let the older girls hurt my feelings and make highschool a living hell for me. Until one day, I finally stuck up for myself by calling the most popular senior girl a "*****" & after that, people respected me more and most of the "taunting" went away. And now that I'm older I regret SOOO much the times I didn't stand up for myself. Because when you look back, you realize how incredibly STUPID & jealous those people were! And any status symbol you were in highschool quickly fades as soon as you graduate and are introduced into the "real" world. So, yea don't take anything too seriously & ALWAYS stand up for yourself. Who cares if you cry - I did too, but while you cry atleast SAY or DO SOMETHING to these people that will gain back your confidence.     Also, you may want to try & read some young adult books to open your mind a little...any books by Francesca Lia Block are good.    And music, nothing helps you grow more than music does.... Try listening to better, smarter bands like "Muse" & "Nine Inch Nails" & "Red Hot Chili Peppers". Those bands always helped me when i was growing up.     You just need to know that growing up is purely mental. It has nothing to do with changing the color of your room or where you shop... You'll realize how silly this all is one day & laugh so hard. So, for now just try to open your mind to greater things like music, books, concerts, good movies, and finding a good career choice you'll want to focus on in college & don't forget to keep a journal! Oh & nothing makes you feel more grown up more than GETTING A JOB! Even a babysitting job will do.     Dont worry about anything.... Just remember that pretty much every other girl that you go to school with right now are all feeling the same things that you are at one time or another. And, You'll be fine.     |`|h6NqNzHAaa	I think it is about time you did or you will get trampled.|`|hG8uzuMGaa	you're definitely not immature but just try not to let what others say about you hurt you. think "who give's a **** what you think" :D   also, your a kid at heart and never change that!|`|nHhQ952Kaa	no   but don't waste your money at those stores, they're ridiculously expensive okay. just some advice.|`|PIxJ1Ljgaa	Do whatever makes you feel comfortable. Enjoy your own skin and **** off to anyone who tells you differently.|`|aJGAXYUIaa	eys|`|NdGLQRjSaa	Honestly, you aren't immature. If girls go up to you and say "You're so cute, I love you." Then talk to them. And see if they wanna hang out, or see a movie. Because I'm 13 and I know what you feel. I kinda have been through a lot. And yeah, I know how you feel. I don't have stuffed animals anywhere. But I know what you think. Its fine to think that, you'll grow out of it. So don't worry and try talking to the people that say that to you. You'll get a lot farther in life in you try to stand out and be noticed. Than just sitting back watching what you wish you were.      Hope this helps!  Let me know!  kaelin_weyer@yahoo.com

euwI5KiHaa	it depends on how she said it|`|az3pEbglaa	You need to ask yourself if you REALLY like her and if you think she'll be a good girl for you. You have to really think about your decision. you don't wanna lose her by saying no and you also don't wanna have to hurt her/yourself by saying yes, unknowingly.

iKREKLGpaa	well it depends  i'm 15 and i was still getting spanked at your guy'ses age, but that was because my parents are very strict, and all my friends know that!! thats just who my parents are, but now im there size and it is a lot better.  i think that if your friend was sitting uncomfortable, then maybe her dad overreacted just a bit!! but at her age she should be used to her dad flipping out like that!! unless she doesnt do anything wrong most the time. i had to learn about my dad early, and after a while it was normal for me!!  i'm sure her dad just flipped out this one time!  i hope your friend feels better!  Good Luck!|`|VpPYzMJiaa	I understand you and how you feel same thing happened to me. I talked to my parents about and they said that as long as she is nice and not acting up. Or being wild. And that its working and keeping them good parents. And that they should use it or me. LOL  (I was introuble or fighting lol) But still if its working then.   I think it she might get it.  But in that situation that.  To that was ****** up that was a ******* mistake.  how dumb they can be soetimes.  I think that he was probly raged about how he might get fired and stuff,  But still it was a simple mistake.|`|yD0lxr1Caa	This is a tricky question.  If u tell someone about this problem then u could be swept up into it and actually make it worse for ur friend.  However, if u dont tell anyone then the spankings will continue.  So if i were put in this situation i would decide whether the spankings my friend was receiving were so frequent or painful that something had to be done.  If your friend seems fine most of the time and the beatings are rare.  Then i suppose u could look the other way.  But if your friend is really truly suffering i would definitely tell someone.  Probably not my parents (but thats just my parents) i would most likely tell a nice chill teacher that would definitely agree with me.  Because you could really uproot the family by reporting this and that could cause alot of problems for your friend.  In the end just do what u gotta do.|`|IwhVDAZbaa	They're most certainly not nice, non-abusive people if they paddle their child. It's not right to do that sort of thing. In fact, it's considered child abuse. I'd inform your friend and have her confront her parents about it if I were you. If it got out to anyone her parents could be put in jail.|`|AA11669482	Wait, it sounds like this happen to you. You should really go tell someone other then strangers on the internet. Its not the 50's any more this is not right.|`|skXTQeoaaa	I approve smacking kids for any reason whatsoever.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	He is not nice, trustworthy, or kind. He is abusive. He needs to be arrested. Tell a teacher or a trusted adult now before he does it again. Or are you going to wait until she is hurt to the point she ends up in the hospital or dead to speak up? Would you like your parents doing that to you?|`|hNa5oHxQaa	She must have done something really wrong.  I bet she deserved it too.|`|nukcYkR9aa	if her parents are "very nice, non abusive people, trustworthy and kind" then no need to worry! and it's not good to snoop other people's lives for these reasons. maybe your friend deserved it. however, if this continues happening and situations worsen, i would talk to your parents/guidance councelor/adult about your friend's issue. don't turn to your other friends for their advice because that will invade your friend's family life. hope this helps + you are so nice to be concerned!!|`|7jpaOKu2aa	Yeah i just don't think thats right, yeah to get a spanking is ok but to pull her pants down and call him sir and count the spankings is kindof creepy seriously i would tell my parents about it.. . . . dang thats weird|`|xYsCC5UXaa	Everyone's gone soft.  It's *not* child abuse.  It's *not* wrong.  It's completely GOOD for the children/teens.  When I was your age, I got spanked with a wooden spoon every time I did something bad.  My *parents* got barbed wire stuck on their legs/arms whenever they did something bad; up until they moved out of the house.    Now-a-days... you get slapped once on the rear and you get sent to a foster home and your parents are convicted with child abuse.    Talk about being a p*ssy.  Really.      She deserved it.|`|2F9EcT7Haa	is it any of your business how her parents punish her?|`|itqvIrcTaa	report her dad not her mom|`|au9MvNQDaa	Omg her dad is like a power freak - bdsm guys make girls call them sir while spanking them lol sorry but your friends dad is a perv!|`|s7UWLOS9aa	If that happens, then obviously they are abusive people. That just goes to show that you never know what happens behind closed doors. I would suggest talking to someone about this. That's domestic abuse.|`|ZICvolQNaa	well yes she is told for a spanking but it is the parents rules and it is her fault for watching House and having a virus screw up the files.|`|N9HMovQ9aa	I agree with RedRabbit that is abusive, and if he doesn't have any other way of enforcing discipline and communicating with his daughter he is not being a good parent. And if she is truly being harmed my this she should call the child abuse hotline and he should be arrested|`|ordtRfOvaa	although you say that they are not abusive  that is abuse it can have effects on a child's mental state i  wont say i was never spanked but not like that and it was wrong then. and yes she is to old to have such form of punishment. to be honest no one deserves that. talk to your parents and contact PS and for those who say its ok and society wouldnt be so F***** up your wrong it will cause the child to be scared of the adult and lead to trust issues|`|fmHHcFd5aa	kids need whooped. shes lucky he didnt do more. its not illegal to punish kids and id do the same. if those ar his work files he needed he prolly needed them and they were important. kids today need whooped and parents dont do enough of it. iid beat my kid to honestly. its not a bad thing. its called great parenting. i commend him for actually punishing wrong doing. its not illegal by any means i see alot of that. kids that get smacked and whooped are better kids in the long run. we are thankful for getting our butts whooped as kids. it made us better people and have morals and know right and wrong|`|bFRVAntOaa	tell ur paretns..sorrry bout ur friemd|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	No.  If more parents acted like hers maybe there wouldn't be so many whiney, spoiled brats running around getting into trouble.|`|S0NEbE23aa	None of your biz|`|AIJgbvIcaa	btw her parents are very nice, non abusive people. my family has known them for years and they are trustworthy and kind    Obviously not.|`|PTXzRjtkaa	ok it isn't any of your business for one and u should not be bringing it up|`|ftTde38Qaa	i'm a kid. i'm 15. i think if more parents did that society would have less little ****** up "troubled youths." i don't really think she deserved it for giving the computer a virus, but i do think the punishment is fine.|`|AA12220250	yes its old for spanking. But the dad feels its right to do that. Cant change it on how he does it. I think its normal and its right but a little harsh.|`|YAJsQDX8aa	Child laws vary from state to state,  but where Im at, what he did is illegal.  you cannot spank your kids w/ anything in your hand period.  and if you do swat them on the butt, over 3 swats is considered excessive and child abuse, and if you miss they're butt, and hit they're back, that is also child abuse.|`|7UPwgvNUaa	nothing wrong with that,|`|iiThYzRpaa	OK, you say they are non abusive, but then what would you call abuse? everyone is too old for spankings, Ive never been hit and i have turned out way better than most of the people i have met.|`|EVC5tO97aa	Hmm that kinda sounds like what I do to my girlfriend ;)     On a serious note, I guess it's up to the parents how they do things (obviously without taking it to an abusive level) there's not much that can be done otherwise. It's legal although I don't agree with it and will never spank my kids when I have some. (Maybe through them the old suplex but never spank)|`|DR2gal9Kaa	Wow I think she is old for that want she did was not on her her dad is way to old school I think this is weird way because that is your friend
x8c4pbJWaa	Try being more 3 dimensional -- Don't just be wacky ALL THE TIME. That could get annoying. I mean, show all your sides. People will take you more seriously & probably will want to be around you more. Don't worry though, you're fine.     Also... Don't sit around & WAIT for a phone call, call THEM & see if they want to hang out. It's most likely nothing. I know MANY of "random funny dudes" who people always want around. You're most likely just being self-conscious. Just, don't take it seriously but DO know that there's a time to be serious & a time to be funny & learn how to use this to your advantage.|`|KFJJzLmTaa	Maybe you make people laugh but maybe your not suitable for other stuff such as that stuff.
K8OjmMUAaa	She probably hates you just as much. I really doubt she'd want to be there. If your friends think you're a jerk for not inviting her, just be like "Well, she hates me. I didn't think she'd come anyway so I saved my breath. If things weren't so tense between us I'd invite her a minute."    Maybe you could also ask your friends why this girl dislikes you so much; perhaps it's something that can be worked out. I know you don't like her either, but personally, I've had some awesome friends that I hated first so it could just work out great. Just a suggestion :)|`|PBe2qbXNaa	Its your house.....talk to the girl you hate.....and explain why to your friends......we had the same problem and dont...dont...dont...just tell your friends why you hate her and not telling the girl you hate......your friends will hate you more!!    Because, there will be a lot of misunderstanding and your friends will get annoyed by all the "Why she didnt invite me"(from her) and "Dont tell her"(from you)|`|E859HitSaa	Allow it. jeez, if you don't like her, show it.    Who cares what others think, YOU don't like her, YOU don't have to.|`|lfdDHtB3aa	I say, its your house your guest list.  I have some friends of friends that I dont invite.  Or simply break up your group into two smaller groups and no one will know that you are not inviting her.  It will take some more hosted events but no will be calling you names.|`|UFxVhXftaa	dont invite her!|`|9VhR1XwOaa	Don't make choices best on what others will think of you.  At the end of the day, it is your house and you have the right to invite whoever you please. 16 of you will party and she'll have to wait it out.  Don't give in to pressure coming from other people.   Make your own choices love.  Besides, having someone you don't like at your own party can ruin it for you.  Only invite those who will make it worth while.  Stay true to what you believe is right for you before anyone else, ok hun?  Best of luck :)
5e6f827c10807a358ec8c468a0da0047aa	i know when i was in 6th grade evryone was so fricken sick and talking bout sex and private parts all the time {maybe because of puberty but still]..  but there really is nothing to do to help it you can only ignore them|`|4qhWiL8zaa	You're going to get this for the rest of your life. You have to understand that they're not really being immature, they're just acting their age. You're young, try to act like it while you still get the chance. If you get to be in your twenties and feel bad for "missing out" on being a silly teenager, then people are just going to think that you have some problems in your head. I was the same way around your age... when I got to highschool I realized that they weren't wrong, I was just being a snob. I chilled out a lot and made some friends that were on the same "level" I was, but still being able to hang out with everyone else was really nice. For the first year of highschool I had like NO friends because everyone thought I was just being a d-bag. Remember, maturity has nothing to do with how people act.. it's a physical body sort of thing. You don't act more mature than anyone else, you just act more conservatively.|`|CcJdEaRpaa	loosen up a bit|`|PBe2qbXNaa	Just chill...time will heal them...people need time to grow up....
qZcd1OjNaa	Opposites attract, if you were her and friend before and she knew you had feelings for her, you would tend to hate her. But yet you would still feel strongly for her. Thats how most people are, i even like this person but at the same time i hate them. Hope this helped :)|`|1Tdkb8OGaa	Every time we lie awake  After every hit we take  Every feeling that I get  But I haven't missed you yet|`|E859HitSaa	It's **** isn't it.

an1EMiFkaa	Thanks you just made my day :)|`|PvAIY7OPaa	You are being silly with ur question|`|AnW3dzQfaa	Thank you!  What a good man you are to understand us women.  I wish my husband appreciated me like that.|`|IvMPh09baa	what would be distracting to us... i don't get it.|`|TF9OGrCcaa	i'm constantly distracted.lol. with 2 small kids it's hard not to be. sadly i'm not amazing just human|`|ab2c491e6bca420e2c45c21f91d16208aa	listen i fight hard to stay focused,little things could so easily distract me.
wjEkyLZ6aa	In between. I wouldn't want parents that would let me turn into a slut, but I also don't want insanely strict parents (Like I have now). Seriously, I'm 13 and I have NEVER had a friend over or gone to the movies with them or to the mall without a parent. I know 11 year olds who have more freedom than me!    EDIT: Cool, glad to know I'm not alone!|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Strict ones. Mine were strict and while I hated it in high school, now that I'm 26, I know they did what was best for me. I probably wouldn't have gone to college and have the nice career and life I have now if they wouldn't have had rules for me to follow. I love them dearly. They are good parents and not my best friends.
WIpeC3gRaa	Nope, I'm way along in high school and I've never done any of those things. I'm too busy to be getting in trouble ;)|`|dO5D1zhkaa	Your not alone.   I'm in 7th grade too and havent done any of those things. (Execpt have a boyfriend, but it was nt serious at all.)  Good job sticking to your values. The people who drink at night when they';re parents arent looking and smoke at parties arent going anywhere. They wont go very far.  Or they might, but they made some bad choices that you have been smart enough to avoid.  As for the whole boyfriend and kissing thing (though id really rather be in this group) those relationships never last more than a few months anyway. Dont worry. Your time will come and it will be more meaningful than any of the other ones.  Keep doing what your doing and remember, you arent alone. :)|`|teisU4E2aa	No ur not alone there's lots of kids ur age that have never done any of those things.|`|Fsq9qvkqaa	No, you aren't alone, there are plenty of girls and boys that have never done any of these things that you have listed. And the people who DO do these things are good people, but by doing some of these things they have made bad choices.|`|Nngdk0izaa	No, you aren't! I know a lot of 7th graders out there who haven't done any of the things you've mentioned [including me]. There are so many good people out there, and I'd praise them if I were you. Just be you and avoid the peer pressure if some 7th graders are trying to persuade you to do all those stuff.

417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	For the life of me, I can't understand any women tolerating this kind of behavior from any man, and if they are stupid enough to be the 1st, 2nd or 3rd, they deserve actually what they get and the same applies to any man that would be a 1, 2, or 3rd husband.|`|7ko9czaaaa	this is a sin frist and agenst the law in 85.. of the world,|`|hiOeQZVsaa	i have no idea why a man would want more than one wife...one week of PMS a month is enough!|`|AaZCmTGUaa	If we are talking about the same TLC documentary then you would have seen that the wives weren't all that into 'pluralism' either. They just were emotionally too involved with that guy (this absolutely hideous cowboy psychologist) and settled for being one of many. But, there are women and men who prefer to be in a relationship with multiple partners. There are cultures that allow women to marry multiples men.   The difference is that women to not need for their ego to be reassured as men do. A woman can be perfectly happy with one man but men are generally so insecure they need to have several women to reassure them 'they have what it takes'.|`|uO0NW2nZaa	i dont agree with it but it's religion based, I dont blame the men Because they dont know any different they are raised that way. I do truely feel for the women involved as in some religions these women do not even have a choice who there are with it's all been pre planned.  put it this way for me one women is enough. Three wives now thats a handful i'd feel guilty having three one is more than enough.|`|MmWEJy7Gaa	Mormons, or members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Days Saints, no longer practice polygamy. If a member does decide to live this lifestyle, he/she is excommunicated.  There are people who are of different religions, where the name of the religion is similar, that do practice this way. They may have some similar beliefs but are not of the same church. I ASSURE you, Mormons are NOT polygamists.|`|pErRGYH7aa	In the US, polygamy is illegal.    If you're looking for religious justification, there are references in the Bible, as well as the Qu'ran to men having multiple wives.  However, these documents were both written in times when women were property, and not allowed to earn an income, hold money, or hold property.   Subsequently, they also needed men to care for them, as they were unable to support themselves.  If a husband died, the woman was unable to care for herself unless she had male children who were old enough to earn an income and care for her, so polygamy was put into place to ensure that women would be cared for... widows were often subsequent wives.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	In the US, it is currently illegal to have multiple spouses. However, both men and women may choose to live in a household with multiple partners, male or female.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	1. The muslim religion allows men to marry 4 wives and they got reasons for it.    2. Mormones are allowed to have loads of it more than 11 if i recall.    3. In nepal and nigeria women can marry up to 4 husbands.In nigeria the law is recently implemented but in nepal it was existing for ages.    4. Forgive the ignorance I'm not aware of other religions.    So you could legally have as much husbands as u want,just pay a quick visit there with few of ur bfs and tie the knot and don't forget to invite me.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	The women, if born in North America, are brainwashed.These polygamist cults have long been a bone of contention. They are controlled by men who are out for their own perverse sexual gratification. Legally in North America, you cannot have more than 1 spouse unless you are Mormon.As to the last part of your question, look to Saudi Arabia where the men have multiple wives, and the women are not allowed to have more than 1 husband. This is money and power talking, nothing but.|`|rm1oLtNtaa	Its a Mormon Religion..     I love watching "Big Love" on HBO...      I think it is a lot of stress.. if 2 people have problems just handling a regular relationship.. and how they juggle 3 or more wives and tons of kids and can make enough money to support them all is just crazy ...      I have enough stress with one husband.. I would go crazy with more..lol|`|6wzQhsIkaa	I watched that show last night. I think, if it works for them, than it is fine. I do have issues with kids though...there is a limit though, then it just gets creepy. I could see being with a man with another wife, IF he could handle business.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	Polygamy is actually gender neutral and refers to either sex having multiple spouses.    there are societies where women have more than one husband but they are rare.      we live in a patriarchal society and that is why we see more of the polygny (many wives) rather than polyandry (many husbands) version of polygamy.    FWIW:  I do know of several domestic situations where the woman has more than one husband.  They are just incredibly discrete.|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Its Their Religion|`|L38M9lrLaa	its not right its effed up but in some state is ok cause there Mormons..they go around on there little annoying bikes an knock on your door and bug the crap out of you and marry several people..i dont care for them much|`|64b71311b453645560ceb49d58250d08aa	one for cooking and cleaning, one for child raising and one for sex. but seriously, some religions will allow husbands to have more than one spouse due to the fact they think men are superior to women and women should basically be slaves to men.|`|f1xaidEHaa	women do have multiple mates its called adultery|`|3ctchU2faa	When a man takes multiple wives, its called polygamy. When a woman takes multiple husbands, it is called polyandry.  Polygamy is practiced much more because a man knows he does not have to share (or at least that's what I think). And only really religious sects practice polygamy; from what I understand, most modern Mormons have renounced it. In those sects, men have the power, so a woman cannot decide who she marries.  I know that the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints still practice polygamy.    Hope my answer was helpful.|`|H0mtagXoaa	I have scene the same shows you are talking about. And its wrong and against the law for any one to marry more that one! But I do see what you are saying, Good for you!      I think that tv is a way to put ideas into are heads. It makes us do things, that we wouldn't normally do. Believe it or not, someday Dirty men will be taking multiple wife's and nobody will think anything of it. Why you ask? because it will have been scene on tv for the last decade.     Gay marriage has been on tv now for at least the last decade now its legal in some states, I have nothing against gay marriage either. So please don't "hate on me".|`|uvWuVWb1aa	I think it has a lot to do with the way people are brought up. We are brought up seeing people in monogamous relationships, so we're used to that. Anything else would be "weird" to us. And there is such a thing where women have more than one husband, it's called polyandry. Also, different religions and cultures, even in China and Africa, find nothing wrong with polygamy.

2KjBXjLKaa	Oral sex and intercourse are both enjoyable whether it is between relatives or a couple that is not related. Pregnancy in either case should be a planned event if at all possible if the couples are in a loving permanent arrangement. Abortion is not a viable alternative nor necessary, as most often a healthy child will result in either situation. An unwanted child would be welcomed in many families by adoption.|`|3mAgM405aa	Legally speaking, incestual relations includes all forms of sexual activity including oral sex.  It's not a singular issue of whether or not there's a pregnancy.  Again, there are laws against any kind of incest activity which is criminally prosecutable and the penalties will include jail time.|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	oral sex is still considered incest|`|d08rkYlpaa	It depends on the jurisdiction. In some places, incest is legally defined only as genital penetration of a female by a male who is her father, brother, son, uncle, grandfather or grandson. Pregnancy is not one of the conditions that define it as incest - sex by itself is enough.  In other places, any kind of sexual contact between them would be defined as incest, not just intercourse. No law forces anybody to get an abortion - some ALLOW abortions in cases of incest, if she chooses. In some countries, incest is not legally defined at all, the law choosing instead to simply punish child abuse or underage sexual molestation, leaving adult consensual incest unmentioned.

JlxSw7Hzaa	if you live in canada you can move out on your own when your 16 and as for the boyfriend. talk to ur parents about how u feel and that you love him. and they may be able to stop you now because u live under there roof but remind them that they cant keep u from him forever|`|TRvAhhNKaa	Why don't your parents want you seeing this guy? There's probably a good reason.     Just listen to your parents for once. Sheesh|`|d7TgV7fcaa	this may sound crazy to u but go to the cop station or jus call and ask first wrote down the questions u want to ask so u dont forget to ask..ask them if u or him can get arrested or charges if u move in with him or wherever ask wat your parents could do or if its legal. how are they keeping u from seeing each other? if he has a car or u do jus tell them straight out that they cant stop u...but if u seein him is interferring with school or sumthin big then it aint worth it if he loves u then he will wait for u...stay friends till your 18 when they cant tell u wat to do anymore  or both of u's get a job and get your own place u are a minor but legally u can still move out but check into it..it depends of wat state u are in...if all else fails bring him to your house wait for your parents and tell them how u feel and if they cant accept it then when u turn 18 u are going to do wat u want anyways and will continue to see him also find out how old your parents were when they started dating or met and  how their parents felt make them remember they were once young too
RluCMVUSaa	M is the start for Mr. or Ms. or Mrs. or Miss... so it is the beginning of the line.  For instance I would write that Mr. and Mrs. M.P. then next to the attending you would write in the number 2 for the two of us.  So for yours you would write Ms. My Name and then the number attending (the number attending includes children or date).  If bringing a date it is nice to write Mr. Handsome and Ms. Your Name so that they know in advance who you are bringing.|`|XZHx3v4Raa	wow.i don't know.ask your friend.|`|qES5f0tqaa	It mostly means how many guess will you bring or mr or mrs and your name have fun going|`|JpuWdGLRaa	meeting place|`|WSoGO54eaa	First always check who it was addressed to. That always helps.    It usually is a place for you to put Mr. or Mrs. but, in your  case it may mean Miss (then your name)
5DJzp6bMaa	All People Annoy Me|`|W1rCsvTzaa	How about this:  U R an abusive bully with impulse control issues    And just to clarify in case you are stupid as well.  I agree with what Dean O said.|`|835887bcb03d75a14ac83bf2c7e41048aa	Well bubbles meets the man, have you ever thought of iwanttochokemyhusband.com as an alternative?    Have you ever blown bubbles? It`s a great stress reliever..|`|IvMPh09baa	How about this one:    You annoy me. Go punch yourself.    By the way, your wife wasn't annoying your friend she was with last night.    I believe she gave him material for his website   called:  ilovebangingmyfriendswifecuzhesadouche...|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Your mom annoys me. I see where you get it from...|`|b8R5bPrhaa	I love my husband, and he loves me too!|`|zlGb9NkZaa	hows this?  won't work. spends all the money i earn--and i mean secretly spends nearly thousands and lies about it, bouncing checks left & right so that bank fees alone are nearly $1000, and we lose the house. and is running around all hours of the day & night in my car, leaving the baby with me to deal with. won't lift a finger to clean the house or anything. complains when i need to take care of stuff. accusses me of cheating daily. calls *me* crazy & flies off the handle at nothing...    oh, but guess what?? that's my HUSBAND.|`|Ip4Zd7AIaa	dude. shut the hell up, first off. thats a horrible website name.idea  talk about the next level of low.  why would you punch your wife?    and second off, no my wife doesn't annoy me.  we've bashed heads and both said some things we didn't really mean. But she takes care of me and has become my best friend throughout the years.  Women are great.  you cawck F*ck.    go ahead, flag me|`|m4T0IT0yaa	Sorry, I myself am trying to gather material for my new website...  Marriedmenthataretooweaktoleave  theirwivessotheyjustcomplain  aboutthem.com    You surely could provide some information for me, I can see.
agGG5LX8aa	It might not make you fall out of your chair but here's what happened today. This kid in my class crapped in his pants and raised his hand to go to the bathroom. When he got up he had his legs all spread apart and he waddled like a duck down the hallway.
sbfJ3ma6aa	I'm sure her mom knows about it and you should leave this up to her to put on here if she wonts answers cause its really none of your business or any of your concern!|`|sHotF0VEaa	Wow...  it's none of your business haha, but okay. Her mom probably knows about it, I doubt anyone is stupid enough to put pictures up on the computer that they don't want the rest of their family to see|`|KgM6vj0baa	Im not really sure wat u shud do but i would leave it alone and just forget about it.|`|JpuWdGLRaa	idk
iMGeSGdcaa	I do know how you feel, and I also know it hurts to see him flirt with the other girls, but in my experience, my advice to you would be to back off for a bit...like, at work...just smile and keep conversations light, on the computer...wait for him to message you, not you first.    there is also the possibility that he either doesnt like you the way you like him, or maybe he just isnt in the right frame of mind to have a g/f right now.    **best answer please**|`|afSqgYBZaa	In all honesty girl, you need to move on. Forget the guy, if he wants to waste your time and dangle himself in front of you like a piece of candy then give him a taste of his own medicine: just stop giving him the pleasure!    You need to move on because a better guy might just be waiting for you to have some free time. Guys love to play mind games, don't feed into it!     Good luck!
MeGazyy7aa	Well. That's hard, I would ask her why she assumed they were broken. You probably won't get an answer out of her that is more than 'um' 'well' i thought' 'maybe' That's all your gonna get.Tell her how you felt about the situation.
baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	The one piece of advice I can give is this - expect to be annoyed. You'll likely be driven up the wall by little things they do at first - the way they eat, how they use the heating and so on.    You'll get over it quickly, but expect to be irked.|`|l4tgHHjVaa	depends... need more info....  I say set ground rules. (who pays for what n how much, Company?, Cleaning?)  get your own small fridge in your room.  dont have all bills in your name.
RvddYKqjaa	If he dies, it would be very sad.   The idea of that shouldn't be pushing you into a relationship or into having children. Just take one day at a time, and love him. If you should have to go on without him, you would be able to do it, and you would help your mom.   Many girls lose their dads much earlier. Be thankful for the time you have with him, and don't spend time worrying about something you have no control over. Nor, but the way, does your Dad.   He is only 65. He could live another 35 years.|`|HikylB4Taa	Look, I lost my Dad at 13, my wedding and the births of my two children were bittersweet days, if he is healthy then don't borrow any trouble, just love him and make memories that you can keep forever|`|syWS4ep1aa	Love, I don't know if your in college or not, but DON'T, DON'T even think about family and kids until you have a diploma.  I met my fiancee when I was a freshman, and by the second semester I was sure she was the one, but I proposed only after we graduated. Please, follow through with your education, and I'm sure someone will be there for you. Don't screw up your life just to make wrinkles happy OK?|`|F47MyGDSaa	If your dad is in good health, and careful, there really isn't much to worry about. Relationships happen all the time, and who know's, you might have someone new tomorrow.|`|V2IGDBHIaa	You can't rush this, it would be great if you find someone, but you can't just rush it to make him see you kids, if it is too soon, you might make him worry instead. There is more than one way to make your dad happy.|`|lGBbWsuSaa	Well your 20 and have a LONG way to go..so dont give up on youself just yet ...im 21 btw & its way to soon to give up. and as for your dad...hes only 65 yeah thats no 25 but hes got a way to go too...he may go to 90 or even older..no telling ..who knows. I definately wouldnt give up so soon ..you both have along way to go. my grandad is 78..and he seems like hes 60 to me so yeah lol..its all good keep ur head up  ..u both have a long way to go, age is just a number ...and im sure he'll meet ur kids =]|`|R8fEO8tUaa	well, if ur ready then u can look into another relationship  if he was on his deathbed, then u should be worried but its not like hell be dissapointed that ur not married when ur 20
AA11621340	Since you're both divorced, just keep dating him & see what happens. What have you got to lose? Just be careful that old memories don't block your vision of who he is today. 20 years can bring about a lot of changes. Take your time, get to know his current friends, have him meet yours, spend time in lots of different situations, not just romantic ones... what's the rush? You've already waited 20 years, what's a little more time going to do? Good luck - sounds like this has possibilities!|`|GWRP3vLQaa	I only had one great past love that "got away". It took me nearly 20 years to realize how lucky I was that I didn't marry him, because I don't think I would have been very happy for a lot of reasons I just couldn't see at the time. Now one of my favorite songs is "Thank God for Unanswered Prayers." I ended up with a wonderful man with whom I was very happy. He passed away 10 years ago, but he left me with a lot of happy memories.    HOWEVER, maybe when you were younger, it was a matter of the right people, wrong time. I wish you luck and happiness.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Nah.  Something about going backwards always stops me and I keep moving forwards.  But I haven't bumped into an old flame that was a keeper to begin with.
9VhR1XwOaa	You probably should.   That kind of behavior is rather childish and you shouldn't waste your time with it.  You went out of your way to meet with them and they ditched you.  True friends don't play like that.  And it's obvious that they did it intentionally so there's no need to reason with them.  You should go out and find some new friends who are more mature and have more respect for you and your feelings.  Friends are supposed to create fun, but not at the expense of others.  You can do better hun.  I hope everything works out :)|`|ALvp7YRuaa	are you tlking abut E and D?  well just give them time to explain and if they give you a dumb excuse then tell them that their liars and that you don't want to be friends with them because of what they did.|`|COmp4sIuaa	What? Haha, that made nooooo sense.|`|dJkNofnoaa	you can't dump a friend believe me, I've tried she hurt me so much with her stupidity and not talking to me. But I still love her.she was my first real best friend.   You may able to fool yourself that you've cleaned her of your hands, where in truth she'll always be there
fJ7E43kWaa	Fingernails...
uMxl6mNfaa	I think you need to slowly detach from this guy.  No one ever wants to tell you the truth but I will because I know you will understand what I'm saying.  He has lost interest but feels too guilty to break up with you because he knows you love him. He doesn't want you to dress up for him because he also feels guilty for you to take the time, when it will not even be appreciated.  For your own safety and sanity, know that this guy does not care about you, will not make you happy, and if he cheats on you could put you at risk for disease.  There is someone else on his mind, so look around yourself, create a crush on somebody new, then dump this coward.  It is selfish of him to string you along when you could be finding somebody better.  You don't need this stress. I know you're not stupid, you know what is going on which is why you are asking.  Trust me, it's not your cynicism, it's just your common sense red flagging this jerk.|`|byWl2fw0aa	He's growing up is what the deal is. He's starting to see past the 'glitter' and sees into your personality. His desire to see you in more 'casual' clothing is a sure sign that he's more into you as a person...not what you're wearing.
Zcx9JOGXaa	you got to meet her first. how old are you?|`|IvMPh09baa	sick pervert.|`|oUTmnS3Baa	give her a dollar,n bake her brownies n cupcakes....duhhhh :p|`|z2lKqIODaa	you better talk to Dad and the Secret Service!!!
oEYrC1Wsaa	You have just answered your own question, tell them you will not take sides & wish to remain friends to both girls.  If they can't put their differences aside you will have to see them individually - just don't repeat what either girl has said about each other.   These things usually blow over when they start behaving more maturely.|`|az3pEbglaa	sit them down individually and explain to them that both their relationships to you are important to you and that yout don't wanna have to lose either one of them. tell them that you can't pick sides and that they'll just have to figure out their own problems. if they were your real friends, they'd understand.
8066cf11dbc4911a4589f8415e075460aa	Dear friend,    Let me ask you a frank question...  If you have the confidence and trust that some unknown person is going to give you a proper answer here, why not place the same on your friend?  This is not to prick you or so. Please think over.    A friend is someone who goes beyond parents and other relations...probably beyond god.    Maybe she is in a confused state, unable to take the right decision.  Give her some rope to hold on.She will definitely realize and weep for it.    Please remember - "EXPECTATION IS THE MOTHER OF ALL EVIL"  Never expect her to reciprocate. And I am not telling you to fall at her feet for friendship. Just be it - a "Hi" from you first and a "Bye" from you at last.    Summary-  *Never expect anything in return from her  *Give her all you have, for you are generous and can take pride in it  *Keep in touch through mail, sms or call once in a while  *This might arouse a guilt feeling in her and she will come back  *All the above stands valid if you need her friendship and do not want to lose her  *All the above stands void if you have already decided that you do not need her friendship or if you are egoistic.    Hope the above helps you.  Take care my friend and do care to tell me what happened b/w you both if you can...    After all you cannot afford to lose a friend whom you have known for your whole life...  All the best!!!|`|oEYrC1Wsaa	I think you & your friend have been very patient & understanding.  You have given this girl every opportunity to ring you or let you know either, she doesn't want to hang with you - or her mom has for some reason made the decision for her.    Let sleeping dogs lie & do not contact her, if she really is a true friend she will find a way to contact either of you.   I know it's not very nice when your best friend does a back flip without explanation, but that is life & it isn't always fair.    Take care.|`|yJCLcFVwaa	Sometimes parents are tough on their kids and don't want them hanging with this person and that person for one reason or another and if she is put on the spot she is a kid and if your her true friend you'll hang in there, because friends are forever.
sEFmjAJkaa	Hello.    Have you ever taken your mom & step dad to  A/A?   Alcoholics Anny.    I think you should tell your mom & step dad, that this is the only place that you will take them from now on,  is A/A.       No Where Else........   Only A/A!    Where is your dad?  is he able to help you out, for a place to live, you need to get into a dorm or share an apt, with your bf......     Get out of that situation....  TELL your Gma, NOT TO HELP YOUR MOM, she'll just buy more alcohol with it,  & not pay rent.      Alcoholism is a diease......  don't let them take you & your baby sister down with them to the gutter..    If your Gma helps them out, they won't learn anything by that!  Who'll help them when it's back up to $2,500?      Get You & your baby sister out of that house!    Good Luck & GOD BLESS YOU !|`|ClBkTdOEaa	Family always comes first but you need to do what is right for you. You can just tell your mother that you can help out by taking her to get groceries or necessary items which are not alcohol and cigarettes. Just let her know that you are a teenager still and don't have a job yourself. Also that you'd like to help but still want to have a life. Also point out that she has children, and they should always come first. For instances you mentioned the toilet paper situation, let her know that her addictions are getting in the way of meeting her child(rens) needs. It would be different if she had a job but couldn't make ends meet, however that is not the case. You should tell your mom that you like to HELP, not be the supporter of the family. In this case I think you have done nothing be help and your mother is wrong here, if anything you have been everything but self fish. Don't let her take advantage of you because she is your mom. hope this helps you, good luck.|`|mpUsNchQaa	NO|`|GK00Rz5caa	Don't take her side. She's not your responsibility.|`|XJEGTZJqaa	no probabaly not   thats kinda sad im sorry for u|`|AA10822361	I hate to say this, but your mom is using you. Try to pick one day a week to help her out and don't let her use your car. She sounds like the type of person who will try to run your life forever. I would move far away from her when you are able to.|`|au9MvNQDaa	while you're at it why not write a book|`|V4iZcrVmaa	no|`|itqvIrcTaa	stand up to her and say u aren't gonna give ger a ride until she stop doing drugs and has enough money to buy a car. if she says ur selfish then say all the times in the past years u have driven her.|`|NNmDDo39aa	i think your parents are using you no offence. like seriously my bfs dad always pulls bs like that oh can you take me here and blah blah blah.. dont waiste your time on unnecesary thiings, if they need to go to the store for milk persay thats okay but when its the beer store and stuff its not worth your time. hun look for a job for yourself and get out of there dont put yourself in a bad position, its your life do what you want!!!! its not your responcibility to stay home and babysit them and take them wherever!|`|AA12032374	sounds like your Mom needs to grow up. You need to move on with your life and NOT let anyone take away your dream of school to better your life. If your Mom and Step Dad are spening all their $ on crap, let them do it, just move on|`|vLiKVSrmaa	Personally I think that your mom is taking advantage of your car,you and your money. She is also jealous of your boy-friend. DONT TAKE HER SIDE!!!|`|553XVYwUaa	i think you should give her theses things    a bike (for transpotation)    nicorette (for the cigarettes)    a slap in the face (to get her thinking write)        and then leave and say i gave you enough if you cant live with it   then be homeless|`|bzmPe6Dvaa	I would first get a bunch of applications for your mom and step dad and tell them you are not being selfish by trying to help them out and if they dont want the job apps or they arent trying to get a job or making any effort then say no you dont have to put up with your mother and step dad by the way it sounds it is pure lazyness you are an adult you can go your own places for yourself  and that guy down there  that said moms side def. is a fuckin retard  but anyways getting back to the point show them job websites and such and if you see an improvement limit the places you take them and only for NECESSITIES like TOILET PAPER ya know what i mean thats what i would do in your situation and your in college right now you shouldnt have to start your career yet just because your mother.    if she does not get a job then I would reccomend moving in with a friend or something untill she gets her head straight.|`|5GKOtJwjaa	moms side def|`|DR2gal9Kaa	Just think of it as this put your self in her place and tell her how you feel and that she can"t just ask for a ride for little things because it is your car! GOOD LUCK!|`|mSZfjgalaa	k i have a sister to who has a boyfriend that is controlling and he is you should break up with him my sis is getting into a lot of fights with him and they almost broke up if your family doesnt like a boyfriend they should be gone and you can always find another guy you have always had your eye on|`|XruykwlXaa	The way I see it, at age 19, and going to school only two days per week, YOU should have a job and YOU should be helping with the rent.  You complain that your Mom cannot pay the rent, but then you live there, too.  You are not paying for it either.  I understand that you don't want them to drive your car, but since you are not helping out, and you don't work, you should make some kind of contribution, and perhaps taking her around IS that contribution.  Get a job, gal and an apt. of your own.|`|7Dd8CVf3aa	Ignore your mother, you do have your own life you know!  And it's her problem if she doesn't have any money  I know you love her and whatever but seriously, it doesn't  sound like she takes care of you very well.  So ya, just tell her your not driver her anywhere and and that you have your own life, and that you are NOT selfish.  That is what i would do.|`|p1rgcnjgaa	Your boyfriend's not controlling you, you're in love. Your mom's the one controlling you. Tell her that! She shouldn't treat you like that; you've done nothing wrong and she'd taking advantage of you big time. Yes, family's supposed to take care of each other, but it doesn't mean serving them. Also, it was her own fault for not being able to take care of her own finances.|`|q1HOCko8aa	you should just try to get a pt job and get your own place.  you should still try to help your family out too. but i just think that situation is just too stressful.. and your mom isnt listening to you so..; i would think that would be a better option.
94464c65a3cf331abd994f1207860d7eaa	Because I have moral convictions - cheating IS wrong, and no matter who presented themselves to me, I have too much love for my boyfriend and too much respect for myself to lower myself like that. Willpower isn't an impossible thing - if you've got any measure of strength of character, you shouldn't have a problem saying no. In fact, straying should simply never cross your mind in any seriousness, no matter how cute he or she may be.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Because i love my husband more then anything and he is my whole life plus i'm not a sl*t and i respect my husband,my vows and myself to much to do something so terrible like that.    My husband has always been a very sweet and wonderful man who treats me like a queen and i would be a fool to hurt him and ruin what we have together.    Ewww brad pitt lol.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	Cheating is nothing more than a selfish personality trait. People that cheat don't cheat because of the sex, they cheat because they are selfish and don't care who they hurt with their actions. I wouldn't cheat because I know it's wrong and I wouldn't want my boyfriend cheating on me. It's all about character. My answer is NO.|`|IvMPh09baa	i never have said it for certain.      would it be cheating if my husband already knew and approved of me and brad pitt hooking up???|`|uNehLjVDaa	well i wouldnt cheat id just ask my partner to join in...|`|EPaYoJaiaa	because I've been in a situation before where I could have cheated but didn't. I was able to control myself.|`|cFrtOg45aa	Well, I wouldn't because people say my husband looks like Brad Pitt. So why cheat on that. My husband has the whole package. Looks, intelligence, money, sex appeal, and he knows how to please me in every way. So I have no need to cheat with some average looking sleaze ball.|`|veZLfnGFaa	That's a good question.  But if you're in love with someone and there is trust, that someone could be your Brad Pitt.  ;)|`|e276df96c55a338c1e69a8869d0cd199aa	Because I know I wouldn't.  I've had opportunity to cheat, I didn't take it.  I don't care who walks through the door, I love my husband.   And besides, Brad Pitt isn't all that.|`|00rOVdeTaa	I love my husband so very much and no one is worth giving up my happiness, "Brad Pitt" only one time, my husband is a life time of happiness.|`|AZxJfST5aa	I would cheat on my bf with Brad Pitt. I wouldn't expcect him to say no to Angelina either :)|`|MhvwRwNKaa	I dont think Brad pitt is hot. And i can actually say i would never do that because it has been done to me too many times. So I know how that feels.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Well you always hope that you wouldn't do something like that. The best thing to do, is to make sure you never let yourself get into that situation. If Brad Pitt were to be walking towards me, I would walk away very fast. (cause I probably couldn't control myself)|`|7cjqT33Baa	For one, I'm one of the rare that just don't find Brad Pitt attractive.  I like my men with a little more flaw to them.    I don't think anyone can ever be certain 100% that they'd never cheat or that their spouse never would.  But I'm at a place in my marriage (of 15 years) that I just can't imagine a scenario of that happening.  My husband and I make each other happy, we have a lot of fun and adventure.  I wouldn't want to risk losing that for a few hours of thrill, even if that person could make my toes curl.  The only person I want curling my toes is my husband. There isn't anything anyone else can give me that tops what I have with him.  I am confident he feels the same way.  We just fit together well.|`|DjircW6waa	I think the temptation to cheat has more to do with what's already broken in your relationship than having some irresistable situation present itself.  You're not interested in Brad Pitt if you already have someone who makes you feel like Angelina Jolie.  However, I agree with you.  People who make statements like "I would never..." are setting themselves up for failure.|`|IhUEzjjYaa	If you really truly love the one you're with, you wont cheat because you could never imagine your life with out that person.|`|j6pqXCh9aa	Its a question of who you are and how much you love the person that you have committed yourself to.|`|rDmMk9Soaa	I know for sure that I would. If Pierce Brosnan threw himself at me, I would have to give in. But realistically, I am fortunate enough to have a partner I can talk to and he doesn't freak out about things. The problem with cheating is the betrayal. We are open and honest with our feelings.|`|k4mGOlwsaa	My husband completely satisfies me and some of us value our marriage and actually are in love with the person were married too! people have choices! if your marriage is bad either do something about it or get out of the marriage cheating shouldn't even be an option
oCG2JxsEaa	looks like that is all he wants nothing more. so i wouldn't unless you go out with him again and for a longish time before you do just to make sure that he likes you and doesn't just want to f*** you. sorry to be kinda harsh but i think you should be careful bout this. hope this helps!|`|xNkmK0SHaa	He is an EX !!!    If you kids couldn't sustain a long term, committed. exclusive, and loving relationship such a short time ago, you won't be able to do it now.  If you are only interested in having sexual intercourse with him, there is something seriously sick in you.    The fact that you "don't see anything wrong with it" does not mean it is a good or even an acceptable thing to do.    I think you should have a real and open talk about your feelings and activities with an adult female, preferably one who isn't and wasn't a slut at any time.    You are already in serious trouble and are headed for disaster.  Wake up. Grow up. And develop some self respect.|`|loG7TrLMaa	do you really, REALLY need advice here?|`|0zgolkhOaa	booty call?|`|81gHbOjBaa	I think people should't have sex just for the pleasure of it.  But then again people in this world nowadays are just extremely flawed so it's entirely up to you.|`|RzeYy8dTaa	Get some values .why is sex the important issue here?So you can have a boyfriend?  Don't be a fool one more time! Having a boyfriend is to get to know a person and learn from them things you like or don't like.If you have different goals and values ,you move on.Use what you learned to make better choices.You are being used and getting pretty screwed up.Do you think it is you job to provide sex and he will come for more?Wake up and get some class or every sleazy dirt bag will treat you the same.And when their finished you will be called a slut and no good guy will want you.Get to know some quality people and get some self respect.|`|7AFLaiYjaa	WRONG x123364976556|`|2imXzBHbaa	get some|`|fTxwKBNBaa	Well it depends.  Sometimes it is ok but I think in your case the sex will turn into love after a while once more and you'll find yourself in your former relationship so you should as yourself if it is ok with you or not?|`|4AAVCLybaa	well ... there's nothing too wrong with it.  but don't think sex means a relationship.  sex = lust = may not mean being emotionally attached as well.  also, don't get into it with only one of you expecting to be together in an actual relationship. it won't end well.|`|76835e9a544163134ce35716229cd8f0aa	it's your body as lonq as you feel this is what you want to do, && you feel you wont have any regrets in the future about it than go ahead have a blast =)        try nha to expect anythinq after you have sex though as in a relationship...unless you both have brought it up|`|H4VFi6HGaa	just do it..it dont make u a bad person to have fun in ur life. just be safe about it. i lost mine wen i was 15, im 17 now and my ex and i do it all the time. for support..|`|20ZSqeBKaa	You do what you feel is right but don't do it because he wants to. If you feels comfortable doing with him again go ahead and get your freak on. Use protection.|`|x7iQb0r3aa	Two things..    a) There is a reason why is he is ex. If there was no reason for him to be a ex then you would still be together but you are not.    b) If you are having "feelings for each other" then why not get back together.    Sorry think you are getting played.|`|F5ZG2f0Uaa	Wellllll..  it depends on if you think that you can do it without getting reattached.   if you feel like you will become emotionally connected with him again then DONT DO IT. and honestly .... it's probably going to happen.   but i dont know you and only you can figure out if you can   have sex with him just for "fun" .......just dont let him use you girl.     i've done it before, it ended very badly.   my heart was broken :-/ even though i'm the one  that broke up with him before, and he begged for me back for   months. when we saw eachother at the beach and hooked up,   then he said he couldnt be with me bc of trust, i was DESTROYED    dont let something similar happen to you
zdu3gh8jaa	Good on them if they do! Loving someone deeply and wanting to share that love does not lessen with age. I wish them both a continued happy and active life. Many happy returns to your Grandad.|`|OUmOyjNtaa	It depends. . .  Are they as perverted as their grandchild?|`|AafsysNqaa	I think they won't do that, at night they would probably just kiss each other then go to sleep. I mean that would be gross, two old people having...i can't even imagine that, so wrong.|`|mG8kWrTXaa	Why not- if they still love each other, what's the problem?|`|ClK9W8THaa	I'm not sure if that's a nice question to ask or if that's a mean question to ask...But i do know , that is nobody's business.  I wish them well and God bless them
RQD7Z0eXaa	Call her.  If she doesn't wanna talk, that's her problem.  But I'm sure she has been wanting to talk to you also, so call her.  What's the worst that could happen???|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Not at all, you should call her and see what's up in her life.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No it would not be.|`|3LIW9PhNaa	IT WOULD BE TOTALLY FINE TO CALL HER IN MY OPINION       O SORRY LEFT THE CAPS ON AND DON'T WANT TO ERAS SORRY|`|LYVDtbFZaa	Absolutely not. I had a friend that moved away in 4rd grade and i hadn't even seen or talked to her in years. when I finally got her phone number (in middle school) I picked up the phone and called and she was really really happy and that allowed us to start talking again. Good Luck!
vdM9AJDtaa	A PAINTING SET, SOME CANVAS AND PAINTS, OR A NICE DIARY OR TICKETS TO A SHOW OR OPERA OR BAND,   A MAKE OVER / NAILS VOUCHER|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	How about a trip to a Spa?|`|fTYFN5MUaa	sewing kit  garden stuff  a cat    i dunno try those|`|velIdcbNaa	Take her to a nice dinner.  just the two of you.  Get her some nice flowers.  If you live by the beach and it's nice outside go for a moonlit stroll.  If she is vibrant go dancing!  Or you could cook a nice candle lit meal.  Some soft music, the works!
2fG6NpUkaa	ew i hate girls like that i do i do i do. they bug me hahahahah. well ya she is. Alot of girls do that just to show off that they got something that you want or did want.     what a eewy girl.|`|aB0TlLEgaa	she's a lesbian lol not really idk she could be or idk haha|`|SKDqypJNaa	Sounds like this girl is a hater because your probably a lot prettier then her. Reminds me of when I was in high school. All the girls hated on me.|`|teNUDFtGaa	prob....ew when she stares at you flick her off LOL|`|ZVNtxUKTaa	I think you two would make good friends. =)|`|W6uHaI1kaa	If she is going out with the guy that you like just because you like him then tell her to leave you alone, and ya i kinda do think so
TPJQAfZVaa	I don't think any number of kids is too many, as long as you can financially support them and give equal love and care to all of them.|`|EFXT4rj2aa	well you never know. i dont have kids but i love them. when i get married im guna have as many as god wants me to i would like 4 or more. but ill be happy with whatever i get|`|13ea383a561ea3da78008d577b51bc63aa	i have one boy and one girl and that is enough for me.  I don't know that there is a magic  , as long as the parents can provide for them and not liver off the government!|`|MGTnkGnWaa	Three is enough for me. Four is enough to keep the house running at 100 mph.|`|050d625de676773088de1e0e4f88ccfaaa	I dont have kids but i believe that those who do want kids have a certain number that they want. I want 2 and three at the most. The first one i want a girl. Even if i only have 1 child i would be happy but i would still want my child to have a sibling to play with.|`|y4LpyzGvaa	for me i think 2 is enough...    and three is much, but still it is a blessing from God..
50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	it is not my place to punosh it is the law   but I certainly would not help him get away with it|`|Ov6TGigsaa	Uh...I'm not a parent but I know punishing wouldn't help.  If he feels guilty about it, leave him alone, the guilt's enough punishment.  If he's not and you think that he might even do it again...  Well. I'd suggest going to the police but that might be harsh for a parent to do.  Idk.  The consequences will catch up to him.
NLxcfGplaa	Yeah your young but you know it, your not out trying to get a boyfriend like the other girls here.  Maybe you should give him a chance but remember you are young.   You must be brave to go up to him and ask him why are u staring at me? :)  Good luck|`|oCG2JxsEaa	i say go for it!|`|Fi8AIi4baa	I don't see why not, if you like him.|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	Too cute go for it and have fun,lol.|`|rEVgk9uxaa	Yes you are way too young... just keep it innocent, hold hands, go to movies with friends... stay around groups of people together.. time alone is to risky!! Look after yourself, you have your whole life ahead of you! And many boys to mess around with when you're older!|`|rh12tX8Naa	I think that you're too young to start dating. I'm dreading my kid being that age and think about dating. If you do, don't rush anything. you have your whole life ahead of you.|`|g6KubppDaa	If U like him, and he likes U, then what the heck are U to doing being single?? Try
7PGxqRfZaa	I don't know what you do, so i can't tell you about that. But i can tell you that women to most real men are the most beautiful of god's creations. they normally smell good,look good,act sweet. and you all have what ever guy out there wants. I think you know what i'm talking about. Well hope this helped. Good luck|`|GjsrcsZkaa	They act like girls, They walk sexy, they talk sexy, and dress sexy  ......What not to do never stop being sexy
i6WVPncnaa	Ask your drama friends, if you can sit with them.  You should not sit with people that don't like you.  Just tell your friend that hangs out with the jack @sses that you want to continue being friends with him and that you wanted to sit with the drama club people.  Continue talking to the friend even when your friends with the drama people.  Good luck.
Msu6RB1Qaa	I don't know where you live, but you can build a good case and win custody.  Document your care of the child.  Who cares for her when she is sick, who makes sure she is bathed and clothed. Who takes her to the physician's office. Get Documentation about the church visits.   Show that you have the finances to support her. The court's job is to make the best decision for the child.  You have to show the court that you are the best choice. You will need a plan of action for her care while you are at work. It helps to have a local support group, like your mother or a sister. Show that she will grow up with a female Identity around.  It will help if your employer, gives a statement they will be supportive of you  having a sudden absence from work in a medical emergency of the child.   Father's are winning custody more and more often. My nephew won last year. My son won about five years ago. And I know others.|`|ubDQTBudaa	Before you fail a divorce you should think about your little girl ....

EzpEyVnraa	Tell him asap, before it drags on too long. He's just too shy as he's laid his feelings out with no reply. Send him a text in reply saying you like him too.|`|4AAVCLybaa	you should bring it up while you still have the chance.  what is ignoring what is destined to be something great going to do? (:|`|adL8Qm7yaa	the guy should always be the one to ask the girl out. and a text is kinda... yea....  the other way around and the relationship will not work out.  but again, seriously i wuldnt go out with a best friend
009Fbd1caa	I think you should definately ask her out..the giggling is a definate possitive sign, girls giggle uncontrollably usually when they like someone its involuntary, just happens. See a movie, just chill out round yours and watch a film.    Its all down to you to make the first move.  Good luck :) x|`|7wInwqkAaa	just call her or text her and you never know id she feels the same way so just take it slow. id start with the first date on saturday and then ask her|`|fS3zUnTcaa	ok u need to find her before someone else asks her out to the v-day dance! After u ask her to the dance then u can ask for a small date this Saturday, but your  priority should be the dance!|`|wbg15fYjaa	hit her up right now and ask her to meet ya somewhere like this weekend but the sooner the better ummmm........... you might not wanna come across to desperate like you are right now chances are if you do that its gonna go down hill from there. Also keep people on a waiting list just in case she bails on you. Lord knows how many times that has happend to dorks that come across desperate not trying to call you a dork or anything|`|eOcB34lraa	Be cool dude!! If she likes you, she will continue to like you.  If she don't then it may take sometime to get her to have feeling s for you, but either way just be cool! You need to have some convo with her.  Text always works! Ask her to hang out...see what happens...y never kno;)|`|PgKd36Inaa	no wait until the first date because u dont want to push her to much take her on a date and then the first time u see her (if the date goes well) ask her:D|`|1afDi8K5aa	ask her to hang out with u it seems like she like u 2 ;)|`|WlTlYMJxaa	oh you should play the whole secret admirer meet me at the dance thing    heres what you should do if you have the moola  buy some flowers and some chocolates and get her a card  inside the card put  "i'll be waiting for you by so and so at the valentines day dance.. if you show up ... i just need you to answer one question.. will you be mine for valentines day"    something like that i dont know    thats really romatic and exiciting  cause she'll be all giggle about trying to figure out who it is and what not  and if she likes you like you say she does  hopefully she will hope that that person is you when she shows up to the dance :)|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	call her|`|i7rYRvlTaa	text her?|`|E3t5BcZgaa	ask her to that dance and give her a red flower or chocolates really gets us charmed|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	Girls like a confident guy and MOST girls are too afraid to ask a guy out, My advice to you is that you just straight out ask her, don't let yourself not or you'll regret it. Do it fast or she'll lose interest or think that you lost interest and move on! Do it quick, Valentines day is almost here!|`|4IYKRhxIaa	if you find her, ask her to the dance. if she ends up saying no because she doesn't want to (which is EXTREMELY unlikely), than continue being her friend and ask her out later. if she says no because she already has a date, then ask her out for saturday. Don't expect that the guy that she is going to the dance with is her boyfriend or even potential boyfriend. she's almost forsure into you because of the giggling and stuff. i really hope this helped and i wish you luck with her!|`|MfUMaKcDaa	just call her up|`|3frIC80naa	yes take her on a date on saturday and then ask her to the dance there and to be your girl.|`|X8X2gHszaa	You should Call her and ask her if she wants to go with you.  If she likes you back, she will say yes.   Don't worry, it seems she likes you anyways.
5WP9rLTlaa	I will be! I have a choice between using a British, Australian or New Zealand sixpence.  My mother has the Australian and New Zealand coins and some fool gave my fiance the British one as a five cent coin (it's really old and worth way more than five cents!)  After the wedding I will be drilling a hole in the coin and using it as a pendant on a necklace.  The superstition is that the sixpence is to ensure financial good fortune for those that didn't know about it.|`|jPJ9MTCwaa	I am not because I am wearing flip flops....although it would be wonderful to have money flying from my shoes when I was walking.  :-)|`|SRK8pJ0Qaa	hmmm i had never heard of that before either. i think i will do it. but my shoes will most likely be open toed. what would you do in that circumstance? and i like the idea of drilling a hole in it afterwards. very cute|`|RwXEMy0maa	I used to collect old coins when I was younger and I remembered having a single sixpence. When I checked a couple of months ago if I still had it, I couldn't find it where I thought it was! I was actually gutted because I had my heart set on using that one because I had had it for years and years.     Then about 2 weeks ago, I was having my room re-decorated, and I actually found it in a totally different place all on it's own, like I had 'put it somewhere safe' :P Lol.    I will definitely be including it in my wedding 'ritual', cos there is no point doing the first four for good luck and then missing the last part out!!!     But I think it will be pretty uncomfortable in my shoe, and I am not set on what type of shoe I want to wear yet. I have heard though, that a lot of women are getting one sewn into the seam of the wedding dress, so I think I will probably do that instead :)|`|ECe1rgsdaa	I have heard of it but I can't because I am wearing sandals so It won't stay. Not that I would be able to get my hands on a sixpence...|`|5DB6nOXkaa	I think I'm going to get an Irish (my heritage) sixpence. don't forget in goes in the left shoe!|`|0Id85yiYaa	never heard of having sixpence in your shoe.|`|yhgRaBPXaa	I had never heard of that til the wedding day so I didnt do it. Maybe I should have for luck, cause I had an accident on the honeymoon and spent 5 days in a Mexican hospital!
43a0f96cedfd8467fd9c43ea79d0f06daa	Hi Pippy ive been where you are now and its the worst feeling ever, not once have you said he was sorry for hurting you, it sounds like you will not get any closure and until you do you will take very long time to heal.  You can take him back if you like, well until the next time? and if you do your going to feel the same in 6 months, the closure needs to come from you.  You can take something good from everything and the good i took was not to do it to my partner because i know how it feels and to this is good because i can never be tempted.  My partner has put on a little bit of weight since having our child (so what) i still love and respect her the same as before, its nothing to do with(she is thinner and prettier than me) it was the grass looked greener simple as.  One more thing make sure before he moves everything out keep one of his payslips you will need it for the sca (his national insurance number)  wishing you the best of luck|`|vztEwvT8aa	You don't get over it...it'd never be the same again.....    My advice for what it's worth is...don't get even with them, just move on. Nothing makes them regret it more than their ex happy without them|`|NQwljNOoaa	You need to sit down and have a serious talk with him.  Ask him straight out if that girl wouldn't have broken up with him if he would have picked her over you.  Tell him that you need him to be honest.  You will know if he is being honest.  You have to be prepared for either answer.  If the answer is that he would have went with her if she would have allowed him in her life, then you need to move on because he is telling you that you are not his first choice and you deserve better.  If he tells you that he truly wants you and that you are his number one person, then you could start by forgiving him, but make it known that you will not tolerate another stunt like that.  Tell him that you would rather part now than have him resent you down the line.  You both need to be totally honest about how you feel.  There is life after an affair.  You just need to figure out his stand before you can move on.  If you believe him, then you won't have to feel second best because he will fall all over himself to show that you are his number one.|`|XkR2nRGGaa	Its all on you personally i dont think you all women have to feel obligated to stay with the dirty percentage of us mens i think you should move on and find a better one of us cuz there are many ^_^ but in the end its all on you
009Fbd1caa	Ok, so you have some feelings for both boys, you just need to hang out with the both of them and see which one your more attracted t, personal qualities etc. If you don't want to hang straight away, bit shy, then just talk over instant messenger, or text. One of them will be right for you.  Good luck :) x
faT4MyVkaa	Lingerie is for females. We can't get it off you fast enough.|`|4mkKoYn6aa	i will say this the best way i can      my woman makes me sweat when ever she around because of how hot she is. to say the truth i wish my woman did give me the grace of wearing lingerie and letting me see it ouch!!!       if the question is "Are you still turned on by strip-teases and lap dances done by your wife?" i wish, if she ever did do that she would have not taken off anything but her shirt and i would prob be already hurting i would enjoy it beyond all explanation     i love my woman any way they are|`|lQouIoCraa	hell no!  turn off the light!!|`|RsjTbp8Oaa	I am a size 14 bottom, size 16 top and tall...a little rough around the edges due to ag and baby but i let it all hang out and if he on't like it he can go get him another woman because there wold be another man out there for me.|`|4Vmlf902aa	I'm not married. My mom and dad are, and mom is a bit on the chubby side. I really don't want to know if my dad likes to see her in lingerie, or would I want to ask cause it would be AWKWARD!!!|`|5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	I'm not a guy, but I'm a BBW who has a BF who loves my extra.  I'm not huge, but I'm not a small girl either (size 18, but I'm pregnant right now)...anyway, he loves seeing me in lingerie (tasteful variety) and we have a great sex life. . . sorry if that's TMI|`|z7BTeUKvaa	What is BBW?  I'm sure your hubby would love to see you in lingerie.  But why don't you ask him?|`|tuKY5Q7Waa	Keep in mind that 50years ago or so (and a bit longer than that), the image of beauty was a "chubby" female, so some people might still have that as their definition of beauty.    To each man his taste, and if he likes chubbiness, then he will most likely be turned on.
VmSKQ40Caa	Way too many questions like this from teen females. Anyway, your boyfriend was just looking out for you, the girl is not your friend.|`|vGHExDOzaa	If your bff can't except him ask her why and if it is valid split your time together with them if she doesn't then tell her that she needs to except it more then likely she doing it because she is protecting you and the boyfriend can deal with what ever happens my bfs either except my friends or forget about me|`|iZx787ntaa	I think you're boyfriend and bestfriend need to make peace just for you.  they need to put aside their differences and keep their opinions to themselves  Your boyfriend shouldnt have shouted at her for that kind of remark  but your best friend cant expect u to choose between the both of them  you need to talk to her about it  maybe shes just worried that you will stray from her and be with your boyfriend all the time, afraid of losing u  but by doing what she is doing, shes pushing you away without realising.  You should only do things that you feel is right  Dont finish your boyfriend just becoz of your best friend  But dont befriend her because your boyfriend dislikes her  if they are true to you they will find a way to do that.  u need to sit them both down and have a talk really  sort things out instead of letting them get out of hand  just assure yor friend that you wont ditch her for your boyfriend  and tell your boyfriend that he cant just shout at your friends because he feels like it otherwise he will lose u again.  hope this helps x
i6WVPncnaa	I thought you were a girl.  Sorry.  No, you need to talk to your friend and tell him that since his been with his girlfriend, he has changed.  You two have been fighting because of her.  Her girlfriend is driving you two apart.  Ask him to go on a guys night out, that you need it. I sometimes don't like it when my man hangs out with his guy friends because I feel left out.  You should go on a double date, and try to know the girlfriend a little better.  Tell your guy friend that your trying to be her friend, since that is his girlfriend.  Hope this helps.  Good luck.
AA11146445	Try talking to your friend about why shes been in such a "crabby" mood towards you and belittleing you,if she reacts in a repulsive way or says that shes sorry and continues then i suggest you end the friendship.You don't deserve to be treated rudely especially if you didn't do anything to accept such a rude manner.     Your friend is probably just jealous of you and wants to hurt you.  Trust me girls are very vicious :)    but dont let her get you down it just means shes not worth  being a part of your life if she treats you like that    you deserve a better friend    good luck sweetie|`|cb5WcNHsaa	she probably heard a rumor|`|crnjv96Faa	be serious to her. talk to her and also ask other people what'  she might think that you did
Kus73aMQaa	I'm sure deep down if did affect her. However probably not as much if she was asleep and didn't realize what was going on. She may still hang out with him because she doesn't remember much of it. Even for 30 seconds it was rape because she wasn't able to say no.    I wouldn't worry much about him doing it again. If he's been alone with her after the even and hasn't tried it again he may never do it again. She is old enough now to fight back if he did.|`|AA11670981	Don't try to get too involved in this if she doesn't have a problem with what happened, you may not know the whole truth; BUT this guy can never be left alone with ANY females around again!!!|`|AA10063292	To tell you the truth maybe it didn't happen. She could just be caught up in a hudge lie. Or she just doesnt want to cry and morn about it. EVERY person is different in situations like that. But i think her parents should do something.|`|8qQ2vHscaa	maybe it hasn't really hit her that she got raped.  the cousin's a pervert, and she probably doesn't want to be mad at her own blood relative.|`|LZYpkR9zaa	chill out...if she's not affected/doesn't care cuz it happened a while ago..then why are you complaining...plus i woldn't even call that rape...he barely did anything with for that 30sec....grow up|`|xthjbUg2aa	i wish i could sleep with my cousin LOL|`|Ke9JcsVQaa	You need to tell someone and she is probally really scared and you need to get both of them off the streets!|`|ErvhPYlbaa	He "put it in her and she didn't notice?"    Was she a virgin??  If she was, I'd say you're missing a piece of the puzzle.  I'd think the pain would have awakened her.    And if it IS the truth, then he DID exactly rape her.  Some states consider penetration of ANY object or body part to be rape, but in this case, every state would consider it rape.    That is messed up and disgusting.|`|wlfFqSp8aa	just be on the watch out and stay away from hi.|`|bYU77eteaa	It probably affected her...she was probably like me though...Blocking it out and acting like nothing happened.  Its a defense mechanism to keep from breaking down.  from my personal experience and opinion...let it go unless you see changes in her after the incident.  If she is acting ok then let her act ok.  I didn't let anyone know about my incident and if I did I wouldn't have wanted people acting FOR me when I was trying to forget about it.  Older now, Its easier for me to talk about it and get it out of my system|`|NOKScSJqaa	ok, let's do this, why don't u mind your own business and stay out of other people lives... need any tips? try getting a life of your own ;)|`|IUZlmeMXaa	Now this is very surreal...I actually can't say that she really doesn't care because she already knew that she was going to have to go through the same thing when she gets older. I'm not saying that she actually wanted it to happen but i think that she really doesn't have a care in the world. Now if her mom didn't say anything about it happening and her cousin still comes around then there is nothing to really worry about. But if he strikes again now that she has her period than she should report it to her parents immediately. Thats really all i can say!|`|5vgnrvcmaa	Unfortunately, you cannot save people from themselves.    You're a good friend, but it's their family.|`|Ikd9cppcaa	I think you should just be quiet about this. It sounds as if it may be a story and it just got out of hand. It's very odd that she didn't care and that cousin who supposedly raped her still comes to her house. Maybe your friend has a creative mind. Just don't bring it up again because from what you have said, I'm not so sure it ever happened.|`|3y0w1qIBaa	Call the police if he attempts to do it again.|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	Wow, thats really sad. Idk maybe if shes in the bathroom while your at her house, try talking to her mom about how worried you are. Or talk to your mom, and maybe your mom can call her mom|`|t4F59gf2aa	Do you know what rape means?  Noone "puts it in for 30 seconds when you are asleep".|`|vwcDdNfcaa	1 30 seconds is still rape    2 people arnt always like omg end of the world!!   3 im so confused at the end  he still comes there to chill or rape her?  and who cares if he is on her period..  thats good it means she is not prego.|`|LlMS9NsSaa	To each their own, maybe she liked it.|`|vGHExDOzaa	Your friend is affect but doesn't know how to show it and the family might think it is a rumor and by the way nasty question the cousin should be in juvi|`|BWPtZkIDaa	omigawd!!! talk 2 her!!  tell her 2 b especially careful  btw how did she find out if she was sleeping?|`|tae4IGumaa	then she probably will get pregnant..by her cousin...gross..|`|k2wiYJAcaa	you say strikes again like he was a villian off of a movie. I think my first question is why didnt your friends mother do anything. that is insane!      and that is still rape... any sexual activity not permitted/wanted/whatveer is rape... no matter how long or what sort..      If it were to happen again, tell your schools counselor, thats wrong..
QAJRBPtIaa	I LOVE YOU!!  Everyone says i'm so weird for being a white girl who loves asian guys!    so since this beautiful couple is getting married, i can rub that in their faces!    And I think an asian restaurant would be lovely, it'll be great food and you won't have to have anything catered to a hotel!  An exotic, relaxed atmosphere is always a plus!    Hope I helped!|`|TiIzwLUIaa	i would do a Verity  of the cultures this way there s Little of all kinds of food wise as for were to have it go with what ever on you can afford i would go with the hotel ballroom this way if you guests are to drunk etc .. they can at least get a room|`|7CKipTZOaa	I'd go with the restaurant, unique and probably much easier to decorate! They can probably help you out with decor they already have and guests would be sure to talk about it in a good way, plus if the food is good theres another perk!|`|kD6M3Banaa	A ballroom sounds better than a restaurant. Thank God you married an asian.|`|QictQpZzaa	vietnam|`|5k2GI5ZYaa	wherever the two of you decide upon|`|7ffac99818927d0dc47fc3e466ffdd95aa	I'd go with a large Asian restaurant. The food is much better and the arrangements are more affordable. Shark fin soup anybody ?    In a hotel ballroom, you have to rent the space, hire catering and decorate.     In this tough economy, you have to save some $$ for your honeymoon and pay mortgage on a new house.|`|NBXY35zPaa	Your wedding sounds like one of my family reunions! haha Well for one, I don't recommend doing it at some Asian restaurant, a lot of Asian people do that so it's almost cliche... but it's your wedding so do it somewhere you and your guests will enjoy. The ballroom sounds like a good idea, go with that. Congratulations by the way... you'll have interesting times with the new multicultural family!|`|2exfa5hWaa	congratulation|`|b91d5a63816ce3a9cce952ee2d7b3cf6aa	I say go for what is more economical. This is not a good time to be too lavished.|`|Fw2yHgrOaa	Bless you. lol I'm an asian woman and I think it's sweet when asian guys fall in love with white women (so long as it's true love and neither side is golddigging).     Why not have your wedding at whichever one is more convenient or cheaper and just mix it up with the food and decorations?|`|wMWfCjBpaa	Congrats! I'm vietnamese and boy are there so many rules that older folks have. If you don't care, like my fiance and I, do what you'd like. I grew up with mostly white and hispanics and thought I'd marry one. But nope, I moved to Houston and found my with a vietnamese guy instead.    We're having our's at a chinese restaurant. It's more affordable and the food is better. I personally never enjoyed catered or hotel food. The quality isn't that great, and if you do find a good place, it's expensive. We're spending a little under $400 per table with ten people, including tax and tip. We're serving 8 courses to 400 guests. To make it look nice, we hired a decorator to create a romantic look.     In Houston, a nice hotel ballroom will run you about $9K for just the venue, no food. If you get food through them, then you get a discount. It's still an arm and a leg.    I debated over the idea for months and I'm glad I went with this decision. Enjoy your envelopes! It's a vietnamese tradition to only give cash as a wedding gift, min $50 per person. Close friends and family give way more. This will help you two start your future together.    Congrats!|`|0Id85yiYaa	i've never heard of a wedding being in a chinese restaurant. i would go with the ballroom
AA12316366	yes gio ahead and talk to her maybe she is annoyed and a bit jealous and feels this other person is stealing your affection|`|OtvAUGv1aa	This may sound rude, but you sound like you're in middle school. If the friendship is important, pick up the damn phone and talk to her. If you could honestly care less and you don't want this girl in your life, then at least have the common decency to talk with her - please note, half of "talking" is "listening". You may wind up hearing what she has to say and changing your mind on disregarding her friendship. Whatever you do, don't burn bridges and always make sure there is closure.|`|vsbSTSINaa	FOR GODS SAKE, PLEASE TALK TO HER! nothing is more important to her than your friendship... and at the time, she really needs someone like you to goof off with and be super cool jedi's (MAY THE FORCE BE WITH YOU!) lol.... please talk to her. Youll be happy that you did
b6ccac7a047169fde765030620090cc2aa	yea trust me...especially the next day and especially if you guys were friends..at first it will be akward but after you guys start talking everything should hopefully b back to normal...but dont worry its normal it was for me..lol well good luck =)|`|uQfHHOW8aa	yea sometimes it is, if it was like a random hook-up at a party or something.  sometimes they just feel akward seeing the person again
AA10982164	Please, don't go back to that guy! My daughter was in that situation twice! She worked very hard to take care of herself, her  daughter, and her stepdaughter, as well as her husband, and even the friends her husband would bring over.    There was no consideration for her if she got sick, and her husband wouldn't even help her take care of their child!    He will not change. He is what he is! It is hard to take care of yourself and your children, but it is even harder when you are having to do it with dead weight around. He will not be satisfied with you. He is selfish and self centered. or he would have been glad the home and bills were being taken care of instead of upset that you weren't spending money on him.    Find the strength within yourself to be strong enough not to "work things out" with him. Believe me, I was married to a man who was emotionally and financially abusive, he promised me the moon if I would try to work things out, I went back, but within 2 weeks he was back to his habits. When I left, I ended up losing so much, but I got myself back. That last try cost me a lot, because he made sure that I didn't get even most of my personal things when I left.    Be smart, take care of yourself and your children. You sound very responsible. It will be hard now, but things will improve. I hope you have family that will help, but this man is a user, don't be his victim any longer.|`|tao83sDxaa	aren't you tired of being a door mat. he saw a good thing when he met you. there is no way you can get this man to grow up. he only knows how to take advantage of you. his behavior and verbal abuse is just what you will have for the rest of your life, it not going to get any better, this it.  i know you said you got sick and then preg, well try to get yourself feeling better and get a job. i'm sure your mom will help you with taking care of your child, don't forget you need to kick in at moms. he says your not good enough for him, i think it is the other way around. you need to get more confidence in yourself, and you will see that your life is better without him. go back to school or whatever it takes to get a better job. he is a user and thats all he will ever be, you need to set up your own household. you can do it. you would be surprised the energy you get when your not being torn down.you sound like a wonderful person, remember that.
E7LQp6VRaa	I think it's pretty and would go with either curls or straight...|`|MbmHripJaa	just as it is looks great.. i think curls might be too much|`|KZZovykVaa	no curls|`|OwhTe0VTaa	no curls  it looks perfect straight  curls would be to busy|`|mqpN7rXcaa	too simple add some curles|`|0Id85yiYaa	cute|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	I don't like it.|`|YgggHhwuaa	No curls- just as it is|`|cPIYUWxyaa	no curls....keep it straight|`|ScHW4842aa	curls are so nineties. go straight.
c0uwtsJ5aa	Well if you sit next to any in your classes, start talking to them, and asking them questions about your work. Heads up though most normal kids don't like popular/preppy kids, and your old friends might not like your new friends.... They might be alittle upset with you =(
NOKScSJqaa	well :D I'm 21 now, I'm the youngest and I am still annoying :p but in a lovely way :P I look out for my sister :D|`|NUvu9vMDaa	HECK YES AND NOTHING LESS! seriously mine are ALWAYS on my nerves! one time they read my diary and found out who my crush was and they rode their bikes around the neighborhood telling people who my crush was, and they told him! i cant go out in public without being laughed at, they ruined me...|`|J4gIGX56aa	yes, all of them are..mine drives me crazy! when im trying to watch t.v.  but i still love the kidd. =]
HAk6iROaaa	I am quite sure that a lot of men and women in arranged marriages would LOVe to get a divorce, but society frowns on it, so they stay together and that's how people think that all arranged marriages are happy ones, from the outside they look good, but on the inside they very seldom are. Divorce is a wonderful option for people who are in relationships that are just not good....It offers them a new life, I think divorce is a really sensible choice when incompatibility occurs and in arranged marriages this is the norm...|`|BBVfRheyaa	Not limited in India.    Females are more easy to get a job compared with old days.    They don't want to spend the day with damn husband.    Disillusionment.|`|AA10408380	Husbands want a traditional wife, who also works outside the home. While he stays the traditional husband, who doesn't work inside the home. When this happens, family is notified when problems arise, and often then not, the guys' parents take his side, and the girl's parents take her side. Then divorce happens, because there's a failure to understand the other side. You always want to fend for ur blood wheather right or wrong.|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	Intolerance !|`|5YFgZCEKaa	since women have educated they dont tolerate the indifference..  women have started to think and earn this has helped in liberation of women from the clutches of men
4SyYpBChaa	Hey, I used to be exactly like you,  I know it's really frustrating!.   I found it easy to just go for it,  If you act confident to others then they'll feel more at ease around you,  and then you 'll feel even more confident!  You've just gotta let go and say whatever,  Don't hold back, I spent years doing that.  You basically just have to force yourself into speaking to others and try not to make the conversation die,    When you're talking to people, (especially guys) try to pick an object of interest, so something you're both interested in or you know that person is interested in.  Keep the conversation going and try and act chilled and confident :)    Go For It!  If I can do it so can you!      x
DlAOGBz5aa	Of course it is, she isn't a friend, you can choose your friends but you can't choose your relatives, but you can cut them off, I did & I am much happier without them.|`|AA10822361	It is YOUR facebook and you accept or deny anyone you want.|`|qrGzsQWzaa	I think you did the right thing. Why would you accept someone on your facebook that you do not like?|`|QXLO2fzIaa	I don't think there is anything wrong with it. I think that it's your choice...if she's mad about it then oh well!|`|27cd00537a4c79f450c26015e47d2f6baa	I think you have the right to accept whoever you want to on Facebook, as long as you're tactful about it.  I love my aunts, but I really don't want them knowing all of my business on Facebook/Myspace.  Don't feel as though you should be obligated to accept her request, especially if she thinks that little of you.  You shouldn't have to explain anything either.  Your aunt is an adult, and will hopefully get over it.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	you know her better than we do..do what you think is right
b6ccac7a047169fde765030620090cc2aa	man i personally believe she is trying to tell you something..she is expecting you to make a move...if you want to be with her i suggest you start flirting with her..then hopefully it will lead to something else..well good luck =)
CBYFTjXHaa	the same happened to me except i don't think he was joking bout it.  but now we are friends again.    just randomly say something nice to her and you will start to talk again.|`|tz2lPcXGaa	Well it's gotta be mutual, so if she's not willing to forgive you then there's nothing you can do.     That said, you can at least try to talk to her. But you need to go into that conversation completely apologetic. It doesn't matter if you don't believe what you're saying, you need to just flat out say what you did was wrong and you're so sorry and you don't know what you were thinking. DO NOT start justifying yourself, explaining yourself, rationalizing things, or accusing her of things. Call yourself a jerk, an ***. Really the more you blame everything on yourself, the better chance you have of her forgiving you. You're going to want to avoid the blame and put it on her, but don't. If you really want to be friends again, then you'll blame yourself.     Also, I would restrain from talking about being friends again because she's not even going to consider that right away. Just hope she forgives you but be prepared for her to reject your apology. If she's not ready to forgive you yet, make sure you don't get mad, just really calmly say something to the extent of "okay well I'm really sorry again, let me know if you ever decide to forgive me."
PzBPo1WMaa	It's just that you were there by yourself and then they came along. No, you aren't being unfair. If they are bringing in anything to the house, they need to share. They obviously think you guys should. I can understand why you feel the way you do.|`|97oxJ0B8aa	She sounds like my beagle.  And I don't resent my beagle.  Maybe you wouldn't resent her if you just instead began thinking of her as some kind of sub-human animal/dog.|`|vHB9zUcCaa	i used 2 live temporarily w/ some 1 & i was told that anything that came in2 that house was shared w/ every 1. there were downs girls there, & the house parent's daughter knew good & well how they'd B effected if anything wasn't shared. however, there r simply times when u need 2 have yer own snax. in fact, 1 time a carload of snax were brought 2 me & i was allowed 2 keep them in my room & i wasn't required 2 share. there were other times I was able 2 sneak things in under cover. YES there's times 2 share & times not 2.      if u happen 2 have yer own fridge & yer own food & u have roomies u can put a lock on yer frige so yer food cannot B stolen. ANOTHER situation i saw is when a good frienda mine had nearby kids coming around & stealing pop from his fridge when they came in 2 use the bathroom. he got so sick of this he finally put a lock on the fridge. i don't reaqlly blame him.|`|0j18Wq6faa	Why not talk to your aunt about it? Maybe she does not want to eat all of the food for your family. It could be her way of helping out where she can. If it bothers you talk to her.|`|n53HeORBaa	food should be shared with everyone in the household regardless of who bought it but if your aunt is hoarding it big time then you should talk to your mom so she can talk this out with your aunt, you should try not to make a big issue with this since your aunt seems to be having a bad time right now so just talk this out to your mom if you are feeling uncomfortable about the situation|`|FHrQzaPqaa	did you tell your mother about that? that is not right for her and her   kids to be eating the food that your mother buys and you need to   bring that to your mother's attention.|`|cazm5qZbaa	I think if she is paying for the food in the basement fridge, it is hers, but if she freely takes food from the fridge upstairs that she did NOT pay for...then that is wrong. I say don't resent her, just openly discuss the situation|`|AA11761592	It does seem unfair. But does she pay for some of the food in your kitchen? If she pays for at least half of that, then she can have that extra as long as it isnt coming out of your mom's pocket.   On the ohter hand, if she doesnt pay for the any of the food in the kitchen fridge, then you need to ask her to pay half on the food in the kitchen.   But if nothing will change, forget about it! Let them rot their teeth and get fat and unhealthy. At least your eating well. Less junk food is best for you.
dzyJw0cvaa	It seems like it should be easy doesnt it??  but then when you get on top you realize the pleasure is in your hands and if you do it wrong it will be kinda embarrassing...I am still a little nervous about being on top.  I have to be in the right mood for it, but yes, the more you prectice with your bf the more it will get easy becasue you will elarn what he likes and what you should do.  its the same for guys.  they have to figure out what we like and it takes a few times.|`|T3BXC8qXaa	I feel confident on top, bottom or wherever I am. I don't remember practice being an issue...just always felt confident and comfortable.|`|KaF0nNFmaa	I used to be shy but now I feel confident.  Practice makes perfect!|`|y9CgveCGaa	From a guy:  If you guy loves you don't be shy.  He'll be fine with whatever you do.  I'm not a girl, but, it doesn't look that hard from the guys perspective and most of us aren't too particular.|`|U6nz8KaEaa	I usual get very shy about getting on top to be honest but after a couple of shots of Patron and Lime juice...ill be on top all night!!! Practice does make perfect and it does take alot of practice!!|`|lGSv138Paa	Let him move your hips. Watch his reactions to your movements to see what he likes best. And after that, practice makes perfect!!!!|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Of course I'm confident. I found after discovering the gym and building abs and muscles I had no clue I even had...Its alot better for him as well and he has requested it alot more than he use to.    YAY ME!|`|zNjACkxpaa	Big "o"s made me more confident, and dim lighting|`|AA11967247	no, i really dont. drinks make me more confident.|`|7F0zA7ARaa	yeah i feel confident. i know my husband loves me and my body so i have nothing to feel awkward about.|`|c1gnFE8Gaa	No I dont feel comfortable, Hubby seems to love it but I feel like I cant get the timing right lol,     I was very overweight for a long time but have lost it all now, he loves to see me on top now but I feel so self concious doing it, I would love to do it more though as I want to be fully sexual and not hold back.    I have started doing pilates to stengthen my muscles and improve my flexibility.|`|epQXDf9Kaa	Just rely on time and relax, let him teach you|`|6fce40fc087ca94205e0e0e2743c64f5aa	I love being on top b/c I get to control the situation and well as the old saying goes "practice makes Perfect" lol|`|NWH3MnE9aa	Guy in the room: It's called "cowgirl" and I haven't seen the woman yet who didn't understand that position well or have her own very experienced opinion on it.|`|o2GmpkvRaa	I feel confident being top, some females don't like being because males  make them in-confident because the make stupid remarks.|`|AA10652271	I am confident with being on top. It feels great and my husband loves it.
sCKegnDSaa	whats with all the negative answers???    Anyway    I wouldn't simply because he didn't remember yours maybe just a message or something just to wish him happy birthday just to show you remembered you never know he may feel bad and start talking to you again, realising his mistake.    You obviously miss him as as you were only friends I don't see whats the harm in sending a message all his other friends most likely will. It's hard loosing a friend especially one you have known for years.     I would suggest though that if he ignors you this time, I would leave him alone and let him get on with it.     Its his loss at the end of the day.|`|b2WGvF18aa	It won't seem like like your begging!!! it'll show how DESPERATE you are!!!!!!! MOVE ON!!!!!!!!|`|KbhADKrraa	Get a grip.....and a life!!!!!!|`|xRAdmupKaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!
DtcuaIWmaa	caps is the only one I that I known is not dangers|`|cxVmq2kraa	Suck and blow.  You put a piece of small paper or a movie size ticket kinda paper on your lips and suck it. You set up a line of people in boy girl order and you have to try and suck the paper off the other person's lips. If the paper falls you kiss the person. Eventually it will turn into having to make out with the other person.    Haha fun times.
EMcrAAn6aa	I'm 16... going through the same thing hun. I'm going on month 10 of the relationship. If you get passed the first 4 months or so and you still feel like you can't live without him... then you're in love babyyy!!! :) haha congrats|`|eQaApazjaa	well how long have u guys been going out? if u only have been for a week or two then it might just be puppy love..i mean ur still getting to know him but u prob like him sooo so much that u think its love but it probably really isnt. trust me ive like been in ur situation before sort of...just give it time. who knows..it might lead to REAL love eventually =]
wnbz5gNzaa	Like most gals would know, she knows you like her but probably did not want to hurt your feelings. Another thing, if she was interested in you she seems to be the type that would have let you know if she had the same feelings for you, by the little you have stated about her. I would cut my losses and move on, maybe she'll want you friendship later but for right now it appears you both need space. Sorry buddy, it happenes to everybody sometime.|`|XkR2nRGGaa	First of all she will come around if you really are that important to her bc if you are as good as you say you r to her all dem gurls come around and plus if you do go out with her its your choice to ask her and her choice to say yes/no so you shouldnt be scared because the worst she could say is no and you know what there goes the closure and you will feel a lot better. i think you should jus keep her as a friend if dat works out and move on w/ another girl. ^_^
8AFnU5m8aa	yeah I would if I was close to him. I wouldnt say she was cheating right off the bat though. Instead tell him what you saw (just like you did here) so he can be aware of it and make his own conclusions in order to deal with the situation. You wouldnt want him to turn around and put you on the other side for snooping on his girlfriend. (he probably wouldnt do that but you never know)|`|gxZqRdRiaa	hey way to go STEP BROTHER for one you invaded kates privacy my going on her myspace and checking her messages   when u should have just signed off   and second now she hates you for lying and never wants to talk to you again   and i know shes not cheating on me becuz i know the things she says to tristan and i know she didnt say that i knw the exact things she says and she hates him btw shes just trying to be a good person and not make him sad becuz he has a bad life  next time get the facts
cjnBs0h6aa	sounds like they could be jealous of you. Its a hard thing but thats how alot of girls are, like the movie mean girls. sorry get new friends because they arent your friends.|`|P0wMTzDFaa	You don't need them.    it's obvious you guys have different opinions in everything now,so the best thing to do is make new friends.  In my opinion,I think they're just jealous of you and all.      Your real friends don't put you down nor call you a  slut.  Get some real friends.|`|8ssiOsDzaa	JEALOUSY all the way. hang out with real friends who would tell you how hot you look in this skirt and who would give you tissues to dry your tears when you break up with your boyfriend and who would hook you up with the guy you find hot and not do what does fake friends are doing!|`|96nByQtMaa	one word:jealousy|`|3y0w1qIBaa	It seems it is your friends' fault, not you.  If they cannot accept for who you are then why waste your time?|`|LNnRSLdtaa	these girls are not your friends   hang with your guy friends|`|29THwRZuaa	Jealously is a very dangerous thing. Most of my female friends have gone "funny" on me.|`|teSTpOQeaa	i know how you feel.  girls can be like that.  if they act like that then they are not true friends.  either talk to them about how they are making you feel or get new friends..no one deserves that.|`|OI3bf4yjaa	If they put you down - they can't be real friends.|`|kb8xHjCFaa	They are jealous... you sound mature enough to let it run of your back. Maybe even make a joke of it... "oh, yeah... my knee-length mini is so slutty..."|`|c67H67ppaa	Your friends are probably just jelous, thinking that you have moved on, to other things. They may think that you aren't the same Anna that you were last year.|`|Dj5f1SRfaa	It is unfortunate but boys ruin sisterhood.  Despite feminism and the whole girl-power way of life, girls will forever be put at odds against each other because of men.  If you like hanging out with the guys, then be prepared to have a lot of girls hating you.   I went through the same thing when i was 13 (I'm 20 now). Just do what makes you truly happy- not popular, not lusted after.|`|AA11375099	You have become more attractive than they are and they resent it.  So, they cannot tell you that in your face.  It does not help that you dress like that because it really shows them that they are girls while you are an attractive young woman.    If you want those kinds of friends...better start dressing like a ten year old again...they don't appreciate your new sexuality.    girls will be girls.|`|6XVIGd3Oaa	First, and Most Important: If someone is consistently putting you down and finding nothing good to say to you, they ARE NOT a Best Friend!    I would say to confront them tomorrow.  Say, "Hey, guys...What's up? Why are you always putting me down? I don't like it, and if you won't stop, I can easily find new friends."    If they continue to act like that towards you, find some other people to hang out with.    Or stick to your guy friends, plus you'll be totally innovative and mature for having all the guys around YOU.    & your prissy little friends can stick it with their closed minded lack of boy experience.    Ever thought they might be jealous because you've kissed a boy and the boys might like you better?    I Really hope I helped! :)  Good luck!|`|JV0i77uiaa	Your friend must jealous because you look cute.  Find new friends, you have to stand up for yourself and don't pay any attention to these creep that you called friends.  It's not your fault, you seem to be depressed with broken heart.  If they are really your friends they would treat you in a different way.  Don't worry you have us here, you can ask anything you want.|`|E3tWPVEqaa	Find new friends|`|NAoOidnZaa	then they aren't your real friends.|`|ELzYeHUsaa	Sounds not like their not really your friends.|`|RQo2b3Muaa	well, first of all. they are not your real freinds.  If they are talking bad about you they are just jelous:)  so just dont worry about them  good luck:)  hope i helped!|`|spvTjotNaa	They are jealous i suggest you find new friends that is what i would do or just give them one more chance|`|Ov6TGigsaa	People change after the preschool years  Maybe it's better to move on and find better friends  The friends I had in elementary school I don't think I'd be able to STAND today.  Maybe they feel like you're growing apart and maturing faster so you're not one of "them" anymore, so they gang up on you.  Whatever it is, real friends wouldn't embarrass you in front of everyone or ignore when you're crying.  Make new friends. It'll take a while to find a true friend of course, but just keep an eye out and be friendly to people that seem trustworthy.|`|tNPw8fcJaa	It's ok.My friends used to do that.I found new friends when i got tired of it and stood up for myself.I only talk to them sometimes.Just stand up for urself and who cares if they hurt your feelings cause they are hurting urs...Hope i helped and good luck!|`|z7aYNtojaa	Well the way you describe it, its their fault, you should confront them and ask about it. Depending on how they answer, you might need new friends.|`|9EvQomRXaa	girls are bitches alot so sometimes its better to have guys as ur bestfriends!! its true ive been in the same sitch. as u so i can relate|`|fspebSraaa	well i think that you should probably slow down with the sexy dressing and the boyfriends, just remember you have the rest of your life to kiss and flirt but you only have RIGHT NOW to be a kid! i think that wherever you are kids are going to gang up on the odd one out so if your doing something that's not in the norm your going to hear about it but it sounds like there not friend material anyhow. good luck to you!|`|MzWiGnqdaa	Dress however you like and disregard everything else!|`|Xvcuncncaa	omg weird same thing happening to me!but skinny jeans and hot topic.i would find new friends.i did and im happier.if u wanna keep em talk to them confront them bout ther bitchyness.make sure you have another girl friend to back you up tho        mi friends wer from prek to.it sucks      hope this helps=]|`|BaIwTOUjaa	i know how you feel.  lately i have been having lots of problems with my girl friends. through out all of our problems, i have really seen the true people that they are. and it seems that the guy friends that i have, sincerely care more than the girls do. just make sure you know who your "true friends" are. and trust me you will know right away if they are even worth fixing things with.try sitting them down and talking to them about how you feel. if they don't listen, then it's there loss. but whatever you do, don't talk crap about them(like they are doing to you) because if you do, then they can hold it to you and make you look like the bad guy.|`|PYIHDmAiaa	i think that your friends are just jealous. and when you think about it, if they were ur best friends, they would'nt call you a slut. if i were you, i would just go up 2them and be like "r u guys like my friends or what? cause from what i remember, friends dont call other friends sluts soo..."|`|7c0ff0cdc42bafa66ae7ea8350f673d9aa	gurl, don blame your bestfriends... bestfriends always tell the truth..they say the meanest thing for good reason..bestfriend are like angels(even though you find it un-bearing) ... they don want you to get the wrong impression..   plus it seems your bestfriends haven't got boyfriends yet.. so they don kinda understand your situation yet..  honestly, they can see your realtionship, they definitely don't want to hurt your feelings but they have see your relationship in the long run will not really last...thats why they resent certain things you've did.  just be patient with them... they are not in your shoes yet... they'll understand you more in future..
405ff6a6add7381eb2911a89cabf05d6aa	guys don't like annoying, paranoid, emotional, clingy girls.  They don't like girls who talk about others such as gossiping,  They don't like stuck up snobs, two-faced, cheaters, or liars  they don't like girls who get jealous easily, or are mean to his friends  guys don't like girls who smell bad, or have bad breath  guys don't like boring girls, or girls that try too hard to fit in  Guys DO like a girl with confidence and LOVE a girl for simply being herself.|`|XkR2nRGGaa	some not most but some girls are teases so us dudes have to stay ahead and it seems like were just leadin them on but its there "fault" it seems like that in the first place|`|IDj3NwjDaa	talk,talk, talk, talk ,talk ,talk ,talk,talk talk|`|jyqK8Wrdaa	needy girls.|`|cp2182xNaa	Straight from my boyfriend's mouth.

e15607a8c66590d715420cbfe5d2db7faa	I don't think the smack in the face was a good thing to do.  I'm sure it hurt him even more and will remember that for a long time but it's now an emotional wound.  He was already hurt and your hurt him more. You'll have to apologize to him for that smack.  Tell him you didn't mean it and explain why you don't approve of his friend sleeping over.  Sometimes you just need to explain to a kid on how you feel about a situation instead of yelling.  Make him understand rather then getting angry at him. Be considerate of his feelings since he's still developing and learning about situations.|`|TtOCh3JSaa	You hitting your child is understandable if he's behaving like that but it's not the correct behaviour. Mostly for the reason that you've lost your patience with him and you end up feeling guilty afterwards and whether you mean to or not, he can probably sense that and will resent you for it. If your son behaves like that again, walk away. If he does something wrong, don't send him to his room or he'll start associating being in his room with being in trouble. Send him to the corner and ignore him for a full five minutes then when he's calmed down, explain to him why you said no to something. The fact you smacked him does not make you a bad mother but if it makes you feel like that, try not to do it.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	no... he shouldnt act like that and he NEEDS to know there are boundaries. so no u rnt a bad parent|`|HjMbOgvqaa	no but one with a short fuse next time smack his butt|`|rzPIO1aQaa	well hes only 5 there was no reason to slap him. chill out a little you scared the hell out of him. I know kids get stressful sometimes but you find a way to deal with it.|`|AA11967247	a smack in the face isnt the best choice. dont do that again.|`|AA12160092	a slap across the face seems a bit harsh...he is only 5 yrs old...maybe a swat on the hinny or a time out would have been enough|`|kBCTSremaa	I dont think you are. You are just being protective. If I had a son and he was crying like that I would probably smack him by anger.|`|OLQmoyNSaa	nope.  my mom did that to me before :P  thats good for you.  he shouldnt be acting like that.  thats a really bad attitude. you deserve  respect. your the one whos taking care  of him, the house, etc. :P|`|YmLcF2rSaa	Ok even good mothers lose thier tempers once in a while and its not good because ( a child lives what they learn ) however it isnt a unpardonable sin.Sit him down and explain to him that mommy was wrong and its not nice to hit.Then spend some time with him and tell him how happy you are that he is in your life! My 2yr. old monster take every thing he finds apart and it get tiresom|`|qsP6Umcpaa	well u could of explained to him that u dunt have room and enough food to share he would under stood u could of made up an excuse but smacking a child is harsh and i think thats a wrong thing to do with a child then after a few years later that child will be growned up with abusive behavior and if u talk to a child talk problems out and sort them out they wil understand and know whats right and wrong but now that you smacked him go and give him a hug and kiss him and say that you love him and you had a tough day at work or something good and promise him dat u will make cookies on saterdai      good luck and no it does not make u a bad mom jus need to control the temper and wait patiently|`|axwdwiSuaa	Well, errhhh       well it's not bad that you wanted to discipline him, but a spanking may have been more suitable for the situation.     Next time, try threatening to take away his favorite toy. If the yelling persists spank him with the pants on and then if that doesn't work tell him you have no problem going bare bottom, and then send him to his room.    Explain it's not how good children behave before punishing him.     Also i don't think you should ever slap a child across the face. (my jaw dropped when i read you slapped him across the face) After all he's only five, his conscious isn't fully developed yet. Most 5 yr. olds tend to be a little bit bratty sometimes.            Think about this next time you punish him please.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	next time, smack him on his ***.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	of course not. kids need to know their boundaries, their rules, when to stop, and how they should talk to their parents. every mother feels bad when they scream at or ground their child, or when they hear their child say 'i hate you', when they're teenagers. but as a parent, you have to do whats best for your child and teach your child the right morals and right from wrong, or otherwise he will think he can do whatever he wants when he wants it and will think that he can talk to you any way he wants.|`|q9yGiIPUaa	As long as you don't slap him around all the time then this time should be ok. I have a 6 year old son that throws fits like that and I'll tell you my first thought is smack him too, but I don't. I count to three then I send his little butt to the corner for 6 min, (his age) If he doesn't stop throwing his fit the time goes up.|`|AA12362903	No.  It makes you a mother who had a bad moment.  Next time try to take a deep breath and count to ten then send him to his room for at least five minutes to cool down (one minute per year of his life - ex. a 7 year-old would go for 7 minutes).  It's hard sometimes, I know because I have three little boys myself.  Hang in there.|`|YfUBxwDUaa	no but smack his butt not his face. once my mom slapped me and my brother in the face but it was really hurtful.she apologised later. its wayy more personal than a spanking. it could be apropriate to tell him you are sorry and you lost your temper and you shouldnt of slapped him in the face but he was being very disobediant and you should have sent him to his room or spanked him instead. btw it was probably more upsetting if you usually never do that.|`|QRraaOkLaa	Smacks in the face are bad.  That is what behinds are for.
ib2BLbDTaa	Um nothing. He's probably having a rough time right now.  He probably is stressed or maybe you are having money problems and don't realize it because your world doesn't revolve around finances and supporting a family.  Just do what you're supposed to do and stay outta his way.  Ignore it and try not to be so sensitive to it. Everyone has been yelled at by their parents before, guaranteed! Just do your own thing and stay away. I'm sure he'll notice he's being a bully when you don't want to hang out with him anymore.  Or maybe you can tell him what you're feeling when he's not in a bad mood.  (times to avoid parents:  when they just got off work and when they are paying bills, YIKES!!!)|`|mYAbq6fnaa	well your school life and home life are two different things. your school life may be great, but that doesnt mean that your home life is going to be. this will deprive you of a functional relationship with your father, and thats something that a 14 year old girl needs. i would talk to him about his habits, or try talking to your mom.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	with any luck you will start paying more attention to what you are doing!!!|`|Rd3nNYNNaa	Relax and dont let your father's scoldings affect your and your sibling's studies.Dont fight with him because that will make the situation worse.If you have any other close relative, ask them to talk to your father if your talk wont work on him.
J4W68owgaa	18|`|utyBYnrBaa	You don't really have to save up.. I took my CNA at a nursing home.. no cost no college and a guaranteed job. It was a 2 week course a week of classes and a week of clinical. You should be 17 18 or about to graduate from high school. Just go to your local nursing homes and ask them if they offer the CNA classes or call your local Independence agency and they  might have some information for you. Good luck|`|RzeYy8dTaa	I think 18 but not sure.Many nursing homes will pay you to go to school if you agree to work for them after.Hospitals may too.check around.
6fce40fc087ca94205e0e0e2743c64f5aa	my husbands mom made him choose before we got married... and he actually chose his family over me but then he took me out to dinner and proposed... I personally would say follow your heart,  and your family would have to understand.
mU4LyJ5Saa	In all honesty, unless he wants to get off drugs nothing you or anyone else say can change him.  It has to come from him, and there's not a whole lot you can do to make him decide.    The best thing to do is try to be a good role model for him, and introduce him to people who lead the kind of lifestyle you wish he had.  Just don't preach, be condescending, or over talk it or he will push you away.      If it becomes enough of a problem where it's really effecting his life, be sure to give him specific example of how.  This will help him realize that drugs are now more than just a fun social thing for him.  Emphasize everything that he is good at, what his potential is, and what his dreams are and tell him that drugs will hold him back from all of that.    Also, don't try to tell him all kinds of facts about drugs.  Those "scare tactics" really don't do much as a majority of them come from government agencies and can be biased.  Drug users have their own facts to dispute anything you come up with, so that is a method better left alone.|`|LXxxAzIqaa	If they are really your best friend then they will listen what you have to say to them, and how much you care.|`|Ts33DJSwaa	thats actually easier than you might think...the vital step is the education on the entire subjects of drugs, so get clued up first and understand the problem from that angle, i recommend a website called unite against drugs which is a campaign run by drug free international a charity. then gently direct her on the truths about drugs and how drugs are ONLY going to make things worse....|`|AA11806390	Honestly, tell his parents or a school guidance counselor. I'm sure you can do it anonymously.|`|l9lBWiR1aa	Alright, well you need to explain to him the bad things that can happen to him. Tell him the real affects of drugs, I've been the one on the other side of this problem, my friends trying to stop me from smoking pot. And I have, because I didn't wanna hurt your friends. Tell him that you really don't wanna be associated with him if hes gonna do drugs, he might be scared and decide to quit, who knows all guys are different. Just tell him the problems to may cause    -he could go to jail  -his parents could find out  -no girl would wanna go out with him  -you loose yourself in drugs and can get addicted    and more!|`|32079d59247ed72d60779c0cd34b7943aa	Check out some methadone clinics in your area. They help people who are addicted to drugs if the person wants off and needs help.
jNzkN6Rnaa	Go for it if there your friends there love you also my bffff is just like you and shes really fun so i think you should stick with who you are|`|yxoXTmlqaa	Friends will always label you, no matter how good you really are--verbal or inside themselves, but its best if its really hurting just tell them you're hurt. Since you're a girl, you guys are more close-knit and accepting of each other feelings.|`|mXwO9xmCaa	jst be yourself although friends to influnce how you dress and act!!
PO5Q7POuaa	Omg I read this and it's almost exactly the situation I'm in.  There's also a guy in my class who knows I like him, and he always teases all the other girls but not me and it makes me so mad that he doesn't pay attention to me =(  Okay so enough about my problems lets talk about yours, I will probably use a lot of examples from the situation I'm in just cause maybe it will be easier to understand then okay? I'm not trying to be self-centred or anything =P.  So you say that you want to start hanging out with him. What might be best is to start talking to him, like maybe if you're shy start online and then you two can develop some common ground . If you know his interests you could maybe invite him somewhere with you and your friends one afternoon, for example if he plays hockey you could ask him to go skating or something.Or you could always ask him for help with math homework or whatever class it is you have with him. Right?  I know it probably sucks to think he likes another girl but hopefully he will realize that you're way better.   Maybe if you become good friends first he will realize how much of an awesome girl you are and want to be more than friends ;). Fun, yes? That's what I'm hoping will happen with my guy. Just keep talking to him and show him how awesome you are =) And remember to flirt flirt flirt. And if he doesn't like you.. just remember it's his loss not yours =D|`|BY02DhfWaa	why are you doing this to your self you said he knows you like him and he is hanging out with a girl that he likes and i take it, it is not you my point is, don't do this to your self you  dont deserve this you can do better ..|`|qIwiGY0Caa	Even if he knows you like him, it's not love since you haven't hung out with him.

AA10714600	It really depends on what kind of a guy he is.  If this guy has had past girls/girlfriends then he may just want to do stuff with you like fool around.  Or this guy just has that type of personality who really knows things about you and has gotten to know you for you and really is "attracted" to your personality.      I say I am attracted to someone when I have hung around them enough to be like wow!! you're a great person and I kinda am starting to have some feelings for you.  Thats what is meant when I have that feeling.     So take your pick... has he been around the block or does he really seem like a good guy?     Good Luck!!|`|ECjHm2YLaa	Your super hot or he's super Randy baby!|`|qDpFSqn4aa	It means he has the hots for you.  He loves the way you look and he'd like to be more than just friends.

AA11538662	The son will in fact be entitled to his late fathers estate no matter what mom does.    Mary in Camden, MI|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	"Wee succeed to convince her for another marriage".. In what country?    In Western countries, the estate passes automatically to the widow.  When she dies, her estate is passed on to whomever she specifies in her will.  Even if the man willed his belongings to his son, the son must be 18 to inherit them. Until that time, they are in trust, with the mother in charge of the trust.  Her re-marriage has absolutely no bearing on anything.      But it all depends on what country you're in...|`|kqa9VFrfaa	She can be sure if she puts it into writing  before the marriage.|`|y21VcTjDaa	Are you saying that there was a clause in her late husband's will that transferred his half of the marital estate to his son in the event that she remarries?  If so, how cruel!  Was he that controlling while he was alive?|`|wpi36XBAaa	If the husband passed over 4 years ago, the probate (property settlement/will) should have already been settled, and those conditions apply.  If it gave all the property value to the wife, then it remains hers, but may become community property when she remarries. If some amount was awarded to her son, then that remains his, no matter who she marries.
bLbuQS2vaa	there really isn't anything you can do just live in the moment and hope it will last forever. I know you are much older then me but I am  in love too.. and have been for years. I'm just glad your situation is better then mine. So be glad that you have this amazing guy at your side and just cherish every moment spent together, and just keep your head up and be optimistic. everything else is up to fate. I hope everything stays so well for you.

Use birth control or condoms ( a lil late) but ya you're a kid who's having a kid.

Wish ya the best of luck, your baby is going to bring you a lot of happiness whether you like it or not :P and it will put things in perspective of whats really important to you. 2 years ago (when i was 17) i would of called you a **** but thats just the norm nowadays. Again good luck!|`|UlTjAC8maa	I would probably think you were a ****. I'm not sure, I would probably say that. What 13 year old sleeps with 8 guys? But then I wouln't really judge you right off because I don't know you, but other people will, especially since your pregnant. I would think you were stupid though, already pregnant, that's probably going to ruin your life, but I do think you should keep the baby. At least don't abort it, I have a friend that's 14 and pregnant to and everybody judges her right off. It sucks.|`|vjxroyxjaa	Well Lexi, i think that it is good that u r keeping the baby and not turning to abortion or somethn. I hope that all goes well during ur whole pregnancy and motherhood. I do think that being 13 and havn sex with 8 guys multiple times is somethn that u should not b proud of and i hope ur not. I dont lik using the word ****. I just think that hormones really hit u hard and u must hav a big thing for sex and must hav low self control too but its ur life. I also might hav to question ur parents too. I think uve made some bad decisions but u can turn ur lif around if u want to. The past is over so just focus on the future.   Best of Luck with everything Lexi!  -Phillypride2012mtu@yahoo.co,

l9lBWiR1aa	Okay, so I see you don't wanna say what you did to her. That would've kind of helped, no matter how good or bad it was. Well to get her to be your friend again just sit her down and have a heart to heart conversation. Tell her that your friendship means more than what happen, and that you dont wanna loose her as a friend. Tell her about all the good times you've had and that you dont wanna drift apart from her and you didnt mean to hurt her when you did whatever it is that you did. And that you are truely sorry and that you wanna forget about it and be best friends still. If she still doesn't, then maybe its her and not you.    :) Hope I helped.|`|ZJd0OM0caa	you need to think first if she dosnt trust you then how can you trust her?  and if u say she is a best friend then she shouldnt care best friends are there for eachother everyday and every step of the way . its just the way things are .

I think you would be best to sit down and calmly talk things through with your fiancee and explain to her that just because you went to see your step sister, it does not mean that you don't listen to or value your fiancee's opinions. If she doesn't want to sit and talk, could you not get her family or friends to have a chat with her regarding her control issues, because that's what they sound like to me. If it was the other way around and it was you that wouldn't let her see her family, you would be called not fit to burn, perhaps she needs to realise that.    Good luck I hope you can work things out for the sake of your sanity and your son.|`|AA12198711	You are an individual, aside from him. You should be able to make your own choices without expecting him to dictate to you.

The thing with family, no matter how bad someone sees them they are your family, remember that.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	sit down w/ her and have a talk.. tell her that you love her but you still have some responsibilities towards your family... just b/c they have made mistakes does not mean that you throw them out of your lives... you have to learn how to forgive sooner or later... try to explain to her that you were only saying hi to your sister... you cant break the tie completely... if she doesnt like ur sister and the reat of ur family... its ok... u arent forcing her to keep in touch w/ them... but you have to do your part and do the small gestures that make your family your family... i hope this helps ;)    help:  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...
8FuwpE56aa	maybe you could say that ur gonna shave ur head or get a really short cut and then ...never mind...that's mean.    maybe you could talk to her tell her that its ok to be different.  also, maybe you could go shopping and tell her what would look really cute on her and don't buy anything ( or something that isn't in her size).     good luck!!|`|YfTMBFIIaa	No offense, but she doesn't seem to be copying you that much.  She just wants a cool room like you.  If I could have a mini fridge I would get one two.  You think they are awesome.  I think they are awesome.  She thinks they are awesome.  She could get one, so she did.  As for the makeup brushes, I'm sure she thought that they were amazing and  liked them enough to buy herself some.  Is it wrong to want quality items for yourself?  No, it is not.  The hair straightener--she probably went to the store and got the same one as you because it was nice and on sale.    Don't worry about it.  You own a few of the same things.  So what.  It becomes a problem when she starts buying the same clothes as you.  But that hasn't happened yet.  Don't worry about it.

14e3f62e4aadac6dc3e97d2ea1b5e895aa	This is typical teenage behavior of a girl who wants to be  popular, but isn't.  She will try to elevate her own importance by putting others down.  Once your friends  get some perspective and insight, they will see her for  what she is.    The very sad thing about this is that I am a Senior Citizen and I had a very close friend, and she is acting just like  your friend.  It's like high school all over again.  I have chosen not to do anything, unless of course she pushes  me too hard then it's WHOP IN THE KISSER.|`|l22Neymmaa	Tell her shes being really rude and ask her why she would point that out if she knows its gonna make you mad.|`|hOeV5R4naa	whatever shes doing, shes not a real friend.     shes just a hater.

How long have you guys been "talking" since you reconnected? If it hasn't been long, then be friends first. By friends, I mean lots and lots of communication.

I know what it's like to have a sibling away from you and its even worse because you can't stop anything bad from happening to them. Im sorry about your older brother. All you can do is wait and have hope for your brother. Im guessing you really love your brother and care about him and you dont want to lose him especially since you guys got into a fight about your parents but nevertheless he knows you love him and care for him. Dont think that he is going to die dont think that for a second you have to be strong and i know its hard its okay to feel sad but you cant give up hope or else it will just bring you down. If you can take an urgent flight to the hospital than do it. All you can do is wait but try not to think about the negative things because it will make you even more overwhelmed about this situation. You have to try to keep your hopes up and your family has to try to keep their hopes up when something like this happens it all comes down to the person! I hope your brother is okay and makes it through for now just try to keep calm remember you have other siblings, so if you freak out they are going to freak out too i wish you the best|`|il7bLkSIaa	unfortunately he might really die, and I know the feeling.    Jan 10 of this year I got a call from my sister that my dad has been electrocuted at work and fell off a ladder. The doctors told us he was bleeding in his brain, his ribs were broken, his lungs and liver were failing, his pelvic bone was broken, he was paralyzed, and his chest was broken open. My dad had been in bad accidents before so our whole family had hope that he would be ok.    The doctors kept coming in the room and telling us it was getting worse and worse, that all the electricity in his body did not escape which was causing all his organs to burn up. Overnight he had become brain dead and not even 2 days later he died.    Our whole family is absolutely devastated. My dad was seriously the most beautiful, sweet, hard working, optomistic, loving person I have ever met. I am still in shock that this has happened and I cry everyday. I am actually crying as I write this.    I truly hope your brother makes it because I dont wish the pain my family is going through on anyone else.     I held my dads hands in the hospital when he was dying and I can honestly say it is the most heart breaking image that will unfortunately stay in my head forever.    If you want to e-mail me, please feel free...I would like to know your brother is ok.    xxpinaacoladaaxx@yahoo.com

12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	We want the nice guy (who has confidence).      The reason you meet woman with your jerk ways....if you acutally do...is because many women have some issue.  Either they have been in an abusive relationship or assulted before, they're worried about their self image or confidence, they compare themselves to unrealistic goals, or they just think they're tired of being alone and are willing to be blind to your faults and fool themselves into thinking you'll change or they'll be happy.    You want to be nice and talk and encourage women to get through their problems and to have confidence in themselves.    Everyone wants to feel loved.  Show her you love her!  Give her some flowers or rub her sholders and talk to her and tell her you were hurt by some of her behavior and ask why she did that and tell you how it made you feel.  Love will give you the courage to be honest and open...that is what every woman wants.    Good luck!|`|v3Y0Wij8aa	I say the nice guy has it all over the bad boy!     Bad boys attract superficial relationships and are afraid of true intimacy, they are insecure and have low self esteem. Vulnerability sends them running for cover.    Like attracts like..let your light shine and you will attract the love of your life....it is universal law.     Be true to yourself and you can be false to no man.|`|ljwJr6u8aa	balance is most important|`|eTxLlbvDaa	To me personally, maybe you should be nice from the begining.  It will really make a diffrence.  Women think your weak once you start being nice when you were all big and bad in the starting.|`|8ylxofidaa	For me I would like a happy medium (if it even exists)... Not someone that kisses my *** and not someone that is a complete jerk either.     You said a nice guy that is not spineless. A guy that goes out of his way to make his girl feel appreciated. That is something that women want, trust me. The issue you might be having is with how nice you are, the frequency in which you do special things, etc. I want to be romanced, but I like a little chase too. Sometimes a guy can go a little overboard with how nice they are being and it can come across as kissing ***. Everything in moderation. Do something sweet for her and then step back a little and allow her to do something sweet for you. Even if I am really liking a guy I will show him only a little until he gives me something to work off of. Its a give and take process. Be sweet, but not too sweet. Make her feel important but don't let her think that your life revoloves around her either. Happy medium and balance is the key.     Hope this helped!!!

When you pass him or catch his eye across the room, look over into eyes and maybe give him a half-smile. You don't always have to talk to communicate.  Step2  Insert yourself in his circle of friends next time you see him. If you've made eye contact before, chances are he'll remember you. Laugh at a joke or make a funny comment to him. Sometimes it's easier to communicate in a group at first than one-on-one.  Step3  Walk right up to him if you're brave enough. Tell him you've noticed him lately and then ask how he's doing. This sparks a conversation that may lead him to ask you if you want to grab some lunch together. If he's not getting it but seems glad to talk to you, ask him yourself.  Step4  Drop something on purpose as you walk past him. Make it seem like an accident. You can either choose to walk back and pick it up, exclaiming how clumsy you are, or he may pick it up for you. This method works best if you're uncomfortable approaching him out of the blue.  Step5  Keep your confidence up. Guys can sense when you're uncomfortable or painfully shy. The more confident you appear when talking to a guy you've never talked to before, the more interested he'll be.|`|WuHxJ59Gaa	Um. Maybe stop being such a dumb annoying whore?

AA11263103	home alone    The basics     1. Brush your teeth, get a good bath, nicely groomed and clean and fresh, before meeting the other person. There's nothing worse than kissing the rear end of a garbage truck     2. Get into a comfortable position - you can't kiss if your back feels like it's gonna break. Suggestion - Sit side by side on a comfy sofa.     3. Hold your lover , firmly but gently - don't cause pain. Suggestion would be to hold the shoulders, the neck or gently on the side of the face, one side or both sides.     4. Move your faces closer. Don't bump noses. Suggestion would be the guy angle his face slightly so you don't bump noses.     5. Kiss gently, normal closed lips kissing, and close your eyes. Closing your eyes increases the sensations you feel, and also sets the mood.     6. Continue kissing gently. Get comfortable with simple closed lips, lip-to-lip kissing before going anywhere else.     7. If fine till here, tentatively, slowly and lightly draw your tongue across the other person's lips.     8. Chances are from here, if the other person lightly parts her tongue, slowly explore the other person's tongue in a light licking motion.     9. The tongue has a very sensitive surface, which is why tongue to tongue is the essence of french kissing.     10. After you've tried lightly licking the other person's tongue, you can try sucking on it, wrestling with it ( see if you can hold it to the floor of her mouth ) and other things like that.     11. Explore the other areas of the mouth. Especially the roof of the mouth. Lightly lick, or tickle the area with your tongue.     12. Don't bite. whatever you do, don't bite.     13. Don't swing your tongue round and round like a windmill. Explore lightly, don't drill your way through.     14. Breathe through your nose. Breathe through your nose. I say again, breathe through your nose.     15. Follow so far? You can lightly use your hands too, lightly rubbing the other person. Suggestions, along the waist, along the back, the arms, especially the inside of the arm, the neck, maybe running your fingers through her hair. Again, don't cause pain.     16. Continue kissing.  yes a movie is good, hitch,  why?no.
hJDbOKR6aa	Your trying way too hard. Big turn off. Don't text people when they never text you. Its usually a sign they're not that interested. Just be yourself. Eventually you'll attract people and potential friends.
b6ccac7a047169fde765030620090cc2aa	if you guys talk on msn he should notice you.. and believe me give him a chance not all guys r pigs lol i dont blame him for being shy because its hard to talk to someone that you never talked with in person i suggest you tell him to meet you somewhere afterschool...so you guys can finally hangout tell him over msn or myspace..and just be funny once you guys finally do hangout hopefully he will talk and the akwardness will go away..good luck =)

4lWD7ktjaa	uugh i know your pain! i go to an all girls school and absoultely hate it (im transfering next year tho!! :D)anyway find a cute guy if he hasnt found you yet and start talking,get to know each other, and after a little ask if he wants to dance. Grab his hand and have him follow you into the crowd.Then position yourself and start dancing.Thats when the grinding starts :)  If your too shy to do that then just get to know a group of guys and before you know it they will ask you themselves.If you get a group of guys then i know for sure more than one will ask you to dance.  Hope i helped :)

But your both good looking.|`|cno2OHmzaa	1--he looks more natural and carefree.     2 looks like he tries to hard.|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	neither, sorry|`|jPlUycx0aa	Guy Number two|`|oxWpo4bqaa	Guy number 1.    Guy number two needs to lose the 'stach and not keep his hair as in the first picture.|`|qIwiGY0Caa	Guy number one seems more friendly. I'd be more willing to approach him than number two.|`|SHRZH4d3aa	They are the same guy....|`|7AFLaiYjaa	no offense but neither of you are cute!|`|joa30mM8aa	neither...yikes|`|4XCg1mIMaa	guy number 2 :)|`|AA11285960	1..looks kinder and more relaxed   2 looks like he's sort of guido with all that hair gel.  girls don't want someone who spends more time in front of the mirror than they do.|`|FvGKbFlaaa	Guy   1 - a 6     Guy   2 - a 7|`|x7iQb0r3aa	Ditto what megan said.

Guy two's baby daddy dirt 'stache is less than unpleasant and should be removed with force if he won't comply. If you don't have the hormones to grow out a real one yet, save it for your golden years. Girls don't like peach fuzz. 3.
ATyHswTTaa	If its just the history itself that she deleting and not the cookies then can see which sites been on by finding the cookies in the hard drive.. not sure which folder it is in, but if have good nose through every folder on the pc/laptop u will find loads there on backup folder..     if its everytime she on the pc that deletes the history then she is def hiden something from u, otherwise she leave it there for u see, if nothin to hide then she would not be deleting any of this..     other signs she may be cheating:    she holding onto her phone always, even brings it to the loo and shower..  all her inbox and outbox and call history empty at end the day when comes home from work/college or when u come home..  the ring tone is silent when with u or if calls come in she leaves room and wispers or phone is turned off..    she coming bed later then u and always when u are asleep, or goes b4 u and when there is asleep..  she picks fights with u over smallest things ie. how wash the dishes that do same every time..  she wearing more make-up, new clothes and getting dolled up to go to shopping or work..  she wants go out more with her mates then with u.  the sex become less or alot more then normal = quilty sex..    hope this helps but if not there is software can get which tracks every key stroke so can see what she is typing when she usen the pc/laptop..    wish u look in this situation!|`|89YkHxMUaa	No but i would just lay low and watch.|`|x3LclBZ0aa	cant you just sit her down and talk to her in a serious but non accusatory way? believe me, unless youre ready to face the possible consequences, snooping is just opening up cans of worms you dont need.   is there no trust? has the relationship been faltering for some time? has she exhibited behavior that made you think that shes cheating?  trust me, this is a slippery slope.|`|PvAIY7OPaa	Provide her with your email account and ur password to her first and let her know that you are not cheating. From what i gather you are already cheating on her and u think she "MIGHT" be cheating on you. You dont need to check other people emails or history and that is very disrespectfull. Again, i think you are cheating|`|QSodlfMraa	if she cheat, thats different but if she does it a lot dump her, dont be a chick and check her things.|`|ITfBQzg6aa	I Don't think there is but Good Luck..|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	If she's deleted the history, that's a pretty big red flag in itself.|`|6u8D2iZ4aa	take it to a professional
BopBYwSdaa	why torture yourself? you said you learn a lesson so move on.     When you open up yourself to a new love then it could come to you... how could something new come to you when you are chasing EX's shadow?    You love him or you love having him (own him)? Most important of all, love yourself... stop hang out EVERY WEEKEND .. maybe every weekend you should be dating someone new?     Someone is looking your way but maybe you are too busy only looking and waiting on your EX... he moved on and so should you|`|Tbr9dHA9aa	OMG i felt the same way when me and my bf broke up.  I got so jealous whenever he hung out with those other girls.  But whatever happens, happens. Thats how life is, it has the hardships and being heartbroken is one of them.  Your break up is probably for the best because in the future you'll find someone better tthan him that you'll absolutely love.  good luck|`|Y32OhOVoaa	Look hunni. this is life im afraid. love hurts. and if im honest its the most bull**** feeling on this earth. i know your hurting. but whatcan you do about it? unless he falls for you again. to be honest theres not much to can do. it will take time. im not gunna say "get over it" cause i no its not that easy. justwait and things will be fine again    it happened to me about a yearago and nbow i have a new boyfriend who ive been going out with for nearly a year. and to be honest im gald i got out of thatother relationship.    so dont worry. you will learn to love again|`|iqtOa0Boaa	OMG, i am going to the same thing. Me and my ex called it quits and now we hang out as friends but its too hard to be friends. you have to LET IT GO, just pray and have strength in god, and he will help heal your heart!|`|3kilCNkoaa	You have to cut him out of your life entirely. Seeing him on teh weekends is just going to make it harder for you. Take him out of your phone book, and put everything that reminds you of him in a box. Start a new life for yourself without him. Heart break is one of the hardest pains to deal with.. but everyone goes through it sometime or another.. Good luck!|`|4RiziMD0aa	aww i feel the same way. i feel like whats wrong with me. why aren't I good enough but i know i am and maybe we were not meant to be. it hurts so much and i cry a lot but i am trying to be positive and think of something else i'm getting back into photography to keep my mind busy and i hope time will heal my broken heart. cuz i know how you feel like its the end of the world your heart is empty and ready for him to fill it again, but sadly he won't. so try to find something to keep your mind busy and only time will heal our broken hearts but us gals have to be strong and positive, and not give up. i know love is out there for me and you! good luck!|`|362adadcf07b8c4be23f083bb0e84126aa	okay breathe you'll get through this eventually....i think you need a long break from him to gather yourself and put yourself first. i think you lost sight of who you are and you need to find that independence again to become a stronger person. best of luck|`|pizsAvupaa	Trust me I understand what you are going through "/ their was this girl nd it waz all goin great but then I.D.K what hppned we lost it nd we were 2getha for a VERY long period of time nd we juzt thru it all away so now she's with another guy 2 yearz older nd wen I see them makeing out in my head am thinkin..."damn dat could've been me" nd so yea I still can't get over it but am doin better ...the trick iz 2 move on and find another "mate" nd try 2 avoid haveing 2 tak with your ex.

4GSONKgEaa	It means he has been reading too many books... or worse... he's flaky.|`|8y8PpQvnaa	Just saying he misses you. But he's trying to make you swoon by using romantic words like essence.

2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	It's not constructive to "pressure" someone into something they are uncomfortable with. A constructive way to go about the situation is discuss your respective views and talk about how they can be reconciled.     On the one hand, marriage is not a guarantee that this person is not going to break up with you; plenty of marriages end in divorce. Whether you're married or not, anytime you love someone, you're taking a risk - a huge risk; there's no way around it. If you don't want to get hurt, don't get involved in a relationship - period.    That said, there are reasons why you might want to be married - be it legal, social or emotional reasons. If your partner is against marriage *in principle*, which is what it sounds like from your description, it won't do you any good to "pressure" him/her to abandon  their principles - just as you feel strongly about marriage being desirable, they probably feel just as strongly that it is undesirable. It has more to do with emotion than with reason, so rational arguments are unlikely to have any effect. You *can* try and reason with the person, but you have to formulate for yourself what your plan of action is going to be if this person sticks to their guns. Are you willing to stay in the relationship even if marriage is not in the picture? Or would you choose to walk away? You need to proceed with this decision in mind.|`|uBssj3Znaa	yes because you can't guarantee that your marriage won't end, which it probably will if you pressured them into it in the first place. If someone truly loves you, let the cards fall where they may. Marriage isn't the end all be all.|`|qfVE2KFtaa	Yeah it's wrong|`|cFrtOg45aa	Yes it is wrong to pressure someone to marry you. Where is your pride? You don't want anyone to think that your that desperate. Being married isn't that great. It's a lot of hard word and takes two people who both have mutual respect for one another. If you look desperate how can he have any respect for you. Try acting like you don't care. Show your independence. Nobody wants somebody that is going to be an emotional dependent wreck. If you continue using the tactics your using you will lose him for good.|`|xxT7YGcMaa	Not necessarily,  if you want to be married and have that license.  If things are good and have been for along, long time there is not a whole lot of difference between an extended relationship and marriage.  Is it just because they are scared of the word marriage or commitment?|`|AA11348136	It is never okay to pressure marriage on someone. Even if you get married, that is still know guarantee. It seems that you have some insecurity issues that you need to deal with.|`|xDaesbudaa	No successful marriage is borne from coercion, and marriage is not a cure for some personal ill, either.  It's more sacred than that.|`|N2sr8xX9aa	Marriage is tough enough anyway but to put pressure on anybody you are setting yourself up for a failed situation.  You should seek help from a professional person and take their advise  accordingly.          Mildred is my leader|`|LVlS4y7Caa	Marriage is no guarantee of life long love, nothing is.  It takes TWO and your's sounds a little clingy and one-sided.  I wouldn't pressure ANY man my dear, it'll backfire at some point and why would you do it anyway?  -That is, IF, you're secure within yourself.  When children are involved, sometimes its a different story and marriage becomes more important due to providing security/name/support to a child.  Yet still, you can't "pressure" some one to love you or be with you if they don't want too...and sure, any thing can happen along the way to change the course of that love, for better or the worse.    You want a guarantee and there is none...we all take our chance(s) in this life with others...and we hope our love lasts and act accordingly.    Under no circumstances should any woman who has any element of self-esteem and autonomy force another into a relationship because they are afraid...    Sincerely,    Grace|`|vFCva8R5aa	You need some counseling.. There is NO guarantees in life even if you do get married.|`|6hBKoN6Jaa	NEVER pressure someone to marry you.  If he/she loves you it will come naturally.  You are the prize.|`|YYAu9lFDaa	wow... sounds like you have a LOT of security issues...    don't pressure him into marrying you, i think you need counseling if you're trying to kill yourself.    i honestly wouldn't get married if i were this paranoid, it doesn't seem like it'll work out right... good luck
Q7khVUL6aa	Being a girl, I have lost many best friends because of this. And it is almost proven that guys and girls can't be best friends because either sex gets in the way or one or the other likes them back.     From a guy's point of view, saying that she denies you, but acts as though she still wants you may seem like she's just playing with you.     If she isn't ready give her some time, however, if she says it to you she isn't interested, you should move on. If you're planning on moving on, it's just easier to see her as a close family friend of some sort.|`|b1e77b2aab8ad2bca3a05a7936c3211caa	I had a crush that lasted 3 years and he felt the same but had a girlfriend. i finally let him go because I was torturing myself. He came back and guess what i didnt feel the same|`|rd6eRnzTaa	Honestly, she isn't into you. And probably won't be (but you never know.) but she seems like she is just very comfortable with you, that's why she snuggles up and all that. But if you say she isn't sure about her sexuality..she's probably gay as well.|`|3fcRyGvnaa	it sounds like your playing boyfriend for her when she doesnt have one.  which is not fair on you at all!  maybe you should take a break and find a new girl to hang out that would be interested in begin your actually girlfriend.  hope it all works out|`|LaqZzaq6aa	Give it up, bro. She's not interested.  You are in the Friend Zone. Basically, as a man you provide security and comfort, but you're too predictable to be considered a lover.    Forget about her, otherwise you're only going to be torturing yourself.|`|cGK3c1A7aa	try to keep a distance and dont think about her too much you will just get lovesick|`|y4uoDjV0aa	Okay. I have almost the same situation. Go for it. If you two have been together forever, why do you think you won't be together for a forever more? Do you want to see her with anyone else? I'm guessing no. Does she wan't to be with anyone else? I'm guessing that's a no too. So go for it, what's left?    Be serious and show her you two will be together.
e8f304081fca5eabe282a819a91143f3aa	14 years old until I was 16.  He was the best thing to happen to me in my whole life, until he broke up with me.  I still love him today, 39 years later.  It's a different kind of love, like you would love a family member.... Because when we were together, I was like a part of his family, and treated that way by them.  Great memories.|`|ZVTcZTwcaa	i was 14 and he was and still the best     P.S we are lovers till now but we have some problems i pray that every thing returns as good as it was|`|1AWrpvpyaa	well when i had my first real boyfriend i was 12|`|xkMadpW5aa	i'm 13 and haven't yet|`|eQaApazjaa	12 but it was like a stupid relationship haha. everyone in middle school went out with eachother for like a week     i havent ever really had a real real boyfriend yet bc i dont really like committment..im 16 but next year when im a junior ill want one|`|Jzzl2QAmaa	11|`|7THgBSvfaa	I'm not sure.. Probably around 13 or 14..|`|Tbr9dHA9aa	i was 12 and those weren't "real" relationships at my age
hVEGaRMbaa	Get pregnant and trap him into a bitter marriage. Nah, just kidding! Hey, he signed up for his hitch and there's no legal way out so you just have to wait...|`|mJ0qetDFaa	Awee,well congratulations girly. Lots of women have army boyfriends. if you really have feelings for him and want to be with him, the right thing to do would be to wait for him. You two should talk it out and decide whether or not you want to committ to one another or not.good luck :)!|`|rmmNS689aa	the reasonable thing would be to wait|`|8vfCRg7Caa	sorry to tell you, but you waited too long. What you can do is save you feeling and problems in the long run. Dont make it a couple if hes just leaving now. Cause you havent even built up trust yet. And im guessing you dont have much sex with alot of people cause you wouldnt even worry about this like some dont worry about it. Id say just wish him luck and hope he comes back safe. And then if he does continue on with the relationship or if hes got somebody else or you do, just continue on with the friendship thing. He sounds young so you still have time. If you really like him alot you will have no problem just letting him go to bootcamp without all that commitment to worry about. He has enough to worry about. The best thing you can do is write him letters. Nothing says you care more than writing letters. A card or two might be nice. Just as friends.|`|vvQBkzCtaa	a month is worth waiting if you like the guy and in your heart you feel he is feeling the same. other wise move on.
VSVQHKwKaa	It hurts like a severed limb and you're about 10 years too young to do this.     Put it out of your head.     Good Luck!|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	You are too young. Piercing your belly button is painful and there are many risks, my friend got it done and bled like crazy can't even wear the ring years later and has a scar. And plus, it looks bad and shows up under shirts. I'd suggest you don't do it, but if you and your parents both agree that you want to go ahead, there aren't any laws (as far as I know) restricting you from piercing your belly button.|`|RswPfvtEaa	yes, young..but yes, it hurts.     and no, no law, but your parents will have to sign. because you arent 18|`|vXvNeGIjaa	YOU ARE TEN YEARS OLD!!!!!! GET A LIFE!! you don't get a frikken belly button ring when you're ten. get you ears peirced and go to chuck e cheeses....    im not even getting mine til im 16, dude... wow|`|2ezj28u1aa	ur crazy, ur too young|`|M2JNgbI1aa	yes it hurts and it can get infected  think twice before you do it,.!!!|`|MfUMaKcDaa	you have to have a parent present when you get it. and yes it does hurt, and can get infected. and it'll be there for the rest of your life, so just know what you're doing...|`|Ff9Ryt8gaa	first off talk to your parents about this first and it depends on the person rather or not it hurts..i watched my friend get hers done and they use a clamp and squeeze hard so u cant feel the needle go through a whole lot and plus they do it fast..yea theres a little bit of pain but not much..since ur 10 u might want to wait til ur 13 atleast...up here in ohio u got to be 13 with a parent|`|gg989pZkaa	It'll hurt, but only for about a week, and you need to have your parents be there to give the OK|`|hqq8sKk9aa	any profession piercing place will not pierce you until you 15 even with parental consent.  I wanted to get mine when i was 14 and my parents refused and it was illegal.  It wasn't until i was 16 that i got it done, and surprisingly me and my mom got it done together.  I didnt think it hurt physically, but as soon as the needle went through i freaked out and felt really light headed.  Looking back it was not that bad and im really glad i did it so i would recommend getting it done, but you have to wait until you're 15...|`|AA10714600	Well, I am a guy and from my perspective; some do not like them and could be a turn off.    Here is the deal, my friends that are girls have gone to get it done and they say it hurts a little bit but the pain doesn't last long.  Another thing they get annoyed with is cleaning it all the time so it doesn't get infected.  So think about this stuff before you get it.  You may think it looks cute and so may your girlfriends but that will scar and be with you if you  later decide to take it out.    You may just want to think about it more, but there are no rules against it other than you must be 18 or have a parent or guardian with you.    Good luck with your choice kiddo!!! :-)|`|4ICs8mnTaa	most places say you have to be 16 even with a parent  but if your lucky you can find somewhere to do it for 13/14
zHWGnPvvaa	Maybe he was surprised you would be smiling at him. Maybe get his aim and talk to him about it on the internt. That usually helps me when i need to talk to someone. Or perhaps text.   Hope this helps|`|15SKYIlFaa	you should make eye contact that's the best starting point and after that try smiling at him. and do that till he smile's back then the next time you see him try saying hi. After a while start a convo with him. and as for him looking confused it was probably because he has never talked to you or really seen you till then and he didn't know if you were smileing at him or someone else...or if he had something on his face.|`|AA10861346	confused
4GSONKgEaa	A lot of young women are making this complaint of late.  i would advise you never to come between a boy and his x-box (basket ball game, red velvet cake)... it's not about growing up so much as i know some older guys pretty in love with their geek toys.    i would suggest you find something to "love" of your own.  That's how us mature (read as "old") women get by.  If he wants to make love to his electronics, let him.  You just come off as a nag when you try to separate them.  Find your own fun and meet him in the middle.    gentle thoughts...|`|HIO0yvK0aa	right.... depends on how long u've been dating,  but u gota lay down the line.|`|SDnhUMv9aa	Me! I realise I am 14 so it is not the same but, often when I am talking to my boyfriend he just blanks me when he is playing! I mean i am not asking him to give me all eyes, all ears all the time. But just some of it!  laura x|`|7Xfoa8Ziaa	I think my girlfriend would say the same thing!  I have to admit, it's pretty adictive, and i never thought i'd be a gamer!  Whatever you do, don't let him get Elder Scrolls- Oblivion!  You'll never see him again!  ;)|`|fus54EX3aa	X BOX FU*KING RULES!!!! IF ANYTHING YOU NEED TO GET OVER IT OR CHOP THAT FOOL UP WHILE HE"S PLAYING!!!|`|LcOS9jjMaa	omg you should read my question, pretty much same thing!!        http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...      weird!!|`|GO7tZtPxaa	I wouldn't let my partner get away with it :)|`|Xverqpu4aa	Maybe you should have sex with him. I doubt the Xbox could do that.|`|C9BctAMQaa	I play Xbox too, honestly though. Getting laid is ALOT Better.     But Xbox is still awsome. lmao|`|8y8PpQvnaa	So he's spending a couple of days with his friends, what's the big deal? Do you not have your own life to go live? Maybe you need to go make some friends of your own so you can have fun while he is with his friends. He's just your boyfriend, you two aren't married and you are living separate live. If it bothers you so much then go talk to him about it.|`|cmEi3CVqaa	YES omg! i hate that thing! my bf does it too and i know its mean and verges on blackmail but i ask him whats more important, me or xbox? and make him feel bad for ditching me for a game! its bugs the hell out of me!! so yh u shud just lay it down to ur bf and make him chose and if he choses the xbox (though he shouldn't!) let him know how much it anoys/hurts you and also let him know hes got making up to do!
LyR6DudNaa	yes, guys that are conceited and that are driven by the most popular would.Just to let people know that girls like him and there a wanted person.But most guys would take it seriously, and keep it between you and him.  Hope that helped!|`|JRpD7Yu5aa	Guys that are still living in Jr. High would. Its a maturity thing.|`|wlfFqSp8aa	never
frDi9Sbwaa	He's either just being really nice (I have guys doing that kind of stuff for me that are good friends or being nice) or he is interested. From the examples here, it doesn't seems like he's in love with you but he does seem to like you.
Tj2xROpwaa	Probably a scene or emo kind of guy. by the way, I dig your hair :)|`|GmGogzsXaa	prep maybe jock?|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Lolicon lover?
HMg97Fxjaa	Distance relationships are the hardest, but usually the best. Every love is going to involve some heartache, so just keep things going strong, and when you do hang out with him, act as if it's your last time ever seeing him, because really, who knows when you'll see him next when he gives excuses 75% of the time. I wish you the best of luck :)|`|coiKYeVGaa	You could try to talk to him without sounding too desperate. Explain that you miss him and you feel like you never get to talk much. Be completely honest with him and let him know how you feel, but don't sound obsessive.     I've found that it's impossible to keep a relationship with someone who is not giving equally, not putting into it as much as you are. And if you love someone, as sad as it is, set them free. If they come back, then it is love. if they leave, they were never yours to begin with.|`|veby4afmaa	I am playing that same role myself and it is rough!  Any other person I would have ended the relationship,  But if you know you have meet that one special person the struggle with be worth it.|`|D8bTsWr8aa	Just try to work things out with him. Good luck!|`|7pFVHdssaa	Let it be, sound like he is change of heart.|`|l3b0hjdWaa	Get a grip.  You sound so clingy and dependent.  No one wants to kiss a leech.  If he really cared about you, he wouldn't be making excuses not to see you. In fact, he would be trying to see you whenever he could. It doesn't seem like he's that interested in you anymore and you just sound like you need to learn how to be independent before you start depending on someone.|`|cQiNs0yRaa	there is a chance he is getting stress by the change of school  but it seems to me he is too confused to be in a relationship right now    you might want to keep your relationship intact  but he's got to want it too and try for it too    this has been stressful to you too, but you don't avoid him , right?  so I believe you must confront him about this  and if he tells you he is stressed  then give him a little time and space  and if he loves you he 'll eventually return to you|`|5115bb62cfc070cc9dcb561cbdd49549aa	try making things more interesting, change things?  talk more, and get him to hangout, and show him a good time :)
mKIA6V4Saa	Never.  It's been proven to be genetically impossible through study after study.|`|aymBTRlyaa	Ask them. Plus, it's not all about looks, sweetie.|`|XILJOxbTaa	im a redhead and im part irish. i dont have an irish accent but it seems to me that guys dont really care about hair color. you just have to have the right clothes to compliment your body type, eyes, hair color, and personality|`|i7rYRvlTaa	well who knows?   you would have to ask them|`|hMMU02iuaa	Hair color shouldn't matter. It's the person beneath the physical :)|`|LLeQyWGcaa	what's the difference, it's the head that's attached to the hair that really counts.|`|utTTwlataa	no kause no one likes gingers|`|0Zr1FAVNaa	how am i supposed to know?|`|ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Why wouldn't they go for a ginger girl.  SOme of the most beautiful girls in the world are redheads.  I should know I am one!|`|SdMF993Daa	Do you really think anyone on this website would know who these "ginger fellas" would like?|`|UPN3zqq6aa	everyone has different tastes  i love red hair = )|`|Z03zgM0maa	Maybe you should dye your hair black...just kidding. I would, if they attract me enough. As long as they take care of themselves they can have purple hair and I'd be fine with it.|`|JERUmEFzaa	They probably do.|`|8a42b6d9c2fd88b69c7a56faa2606594aa	Are you open to black men? Redhead girls are gorgeous.|`|IHwMbLX5aa	Everyones different. Depends on their preferences as well.|`|W9VLXTfpaa	it dont matter, what YOU LIKE matters, i could really give a **** waht people think who belongs together.|`|xipapeHzaa	I do!  I couldn't care less about red-headed guys though, sorry.|`|MfUMaKcDaa	they go for whoever they like/love|`|RHllkmBpaa	:::::::::::P its an alien|`|AA11595360	i dunno but i do... redheads ROCK!!!|`|uiO590WJaa	it's haley williams! look at her red hair! it's SHOCKING!    EDIT* Sorry for those of you who don't get it, it's an insider    and to answer the question, i don't care about whether your hair is red if you have a nice body|`|yknbKCtbaa	i've heard ginger is very good for you!|`|qyc50A7eaa	Yeah, everyone goes for everyone. Nobody has a particular 'favorite' for what they go for, these things are usually environmental, as (no offence to redheads here) they're usually 'bullied' and that can affect a person's judgement.|`|SldrawoLaa	Well I'm redheaded to and most of my bf's have had red hair!  Plus in Ireland you have the Colleen look don't you?  And as i discovered new years eve the Irish lads like that lol!|`|pWoxMohbaa	Since redhead fellas are somewhat hard to come upon, I'm not really sure if most or even many at all are also interested in redheaded girls, but I do know that one of the few I know is also dating a redhead...and they make an adorable couple!  I'm sure there are plenty more ginger guys that absolutley love redheads.  =)|`|784651e1ee1eb844bbe54c4751d5c867aa	hi; i dont think we should stereotype gingers...Most might go for the redheads but some dont. There is no clear pattern on this. Just go for the one you like, if he likes you back, great! If not, move on for the next one...you should also consider brunettes everyonce in a while ;-) hehe|`|47oF1FCCaa	In the words of Richard Thompson "in my opinion, there's nothing in this world beats a '52 Vincent and a red headed girl."    If you don't know this song, look it up.  "Vincent Black Lightning"    You'll realize how fiery hot you are and whatever a ginger fella is, if he's not into you, he's probably playing for the other team.    Long Live Hot red-headed Irish lasses!!|`|4YK4tBW5aa	I'm not a redhead, but redhead girls are FINE....check out Annie Wersching from 24 -- red hair, freckles, and an absolutely perfect goddess.|`|UtrgRjTeaa	I don't know what ginger guys go for, because I'm not one. (Brown hair, gold eyes.) But frankly, I LOVE redheaded, Irish girls. So even if the ginger boys turn you down you can find guys that will love the way you look!|`|tcEFlV3Aaa	Heres my thoughts on redheads     there are no inbetweens your either very beautiful or really ugly,     sounds like you might be beautiful.|`|OvimFtImaa	it  doesnt matter the apparence.... good luck ?|`|YyFexhd3aa	for F U C K sake who in hell we gonna know|`|iU1FFAOzaa	so far so good with me.    i think that they r fascinated by us, thats when u allow them the chance to get to know you :)
4ICs8mnTaa	I personally would like a guy to wait after marriage cause then i feel that there is no pressure doing what i don't want to do.  Also sex shouldnt have a huge part in a relationship relationships should be based on personality and how well you two can communicate    dont feel obligated to have sex if you dont want to...if the girl wants to have sex and you dont want to then shes not worth your time if she wont respect your desicion :)|`|7GQuGVzmaa	To be honset i like virgin guys because they wouldn't force you into something u dont want to do.and in my opinan they are a bit more sweeter but thats my opinan everyones different.|`|uBssj3Znaa	No I prefer a man who knows what he is doing!|`|peRwevvVaa	Well I know a lot of woman want first~timers(|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	I don't like virgins|`|i7rYRvlTaa	i prefer them but everyone is different|`|coiKYeVGaa	I would prefer someone who knows what they are doing...  but yet, someone who wasn't stupid enough to have sex with 56748435 people and have STDs.  it's nice to have a middle ground.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	I think women would be much more at ease knowing they aren't competing with a dozen women from my past.     And as far as skill in bed....it's not difficult to have good sex. It might take a little practice, but if you're married, you've got the time.    Good Luck! Don't give in to temptation!!|`|5115bb62cfc070cc9dcb561cbdd49549aa	yeah i do, but just my opinion..|`|yr1xv9ohaa	I'm not saying this is what i like, but most of the time if she herslef is a virgin,that some girls like if a boy has a little experience, if she is not a virgin, then she might not mind.
xkMadpW5aa	there was this school election and i lost by like literally one vote and then i had to make this speech in front of the whole school and i must have looked really sad and i couldn't think of anything to say and then all of the sudden, my good guy friend (who i liked and still like) came all the way down through the bleachers and put his arm around me for the rest of my speech in front of the whole school. this teacher kept waving for him to go away but he just looked right at her and shook his head.      oh, and (SAME GUY!!!!) i was sick and he lives nearby so he brought me my homework, and i was like i don't know if i can do this, so he SAT THERE AND WROTE IN THE ANSWERS I TOLD HIM TO WRITE FOR AN HOUR EVEN THOUGH I TOLD HIM IT WAS OKAY!!! every five seconds i was like don't worry, i can do it, but he just kept doing it.|`|EANeX10Jaa	OOOOOOOOOOOOOOO    LALALALALALALALALALAL|`|AsFiWxhUaa	well my ex has a beach house so we spent some time down there and he cooked dinner and one morning we woke up and went to the beach to watch the sun rise it was not much but it was really sweet.|`|7GQuGVzmaa	well i was sick one day and i couldnt come to school.i had to go in this group thing where this guy i had a crush on was in.he offered to help me on the work and he gave me his seat.and one time i was really unwell at school he took me to the first aid.he was the sweetest guy i ever met but we go diffrent schools now :(|`|b6JNYeMoaa	When I was in college my boyfriend at the time invited me over.  He had me close my eyes when I got there and walked me into the bathroom.  There was some slow jazz playing in the background. He had the whole bathroom lit up with candles, there must have been 30 candles in that bathroom.  The bathtub (which was an old claw-footed tub), was filled and bubbly and there were two glasses of wine on the side.
ECjHm2YLaa	Ummm~that was a little vague but basing my answer of the gist of the question... no~that doesn't sound right.|`|xN5QDXMmaa	Yes. Chatting With someone does not mean you are going out with them.|`|xFm5wzuXaa	Then why would you do it?  That is so selfish and immature, as long as it makes you happy I guess you don't care.  See that is why I have a happy marriage and most people end up getting ten divorces good for them.|`|MfUMaKcDaa	well, it's not very nice.|`|J3lUKBKPaa	No just out of respect for your significant, put yourself in there shoes if there was something that made you feel unhappy or uneasy whatever and you asked them to please not do it would want want them to respect you or just go behind your back and do it anyway|`|afikujwmaa	No, that's whack.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Sorry do you mean chat as to someone on the computer. If so what is your partners objection? I often talk to other people male and female either via the computer or even in a social setting and my hubby would not even think to try and stop me. If she/ he is trying to control you and stop you socialising I think they are way out of line and need to get some help for the insecurities they obviously feel. Sorry if I have misunderstood the question and this is not what you meant. Yes marriage is hard work and it involves a great deal of give and take in response to some others who have answered why is it alright for her partner to try and stop her doing something she gets pleasure from then? and why is she on line answering questions which is a type of chat. My marriage has survived many painful incidents and not one of them has been as a result of my husband stopping me doing something I get pleasure from. Marriage is a PARTNERSHIP with both people having equal stakes in the relationship and Neither has the right to dictate how the other person should behave. He chose you and you chose him so he should remember that and stop thinking you are going to leave him just because you are talking to other people. Obviously if you are chatting to an ex partner it might be better to stop that than cause your partner pain but not just chatting to others you are not a slave to be told who you can and cannot talk to or how you can communicate with others. (sorry it makes my blood boil when I hear people say you have to do everything your partner says so you do not cause them upset just because you are a couple you both have equal rights, these same people are probably the ones who say they never argue with their partner why not are they so scared to disagree with what the partner says or so brain washed that they have to agree with everything and not even allowed the freedom of their own opinions) For the record I have some serious shouting matches with my husband normally over something stupid but then one of us sometimes me and sometimes him apologises and we have great fun 'making up' The most important piece of advice I have ever been given is never go to sleep angry with your partner. I rarely have and  we celebrate our 27 th wedding anniversary in february|`|3frIC80naa	yea thats bad . even if you dont see the other person you can get tricked in to thinking that you like that person and your partner can get hurt.|`|QCdpBqhHaa	You should respect your partner's wishes.  Why add any problems to your relationship?  And why would you want talk to someone else in the first place??  There's no point to it and it is wrong considering that it's obvious that this person has intentions by insinuating on "chatting" in person, not just email.|`|lHDq5gEraa	ur significant other should have no control over who u talk to. If you like this person and there your friend then talk to them....its not fair for you not to just because they don't like them.|`|5115bb62cfc070cc9dcb561cbdd49549aa	it probably would be better if you didn't.|`|3xgzwx6oaa	No have respect for your significant other...if they dont like them then have enough respect for their feelings to just stay away from them...just imagine if things were reverse...would you like them talking to someone you dont like...yeah!|`|FfeKzUycaa	It's not okay.  If you care more about chatting with someone you don't know than your significant other's feelings maybe you should reevaluate your relationship.  Sounds like either you like to be in control or you don't care about your partner.|`|jBk1b4r6aa	show your s/o some respect and don't do it.|`|fCB3pCXaaa	noo
AA10065812	Let me ask you, are you more mature than Christ was at your age? He was 30 before he was mature enough to make his own decisions and leave home.|`|WRIGLZjmaa	well you can ask this advice at jamrie.com  its more of a personal advice website.  people over there might be able to help you out.    i go there all the time!|`|qeQVyLW7aa	well if you leave she can say that you ran away if she doesn't agree with it or you can do what you said. social services. try telling your mother how you feel and if you have to live with her then you don't want to talk to her unless you need something. just try confronting her and see what she does. if that doesn't work do what you think is right.
6k8GJBRPaa	???   When you're not comfortable with it, that you should not do this. That's clear. And you don't have to be superstrong to dominate, you can also be smart ;-)|`|3frIC80naa	i think he might be gay. that's really odd for a Straight guy to say.
29I8PWrxaa	I know exactly what you are going through.  I dated my first love from when I was 15 til I was 21.  We talked about getting married when I was finished University.  Then, when I was in my second year, he suddenly broke up with me out of the blue and said he "needed space", "wanted to find himself", and "didn't want to date ANYONE right now, just wanted to be alone".  I was in complete shock and at first really didn't believe him.  I was at his house the next day thinking he was just mad the night before or something.      But when he didn't want to get back together, I was heartbroken. And the worst thing he did was he would leave that little glimpse of hope - that maybe we would get back together in the future because he still loved me.  I wish today that I would have just left him alone and listened to everyone telling me to move on, but that little glimmer of hope kept me coming back ... and we got back together and broke up three times before I finally got the message.  I ended up in the hospital emergency room having a nervous breakdown six months after the first breakup.    Please try to move on and don't worry about why he did it.  I know it's impossible to think about being with someone else after the breakup ... but it will happen.  Don't "wait for him" to take you back.  I was so lucky, I met my fiance six months after we broke up for the final time, and here we are engaged, two years after we met and three years after I broke up with my ex.  In a way, I think my ex used the excuse he did because it worked for him ... he had me waiting around for him for a while while he got to be single.      Good luck, and I hope you can move on and get over him.  I know it's hard, but someday you will meet some other guy who will love you as much as you love him, and who will not play games with you!|`|mvKDbb2uaa	It really just sounds like he wants to experience life.  You two have been together for a long time and he might feel like he's missed out on something.  In a way, when you get together younger you do miss out a little bit.    The best you can really do is to walk away and not push for anything.  It's tough, but it's really the only thing you can do.  Live YOUR own life because you owe it to yourself.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Let him go.    Keep your dignity (no sex for him), get on with your life (find friends to do things with) and don't let him know how much he's hurt you.      He wants to find out what single life is all about.  He's never experienced it because he's been with you for 7 years and he wants to know what's "out there."    Let him find out what's out there for a broke guy who's just finishing college.    If/when he comes crawling back with his tail between his legs, you will have to decide if you want him back.|`|nqINitkmaa	I don't know him and I don't know his true feelings. Maybe he is just stressed out and this is his way of dealing with it, tell him that after 7 years he owes it to you to sit down and talk about it, meet for coffee some where to talk about it, and tell him how you feel, if he still gives you the same answers, as hard as its going to be fore you you need to move on. I am so sorry you feel this way and I know that breakups can be very hard, but there is life after your break up and you can get through it! Good Luck!|`|h6NqNzHAaa	Sounds to me like he wants to have more experiences in life. You have been together for an awfully long time and he may feel like he missed out on some things,|`|b328a9d35b4d38f11fb5ea37fe0b727aaa	Move on. This comes from someone who has been in the same situation as you in many ways. My graduate school boyfriend swore he loved me and said he "didn't want to need anyone." We had talked about marriage, etc. We broke up and in less than a year, he was dating someone else.     Honestly, I am now married and am glad that I didn't end up with him, though it tore me apart back then for quite a while. I know it is difficult, but there will be another guy and honestly, he will probably be better than this guy by far.    Good luck. It takes a long time to heal, but trust me, it is worth it once you find the right guy.|`|RKsn5dD4aa	Wow, I'm so sorry.  But it sounds like he was being sincere.  I think you should "go find yourself" experience new things.  Learn what it's like to be single.  Good luck.  If it's met to be it will be.|`|040cc8058073c5410e0b3be5a2068a42aa	As hard as this may sound... walk away. He wants out and it is best to just stay away. Focus on what YOU are going to do for yourself, think of it as a do-over. Unfortunately it sounds like he has already moved on, the excuses he used are the same ones they all use when they are wanting to move on. Break free and do something for yourself! If you hold on you will be breaking up for the next year. Let him go and work on you!|`|ZVcFFeEoaa	He probably just wants space since you've been together for so long. Or he could be telling the truth about ''finding himself''. Plus now a days FOREVER is over rated. You shouldn't expect that from any man.
goP5E0Kxaa	Guy friends are sometimes as stupid as the guy if not worse. I wouldn't take what they are saying to heart.    Even if it was said, I doubt that he really meant it when he said it.    I once had a crush on a black woman, she was forward, and showed an interest , and I would soooo have dated her if I wasn't a shy guy, and if I was not blind to the signs that she liked me . I was so close to dating her, but years of being alone kept me alone.    From personal experience, show him you are interested and you will at least get enough attention to be confused by him.|`|D5NkT1dUaa	who cares about race?   hmm..   i think if you really like him try to hang out with him and get to know him better, and then ask him out:)  tell him how much you like him.  hopefully he will feel more comfortable with you!|`|eVK2zZsOaa	Instead of letting your friends talk to him, you should talk to him. That is the first problem right there. Why are your friends to speaking to him on your behalf? If you know that he is shy, then you are going to have to make the first move. Just go right up to him and let him know how you feel. Don't come on to strong....but go up to him and let him know or just strike up conversation about something and the rest will fall into place. Just ask him has he seen the latest movie(name a movie, any movie) and that might spark up a conversation that leads to a date.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	Funny, I don't consider being Indian black.  Brown maybe but not black and I've seen a lot of really beautiful Indian women in my time.  If he's shy then there's your problem.  You need to approach him a little at a time but never give up.  He just needs a little coaxing if you ask me (and you did).  He might be a little racist, it's hard to tell without really knowing him.  Just take it slow and get in good with him then see what happens.    Hope this helps, good luck.|`|izbAdDUraa	Talk to him! it would blow his mind. :]  tell him you like him.. or ask him out.. ask for his number.. etc.   make the first move, girl.  and who cares about race?! its all good.
pVnUhYLQaa	not for the guy|`|Uaoep16Qaa	hurt me a lot|`|J5Mevbz7aa	not at all|`|i7rYRvlTaa	yeahh.|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	It hurt soooooooooooooo much I didn'r have it again for 1 yr.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	For the girl yes but it helps if you take it very slowly and he needs to listen to her because when she says stop, he must stop inserting it and stop all motion until she is ready.  Anyone that tells you it doesn't hurt has either had sex before or they are lying to you.  I've been with three virgins and every one of them hurt the first second and third time we had sex although it hurt less each time.    A lot of girls who says it doesn't have been molested as a child and put it out of their memory.  I know one girl who her parents told her she hit the tailgate of a truck so hard it broke her hymen.  this was a total lie.  There is no "hit" a girl can receive to break that hymen, only penetration.  She had been molested as a very young girl by her father and they didn't tell her.  It's also why she liked older men.    Hope this helps.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	I didn't feel any pain when I did it! :)|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	um it depends, really!     it didnt hurt me at all. . . it was actually enjoyable. but my friend was in so much pain that she cried.   if you are scared its going to hurt make sure you do lots of foreplay and have lube nearby just in case!|`|QLe4U0baaa	No.  All the people who say it dose are the people who are being stuck up daddy's little girls who say you should wait and have sex. they are trying to scare you out of it.  IT DOSE NOT HURT|`|OQ5ch42Aaa	For the guys no but for the girls yes.The first few times hurt but then you'll love it.|`|oM7bXmkvaa	Yes, it hurts like hell!  Well for a girl it hurts, boys don't get hurt.|`|4kcXEwtTaa	Wel lsex is a special thing but yeah to be honest it does hurt to me it hurt like hell but it depends on your hymen/cherry whateveryou call it my hymen was thick so it hurt worse but to can find outhow thick or thin it is by looking in a mirror .....if youwant to break it yourself you can do so by riding your bike or fingering yourself PS there's other things but I don Believe they work by i hope this helps:)|`|GzYtIbizaa	WELL it would depend on how relaxed you are when you are having it. if you are tensed then yes. when you are tensed it makes it harder for the guy to put it in with ease thus making it hurt. if you are relaxed it loosen you up making it easy for the guy to glide on in.so just remember when you are having sex to be relaxed, cool ,calm, and really wet.LOL|`|ZVTcZTwcaa	like allot told u depends on the person|`|TJMbnEoTaa	a lot of people say it does.  but it didn't hurt me.|`|5115bb62cfc070cc9dcb561cbdd49549aa	depends on the person..|`|SldrawoLaa	Girls Yes  Guys No|`|S6tRZlKAaa	Depends on various factors such as nerves, lubrication, amount of foreplay etc. =)    Myself I was in quite a lot of pain at first, but my boyfriend slowed down and talked to me which made it stop hurting after a minute or so.  For some people it can hurt the next couple of times as well, but for most it shouldn't be unbearable.|`|KHsWu1zbaa	Didn't hurt me. Depends if you've torn the hymen before hand. If you have, sex won't hurt. If you haven't, yes you'll feel a bit of pressure and then a tearing feeling.|`|7BRJhrABaa	my girlfriend just told me to write that "it doesnt hurt that u just feel a little pain when it goes in" blah word @ this question..ya'll girls r some elsee|`|wkCVY6kBaa	Yes, the first time is usually more painful then pleasurful|`|b1e77b2aab8ad2bca3a05a7936c3211caa	for me it did. It was pretty painful but my boyfriend was pretty big and i was nervous.  It all depends tho. ive heard for some girls it doesnt hurt at all.|`|rmmNS689aa	some ppl say it does   some ppl say it doesn't|`|HMg97Fxjaa	Pssh, guys have it easy. It hurts for girls on the first time.|`|Q8WX4Jopaa	it depends on the size of the guy. if he's big it does if he's not it probably won't hurt.|`|kiIqpZ18aa	yes. it hurts like hell. well at least for me it did.  i jumped and screamed.  it wasnt pleasurable at all but after a couple times. it feels good!!  i have friends who say they didnt feel a thing!!|`|TP5hXhVDaa	May be a little weird, awkward.  You need to make sure that you are physically and mentally ready to take on an adult act, like this.     I found this website with a letter addressing you issue, hopefully it will help.  There are a lot of mature words used in the letter, I do not want to paste it, might offend someone reading.    http://www.teenwire.com/ask/2007/as-2007...|`|quGOimZ1aa	it didnt hurt me ONE bit  but.. i did bleed a little..
o0tor5XPaa	I think that he has some kind of interest in you, and he probably does like you,  and mayb it's that he's not sure how the relationship would end at as since ya only talk on the phone and online....dont think he has no type of interest because (though guys sometimes do things with out reason) it is clear that he injoys talkin to you and spending his time on you, :)|`|fCB3pCXaaa	yes|`|UUQpz0Iuaa	Yeah he is showing a lot of interest in you or he could be  just a charmer and like that to all girls but  i think there is something there.|`|yknbKCtbaa	I think he's either trying to get into your pant(ies) or just full of hot air.|`|REZesQpLaa	Awww how cute he is crushing on you|`|o298GAKcaa	well i had a friend that was just like that and we are now in a relationship its been a year and four months we were best friends always their together and we are now in love so his prbery waiting for your move my boyfriend did .|`|UPN3zqq6aa	sounds tome he really likes you and he probably would wana go out with you but would be quite difficult cz of the disance.  x|`|3ec8db48c982309c568e30839db0072eaa	he has at least some interest in you   guys are too lazy to put fourth that much effort into a girl if he doesn't care for her if you 2 really talk that much why dont you bring it up to him he sounds understanding and whats the worst thing that could happen it might be a lil awkward but you 2 will get over it lol|`|8vfCRg7Caa	sure, guys need friends too. And women aren the only sex that likes to search out their feeling so we can understand whats going on. Online is never a way to tell if anybody likes you, let alone a guy. We hide our feelings in person well, and online, hell, we pretty much do the oppisite of what we feel. So id say if you truly want to know how he feels. Spend some time with him. No easy way about it. Just cause he stays up late at night means nothing. I stay up and night and if im up at night ill talk to some women. Theres a girl now that chats with me on facebook that id puke if she asked me out on a date. You have to meet in person. Only way you can tell. After a couple times out, you will know.    I see you spent time but it really doesnt sound like the one on one time that really matters.|`|YyFexhd3aa	will maybe he likes you but the long distance relationship make him confuse|`|M7r7gHNGaa	It sounds as though he likes you a friend. It is so much easier for people to open up and chat when it's online because it's safer. It's safer because your not face to face you can say anything and if one of you gets huffy about something it is a simple matter to log off.    Just be friends and have fun. Don't push for anything else; if it develops into something else it won't be forced.|`|nI2KSsrqaa	Idk, he could like you..I was best friends with my boyfriend for four years before we started dating, and its amazing. After a couple days of dating he admitted that he liked me the entire four years, and I liked him to but everytime one of us were single the other one was taken..I would take a chance and just ask him, Who knows he could.|`|PSvc3sLdaa	Just a friend srry|`|BopBYwSdaa	sound like he likes you but have a chance of heart for some people think distance beat love    I don't believe in that (but sure travel cost a lot) and hard work to make long distance relationship work|`|26Auv91iaa	He does like you but doesnt really want a long distance relationship so he doesnt know what to do.|`|omCOMXqOaa	i think he does if he talks to you that much
AA11309717	texting and talking on the phone are nice but to really get to know someone you need to spend face to face time together. irealize you spent 6 weeks dating but truly have you ever seen him when he is mad? Have you ever seen him when he's depressed or down? My point is until you spend time with a person over an extended period of time you really can't love a person..    Likely you are infatuated, which is ok, but it's not really love|`|mAZi1eH7aa	You like him, the situation is intriguing, and somewhat out of the norm. That makes it a temptation. But you can never love someone without knowing their personal idiosyncrasies and faults and accepting them as not bothering you. This can ONLY be done by personal contact and time spent together over a period of time. You can not rationally fall in love on line, without ever meeting. It is an impossibility. Do not deceive yourselves. You will regret it. Right now you are operating on what has been said, mixed with what has been imagined. The combination will surely lead to a large degree of disappointment when the truth and imaginings of the mix becomes vague and assumptions are made and dashed and the reality is faced.  I would hope that you are smarter than that.|`|D24Npt4eaa	I speak everyday to someone I've never met.  I"M NOT IN LOVE.  I like the person very much.    You don't know a person really well till you've lived with them and even then knowing more and more about someone can make or break the relationship.    With that being said, knowing a person in person is a much better way to judge if you're really in love with them.  Only time will tell.      Good luck
WDs4fRoxaa	It is better to turn yourself in and make bail now, than to  get married, get pregnant, and then get caught.    Best wishes|`|u4NXQkq7aa	depends where u live now and what the warrent is for hey crimanals get married every day ... i was and got divorced lol  now just single and loving it ha ha ha|`|d20mM90uaa	anything is possible!!!! why not just turn yourself in   you can't run forever|`|e138b4efa4524e74d6719f0ebf966a81aa	you could why not fess up do the time for your crime and live a happy marrage with the wife|`|PvAIY7OPaa	Why do u need the hassle of marriage license unless the woman or man you are marrying is loaded with money and if that is the case tell him/her to pay the warrant off otherwise enjoy life without the stress of marriage.|`|SiniSj1eaa	if you have a warrant in mo..they will do whatever it takes to find you.     I dated a guy once when I lived there and they caught him by utility records..    it really depends if its a felony warrant or a warrant for a parking ticket im sure.    I just know that the state of MO is not very tolerable of warrants...go to Nebraska or something..its cheaper there anyways haha.|`|N2sr8xX9aa	it depends on what the warrant is for.  The warrant can be served if the charge or Crime is enough to take you back to the place of issue.  It appears you need to belly up and handle the warrant anyway.          Mildred is my leader|`|pOCabUMvaa	What goes around, comes around, you can run, but you can't hide!!!!    Just turn yourself in.|`|Aw30AtP7aa	Depending on how long ago the warrant was issued it might not even be valid. I used to be a crimminal lawyer so any questions or concerns you have just shoot me an email: floridarobbie@gmail.com.    Also, when I got married all we had to do was show ID, no background checks were done.|`|1HTRWrawaa	You can run, but you can't hide. You did the crime, maybe it's time to man up and do your time. There is no future with a person who is running from the law. If you love someone, you don't drag them through your mess.
Ot1R3t5uaa	what a waste of a drink. the sentence will depend on your previous. if you are clean,then you will probably get a small fine and have to give her a small amount of compensation. this will probably amount to around 500 ish.you may get a couple of hundred hours community service instead of the fine.if you have previous then it will get worse for you depending on your record. if you do have a record,be prepared for holiday care of her majesty!|`|KO4Ea9Xkaa	My ex husband got a 125 fine (but he is unemployed) and had some sort of supervision order on him for 6 months (basically meaning he had to behave until a certain date or he would go to prison). He had previous for drunk and disorderly, assault, and assaulting a pc.  You can see why he's my ex.
TXCoUGgpaa	I think it's pretty awesome. I like how you refer to Florida as America's Wang. Anyway, you seem to have put a lot of your self into it. Plus you don't come across as shallow or stupid, so I'd say you're good. The pictures are awesome. It's swank approved.|`|kt774vEraa	Cute!|`|aupBzZGfaa	i don't like it too much...  i think you should get a layout where the left and right colums are like attached.... like a default layout... i think those look the best...|`|ddWyRjmVaa	i like the pic when your on the bike and no shirt. lol hahaha.  i think the profile is okay,, but its kinda dull|`|nLiCiRnSaa	wtf swank? its pretty cool other than that.   and when you open yourself to other peoples' criticism shouldn't say shut up to them...even if they don't like it.|`|COmp4sIuaa	....2 points|`|nstz1Lkeaa	'swank' ? yea its not bad i like the background pic and u have a couple good songs on there|`|4XCg1mIMaa	Okay it looks kinda like you are trying to sell something for a commercial...kinda gay too....sorry, don't mean to offend you though...just telling my honest opinion.|`|vj2pWs9Maa	Why did you ask for opinions, then bag all of them?  I'm not going to give you my honest opinion, because apparently you don't want honest opinions....  Thanks for the 2 points though.
UrNMuhFKaa	The truth will hurt for a little while but then your mom will respect you for standing up and taking responsibility.  Do the hard thing - do the courageous thing. You will be glad you did later and proud of yourself.   It's a crossroad in your development of your character - choose the high road.|`|KjY2pANcaa	shes going to disown you|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Better you fess up and tell her what happened.  She'll be mad, but not quite as mad as if she were to find out you lied to her.|`|2rG7rYOWaa	haha.  U'll probably be spending all of ur time on here for the next few months and not by choice. lol|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	You got to tell her baby girl...this is one situation that u can not get out of...she has to know how u did it...trust me your mom has insurance on the car...she needs to call them so they can fix the damages...there is no other way out of this..Sorry....u got to swallow what she gives u...rather it's being grounded or pay her back each week till the bill is paid off..(thats if u have a job)|`|6SxVuHjNaa	ur stupid no lisence watta heck is the matter with u but pay up before she notice it or get grounded until u have the money to pay it|`|92fbce946753f473dafcf78d171f5a2baa	who goes to a party on  a monday nightt? lmaoo well uhm tomorooww wake up before her and when she wakes up tell her calmy and explain yourslelf. maybe not about the party part though, if you wake her up rigght now while shes tiredd, shell be even more angry at you for 1. crashing her car and 2. waking her up.  goood luck!|`|ohi0kM6Raa	bite the bullet, baby.  you f*cked up, now you gotta pay up.|`|a95e6422ed636e86d21c41cf555820beaa	Just tell her! She'll be mad of course, but she's gonna find out. She might as well find out from you. Show her that you are REALLY sorry. Be humble and take your punishment. She'll come arround I'm sure of it.|`|0e88c2210c8510ae47dbd15b433d18a8aa	well you are going to have to tell her the truth and suffer the punishment she gives you.|`|LiTMU2Dhaa	the fence just came out of no where. Haha! Don't tell her that!  Just tell her you're so sorry and will take whatever punishment she decides to give you.|`|pJpk1aXFaa	well dont plan on getting your license till your married (if you make it)|`|Yy28UP2aaa	Ha! I did that once but to my friends mom's car!! I din't tell and the guy I hit was young and pretty cool. He let me pay out the damage to his car and we never told my friends mom what happened, she thought she got hit in the parking lot. But I still feel guilty about it, so maybe you should just fess up and tell your mom!|`|fAN2DQJyaa	Lol, this happened to my brother just the other week. Man i feel for you. But as long as you don't have an abusive mother I think you should just tell her the truth and get it over with.     It was your fault to begin with so be a man. When you took your mom's car, it was your responsibility to keep it safe but you didn't. So take this punishment and learn from it. Don't do it again and be careful next time.|`|1Zlw8C8vaa	that your a complete dumbass|`|pV189Op2aa	youre screwed! s h i t gurl
jexo0Nmzaa	I REALLY would ask her out.  I'm in the exact same situation with a guy right now and I wish he would ask me out because I'm too shy.    Usually the girl is just waiting for the guy. And so what if you have one awkward night? It will get better, you just  need to spend some time alone and get to know each other!    Good Luck =)|`|BiNCwoOiaa	personally i say ask her out and if she says we need to get to know each other better then just start talking to her and become friends and then eventually ask her out after some time again|`|AA10879212	ASK HER OUT! you've got nothing to lose! you cant not date her any more than you're already not dating her! but ask her to dinner or something where you can talk, cuz if you go see a movie at a theatre, you cant talk, and if thats her issue, than thats no good. unless you want to invite her to your house for a movie with a movie you both really love or something, cuz that can give you guys something to talk about and laugh about, and get to know each other over.  She'll say yes to you, and maybe you can make a joke about how you really wanna talk and get to know her.|`|98XExOmqaa	if you like her then ask her out. if you don't you may always be sorry you didn't. i know it's scary but you have to try. if she says no then you can stop driving yourself crazy over it........but she might say yes. you don't want to find out later that she was waiting for you to ask her out but you never did. go for it. good luck|`|8uNLDeLQaa	hey i so liked this guy and we flirted until he asked me out she might fill the same way you wont know until you ask|`|CBYFTjXHaa	askk herr!!        noww.|`|kpPOzMpeaa	ask her to go play like mini gold with you and a couple of friends (another guy and girl). but make sure that the guy you invite doesn't like her. haha. that would be akward. and..mini golf is a great way to get to flirt with her. =)|`|H1UzYl8haa	ask her to go to the movies (on a secret kinda date)  start being not overly affectionate but give her certain looks and smile alot, make her feel so comfortable and relaxed  any girl knows that when a guys acting sweet and caring that she diggs him  just take her out and she will bring it up herself, put your arm around her and everything, if she pulls back then you obviously know she's not interested and dosnt feel that way again    guud luck sweatie|`|WZCEvWKIaa	Yes. Just ask her. If you don't, you might miss your chance. A lot of girls will lose interest in someone who doesn't step up to the plate.|`|fTxwKBNBaa	Sure.  If she says "no" you'll have a love story to tell you grandchildren when you are old : ..|`|mvaPdekPaa	YES!!! ASK HER!!! or atleast get her number, thts wat phones are for.|`|pQxuivYaaa	If she said that you don't talk enough, that probably means she wants you to ask her out. So do it. But it doesn't have to be a movie... I hate movie dates because you sit around with someone for a couple hours but you can't really talk.|`|mFkfJwLOaa	ask her out, BUT dont go to a movie, your not supposed to talk during a movie so go for a walk in the park, or go out to dinner|`|9DV26vk0aa	jsut ask her|`|7xFa3afiaa	Ask her, but not to a movie, because you don't talk in movies. Ask her for a drink or something small so you can either go your separate ways after the drink, or, if things go well, head out or some food afterwards.    Believe it or not, girls are human and are likely to be just as nervous as you are.|`|dDgwMinYaa	I think you should ask her.  You never know, she might be waiting for you to make a move.  And try to avoid asking her out while she's with a group of friends, it makes it hard on her because she's worried about what they think instead of her.
JeNN7ZNqaa	ask her where she wants to go.|`|sTqfKpbraa	well go to some known place  dont do experiments and let him decide  that will work wonders|`|3kydegQJaa	NOT FAST FOOD!  But no where fancy either.  A first date should be fun, and comfortable.  Save the fancy places for celebrations.  I don't know where you live, but if there's like a cute little place by the beach or something, that would be awesome because the water tends to make people relax, which is great for talking and getting people to open up.  And walking or sitting on the beach afterwards will give you plenty of talk time.|`|RdatK8wlaa	Olive Garden or Red Lobster would be nice. Even Applebees.  Just ask her!|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	How about a park under a huge tree but strictly not within the bushes.|`|OOptQPnFaa	try a pinic in the park(if its warm) or possibly just driving around town blasting music and talking then find a lil cafe like a coffee shop take her in get some coffee or tea w/e sit down and dicuss ur interstes its wrked for me with my guys. good luck!|`|AA10420187	Bowling! skating!! Fair!|`|7975768afc30ab732d41bba7e2ea3a52aa	Is there like a Miniature golf place. Maybe horseback riding? Have fun!

IPlvWyDFaa	He is cheating on you - possibly physically, and certainly emotionally. You have two choices - either put up with it or tell him to stop and be prepared to leave (or have him leave) if he doesn't.|`|Z0VvcKCraa	It seems like he is hiding something.  The biggest clue would be either the way he goes into the bathroom with the lap top and doesn't say anything to you about it or the way he has a lot of sms from girls on his cellphone.  One of the biggest signs of a cheater is when he gets mad that you are asking him a question.  They quickly become angered because they are nervous and fear you'll figure them out, while an honest person will explain to you why they do the things they do while maintaining their composure.|`|y8mRKy2vaa	Tell him if it does not stop you are gone!!|`|5ILdSx7faa	Yes ask for a divorce at once.|`|oj6wQULCaa	It seems like he is hiding something.

And see if you can talk it out.  If he doesn't come clean or you think he is lying, maybe he is hiding something from you.  It might not be necessarily bad, but secrets can hurt a relationship.|`|S3UxNOhdaa	He is a cheater. You don't have to ask him for anything. If you are fed up with him, just go file for divorce.|`|nfl9xrLFaa	The problem abut such men is they never change. It's very foolish to carry a laptop to the bathroom...and it sounds like hes a pervert.Wht does he hav to share with other women in the bathroom that he cannot with u??? Just leave that jerk pervert and get on with ur life.He seems to be addicted to other women and nothing is going to get better as days go by.Some men would throw tantrum even before confronting them..I hav my own personal experience.U deserve better than him! leave him and take care of ur life..
sEUnAmv6aa	see if he will go to AA meetings and go to an outpatient.|`|WXCa8zQoaa	tell him that he is breaking his mothers heart and that it was your dads dieing wish to see him stop drinking make sure you talk to your grandma and support her so she at least has you|`|Z0KQenm9aa	you cant. you can pray... receive Jesus and ask the Holy Spirit to teach you and help you... go to a church that teaches the whole bible. the bible says that if you will say with your mouth jesus is lord and believe in your heart god raised jesus from the dead you will be saved... this means that the very same nature of God will be put into you and this is the power of God to enable you to live your life according to Gods plan... God will talk to you through your brand new spirit. by doing this you will be useful to your uncle and the holy spirit can work on him... go to daveroberson.org and listen to the series... the born again trail
KKcQWycGaa	Hi Suez,   it sucks how greedy people are willing to steal and cheat. Same thing happen to my mom with a beautiful acreage she inherited in Poland.  I would consult a lawyer specializing in this field, look up some of his/her cases ( in Quebec this is easily accessible-  imagine its the same where you are ).  I'd ask the lawyer to agree to be paid a certain capped percentage,  ( say,...x% or z$ ) of what you recover, ( you don't want lawyers fees   to devour your entitlement ), or a fixed amount ONLY if you win your case.  Good luck, I wish u well.  Hank|`|QrUKErYAaa	omg you should totally sue|`|F0d2W9Zyaa	Go to her house with a baseball bat and knock some teeth out.       LOL just kidding    Sue the bit** for all your trouble.  shes evil|`|Wu4NFg3maa	Who drew up the will? They would have a copy.     Sounds like your name was never on the property. Sounds like your Aunt had rights of survivorship on the deed and the whole property would go to her & her heirs when your grandmother died. It sounds like the property was hers to give away.     Were your names on the deed & then you took them off when your Aunt's name went on? If a lawyer has looked into the title and it was clear for your Aunt to give it to her children then it sounds like you are out of luck.     Find the will or you'll just spend good money trying to punish them.|`|SQj8bZ38aa	Hi Suez,  It sounds like a big mess. You say your grandma put money towards the property you live on. You never stated if the property was ever in your name, I take it, it wasn't. In that case, your aunt put it in her name after lieing to you about inheritance tax, if thats so , I think your gonna lose in court, sorry to say. You should have no problem getting a copy of her will.  As for telling these people off, I'll help ya. I had my dad die when i was 19, his sister and brother in law came over to our farm and took all my dads tools. Reason they had was stuipid, they said they were afraid me and my 20 year old brother would probably burn down the machine shed if we used dads welder{ what a joke } anyway God will see to it greedy people like this will pay one day. I myself could never be greedy, I can't stand to see people hurt or go without. I guess thats why I survuve from week to week and spend my money on my kids ,St judes childrens hospital kids and animals.  Anyway keep your chin up suez and be proud of who you are, at least good honest people can look thierself in the mirror and be prod of what we see { even if we are getting older and more wrinkles }  Terry B|`|xN5QDXMmaa	You must look after yourself and make sure you can live comfortably. You have a right to that. If that means sueing them go ahead.|`|fFe75M3Baa	Sucks to say, but in a situation like this, I would sue. This is not someone stealing a $25 shirt. Good Luck. Get a good lawyer.|`|1xySOaTeaa	That's not right, sue them. If your grandmother wanted you to have that property, your aunt can't just steal it from you when no one is looking! And plus, she's your AUNT!|`|xeBO8Mjcaa	I'd probably make the offending relative disappear.|`|cd5eb0e9ec80482bed5491827a61e262aa	I would sue for everything they stole from me and then for pain and court fees.  I would treat them like any other person that wasn't family that stole something from me. You can't think of her as family now because if you do, then she will continue to take advantage of you. You do not want that.  After you sue for everything then you could sue for court fees.      There should be a copy of your grandmothers will and tell them what she did to you as far as deceiving you and how she knew of what was on your grandmothers will and took the property from you without you knowing.      the court could make her show proof of the will in fact shouldn't her lawyer have a copy of the will because it had to get notarized to be legal and binding. If so then this case is yours, you aunt would not have a chance at winning this case.
ey6n5Od0aa	i say to him ,  im hyper lets eat ice cream and even wen hes in a bad mood and it is cold outside he will still take me to get icecream :)  then i flick icecream at his face and he tells me y hes pissed off :)|`|rN0b4jWHaa	Hmmm just ask him whats wrong and tell him u want to know how he feels because u care.

iPNOVR6Gaa	Of course it was a big mistake.  But if you learn this lesson, and truly take it to heart, this will all have been worth it: mean what you say, and say what you mean.|`|803c63e1bdfd226d14f4e5cafdc52f7eaa	You can't play with people like that...I want you, no I don't, yes I do, no I don't. Leave him alone. He's avoiding you which is safe to say he wants nothing to do with you.|`|KeRbiNKeaa	You ended it so you need to move on and get over it. Maybe after a cool down period he will stop avoiding you and you can talk to him.|`|xDaesbudaa	You're already calling him "ex."  Did you notice that?  Not enough details here to help you determine if you did the right thing.|`|N2sr8xX9aa	I am sure this was not a very quick thing in the breakup,,therefore it will take time to heel.  Do not add pressure.            Mildred is my leader|`|bgkqOx2yaa	He already know that you want him back but he is punishing you for what did and after that either he reacts or just was not in love with you. Just leave him alone for awhile and let him call you back if he does then you know that he was really in love and after he calls you should just apologize once and get back with him. Good luck!!!!!!  ***MILDRED IS MY LEADER***|`|pOCabUMvaa	Give him time, do not call him, do not do anything to get him back, if he wants to come back, it is up to him to make that decision.    You should not have spoken so soon if you did not really mean what you said, now you regret it.    Big mistake.    There is a saying that everyone knows, "if you love something, let it go, if it comes back to you, it is yours, if it does not, then it never was yours to begin with".    I suggest you learn this saying.    It is so true.    Maybe next time, you will not be so fast to say things you will regret later.|`|YFqUGRuGaa	I second Misty's thoughts.     One more thing, I am sure you are pretty short tempered. Ma'm, relationships need a lot of patience. you need to give him time and just start avoiding him too. If he comes back, do not repeat the same mistake. If he does not come back, think that you have messed it up big time and you do not repeat it next time you get a chance. It might also be the case that, your 'ex' is rigid and he does not seem to accept his mistake. If this is the case, forget him.
n926icjvaa	Gee, this brings back memories of school!  So exhausting!  I used to hate school relationships, because I always hated the cycle.  *You have a crush on a guy  *finally he asks you out  *You hold hands during lunch. All your friends give you 'alone' time  *You wait for him to kiss you  *Finally he's about to kiss you and the lunch bell goes  *Gotta wait till tomorrow to see if he'll kiss you  *After a couple of weeks, you break up when the relationship doesn't work out  *You don't talk to eachother for ages  *eventually you're friends again    So my rule at school was : Flirt & be 'one of the guys', but never date anyone at School!    It's way more fun flirting, than dating a guy anyway.    (And, no, I didn't turn out to be 'easy', surprisingly enough) :)|`|jSBtdhf0aa	i think you are confusing him also tell him how you really feel about him.|`|bzbH2C1Aaa	yeah ask him out trust me this happens at my skool all the time trust me he will like u straight away you are stunning|`|9RqmSgFKaa	My "Give -A-Crap" meter just pegged out.|`|8Od0gV7saa	Boys have their happy days with you and then we have the "who are you? days"    we basically do this so we wont get bored from you|`|nGGDddyUaa	ask him if he likes you... be blunt about your feelings sometimes    guys can be very confusing... so i've heard|`|STPmyVw5aa	your right if you dont like just get that through his head, imean its your life if he dosn't like it, its too bad for him. and from the sound of it he dosnt sound all that great anyway|`|AwEspXiiaa	Uhh wow..  Just dont be friends if he is going to be  a penis pincher about it,|`|C7frzO9Jaa	seems like you're kinda young. 13 or 14 maybe? guys will always go for the pretty and popular girl. give it a few years, dont waste your childhood on boys. he's hot and cold with you bc thats the male genetic code. it doesnt go away, and i deal with it at age 18. hope i helped hun and good luck|`|ITxP16qZaa	hmm i think he might like you... but just go along with things... let it flow out of you naturally|`|eVK2zZsOaa	The two of you sound like you are playing games with each other. Maybe he got mad because you told him you liked him in a friend kind of way and he was hoping for more or maybe he likes the attention he is getting from you. If you like him stop playing and let him know. Go back and tell him that the email was from you. Don't focus on the other girl, make your move before she does and he ends up with her.|`|37PYnKr9aa	Be yourself and do what you want. What do you have to lose? You may look back 5 years from now and regret doing it. Forget about the popularity and rumor junk. Only you know what you want, so do it and if he doesn't say yes, who cares. He isn't right for you then. Take your time and have fun.|`|OadQW0btaa	Ok. heres what you got to do. First of all is she is really your friend she will understand, that you just can't help who you like. My friend dated a guy that i had a crush on forever and she didn't even like him. At first I was a little bit upset and than like 2 days later i got over it. No matter how much you like a guy your friendship is worth more so I really feel she will forgive you. So take a chance and let this guy know because it seems that he has the same feelings for you.. you never know what will happen :)|`|lxNn6NTSaa	Most guys like when girls are straight forward with them, that's how i am, but don't be to straight forward or you'll scare him off. Sounds confusing i know. But just be yourself and believe me, and all will be fine. Good luck.|`|VhrUtQc2aa	Well maybe he is up set about the roomers it does not just affect you it affects him also. Maybe when he read your note that it was all a big mistake he got up set because maybe he does like you and you did not tell him the truth why lie? well i think I understand when i was in high school I liked my friends brother and when it came valentines day what I did was I brought him this Teddy bear, rose and i wrote him a note telling him how I feel and i gave it to my friend to give to her brother at school at the end he opened the letter read it in front of all his mates and my so called friends including his sister was laughing and it embarrassed me every time he said hello after that i would give him a cold shoulder because he hurt me.    A this friend does not sound like a friend because a friend should not do these things that she did rumours can destry your life and other people liking you. At the moment dont tell him its you ask him questions? see what he teels you ask him if he likes a girl at school? and which girl he hates? which girl he maybe like a little? ask him questions you want to know and if he asked you whats your name tell him you are worried about him treating you like crape if you tell him your name and tell him i have seen you react at school from something and i saw your face angry. good luck|`|578e2f7a3fd2ad02982eaa05fbce0dc4aa	I think no|`|z9x5Epzpaa	you shouldnt have written that note because now he thinks there is no point in liking you anymore and he may give up on you. but yes you do have an equal chance against that girl|`|cN7eh7Tbaa	just tell him! who cares about what you friend will do! its your choice to go out with who ever! he probably likes u too since he shows all those lovely dovey signs. but tlel him u like him and have HIM ask you out! never the girl!! neverrrrrr!!!!!!!! hope i helped! oh and if he asks who the email is from! just tell him! its from you! :) c ya girly!|`|5bq2Viixaa	Okay, I am a guy haha my name sound geeky (nickname) but you should ask him out for sure!|`|sOePrkOSaa	i think it would relly help if u didnt hide the fact that u like him, i mean if he flirts with u and i no how guys r since i am one, then obviously he's some wat intrested in a way so ya, ask him out. besides wats ther really to lose, if use r good friends and all then it wont matter whether he asks u out or u ask him out.|`|ItleV9qeaa	well it depends how much u like him and how much u like being friends with him  if u like him so much go for it but when u brake things won't be the same unless ur gonna make it last  or u can go up to him and talk to him about everything and just be friends|`|WhTrX9KNaa	ok that was a long question...sounds like high school drama... look if you like the guy go for it ask him out if u guys date and your friend gets mad then she is not much of a friend anyway any true friend should be happy for you as long as you are happy. so get a back bone and be blunt to people or life will walk all over you!!|`|GR5Fa7Shaa	So your in school?  So i'm assuming that your either in middle or high school.   might be wrong but my advice for you is too be straight with the whole thing.  If you think that he definitely likes you then i say go for it.  If your not sure on whether he likes you or not, it still can hurt to and get his attention.  (talk to him start a conversation)  I hope this helps but for the email,  I'm sorry that you didn't sign it but instead of talking over e-mail talk to him.  I'm sure he'll like your confidence   Good luck|`|YoQhSTOMaa	I think you should tell him straight out who you are and see what happens from there, if he likes you then you guys can become a couple if not then move on and find someone else.|`|SgTKWAanaa	well i deal with these problems all of the time. i always deal wit relationship problems and will be gladly to answer yours......    well first........  it was a very good thing that you told him that you liked him....but not signing it was sorta bad...if he does ask who it is then just tell him...and if he doesn't i think that you should tell him in a note or in person in school....and yes it does matter if you are happy it always does.....and if your friend does like him ask if it is alright if you can date him if she says no because she likes him then just go for it.....be wit him because if she really if your true friend then she would want you to be happy with anyone       p.s     anyone please ask meh any problems in your life i love to help solve them...and tell meh how my advice works out hope it help ya|`|7InYcUSUaa	ask him out..the worst he can do is say no & it will be done with    and if he asks who is this on the e-mail tell him the truth
qZQq68BCaa	Oh hell yeah!!!  K, so my friend Josh we were all hangin out at the mall and i had a some gym shorts on and he pants'd me so i like pulled them up really fast and told him he would regret it..well i called 4 of my other guy friends (macho dudes XD) and i took him into Windsor (frilly dress place) and i got the other guy's to take him into the dressing room and put a short frilly pink dress on him and i took pictures and made lil posters and put them all around the mall XD........        Yes I know. Brilliant???/ I"m amazing!!    lol    Danea|`|EzpEyVnraa	A girlfriend left me and two weeks later, she's hitting on one of my mates. I didn't approve, and she left me via text, which was a bit cowardly. So I simply slept with her best friend. Best part was, her best friend was a virgin. I'm proud of the revenge, but not so much taking her best friend's virginity. I'm pretty sure everyone's opinion of me, who reads this, is going to plummet.
QRSRJ7U1aa	Sorry you have to deal with someone so negative in your family.  Talk to your dad ahead of time and ask him for help to deal with this woman.  Tell him you are afraid that she will try to undermine the relationship you have with him and your mom.  Explain that your worried  because she cant seem to help jumping to the worse conclusions possible.  Ask your Dad how to keep this from happening.|`|HjMbOgvqaa	Confront this woman with your mom and dad prove that she is a lying trouble maker and also tell your dad that you will introduce him to all your friends if that is what he wants,The way to stop her is to confront her.
WccDpEWWaa	You can help her by just communicating. Tell her how you feel, and tell her that her life isn't that bad, because it could be worse. At least she has medical care, and a family that loves her. I know that you want to do everything you can to help her. Even though there is not much for you to do, she'll feel a lot better if you just support her. Good luck, I hope your family will feel better ! =]
eOkohAMXaa	learn to not care what ppl think of you.  figure out the weird, quirky things about yourself and let them show more.  i'm DifFerent, w/ a capital D and F but only one F.  and its cuz i decided that i'm just gonna be me.  i dress vintage and crazy  i love what i love and don't hide it (like llamas :))  i'm not scared to go crazy and laugh a lot.  just find yourself and let yourself show to be best.    maybe you are a more 'normal' person  but normal doesn't rly exist, you know?  its just people's perspectives of you.|`|PP211c02aa	u cant...its a natural thing..some people posses high charisma and are like that...u obviously dont..and if u try to be people will be able to tell ur a fake and not being urself ...but if u want to pretend be a lil more spontaneous|`|W3McYGPIaa	my older sister had this problem  last year, what she did was tried  listening to more up beat music   and danced like nobody was watching.  you sound like you care what people think about you  just ignore there thoughts and let loose   as long you are comfortable with yourself   your on the right road.   good luck!   remember let loose! and dance like   nobody is  watching!|`|BAwDMoJPaa	fight the power be a rebel|`|NEQcHaF8aa	be more random, don't get in the flow, be original, keep em' guessin all of those things|`|j1xB9LmDaa	find what they like and show interest in the things they love. talk about current things like sports, a new coo/bad song etc. and don't try to be cool it just comes naturally.|`|SzsrajV4aa	You're over-thinking this a bit too much. You shouldn't be worrying about what other people think about you. It may sound cliche, but just be yourself. Never change yourself for other people.    And seeing that you have friends in the first place shows that you must have some good points about you!    Best advice I can give you; your attitude is contagious and effects the people around you. So just be happy!|`|TgzYyEfJaa	just relax|`|sfl63QxAaa	Drink heavily|`|w5bZ8Hhqaa	Just have fun and party and do stuff that is unusual that you would do.|`|cd5eb0e9ec80482bed5491827a61e262aa	I wish I knew because I would be more fun myself.|`|JwDWwgIcaa	hahahahahahaha be like me :D i am like so random.....and fun i think....    any way just like let loose    say random things like    "I dropped my i-Pod in the toilet" (i really did) or something like that    be like friends, random!    hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahha    :D     everyone is strange in their own special way :D|`|X0vhUEtoaa	Just shout out random stuff in the hallway. Me and my friends are random (no one I know is normal) and fun, too. Find out what's "cool" and do the opposite. And you need to TRY to go with the flow of your friends. And don't think that being normal is bad... it's just normal!!! Oh, and shop @ Hot Topic... Aeropostal is for preps, but Hot Topic is for the weirdos. Like me! :)|`|8xXPnKsQaa	-No all your flaws and embrace them as a part of who you are.  - If you don't want to be considered normal then don't put yourself in that category.   -You are who you are, and that is what you will always be,So get comfortable with yourself.   -Your friends of all people should be able to understand you, and If they are your friends then they problie like you the way you are.     :)|`|UBuYAe1Faa	Don't force yourself to fit in. Be who you are!|`|9bwF2kUbaa	eat candy to get hyper|`|ey6n5Od0aa	u sound like my bestfriend  just get hyper   be loud  copy the others  have fun   have bum fun ( not literally but u no )  good luck|`|QqGhOaIJaa	well maybe you should pretend that your a whole different person and act completely different. Say yes to everything like in the movie the yes man|`|1NvTeGp4aa	I thought about many things to say to you regarding your question, but only one real answer stood out: be yourself and don't worry about being "normal". The effort in being normal, as well as the effort to become "not-normal" or "different" may turn you into something people will find uncomfortable to be with and talk to.    I bet being yourself will turn out to be far more different than you expected.|`|j0zDQQG2aa	I get too many claims about people being worried about being abnormal, now your telling me that you can be too normal.    Normal doesn't exist.    I don't get it!|`|T18Euapnaa	I know how you feel, i feel that way all the time what i tell my self is to be myself and be nice to others. And if that does not work just be your self and find new friend if you want. Or ask them if you are bothering them.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	There's nothing wrong with being normal my friend. If you have to be someone you're not, then those aren't the friends you need to have. You can try and be more talkative, make funny jokes, etc,, but don't do anything that may compromise your values. Being unique is an asset even though you may not think it now. Relax, be yourself and you'll be fine. Good luck!|`|5V1f3kldaa	relax..everyone is different and beautiful in their own way.  you friends may be totally chill, but that doesn't mean that you have to be.  Embrace your differences, because that is what makes you who you are.  Never ever try and change who you are to fit someone else's expectations of you.  The only person you should be listening to is yourself.    If it's hard for you to understand that try to imagine the world if everyone were exactly the same.  It would be extremely boring.  Be glad that each person is unique.       it sounds like you are not confidante with yourself.  When you are uncomfortable with yourself no one will take you seriously.  so remember...keep you head up, and a smile on your face, because you are you and no one can take that from you.

I don't know if you are exaggerating a bit or not.. but I don't think you're mean... the Russians, huh?|`|HRvPoQzKaa	Sounds like he has bipolar and schizophrenia.|`|aSSXt6tlaa	From a teens prospective, yes, he is a complete loon.  However, from an adult prospective, try to see it our way.  He is working all the time to try to support his family.  He gets little help from anybody around the house.   He needs a vacation.  Probably hasn't had a good nights sleep for years.  He gets over-taxed by the government, underpaid from his employer, disrespected by his neighbors, yelled at by the women in his life.  His 401K plan is worth about half of what it did a year ago.  His stocks have slid under a rock.  His job is under threat of being out-sourced to another country, or worse yet, a lay-off is looming or eminent.    Food prices have gone up.  Car fuel is back on the rise.  His peanut butter is tainted with salmonilla.  I don't blame him for being crazy....it's crazy out there.  :)~
uTdEdpAeaa	yes i think that band would go very nicely with your engagement ring however your ring does need to be rhodium plated badly and cleaned professionally...    now you center stone looks no larger then a half carat so i would say anywhere between 3/8 ct to a 1/2 ct center.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	The one you chose looks just about right. You will need to see how it looks with the e-ring though, to see if they match/fit.|`|f3SyOyMEaa	I don't know the carat amount. But I say definitely the second one. The www.kay.com  Best Wishes!
sIibbA8Baa	Im 15 and i had the same problem last year. I had a bf and i never saw him. i finally got enough courage to tell him it was over. what i did was i walked over to him and told him that he was a really great person but i dont get to see you enough. I told him maybe later on.|`|TRvAhhNKaa	Try a text, change your facebook status to "Single and lovin' it", or leave break up Aim away message. If you don't see him it's not a problem right?|`|QHASqNDtaa	Don't listen to your friends. Everyone deserves to be happy, so end it so you can both be happy.|`|5XhoB4Cyaa	I'd deal this based on his personality. IF you see him getting very emotional or upset then i'd take him to a quiet place like parks, beach and tell him the goodies abt him and then break the news . If you think he can take it like a man then take him to a dinner . R'mber its not gonna matter how you did this or why you did this in 5 yrs from now. You would be actually be happy and proud you could stand up for what you thought was right.|`|J3iBuHAHaa	You shouldn't stay in a relationship just because it makes eveyone else happy. A relationship is between two people putting in effort to make it work. If he's not willing to put in the effort, and make you happy, then he isn't worth your time. Think of it this way, all the time you're spending with someone that's making you unhappy...you could be looking for the man of your dreams who will fullfill your every need. You should just tell him why you want to break up, give him about a week to change, and if he doesn't then dump him. :)|`|vOmeoo7Oaa	just tell him its not working out|`|9PICw7L6aa	say its not working out and that you dont see each other....  just tell him whats up.|`|MfUMaKcDaa	you're gay....um ok. well, just be like, we should break up, and be friends i guess|`|009Fbd1caa	Ok, well you need to be considerate...don't do it where he is likely to get embarrassed. Go out somewhere round the neighborhood, or whatever. And just break it to him gently..you obviously want different things, and as you're older its a little more difficult to be with him.    Good luck x :)|`|M7r7gHNGaa	Do you have an exclusive relationship? If you don't there is nothing to keep you from seeing other boys. He'll hear about it and will take the hint.     Don't listen to your friends because they are not the ones in your situation. You need to do what you need to do for your happiness. Prepare yourself to seek out this boyfriend you rarely see and explain that you do not want to continue being his girlfriend because of the fact that you don't see him often enough.    He may not like what you say but you do need to meet boys who are more mature because girls mature faster emotionally and you don't want to have to change boyfriends every two months.    Learn from this experience and use what you learn before you agree to be someone else's girlfriend.|`|WrbkvvGvaa	well, first of all, what your friends say doesn't matter with that type of thing, they're just trying to make fun of him or you.  if you don't feel like he's the one for you, just tell him, don't worry about his feelings, if you can get over him, he can get over you, there's someone for everyone, and it sounds like you two weren't made for eachother.  you both will find that someone.  just don't be mean to him, you don't want him to hate you, just be stern, be strong and be sure of what you're doing, if you're not, he'll beg you to come back to him, if you seem unsure, he'll put up more of a fight, but if you seem certain that that is what you want, he'll respect it.  and definitely do it in person, don't do it with a text or anything. if you feel like you don't want to do it in person, at least do it over the phone, but definitely DON'T want to do it with a text.  just tell him how you feel and that you don't think that you were supposed to be together, so you don't want to be together.    I really hope I helped =]  best of luck =]|`|MHFuJGdGaa	Best way is a clean, brutal, heartcrushing break.    Tell him it will never work, because you no longer find him to have an attractive personality.      This way there wont be any strings left attached.|`|oq29JFRfaa	if you don't like him then just do it.  your problems with him will be solved and you won't have to deal with the awkwardness.  if you're not happy with him just get it over with.  he might be hurt...but hey he's gonna get hurt sooner or later.  just try to be as nice as possible if you do choose to break ip with him.|`|i7rYRvlTaa	well if you never see him then whats the problem??|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	If your going to do it just do it it wouldn't be nice if you leave him hanging. As for your friends tell them to date him.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	Just dump him. So what if his heart breaks. He is not the first person to have a broken heart. Just be gentle with the little man...|`|GjsrcsZkaa	It's not about what your friends think honestly, Its how you feel. You will break his heart staying in the relationship with him because its not real. Do what's right.. Tell him you thought you were ready for a relationship but your not and go on tell him his a good guy but but you would rather be friends.|`|BopBYwSdaa	if you ask this question here then your heart already make up to break up with him but you just feel guilty.    follow your heart... so break up is hard to do but I hate to say this "go for it"|`|EdidZdtlaa	just tell him things werent working out but you'd still like to me friends.|`|YTp1lhsqaa	Then just tell him upfront, "we  need to talk" tell him the problem, and if he acts up, maybe he is a little too immature for you.
2lDQktYjaa	He has to ignore her. If he even replies with something bad she will still have hope because at least he replied. If she somehow gets his new cell  , he should call the service provider company and ask them to block her number, so she can't contact him.  I also was crazy for a guy when I was like 13 and altough I didn't send text messages and stuff, I still had hope every time he talked to me even if he was really not interested. Looking back I don't understand how I could have loved so much someone I didn't even know. This couldn't happen today, but when you're so young and it's your first feelings of love, it's really easy to act foolishly. The girl doesn't realize what she's doing, she just thinks that she's in love.|`|LCIcUTwNaa	He needs to set the record straight and just flat out tell her.|`|dHP0eJVBaa	wow that's REALLY clingy.  he should just tell her to stop contacting her and then ignore her if she contacts him again.|`|RvOH0hjhaa	how about you be a good sister, go to her house, and beat her ***. case closed|`|2KPq7Ewnaa	he can talk to her, ask her what she really wants.... or that they can jst be online friends.....|`|RyApVLzQaa	That's adorable. :)  He should learn to like her considering she's very clingy and he's the pushover type of guy he's more than likely to give in and say "Ok we can be best friends again."  Even if he doesn't mean it or does.  Maybe she will also learn to back off a bit and give him a little space to breath over time.|`|sQq8q4Biaa	I know exactly what your bro is going through and im the same way, i want everyone to be happy even if im not... well he could just be straight forward and tell her to f*ck off or he could ignore her. or you could go et a gun get some bullets and you can probably guess what i'll say next (don't really do it) but the thought will make you and your bro laugh|`|XDlQQ6eiaa	I think the best thing to do is completely ignore her.  Do not acknowledge her text messages, phone calls, or emails.    Things you ignore tend to go away quite quickly.|`|hZL7hCloaa	eliminate her|`|DXQgaShPaa	accept her apology, what is so bad about a couple of text messages?|`|eTH0vfZEaa	Just tell him how he feels about her, if he feels like he's getting annoyed by her which he is, then just tell her to stop texting me or something. By the time he says this, the person will stop liking him already, but your brother could say that they can still be friends. But I don't think that not meeting each other is called friendship but at the same time they text with each other so I guess it's okay to be friends? If he is getting annoyed by e-mails and text msgs tell her to stop texting him that often. Because I've gone through it before But I told her the truth and she understood, but we're still friends.|`|t7XnGkSOaa	he should just ignore her e-mails.  it will be the least painful way of letting her down. after all, if he goes along with this "best friends" thing it's only going to make the fall harder on her when she gets let down... which will happen eventually.  if he just ignores her she will forget about it... hopefully.  and he wont have to deal with her!   it all works out! good luck to your bro|`|xZI6noJiaa	For this sitch there is no way to make it painless.... For her at least. She sounds like a stalker-in-training.  I recommend NO CONTACT WHATSOEVER. As in- erase the F-ing e-mails. Do not even read them. And worse case scenario- have his buddy with the biggest brass set rip her up one side and down the other.    Ignore Ignore Ignore. Change screen names, take off of myspace/facebook, etc.|`|WqiJ1j4Naa	I think that what he should do is justplayin tell her the truth because since they dont even see each other that often he wont have to put up with her anymore. not even in texts or emails.

tManvxfQaa	It hurts we just don't allow others to see it    WE cry inside ..cause we are taught we Must be a Man and show no hurt or emotions....  we are to be Macho and manly    to cry and hurt is weakness...so we are taught by society...    No one but God see;s our tears on our pillows and we cant go to our friends and share our hurts and pains like the woman do......  Its like its a crime or something  and when we do share it with a woman they usually use it against us....and hurt us even more...and yet again we cant show it...cause we wouldn't be a man...    That's just how it is.....i wish woman would understand or at least try to...|`|Z0VvcKCraa	OMG THANK YOU!! That's exactly how I feel!!! I can't wait to hear the guys answer this question.|`|fGE7hL12aa	We have the same emotions that you have, we just don't express them. I don't know if it is genetic or a learned response, but we internalize our feelings.     If it makes you feel any better, you hurt us as much as we hurt you. We just deal with it by ourselves.|`|VSVQHKwKaa	Truth speaker has a great answer.    Men start off as little boys...and little boys are just as emotionally vulnerable as little girls. As we grow up, we're encouraged (rightfully) to harden our emotions and grow thicker skin.    This is a good idea if you ever have to work a job you hate for your family or are forced to kill an intruder. Part of Men's sacrifice is putting their own emotions on hold...so they can deal with the wife and children's emotional state.    But it's no mistake that many more men commit suicide than women.    The other reason is we're hardwired differently. There are 52 chemical equivalents that stimulate emotion. Men can MAKE all 52...but we only have about 4-6 available at any one time.    So before we can get emotional....we have to let some time pass. That is why a lot of men isolate themselves when they're unhappy. We know the emotional storm is coming....we get it out of sight.    It's not a bad thing when your husband goes to the woodshed for a few minutes to ponder over things. He wants no witnesses or distractions.     Women, on the other hand, have ALL 52....all the time. So they can switch easily from anger...to sympathy...to outrage...to kindness.     We've all seen it happen. Ever see a woman pick up a phone in the middle of a huge spat and talk like everything is just fine? It's like magic!    Ever seen a guy do the same? He usually screams into the receiver. He doesn't have nice on the brain.     In the end, men are wonderful engines that are emotionally equipped to suffer and forget. It makes them cold and impersonal at times...but it also minimizes stress, defeats fatigue, lessens heart break, and helps men to become quick friends after an emotional argument.    Can you imagine a world where men were just as emotional as women? Can you imagine how messy everything would be if your husband came home in a fit of tears and screamed "I don't think you love me!!!"    What a nightmare!|`|t26ctJdraa	ecuz thatvwomen is not for u!!!  if she cared she would b there for u!!!|`|jSPj3S6faa	We are not much evolved at all beyond our caveman days.    That really is the answer in a nutshell.|`|S5x6KNHraa	oh it bothers some men|`|kLtlTyr2aa	Not every guy is a solid shield of armor. I'm going to let you in on a little secret. Any guy who has been in love or really liked a person values anything that person would say to him. If you have a fight and say something out of anger or tell him something that you feel may hurt him, he WILL be hurt by it. It is easier for us to hide those feelings but they truly do leave a lasting impression. I don't feel that women are more emotional because I know a few women who appear to have that same shield of armor protecting their hearts as most men do. Each person will respond to hurt in their own way but no matter who you are hurt will always feel the same even if you don't show it. Testosterone makes it possible for men to channel that hurt into anger.

wnb0EgaHaa	I would encourage you to work very diligently to develop your own friends and support network if you have not.    I speak from experience as my marriage of over 12 years ended due to my husband's drug addiction.    You may love each other deeply, but it is imperative that you understand that the root of addiction is almost always "inner demons and issues."  It is not unusual for it to take years for an addict to work his or her way through recovery, and it is usually an ongoing effort.    While he is going through that process, he will, out of necessity, focus a great deal of time on self-analysis and developing techniques to identify and manage temptations and stresses. Those things require a tremendous amount of energy and strength.  He will not have a great deal left to share in support of others, and unfortunately, despite his love for you, that will apply to you as well.    His intentions may be good, but his ability to manage the things in his life to be able to include and be supportive of you will probably be minimal for some time yet to come.    Local support group, local women's center, or church - all could be possible sources of support or reference for you.      I would, as one of the other answerers recommended give him time and space, and concentrate on making your own life what you want it to be for you and your baby.  This way, you give yourself and your baby a better, stronger foundation, and at the same time, you lessen the pressure he may be feeling about you and his child.  That might sound terribly unfair, but it is realistic.    By doing so, you are enabling both of you to develop as stronger individuals, so that hopefully, there will come a point when you are both able to function capably and effectively in a mutually beneficial relationship.  That's what you deserve and what your child deserves and needs.      Just try not to rush things or get impatient.  Having more people that you can call on if you need a hand or just to talk can help when things get stressful for you.    Best of luck to you all.|`|xNkmK0SHaa	You must understand that he is not  a "recovered" addict and never will be.  He is a recovering addict if he is not practicing/using.    You will never know the things that were factors in his addiction;  he probably won't either.    You made the choice to have a sexual relationship with an addict.  It was unwise, clearly, but it was done.  You have a duty to yourself and your child to learn how best to deal with the life you have designed.    I am curious as to why you seem uninterested in Al-Anon.  The only other thing that I know that might help you is counseling/therapy.    The bottom line is that you are going to have to grow up in a big hurry - and by yourself. He is not going to be much support for you for a very  long itme, if ever.  He has all he can handle just trying to take care of himself.|`|fMEypXDYaa	Right now he is sort of totally focused on getting his life together so it isn't unusual that he tends to be more into what he is trying to do, you might want to think about letting him get his life together before you do much more with him before you commit to the guy on a full time relationship.|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	You'll never know what he's going through.  That seems to be a wall he built up and an excuse for bad behavior.    I think it's important that you find a way into that part of his life, around the wall.  Go to AA WITH him, go to the AA for friends and family.  Grab a few books about addiction.    Let him know how this is making you feel.|`|fc2633d8f192d5530fac717c9c7ca3e9aa	Be careful...during his "down time" where he shuts you out, he may be using. I hope he has been clean and sober but it may not be an easy road with an addict, especially if they go in a cyle of using and sobriety. Get yourself to those alanon (or similar) support groups so you can understand what is happening and help him to get along in a clean life.
jbxGEdVbaa	You didn't do anything wrong Mayor McCheese. You're friend was being a total dick bag and deserved every bone breaking fist that you were giving him. I say you go back into the hospital and lay your gentalia on his face to really teach him a real lesson. Make sure the family is there to see that one to show them that you mean business. If they continue to give you crap, mount his girlfriend and give her some soul stealing anal. I guarantee it will be the last time that anyone gives you a hard time.    -You've just been sacked by The Hamburglar.|`|xFm5wzuXaa	When someone thinks you are being a whining bore.|`|1DjDf8yqaa	when someone does that they are sarcastically showing a false state of sympathy.

VSVQHKwKaa	Honey,    If he's very good and really sweet to you...why are stressing over the little stuff?    If he is working hard for you,protects you, loves you, treats you well....and keeps some nudie pics on the phone....    Well, I know a lot of wives who'd swap husbands with you in a heartbeat.    Sometimes, you just have to not be determined to be angry about something.     Just shrug and let it go. As long as you're still his woman, his lover, his wife, and his friend...everything else is gravy.    Good Luck!|`|dkUvwXXWaa	That really sucks, that you are feeling that way about it. I mean from the sound of it you seem to feel like he loves you and appreciates you. But yet your letting the negative slowly eat away at that. After 12 + yrs of looking at porn its going to be something hard for him to break. If he even is willing to. All I can say is just keep talking to him about it. The things we say really do sink in. Make little comments, not rude or mean but to the point. I hope everything works out. Good luck|`|N9o2ZEtXaa	You first need to be beautiful in your own eyes . And beauty shines from within !! If you believe you are beautiful so will your husband . As long as he is not trying to get with these women or not having sex with you because he has masturbated to these women , then dont give it much thought .|`|PseVmBS8aa	There is nothing wrong with you. He sound like he is a visual type of guy, but you better watch out because if he keeps looking it is only a matter of time before he is thinking of someone else while making love to you then it leads to trying it out.|`|AdA7iQs2aa	that is very disrespectful of him. When you get married you loose most of your freedom and if your partner doesnt want you talking to other females in your case then he should respect that. Talk to him in a serious note and let him know how uncomfy you feel, i really dont know the solution maybe counseling???  Goodluck|`|ke7wLRdJaa	men need to have their fantasies, it would be a totally different issue if he were doing anything else with those women pictured in his cellphone. try to ignore it. it shouldnt be anything serious.|`|AA11656721	When a man looks at these things it is like he has committed Adultery in his heart.  If he continues to do this he has no respect for you and your feelings.  Give him an ultimatum.  Stop or leave until he can see that what he is doing is wrong.  Many people out there support Pornographic Material, but I think it is Unclean, immoral, and ruins a marriage.  It certainly does not teach young men good things about women.  Or how to respect a women.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	You keep "telling" him you don't like it.  But have you sat down and explained that it hurts you, makes you feel you're not good enough?  That it make you wonder if you are beautiful in his eyes?    The harder you try to get rid of it, the tighter he will hang on to it.  He's good to you, and, in your words, very sweet to you.  His liking porn actually has nothing to do with you.  You are making it out to be something bigger than it is.|`|DbNbWQflaa	yeah start watching it too. since you knew it from the start he figured you excepted it then so he is used to it  old habits are hard to kick sometimes,its just fantasy for men ,he could be going to strip clubs without you. so look at it from that point of view,
5Q8vMxuqaa	Nah girl he probably wasn't making fun of you, he probably wanted to say something till his friend interrupted. So yea just wait till he talks to you to find out, or if you really like him back then you try making the first move :) Don't worry when guys make fun of girls they laugh at em and stuff like that, usually they make jokes about em and laughs with their friends. If he likes you wouldn't try and give you the impression that hes making fun of you..so yea hope that helped :) good luck.|`|OOptQPnFaa	try communicating with him if u can|`|WjVZ7n4Iaa	he is just interested in you, maybe more. Don't always jump to the defensive and think they are out to get you. heh|`|3DDgXmXVaa	yeah it sounds like he does. just try talking! laugh if he says something funny. he's prob nervous too|`|XDlQQ6eiaa	He luuuurrrrvvvvve's you.|`|XSoAZD82aa	im pretty sure he likes u because he is paying attention to the things that u like and he wants u two to have somthing in common so u will go out with him. let me tell u a story on how me and my girlfriend started dating. (im a senior in HS) i over heard that she loves shaq and for basketball i requested   32 since that is shaq's number and she came over started to tell me how much she loves shaq and to her she thought we had a lot in common so she took me to the girls locker room and we had sex the whole game. it was AMAZING. do the same with this guy and mak sure that when he cums u keep sucking because it feels amazing!!!         good luck|`|8K1EtcyJaa	dont play games with them jerks life is to short
3BrOSZujaa	woow. major friend problems. She obviously is still friends with you and dosn't admitt she had done something wrong. You should try confronting her ask her nicely "why did you say that?" make sure you get an answer and if she's doing it to be mean find new friends i no that's hard to do because they all are usually token but you would rather have 1 or 2 good friends than 100 fake friends right.    Hope you do the right thing that suits you. please ask her even if you don't like my answer. I want the best thing for you. You are just like me. Check out my network questions on bullying, they are major confusing. Also may I add you to my contacts?     -Melody T|`|M5XjqI40aa	She doesn't sound like a true friend.

Just take it and grin and bear it and be grateful you have a friend.  Cherish the times you are having together, it will make you a better person to overcome in times of diversity and be a good roll model for others.  She is a punk but you are wise, beauty radiates from inside.|`|FU68yfGCaa	Hunny, if she does that to you, then she isnt really your friend.  But if you have your heart set on staying friends with her, then you need to confront her with it.  Talk to her about it and tell her how it makes you feel.  If she is a true friend to you, then she will understand.  I have had this problem before.  I talked to my friend who was doing it to me about it and she understood.  We are as good as new now!   hope i helped! :)|`|IYLlupdkaa	she is being passive-aggressive. one of the worst personalities to be around-  I would tell her I dont appreciate it & that it is rude even if she tries to act like she was kidding-  if she doesnt stop I would not consider her a friend & stop hanging around w/ her-|`|AwEspXiiaa	Cause she is mad at her miserable stupid life..

Hang with people that treat you right.|`|1QLp7iC5aa	She is probably jealous of you for some reason, you dont need friends like that, life is too short.|`|KRDwCai5aa	what a terrible friend.  i don't know what her intentions are, but talk to her about it.  if she doesn't change, ditch her.  she's being a jerk.|`|t8goUrnzaa	If she's saying stuff like that, then she probably isn't a good friend and you should just ditch her.|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	She sounds like a jerk.  When someone says stuff like that to you, you need to find new friends.  I don't care how good of a friend they were to you,  they sure aren't a good one now!  She probably has a lot of insecurities, and shooting you down helps her ego.  It probably makes her feel better about herself.  My advice is this: Find someone who DOESN'T want to hurt you.  Good luck. :)|`|37PYnKr9aa	Tell her to cut it out and if she doesnt stop, you wont be her friend anymore. A friend should be uplifting and have your back no matter what. If she keeps it up, smack her in the mouth and tell her to grow up. That might get you in trouble, so I would advise the first thing I told you.|`|DU9dx1Uzaa	Well, she might just be imature.  She might have low self esteem and she feels better when she puts you down, or she might just not be the friend you think she is...Regardless of the reason...She has NO right to talk to you that way.    Just talk to her in private and let her know just how much it hurts you when she says mean things to you, or when she hurts your feelings.  If she apologizes great...If not then you are better off not being friends with her.  If she apologizes, but keeps doing it, then you get your self some new friends!    Good luck.|`|EQydFhzmaa	She isn't a friend. Dump her, or if you really want to save the friendship (I don't think she is worth it), I would confront her - be serious about it. If her answer is cocky and self-centered, than you need to let her go. Again, I would get rid of her, but it's up to you. Best of luck.|`|FbJ5samUaa	Not much of a real friend.  A true friend would do everything to spare your feelings, and build you up.  If this helps, most people that put others down, do it because they feel inadequate about themselves and when they say hurtful things to others, it makes them feel superior.  Friends typically have a greater influence on who you turn out to be than your family does, so be careful of the friends you choose.  If they don't have good character, then find a new flock, to fly with...  or you could be sorry down the road.|`|JXAgD52Aaa	girls are really catty and jealous try to talk to her maybe she is insecure and wants to make her self feel better|`|8wJFofO0aa	if she enjoys say stuff like that call her a ***** or  if ur yonger tell her u dont care about anything just tell her to stay out of ur life it happened to me with this girl named arlene i told her the same thing   an if she bothers u stilll tell the teach|`|XjcER6zvaa	first of all you are not ugly secondly sit down talk to her girls have a tendency  to be point blank and sometimes we don't know it hurts. invite her to a sleepover and just talk no one Else just you and her. explain the situation and hopefully everthing will work out|`|j6x87Ledaa	honey im sorry to tell you that your "best friend" is not your best friend at ALL.  she is a very self conscious person whose self steem is in the gutter becasue she knows you are a little more vulnerable, she picks on you to make herself feel more superior and better. u are her safety blanket you are the one thing she looks at and knows she can manioulate with words. until the day u tell her that u are sick and tired of her ugly remearks and that in order for you too to continue being friends, she needs to learn how to respect you the same way u respect her.    she doesnt deserve a friend like you and she knows it but she will always do this to you because she knows you let her. put your foot down and watch  her break down .... then you will be friends and she will see you as an equal not as her escape goat.  good luck honey love your self and show her you do so that she realizes she cant hurt you unless you allow her to|`|TjePtr7Aaa	Tell her straight out- she thinks she is bieng funny its important that you tell her you don't like what she is doing- and from now on keep your secret from her until you know she can be trusted...

4o3jXz3Waa	You can't change someone else's perspective of a situation.  He's the husband and sees himself as the provider and feels responsible, regardless of the circumstances, of your financial and living situation.    All you can do is be supportive, make sure he knows that you don't blame him, stay positive, especially around him, and remind him that this is only temporary.  It will only get better from here.    His reaction is a natural one........I know because I am going through the same thing with my husband who lost his job in October.  He hasn't found another one yet.  Just remind him that you both still have what's most important......each other.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	Actually if you just go out of your way to continue to act loving (and as hard as it might be romantic when possible) toward him he will believe that.

s6O9PU1iaa	Hi,     This answer is far from detailed but it may help. Not Baltimore area. Howard County MD is a lil distant but Rockville is actually a nice area. ( I believe its in Montgomery County MD)  Definitely quality high schools and private schools in the area. Most high schools in the area are big with a minimum of 2000+ students. Of course the Washington Post is the main newspaper. There are several news magazines out of the DC area. By the way I live in Baltimore, grew up in southern MD. Oh Northern VA (if I m not mistaken) is fairly close to the Rockville area, so job opportunities are vast with Rockville/D.C./Northern Va all being in less than an hours proximity to each other.    Ok just a nosy yahoo-er chipping in!. Best wishes and congratulations

lMT8btn8aa	IF this claymation is specific to her, then don't do it.    Invest your time, money, and energy getting to know other women.    Also, Valentine's day is overrated.|`|xgui1LAFaa	make the claymation, and give it to her... she wat she thinks:S|`|2imXzBHbaa	I love claymation. Post it on youtube and post link here.|`|0V2UrTqoaa	yeah me too! I hate valentines day because I'm always alone!|`|AvA2972uaa	make it anyway man girls love stuff made for them. if not go all out for her take her to dinner and sweep her off her feet|`|tNSGSxezaa	who cares about valinedouche day slow down and you'll find a better person|`|GETehbzhaa	Claymations' are sweet! make it anyways maybe it will help you figure yourself out.|`|QhXL4Lilaa	No way, just because its VDAY doesn't mean you must have a girl or your world will be   crushed... If you find a girl now, she will only be after your gifts, and not you...|`|S852p6SXaa	give it to someone else. a friend, family member, someone.|`|OrOxSI1Haa	yeah tough luck dude i'm in the same sittuation sort of i guess you could say i wish you luck though|`|EVtLlSEwaa	Don't chase after a girl just because you know you can get her. That is wrong for many reasons. Finish the claymation if you spent a lot of time on it and dont want to waste it, but don't think you must have a gf for Vday. It is okay to not have someone. That happens in life. Be a strong person and be okay with being single.|`|mvaPdekPaa	haha idk... wats a claymation? well dont bother im no help anyway, lol. good luck, sry dont have much more than that.|`|nvUdanmEaa	Forget about her, give it to MMMMEEEEEE........I'll love you forever for it. truly.|`|HnrDCipfaa	what the F>>UCK is a claymation!!!!!!!!!!
TsoXZKSyaa	Alot of guys are always afraid of being "weak", however, it takes a strong man to allow himself to become vulnerable in a relationship.  You can only be in a true relationship when you allow youself to be set up for some hurt (but trust them not to hurt you).  That being said, you apologized AFTER you broke up and I realize this.  Even so, I think you did the right thing in apologizing because she apologized to you, and now you did to her and you can become better friends again (and maybe more later if it ends up that way :)).  My advice is, the best thing to do in a relationship is be honest, if you're sorry about something, don't hide that to try to be "tough", because it only ends up hurting both people.  Think of this: if you had never apologized, what would have happened? Probably nothing, you two probably wouldn't have felt that you could be closer again.  She definately wouldn't have felt that things could be better because she would still be upset that you got mad at her :P and would think that you still were mad at her, and she would still feel bad :( (but she probably still does feel bad for what she did....but now she can work through it because you are friends again and things can be better).    It isn't "weak" at all :) You did a very good thing, it takes a big man to apologize, and if more men did that (and meant it), then relationships would be a whole lot easier :)    Don't worry, you did the right thing ;)  hope things work out well for you now!!! :)|`|7To6sEYyaa	No, thats not bad. Now you two are friends. The only problem would be if you let her walk over you again. If you act like a push over, she'll expect you to understand if she does anything wrong. So don't be a push over. But you should always apologize if you've done something wrong. Good for you!|`|WB028eTDaa	It's never a bad thing to apologize.|`|aQ8utQOeaa	No, if you felt sorry then all you did was follow your heart and make peace with a choice you had made.|`|PBDXgNBgaa	yea that was kinda stupid..imean you did what you felt was right at the time but yea i would have never done that. never appologize..unles you did something crazy|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	There is nothing "weak" about apologizing for acting like an ***. If you don't want her to walk over you, then stand your ground and don't let her walk over you.|`|ngLwXT23aa	stand up to her! don't be a push over and take your other friends advice|`|StJGeiFyaa	it's a little late to change your mind. what's the big deal with making amends with someone? get over yourself. i'm sure she's not losing sleep over if you "should have" apologized or not. just move on.|`|yTD84yFlaa	I don't see how "being nice" = "not having a backbone"    Does your friend have a track record of immature moves?    You made the right choice.|`|6ptEbqCgaa	It shows you're are a real man because you can admit your mistakes, and apologize to a girl you hurt. good job :)|`|8a2a91d64a774b8e3294c2cc6998db32aa	apologizing never makes anyone look weak, it just humanizes you and anyone who says it makes you weak is just an insecure person. It was the right thing to do because now you're on good terms right!|`|bbzs543yaa	no it wasn't bad beacuse no matter what you both did some rude things. Apologizing brought you a step closer to a good friendship. Just make sure you set your rules down and don't be ran over. thats never the way to fix a problem:) hope this helps|`|bmrxGgw8aa	if it makes you feel like a better person, no. just dont let her manipulate you. if you dont want to get hurt, dont let her hurt you. you can still be her friend. but watch your back. and dont overreact.|`|CUl0TTuoaa	na not at all apologizing shows maturity and respect you did the right thing but as for her "walking all over you" dont jump right back into the relationship find out her reason for lien after clearing things up more thouroughly you will be able to make a better decition on things|`|AX3DQw3Paa	No, it showed that you have manners. However, don't let her walk over you again. Draw the line. You're a man, act like it. Be polite, but firm.|`|ShaUAySvaa	yes and no,  both have there pros and cons,   don't stress it,  you will be happier just moving on,  you can't undo the past,  just be happy :]    my fav quote "As we grow up we learn that..even the one person that wasn't supposed to ever let you down will. You will have your heart broken more than once and it's harder every time. You'll break hearts too, so remember how it felt when yours was broken. You'll fight with your best friend.You'll blame a new love for things an old one did. You'll cry because time is passing too fast, and you'll eventually lose someone you love. So take too many pictures, laugh too much, and love like you've never been hurt."  ~Unknown|`|jj9G0BBraa	No. But letting her walk on you is a bad idea.You were a man when you apologized, now be a man again and stop being a doormat.|`|l3eT6IZzaa	it didn't make you look weak... it made you look like a gentleman... when you apologize, you pretty much made her realize that she lost someone that cares about her...|`|174pexgPaa	No it was a great idea to apologize, because now hopefully things won't be awkward because it's all worked out.  Your friend is wrong about her being able to walk all over you though because your not even dating her anymore.  It makes you look like a strong individual because you forgave someone who really hurt you and that takes a lot of guts in my opinion.  Good work and you did the right thing.|`|ELbs3Dpwaa	No, it wasn't wrong.  You were mean and apologizing was the right thing for you to do.  Yes, it would be nice if she apologized for her own behavior, but that is not the point.  You did what was right and it doesn't make you look weak at all.  Hopefully, no matter what she does in the future you will not allow her to control your emotions and avoid being in a situation that allows her to walk over you.|`|tn1CqxMcaa	im sure she doesnt look at that way shes  probley felt pretty shitty herself so i belive you did the right thing.|`|KblMZiHpaa	Weak and desperation go hand in hand. You would have looked weak AND desperate if you were chasing her for months even after she broke up with you by lying.    What you did was the decent thing to do, and mad props because most people have forgotten common courtesy.Think about it, girls talk. She's likely to mention to a close friend that you apologized to her and it really just makes you look better   : )    I hope this helps :)
6NZamyGPaa	everyone wants what they don't have.|`|2gfJUgc3aa	she's toying with your emotions. move on for good.|`|6DloIDomaa	do what you feel like...i mean....u need to ask yourself if you like her....if u do...then do her the next time u break up with her and she wants u....lol|`|EQydFhzmaa	No, it doesn't. She obviously wants what she can't have. I would just forget her and the relationship. Get some closure and move on.|`|N2O9LUwaaa	I'd say you should drop it, 'cause it sounds like she's playin' with ya. She shows interest so that you will come back, but when your there she doesn't care. She just can't accept that you might be interested in other girls. Let her go, dude. You can do better than this.|`|GwEZ8uJnaa	well if i were you i would ask myself, how can it have potential if it can never get started.   In order for a relationship to have potential it needs to at least start off strongly. And even if it doesn't it usually builds up to a strong base fairly quick if you guys are having fun being together and what not. After three years of an on and off, and her only being interested in you when you are not, that would just make me feel like i was getting little games played on me. that's ridiculous. either she wants you or she doesn't, it is as simple as that. i am really rather surprised you were able to be a trooper and put up with that for so long.   keep talking to the other girls, i think you gave her a fair amount of good chances and she blew them.|`|WkQRC8Bzaa	Three years? Three years is long enough to wait to see if there's potential. No. You don't want to wait around for this slow poke. Keep your eyes on the horizon.|`|I0g24Jmkaa	leave her be and find someone who you aren't on and off with.|`|v0V5BKnsaa	dude. forget it. my last chick was the same way.  she treated me like a peice of meat an fd me over so many times.  unless u like bn hurt|`|Uy8ntukjaa	This relationship does not sound healthy or like it is going anywhere. Your gf has forbidden fruit syndrome, she just doesn't want anyone else to have you. You need to cut things off and find someone you can develop a respectful and intimate relationship with. She obviously isn't happy with herself so she won't ever be happy with you.|`|9Z48RhlKaa	I think that this is just a waste of your time. If you cant hold a relationship for 3 years. It is not worth it. You should have a gf that shows interest in you all the time.  Not just the times when you are not with her, or with other girls.  That isnt fair for you.  I would say break it off completely and find a gril that will actually like you.    My personal opinion is that off and on relationships are a waste of time.|`|YoQhSTOMaa	talk to her and be honest and see what she says....if she doesn't want to be in a relationship with you then move on and find someone who will appreciate you for you|`|FdK1POvmaa	Zero Potential. She will be content in a abusive relationship. You basically have to be a dick to her all the time for her to keep interest.|`|lbMUNNCuaa	She has major dad issues... I was the same way sometimes. She has a lot of growing up to do and believe me, you don't need her to figure that out through you. Maybe you can be her friend, but this young lady is obviously confused and doesn't get that turning to guys for love is not the answer. She needs to center herself and figure out what direction she wants with her life. You may feel drawn to her as a knight in shining armor for his damsel in distress...be her friend. Nothing more.|`|lCAXR4Xpaa	frankly, i would just move on. she seems to have the complex of wanting only something she cant have.. which happens. but itd be in ur best interest to just forget about it.|`|OfPSBAu5aa	She seems to be playing hard to get. You shouldn't be at her every beckon call, in my opinion, she's not worth your time or effort.|`|fwdJLU91aa	if you start dating then the 'chase' and the 'game of trying to get you' is over.. alot of girls do this..   they get bored if they can have you without a challenge...|`|HlRWA3JHaa	i will tell you pop and plain what the deal is with her.  1- she enjoys playing mind games  2- she can't be contented  3-she have issues of letting go     so it's left to you to either be patient with her or speak your mind to her.|`|BbEo2HOzaa	Stop wasting your time with this and move on.  If she has to wonder, she's yanking' your chain trying to keep you from enjoying the company of a girl who will truly care for you.

WOULD U LIKE THAT IF HIS GF DID THAT TO U?    please answer the first question under my profile, thank you SO much!   lots of love,   sarah|`|G6VIiWsvaa	Maybe he is just being friendly, jus back off away from him, hes got someone already, im sure there are other single guys out there for you.|`|Ccs9LeIEaa	oh my god.     give up on him. for every one taken "perfect" guy out there is at least 2 just as great single guys walking around. wanna know why you dont like those guys..? bc you like a challenge.     and seriously? you're in high school im assuming, by the halls comment and your sheer immaturity, but do you really want a bf who will leave you for the next hussy who bats her eyes at him?|`|KeRbiNKeaa	He has a girlfriend all ready so leave him alone! If he really wanted you then he would end it with her and be with you. Find a guy who is SINGLE! Girls who go after guys in a relationship just p*ss me off!|`|TRvAhhNKaa	You ARE that girl that breaks up couples. If he's still with his girlfriend, then he's not that into you. Are you sure it's not all in your head? There are a lot of guys in this world, find one that's single and wouldn't cheat on his girlfriend, which is what you're trying to get this poor guy to do.|`|gOJULd63aa	tell him to his face how you feel.ask him if he feels the same way|`|HMg97Fxjaa	Go for him. Who cares what other people think.|`|DJ9QosvDaa	to avoid the cliche "just tell him how you feel", I will attack it this way...if he really is possibly into, be patient...as bad as it sounds on so many levels he will eventually (probably sooner than you think) work his way around to you...in the meantime, keep dropping hints that you are least interested as well|`|BMpLu8efaa	Just smile knowingly and wait. When they are over you know you really have a chance at it. Ans he does like you but he's a little confused.|`|kiIqpZ18aa	well im just gonna say dont be the one to break them up  just wait till he does it himself and please dont wear clothes that will expose ur body so that he notices u more.  that just make him like u for the wrong reasons  just put urself in the other girls position.how would it  feel?  if he does break it up wit her. dont jump on his dick that second.  give him time dont rush his decisions.|`|tsBL19qzaa	"i don't want to be one of those girls who trys to break up relationships but i want him to break up with his girlfriend and ask me out"    Well, then quit trying butt your way into his life. How would feel if some girl did that to your bf, and he dumped you for her? You wouldn't feel very happy at all about it.|`|PxBmnuOoaa	well i understand completely how you feel because i was in that situation before and i found out that there is no real way to do it. but what worked for me is i talked to him and i told him how i felt for real. then i said to him, if you can say truthfully that you have no feelings for me, then i will leave right now and leave you and (said girlfriend) alone.    It worked for me because i knew i really liked him and i didn't see it working out between him and his girlfriend. and i really really liked him.   If you think this will work out, you should try it. Build up some confidence but don't be to disappointed if it doesn't go the way you want.   If you do it the right way, and don't be to pushy, he will remember you and maybe if you still like him when he and said girlfriend brake up (they will brake up because high school relationships don't last forever) maybe he will ask you out.     just remember, do it the right way, don't be too pushy and don't make him think you are a creepy stalker.     GOOD LUCK =]|`|MhzlGHkyaa	I think he's just being friendly...  Anyways, how would you feel if you were his girlfriend?  And if he did break up with her to date you, he could just  as easily break up with you to date someone else.. Right now  I would just be friends with him and if and when they do break up  is when you should make your move.    Good Luck! :-]|`|OVQXvu2baa	All you can do is let him know you like him - then wait... (but not hopelessly) -- keep your life.. but keep tabs on him..    If you try and break them up, he will not respect you.. he will respect a girl who will not try to come between couples... and in turn, if and when you nab him, he more than likely will not go after other girls.. (think Angelina Jolie/Bradd Pitt - she 'apparently' flirted like crazy, he got the message she was into him.. she even teased him a bit.. but refused to 'sleep' with him because he was married.. classic story.. he leaves wife to get her.. and there he stays ever faithful).. now, had she put out, where do you think she'd be.. just a notch on his belt..|`|XAPLAklXaa	i was in the same situation a few weeks ago... me and this guy really liked eachother but he had a gf. And unfortunately if you really want him, ur gonna have to become one of those girls who breaks up relationships or ur just gonna be by urself.I suggest turning up the flirting a little bit. Remember guys don't think with thier brains, they think with... well you know. lol     And i started flirting with the guy and within a few days he broke up with his gf and asked me out! :)|`|i8Cbh88jaa	whoa. i am in the same situation. good luck =] haha sorry i didn't answer the qustion. i hate it though im like just break up with her!! he found out today lol. well yeah...
JhrdIVBgaa	He is probably just joking, thats what it sounds like. Don't mean to hurt your feelings because when he didnt answer he was probably like, WOAH. But I can tell he really does like you as a friend. You just gotta work on it.|`|8QJJGZY3aa	He was probably embarrased.  He might not nof wanted you to know he liked you cuz he didn't know if you liked him.|`|btghmpQhaa	Ahh, thats so cute. He probably was just embarrased and didnt know what to say. I wouldnt take it to personally if i were you|`|rN0b4jWHaa	he might of been embarrassed that he told u or let u know he thinks your cute.|`|U4TeE4M6aa	somebody likes u! lol
XR3SPPCVaa	You can call him just to check up on him to make sure he's alright. (Don't call too often because that can get annoying) but calling shows that you care about him and that will mean a lot even if he doesn't say it does. You can bring him some hot soup to school or maybe even have one of your parents drive you to his house to surprise him! (It would look good to his parents too!) You can write him a letter explaining how you feel about him, a poem would probably cheer him up, and make sure you tell him I love you!!!! That should just about do it! :-)|`|9jWjyKeuaa	Just talking to him really does help.  A lot of girls don't believe it but when a guy likes a girl, just talking to that girl is enough to turn the worst day around.  So just talk to him when he needs some company and maybe try to go visit him if you can.
b4GYpz9Maa	You did nothing wrong.  I just don't want everyone in our class to know that you gave me the best HJ i have ever had.  Can we sit together tomorrow?  XOXOX|`|bM4zYt44aa	What you did wrong was not rub mine.  I would have taken you to the bedroom and handled that situation like a man.  Maybe he is insecure of that, maybe it's small or he just doesn't know what to do.  But feel free to rub mine any time.|`|xnmit1Udaa	In my opinion u didnt do nothin wrong I would have been the happiest man alive haha. But some guys dont like to just get touched he might like to go slower.|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	Maybe he was embarassed, or just wasn't comfortable with you rubbing his thing. I mean, I'm not a guy, but I'm sure some guys frown upon random chicks rubbing their things in class without asking for it. Who knows..? I don't.|`|EXlGjcwcaa	yeah right.. this never happend|`|chG2vBpQaa	Have you heard of blue balls?
UinOWcMUaa	no, nor should you do this. As role models to our children I don't think that showing them bad habits is a good way to get them ahead in life. Children are a blessing and we should train them up in the paths they should go...        Blessings|`|9GUuVYinaa	Nope, They see Beer in the fridge but I try to not drink when I do in front of them. I mostly drink when they are asleep. Same thing when I smoke, I definitely don't do that in front of them at all. I am not a heavy drinker or even a smoker, but when I do is what I am saying. For example like the superbowl or special occasions.|`|PK0doXNiaa	mine do lol srry im not a parent =P|`|ru9eqfEYaa	yeah. and i let them drink too. only infront of me. (seniors in high school) If they must drink while they are out, i always pick them up if they are leaving. I'd rather know there safe than them be dead, ya know? Because lets face it...they're going to do it regardless.
XRn0Ai3Naa	Yes everyone doubts me all the time and it hurts so much. They always say im never going nowhere because right now i use my looks to get everything but they say watch it ain't gonna work in the long run.But i just keep my head up high and act like i never heard them. A i just worry about doing me and don't worry about everyone else. Also this song right here i swear i love in its my favorite song in the whole world and always keep me happy.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_4tNHyZL...|`|uxfacsgmaa	Not necessarily - although I did have a math teacher tell me that it doesn't matter if I struggle with numbers; 'your husband will look after you', he said to me.     I laughed.     And then I told the principal, and he took a little leave of absence. :)|`|Y3jNg93vaa	yes, my mom.    I just told her i can go as far as i want in my life and i ran outside and took my bike and went on a bike rid into town. Never listen to people when they say that. they just want to make you feel like you need them, and if someone says that to you. then you dont need them. You can go anywhere in your life as long as you work for it.|`|IxP2IMbcaa	Nobody other that that little voice inside my head. Usually when she starts talking, I try to drown her with alcohol. She likes alcohol.|`|VHR2Ff8Caa	Yes.  Often.  The thing is, they are just people that have nothing good to say.  I try WAY harder in school and such than most people I know.  They have no reason at all for telling me that I will fail in life.  They just want to mess with my head,  And basically hurt me.  Oh well...|`|bM4zYt44aa	Of course, most people have been told that by someone in their life.  Best thing you can do is drive on, prove them wrong.  Not saying you should make it your life goal to prove them wrong and then rub in their face, but make it your personal goal to prove them wrong.

That would be cool to walk to!|`|pub2GLZPaa	I am considering Jim Brickman- Angel Eyes    I like Cannon in D, but I think it's too overused, and its too formal for my wedding setting.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQfg6qvij...
cCcEIhEpaa	Today!!    Tada..|`|jp5lfmzTaa	when you get the first opportunity|`|5wAAnZPYaa	Why day only why not time?  all days all time give the mothers"kiss.|`|uY6ro4Qsaa	Any day|`|kuBdwsbIaa	365 days and 24 hours are only for kissing it doesn't need any day....  Enjoy kissing.
Xt7jo8bcaa	Young lady let me tell u something....You are very blessed to have your brother as your best friend...and as u guys grow older and older your friendship will always be strong...You really can't pick your best friend...it just happends with the right person..and your brother is it..sure u will have some cool girlfriends some u will feel closer then others..and maybe a few guy friends as well...But what u are telling us is your brother is your best friend...you told us that u guys respect each other...and u do alot of cool things together...Feel blessed my friend...the next time u see your brother...rather it's going downstairs and he's in the livingroom...or when he comes over to visit...just tell god in your mind...THANK YOU|`|ZgcULXVjaa	I think it's great you and your brother get along so well. As for me, I'm 17 and a half and my brother is eight. Sooo...it's safe to say we're not close like that. Still love him to death though.|`|JFFNFfLeaa	Me and my brother are super best friends! I think there is nothing wrong with it at all.  We even lay in my bed at night together talking after mom goes to sleep.|`|Zi2Sw3ngaa	ehh its not that uncomon..im prety good friends with my sister,...but shes a senior and im a sophmore..but we differ quite abit..|`|fAN2DQJyaa	I don't think it's strange. But I don't hang out with my brother at all. Probably because i'm a girl and he's a boy and we don't share any common interest at all. If we do anything together it's probably video games or eating. ^^;;
ROWNVIUVaa	Oral.....ly tell him you're sorry.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	pretend to cry and tell him your sorry|`|700eb1d0a3c26ec1b6bc612bdaefe114aa	apologize|`|AHLUW1HNaa	Say I sorry I made an *** out of you and me.|`|i0WQzVDZaa	Well you are going to have to just make it clear that you are sorry. Just don't do it when everyone is around watching because it could get embracing if he freaks out. Oh and if he does keep your cool and don't use the **** on him makes you look like a freak.|`|4XCg1mIMaa	give him time he'll come around|`|rI3R0n7eaa	If i only knew...|`|fYTcFygUaa	go out with the guy|`|rsph2L10aa	you could try getting to talk to him straight up or totally shower him with magic love.|`|7IyeOp0xaa	why the **** would you do that?you'll never get him back,he was prolly good to you huh?|`|578e2f7a3fd2ad02982eaa05fbce0dc4aa	Sorry i did not get u|`|xGRh8k2Baa	A really heartfelt apology, as best you can do.  Say how you feel about him and the situation and just hope it's what he wanted to hear.  If it is things should hopefully start getting better, if not, you can try again but good luck, guys can be really dumb and stubborn, trust me I am one and I'm sure I've been both of those at times.  Best of luck though! =)|`|RyApVLzQaa	Just apologize for accusing him.  I'm sure he'll understand if he's your friend. :)
S253XERKaa	he want you why don't you go on that trip with him
VfcZvAbgaa	Awww, that is soooo sad, I feel so bad.  And I thought I had it bad!  I hate my school too, I have some friends but I dont have a set group that I hang out with.  I feel your pain.  You are not alone, I get teased and made fun of too.  I hate it!  I keep thinking.... Just two more years and it will be over.  I hope you can hold on.  I believe in you.|`|OjI51DlDaa	Sorry for your loss, i know you miss him. Im sure not EVERYONE says mean things to you, just look for that certain group/girl or even boy. As for the not doing well in school, first, you need to make sure your organized and paying attention in class, get help whenever needed. Dont slack on work, or goof off. If you keep on track, you can do well in school. Try joining clubs, or sports teams, or anything at your school. But try not to Cry in classes or near anyone, i mean the bathroom is fine. But they may think your weird elsewhere.|`|hf8ldZY8aa	Talk to your teachers about the bullying and have them make an anoucement to your grade (if you dont want to dont say it's from you tell your teachers to say that it's something that they have noticed).Also try joinning clubs or sport teams at your school, find people who share your same interests.And if you really want to know why they dont like you just straight up ask them.i had the same problem once because i made the volleyball team and people keep saying that i wasn't supposed to and that i was the worst player on the team.what i did was i went up to the people that were saying the stuff about me and said to them "just leave me alone clearly the coach put me on the team for a good reason so get over it,and who care if i suck at volleying the ball IM DOING THE BEST I CAN"! if you go up to anyone and say "im doing the best i can" what do you think there going to say"no your not doing the best you can" no there not going to say anything back there just going to fell like ****!
AA10408380	All I can say is that it  takes time. Ur always gonna think of times when it was good. That's how ur brain copes as ur heart heals. Yeah, its weird, but ur heart is a muscle, and as u know, when u excercise, the pain is excrusiating at first, then it gets easier as ur muscles get stronger and can bear the pain. The more u fight it, the worse it might get. So u keep urself busy, and go about ur day. And when u hear that special song, or encounter a sunny day or what not, or see a pic of u two smiling, just look at it. don't read to much into it. Go with the flow. IF that flow is tears, go with it. Let it all loose. In time, u'll look at those pics, have those memories, and be like....oh, this one time...at band camp....! It'll be that simple. No harm, no foul. But the deeper u felt for the person, the more time u were with them, the longer it might take to get over someone. But u will, and u'll be totally happy, all over, instead of happy-sad at times. Good luck.
di6p10Ifaa	Tell them you are trying to keep the numbers in the wedding party small and this is going to be a small event so you feel that a large wedding party may be a bit much for the occasion.|`|bf6K6uubaa	by being honest...say i'd love to share this with you again but i won't be able to have you as a bridesmaid...its a lot different this time and we're broke so we're not making too big of a deal out of everything..we're keeping it small...and they should understand...i mean who asks to be in the wedding thats pretty rude from the get go...and you've already done it all for them once so they should get it|`|WtzKQVGXaa	Just tell them that you would love to have them at the wedding but you will not be having them in the wedding|`|AA11138696	Just tell them that the wedding is going ot be smaller this time and you will not need them to participate in the wedding but you will be thrilled to have them be there as your guests.  IF they really push you tell them the truth.  You had problems with them the last time and you cannot afford to pay for them this time around.|`|E7zBUp3Kaa	Just tell them, but do it to their faces. That way, they can see that you are genuinely upset about this situation.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	For your second wedding, you might want to consider doing what I did at my second wedding:  I didn't have bridemaids nor any other attendants.  It makes things a lot simpler:  No one has to go to the expense of buying attendant clothes, no one has to worry about planning parties, the ceremony is shorter, less photography time, etc.  If you're an over-35 or over-40 second-time bride like I was, IMO having attendants other than one's own children or grandchildren is unnecessary and a bit juvenile.    Then just tell them you're not having attendants, but you'd be delighted to have them as guests.|`|84fd3d15cdfc89d6cb3f984da767d6dbaa	Are you going to have any bridesmaids at all in your wedding? If not, I would tell them that you're not wanting any bridesmaids this time. If you are having bridesmaids, are they going to be family? If so, just tell them you just want family in your wedding. If you aren't going to have just family.. tell them that since they were in your wedding before, you'd like for someone else to be in your wedding this time. Are you still as close as you were to them before? You could tell them that you want to have closer friends in the wedding.  That's weird that they asked you to be in your wedding... normally you're the one asking people if they'd like to be in your wedding. lol That's up to the bride to make those decisions.  I think you should have everyone pay for their own dresses. That's the normal thing to do.. that's what I'm doing. You already have to pay for so much other stuff... you can't pay for their stuff as well when normally they're supposed to pay for it.|`|Gh0qq0s5aa	Just tell them.|`|x7iQb0r3aa	Just be honest, trust me once you tell them the truth you will feel like a huge weight has been lifted off your shoulders and you can get on with planning YOUR wedding. Wedding planning should be fun!!|`|ib2BLbDTaa	First off, What kind of weirdo asks you if they can be in your wedding?? That's solely up to the bride, and as far as girl code goes, almost a sign of how much your friendship means to the bride. Second off, unless your planning on going bridezilla on everyones ***, you should have everyone pay for their own dresses.  Just don't make the cost ridiculous or anything.  I'm sure they've already considered having to pay for airfare to get to your wedding so ultimately it's up to you on how you want to handle things.  This is why weddings are the single most selfish celebrations ever! You invite a bunch of guests to watch you parade around in your love filled day while you call all the shots. Congrats!!!|`|ZeFyWGOCaa	Get a spine. Tell them you're touched, but that you can't plan for them to be in the wedding party. You don't have to explain. Thank them, and say no.|`|ySqz9g1Gaa	write a letter to them  write a e-mail|`|zKU0qUyHaa	just tell them you don't want bridesmaids or if you already have bridesmaids tell them you already picked them and you are only having a certain number?|`|vwxmsUa2aa	Are you having any bridesmaids at all?  If not, I'd just tell them that you and your fiance have decided to have a small wedding and not have any bridal party.  If you are having other bridesmaids, just tell them you and your fiance have decided to have a small wedding and only have family in the bridal party (or whatever it is that fits your situation).    Tell them that you really appreciate how excited they are about the wedding and that you'd still love them to attend.|`|tBODwcqXaa	It is actually traditional for bridesmaids to pay for their own dress, etc. Just say something like, "we are trying to keep the wedding budget to a minimum, so I am going to ask that the wedding party pay for their own expenses. I will understand if that changes your mind about being in my wedding." Good luck!
ddWyRjmVaa	yes|`|HPftG1EOaa	it depends but if you doing it to all your guy friends then you might just sound slutty. and some guys dont find that attractive at all.|`|COmp4sIuaa	It's fun. No, if I'm joking, I don't develop feelings for the person I'm joking with.    Now, if it's suggestive joking, then I may start liking them.
oyrIbGwzaa	he's passionate for you.|`|oLI2SJ08aa	He's focusing on the kiss. It's normal to keep your eyes closed.|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	most people close their eyes as a "reaction"  some people find it weird for the other person to have their eyes open|`|m3QhZcCHaa	he is enjoying the kiss.... duh and btw  IT IS RUDE TO STARE|`|N53oHiwNaa	i think everyone that kisses closes there eyes lol its awkward to just stare .....watch some tv and observe if you want to seee|`|3rDbLSZBaa	when you kiss your supposed to keep your eyes closed to feel and express the moment through your lips. if you keep your eyes open you just think about staring at him and not the kiss|`|wFtL7OTpaa	um... you are kinda supposed to close your eyes when you kiss it is like insane if you don't... its like a habit and you are definitely supposed to close them... hate to break it to ya, but you are the weird one here...|`|qQsjM6O3aa	its kinda creepy to keep your eyes open....|`|088b2f23da252d7364143178b0433b20aa	It means he enjoying the kiss. He's getting into it and trying to please you more by focusing. You may want to mention to him that you think it's sexy if he keeps his eyes open.|`|rmXDZy3Eaa	It means he is comfortable and trusts you. This is usually normal for someone to close their eyes, so don't worry. It also means he is trying to make it romantic? I guess that's the word lol.|`|Zi8M3qrBaa	its just a thing 99% of people do
kE2CuYP3aa	If he really likes you.Then u shouldn't be worried but if he's been avoiding u..... I think u shouldn't let him talk to u tomarrow tell him u want to no now.|`|mefxIQP9aa	First you need to calm down. Tomorrow, just act normal and don't ask him if he's made a decision yet. That makes you look desperate and he might get annoyed. Just give him time to decide.|`|PBDXgNBgaa	..this to be honest is kinda crazy im just being honest. if he said he will tell you tomorrow then that's what its going to be you can't change it and no you shouldn't be scared. the question you should have asked is. where are we going tomorrow. this would have let you know that yes we are going out. he then would have probably said i'll tell you tomorrow..then you would feel excited..|`|Ss4bkvDgaa	okay , well first relax. (:  if he doesn't wanna go out with you  anymore, then he's probaly not the guy  for you at all, i'd move on then. there's a lot  of fishies in the sea. & If he does wanna go out  with you , then good! :) oh!& make sure you  wear something super cute tomorrow when you see  him. ( :|`|5BlWxijkaa	if he says no just relax and take your mind off of it its fine i bet hes gonna say yes tho|`|EpOU7vGYaa	hes shy, go kiss him on the cheek or lips and say i love you|`|1y1zmbkvaa	This sounds like a yes, maybe he is going to do something special tomorrow. The best thing to do is relax and not think about. Have some fun!|`|Zw52BAgQaa	why did you ask if you were still going our for?    its obvious then that something happened.    maybe you had a =fight or somehting.    He sounds like an idiot if he has to think about it.    Tell him he took too long and your over him lol    again,  good luck chicky
xZOHlSXsaa	Make sure that he doesn't get swayed by other people and you should be ok.    Just don't let other people convince you or him it's a bad idea - you're in love. Why let them spoil it?    The others may have religious issues with your relationship. If they do then it's none of their business. If they don't then they're just being harsh and, as above, it's none of their business.    If it is really getting to you then you should see somebody with authority at your school or perhaps ask your friends to help.    Hope this helps =)
d0WK1j47aa	go for the nuts|`|kLslWQR8aa	Just let it go the more you show him that it bugs you the more he'll do it.
sGESw6v0aa	I dont know how long you have been married, or where you went off track as a couple, but I believe you have your priorities mixed up.  A husband and wife are there to fulfill the others needs, yes, that includes sex.  You need to understand the male psychology.  To him sex is love, and you are refusing him of love. How then can he say a bunch of nicities to you in that situation??  Is it that he does nothing at all to make life easier for you?  Perhaps your focus on the kids dealt him out of your family picture.    Let me give you a brutal picture of what I mean.  My wife has been out of town with my family for three weeks to help my parents.  When she comes home she will want to be hugged and talked to, and want conversation.  Frankly all I want is to drain my loins, and then we can talk or whatever.  Contrary to what you might do, my wife will understand this phenomena that men have, and meet my needs, and then she will get all the accolaids for being a loving and caring wife.  I love my wife dearly, and would do anything for her, but it in reality is based on her attitude towards me.    You have all the power to change your situation.  Talking to him about your feelings will do no good until he has received your love, ie, sex.  I will take more than just one day to accomplish this, but if you continue day after day to be kind, and caring you should see a change sooner than you think.  Remember, your spouse comes before children.    I dont say what I have based on the man is always right, but the fact that I have been happily married for 31 years, and my wife through her giving as well as receiving has been the source of my happiness  Good luck|`|7foornMVaa	Good sex = good marriage    Bad/no sex = bad marriage.      One does not go with out the other.    Women and men view marriage and sex different.  You want the nice convos and he wants the nice sex.  Cant you both compromise?|`|W1rCsvTzaa	This is a hard situation for both of you.  If you asked him what caused the downward spiral in your marriage what would he say?      Sometimes in these situations the man says, my wife was ignoring me sexually and so I got more and more frustrated, communication suffered, she then cut me off completely etc.      Was he "happy" with your sex life "before" things got strained?  Or a different way of asking this is how did you get to this point.   By the way I have never cheated in 20 years of mostly happy married life.  But if we got to separate bedrooms I would have seriously considered that as an option and I am a really committed guy.      He WILL NOT stay with you open ended without sex, he will either cheat, leave or both.|`|CuJjdTVXaa	well I wish you the best. Having sex isn't a requirement but merely a sign of one persons love for the other by sharing their body with you. It seems that over time we lose sight of that and it becomes more or a thing we do to pass the time. Your husband feels as if hes lost something, you feel you have too but the difference is he wants the sex and you want the compassion. Talking at this point may be the last thing he wants, try just sitting together one on one and be open and honest with him about what you want from him, ask him to do the same and see if you can start with a middle point instead of two opposite ends. I do wish you the best and good luck|`|96HWpdkFaa	Sex can be very helpful to a relationship. Don't just fck actually make love, YES THERE IS A DIFFERANCE! Try buying a game called "hot affiar" it's a sex game, but the questions start out with love..you go through different levels of love. the last cards are the most sexual. The other ones are nice and fun, like "what do you love most about your wife or husband?" What is your favorite quality about your spouse?"  things like that. It's nice to hear..you get what you want and he gets what he wan't in the end. Sometimes it's hard for guys to express things.|`|QSodlfMraa	well to some people it mine be, but i suggest marriage counselor.|`|WewCtMpzaa	Not all marriages are about sex, but your husband is into sex, so whether you like or dislike, your marriage has a sexual component.    You need to take apart what really bothers you, and communicate that. Insist on things you like, and not be the one always serving, or giving. If you are not getting something in return, it will be a chore.    There are so many things that can make a person less sexual these days. So many people are overweight, and that effects libido. Having kids can kill the mood. Having financial problems, and anything stressful in your life can kill the mood. If sleep sounds more exciting, you are wanting that for the same reasons your husband wants sex. It makes them happy, and content.    If he goes without sex for too long, he will begin to notice others, and resent that he has to go with out, or has to always go solo. That will make it rougher then.|`|m13CCGc1aa	Make the sex about you.  If you are having libido issues, it might be hormone related.  Talk to your dr about it.  With the vast majority of women, there is something about sex that they like even if they can't orgasm.    Get some toys.  Initiate sex when you are in the mood.  Maybe get a naughty video and some toys.  Try to have sex four or five times a week for several weeks.  Don't let it be about him.  Don't end the sex session until you are satisfied.|`|sbfJ3ma6aa	How long has the marriage been going on?  If its been a shirt marriage then maybe yall will be able to work things out. If its been a long time marriage then maybe something has changed for him but NO you dont need to be involved in a relationship for only sex.|`|5jMNBO2naa	so what started the no sex strike in the first place?  you know of course women hold that power to themselves  and that is the power to hold back  and then manipulate a guy    so resentment builds in  eventually on both sides    he will not listen much less care about your feelings  so as long as you use sex as a weapon  you of course will see him as krass and uncaring  so the stalemate will continue    the problem is now you see sex as some sort of an ugly thing  and thus you justification for holding back on it    so if he ends up cheating  don''t be surprised    divorced will eventually be the outcome    as for your answer    yes is sex is vital to a marriage, as it is an intimate and physical bonding    lack of it and you get what you got now  and the children, stuck in the middle, suffer|`|tcyuTHjPaa	My suggestion is find one day when you both have off work,get a baby sitter and make him remember why you both got married.I promise it will work.Good luck.|`|3frK2iHaaa	UR Q is SEX a requirement in marriage?YES IT IS ,so plz dont ruined ur marriage coz u hv sm disagreements n communication problems.start doing the good stuff from today 4 U N UR KIDS N 4 ur relationship.if kids r so important than do it 4 them.first thing first put sm smile on ur face n get dressed v nicely just like u dressed 4 ur dates ,when u see urself in the mirror it will put a smile on u by watching ur self looking so beautiful.after tht lights off candles on,,lol...do it 4 two or 3 weeks u will get the conversation back ..TRY IT.....)|`|LMIbr1aeaa	your joking right?  A good healthy sex with the marriage spouse calms your nerves, frustrations, stress, pressure, insomnia, less panic attacks, less headaches, less irritated.   It really helps with the imperfections, weaknesses, flaws and defects of the spouse, of the not so perfect marriage relationship. GL|`|sR6vhbataa	It's not a "requirement" but I agree no / very-low frequency / bad sex generally means a marriage that has problems. This is a gross simplification, but the trouble is, women can't hop into bed without feeling close first, and men can't feel close without hopping into bed first. So you are in a stalemate. It's going to take some time to turn this around.     Perhaps some kind of agreement could be reached, where you ask for regular conversation and doing things together as a couple, and he asks for a renewal of your sex life? Counseling may be in order. Good Luck.
3F6brF2xaa	if a person love his or her partner thats a wonderful traits for me i love my man always wt me hug kiss and everything and i dont think wat people say and last thing i wont let him out n my sight wt out any reason|`|ZvoN0Knvaa	if he doesnt show and expression....  hes annoyed.
mAZi1eH7aa	Would I date them? No. I am happily married to a wonderful lady and am heterosexual. However, I do not judge anyone for their personal choices. It does not hurt anyone else and happiness and love are their personal business.
7THgBSvfaa	I just asked myself that same question because I saw some other girls picture.. Aren't they worried they will get a low rating or something too? I would probably never put a picture of myself up..|`|76nTvO4iaa	I would, but I don't think they care.|`|XTFlgAcWaa	no, what are the odds from some1 at ur school also being a member of ya? very unlikely. next question.|`|eQaApazjaa	ahahaha i know! i used to do that sometimes..my questions wouldnt be 'am i pretty' they would be like what haircut should i get or w.e..so it wouldt THAT bad if someone i knew saw...    but one time i was on here in the beauty section and a girl that goes to my school (shes a senior) posted her picture and asked if she was pretty ahahahahha. so now im never doing that again  !|`|i7rYRvlTaa	haha yeah but what are the chances of that happening?|`|1uvrkDWNaa	Not just someone they know, probably their neighborhood sex offender.|`|J5Mevbz7aa	yaaaaa so true   this is the best question actually|`|ww9k3Bk7aa	hahaha thats exactly what i was thinking. that would be really embarrising if some they knew say dont you think? lol|`|VfcZvAbgaa	I was totally just thinking that!!! I was thinking about what peeps would say and then I thought.... wait what if someone i know saw me.  That would be really awkward!  Great minds think alike!!!!!!   :)|`|kLslWQR8aa	Nope cause it doesn't really matter at all does it|`|L38M9lrLaa	i think the same thing i would be embarrassed if i couldnt get any one and i was so desperate i resolved to going online and asking people i dont know to rate me and ask if there interested..ridiculous|`|3frIC80naa	i just think that there's a lot of people on here that have low self esteem. (i feel bad cuz they just need assurence that they dont look how they think they do) idk why cuz most of the time they look good.  whatever the reason. i wouldn't be scared of some1 saw my pic unless it was XXX. lol. :)|`|EE9F6q3Jaa	i'm terrified of that happening.  this summer i posted a question on here asking for help with a summer assignment and some girl answered it from my school.  i was new to the school that year and i didn't know anybody, and on the first day she heard my name and we were in the same class that i asked the question about and was like "were you the girl who asked that question on yahoo answers"  and i was just like :o yeahh...|`|eVK2zZsOaa	I guess if they put there picture up, they don't care if somebody they know sees it.|`|hL4XVuvIaa	yeah so would i. or a pedophile who knows how to hack computers and get all your info out of this site|`|cVSwO3Uzaa	what are the chances? 1 in 100million?|`|RvFwmQOPaa	I agree with you and also it is very dangerous as hell. Do these people not realize how many sick perverted people use the internet to prey on people? Its also shows a lack of self esteem if you need a group of strangers to rate your looks. Just like you may not think someone is going to see it but if you're a member of Y&A, what makes you think that the next person you know is not a member. Some people can also be very vain about their looks and may just need a bunch of people to show approval....how sad!|`|gC8xO53Oaa	They want them to see them. I don't know why anyone would want to be rated or compromise their friendship if competing with a friend, but I guess they just need confirmation of what they think of themselves. I hope that a rating would not hurt their feelings, but that's the chance they take when asking.
CdDM0Xtaaa	Yes it is a good idea I have the same problem with my mother and I moved out when I was 18 teen and she wouldn't do nothing for me so I got my own place when I was 20 and she still don't care about me as much as she cares about my brother who doesn't do nothing but use and yell all the time and he still lives with her and he drooped out of school and I fin shed school but they still love him my whole family does.|`|76nTvO4iaa	You graduate in May, right?    Save every spare cent you can find.  Wait until you graduate and have a job before you move out.    ((hugs))|`|jxpV13rTaa	i moved out when i was young..as long as you have a decent paying job and are mature enough to handle living on your own its fine. but if you are weary about moving out then wait a bit. its not the same as living at home, everything that needs to be done has to be done by you, and you need to have time for it all. its probably a better idea to wait, but if your that desperate, get a job first, find a place close to that job and go from there.|`|8y8PpQvnaa	Well how about you graduate and find a job before you try doing that. These are the early years of your financial responsibility, if you screw them up big then you may be spending the next 15 years righting your momentary and unthought out wrongs.
smujlQLcaa	well give him space and make him come to you.  Sounds mess up but just try to change it up.  Make him want to spend more time with you|`|uBssj3Znaa	because he had a life before you and he doesn't need you around every second of the day. It doesn't mean he doesn't like you. You should hang out with your friends.|`|phWUBtviaa	Maybe he thinks you are suffocating him.  It is completely fine if you dont see each other everyday.  Its not healthy to see each other everyday when starting a relationship with someone.  you still have your own friends and family to be around.  and you need time to yourself.  Besides, if he doesnt see you all the time, it will give him a chance to miss you.|`|MfUMaKcDaa	maybe he thinks your too clingy|`|cmEi3CVqaa	he needs some space|`|Azp6bBazaa	couples dont need to hang out everyday.  i live with my bf, and sometimes i dont even see him. lol. we work different hours. and basically we only see eachother upon going to sleep and waking up , but were happy & in love thats what matters.    youre being "clingy" .and he has a life seperate from you.  you need to have one seperate from him.  get a job. hang out with your friends. join a club. something to keep you from being "lonely"     its not a bad thing. trust me =]|`|xJaG2lMxaa	maybe your just eing clingy. just give him some space for a few days, and definitely dont make a big deal of it. try to refrain from him, its hard, but u can do it|`|KHsWu1zbaa	He's telling you to stop being so clingy; in an indirect way.    "When I'm away from him I feel so lost."    Hun, this isn't healthy. You need to be able to function on your own without him.    He probably feels smothered and is trying to be nice about it, that he really doesn't want to hang with you every single day. He probably is missing hanging out with the guys.    Don't be so dependent.|`|3frIC80naa	he needs space, time to hang out with his own friends or family. and maybe you do to. if your with him all the time your probably not paying that much attention to your own friends which makes them feel pretty sh!ty. so just give him his space for a day or two and let him do his thing and u do urs.|`|QCWPulqqaa	It means you're smothering him.  If you don't give him time alone, pretty soon you will have NONE of his time.
I08iONdaaa	How old are you? you aren't "in love", btw. Not to negate your feelings or anything, but love is something that evolves through a committed relationship. This guy fulfills some conscious/unconscious ideal that you have and that's why you're attracted to him. Because you haven't really gotten to be the him, you're more in love with an imagined relationship with him than him himself. I know it's hard not to beat yourself up over the potential of what "could have been", but I think that's the main thing you're struggling with. I would say you're deeply attracted to him, but not in love with anything more than an imagined ideal. There's nothing wrong with that, but don't let it hang you up too much. You might miss out on somebody just as good who doesn't mind your quietness. I mean, seriously, do you really want a guy who can't handle you being yourself?       Hang in there! :)|`|7e8be8f471de4c60d8884f52a597ddc2aa	You only went out once can you imagine if you would of had a second date.  Just let him see you around and smile and be very positive around and let him know what he's missing out in.|`|i7rYRvlTaa	well what can you do?   he already has a gf so get over it.|`|E3t5BcZgaa	he's just a crush i mean its not like ur the first one to have a crush on some guy and if u like him that much tell him ask him out and this time try to talk. but seriously its not love|`|y5P4dY7aaa	Uh no!|`|BopBYwSdaa	slow reflect for being in love huh?  If he's already hold someone hands...maybe you should do too     If nothing effect how you feel from last year till you saw him with someone else.. then it might not be love... you just feel LOST someone who love you (kind of silent ego)... but that's normal we are all human.. If you love this guy, you should be so heartbrokern when you 2 broke up alredy    why now?|`|YyFexhd3aa	you have to get over him mate your love will just make you suffer|`|MgiGZ51Zaa	Talk alot not like a chatter box and tell him how you feel i am sure he will understand|`|Azp6bBazaa	youre not in love. [love is much more complicated]    i think you strongly like this guy & seeing him with another girl while you have no one sparked up feelings of jealousy. and makes you think that you miss him when you actually dont.    how to solve this:   go get yourself a boyfriend. but not this guy. because if he broke up with you because you dont talk enough, you deserve someone much much better than that.|`|009Fbd1caa	Love is tricky, and if you are it is very unfortunate that it didn't work last time. However, my general opinion on this sort of situation is that if it didn't work the first time you were together it is probably never going to work for the same reasons. But girl play the field, make him jealous..there is probably lots of lads that like you but don't say anything cause you are hung up on this one boy.    Try it, go for it :)  Good luck xx|`|zhs5Cy5vaa	I think you should get over him, I mean he's with another girl right now.  : /|`|vgcaJgGhaa	i think its just a crush, only you would know if you loved him. but you need to get over him.|`|7GQuGVzmaa	awww i know how u feel it hurts knowing a guy like someone else.but here's something my mum always says 'if you really love someone you let them be happy even if they aren't being happy with you' and i think shes right.i know you love him but wait if he breaks up with this girl tell him how you feel and he might feel the same way.just make sure he loves you back|`|ORaAPCrsaa	hmm.. i think you're in a state of confusion. just try to think of it all over again.. until you finally realized that you do still like him.. :)|`|Fu9tlKbhaa	It's a crush...trust me darlin. If he has a girl...move on..it stinks I know..but just do it. Go out with your friends, have a good time, it will help you get over him. Don't revolve your life around some guy that already has a g/f. Don't waste your time.|`|347e90513d241183aae7c3fa2356bf0aaa	i dKN if ur in love but u need to snap out of it.if he doesnt feel the same way|`|9PICw7L6aa	dude, fine a better guy.,...  theres always someone better, believe me i went through the same thing..  but i finally got over him and found someone so much better and appreciates me more.  you will find someone else, since he found someone and moved on.. you should do the same    ..|`|gC8xO53Oaa	I think you're just infatuated with him. Love takes a lot more than a 1  time date. He's got a gf sweetie, so set your sights on one that's right for you.|`|z0nLFAL9aa	Girlfriend, honestly I think you should just tell him how you feel, don't go on to strong, but just become friends with him, and tell him how you really feel. You many not get him, but it doesn't hurt to try. And DO NOT i repeat DO NOT do stuff with him when he is with someone else, he is just using you. && I don't think you are in love, it might just be lust or you might just really like him.    Good luck, darling.|`|btghmpQhaa	i say you are deffinatly in love
fBbrDGA7aa	The people in here are not giving you enough credit. I say you are at least an 8 in every pic. I would totally date you if I had the chance. send me an email sometime, if you want to talk or see a pic.|`|a5b774126a207d8d38e9c6854bb56b66aa	i say you are about an 8 u look about 15 to me and no not gay but might not wanna ask that 3rd question on here anyways might be some perverts or malestors on here|`|uZpLhQf2aa	It always bothers me when little girls ask this question. It doesn't matter what a bunch of creepy guys think, it matters how you feel. And never ask if people are interested, of course someone is, guys are perverts. You are a pretty girl, but you shouldn't need us to tell you that!|`|Kr2cTfRAaa	girl u look hot if u are 15-16 i am interested and if u want to see me send a message and i will send a picture of me i rate u a 10|`|CtDBQwzaaa	your butt a** ugly bitc*|`|y2QOZjnJaa	1.)

I would guess you are about 15 - 17 not to sure but I'm sure you will find somebody good luck|`|MfUMaKcDaa	aw you're really pretty! you look 17|`|RHllkmBpaa	Im not a guy but your preeety!|`|1afDi8K5aa	u look diffrent in every pic, id say a 6.5  u look 14|`|SldrawoLaa	I'm not a lesbian but gals are more honest at these things right?    1) I'd say you are a 8/9  2) 16/17  3) Not me not a lesbian!!|`|KzkErmaaaa	your really pretty. i give u a 9. and i would be interested if i actually knew you in person. and if i did know you in person we would be going out already =p|`|JEqt3dDRaa	i REALLY like the last one of you. your deff. about a 8.5!!    your reallly pretty!!! be confident..|`|24e0235a290bef2c8d4bf35df8dd40c6aa	Well I hate all the angles you have but...     1) I'd say about a 6.5     2) 14 or 15     3.)

UH7lQSoiaa	Well that is a chance you really have to be willing to take. I think it is a cardinal rule that if you choose to get involved with someone and they have something that they do you do not like you really cannot ask them to give it up. Maybe if there is a way he can run his business or communicate with the girls that would make you more comfortable you should bring that up but that's if the two of you are going to get serious.Otherwise I just recommend you take it slow and scope out the situation.|`|v53eCpPkaa	nothing you can "do" about it as it's his business.be honest and both of you will feel better about whatever happens,and have the best chance of being friends in the long term.  avoid judging him or the women who do the work,just say it's not "you" to date someone in this business.     it's not like he's done anything wrong,you have all the facts and it's up to you to choose whether to go there. if you get more serious,it's always going to bug you.if you say you cant handle it and stop dating him, then he quits the gig (really),you have found out what he's made of!|`|nMkDpEQJaa	.: Are you strong enough to accept his kind of business? :.    .: Can you fully give your trust to him? :.    .: Are you a jealous type of person? :.    .: Those are the question you should answer 1st, be honest :.    .: Work with him to learn how he manage things (if he's open to it) so you'd get a feel on how his days are spent normally :.    .: Things will workout if your confident with yourself and what you can offer into the relationship you're about to enter :.    ? Good Luck!|`|mAZi1eH7aa	The problem is not with him, it is with you. Take him as he is and accept it, or don't bother. It is how you feel that counts here. He is who he is and has presented himself to you. You will not change that. Only he can, when he chooses to. So the decision is completely based on how you feel. None of us can answer that without knowing much, much more.|`|9sEM4i5Kaa	I don't think I could handle that. I would worry because men are men, they aren't dogs, but they have that sex drive that they are born to have.. and putting themselves in a position of temptation is bad. There will be girls who want to kiss bosses butt, and be teachers pet so to speak. And even the best man cannot hold back all the time. seems risky. cause then you have your heart at risk, and your body.
TcyaA0Y4aa	Just go up to her and say hi and introduce yourself to her
HNjNWHSyaa	well you obviously have never seen me lol but thanks for lying|`|8QJJGZY3aa	Well since you don't know me.......you havent.  But thanks for the compliment lol. =]]]
uuDSix48aa	Tell them you wont do anything stupid after prom like drinking, drugs, sex  get a curfew time|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	Tell them that you are almost an adult and being "protective" like they are is not going to benefit either one of you.  Make an agreement with them (like you will be home earlier, etc.) and talk calmy with them.|`|VP2fsPWzaa	well try to be very good that day and when you wanna talk to them do your best to look cute... you know big innocent eyes with a drop of tear to make them shiny....well it works most of the time ;-)

8rTAfF1maa	best thing to do is fight back. ignoring her isnt going to make her stop, its gonna get worse the next day.|`|RAPeNncwaa	I know it'll be annoying and hard to, but just let it be.

She acting like she is in preschool or elementary school talking about someone so i wouldn't worry bout it|`|YG4VMafEaa	Maybe she is just conceited and think you're staring at her and all when you're not. Or maybe she's a homosexual herself but she don't like to let it show and instead try to act like it's someone else.

If she does corner you, call her on being a bully, we all know its not cool, hopefully she will back off.

Give her a kiss, don't wait for her to kiss you. Hold her hand in the hallways. Carry her books once in a while. Be sweet to her. Call her or text her. anything to show you really care about her. Girls appreciate it.|`|p3WITGwPaa	Think of something creative that you know she'd love (you know her interests, not us!). You could take her for a picnic (if you live in the south, lol) or try cooking for her, for example (most girls think it's cute and sweet if you cook for us, even if you can't cook and it turns out crappy!! -- have your mom give you ideas if needed). The thing, however, is not to smother her! The most annoying thing in the world is for a guy to be TOO sweet or TOO romantic. Do something unexpected and nice every once in ahile, but not every other day. As for her, there's nothing you can do to get her to show you that she likes you 'a little more'. She either will or won't! For instance, I'm a girl that isn't touchy feely or nowhere near romantic, but that doesn't mean I don't love my boyfriend. I just show him in different ways. On a side note, girls tend to work better w/ words and guys w/ actions. Make sure you're listening. :)
z0nLFAL9aa	honey, you just reached puberty way too fast. You need to slow down, and deff. not do anything, wait till your 16.

RehsHaTBaa	well, if u have hot boobs, he'll definitely go 4 it. here's what i told someone else who had the same question:  wear tight tops like tanks or bra-less camis that show the top of ur boobs.  wear shirts bra-less  give him a tight hug while wearing the tight top but no bra.   bring his arms around ur back and onto your boobs, put his hands under ur shirt.   idk how old u r, but while having sex find a way 2 do it?  wear v-neck shirts but still go bra-less   um, go 2 the pool in a tight and revealing bikini, when u go home, keep the bikini on the whole day and rub against him.  good luck!|`|XTFlgAcWaa	show them to him.|`|7e4jxj3Daa	That's got to be a first. He doesn't want to grab your boobs. It's usually the opposite.|`|Kr2cTfRAaa	grab his hand and rub them on ur boobs|`|eX8i4vwRaa	when your making out, take his hand and press it against them with your hand on top of his.  simple :)|`|hOeZaPTyaa	put on a tight shirt or cami but braless and hug him, grab his hand and put it against ur boobs and start rubbing it for him, he will understand ;)|`|bUDIUbcyaa	show them to him|`|ccc5f6c8137b10489fe1f263b0d9b516aa	grab his hand... put it on ur boobs. he'll like the aggresiveness ;)
aSSXt6tlaa	My daughter is 18 and has had her license for a month.  She has 1 parking ticket, she tried to drive in the snow with a car full of kids (she grounded now) and she ran her car into my garage (idiot).  Her insurance is $160 per month.    Driving is a lot of responsiblity.
7BRJhrABaa	do a bonfire together with marshmellows,strawberries,chocolate and get all cozy and spend a good time there ..its short but thats wat comes to mind ..oh and get in a jacuzzy after it|`|QqGhOaIJaa	A really nice diner  by a cozy fire. Its a lot more romantic if you guys are alone
UgcPxd4maa	If the person has never gotten roses, they would most likely like them!|`|z5Wxwtrfaa	roses are always special
aMgmTN3zaa	First.. How old are you???  Second.. If he's gonna dump you, then you don't need him.. I know that's hard to hear.. but you don't need that heartbreak.. You need someone who will genuinely care for you...   Maybe you should back off from relationships for awhile..Just have fun and hang out with your friends :) You don't have to worry about a broken heart there..  I know it's what everyone says, but trust me.. Take some time to breathe, just have fun! Stay out of relationships until you're older.. but even then, it's hard to deal with heartbreak!   The best medicine in this situation is merely going out with friends and having fun! go out with your gal pals and have a sleepover.. eat junk food and have fun! Nothing works better :)  Good luck hun!
8pDAuPT4aa	depends on the woman, but i think it means pretty much the same thing as when a man flirts with a woman|`|7PGxqRfZaa	Well it makes me as a men feel wanted. It nice once in a while to have a women flirt with you. I like flirting with women, and guys like it as well. But not as much. It shows a guy that your interested in him. Its a good feeling knowing your wanted. Good luck.|`|iD4ejChZaa	to get him to think she's pretty and probably ask her out.|`|HPqCRBq8aa	It could means a lot of things. Mostly good though, but it also could be a bad thing. For most women, it a way to see if the person is interested in them.|`|ulfcg8hVaa	usually it means the LIKE that guy. It is a natural human emotion to find someone attractive.    Okay now the real answer: If you think that a woman cant flirt with a guy you are wrong. My best friends mom actually PROPOSED to her husband. So the point of a woman flirting with a man is so that she can get his attention.
ldzDqqUcaa	no|`|7e4jxj3Daa	Your height is no problem but I find the same as you, they prefer blonde blue eyed guys it seems.|`|KlSjISoQaa	no, if you like her go for it, women like different things in men|`|7GQuGVzmaa	im asian and a girl and no we don't only like white guys with blonde hair.we like any guys that's sweet good looking etc.Don't think just coz of what you might of saw.|`|wF8tea9Daa	I have no idea.  Every person will have a different preference when it comes to looks and what they like.  Personally, I like darker hair and light-colored eyes.  I think that combination is very attractive, although I've seen some cute blondes.    I am asian but born in U.S.  I know if you were walking around in Japan or Korea, you'd get lots of looks and stares even if you're not blonde because it would be pretty obvious you're not asian.  (I know, I used to live in Korea and I used to see this when a white person, male or female, was walking down the street....).      So, it'll all depend on each individual person.  As to whether you're too tall, again, that is subjective and will vary from person to person.

How about you talk to them in real life and see whats up with it?|`|YG4VMafEaa	Maybe you go on the computer more often than they do because I have a friend who hasn't checked his e-mail since last April. Or maybe you had a typo and put in the wrong adress. Maybe they made a new account and just forgot to tell you about it. Try calling them. :-)
1eh7GMM2aa	just tell him you heard about what happened that you are there for him.

Lap dance rocks, all the guys (including my boyfriend) enjoy it a lot : )|`|DQ5nx7GEaa	yea, i always wanted to give my bf a lapdance, and i did, it felt great, and after i grabbed his penis and he was in heaven, he had sex with em and he licked me, omg its the best, go ahead do it|`|kfsUgEjxaa	If you're 17 or older, yeah.  Other than that, too young I'd say.  I personally would sure as hell enjoy a lap dance more than flowers or chocolate, but that's just me.|`|G4KKm0IOaa	Yea,you could make a mixed tape of sexy,seductive music,and put as many songs as you want the lapdance to last,and wear something seductive and sexy.Don't show too much,but just enough,you could look up videos on youtube|`|dZ3X26EOaa	yea u should.it will make your relationship better.my gf did that for me last year and i liked it but be careful it most likely turn into something else

Lemme tell you, I didn't wanna go back to school and I still cry about it today.    Please. Don't do this to him. It really hurts. Think of it this way: How would you like it if it was done to you?|`|FVt8c0cxaa	Okay try to know who he likes because it helps to turn to be more like that girl, if you know what he likes such as a sport then try to play it and give it a chance.And don't tell him you like him let him get to like you.

Just state your interests... "I really like you and was wondering if you'd like to hang out this weekend?" etc.    You could chat him up and find out about what he likes/dislikes (hobbies, bands, so on) if you don't already know much about him    You could dress in sexy clothes and make sure to "accidentally" rub up against him at times. But that is kind of slutty.|`|45b12e3a23b254dfa86c1f9333066f2daa	Are you really as ridiculous as this question makes you seem?  You use people like this?

yTB2Zdx6aa	shes either messing with you or she is trying to warn you about this boy|`|61Wrl89Maa	Just talk to him.
lIoDmnvEaa	Better to do it personally.
fdP9UJOsaa	Well that wasn't very nice, She shouldn't of grabbed you're balls like that, you could of been seriously hurt. Your mom on the other hand should of showed some sympathy for you and found out if you were alright.  To answer your question, NOT ALL ladies are cruel... your mom and that instructor weren't serious about the whole situation. Have a talk with both your mom and the instructor. Start out with the instructor by telling her that what you did was an accident. Then explain to your mom exactly what happened and tell her that she hurted your feeling by taking up for the instructor. I'm pretty sure that didn't mean to make fun of you on purpose.    Feel better soon :-)
AA10426969	...His nerves will be sensitive at first, and you have a hymen to bust.|`|Ipw8hlEuaa	short because he will ejaculate fast  and has to build resistance to it so he can have sex longer    thats the best way i could explain it..
19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	I think you need to concentrate on your education and forget about him.  That way you do not become yet another uneducated, unwed teen mommy on welfare.  Sooner rather than later he's going to want to have sex w/ you.  Which could land him in jail for statutory rape.  Unless of course he's got some one of age on the side that he's doing.  Distinct possiblity.  Anyway stick to guys your own age and keep your legs shut.|`|nGGDddyUaa	isn't that illegal? your 14 1/2 and he's 19? he should be in jail by now|`|ixsUWp5Aaa	i know how u feel   he is prolly your first true love..  he do have true feeling for u   if didnt ask for sex yet. but u have to   understand that your only 14 and there  are going to be more guys that your going   to be interested in a frew years from now  or maybe sooner!! i wouldn't want to be in a   relationship with a guy if i have to sneak around with   him just to see him.you and him might have to stay friends  talk this out together because this is a hard situation|`|b70DKNLvaa	the same exact thing hapened to me the same exact but i wouldnt dare tell my mom and i got in a fight with his ex and he got back with her and my heart was broken for  2 months and i found someone better and he wants me but im still with my new bf that was like feb. o8|`|0pJh5bnaaa	Honestly.. This is normal "teenage relationship" stuff.. But the main thing is the age difference.. Im sorry but a 19 year old boy is on a totaly diff level than a 14 year old girl.. That's just the reality of things. And when I was 14 I "loved" someone.. Lucky for me I didn't get all wrapped up an start having sex and stuff like that (wait! If you haven't already done it!) like your young and you are in a totally different mindset than him.. An than you will be once you get older.. Please don't think your in love. Trust me you will regret it later.. Lol or be very embarrassed. Plus myspace?? I mean honestly your too young to EVER go meet up with ANYONE you meet pver the internet. There are all sorts of ppl out there who prey on young girls like you.. An im not even trying to use the age thing against you (I used to hate that) but with age comes wisdom.. Your mom is RIGHT|`|3ba3d366710c221dbd1c68c4c6c1b3ddaa	Ok some people are harsh and obviously don't remember being 14, but, still, they have a point. So does your mom. There are safety issues here. Not only your emotional well being (sounds like a lot of trouble to sneak around obsessively with this guy) but also your sexual health. WAIT WAIT WAIT. Also, a 19 year old who is meeting  you off myspace is immediately suspect in my or any other rational, thinking woman's mindset. You have to wonder what an ADULT is thinking when he engages a teenager in this way... Get some clarity on the situation before you forge ahead...sometimes if you let things go, they work out better than you planned. So let this guy go think about what YOU really want for a bit. Good Luck :)|`|aI2V5xDGaa	If your parents are against it and your a minor and he's 19 not a good thing.A guy his age shouldn't be messin with a young girl your age.Not good thing.|`|c92bee50f31327a58e93cbb4ee82b4eeaa	I'm with AinePriestess on this one.  A five year age gap at your age is huge, emotionally and mentally, you're both on a different level.  You've got another three years of high-school ahead of you, whereas he has graduated from high-school and either is hopefully working or is going to college/university.  And like AinePriestess said, because you are a minor, you could run into legal issues later if anything happens.      Though you've 'known' him for 7 months, you've only known him in person for two of those months.  What can be said on the internet can be anything - I've had tons of 'internet crushes' - words on screen don't mean the same as those spoken.  Anyone can spin a tale.  So give it a few months see if the interest remains and if things don't pan out, maybe you'll find someone new to like/love :)     My suggestion: if you're that crazy about each other, then in three years (when you've graduated) see how things are then.
71VRvldJaa	Perhaps if he can't part with the video games, you should part with him!  Successful relationships take a lot of hard work from BOTH people.  It doesn't sound like he's making much of an effort at all.  Video games can be an addiction just like drugs and alcohol.  You're not married yet and look at what your life with him is like already.  These are the "good" days sweety!  Wait till you hit the "bad" ones!|`|jSBtdhf0aa	tell him you are not going to play second fiddle to a video game. my wife told me that about a fishing pole years ago . i didnt go fishing as often because i knew she was right. good luck.|`|517722e044003718f8f92512815e4c2eaa	tell the lazy bum to get off the couch and get a job. thats what cured me:(|`|aI2V5xDGaa	Well obviously he is immature so what you need to do is be thankful you see it now and ask yourself...is this the type of man I wish to marry for life. If so best of luck to you.You may need it...Good luck|`|m13CCGc1aa	If this behavior only started after he was laid off, he may be depressed.  Take him to a psychiatrist.    If this behavior has been an ongoing problem that you have addressed with him many times, then the chances of him changing are limited.  You'll have to decide if you want to stay in the relationship.|`|tManvxfQaa	well its kind of a stress reliever to be honest with you  with all that's going on he is probably taking out allot of frustration out  with it...    So try and be understanding more and know things are hard for a guy..they have to have an out..thank God its video games and not a bar or something really bad....    Just try and be patient and talk to them a little about it...but be understanding...too
Z23xZ7wmaa	...I don't advise you get close to a teacher that you seem to be attracted to regardless of you denying that. It's really not good to want to "get close" to any teacher even if it's just "buddy buddy" because you may enter a grey area.|`|J1J47FIAaa	Thats really creepy.|`|f0wPMwD6aa	I hate the be the one to state the obvious here, but you ARE infatuated and you DO have a crush. You may consider yourself to be rational, but the behaviour and feelings you describe are anything but. DO NOT try to strike up a conversation with this teacher. Keep your feelings to yourself (or if you must, continue to blog here until you get this out of your system), but absolutely do not act on them. Find another target - someone more appropriate (your age range, and not one of the teachers at your school).
FVDTXM68aa	You seem a bit young to be "In Love," but yet love is in the eyes of the beholder  :) From my experience, 13-14 was the time when I found great friendships with guys and really cared about them. I would think, "What if we got married (just typical day dreaming of my Prince Charming)? Oo, I really like him!" But looking back, it was really only infatuation; never love. I had a childhood guy friend who was my "b/f" and our parents thought it would be cute if we grew up and got married. Yeah, the idea was fun, and yes we really cared for each other (nothing serious at this age; innocent, lol), but that was it! We both grew up, I dated and found my true love (now fiance) and he (childhood guy) had a few long term gfs. But back to your question, maybe your feeling a really strong friendship towards him...possibly infatuation? I would say, if your feelings continue later down the road, then maybe they could blossom into love. For me and my childhood friend/bf, we drifted apart. But who knows! I say give it time! Once again, you are the only one who can answer this ;) I know this sounds confusing, but I hope it helps!! lol! Good Luck, hun!! :)|`|oil8ALh4aa	If you were in love you wouldnt question if you were or not|`|8YMkyvhyaa	i am around your age and everybody tells me "your too young to be in love blahh!!!" too.  ok anywayss, it doesnt matter who you are with, or who hes is with, if you truley do believe you love him and hes all you ever think about and you think your heart's in the right place loving or not loving this guy, thats all that matters. all that matters is that youre ok with what your feeling for him.|`|Z23xZ7wmaa	If you were IN LOVE with him, you would KNOW intuitively. Trust me.|`|fXQGUM75aa	Hormones. Trust me, you'll get over it in a month or two. You probably care for him but not "LOVE" him. I think you need to chill and look at other guys. you may think so now,  ut I doubt you'll take a bullet for him in 3 months.|`|97G3OJCOaa	I  don't  think  it's love ,...You  just  have  this  huge  heart  and  need  someone  to  be  around  with  at  all  times  and  care  deeply  about    people  specially  the  ones  around  you.keep  doing  the  time  out  prayer  that  you  have  .You  are  not  in  love  you  care  a  lot.You  have  lots  of  time  ahead  of  you,try not  to  worry  about  love  at  this  time ,keep  making  friends  and  always  keep the  good  ones.  smile and  enjoy  the  life  you  have  .

It's only natural to think of what could have been. Marriage is hard. It's no picnic. It takes a lot of dedication. You do love your husband, it's just that worries and doubts for whatever reason have entered your mind. Maybe you should speak to your husband about what you are worried about. Of course you don't have to tell him about your dreams. Just let him reassure you. Maybe you could go out somewhere nice and discuss it. Good Luck.|`|7975768afc30ab732d41bba7e2ea3a52aa	My I ask why did you get married? I wonder if he is thinking about his exe's too.

You might have polyamorous tendencies.  Perhaps you are simply a bad person.    ...or maybe our memories, including the sexually enthralling ones, belong to us and it is okay to remember them and even allow ourselves to fantasize about them whenever we want.  Perhaps thoughts come, oft times unbidden, into our minds with little to no obvious provocation and it is okay to think about anything your mind chooses to think about.      Despite what some radicals would tell you, thinking something is not equal to DOING something.  If you physically cheat on your husband with another person, you are doing wrong.  If you DREAM about cheating on your husband, even if you FANTASIZE about cheating on your husband, you are not doing wrong.      Your mind, your thoughts are and should be yours and yours alone to do with as you see fit.  You can keep these things to yourself or you can share them, but there is nothing wrong with having them.  If you know that actually doing something would be wrong, then you need only to avoid doing it and you can rest assured that you remain "moral."

jXCjw64Iaa	the way you word your question makes it seem your current boyfriend doesn't mean a lot to you. take a look at him and give yourself an honest answer to this question "am I lucky to be with him? how much does he love me? could this other guy do more things?"    you have to take this seriously and think whether or not you would regret letting your current boyfriend go. you need to decide soon and let your boyfriend know if he is sad. you can't keep him on the ropes, stay with him and recommit or get out. the in between thing is very hard on him.    I hope you make the right choice
dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	He's married?  And you know he's married?  And you still kiss and grope with him?    He's doing it because he can, and everything that's gone on has been "too far".|`|O36qjj7Oaa	He already went to far by kissing and touching you.    Get as far away as you can from this man he is married and just after 1 thing from you.    Edit..Anybody can answer its a free country lol.|`|aqj4E7Aeaa	You're 19.  Probably much hotter and thinner than his wife.  And so far, you haven't said no.|`|96HWpdkFaa	He needs to stop, he's married. Tell him you don't want to see him for awhile because you don't like him hurting his wife. It's not right for you to be apart of that. and most likely nothing good will come of it...his wife and him will probably work things out and then he'll stop coming around.|`|WewCtMpzaa	You're young, and in close proximity to him. Most young girls are pretty sexy to an older guy. He is taking baby steps, and feels like he is getting somewhere, so he is exploiting the situation. We had a family member in our larger family who would do this at family reunions. We had to run him off when he went too far.    He is cheater grade. He will probably always check out what is available. I disagree if you leave him alone, he will shape up. That's naive. If he will check you out, he will check others out as well.|`|nKosOzuVaa	He's coming after you because you're different from his wife & you haven't turned him away. He'll take it sexually as far as he can, but I doubt he's looking to leave his marriage, he just wants to screw you.     If you had a boyfriend who was hugging, kissing and touching another woman, would that be ok with you? If you have a boyfriend is he ok with this guy coming on to you?|`|c785d63ad03bd6785cbde800e0802c7daa	He's using you to escape being emotionally committed to his spouse. You see, if he can get you tied-up emotionally with him for how ever long he wishes to USE (not love) you, that is what he will do because you allow him to. But, when he tires of you, he'll come up with some excuse to drop you and go back to his wife. Men are hunters whether we're married or not. Men are thrill seekers and seek to accomplish another pretty woman as in the teen-age years. So, in short, take a stand and keep your dignity and respect because once it's gone....IT'S GONE.
7foornMVaa	Hey email me, I can help but there is so much to say and cant really do it here.    I have been through this also and Im also from northern cali.      ycreamster2000@yahoo.com|`|B79lX9Inaa	Sorry, just love the kids.  If he is married and no attorney for you, nope the courts will keep them with the father.
AQBi862Jaa	The way I was told about alimony is that if you do not take it the first time you are married and then divorced then you can not get it any other time you get a divorce after that. But if you have any questions, Id seek legal help. A lawyer can help ya. Now if ya dont have a lawyer due to financial issues, you can check out Legal Aide to see if they can help ya. I dont know much about stipulations of alimony as it is.|`|19118ef0907ef0b119cc1faefbfca6f1aa	Don't want your ex wife involved in your personal life than don't ask for alimony.  As long as you remain single you will be able to collect for the number of years ordered by the judge. Once you are married alimony payments stop.  Support yourself.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Alimony is temporary spousal support until they can become self sufficient.  The only "strings" are the ones place upon you by the judget - get working.    I don't think you know anything about alimony.
D3hYbsVJaa	Yes. Usually if you have the means to live overseas, you don't need alimony, and thus the law. Just carry on with your life and deal.|`|e224e1489b387127b36ae2f2d9fcd098aa	If it does not make sense its right, because in all ways yr not living there and yr moving on.    _K_|`|5A7RmIH6aa	you sure cant wait to get married huh.major re-bound.. or hard up.|`|63cd3e2fde966e88768000bacd63dc6faa	Why do you need her to pay you alimony?  You should each just go your separate ways and move on.
WKxnAHpjaa	i had a friend in a similar situation and i told her that she need to report him that no one who loves and care about u would do that so y should she care about him getting what he deserves(going to jail) if u truly love her u should talk to her and tell her to report him/ or if she trust u to tell than that works out to...but either way act fast and smart!!!!!!!|`|oyrIbGwzaa	report that fool, pronto.|`|y66VjrfLaa	good job on keepin a secret...but i guess this is something you should tel someone about...tell the police or report it|`|LIsdyrKYaa	does her mom knows whats going on? if she doesn't she should tell her mom and see what she says. its not healthy that she should be keeping this inside of her. now that shes 18 she should call the cops. and tell them whats going on. because this sounds very gross but what if your girlfriend got pregnant you know so she should get help as soon as she can and if you love her so much you would help her|`|cPfLSeOfaa	talk to her, dont just report it because she might need time to get readyy for that and if u do love her then u might lose her by telling someone|`|oLI2SJ08aa	Tell the police immediately.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	be there for her, when she wants to talk about it, let her. i know as you are her boyfriend your not sure what to do. i'm sure by just being there for her will make things alot better.|`|1KajpBdaaa	go over there and cut his balls off!!!!!! wtf kind of father is he?|`|2imXzBHbaa	you need to make her go to the police and press charges. Since she is 18 now only she can press charges.|`|PakkKi2vaa	report him. what he is doing is wrong.
lIoDmnvEaa	He loves you very much.
JurXNltPaa	Ok I can tell you that it seems as if he sure does like you as well. I think it is actually kinda cute! If you both are shy it is going to take 1 of u to step up and get this poppin. LOL...I say that you need to let him know in more ways that you like him also....For instance walk pass him and give him that sexy eye look, play with him a little, say "hi" in a cute way...See if that helps u get more comfy and if it does then go up to him SOON and tell him that you would like to go out sometimes! All he can say is yes or no but at least you'll feel better after wards. No use in waiting because he could be ur soul mate or someone that you could really make a good match with. Go get em girl!! LOL|`|DKuly5cBaa	go on go|`|4fKk6t6maa	give it some time.   if he likes you enough, he'll get up the nerve and come talk to you.|`|YJDZwIjKaa	it will be really awkward. chances are, he wont talk to you first, so make the first move and talk to him about it|`|aqRVv7Zzaa	just talk to him... because from what you said, it seems like he might be interested in getting to know you a little better.     =)|`|nORUt1qNaa	you should go up to him more since you know he's too shy to go up to you.  :]|`|47Sn5nnxaa	Let him chase you. Guys are totally turned off when the girl makes the first move. I mean, I wouldn't know-being a girl and all, but just take my word for it. I think you should keep flirting and letting him know you are interested and WAIT FOR HIM to come to you! Best of luck!|`|GIXwJWfvaa	aw, well, he obviously likes you.. i know how you feel.  your best bet is if he waits for you to walk with him and  get to know him better. (:  you and a few of your and his  friends could hang out or see a movie or something. you  have to take it gradual..but ignoring him and being shy  around him wont help. (: open up to him and start talking!|`|WAeJabJJaa	get over your shyness. :)  ask if him and his friends want to hang out withyou and your friends someday. then if that goes well you and him can hang out just yall two. some guys like girls making the first moves.     just start a conversation and maybe ask if yall can text.  trust me i was going through the same thing then finally i worked up the nerves to ask if he wanted to ride to the football game with me and my friends and go to ihop with the team afterwards. it went good. :)    if you don't work up the nerves to ask him to hangout you will regret it sooner or later.     good luck hope this helped. :)|`|JW6fHj3zaa	im not sure he likes u but maybe hes just uber scared. try and talk to him about it again....say something like "hey dan, whats up?" or bring up something about homework like "hey dan, do you understand how to do tonights homework?" maybe he'll help u on it then when ur both alone say "dan...um, i was just wondering...u remember what i asked u last week? well, did u have an answer yet?"      simple and plain...not too pushy or anxious. promise me you'll at least try it out..?|`|Cr4lmfIxaa	Approach him once again. When you do, ask him if he would like to hang out with you sometime. He already knows that you like him, so there is no need to rush into a relationship. Just take it slow and see where it takes you. Develop a strong foundation for a friendship before you two officially start dating. Once you two start hanging out more often, things will get a little easier and start to go more smoothly. When you get to know him a little better, it will help determine whether you really want to date him or not. Trust me, it will be well worth it.|`|LoO9LptJaa	this sounds like me and another guy! it's so hard when you're  so shy; but you were brave to tell him that you liked him =]  he definitely likes you back, but i'm also confused about  how two really shy people can move any further! goodluck ?|`|xIF2lShpaa	Just act the the same, and wait to see what happens.|`|3mHQQeLNaa	i no wat dats like :) kinda nerve raking isn't it not knoeing if he likes u back? well mayb u should ask 'Dan' if he likes u back..|`|2HP7IhBqaa	well lol i would wait till he makes a move since he gotta friend close by he's more likely to make a move first :)|`|7sqsVJqGaa	aww, well hes waiting for you because he thinks you're the less shy one. Just go up to him and start a conversation about something-make sure you plan out what you're going to say before doing it. Dont wait too long before he stops waiting for you! If you go and start the conversation then maybe he'll continue talking and make the conversation. I know its times like these that are very awkward. You may be thinking that what i just suggested is impossible, but maybe you can do it when its not that awkward, just act like it was coincidental that you saw him and approached him. Act casual so that he feels comfortable and not awkward. It'll work out. Good luck!|`|Rd3nNYNNaa	Just start a conversation with a 'hi' since thats the only way you can start talking.Be sure to talk to him when his friends are not with him, otherwise both of you will be too shy in front of them.  Trust me, its the only way.Go talk !!!|`|R6tdHob2aa	are u a middle schooler|`|1KVnuc7vaa	he obviously likes you, confront him and ask to hang out!    orrr talk to his friend and ask him whats up(:|`|zrUbBiFdaa	well maybe ask him to go see a movie and then go to the mall or something when your both free. keep it simple at first is the best thing to do.|`|mvaPdekPaa	awww thts so cute! thts usually how i am but apparently ur not THAT shy to tell him how u felt. it seems like he wants to talk to him so one day when hes waiting around come up with a fun topic or bring up a movie or something to get the convo moving. maybe u could exchange phone  s.... good luck!|`|QK3V6AX6aa	ok,   well he obviously likes you too otherwise his friend would not have joked around with him like that.  so good job he likes you too :)  just be bold and talk to him first so he knows for sure that you like him  be assertive and it will all go great!    good luck!|`|eMEgu2eyaa	1. you can do it the little kiddy way and ask his friend to ask him out for you.    2. you can go and make the first move.    3. you can wait until he makes the first move.|`|ZVfxJacvaa	Ask him to hang out? Maybe in a group of friends first if you're really shy, but if you do do that, lmao, I said "do do". Anyways, he may not completely be himself around you. I'd ask him to just hang, or walk you home maybe. An Healready knows how you feel, so just be yourself and go with the flow. Hope I helped. Good lluck
vwoqIUR6aa	ask her about her. don't talk about yourself too much. enjoy the time you are spending with her.|`|z9x5Epzpaa	well you dont have to tell her just do little things to let her know that you really like her. show youre interested. the little things make a big difference. i know it sounds corny but its true|`|COmp4sIuaa	Make sure you two are alone, and say, "I think you're really great, I really like you, and I would like to get to know you better. Do you think we could go out sometime?"     Or something close to that that you feel comfortable with. If you're confident, that becomes very obvious to girls, more than what shirt you're wearing or how you look.

By what I get from that, he sleeps with other girls constantly, even when you two are dating.  He just goes back to you when he can't find any other way to satisfy his needs because he knows you will go back to him.  It's hard to just walk away, but you'll be in a lot less pain in the long run if you do.  It also gives you the opportunity to find someone to date who is REALLY worth all the sorrow, not this pos that cheats on you all the time.|`|I5AxDuOYaa	Tiff, if he has a kid...that is an automatic NO-NO!...i know you love him but trust me..there will be more gusy out there that will come your way and you are gonan look back and say "are you serious....i wante dto be with HIM?"

It's going to be hard to move on, but you should really try to date other guys.  There are a lot of other fish in the sea, and once you move on you will realize he was a complete douchebag.|`|8nexYdUjaa	You know what the right decision for you is: you have to know and understand that you deserve better, someone that will love you and treat you with the same care and respect that you treat them with. a true relationship has to be a two way street, not just one. i think you should let him go, and if you wish you can keep him as a friend, but right now you have to know what's best for you =) i know that you love him, but you really shouldn't give your all and your heart to someone that doesn't seem to make you feel secure, and with no doubts. if you didn't have doubts, you wouldn't be asking this question would you? in the end, this is your decision & maybe it will take you more time to make the right choice, not for anybody else but you ! Take care of yourself, respect yourself enough to know right from wrong. good luck*|`|VbrvE128aa	Ok if u love someone then I know u will do everything in your power to make them feel the same way as u do., And to me there is nothing wrong with that. But there is this old saying that my grandma says "Dont Like Who U Like, Like who likes you". It sounds crazy but while ure sitting there liking someone that doesnt like you back the person that is jus for you and wont cheat and will tell you they love you is right there. I am anything in life worth having is worth waiting for but You have to think to yourself, is this guy worth having or are u in love with him for the right reasons or or you seeing what you wanting to see...Is this the guy you want to marry. If the answer to those questions are yes, then stay but if it isnt you know what you need to do! Gud Luk|`|BiNCwoOiaa	Ok when ebery freakin person on a page tells u the same thing i think it unanimous wat u should do in this case dump him and u guys can still be friends if u care so much about him|`|EQydFhzmaa	Leave him! You are better than that! He doesn't deserve you and you can make yourself a waaaay better life than what he is offering. This isn't love that he is offering you, it is just a waste of your time. If you want what is best for yourself, you will get yourself a new guy - one that is much better than this "love" of yours. You WILL find love again, just don't mistake it with this time.|`|YFLfaeAOaa	If this guy has cheated on you, is this someone that you really think that you can trust? The fact that he hasn't said 'I love you' isn't THAT big of a deal, for there are the types of people that throw it around so easily and some who don't You shouldn't let someone take advantage of you, just because you love them. If you don't want to lose him, then you have to explain to him that he has to earn your trust. Trust isn't something that is just given away, it's something that needs to be earned and deserved.     If he's putting you through so much pain, is it really worth it? Would you want to be with someone that has put you through 2 years of suffering this hurt put upon you?    His problem may be that he is afraid of getting close, causing him to cheat and panic. You need to confront him, and ask him what he expects in your relationship. You can't wait around for him forever because he might lose something very important to him. And he won't this until your out of reach.    This is a decision that you must've been thinking about for a long time if he's cheated more than once. I think you really know the answer to this question, so please, do what's best for your happiness.|`|6FoESYWRaa	Sounds like you already answered your own question or at least have a made up mind. He obviously doesnt love you or care about you, because if he did he wouldn't dog you out and cheat on you with other women. You should have more class and self esteem about yourself to leave him alone and find someone else. If you are letting him run over you he will never respect you and more then likely not want to pursue a serious relationship with you. Men want strong women not weak women who don't care what they do and put up with any and everything. Get rid of him and work on loving yourself and it will be much easier for someone else to. And honestly figure out if you love or lust him. Because how could you possibly love someone who treats you that way. Sex is not everything, go find someone else who will treat you right. Gurl you don't need that drama. Or your other option is to stay there and keep playing the fool until he drives you insane or into some depression state. Life is so much better without the unnessary stress trust me I've been there.|`|DKuly5cBaa	go on go on|`|862d30fa9db31031d62d1012a3f21e6aaa	You need to learn to love yourself. If you did you wouldn't allow this guy to treat you like this, you'd be able to walk away from him and find someone worthy.|`|wqeAeSVYaa	You sound like you have low self esteem.      Wanna date?|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	move on. I mean if you are being with him after he has cheated on you...and "a lot" then you do not care if he cheats on you. and he knows that because you'll take him back with him still cheating on you, it's almost like he thinks it's okay.|`|EFlX4GYOaa	move on and move on fast|`|MQCT1FXjaa	let him the fck go sister.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	Obviously this is a one sided relationship that is only hurting you.  You may think you love him but chances are you are in love with the idea of him more than him.  He may be "the only guy you love" but there are other fish in the sea so to say and you just haven't found the right one yet.  If he can cheat on you with such ease is it really worth it?  As they say, if you love 'em let 'em go.  Believe me this will totally help you in the long run.  But just so you know, it's not totally horrible for him to have a kid, or any other guy you might choose to date, my fiance has a kid with another woman, and we deal with it.  Maybe you should just take some more off time from him and see what your other options are, you never know, you will probably find somebody out there that you matter to instead of somebody who is with you just because they can be.    Don't let yourself get used sweetie, it hurts, hurts a lot, especially when you realize that it doesn't have to be that way.
lIoDmnvEaa	No.  There will be always a lesser or greater person between the two.|`|HcdxxFlZaa	if you already have a boyfriend,whom you love,i doubt you can feel the same way towards another guy.try to figure out your true feelings towards your boyfriend and the other guy.if there is true love,you shouldn't care about another boy,unless you feel the need to be with someone else.in this case,only you can give the right answer to your question.hope this helps.good luck :)|`|mOxVL0luaa	nope. in my opinion there is no second ppl which is the same position, either u loved the the most or second most.
cZNzMyVuaa	Sometimes it really is better to just break up. It sounds like you have problems that have always been there (hence your break-up last year) - if you haven't resolved them yet and she's clearly not willing to put the work in ('I give up', 'this is pointless' etc), you'll probably be much, much happier apart.     Also, I firmly believe that when you are young you should be using your time to find out what traits you really require in a partner, and what traits are the ones to avoid - so that when the time comes for you to settle down into a real adult relationship, you'll know exactly what you do and don't want. Treat this as a good experience, learn and grow from it, and you will probably choose a much more compatible girl for your next partner.
fBdtvrWdaa	hahaha if you dont know what it means don't bother doing it. he wants to put that finger in certain places... If you catch my drift.|`|POBDJUgraa	Him saying he wants to finger you means.. He wants to stick his finger in your "down there" and finger bang it..
nJnKSzmzaa	I would move on ....
0d449c620e934cbe25e669b17809e621aa	ii think you should just make him a little comfortable..because he might be feeling very bad..and if his friends are truthful then you did the right thing but just watch out, if he did it once he might come back again..don't get to soft..just make your limits clear to him..because if it happens again do you think you will forgive him once more? even if he tells the complete truth again? Just think about it, i am sure you are very sweet and many other guys might be better for you because hunny if a guy can do it once he can do it again..don't fall in the trap again make sure his friends are honest and if so..you call him and communicate more, maybe he will be the same faster with your help =]    wish you all the luck sweetie|`|kPEuyjoQaa	cheaters can change...rarely..but do u want that doubt in ur subcontious for however long u guys end up together? ide say its not worth it and that if he really loved u a mistake like that doesnt just happen..ide say find someone new..if his friends love u so much talk to one of them =)
KcUX0WCeaa	i don't think she likes you back.  Sorry.  Either that or she has very very strong values about not dating or chilling with co-workers.  if a girl likes a guy and he asks her out, if she wants to play hard to get she might tell him shes busy one time, but the next time?  She's not interested.  Sorry.
yTB2Zdx6aa	say " sry your a great guy, but i dont think it would work between us, we are to good of friends"|`|qhBf44BJaa	Just be honest. He'll eventually come back around and realize that he can b friends too.|`|FyqCMrCdaa	Tell him you dont want a relationship or anything more than a mutual friendship at this point in your life. :)|`|EVtLlSEwaa	Sometimes it just is what it is. If you have already told him no and he wont drop it then maybe there isn't anything you can do. I had the same thing happen with a guy friend. He would not stop, and when he started trying to get closer by touching me in a romantic way I realized he never would stop. So, I just stopped talking to him altogether. It sucks cuz I liked hanging out with him, but he doesn't push anything anymore...cuz he can't.|`|RfoWhZyFaa	be honest to him tell him that you like him best as a friend and that you like his friendship.
L4uDHUAmaa	Spend more alone time with her. Take her to the movies.
P0gYvapXaa	Stop lying and start telling the truth.  My husband constantly lies to me and we are in the process of getting a divorce even though we just started a family as well.  Be honest about what happened and why you did what you did.  Only by being honest can you get to the root of the problem and begin to re-build things.  It will probably take awhile to rebuild, though.|`|58b05a42d78f0df863773877c01f7007aa	If you are truly ready for change, then take the first step, book a consultation with a good couple councilor and tell her that your are now determent to stop the foolishness and frivolity, and start taking your marriage, family and commitments seriously.   Understand, that there is no quick fix, and it will take time for her to forgive and rebuild your lives together, but  look, you comprehend the severity of the situation and are manning up, so thats a big plus in your favor. Keep it up, and make sure you stay on track.|`|96HWpdkFaa	I'm having trust issues with my husband right now. Just try your best to prove to her that your done with the lies and give her lots of love and attention. If she has big trust issues to begin with like me it may take more time..but just stay strong and say what you mean and mean what you say.|`|3jCNZmv3aa	Once trust is destroyed it is very hard to rebuild. You will have to earn it by proving everyday that you can and will change. There are no easy answers to your question but if she is still with you then at least you have a chance. Talk to a marriage counselor.|`|5jMNBO2naa	why?    why is it that people who do things like they do do not want to accept any responsibility for their actions or outcomes    and that means if she leaves you, then she leaves you, it called action and consequences    if you really screwed up as you say you did, then it will take a very long long long time for her to ever trust you, and even then women are notorious for long memories.. that saying a women forgives but never forgets rings very true|`|61Fwbi79aa	Dude, you are in control of your actions and can make any change that you want, but you have to want it. Dont throw in the towel until you can honestly say that you did everything that you could.|`|LC8iYnncaa	watch the movie fireproof,and do the 40 day love dare. that should help. unless you really screwed up|`|aqj4E7Aeaa	Let's be honest, is she hadn't got knocked up, you'd be gone.  It's ok, in fact it might still be better to leave now than to risk paying alimony AND child support.|`|QRraaOkLaa	So, why do you want her trust?  Have you decided to change?  Are you a compulsive liar?  You will have to give her a strong and very good reason to even want to trust you, and it will take a lot of time to heal the wounds, and one tiny little lie will ruin the whole thing.  You need to think very seriously about this and make a true commitment to changing yourself, and to being very very patient until you prove you can be trusted.|`|EZUYYNGNaa	yes.. be sincere.|`|EzNQp5VYaa	i think their is after all she is your wife she might give you another chance.No more lying if u want to be with her.|`|wE89mPZ3aa	The only way to rebuild the marriage is if both of you want it.  You could get some help from someone who helps couples deal with this kind of problem.  If you are truly sorry and tell her what is in your heart then maybe she will believe you.  She can not just forget it overnight and it will take some time for her to get over it.  Be understanding and know she will have somethings to work through.  Love can overcome alot so hang in there.
cN7eh7Tbaa	OMG you should soo get to know her! start a convo and get her number! i have a feeling this relationship will go farther it will just take some time! dont let your shyness take over you! im sure u r a great person and she would be happy for you two to go out! hope i helped! :)|`|vcWuPlOyaa	Walk up to her and tell her how you feel|`|VtxtY3hXaa	get to know her first and talk with her like say "hi im ___, whats your name?" spark a convo|`|LCIcUTwNaa	So What's your question??Ask her to the dance already.|`|MQCT1FXjaa	ask her,  your not going to get shot in your crotch if she says no|`|YTwnVAtdaa	well there was this kid i liked and i wasnt friends with him but i started talking to him on myspace and he knows who i am now.

Ask her if she would be interested in getting to know you by being your date to the dance. Be a gentleman and look your best!! Best wishes!!|`|5RzhT1Ctaa	I think you should smile, say hi, then talk about something you know about that she might know about. Then if she shows some interest, bring up the dance and then ask her. That sounds so tv but you never know|`|9jWjyKeuaa	That's tough, it's going to be hard to do anything outside of creepy.  Ha the things guys will do for a girl... Anyways your best bet is to try to bump into her somewhere, like the dance you mentioned.  You could try "accidentally" bumping into her, and see what her reaction is.  Depending on how hard you bump into her, it will most likely be a little irritated but you can easily turn that around.  Just start by asking if she's alright, and then ask if there's a way you can make up for it.  Maybe even try pulling the "have I seen you before?" line, corny but it works.      If it doesn't go to well, just let it go.  You can use this the next time you bump into her because now, although maybe not on the best terms, she will at least know your face.    Also maybe try finding her on myspace or facebook, that's a good way to meet random people|`|MtlkMecnaa	just go up and introduce yourself. Ask for her number and then later you can invite her to the dance :)|`|fc671d41cd540ff0aa6b24c9d1f59d48aa	Just go to her say hi and blah, blah and  blah a little bit and ask her out.If things workout go head if not get someone else to the dance.|`|rS7fh6pRaa	Ask her to the dance..

If she says no, ask someone else! Rejection hurts...but if you don't ask her, you might regret it for the rest of your life!! Ask before its too late.|`|FdK1POvmaa	You got to talk to her, The worst thing that can happen is that she rejects you. Life goes on...|`|Ri94QYY0aa	search for her on facebook and get started from there!|`|AA11922229	When you are my age you'll look back and regret not going for it.  It is really lame to ask a date after Tuesday for the weekend.|`|B9dluSbpaa	walk up to her and ask her if she wants to smoke a j|`|M8MlviOFaa	man, being shy thats a tough bump to go over. confidence is they way to go.     play it smooth, somehow strike a conversation with her when you get the opportunity, (a simple hello goes a long way) and ask her if she ever wants to hang out if the conversation goes well. when you guys hang out, thast when i advice you to ask!    cuz it would seem rather weird to me that you ask a complete stranger to a dance, so i say hang out first, then ask, ya dig?|`|7iQ7Kkdjaa	i would consider myself decently experienced in this sort of thing, you dont want to come off too strong, but at the same time you need to get noticed, also i would hold off on telling her you have had a interest in her for some time until you have been together for a few weeks or something at least, when your comfortable. now with all that being said, do exactly this. buy some flowers, if possible meet her somewhere where it wont be weird for you to be, id say school but you mentioned you go to a different school, when you feel your ready to ask her to the dance ( im assuming thats what you want) , go up to her very slowly, and whisper in her ear. "I can has vagina?"|`|ItleV9qeaa	ok buddy u got a short amount of time so heres the plan if u have a friend that knows her get her to introduce u to her tommrow talk to her a solid 30-60 min then leave (say something like i need to help my mom around the house or something) and ask if she wants to continue the convo the next day (btw ask her alot of Q's about her and really listen) if she says shes busy the next day give her ur number (try to get hers to) tell her "well when ever u wanna hang give me a call ur really cool and i liked to get to know u better (than smile and walk away)" if she does call well the rest comes natural remmeber u find friendship before relationship|`|DyUlb5beaa	Buy her a toy|`|LVSKzrHqaa	just go up to her|`|z9x5Epzpaa	just go up to her and start a casual conversation then invite her to go with you to the dance.|`|84f1d633997f832abb6eb96e376f11daaa	ask her to go to the dance|`|rI3R0n7eaa	I'd say go, and just "accidentally" bump into her. Of course, if she spills a drink, not very good, but that usually only happens in movies. If she seems to take interest in you (she checks you out) then, ask her to dance. If she says no, don't take it personally, and just walk away. Good luck!|`|gdiGpGWDaa	I think you already know what to do. ask her to the dance.|`|C4wVB83Raa	ask her and if she doesn't say yes say, well if you don't find a date we can go together|`|S7s9b9Jtaa	you should introduce your self to her at the dance possibly. if you are a shy person this may be a little of a challenge but sinse she has not met you yet then just wing it. if you really wanna get to know her ask her out to dinner or a movie or to the dance. be nice to her and listnen to her and just be yourself and it should all work out. but make sure that she is for sure single before you ask her out|`|yCmgu8ieaa	Where did you see her then???? just start a conversation with her when you see her again... find some way to see her all the time and eventually ask her if shes single and if she wants to go with you. just randomly asking her will freak her out and she'll think that she doesn't know you so why the hell would she go somewhere with you
L4uDHUAmaa	Well do you think about him all the time??? Do you want to see him when he's not there by your side??? Are you happy when he is with you??? If YES well then you are in LOVE|`|lVNYRSs8aa	it could be love    but the only way to know is if you ask yourself this    "If he left your life, how would you feel?"    if it would be mostly negative, then your answer is obvious

53aUYsqtaa	One of the most confusing and puzzling question can be trying to figure out does he like me or not. Most guys tend to send out mixed signals which often makes it really confusing for most girls to figure out whether he likes them or not. You can never be hundred percent sure about whether he likes you or not yet there are certain ways to figure out what he is actually looking for. Read on to discover some of the proven ways to figure out whether he likes you or not.    He would smile at you a lot- When a guy likes you he would tend to smile more than usual when he is looking at you. You can always make out from a guys smile whether he likes you or not just based on the way he smiles. If he passes an invitational smile towards you as if he is willing to have a word than he definitely likes you.    Finds a reason to have a word with you- If a guy likes you than he would find all possible reasons to get in conversation with you and would be willing to get your attention as much as possible. The best way to guess whether he likes you or not is to simply read between his lines. When a guy normally tends to like a girl he would always give small hints within the conversation that he fancies you and would love to go out with you.    Catch his stare- This is probably one of the best ways to figure out whether a guy likes you or not. If he likes you than he would stare at you in a different manner different from how he looks at other people.    He keeps looking- If a guy likes you than he would keep looking towards you even after you have had a word with him. For example he would always keep looking at you even if you pass by him. The best way to find out whether he is looking or not is to simply turn your head around and catch his stare.    Constantly tries to impress you- When a guy tries to impress girl than he definitely likes her. If he is always dressed well around you and tries to present himself in the best of his behavior than he is definitely likes you and is waiting for an indication or signal from your side.      He blushes and sweats. You intimidate him.    He stares at you. (He can be a stalker, beware)    He does things to deliberately gain your attention.    He stutters when he speaks to you.    His pupils dilate when you are up close and you see them... Beware, pupils dilate when it is dim, mostly.    He waits for you. He looks out for you.    He laughs at your jokes when no one else does.    He teases you because he wants you to remember and notice him.    He listens to you and actually remembers little details.    He notices slight changes in your appearance.    He seems sad when you ignore him.    He seems jealous when you are with another guy. Whoo.    His friends all know you when you don't know them.    He smiles back when you smile at him.    He often stares at you and when you catch him, he does that cute head turn, very fast!    He performs sweet acts for you. He defends and protects you. He tolerates you being mean to him.    Signs that he is a player    He is a smooth talker. He is very comfortable around you.    He places his hands on you with ease.    Every other girl likes him.    Just be careful.

So, try to be straightforward with HIM.  Take the initiative to say something to him first, flirt a little, maybe hang out, see what happens!

AwVDIKrEaa	hahah, just try to get away  like fake a yawn and pretend you're tired. or tell them you need to go back somewhere cause you left something behind. or just say you need to use a restroom.  if you want to keep talking, just wait until they stop to catch their breath. this is your chance to jump in|`|0er0K2IJaa	There are some individuals who think a conversation is listening to them forever making it impossible to hold a two way conversation.

Trust me, it might take a little work but when a girl is comfortable she'll do anything...|`|w1RPYXoiaa	Touch her hand lightly while you're talking. Don't be too obvious about showing that you know what you are doing.  That might break the ice.|`|hIAKXlsNaa	Maybe you could get up and go get something real quick, then when you come back you could sit on the other side of her where her purse isn't at.  Or "accidentally" bump it to the floor and slide over alil closer when you bend to pick it up for her.  Good Luck :^)|`|EwEYlNBsaa	stop being a *****, move it, and skoot closer, then l8r on you pork that lil ho|`|0iGPAUBCaa	If you can make a girl laugh, you can make her do anything...unless she thinks what you want to do is wrong. But if she put her purse there, it means that you're making her uncomfortable. Back off until she trusts you a little more.|`|NENNHNVPaa	The purse is her way of saying :    "I don't mind talking to you, but I'm not sure I want you to get close yet."      Give her more time.  She will move the purse when she is ready.  You are just going to have to take your time.  Keep talking to her.  Maybe ask her out with a group of friends for a group movie or coffee meet.|`|8ZoSSslFaa	Get in line after her and let her sit down first. then site on the side that her purse is not on :)|`|UEgqI1Euaa	Maybe try sitting next to her instead of across from her, or walk her to her next class, show up at her locker to say good morning or hi...  Good luck!!|`|58b05a42d78f0df863773877c01f7007aa	You have to consider the fact that she might not be that into you, or she is not interested in anything more then friendship. If this is not the case, and you think there might be a chance for future relationships, and then just give her time, dont behave desperate or like a creep who is trying to get in her pants. Be respectful, and be a bit aloof as well. Girls, for the most part are not that keen on someone who looks overly eager. James Bond your game, be a little mysterious, not so available, and once in a while flirt harmlessly with other girls. If she still appeared unmoved, then you are stuck in the friend zone, so time to look elsewhere for someone who wants to be with you on a girlfriend level.|`|VtxtY3hXaa	certainly dont force her. if she doesnt like you than leave her alone but if she might than here are tips;     1. dont be stupid and make dumb jokes   2. dont be gross like picking your nose   3. be sensative    4. be kind but dont treat her special   5. respect her|`|xgui1LAFaa	its almost like the bag represents a boundary of her space.. so id wait until the bag goes, then go for it.|`|wysPLMBnaa	when shes not looking pull a fast one and move the purse and slide your way into that vag buddy  =]]|`|4gMmrz9maa	Simply say that you reallly like her bag and ask to see it, once your finished move it somewhere else.(:|`|gUy60Efhaa	In a joking, cute way, be like, 'you have a nice purse, by the way... oh, but can you just move it aside, it feels like the Berlin wall between us!  hahaha! (or say something to that effect.)   OR, better yet, you could be like (joking ...)  say ' hey, can u just do me a favor and move your purse on the other side of you so that when u are not looking I can sneak some of the food off your lunchplate?! haha!'   If she is clever, she'll get it.  If she doesn't move the purse, sit on the other side of her!|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	Compliment her|`|YzhYFu0eaa	Rather than getting closer to her, you should tell her how you feel.  She may have it there because she isn't sure how you feel about her, and would feel awkward if you suddenly made a move on her.|`|578e2f7a3fd2ad02982eaa05fbce0dc4aa	Take her to a evening dine. And talk with her in poetic manner. thats all|`|4XCg1mIMaa	Maybe she uses the bag to have her space, I wouldn't invade it.....she may move it when she feels comfortable and right now she can probably tell you want it moved.....just leave it alone..|`|WP5dSiCmaa	Tell her she really looks hot in that sweater. For Valentine's Day, by her some lingerie. She'll TOTALLY dig it...      edit: 'lovegasm' above hit the nail on the head. A senior in high school asking this question? Wow, become a monk immediately.|`|loDpgmSvaa	Ok, the purse that is between you didn't mean that she dosnt like you. It just means she's not comftorable. The big thing that you need to rembrr is that you can't rush love. But just ask her if she would move it or when she's not looking kindly set it on the ground. Or you can just talk to her about it. Best of luck to you.|`|ySB6dZYlaa	Well I'm glad the purse is hers. Kidding  Are you sure that's shes into you? Women know right off that bat most times if they are going to let things go further. Open up a little more to her to find out if you're wasting your time.
Pluczqoqaa	He starts a fight and you're afraid he's going to sue you because he got the worst of it?  That's a sad sign of the times.  If I were a judge I'd laugh him right out of the courtroom.    BTW, Stallion, you're just too cool.  Get over yourself.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	Hopefully he does. You cannot tell me you didn't know how hard you were being. This is so not acceptable and should never have gone that far. You need to take responsibility!|`|BbjELH60aa	Uhmm  Yeah he probably could, i mean there's a possibility that he won't be able to because it was self defense, but since it was just the two of you, most of the time they see it as, well you could've just walked away from it you know? but if this guy was just not leaving you alone, then it's total self defense and he couldn't sue you.
HlRWA3JHaa	1- never reply her txt messages  2-don't pick up her call  3-be extremly blunt with her and cancel any invites given to you by her.|`|a1ymHaWAaa	just ignore her text or keep blowing her off|`|5eb82f15d183d6d66fa6225d22e2faabaa	just ignore the texts.  Hopefully she will get the hint. If not, then tell her in a kind way (please) that you are not interested in her. Don't lie and tell her you have a gf, or other nonsense, just be truthful in a gentle way.|`|AA10791200	keep ignoring her|`|JGeglWJ9aa	u just have to be honest...just say, i was wonderin if we could stop txtin for now. hopefully she'll understand|`|snbMl6kfaa	you idiot! your going to break her heart!! talk to her and give her a chance! how is that so hard? you know she could be the best girl ever but you just dont know it yet!|`|JZkCVHJAaa	three words i-am-gay, you could ignore her or just flat out tell her please stop texting me im not interested|`|FpcKeNKLaa	tell her to leave you alone. it's that simple|`|IyvVPKqcaa	do alot of annowing things and do things you know she doesn't like and make yourself seem boring and annoying garanteed to work! im a girl i should know a guy who is cocky and rude is a totall turn off
oKRbe6XYaa	Hmm, u should start talkin bout hot guys & see how he would react!(*_*)|`|2FhPfxnsaa	I'm not sure if you watch "The Hills", but this is the "Justin Bobby" method. It's just a tactic to let him be the controlling one in the relationship. And with guys, let him. The ideal situation in a relationship is for the guy to think he's in control but the girl actually is.|`|rtJTl01oaa	Next time he does it ask him face to face "When you talk about how hot girls are, do you think it makes me like you more?"    He should realize he is close to being dumped and clean up his act. If he doesn't change his attitude, are you willing to put up with this for the next few months? Years?|`|W05lqxGHaa	i think he likes other girl OR  he's a gay ..that's the two major reasons why he keeps on talking about other girls|`|TXCoUGgpaa	Mmmm....You sit that boy down and you tell him what's what. Smack him in the face if he gets lippy. Lmao. No...I would just talk to him about it. It really isn't acceptable behavior, and you can tell him that if you don't get better from him, he can go find someone else. You are worth more than that.|`|ba0d5ff814e4de743ed883cab2a57206aa	He is rude.  If he is trying to be in control, then tell him that maybe he should be with her instead of you and walk away.  Do not let him be in control ever. It is a two way street and not just one person should control the other. No matter how much you like them or how much fun they are at other times.  Continue to tell him to be with her and walk away from him until he either stops or takes your advise.|`|f25peTSXaa	dont act threatened  just say     "babe im not one of the guys, remember"    and smile sweetly like it doesnt bother you    hes trying to get a reaction from you  guys push their girlfriends buttons sometimes just to get a reaction    he probably doesnt even think those girls are that hot|`|O1lm79EFaa	He sounds  immature and maybe even insecure...  I would give him a taste of his own medicine... start talking about how hot some guys are.  Maybe he'll clue in and grow up. if not kick his lame a$$ to the curb he sounds superficial|`|ZnJ2Y5cAaa	Hes doing it way to much i would never talk about other girls in front of a girl just as i woudnt a girl to talk about how hot other guys are when shes around me thats something guys talk to guys about he needs to figure that out you should tell him to stop|`|mvaPdekPaa	ooooh... tht sucks tht hes one of those guys. just ask him why he brings it up and is he trying to hint around something?!? i mean dont get real into it bc u wouldnt want to end the relationship over it.... or u might.|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	sure its rude and he might be telling you he's not that interested.  tell him to his face it bothers you and he'll either say he's sorry or he'll be a jerk in which case you can drop him.  Tell him you're a lady not one of the guys.|`|lbMUNNCuaa	Awhhh you guys are so young and nervous! He probably has no real clue how to talk to a girl...this sounds like something he'd talk about with the guys. Try to steer the conversation, tell him sweetly how silly he's being talking about other hot girls when he's got a hottie right in front of him. Betcha he'll blush! Kindly mention how you don't think he'd like you talking about other guys. Set a ground rule. That's so important if a relationship is going to last. Mutual respect, understanding each others boundaries.   Good luck and have fun, don't take things too seriously. Enjoy the moment =)|`|gi6XkTTraa	tell him exactly what you told us, that you wouldn't mind if it was once in a while and that it's making you uncomfortable. I personally think he's overdoing it.|`|B7idbFNVaa	No. You are not overreacting.  A guy talking about 'how hot" other girls while his girlfriend next to him is DISRESPECTFUL.  His focus and attention should ONLY be of his girlfriend.  He can looks at other girls but to talk about them in front of your face is WRONG.    This is what he MIGHT think you in.  1. you might not be good enough  2. this is just a short-term relationship  3. I wish you have the same quality that this "hot girls"|`|EjhBMKX8aa	rude tell him to stop and if he dont than do the same to him and see if he likes it.|`|13f8355359652cfde88b26bd8b3d6c6caa	Start talking about hot guys!  All of them.|`|XSoAZD82aa	the way my relationship is; and im 18, i can say wow that girls hot and my g/f can say wow that guys hot but we know that we arn't just going to run off with a person just cause they're hot. it's just a great relationship that we have together and if u both can be like that then u will last for a while. u should try saying wow that guys hot and see what he says. if he says nothing than he understands that ur not just gonna run off with that guy lol. if he does say something then he is jelous and doesnt like it then that is the time u can say "hey    u say that girls are hot all the time to me so i dont wanna hear it lol or somthing like that hope it helps. oh..... and when and if u guys have sex and u still say things like wow s/he is hot. trust me it wont bother u because sex changes the relationship completely and it takes a whole new tole on u guys. good luck|`|OapbXepjaa	He is being totally rude and his actions are disrespectable and uncalled for.    This happened personally with my boyfriend of 2 years now when we had been dating for 6 months he told me he thought this girl who was a friend was cute.    I said you know if you think other girls are cute why am I wasting my time with you and starting grabbing my stuff because I was going to leave him. He must've realized how wrong it was because he started getting upset and telling me is this it and are we done? and I said if you think other girls are cute and tell me that I'm done here thanks and he apologized and told me not to leave, it has never happened again and 1 year and a half later we are super happy.    ** In your situation if you really like the guy you can take 1 of 2 approaches. Start saying things when you're out like wow look how hot that guys body is or that guy had gorgeous eyes, payback is a ****** as they say and he will soon realize how he's making you feel.     2 is talking to him about it. Next time he does that say you sound like a dog when you grovel over every girl that walks by are you that desperate? or you could say that makes me feel unappreciated and I deserve better than that.    Hope this helps :)
adRhKB05aa	Yes.  It will pass.|`|9Z48RhlKaa	Yeah.  When I was like 12 or 13    I delt with it and talked to people, Though it is 5 years later...
3892ff0d005ca0e7cc3e0bb1045ba012aa	Nothing. My ex husband and I share custody of our children 50/50. We provide what we need for them at our own houses and share other things like coats, shoes, etc. Any expenses for our kids that come out of our pockets for school, activities, etc get split 50/50 also.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	An amount that we agreed on that meets the financial needs of our son.  Both my ex husband and I contribute the same amount.     Sorry. I'm not prepared to share it on a public forum.|`|5ILdSx7faa	Nothing I had sperm donors for fathers.  I have raised 4 children without support.|`|58b05a42d78f0df863773877c01f7007aa	There are no fixed formals, and it depends on your husbands earnings, your earnings, general lifestyle when you were married, and how long were you together basically, you need a good lawyer who will take the matter to family court and make sure you get what you can for you and your child. If you have sole custody, versus joined custody, that is also a factor. You cannot get the most of it if you dont have an attorney working for you, unless you and your ex can peaceably agree and you are happy with your arrangements. But you must understand, that Unless a judgement is issued, there are not guarantees that he wont take off and since there is no judgement in place you will have to chase him and start all over.|`|EvzEjuOGaa	Zilch, even though I have 3 kids with him|`|fGE7hL12aa	My daughter gets $47.00 per week.|`|rH33ty23aa	When my ex had a job he was paying $454 a month. But hes been outta a job for about 9 months, so its all adding up. We have 1 child|`|9MsJHrz3aa	I'm lucky if i get 150.00 dollars a month for my 3 kids sometimes not even that.
HlRWA3JHaa	do not say you are sorry and don't call nor txt,you ignoring him will make him chase you and when he does be pretty straight up and don't seem too excited or else it might scare him again.we re ladies and we have our stand.|`|eoov5TzUaa	if you went about asking him in an inappropriate way then yes apologize for asking so rudely and explain you shoulda done it differently, but other then that no really reason to apologize you were and still are concerned about your relationship and thats ok. As for him asking for time, it sounds like he is confused about what he should do. but it definitley sounds like he really likes or loves you if he thinks about it.. unfortuantly he may like her, but it's because they have a past, and maybe she was his best friend, doesn't always mean he wants to be with her at all, he may be confusing the feelings, but i don't think you should worry at all. He will call you back and i'm sure he will explain everything to you! =)
JHdFwKY4aa	It is not weird at all.  Don't worry.  Everyone goes through relationships at their own paces.  You can kiss tomorrow or next month, but the first kiss is always fun.  Even if you mess up, if you have fun about it then it will turn out fine.  Like when you are later on in your relationship you can go, "Remember when I kissed your eye the first time we were going to kiss?"  And you guys might just laugh.|`|g6tku4aVaa	do it..for a fact i know he'll like it..that's normal for many people..  if ur willing to give up ur first kiss to him..then do it|`|AA12294389	its normal, whats the brand of your toothpaste? just kidding, to kiss or not to kiss is normal at your age, but there will come a time where both of you will feel the urge to make physical contact like kissing and its normal, well you know what is right or wrong both of you can set up limitations.|`|pqOLekE7aa	Eh, i haven't had my first kiss yet so i can't really say much...but all i can say is.. don't do something because everyone is telling you to or bugging you to do it. I did that and it just messed things up for me. Do what you feel is right and are comfortable with! Hope it all works out for the best for you guys!!|`|0V2UrTqoaa	no it's not THAT weird you've only been together for 3 months, if you really want to kiss him just go for it|`|ZFBL9D1aaa	Your boyfriend has to be the one to buck up and kiss you.  He probably really, really wants to, but is just nervous about messing up.  So don't worry, and don't ask him if he's ever going to kiss you.  That happened with me a long time ago. :]|`|YK5y5m51aa	Don't do stuff simply because people are pressuring to. Just do what u are comfortable with|`|IyvVPKqcaa	well just ask yourself wut kind of a relationship it is sure you love seing each other but you  love seing your friends too right? so if you think its a for sure love relationship then maybe try and make a move if it still doesn't work then talk to him about it and if he says he's not ready give it somtime but while waiting slowly and gradually try and lay your moves on him. just don't let it bother you too much it doesn't mean he doesn't like you.|`|duCCmCMxaa	no its not really that weird it just means that right special moment just hasnt come.  but dont worry cause it will come around  you just have to be patient  and dont think he doesnt like you because yall dont kiss  maybe hes scared because your his first girlfriend and he probaly really likes you and is afraid to mess anything up with you|`|SBoPBsoOaa	I was eighteen before I felt comfortable enough to kiss. And I had previously dated a guy for four years! It's different for people. You may not want to wait as long as I did, but you're just fine. ;)|`|7cc79a266014247b9d92e937afa5e984aa	I think thats sweet. My boyfriend (soon to be X) kissed me the hour he asked me out. I regret it a lot! He was also my first kiss and we are both 15. I'm dumping him tomorrow because hes a jerk to me and says he doesn't deserve him. ugh I hope ya'll aint like us. Goodluck girl =)    And to answer your question lol I think it's fine. Just wait when your ready and if you are and he doesn't make a move. Just pop him a kiss!|`|rqxLVwHlaa	the sam thing happened to me all my friends got dates and they wer kissing within the first week but with my gf i waited she wasnt ready and  really neither was i so just cool ur jets... and dont get to clingy bad! and there is nothing rong with asking if they want to kiss u. it does dappen the mood but atleast u no|`|vkJ3tEjbaa	I think its quite sweet :) Its cool that you guys can still be close without having a physical relationship kind of thing. That's something alot of people don't have. I think this would make your first kiss really special considering how long you have been dating for!    Best of luck to you guys!|`|8nexYdUjaa	That's a really good thing, don't worry !  it just means that the right time has not come yet,  and when you both are ready and the right time does come  it will be that much more special because you waited =)  don't worry, just let everything happen naturally.  Good luck, i hope i helped !|`|lyT18G3yaa	I think it is okay... Wait till you are both ready so you do not screw things up|`|0noPBUYXaa	do what you think is best.. if you dont kiss him and wait, later on when you do, it will be all the more special. you can always give someone a kiss but only once can you share a first kiss. make it special girl =]
yTB2Zdx6aa	umm cute and hot are two whole different subjects, he might think you are hot too, they arent just different levels of good looking|`|EX1GjjJCaa	Exactly what legend said.|`|COmp4sIuaa	To me, here's the difference:    Hot - I'd tap that    Cute - She's adorable. I could love her.    That's how it is for me.|`|MQCT1FXjaa	probably attractive|`|0NQL7yRPaa	what ..legend ..said|`|ZFBL9D1aaa	THIS IS COMING FROM A GUY:  When we say cute, we think you're really attractive.  But guys, if they care, don't say "hott," we usually say cute and beautiful.|`|EghHVkHEaa	Well it might mean different things to different guys, cute is better than ugly tho right? lol.|`|1QLp7iC5aa	"cute" means he is interested in you and didnt want to degrade you by calling you "hott" to your best friend. He was probably playing it safe. He digs you, dont worry!|`|BQHxmm9qaa	cute means he likes the way you look, but he doesnt want to make it seem likes hes really hung up on you. he wouldnt say it if he wasnt into you, he thinks your hot. CONGRATS!|`|BiNCwoOiaa	i only have three words ro say to u GET A LIFE|`|bG8mEUHhaa	ur nt dat hot to him...|`|SBoPBsoOaa	Cute can mean your personality as well. In fact I'd say that's probably what people are referring to more than anything. But you really shouldn't be obsessing over something like this... lol|`|yrtlMEKgaa	"yeah shes really chill, easy to talk to and pretty cute" is EXACTLY WHAT HE MEANT. That's how guys are.|`|153eMQmnaa	lol if he's like me then hmm me personally never say cute only beautiful,cute,gorgeous, and magnificent. they are more romantic and thats how u tell who i like i say hot then..not intrested on think u look good i say any of the 4 words i listed then ya i like you and so he's probably like me i like a girl for her personality not only her looks their is a limit to how ugly but if he's like me then cute would be another word for beautiful :) hope this helps|`|zMDkllJvaa	cute means you dont look like a whore your pretty but not slutty looking innocent lol
lK6S5cGSaa	Get him an xbox, it won't go to waste and he will love you forever.|`|E7zBUp3Kaa	I think that is a cute idea! Good luck!|`|Uc1HPeFZaa	Sounds awesome!
cWy17SRnaa	She is not a true friend.  She wants what you have.  You should not even try to apologize. You did nothing wrong.  She should get over it.  When she had a boyfriend, that is all she talked about and now that you have one, she can't stand it.  You just need to cut all contact with her.  You will find a new friend, one that is true and that listens to you.  Good luck.
VSCYTZ38aa	Probably. Your fiance might kill you though.|`|tBODwcqXaa	You poor thing! They should get mailed. I'll pray for ya!|`|di6p10Ifaa	I would imagine they will come back to your house. The post office is picky.|`|E7zBUp3Kaa	Yes. My dad works for the post office and has seen this happen before. A friend of my also often forgets what side of the envelope the stamps go on and I get letters in my mailbox that have uncanceled stamps on them. Don't worry, as long as they are stamped you are gold.    Good luck in your marriage!|`|gQYtRcrbaa	giggles...yes but the post office will be pissed because they have to be handled instead of going through the machine|`|f9089da3646d378f6e78bf639f6a51c3aa	YES..as long as they are the correct postage it will be fine...BUT the recipients will probably find it funny..LOL|`|FbJ5samUaa	Yes, but it may slow down processing a bit.|`|d3icrU62aa	haha you'll be allright buddy|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	Take them to the post office, let the clerk know what you did, and have him or her hand cancel them.  They'll do it for you.|`|oAPSJnSEaa	See this is why you don't let men do things un supervised.
aBv4zph1aa	Determine how many adults are in your party, and how many within that group are drinkers. Assuming you'll also have soft drinks too?       Now re:   WINE:  You get about 4 drinks out of one 750 ml. bottle of wine.   Or, figure one to two bottles of wine per table of 8.     CHAMPAGNE (For toasting):  You can get serve about 6-8 small glasses for the toasting  out of one 750 ml. bottle.    BEER:  Estimate up 2-3 bottles of beer for each person (again, you're not going to include every guest; just a general  percentage of ppl in your reception that are drinkers.....you'll be safe if you estimate 40-50% of your adult guests).    Another consideration.  If you're having food professionally catered, ask them.  They can give you a pretty good estimate.    Note:  You don't want anyone in your party to become too intoxicated (too many liability issues).  You'd want just enough for your guests to enjoy the occasion.|`|ccbe102f74b6b3b7bc011011a98bdaf8aa	Well for one I would say you can save a lot of money and buy kegs rather than cases of beer for the amount that you are talking about if it is possible, that way it can also be poured into glasses and looks a bit better than cans all over the place. For a number I would say 2 kegs as plenty, one would suffice. One keg equals roughly 168 cans of beer so if you are talking cases one keg equals 7 24 packs. As for wine if all 130 guests are adults I would say 2 cases of each red & white, if that includes children or you know they are lighter drinkers than one should be fine.|`|SN4vRAnuaa	i wouuld say 2 per person, because there is always going to be the people that wanna drink more, and those who will not wanna drink anything.    I would by one of them little tanks tho!!!! it would save you some bucks!!!|`|yUnQahGoaa	First you have to figure out how many people are actually going to drink. Then you have to figure out how much these people usually drink. Are they going to just face a few or are they planning on getting completely wasted? I would probably purchase as a rough estimate of at least 80 cases if not more. That would be what like 7 a piece? And I'm not sure about the wine.|`|AA11737190	I don't know, but these people do: http://wedding.theknot.com/wedding-plann...|`|15a395b81e70741dfdfed45167d39207aa	Bottles are tacky for a wedding get a keg. If you run out you run out but the odds are against running. So now you and new old lady can have a few by yourselfs.|`|jZ03Zdjdaa	Are you having the wedding professionally catered?  Ask the caterer.  They have mathematical formulas for how much beer and wine to buy.  Also, there are formulas for this on the internet.  You might also want to have champagne.    FWIW, I think that 4 beers per adult is high.  I would guess 2, and remember not everyone drinks beer.|`|lMT8btn8aa	I'm guessing that everyone would drinks 4 beers (some will drink less, some more). That means that you need 17 cases. I'd provide 20 to have a nice round number.|`|tBODwcqXaa	At least one drink per hour per of-age guest.|`|m13CCGc1aa	It depends on how heavy of drinkers your family and friends are.  If they are relatively light drinkers, I would suggest 4 beers per person (which would equal a beer for each hour.)    If they are heavy drinkers, then it is anybody's guess how much beer you could need....    If they are light drinkers, I would get 24 bottles of wine.  If they are heavy drinkers, I would just buy beer.
a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	Tall.|`|ZiHcxJv7aa	Tall guys for sure, the seem more masculine in some way and you just like feel protected hehe. i Think 5.9 is the shortest i would go with i guy (my husband is 6.0), cuz i am 5.8.|`|UCKAiLN1aa	Tall men. :)|`|1dVoVp1gaa	tall|`|nZ7pGQfFaa	I like them taller. I am 5ft, so I definitely don't want someone shorter.  ha ha..|`|4jx4wAhgaa	If you are a tall person, you will say a tall guy is hotter because he's the right height for you but if you are a short person, you will say a short guy is hotter!|`|cAPf4kdIaa	it depends short and skinny yes short and fat yes tall and fat or skinny eather way it depends on the personality|`|qcB23QvZaa	TAll guys! for sure    because if the guy is shorter then you, you sort of feel more manly yourself    idk thats just my personal take on it|`|euOtDB3Baa	Ooooooo!  Tall guys! Even though I'm not very tall, definitely tall guys are hotter.  I love how their long arms go all the way around your waist  and then some when they hold you.  That can really get my heart pounding, depending on the guy!  But there are always exceptions to the rule...so short isn't all that bad either, guys.|`|5b3CJ0dBaa	tall generally, but it depends on the person|`|2ef1a93af7fa078891b52864f5e35b31aa	Taller than me is fine, which isn't hard to achieve since I'm pretty short. :]
vZ5EbvtJaa	the extra money is not a reason to get married but love is. i still think you should wait until he gets back tho. you've only been together for a yr. but if you really do know in your heart that he's the one for you it really doesn't matter what others think. it would be nice to have your parents blessing but you ARE 19 which makes you legal. if this is really what you want to do just sit down with them like an adult and discuss the situation. tell them how you really feel and hopefully they'll understand :)|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	You're 19. That makes you a legal adult.  Your parents don't have the authority to allow or not allow you to do anything.|`|O36qjj7Oaa	Your 19 and dont need your parents permission to get married.    Just tell them that your getting married and if they have a problem with it thats their problem not yours.|`|N9o2ZEtXaa	We want to get married when he comes to visit in the summer because he would get extra pay and we would be doing awesome financially. 
nCWjdyddaa	In my opinion, this action will only elicit an angry response. Why? Because it's not about bending the will of the child to obedience; it's about revenge. It's passive-aggressive behavior and has no place in dealing with a child.    When a child is purposefully disobedient, the reaction should be swift and predictable. You should have a plan set up ahead of time for any behavior which comes under this heading. For instance, if the child says no (make sure the request is reasonable), he loses a possession of the parent's choice for a week. Ask again. If he says no, another possession leaves . . . and so on. Any possession or privilege other than the basics (a few sets of clothing, a bed, etc) is fair game.    No need necessarily to use this particular method. But, whatever you use, it should be set up ahead of time so the child knows what to expect. And it should be carried out WITHOUT EXCEPTION. If you back down or mediate it, it's over.    Good luck to you.|`|fAN2DQJyaa	I don't think it's okay. Firstly, it's really annoying. Don't your clothes get all wet and stuff? I would really hate that. I agree that this is a way to handle an animal. But truthfully, even to animals it's pretty mean and unpractical. Your ex should grow up and look for better ways to handle your 13 year old.    Secondly, you're teaching your child that it's okay to use force and violence to resolve problems instead of talking it out or resolving. Although it may not hurt physically it could hurt mentally.|`|92fbce946753f473dafcf78d171f5a2baa	no! thats what you do to cats when they wont get off the counter!|`|E1qJY3Zcaa	Thats what you do when two dogs are hooked up,is your ex an idiot??
IPlvWyDFaa	How many times are you going to be last choice for her before you have enough? You are aware that she only comes to you when everyone else falls away and still you wonder if you should take her back as a friend? She is not a friend to you - a friend would never treat you as she does. A friend would not hurt you deliberately. A friend is someone you can count on. How can you count on her when you will never know when she is going to drop you again in favor of someone else?|`|vKrWrhQeaa	it's ok :)    well if it was me, i wouldn't really wanna be her friend  just because this is proof that she isn't a true friend...the only reason she wants to be friends again is because she got dumped by her old ones....it'll keep going like a cycle if it doesn't stop, and pretty soon you'll be the person she bugs late at night and what not|`|TJiGs8S4aa	No, why would you waste the time on her?  She's shown you multiple times that she is a user of people, and not a real friend.  I wouldn't bother talking to her.|`|7373301fb91991a1469991a708c2565caa	Is she a true friend, or someone that has been using you?     You know the answer to that in your heart.     Proceed accordingly.       .|`|bG8mEUHhaa	no,dnt worry bout her anymore unless u r gonna consider her as an acquaintance|`|yCmgu8ieaa	tell her to **** off for good. she doesn't value your friendship, never has, never will|`|ZW1xklaAaa	keep her out of your life she is a user and couldnt care a bit about you surround yourself with people who are there for you no time in life for that kind of people|`|5PBfj1EEaa	i wouldn't keep forgiving her over and over. you've given her a chance. maybe one more chance wouldnt hurt but she needs to know that everytime someone new comes to hang out or someone she used to be friends with is looking for her its not cool to just run off and act like u're nobody. i would say give her that chance to talk and let her know what she is doing wrong and if she messes up again than thats it. everyone deserves the chance to fix a mistake. 1st time mistake thats on you, 2nd time is stupidity and thats on her. hope that helps a lil
PK0doXNiaa	oh my god i almost crapped my pants looking at it no way lol|`|znT5ApQeaa	in dent all paragragh  and are u finish. good assay|`|gUy60Efhaa	It is well written, you did a great job, really.  However, indent the first sentence of your paragraphs...  (like 2 spaces before you type the first word of each paragraph.  Try being a little more creative with the conclusion, last 3 -5 sentences of the end paragraph at the end of the essay (conclusion.)  Anyways, gold star for you!  It seems like you put a lot of thought into this.  Good!!!|`|DkP14oJaaa	helllllllllllllllllz nah|`|AJ38Xqyeaa	fix da whole thang
Z4PxfObXaa	Maybe her phone is screwed up.  Try texting her.|`|bNhyEJHsaa	maybe she got a new number.... maybe she is mad at you for some random reason, and blocked your number from calling her..... Or maybe she hasnt payed her bill. there are alot of things that could have happenedd.|`|Q79IWCBxaa	That's funny... When I call her she answers everytime. hmmm...|`|wjz3RUTAaa	The line isnt activated|`|AA11922229	Borrow a friends phone and call her.  Dude,.....  she's putting you on ignore.|`|HAiGuKIeaa	May be there is some problem with her phone try text the sms  or email her..If not try to reach some of her friends and know the reason.    If not go and meet her personally if she stays near.|`|9e4f17e04f6a518df825311a06f819d2aa	Her phone is out of order or out of minutes.

Or...you could save her!!!    (@.@)
HADletzkaa	I only read the 1st part. Let me tell u, I thought this guy liked me at work. He called me lovely. He went out of his way to make me smile and laugh. Everytime I tried to walk away during a convo he'd bring something else up to make me stay. His entire day seemed to change when I came around cause his frowns all turned to smiles. Je used to watch me walk away till I was clear out of sight.     In reality? That's his way of making a friend. Something I misinterpreted. I took it as flirting. Think wisely and set your heart up for either way so u won't end up hurt or disappointed. Hopefully he does like u tho|`|8pDblyCBaa	stop using so many stars!!|`|COmp4sIuaa	He wants you. Badly.|`|yrtlMEKgaa	He wants you eight ways to sunday.|`|7iQ7Kkdjaa	there are three ways to go about this, first you could assume he likes you, and im guessing you like him too, and go for it.  Or, you could assume hes messing with you, and just forget about it.    heres the fullproof way to find out. let him in your sin cave and if he calls you within a week i guess he might actually like you, or he just wants another go, actually now that i think about it its not full proof, but hey at least this way i helped some guy get laid.    BOOOOOHHHHYAAHHHH!|`|sTqfKpbraa	yup but dont run to conclusions  find a way to let him take this feeling out
fAN2DQJyaa	If she cleans up after herself I think thats fine. Even that itself is pretty great, there are teenagers that don't even clean up after themselves and have straight Fs. I think you should stop looking at only her bad points and see she's a bright child. Until she matures a bit more maybe as a parent you could be a bit more patient. Plus studying takes more energy than you think. After she is done studying she wants to relax not clean and do what she wants to.     If you really want them to help out with cleaning up after dinner take turns or do it together. You can soap it and they can rinse it. That's the way my mom and I do it.     My mom never forced me to clean if I didn't want to. But I felt sorry when she was cleaning all by herself all the time so I would ask her if she needed help and helped whatever she needed.     Instead of trying to come up with methods to force her to clean, think of methods where your child cleans because they want to.     But it is annoying when others ask you to clean up after them like they're the servant...|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	Have them do it together...|`|VMAhim63aa	dont get greedy|`|V9uMoELzaa	I'm 13 to! We just wanna be alone and think about life. For us it is an awkward stage...dealing with girl stuff, drama, and school.|`|PaAZsRlRaa	You already expect so much from her. like the good grades and extra stuff she doesn't feel like she has to do that because she alreayd works so hard. why don't you let the younger one do it.
nNOmxe2saa	going from friend to lover is a complicated trip.  once you cross that line, there is no turning back.  if it doesn't work out between you, that may be the end of a valued friendship all together.  but on the other hand great friendships can lead to wonderful loves.  I guess what I'm saying is to think it over and let her decide since you have done your part in letting her know how you feel.  give it some time.  she may be just as confused as you...|`|qmwRcAvGaa	She probably likes you back if she didn't just come out and say "No"  Maybe shes just reluctant to say yes because it could end up ruining your friendship.|`|8pDblyCBaa	you need to go out with a guy for once.|`|B9dluSbpaa	she digs you.|`|mvaPdekPaa	maybe shes not sure yet and shes not ready to be with u like tht yet... lol tho.|`|AA10420187	Well if she aint gave you an answer already tell her that you really need an answer and that you really care about her and that you want to talk and get her feelings also. If she dont talk about it this time then stop and let her have time , she might just want to be friends.|`|nZ7pGQfFaa	She is probably confused and doesn't know if she should date you.  She might not want to go out with you because she doesn't want to lose your friendship if things don't work out.|`|a4d92f47ac1f629487b14a2e1213f91caa	she likes you.|`|v0V5BKnsaa	back off freak apparently dont since she wont answer u|`|l2mJxB1Caa	she probably wants to stay friends and doesnt want to ruin the relationship by saying something that might hurt ur feelings|`|w1RPYXoiaa	I think she is confused by your spelling ability and sees that as a barrier for getting close..|`|rqNb6FIraa	She doesn't like you as more than a friend but she doesn't want to hurt your feelings. When you ask her out she feels uncomfortable so she tries to change the subject or whatever. Let things just stay in a friendship zone or try and go past it and risk losing her as a friend.|`|3kydegQJaa	She might like you and is just too shy or not ready to admit it. Or she just might like you as a friend and is uncomfortable with letting you down.  The flirting stuff- she could be a natural flirt, she could just like the attention she gets when she does it, or you might be a naturally positive person and just hoping (imagining) it.  But don't take me wrong, it's awesome that you can visualize your goals.  Just put it to better use.|`|eoov5TzUaa	i think she likes you but maybe she's confused. i think you should just let her be. if she didn't take you up on the date when you asked then she's lost out!|`|sTqfKpbraa	well have passions|`|6818f25a8eabb56fedc76f9ebda880d8aa	Sounds like she likes you too but doesn't want to lose you as a friend and that is why she is avoiding answering you. It's hard to go back to being friends if you start dating|`|2Ulnc0ksaa	dude i've been there.. if you really really like her sit her down and tell her.. things could go great and she feels the same or she doesn't feel the same and things either go back to normal or become really awkward between the two of you. Life is full of risks and this is one you have to take if you like her as much as you say you do|`|1Qeg0CQ2aa	if you asked her out twice and she hasn't said yes, just stick to the friendship.  You'll meet someone else.  You shouldn't keep going after someone if they're not willing to commit either way, and she could just be avoiding saying no so she doesn't complicate things.|`|8dce5f218d271227aaf06ce809d7df68aa	I think she may like you but only as a friend. If she really wanted to date you when you asked her out she wld hv been all over tht. So be cool, dont ask her out again, and just be a great friend to her eventually she will see you for the awesome guy/girl u are. And remember if its meant to b it will b.|`|c64339464988241688f21fe6fe705dcbaa	she is shy to tell u she likes u and probably feels aquard cause ur BFs|`|gjcJ0pwVaa	I would sit down with her very seriously and ask her whats up. Demand a straight answer. Unfortunately if shes avoiding the subject i don't think shes into u. It doesn't hurt to ask and you can stop obsessing over it when u finally do get an answer. It'll be a weight off ur shoulders.
fzIeGPZYaa	you REALLY need to have a talk with him. some guys think its ok to say/do stuff because "its online" but its NOT, he is still betraying you and your trust. Tell him how you feel and if he doesnt care enough to do something about it you may need to just leave him|`|Z0VvcKCraa	You shouldn't trust him anymore.  The first time he did wrong., okay the jokes on him because he got caught and he is sorry but the second time around the jokes you on, he did it again even though you two already talked about it.  He is showing you that he won't ever change.  I think you should leave him, he is unfaithful and it sounds like he won't change.|`|y8mRKy2vaa	leave his ***|`|GGSSxFsUaa	Don't "deal" with cheating!|`|iD4ejChZaa	my husband works as a contractor over there, he lost my love, they turn into their true selves, i'm sorry for what you're going through,   they're not good enough for us, they're pathetic, become one of his contacts and inform the other women?|`|KNcZTbqQaa	Hey, I have been added my several men via myspace who I discovered are married and who fully reveal their desire to have someone else (who their wife will not know about of course). It isn't rare for men to do this - they are curious about whether they can find someone else to have an affair with (Not saying your huband is certainly doing that) but I would say that it doesn't look good :(  Maybe have a 'trial separation' if possible|`|ZW1xklaAaa	get rid of the dirtbag|`|VDUDKkRuaa	Wow! That sucks! But it sounds like he isn't being faithful to you. A relationship works 50/50. He's not giving his 50. Try marriage counseling, if he is willing to change and do right, if not move on girl! There are other hot military men that are single and would treat you better!|`|S3UxNOhdaa	I am sorry for your feeling betrayed. He needs to understand that the e-chatting and being on my space as he is doing is for single men not married. Also, that it is emotional infidelity and it hurts. He is puffing up his ego with all the attention and he needs to knock it off. He is probably quasi addicted to it and thinks it's no big deal. You need to let him know that it wounds you to the core. How would he like it, if you were doing that. Don't tell him about what you discovered. Just talk about it again but be clear.  If he keeps lying about it to you then you make up a name and contact him, then oust him in your own way.|`|jOyzcJd7aa	Hi I'm also a military wife and I know how hard it can be since some girls are all over our guys! Honestly I think you should have a serious talk saying that if he doesn't stop your gonna leave and if he doesn't then you gotta leave. Us wives go through so much for them and we only expect the same from them. Good luck..|`|kLtlTyr2aa	Before making any decisions out of frustration, simply talk to him and ask him what he is looking for that you haven't provided him with. Even if you have been as devoted as a wife could be, just pose the question to him. People often look outside of their marriage for different reasons. Companionship, excitement, lust, but very few do it for love unless they feel they aren't getting it with their spouse. It sucks to have to cater to your spouse if you know you haven't done anything wrong but a lot of times it may take a little more involvement on your part to get him to truly see the error of his ways and how much he hurts you by being on-line with other women. I had a similar problem with my wife a while back and she actually did sleep with someone else. We worked through it and I realized what I could do to keep her from feeling like she needed attention from another guy. Once that is established, you've done all you can do. If he persists after that, then it's time for you to find someone who will love you the way you deserve to be loved.|`|unpJVzFSaa	Okay, so I spent a year in Iraq. I can tell you right now that he is cheating on you. That's what a lot of people, not just guys, do over there. I can't lie, I did it. And I never thought in a million years I would cheat. Drop him, it's not going to stop. Your better off.|`|QKnKjYzQaa	If you want to keep him, learn how to please him in bed so he doesn't feel the need to look somewhere else what he's getting at home. But if you don't want to keep him, dump him and move on.|`|oj6wQULCaa	You shouldn't trust him anymore. The first time he did wrong., okay the jokes on him because he got caught and he is sorry but the second time around the jokes you on, he did it again even though you two already talked about it. He is showing you that he won't ever change. I think you should leave him, he is unfaithful and it sounds like he won't change.
GPa7fRDMaa	My best friend was anorexic last year and it was the scariest time of my life.    Basically what I did was be persistant and I tried to reach out to her because there wasn't really any other way I could think of helping her.  Find a way to make him really listen or try and get people he is close to to help him like his best friends. I don't know if you'd want to tell anyone else though.    Talking to him would be your best bet though and making sure he gets help because fixing it on your own probably won't work.|`|BlU3wMwNaa	go to him and tell him the benefits of being healthy.  tell him that he still has a whole life ahead for him and that if he doesnt have a good health, he has nothing.  because if you don't have health, you cant do anything.  family and friends can do so much in helping a person cure bulimia.  i wish for the best for him and his family.  goodluck  i hope i helped|`|UKtfHwfuaa	Well I haven't had a friend that went through this but i suffered from Anorexia and recovered a little over a year ago and the best thing to do is just to let him know you are there. Don't pressure him or make him feel like he is stupid or shady for making his family go through this because thats what my family did. He needs to see a therapist to figure out the root of the problem, just comfort him and let him know you will always be there for him no matter the condition.
UPr0qiDJaa	Gifts=Card.  If it is an engagement gift, a card is acceptable.  If it is some pre-owned appliance or something, I'd say the verbal thanks is enough.  Just go to a card store or dollar store and buy a pile of generic thank-you cards or even blank cards with a picture or design on the front and use those.|`|AA11280073	You must thank people for gifts whether you like them or not. It is very bad manners not to write a nice note acknowledging a gift. Someone spent time and money choosing it. And no, a verbal thank you is not enough. You need to write a personal note to each person who was kind enough to give you a gift.|`|WtzKQVGXaa	yes... you do need to send thank you cards... even you don't like the gifts...lol it just shows the people that gave you the gifts that you cared enough to send thank you notes.|`|tBODwcqXaa	Yep, unfortunately, you are supposed to send "thank you" notes. If you print them yourself, you can do a generic message that you can edit with the name of the gift then sign them all after they are printed. For example,    Dear (Name),    Thank you so much for the (gift). It was so kind of you to think of us during this special time. We greatly appreciate it.    Sincerely,  (signatures)
7foornMVaa	Size doesn't matter!!  My former husband was packing a freaking salami stick and was worthless. Whats the point of having the right tool if you don't know how to use it?  I have had a bf that had an average size and was wonderful! He really knew how to please a woman.    Sex always affects your relationship. In one way or another.|`|WjSJBWl7aa	If you love him it doesn't matter..|`|yrtlMEKgaa	Yes, I've told him. He doesn't seem to mind much.|`|VsLSJ65Paa	Sex isnt everything in a relationship.  Though it might be a important component to some, one shouldnt make a huge decision just based on something so miniscule.|`|AA10420187	No if he treats me good and is polie and nice and kind to me i will be so happy with him . I care about whats inside and im 20 years old and i know that love is what makes a great relationship work.|`|sTqfKpbraa	no  btw am virgin|`|EpOU7vGYaa	i wouldnt care if theyre dick is small as long as theyre not a real dick in real life.|`|h99Mcg6taa	It's not the size that matters, it's the flow of the ocean...the guy has to know what he's doin'.|`|Wf4Tdq9naa	Size doesn't really matter. As long as you love the guy and you are happy. Sex is pleasure, it's not about sizes of your body.
d8685cdfce57268f3ec5dca715629f2caa	Whatever you do, do NOT go to a the girl and say "I am insecure". Don't listen to that bad advise.    Just go up to her and let her know that maybe things were feeling like being too rushed and you are not ready to go there yet. By the same token you appreciate her and want to continue the friendship you had with her because she is just one of a kind and enjoy the way she is.    Just please....please...don't use the "I am insecure" sentence as mentioned by several people or you will look like a wimpy emo and it just plain doesn't sound like a mature man. Be a real man and fess up to it but do it in a sensitive and secure way.    Good Luck!|`|ZiHcxJv7aa	First , dont ignore her like that anymore, i think that is really cruel and immature. What you should have done, and need to do now is talk to her sincerely,tell her that yo uthink she is really cool, and that you really like her, but you just need to take it easy,she`ll understand, and maybe with the time, she detach from you slowly-if that is what you want that is :)|`|veZLfnGFaa	Talk to her and say what you said above.  It takes a big person to do what you are going to do.  :)|`|5BlWxijkaa	just tell her and throw in something special like a box of chocolates tell her in person or write a letter and tell her you just wanna be friends and if tht is cool with her|`|AA10420187	Tell her how you feel and ask her what you can do to make it up to her... Give her love and attention this time. Tell her youre sorry.|`|fWrygrgMaa	Apologize. Admit you were behaving badly, and don't really know why. Just say you're sorry if you upset her.  If the opportunity presents itself explain how you feel about her. Even if it's not what she wants to hear your honesty will be valuable. And then you can get over your guilt.|`|4EqPMLdkaa	Buck up and tell her she's really cool and all and tell her you're sorry for thinking you hurt her. Just tell her you aren't ready for a more serious relationship and hope ya'll can still be friends. What was it that made you want to "kind of start dating her"?  What was it that made you sick of her?  If she's ok with it then you have a true friend. If she's not ok with it then at least you know you tried to do the right thing, and can have the peace of knowing it.|`|qOm71Iioaa	wow... nice going, jerk. Just tell her what you just said, except after tell her that you think it would be better to stay friends because she is such an awsome perosn.|`|N9o2ZEtXaa	Then tell her what you just told us !! Tell her that the reason you ignored her is because you were insecure with yourself and there is nothing wrong with her and that you wouldnt mind hanging out with her sometimes but you just arent ready to be in a relationship because of your own insecurities ! and remember this for next time , that girl you ignored may have been the best thing that ever happened to you and sometimes its hard to heal scars baby !!! Be Wise and Be Kind and Be FAir !!!!!|`|O1lm79EFaa	I think you should fix your mistake...

Just don't keep ignoring her - that's terrible.|`|wRwf1aGKaa	id say just talk to her tell her why you did it, and tell her that you dont think you 2 would work together (unless you do want her back, then ask for another chance) and hope that she understands, if you still want to be friends then tell her that you will be there for her and you want to be friends...basically to make it short, just talk to her about why you did it and what you want to happen|`|YoJbQ0znaa	don't ignore her again.  she probably thought or thinks you don't like her. try asking her out on a date.  not dinner and a movie, something fun where you guys can interact and tell her how you feel.|`|1QGRIyaVaa	You should just openly admit it to her!! Once you tell her...what you just said...she will feel a million times better...and so will you!! :] good luck!!|`|QKnKjYzQaa	Send her an e-mail with your same question and your same description you wrote here and just be honest with her. Women would rather hear you say "I'm sorry" than never say anything at all, even if you think "Im sorry" doesn't cover it. Give her a Valentines present with the word "Friends" in it so she gets the message that you're sorry, she's still your friend, but nothing more than that.|`|NuJako4gaa	First of all, you never avoid a girl when your kinda dating, when you do that, she feels like you hate her now. Like most girls if you say your sorry, they will most likely say its okay but she might break up with you (kinda break up)|`|7BkbvD7Zaa	Apologize.    Profusely apologize.    Tell her what you said above.    Good Luck!    I've been in a similar situation as the girl.    It really hurts when somebody is ignored.    Just my 2 cents.|`|4bd6769f9391604a128cb5de3e4b5085aa	Well, first of all talk to her. Tell her how you think she's a cool person and it was more about you being insecure than her. Explain that you didn't think before you acted and that you never intended to hurt her feelings. Try to make her feel better about herself. Don't promise to get back together just to see her smile if that's not what you want, though.|`|VuDR4fpdaa	First of all, a real man admits his mistakes (just like you did), and that's the first step.  Unfortunately many friendships are destroyed by dating (or near-dating experiences) and there's not always a way to fix the damaged friendship.       I myself am insecure with girls so I can relate.  It's quite stressful to deal with these situations, which make them very difficult to deal with sometimes (well, most of the time actually lol) and unpleasant to go through.  I would recommend explaining the situation to her and apologizing for what you did.  Tell her about what's going on.  Communication is KEY.  Now I'm going to give you the hard truth man-to-man here.  Many times situations like these won't get fixed.  But as long as you try to fix it there's still a decent chance.       Something VERY important to remember when communicating this to her is to NOT get caught up in the emotions you feel as you're gently explaining the situation to her.  Apologize to her and be kind to her but don't get caught up feeling so sorry for her that you do something rash.  This has happened to me before.  I get caught up in emotions and before I know it I'm going out with her again.  DO NOT let this happen.  If you got tired of going out with her once you will again.  You either need to choose to go out with her despite the fact that you tire of her or you need to permanently stop the romantic aspect of the relationship.     Good luck dude.  I hope everything goes well.
yTD84yFlaa	Typically, mother's word = Law.    But really, there isn't any LAW saying that an 18 year old, can't date a 17 year old.|`|sSEy6KYiaa	What you are doing is NOT illegal but what your conservative parents are probably worrying about is that  is that you will want to have sex which you are not legally allowed to do untill you are both 18.    Also a lot of US parents who are Christian don't believe that you should have sex until you are married - Personally I think that is very backward and my suggestion would be to either use the birth control pill and or a condom since I don't know too many teens who HAVEN'T had sex before they were 18 even though they said they hadn't|`|kyTBaYFlaa	she's just looking out for his interests, if he is having sex with you while you're a minor he could end up in prison and be labeled as a sex offender, he would have to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life, nobody would check what the circumstances were. if you were only dating that would be fine, but you say you are already "doing stuff" The law says that you are not legally able to consent so that makes it statutory rape.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	you are close enough in age, no issue|`|RDL3wC62aa	at this standpoint i dont think theres any legal reason why you cant see each other, you have parental permission and he is legally an adult|`|Ro2ObPXlaa	This guys mom is a wacko.  He's 18, he can do what he wants.  Not to mention, he can sleep with you in most, if not all of the United States.  Look up the age of consent laws for your State.    Again, he's 18.  She can't tell him not to see you, but maybe he has to go by her rules since he lives at home.  Have your mom talk to his mom and reassure her.  Maybe that will make her more comfortable?  Also, have him discuss the age of consent laws of your State with his mother.|`|fJMDTjPXaa	Not really sure why your being 17 instead of 18 makes a difference.  It's legal for an 18 year old and 17 year old to be together.|`|3hqynAFVaa	Nope no law, however, it's rape if he sleeps with you.|`|oqh9KThCaa	yea that is bull|`|bHnFzRw6aa	nope... you guys just can't bang that's all.|`|ZnJ2Y5cAaa	Well if ur mom dont care and knows ur like going out and other stuff just hang out at ur house and have him tell his mom that hes goin to a buddys house and have that buddy know about it so that if his mom calls there house or something to make sure he wasnt lying that u have backup|`|6pksPo7Zaa	Kid, I know I come from the UK, which compared with the obscurantist corners of the USA is like the difference between Holland and the Soviet Union, but when I was 17 I had a flat and a live-in gf of 24 and I was living 2,000 miles away from home in Germany.  Um, does the term  'apron strings' spring to mind?|`|lvJUDy78aa	I believe you are allowed to have sexual relations. I believe the law goes as follows    18 can date a 16 year old no less  19 can date a 17 year old no less  16 can't date anybody higher than 18   17 can't date anybody higher than 19|`|ZdSnO8c6aa	You are a minor still... you have to obey your guardian unless you are legally amancipated.  He cannot sleep with you or he could go to jail for rape.  Your mom is probabally doing this for a good reason and because she loves you.  It may seem unfair but that is part of life....everyone goes through it but in the end you will thank your parents for the choices that they make for you.  Just be glad that your mom does care enough to say no...some parents let their kids get away with murder and that's why they end up as nobody's in life.  Just wait till you are 18 you are almost there|`|X66icLrUaa	Yeah but the question manly is..    How long apart can the age be?|`|uIpVvT1Saa	say you're going to the movies or something and he "accedently" shows up at the same time.|`|Ov4RVYa7aa	It's okay if you're 16 or older.  Especially if you knew him since before he was 18.  Besides, you have parental permission and he is legally old enough to make his own decisions.|`|DYe08rDdaa	its illegal.....  if you guys do stuff and hes over 18 and your not    he could go to jail  so um yea......|`|nZjQZxguaa	no big deal, just one age away.  Maybe you should sneak out. Romantic?  Or maybe text? No.  I know! Why not meet at a park or somethin'.|`|PKfy15Dbaa	Actually, it depends on your state. It is legal for you to date, but depending on where you live it could be rape if you sleep together. That being said, you don't want to get on his mom's bad side. Things like that rarely work out. If you really like this guy you can probably wait or talk to his mom about it. Going behind her back will only prove to her that you are too immature to date her precious little boy.|`|ny910VOHaa	You can friends no problem but you should not be seriously dating have sex or oral sex until you are 18 ..His mom is scared for her son ..she like everybody else sees boy's 18 years old going to jail for months and years for sexual activities that were agreed on by 16,17, old girls that somebody reported to the cops ...teachers, other kids,other parents and some of the girls grandparents...I have sons and I have the same concern as his mom...your mom might be ok with it but, there could be someone out there that is not. I have a niece who is pregnant by her bf he is 18 she is 17 ... The teacher called the police and now the boy is looking at child molesting charges...and possible jail time...even thou his parents new and her parents knew they were dating and where fine with it by the way both sets of parents might get charged with accessiory because they knew and didn't stop it... there is a boy in Georgia that is in jail right now for his ex girlfriend giving him oral sex he was 17( the legal age of adult in Ga) at the time she was 16.... they broke up she told her parents he made her do oral sex... both the boy and her say they never had sex but, she abmitted to enjoying the oral sex he gave her.... he is now a registered sex offender for the rest of his life...Your bf mom hears and reads all these stories it scares her .If you Truly care about this boy and he cares about you be smart and just be  friends until your 18 ...you never know who is watching ....
029366e443f706114f76140b91711233aa	First, let me say that I totally sympathize with you! It's so hard being military wife and it's ok to let those around you know that you are lonely so they can be as much of a support as possible.    My son just left for TX for training for the next four or five months and my daughter-in-law (who is expecting my first grandbaby!) can't go with him. They will move to another location as soon as he is done but for now they have to be apart.    God never promised that life wouldn't be hard, He just promised that He'd be with us in good times and in bad. Life is a constant roller coaster of fantastic moments, challenges and then the things that knock you to your knees.    Just know that this would be the case no matter what life choices you would have made. Remember the tough times in life are the times that shape us. Enjoy what you can, when you can and cherish the moments that make you smile!|`|tK7XacH7aa	As much as you hate being alone, think of your child as your husband in a way. You both are together and you should spend time with her and just spend time with her. Just enjoy the time that you are with your honey and do whatever you can to enjoy your life together. Just enjoy time with your child and pretend like its your husband and just show love it emotionally the way you would him.   I hope this helps in any way    I wish the best for you, your husband, and your daughter.|`|t2R3mEMoaa	You really need to start focusing on other things. I know how hard this can be, but as you said you knew what it was about before you got involved. It won't always be this way, but for now he has to put in this time and you need to be proud of this just as we are. Find some hobby's, maybe a part-time job or visit your parents while he is gone. You are newly weds all the time because you don't get much time together and this does make it harder. It is also hard on him knowing how difficult this is for you, so if you can, try to find ways to cope for both of you. There are other wives in the same boat, maybe hook up with them and have a good cry and a good laugh. It will get better, I assure you.
cCFPSAl7aa	just listen to yourself and your heart.  if you mess up,  big whoop.  you're supposed to learn from your mistakes.  honestly,  i should be listeneing to that advice myself.  good luck.|`|IGQw4267aa	Don't waste your time. If your friends say he's no good, trust them. Always put friends first before some guy that won't be in your life for very long...|`|BWttPY1taa	listen to your heart|`|BlU3wMwNaa	if you do really like him alot, then go for it.  i would just get over it since he lied and smokes weed.   but friends know most of the time whats good for you and whats not|`|iiRU9kEoaa	friends look out for you.  listen to them
JyrvQBVgaa	I don't know.. he might be kind of creeped out. Guys aren't really that into romantic stuff like girls are.|`|mefxIQP9aa	Yeah but don't make it sound too desperate or mushy. He might get uncomfortable.|`|PBDXgNBgaa	dont do that i don't know how old you are but actions speak louder than words so tell him you love him rather than a note the note may over do it.|`|VMAhim63aa	not as much as you would, dont scare him|`|EpOU7vGYaa	i wouldnt be crazy about having received a love letter, but i would like to get one and think of her  PS: IM A DUDE LOL :P|`|eoov5TzUaa	most men like when they're girl does something cute like that. make sure it's not to lke iw ant to spend the rest of my life with you kind of thing.|`|4EqPMLdkaa	it depends on what his values are- your question shows where your values lie, if the right guy is in your life you wouldn't need to know because you'd already have the answer.  I'd like to know what does your bf do for you?|`|5b3CJ0dBaa	I'm sure you know your boyfriend better than strangers on the internet so if he's the type of guy who likes mushy love letters then you're golden.|`|4cBbVFIMaa	Probably.  Just.. don't freak him out by saying things like, "I want to spend the rest of my life with you!"  Or something like that.
Z0VvcKCraa	I think you should seek the help of a family member.  Call a sister, an aunt, a cousin, parents, someone that will let you crash with them for awhile.  Once you find a place you can sleep over at, pack your things and wait for your husband to be home, if he is already home, go to him and tell him, you plan on doing things with your life and you don't want to sit there and do nothing like him.  Tell him that you have arranged to sleep over with a family member while he sorts out his life, and when you finally get to the family members house, don't call him until a few weeks an when you do, make sure its because you thought about what you want and what you're going to do.  Give the marriage a deep thought.  Do you really want to put up with him? Call him and tell him exactly how you feel.  If things don't change or he doesn't put up a fight to change, file for divorce, get a job you love going to and go out to have fun.|`|dkUvwXXWaa	Truly in your heart you will and do know what to do... For me when i told him FOREVER that's what i meant.... no sex sucks! I know that we're military! ;)lol but if you feel that its the only way to make you feel better who am i to judge. We have been together for 6 yrs. I thought about other options but at the end of the day when we laid down in bed together or by myself I knew that he is and will be the only one I ever want to give myself to!   Maybe try and figure out a way that he responds to you. You know what i mean... Then try talking about why is it lacking in the bedroom. Maybe you need to approach the situation from another angle?   Maybe some counseling? We did that after the first deployment and just two sessions really helped. We just needed to be able to say what we ment and have the other person appreciate and or accept it. Communication is key! :) I really hope everything works out for you two!|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	Well since he was in the Military for that long he may need counseling and other professional help.  I would get out before you get knocked up.  Hit the gym and get toned up and start dating.  Perks out of this?  what did you want to get out of it, are you contributing as much and you want in return?  I dislike marriage in general but i hope this helps.|`|VDUDKkRuaa	I don't think you problem is unfix-able. I would try talking to a Professional marriage counselor. Maybe they would have some answers. Have you tried different ways to seduce him? Like wearing lingerie. Burning candles and lead him into the bedroom? Or cooking a nice meal with two desserts. I wouldn't divorce him over this even though we need to be satisfied! Hope this helps.|`|wE89mPZ3aa	If you can not talk to him about the problem and he will not get some help for the marriage then you should leave.  You are not happy and why live that way?|`|LMIbr1aeaa	Man and woman relationships is not easy. Everything is good, until the true colors shine out and then every thing is not so great any more.  I get frustrated and very unhappy at times too.  Who wants headaches now days?  Life is already hard as is. Why make it harder?  I try hanging out with other female friends and its not the same at all.  Its like every woman out there is all different in their very own way.  Unique.  No one can be replaced.  I guess you have to adapt to a new person and start all over again from scratch. From the ground up.  The only thing that I see really helps, is the sex part with the spouse. It really irons out the wrinkles on the T-shirt like in flaws, imperfections, weaknesses and defects from the not so perfect spouse in the not so perfect marriage situation. GL

VYVI9H6Eaa	that is wrong... he is obligated to at least pay child support or something and its your prob not your son's.... try to say sorry because it is better for your son to grow up knowing his father    i hope i helped! =)|`|10oCEDMuaa	You need to grow up and be a mother. There is no reason to bring that drama around your child. I understand that you can't take back what you said to the new girlfriend but, you can change your future behavior. You need to talk to your ex and let him know that you don't want to have this drama around your child and you want to make amends. You need to do it for your son - not yourself. Wait until you grow up a little more and you will realize that it isn't worth it.     And, if you guys aren't together anymore - then you have no right to get into his business. You can go to court and figure out custody rights. I know it is hard to take - but, sometimes you just have to.     Be the better person, that is all you can do.|`|UUx74K5Caa	You have a BABY to take care of and raise.  All this stuff you're talking about is RIDICULOUS.   Just take good care of your child and FORGET all this other nonsense.  Maybe the father's feelings will change over time, maybe not.  It's just not something you should be focusing on right now.  Just be the best Mom you can be and the other stuff will fall into place.  No more fighting, please.  For the sake of the baby.|`|CjthzxhCaa	ok well to be honest...  by you talking crap to her..that is a little childish and it shows that your jealous.  It also shows that you're kind of insecure.  Im not trying to be mean about this, but you probably should talk to him about it in a calm manner, as adults would.  This is very common for males to get a girl pregnant then leave.  They don't always intend on getting her pregnant, it just happens.  I think you should talk to him, and not bring up anything about the new girlfriend and such.  Say something like I think you should really spend some time with your son- stay calm, don't yell.  If he says something like I dont want to then well just keep trying to ask him.  After awhile, like a four months of asking.. just stop. Give him deadlines,like come see your son twice by next month or your not going to be able to see him ever again.  Dont ever tell the son that he was not wanted by his father... EVER!! thats the most hurtful thing you can possibly say to someone I hope this helps..  oh and just forget about his new girlfriend... he'll probably do the same thing to her|`|wCpNVVcyaa	i dont noe wht to say. im sorry  u get a new bf, and make him jelous i guess...|`|lrqZHi9Jaa	Sorry to be blunt here but I think its time you grew up and moved on.    You have one man in your life who needs you even if he is only 5 months old.  Im not saying you have to put your life on hold forever but I think you need to understand your ex is not the most reliable type of person...if he was he would be there supporting you and his baby.    He obviously is overwhelmed at the prospect of being a dad and all that entails and is ducking for cover behind another girl.    Dont waste energy or time on either of them...get used to the idea you may have to be a single parent to this little boy and, if his dad does grow up and matures overnight to accept responsibility, then thats a bonus.    There are genuine guys out there, your ex isnt one but you will eventually meet one who is who will love both you and your son.    You are still young with a lot of life ahead of you.  Dont waste a precious minute of it crying over such a loser...enjoy your child's life..they grow quickly and are constantly doing things that will bring you such joy.    I wouldnt even check into myspace...it will only get under your skin and you dont need to know what spiteful, idiotic things these two are doing..you have something far better to occupy yourself with.  I wish you luck|`|QRSRJ7U1aa	OMG Girl you need to grow up like yesterday!  How dare you mess up your baby's chance to ever have his daddy in his life.  That is sooooo wrong in so many ways.    If I can assume that this man will make a contribution to your childs life both financial and emotional and I assume he will or you would have kicked him to the curb already then young lady  you need to take a deep breath and sit down and write a letter of apology to your childs father.  Tell him that you are going to respect his wishes to get out of his business with HER.  (Do I think he should be flaunting HER in your face ... absolutely not but he is doing it and you cant change that.)  What you can to is seriously back down.  Tell him that you do want your child to be able to have a relationship with his daddy and if that means you have to superglue your lips shut consider it done.
dWeHChwwaa	Well.. if you can't be straight up with her and tell her you aren't interested, or you dont want a girlfriend, just be rude and turn her off.   You could try that you just got out of a long term relationship and you really arent looking for anything serious right now  You could say that you were on a "break" with your imaginary gf, and now your back together with her (thats pathetic, i know, but it works sometimes, but i hate this excuse...)  You could tell her/lie and say that you have a girlfriend  You could pretend you dont remember what happened  You could be really friendly, but like always be busy. she'll eventually get the picture..|`|UinOWcMUaa	Dude.. you need to be careful of your actions. There are consequence for all of our actions, and well it's just better to tell her that, her lifestyle lead you to do something with her, and well your not that into her now.

Good luck buddy ;)|`|eoov5TzUaa	tell her your very sorry you didn't mean to act so stupid. you think she's a vvery cool girl but your not looking for a relationship.|`|tivpa7Vlaa	awww man sucks. best bet is to just come out with it and tell her sorry for leading her on, sorry for sleeping with her and it was done under the influence and all wouldnt of happened if you wasnt drunk. hope she takes it lightly and move on with no hard feelings|`|t7XnGkSOaa	ask her to coffee and then calmly explain to her that you would like to remain strictly friends. be considerate of how she may feel in this situation. think about how you would feel in her shoes and then shape your words around that.|`|6blfbeTGaa	Wow. You're a munipulative shallow jerk. But anyway,  I would just tell her, "Hey. I'm really sorry but I'm not reallyi nterested in having a relationship with you. It's nothing against you; It's just how I feel.  I'm sorry."  If she hooked up with you then I'm sure she won't have TOO much trouble moving on.|`|5b3CJ0dBaa	Try dating her, maybe you'll like her personality as well as her body. Or just..tell her nicely, I'm sure she'll get over it.|`|3kydegQJaa	Tell her that you think she's great, but you don't think you're compatable.  That way she gets a compliment and won't be totally crushed that you used her!|`|BINKHZKtaa	Don't tell her the truth.  Girls talk allot man.  Once she finds out you used her you will have a tough time hooking up with any girl that she knows.  You will get a bad rep.      Just be an arrogant asshoel and blow her off every now and then until she realizes maybe you aren't the great guy she thought you were when she was trashed.  ride this one out.  You may break her heart a bit but if you want random hookups with hot chicks, sometimes you have to get your hands dirty.    Hump em and Dump em|`|BbjELH60aa	I think you should start talking to her, but treat her as a friend and let her know that she's very attractive and has a great personality and everything, but that you just don't see her in that way.|`|g5GKcf7daa	sounds like you got yourself in a pickle. Poor girl. but it happens lol. Maybe arrange a date, if you can bare it, and tell her that you just don't think it's gonna work out.  ... or just skip the whole date thing.|`|M79usPMkaa	"Look, we got drunk, i got in over my head."    Or    "**** off! i was drunk!"    Or    You can go give her one of those special surprise valentine headtwists, y'know, those ones that usually result in death.

I HOPE THIS HELPS, AND CONGRATS ON YOUR WEDDING!!!!|`|LAXbJfvwaa	The best thing I can suggest is to choose a song that means something to you.  For example - my husband and I had our first dance to 'Annie's Song' by John Denver because it was the first song we listened to when we got engaged (the longer story goes that we were actually trying to do a waltz to it but it was too fast and so we spent the time between our engagement and wedding learning how to do a viennese waltz!)    I didn't dance with my Dad but if I had I would have chosen either a Buddy Holly song or 'Today' by John Denver - why?  Because Dad is obsesed with Buddy Holly and I therefore grew up listening to it, and Dad used to always sing 'Today' to put us to sleep as kids.    It really doesn't matter what the songs are - no one is going to remember them except you and your fiance - so why not just make them mean something special - even if it is a song that has been done before?|`|RuKK1LYiaa	First Dance- truly madly deeply-savage garden    Father Daughter Dance- Get ready, Get set, Dong Go- billy ray cyrus    Garter Song- Bad Boys-Inner Circle    Bouquet Toss- Single White Female-Chely Wright  Single Ladies- Beyonce  Girls just wanna have fun-cyndi lauper|`|8926df5af8e7cec717561d7fcd237c90aa	Angels Brought Me Here by Guy Sebastian would be a cute first dance song.    My Little Girl or Sing me your song again daddy can be a father daughter dance.    Have a great wedding!!
nCWjdyddaa	Your girlfriend can revoke the temporary custody agreement. However, if she does so and the grandparents file a motion in court, given the length of time the child has been with them, they can probably get an order to keep the child until it is all worked out before the judge.    In Family Court, it's all about what is best for the child. And it's highly unlikely that a judge would return a child who has been with her grandparents for such a lengthy period of time, especially if the mother has been largely absent. I would suggest instead that she talk to them and try to work something out to share custody. It's really not fair to rip this child away from the home she's been in for 11 years.|`|57fZyjvgaa	It's possible.  However, since the girl has spent 11 years with her grandparents, she's settled and it would cause a lot of pain and drama to change her living situations.   Does your girlfriend visit her, or not? If not, there's no reason for her to gain custody.... If she does visit, then it's a possibility, but she needs to consider what is best for her daughter. That's what the judge would look at - what's best for the child.   The judge is also going to look at WHY she gave custody away - for selfish reasons or for monetary issues?|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	what she can do is take it to court.  she gave the kid away, for lack of better words 11 YEARS AGO!!!!  that's not like it was a week or two.  to be honest, unless grama wants to let the girl go, mom doesn't have a rats chance in hell of getting the kid back!!!|`|Xt7jo8bcaa	Alot of us are going to tell u this...Get a Lawyer that deals in family law|`|9sORazX5aa	Not sure of what state you are in, but this is how it usually works. If the paternal grandparents want your girlfriend to have her daughter back, all they have to do is go back to family court to transfer guardianship back to her. However, if your girlfriend wants her daughter back but the grandparents are not willing to transfer guardianship back to her, it will be a much longer process, as your girlfriend would have to hire an attorney and petition the court. This still does not mean that she will get her daughter back, as your girlfriend will have to prove how transferring the guardianship back to her is in the best interest of the child especially since it be 11 years. good luck|`|Z0KQenm9aa	dont know what the state laws are but in ny the child has to be 16 i think to choose where they want to live... sounds like if it was temporary then is could be possible but again you need to speak to a lawyer or the court.|`|MYbRICxqaa	This is the wrong section for this question. I do think she will have to go to court for her child. Is the child happy with the grandparents?
1SxDG5AQaa	I'm a little confused, you said he dumped you, but is he still acting like he's with you?  I'm not sure if you threw him off guard when you mentioned the "L" word.  Alot of men get scared a bit by the "L" word and step back a bit.  I would give him some space without you, he did dump you right, so let him be by himself and see if he misses you.  If your still there for him like nothing has changed, nothing will change.  I will be hard not to seeing him or texting him, yes i did say no texting. But this will force him to evaluate his feelings.  This will also give you time to evaluate your feelings.      hope it works out!  donna ;)|`|OOL4XdjPaa	honestly.. if he says he misses you and everything but he left you and he said he "doesnt know what (he) wants" then...     it really sounds to me like he likes someone else... or had/has a thing with someone else but doesn't know if they want him/will stay with him...    you've become his second choice, but you're better then not being alone if he cant have who-ever this new person is...    is what it sounds like to me. I watched it happened a million times to a bunch of different girls in high school...    I know its hard sweetie, but give it up. Don't let him string you. Ignore him for a while...     till he "knows" what it is he wants.|`|sOVc08Dsaa	He is stringing you along.. he wants his cake and eat yours too.. basically he wants to run outside of the coop but visit your nest from time to time.. he can have feelings but seriously if someone loves you and cares for you they would not be confused to where they stand within the relationship.. keep your third eye open because you can be headed for a serious heart break... so give him an option.. either..or.. all or nothing.. don't settle for second best.. you are far more worth it than being just that..|`|e58d7aa2292998ae82fe1b8e6639092faa	no.  move on.   for the love of dating.|`|Ro2ObPXlaa	Don't fall for his game.  He's just hanging on to you as a spare.  If he wont %100 take you back....cut the ties.  I know it is hard, but you have to move on.|`|kE2CuYP3aa	This happened to me before.I no u don't want to hear this but u need to either move on or stop flirting and making him feel like ur so desperate and u couldn't be happier with anyone else.I no u probably couldn't the way u talk about him.But if he really did want u he would ask u out. If that doesn't happen me and my boyfriend we were like dating b4 we dated we hung out all the time we usually held hands and stuff we went on dates.That works if hes trying to figure out what he wants because then he isn't tied to u and maybe he will realize after haveing other choices that he really will want to be with u ad ur the only one for him.Good luck:-)|`|6blfbeTGaa	Hmm..that's weird. Actually I'm going through that sorta now (My bf and I broke up but we still say we love eachother) except that I broke up with him and we both know why..Basically we still love eachother but we just had to break up for a little bit. We are probably going to go back out but things just need time you know?.You should really ask him why he has other thoughts and what they are about.  Tell him you are really confused by what he means 70/30; It could be anything. Maybe he became interested in another girl and felt really guilty and he couldn't go out with you when he has other feelings. Maybe he just feels that he loves you but he can't handle the relationship anymore. I don't know him-Maybe he's too busy or wants to focus on other things.  Just TALK TO HIM. Hes the only one who knows for sure.  It could be anything. good luck.|`|qJ4mqzrhaa	i think u should just forget about him.|`|FZ10x1RTaa	hes playin you|`|vfj4kyGIaa	Haha I'm going through the exact same thing. But I've decided since it won't go anywhere that I cut him off a little, I don't text him as often and when he says that he loves me i just change the subject.     If you do descide to go back to him then you need to set some ground rules, if not it will get really confusing, and yes even worst then what it is now.     Good Luck!
6lE0ij7waa	No. You will make new friends and life will always get better. We all have our ups and downs. I'm having a hard time right now with friends. I don't know why, I am nice to people.

OPirzwrUaa	thats tuff morgan . aint know easy way. however the mature way is to just sit down with him and tell him how you feel .    understand though , it is gonna hurt his feelings . AND , he is your gaurdian and protector . I dont know how old you are , or what kind of temporment he has . So , I would let him know that you want him to consider it and dont expect an immediate answer . Which you dont want , because it will be based on emotion and not careful thought .   maybe you should try presenting it as an experimental - temporary thing to just spend some extra time with your mom because you miss her   Good luck ,  I hope thats truly what you want and it works out for you.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	tell him you miss your mom|`|Z0KQenm9aa	tough isnt it.  you apparently live with your mom? you can make plans to visit regularly... talk to your dad...|`|35rFgcy6aa	First off it all depends on how old you are... If you are under legal age in your state and your  Mom is the parent with physical custody; however both your Mother and Father share Legal custody then she would have to petition the court for permission to remove you from the State.  If she leaves without him being aware then it is Parental Kidnapping. You  may want to find out all the info before saying anything to your Dad

Give her a 3 months grace period, and she should resurface from la la land now if she doesn't maybe you should then confront her.|`|ShaUAySvaa	uh yeah that sucks and i learned that she was a back stabber and wasn't worth my time, i have better friends now and they make room for me and their bf - usually the bf gets recycled but i will still be there by their side so hopefully they appreciate that :]|`|AX3DQw3Paa	Yep. Lots of times. Confront her about it (nicely). If she doesn't change or tells you to **** off or whatever, then she's not a real friend.|`|0OsqCShHaa	yeah actually, but dont worry so much..u should be by herside.. letting her know that u will be there in the good n bad, cause after all u r her bff and u have to support her in her desitions and be there when she gets hurt cause thats wat besties r 4.
t7XnGkSOaa	well, she doesn't like you because you are her cousin and she is freaked out and scared.  if my cousin was hitting on me, I would block him too. incest isn't good, dude. think about how awkward that would be for the rest of your family. no no no.  find someone else, who is NOT in your family.|`|M79usPMkaa	Put the barrel of a shotgun under your jaw(LOADED) and pull the trigger!!!|`|vfj4kyGIaa	Are you amish or something. Thats uh, beyond wrong. Only animals or people from the early 1800s and before then did that. (shake of head)|`|AA10289302	i don't think it"s because she don't like you why she is blocking you.You are cousins and she knows that .I am sure she would not like to be introducing you to her friends saying ,"this is my bf and we are cousin.Try to forget about her been your gf find another girl ,i think you are freaking her out.|`|ofJOcZc1aa	With all the girls in the world you want to keep it in the family?     It's not right to date people in your family blood or not.|`|WGSx9yfeaa	You said she was your cousin? Well that's why she doesn't want to be with you.|`|5LEE91CGaa	that fact that you said bloking me makes me think you're british or something. if true, all i have to say is "you would(date a blood relative)"|`|qcB23QvZaa	no. do not date you cousin come on man.      she obviously isn't into you    and plus you two will NEVER EVER work out because your family would hate you|`|UMPlbaDGaa	So when you say cousin, you mean she is in the family? Like she is actually your dad or mom's brother or sister's child? And you LIKE them like romantically? Maybe you should think that through again. Maybe you don't like her romantically. You probably just like some of the characteristics she has. Try looking for the things you like in her in other girls.

And you might try to find a monthly rate motel room which my brother did.

Guys are like that. Trust me. Been there, done that.  Just give him time. And if he doesn't call you in the next week, try talking to him in school and making more contact with him.

Here's a thought: confront her.|`|sC2aSAXaaa	If you have that feeling, you are probably right! But don't just jump to conclusions! See if things she tells you are adding up, if they aren't question them. Talk to a friend of hers that you trust and won't say anything! Maybe they can tell you! Talk to her about it to, if you feel comfortable doing that, tell her how your feeling and why, it could be just a big misunderstanding!|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	I don't think you can tell based soley on her words or expressions.  You either believe or you don't.
1c8b3f1b010227dade0229a14ba8bd73aa	Can we swap husbands??  Sounds like my motor, and your husbands' motor, are hitting on the same cylinders; and yours is more of a match for my husband!      I don't really think there's anything wrong with you though sweetie.  Some people just have higher sex drives than others.  I, personally, could have a go everyday.  And because of that, most of my friends think I'm retarded.  Go figure!  We're all made up differently.  But I say that as long as you are still attracted to your husband and as long as you do enjoy sex with him a few times a week, then you're okay.  (But God bless him though.......I know exactly where he's coming from.......)   ^_^|`|gPdj4lCuaa	Your not wrong for having it once or twice a week. My boyfriend and I have it about once or twice a month!!! That is a lot different then most people. We fill in a lot of that extra time like taking up hobbies together. We build snow forts, as childish as that sounds, we walk in the forest, we watch movies, go shopping and adventuring in different towns or city's, play video games, hang out with friends, and just your every day things. Now I am the horny one in the relationship. I always want to have sex, if and when I can. Most times my boyfriend will turn me down and it sucks some times. He claims hes Asexual. I hope he is, or else that would mean he doesn't find me attractive :P or hes banging some other chick :(  Anyways I just want to tell you to be glad you are having it once or twice a week, because I am only getting it once a month :P My boyfriend and I did it on the weekend so I guess that means a hole other month for us to go :(|`|PFBKuVhBaa	guys want it all the time..i figure  girls just arent in the mood as much  sex is great but i wouldnt want it every day..it would get boring and more like a routine.  i think its better that you only want it once or twice cus when you finally do have sex its more enjoyable then to have it every day|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	My GF and I are both very horny people.  We typically have sex once a day. But not everyone has the same sex drive as we do. You wanting sex once or twice a week would still be within the normal range but so is his desire for more often.  There is nothing wrong with either of you.  The problem is how are you going to solve this problem.  Is there something that turns you on no matter what even if you are not in the mood?  If so then tell him to try that.  But he needs to meet you half way and not try to force or guilt you into having sex.|`|mMBzpldbaa	both me and my boyfriend are always horny lol, and we have sex at least once a day, most of the time it's more than that. i understand that you may not be like us, but if he is horny and you don't want to make love to someone who loves you, why not give him a bl0wjob, handjob, footjob or tittywank? i don't see why one partner has to go unfulfilled and i see it as selfishness.
d20mM90uaa	MY HUSBAND WOULD NEVER CALL ME LIKE THAT.... LOL IF HE DID I WOULD BE THINKING THE SAME THING, WHO THE HECK ARE YOU LMAO|`|rcut6bhoaa	Thanks ,  I needed a laugh for the day.

She could have easily thought it was one of her friends playing a prank on her esp. if you don't usually talk to her like this!!

I'm just saying.     Good joke though. BTW, you're a guy named daisy? I would totally change my name as soon as I hit 18 if my name was daisy. But I'm a guy.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	lol.  Yeah, that'd be the wrong answer.
AA10746669	First, you can't necessarily MAKE him realize anything at all.  It depends on how much he loves you.  It also sounds like the two of you don't go out together very often, if at all.  But you must sit down together and try very hard to calmly express yourself.      You do need some kind of occasional enjoyment with him, friends or family.  However, If you are going out to bars without him, that is another story.  If you are going shopping or to friend's homes or to chic flicks, no problem.  Also, if you were to go out every week, that is too much.    I would say that if you are not neglecting him in any way, and you are fulfilling your responsibility as a wife and mother, then you need to ignore his controlling anger, and continue to pursue your nights/days out in an appropriate way for a married woman.      If his anger should continue, and you are consistent in not letting his anger control you, he will soon get the picture.      Hopefully you will be able to come to a mutual understanding and agreement.|`|XjgQ3jDZaa	1st - You are NOT a horrible mom/wife for wanting time away.  2nd - As long as you are behaving when you go out, not a problem, you deserve that.    Send the kids to stay with someone and take your hubby out with you once in a while and see if that helps.|`|f1fe93be7081dc7b9c7e21c7df7c6633aa	What is he mad about when you go out? Are sure it is you he is mad at or is he not handling the kids well and mad at himself?  Maybe he needs a guys night out and you need a girls night out or maybe he knows this but is too tired.  Maybe a babysitter and you can both go out.. Go bowling or to the movies together and the next day sleep in and then do something with the kids.  This is typical parents being burnt out stuff.  He may be jealous that he isn't getting enough attention from you.|`|QCmRRbABaa	You're not a horrible mom.wife because you take a break. You don't need your husband's permission or opinion to do whatever you want. Don't pay attention to him when he's irrational. He's supposed to understand and respect you.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	Everybody needs a break now and than.    Be calm and ask him about his needs and let him know about your needs.|`|SgOVFseaaa	Forget about trying to make him realise.  Do what you need to do.    He probably gets mad because he knows it's effective - it gets you to do what he wants.      Look, you and I both know that you have the right to live your life and be happy.  If you're unhappy, how can you be a good wife, mother or caregiver?|`|ldqQDwI4aa	Talk to him!    Everyone needs a break sometimes!|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	Maybe if you only took care of your own children, you wouldn't be so stressed.  Cut the in-home day care and focus on raising your own.|`|8txWayVnaa	You know what they say:  "If mama ain't happy. . .ain't NOBODY happy. . ."    You deserve time to yourself.  You need to do it consistently--perhaps once a week or once every other week--and eventually he will adjust.  If he doesn't, then that's just too damn bad.  *shrugging*|`|f6a177061a935df6ab959c2ecb265589aa	Hey, the kids need some quality time with their dad, too! And he needs a chance to learn his own parenting style, without you around. So your time away from your kids is for their benefit, too.    Start with something small, like have him take care of the kids while you run to the store. So he can learn to be alone with his kids while you are doing something practical. (Hey, even that is a break for you!)    See if he will watch them for more time when you go out and shop for his birthday present :)|`|f7de2ae21a417e1e00508fc1cb8666e6aa	See if he would be interested in a one night a week or every two weeks designated just for that person. Example: He gets Tuesday nights, you get Wednesday nights. Each gets 3 hours to do whatever the heck they want without the kids/spouse around - unless they want them there. You can go shopping, stay home and take a relaxing bath, read, etc. Then make sure you have at least one night a month that the two of you go out on a date, even if its just out for pizza or something silly. Everyone needs a bit of 'me' time.|`|cGGvZqJNaa	You deserve breaks away from the kids and the house. I say get all dolled up and go out with the ladies....|`|q7z7Ni3Daa	First of all, he does not need to realize that you need a break for it to be true. It will be hard I know, but inform him that you will be going out in a polite tone and what time you will be back. Come back when you say you will. He can be angry. You can't stop that. But you can stop yourself from responding to his anger. You do not need to justify your need for some breathing space any more than I'm sure you already have. Everyone needs it, ESPECIALLY women who give their children intense love and attention when they are together. Maintaining a positive attitude and showing your love and caring constantly is wonderful but draining. When you return, share your happy attitude but no specific details unless asked, and don't respond to his arguments except to acknowledge that you understand that he is upset and then let him rant as he chooses. It is harder at first but gets easier later. You can't have a one-person fight. Remember that!     If it is economically possible and your husband is open to it, have him take off two days and do your job completely, start to finish. It will change most people's perspectives quickly, which is why many men  (and some working women) will not agree to do it. They don't want to have to face up to how hard it is.    In any case, I wish you the best of luck!|`|9gMQAWBNaa	No you are not being a horrible mom or wife. Your husband is being a horrible father/husband. He does not see you as a person, he wants his Mommy and judges everything according to that. Stand your ground and do not back down. Otherwise your life will be one of complete servitude.|`|43010267fa544a0ad1f25fbecbc72571aa	Nope you're not being a horrible mother and wife.  I'm with my kids all the time and for the most part that's how I like my life.  Every once in a while though I get the urge to go out by myself and not have to worry about any one else's needs but my own.  Luckily my husband doesn't mind it.  I don't know how to convince your husband that you need a day out...|`|rcut6bhoaa	Gotta be some compromise in there somewhere.  It also sounds like the relationship is going down hill because of the situation.  If you don't get help now or change something,  its going to get worse before being better.|`|u7f0QB37aa	Depends on what you and your friends are doing|`|CdDM0Xtaaa	There is nothing you can do because if men don't have there own way or they have to do something for themselves or take care of someone else they get mad because they don't want to do it they think that use woman have to do it all the time well they need to wake up and look that us woman need sometime for are self's to not just them.|`|EENUWAP7aa	You wanted kids so take care of them. You love your kids don't you or would you pawn them off to a babysitter so you can go have fun. Think carefully what I just said.|`|vz0tsPStaa	yes.|`|pJQd5Rxwaa	Tell him if he loves you then he needs to let you breathe and have a life from time to time for your sanity's sake!  And no, I don't believe you are being a horrible mom/wife at all.  I think you are being a normal person and he should understand that.|`|w2Z1SV1Gaa	YOU chose to have kids. YOU chose to run an in-home daycare. Why, then, be angry at him because you aren't happy with the choices YOU made in life?|`|INkafu0uaa	you need those Day but also remember your husband feeling maybe just a few time a month stay home with him its only fare!|`|3bAd5B4Gaa	Your husband works full time and farms.  He never gets a break.  I know because my husband does the same thing.     There is a difference between a day shopping and "going out."  I don't believe any married woman or any mother has any business going out at night without her husband.  Hire a teenager to take care of your kids when you want to go someplace.    I come from  a family of farmers and you have to figure out how to work this out on your own.  Farmers can be some of the most triffling people on earth when it comes to getting away from the farm.  They don't understand why everyone is not a homebody like them.  Yet they can't watch the kids much because of the danger in their areas of work.  I've seen silos cave in and fall, tractors flip, and my uncle even lost his arm in an auger accident.    Hire someone to watch your children so you can have a nice day.  Hope you treat yourself to YOUR day soon!

3y0w1qIBaa	As the other two answers stated, call her up after all, communication is the key to the relationships.|`|1eh7GMM2aa	well first of all, you need to talk to your girlfriend and tell her about how you feel, instead of saying this stuff to random strangers on the internet.|`|a3f885953107aeba33459bd9269d3a98aa	call her and tell her what you feel. she might have a good excuse for not calling you.
5DJzp6bMaa	Yes|`|RjpPzbBJaa	If your spouse is in the states, he/she would have to serve you with divorce papers, unless they're claiming they don't know where you are.  The courts require proof of service before allowing the divorce to continue. If you were not served, and the divorce was finalized anyway, then someone may have forged your signature (obviously fraud) and the divorce, nor the 2nd marriage would be legal.|`|Vp83Fuakaa	you are still married to him and he has two wife's now you need to take care of this asap

So you better wake the f.u.c.k up and cease all contacts with him.

If you still love him then maybe consider therapy and working on the relationship, If you have been through too much and need to move on then I think it's best to let your lawyer handle the legal things so that you can avoid him and his drama.|`|uvWuVWb1aa	Forgive him and let him go. It's all you can do. He has put too much stress and baggage on you, and getting back into the situtation will only make things worse. Be civil with him (especially if children are involved) but don't go out of your way to contact him. It's hard, but you can't put yourself through that again.|`|06f1b8496562ceae60b7c13272bc0615aa	Since you dont know and do not trust him (which is smart), you should proceed cautiously. If you decide you want to take him back you should do it a step at a time and make him earn his way back in. I would go through the attorney for now so he does not break you down. His sorrow could be just for himself and not for you which means he can pull this crap on you again if you let him back.  I wouldnt let him move back in even if you decide to give him a chance. Make him prove himself over time and if it is real he will wait for as long as it takes you to trust him even if that is years. If he cant wait then its still just about him and not you. You have every right to protect yourself and be cautious.|`|uXWvDjWHaa	I'm sure he genuinely regrets cheating but you know what they say, Once a cheat, always a cheat. If you let him back into your life he'll think he got away with it. Unfortunately, he'll probably end up doing it again in the long run. Sorry hun, but I'd suggest you talk to your divorce lawyer ASAP and get things moving along.   You don't need a man that doesn't treat you with the respect you deserve!!|`|0AShsMsoaa	he was leading you to say you have a boyfriend.  beware of this ruthless cad.  beware.  in fact, if i were you i would not agree to see him alone.  beat him at his own game.|`|wpi36XBAaa	"His friend told me that he said that this whole thing was the biggest mistake that he had ever made leaving me." There girl is the truth, in a way you don't want to see it.   He is not sorry he had the affair, he's not sorry he cheated on you, lied to you, or hurt you. He's just sorry that he didn't continue with it the way it was - hidden from you.   He's only upset that things have changed for himself, and not all for the better. He doesn't want to have to deal with the ramifications of his choices - the legal separation and maybe a divorce. He probably thought he could have it all, and you have given him a shot of reality that he wasn't prepared for - that his actions, his choices, may well have ended his marriage.  Has he left the other woman? NO - he's still with her. So just what do you think he's offering? To reverse the situation and put you in the role of the other woman to his NEW girlfriend? To continue to have you both? That is all he would be offering at this stage.  If he loved you and wanted to repair the damage he would have told the other woman it was all a mistake, moved out BY HIMSELF, worked on fixing whatever within him opened him to cheating in the first place, and then when only when he's got that all together, then he asks you for a second chance.   It isn't really a matter of what he wants now. What is the real issue is what do YOU want? What do you accept for yourself? His actions were (and are) selfish so you have to be a little selfish too and ask "What do I want for myself?"|`|wSc7ZdBCaa	It sounds like you are living through a very, very strange situation filled with contradictions. Are you being played? What advice would you give if you read what you've written here?  In my opinion you need to:  (1) Consult you attorney, explain what has/is happening, get and take his advice.  (2) Take yourself to a counselor A.S.A.P. With the help of a good therapist you can figure out exactly how YOU feel about YOUR life. After you discover what you think, feel, want and need....you will not have any more questions, doubts or strong emotions invested unless you CHOSE to have them.|`|b90f0a4c32cc3dde140d446b8bb1d11aaa	If you still have feelings for your husband, then you both must agree to go to marriage counseling.  This is very important..Yes, he is regretting what he did, but he must find out why he did it and you have to examine yourself through therapy whether you can forgive him..Right now you are angry and he is not getting through to you, but I would give him a chance, only on the condition that you both go for weekly therapy with the marriage counselor. Also, while you are in therapy, you should not let him come back in the house.  Tell him that you feel betrayed and you have to gather your bearings and you need time to sort out your feelings.  If after months of marriage counseling you feel that you should give him another chance, then do it..if not, then proceed with the divorce as then it would seem you have fallen out of love with him and cannot forgive him and it will not work.  Good Luck to you.

The most important decision you will ever make is who you marry.  Choose with your head as well as your heart.  2.  Have no children until your bond is strong, and have no more than you yourself can support.  You may just have to  3.  At any and all costs finish your education to qualify for those high paying jobs.  It is likely that you will work sometime during your marriage, probably for decades. Get paid for it. And remember, your kids and your education are forever. Husbands, lovers and promises are not!!  (I your case, WIVES, LOVERS and PROMISES are not.)  4.  Have a stash of cash no one knows about even if you are sure you will never need it.  You absolutely will, and the more the better.    When I was "husband shopping" the idea of marrying a ne'er do well, or some poor guy wasn't an option.... hell, I never even knew one, much less had any as friends.  I was in school, then college, ran with a bunch of the show horse crowd, and had a job after that.  So when it was time to think about "do I wish to marry and the answer was 'absolutey' ", brains was number one, along with having a job he liked, and someone I could Respect, Admire, Trust and have Passion for, and if I didn't find all those, I never even dated the guy.  My mama said use my head, and for sure I did.    And I finished school, and got a job.    The deal breakers in any marriage are children, and betrayal..... if they cheat, your gotta leave, and if they just want tons of kids, or even one, and you don't ever, that will never work.  You can rather predict the first one if you know them well before marriage, and you end a lot of rage and resentment if you marry someone within your race, religion (if you have any) politics, way time and $$ ought to be spent, they aren't bi-polar and the rest of the nutty stuff that walks around, but looks perfectly normal for about 6 months.  Time really does bring out these things so, don't just jump in.  About all you don't need is a closet drunk, or some bi-polar chick, prone to jump into some rage.  Like I said, most of this will come out by a year of spending lots of time with them.  Keep your radar on.    If you meet  the right lady, don't marry for a year.  And if you both think you want children, wait 5 before you have any.  30% of all white kids now live with just mom, with dad forking over child support, and 62% of blacks do.      Each group has a high rate of non-supporting men... they marry too soon, there are too many kids, the cost is to high, he leaves.... and moves many states away.  Kids are a 2 decade commitment, and $250,000 each.  Be sure you want one.  They aren't the romantic, "ohhhhh we're gunna have a baayyybeee, aint that sooooo romantic thing.  .  kds are hard work.  So, be sure you do some research before just buying the pile of crap we have all been fed and have one.  Ya don't get to send them back... they become teenagers.    And even if you are a guy, have that stash.  I did, and my mama was right.    I married two nice men, one wanted kids, I left, the second one killed.  But I still have the stash, and live with a man now absolutely adore. (you can sit in your beer and feel sorry for your loss, or you can find a new appropriate love.  I chose the latter.  I love this man more than my next breath.  So, see, love hits more than once.......)    So, hon, there are lots of appropriate partners out there, do indeed use your head, and know her well.    Thank you mama.  You are my hero.  You heped me avoid the traps all my girl friend fell in.  And hon, maybe these will prevent you from falling into any.

8txWayVnaa	Sounds like you're using the line "I don't want to date just anyone" as an excuse.  Everyone thinks "there's nothing wrong with me."  Newsflash:  Everybody has a hang up or two.      While it's important to have standards, it sounds like you are looking for perfection.  Are you perfect?      I'm not saying that you should be a serial dater, but you should date more often and a variety of people.  Also, perhaps you should change your perspective on dating.  Don't view each date as a long-term relationship prospect.  Take one date at a time and get to know a person.|`|5DB6nOXkaa	That's how I felt for years.

d2QiTUWiaa	Don't change schools.    Be yourself. People will flock to you because of your confidence. You know how every school has the different "groups": the nerds, the goths, the preps, the jocks, etc. etc. well people get placed into those groups by acting like who they are. People who kind of teeter-totter in between to find acceptance never get anywhere. You may or may not be like that, but ... seriously just be yourself and don't change for anybody.    Also, wouldn't changing schools hurt your best friend? Consider yourself lucky you even have a best friend because a lot of us (I'm in college) don't have best friends yet and are pretty much struggling, looking for friends to even hang out with.|`|fJ7E43kWaa	All is not lost. Former enemies have become some of my best friends. Try to make do the best you can with your situation. If all else fails, you go to a new high school in 2 years.
fH2Fw4QEaa	My wife has hit me in the head on a few different occasions ( once was because I wanted to put my baby to bed). I have fought professionally in mixed martial arts competitions, so she seems to think that it isn't that big of deal.    I have never laid a hand on her because it just isn't the correct way to treat people regardless of what your gender is.    In fact just the other day I had wanted to leave our house with my daughter's passport and social security card in order to go talk to a lawyer. My wife pushed me and pushed me about the house while her mother in law blocked the door to the point that I couldn't leave the house without actually putting my hands on her, so I couldn't leave because I won't put my hands on her. Finally, after leaving the passport and social security card, I was allowed to leave.    Whether you are a man or woman, if you are in a relationship that has physical violence involved....leave. There is no fixing this.    I have and never would report this to the police because I simply loathe having anyone that isn't family involved in my affairs. None the less, it does happen and it is part of the reason that I am leaving her.|`|f1xaidEHaa	my ex and i mean ex outweighed me 100 lbs and if i did not do as she said she liked to hit and withdraw sex she was not like this before we married she just got angry over gaining weight 100 lbs i guess|`|iM2BaJbeaa	I went through emotionaly and physically by my ex husband. He was fine until we got married after being together 3.5 years. After we were married he bacame very controlling a VERY differnt person than i knew 3 weeks into the marriage i was terrified of his reaction to things and i felt more alone then anything. He would do things like when he wanted sex if i didnt give it he took it, if i cooked something different from the way his mother did he would throw it off the table. i wasnt allowed to go clothes shopping with out him, and i couldnt wear anything form fitting. Of course he was excited when i put on about 40 pounds said he was glad i look like this bc know one else would want me stuff like that....the physical stuff started when i started my own cleaning service with my mother and started loosing the weight slept by her house alot so i didnt have to deal with him and they new nothing of what he did to me. It was like a vaction for me almost like living too lives i was more happy and even met someone else, not by choice it just kind of happend so of course it all starts when i was in the shower he was swinging his arms and ACCIDENTALLY punched me in the face and slwly progressed to hair pulling and throwing up against the wall. so i called my mom and my father made him leave my house. She came and stayed with me for a while and i filed for divorce and started talking to my hubby now :) he was my savoir if he would have come when he did i would have probably killed my self. it wasnt as easy as it sounds on here just too many details and uglyness to type but this is something you can use for an example|`|xlm20MZ1aa	No
R0Mgjkgzaa	Hi. Sorry to hear your having problems. !st of all, is it your mum that wants you to be a mechanical engineering or did you pick it yourself and didn't like it as you went a long? If it's your mum that wanted you to go into M.E -ing, I'd say she is trying to live her life dream through you and that is not right. She seems like she is getting mad and hitting you and kicking you out of the house because it's not the choice she would pick for you and that is what is making her act the way she is. Try not getting too mad at her(I know it hard not to with how she is reacting). But parents just want what is best for us and she must think the best University and being a M.E. ing is the best for you, but at the same time, she need to weigh in your happiness. If being a doctor is what is going to make you happy in life, then you should be a doctor. You only live once so live it like you want to, not how your mum wants you to. In short, I think you should go for your dream and become a doctor. I hope everything works out for you. and good Luck!:)  Cheers!  V|`|tnPw8rwsaa	I understand that you want your parents to be on board with what you want to do, but you can't compromise your dreams because they want you do something different. My dad hates the fact that I switched majors and he always brings up the fact the Chemistry could make me so much more money but it's not what they want it's what I want and I couldn't do that for the rest of my life. That's the way you have to think about it. You have to do what you want because it's your career and your life. I know it'll be hard but I promise it'll be worth it.|`|q5DTcOuaaa	You want to be a doctor? I hate those! They say they will make you better but all they do it stab you in the butt with needles! I had that done twice today!! Ugh!!!|`|hdNcvEq3aa	your mom sounds terrible. it is your choice what you want to do in life, not hers, i say get a roommate and move out and study to become a doctor like you want|`|w3oVzM2Zaa	yikes your mom sounds controlling & abusive.If your smart enoughtto get into such a college you obviously got your head on straight.College is for your dreams  & goals.What you want to become.Ithink your amazing that you want to become a doctor.Your a grown up now.You make your own decisions.Your moms got to deal with that.It dosnt give her any excuse to to touch you.hope e/t works out! remember your not living for her.good luck! best wishes!|`|OMnNgbMlaa	oh im so srry
iT3GOZwHaa	Unfortunately, this girl, knowing that she talks too much, would probably have already stopped if she could. As annoyed as you are, telling her isn't going to fix your problem. It will only upset her. It's very kind of you to put up with her, so please, continue to do so. The poor girl has no friends.. you putting up with her improves her life dramatically.|`|GG1oN4rSaa	You could say:  Could you slow down and not stress us both? And be nice to her even when you get pissed because this is important to her.   Unless you have the guts to tell her you talk to much and slow down and talk less. :) but in any case you should stay nice and not yell or such.|`|4fikqmnUaa	Heya. I know its difficult because you dont want to be known as her mate, but maybe just put up with it for 5 minutes or so a day by your locker. If she doesnt have any friends, then thats a good enough reason to do so.|`|Fc1fxCU8aa	is her name sarah...?    uhm sry just asking cause yeah...    well when u tell her that she talks to much, do it at some place were there is no one, so u won't b accused for making her cry.   Just tell her honestly, that  she just talks too much and should learn how to listen and talk. not just talking, listening too. just make it simple.|`|6BwCwuHwaa	MAYBE WRITE HER A LETTER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL HER AND STICK AROUND TO SEE HER REACTION AND EXPLAIN TO HER IF SHE LACK WHAT EVERYBODY HATES OF HER THEN SHE MIGHT ACTUALLY MAKE FRIENDS|`|Jitpsvghaa	Just be her friend and listen. See whats really bugin her and If you start askin questions more maybe she'll shut up??? idk. good luck!|`|tNSkgDMzaa	just say "i got to go to class" or say "I gotta visit a teacher"  if that doesn't work just talk over her or go to your other friends    no wonder she doesn't have friends she's a crybaby  Why do ppl tell her she talks to much but she still talks >  what a spazz|`|RvddYKqjaa	I think it's very sad that a young girl is the laughing stock of the school.  She can't help how she dresses. Her family may not be able to afford designer clothing. As long as she is clean, it shouldn't matter. You don't tell her nicely or any other way that she talks too much. You can answer her politely. It would be really neat if a group of you would befriend her and help her rather than laughing at her. It's a shame that you can't take it anymore. She really isn't hurting you. She's just talking and you don't have to listen all day or anything. Ask to have your locker changed. Switch with someone.|`|mRun89yLaa	Asperger syndrome right? Stand still and don't speak and she won't see you. than when she wonders off RUN!!|`|UmMxmmRMaa	Aw, I hate to be like this, but just think of how SHE must feel. I don't think anything bad will come of you listening to her just when you're at your locker. If you NEED to get away, politely tell her you have somewhere to be and don't want to be late. I understand how you feel, but realize that this situation is a little bigger than just you. If you feel harassed, I'd recommend telling a guidance counselor who will know how to deal with it properly.|`|X5fEQGgNaa	Mayor McCheese says:    "try something subtle. perhaps, 'hey, is that a whale feeding or did you just open your goddamn pie-hole yet again?'  the astute listener will pick up on your hidden message that you wish for them to STFU and leave you alone."    The Cheese has spoken.|`|cSOpcKOWaa	Ok it sounds like this girl might have something related to what my stepdaughter has. It is an actual problem, so lets not discredit that she is actually trying to befriend you and not drive you crazy. Tell her to slow down talking because you can't understand what she is saying. She probably isn't going to stop dressing like she is 5 and probably not going to stop talking to you no matter how mean you are to her, its probably not in her nature to "get it". Ok. So the best thing you can do is tell her if you are going to talk to me, you need to slow down and breathe so that I can understand what you are saying to me. If you see her wearing something that looks half way decent compliment her on it, and say ohhh that would look nice with a pair of jeans or whatever would match it. Tell her to pull her pants down to her waist ( my stepdaughter hikes hers up way over her belly button making anything else she puts on look silly). Show her where her waist is. Coming from a peer she might listen. I know that its frustrating to you, but the best you can do is try and help her fit in a little more because she is not going away. Let it be your good deed for the day. It might make you feel better. People like her are often the most loyal friends in the end anyway.|`|I6dcRgD6aa	tell her you have an ear ache & can't hear too well so this way she will cut down while you are going through that or get her to write what she wanst to say down on paper. That will slow her down. Or you can tell her you were thinking of her cause your neighbor was saying the same thing she said. Your neighbor told you she started weighing her words in other words she cut back on her talking & it changed her life cause she wasn't changing people away. So the girl can get an opportunity to see she needs to change.|`|y3cRCLSpaa	You have to handle this delicately because she has no friends.  Every school has the kid that a laughing joke, and sometimes you can avoid it and other times you have to be the bad guy to straighten him/her out. She's never been mean to you, so you can't be mean to her, general rule.  Just say, "Please don't take offense to this, but you talk way too much. [Insert something positive about her talking, like she always has something interesting to say]. Suggest that she might make more friends if she took the time to listen to them." Hope this helps.

My ex wife used to spy on me when we separated. Just google it, I saw one answer with the link to the website a couple of weeks ago here in Y/A.|`|JkvlAVX2aa	It depends...    If she always has many friends and she likes to keep in touch with them often, then you are paranoid.    However, if her behavior deviates drastically from her past behavior and she has become very "protective" of her iPhone (as in you can't see it), then you have a telltale sign.      I would suggest that you keep the suspicion to yourself.  But be alert in trying to spot any additional telltale signs such as:    1. Suddenly wants to dress up more and puts up more make up.  2. Working out much more to get in a better shape.  3. Suddenly has more excuses of staying out longer  4. Start to pick on you about small things  and so on.|`|5Qo6OWNzaa	That is a symptom that could mean she is cheating. It may not be that, but it certainly is one of the things to look for. If you secretly check her phone you might as well divorce her because if she ever found out it would be over either way.|`|uXWvDjWHaa	Hmmm... Once you go there you can't go back. If she finds out you're snooping around you may lose her trust.   But, to answer your question, I'm not sure if anything like that is available. Probably somewhere but I don't know where to get it.
AA10199189	hi    you should demonstrate your sincerity by going for self-improvement courses - you don't seem terribly literate and that can add to your frustrations and anger.  and you have to win them over with actions, not words.  the best way is to go slowly, so that they can adapt.|`|f3n2zXG2aa	I notice your name is dark.

Good Luck!|`|FHu7pHhRaa	Maybe you should get their mother to talk to them about it  and also, to show them you mean it this time, you should get yourself on an anger management course.  Also, if they do start to come round, take them out for a really fun day and let them decide what they want to do, this will reassure them that you love them. If their mother is atall worried then bring her along, but make sure that you pay for everything - it shows you care.  x|`|4c0zHQqWaa	Women are more apt to forgiving the father because she still obviously loves you. Alot of women are blind to it. I know you don't want to hear this, but you don't deserve your children right now. Nor do you deserve your wife. You need to get your act together before you go back to live with them. What is stopping you from going to anger management now? And what is going to make you go when you move back in with them. You will have no motive to do so when your back home.      Your children do not deserve to be abused. It is absolutely unacceptable, and while I am sure you understand that it is not right. You do not understand the effects it has on children. They aren't strong like the mother and hide away mad feelings towards you. You can't just expect your children to up and forgive you and think that they will trust you instantly. Those things take time.     You're going to have to work your way back in to being a father to your daughters. Girls are very emotional, so you want to do this the right way. Because things like abuse (verbally and physically) can really mess up a person.     Best of luck to you and your family.|`|syWS4ep1aa	you deserve to die a horrible and painful death for hitting your children. you bastard!  you must apologise to them and never, ever, ever even think about hitting or swearing at them. you must take anger management and DON"T take Change that is not needed's( what a name) advice and keep as far away as possible from religious texts.  you should be thankful if they'll even spit on you.
AA11080047	myself i would distance myself from them there users. you and your guy need to sit down and work out a solution because i get the impression it would not bother you if you never set eyes on them Again next time they come to Visit make sure You don't have anything in or you have to go some were else to visit yourself.
WDs4fRoxaa	Get voice mail or an answering machine.    You can dial for the kids to call him back.    You only need to call him back when necessary.    If he calls you at work. Tell him that you will return his  call when you get off of work.    He is just trying to have control over a situation that he  no longer has control over.     Best wishes|`|5DJzp6bMaa	Yes You Can|`|1sRqj5fhaa	YES.....|`|ByUS0k8waa	Why not talk to him and ask that you guys set aside a time each day at the same time. He can talk to them at that time for as long as he wants to. I think its wonderful he cares enough to call. My ex never calls about my daughter. Not even on her Bday. Doesn't pay his child support or see her for years at a time. I do think you guys need to come to a agreement about when or how much is to much but other than that I think he calls cause he is lonely without them or misses them.    Also it doesn't matter if my daughter is gone for part of the day or just over night I call to check on her. I have to tell her good night before she goes to sleep at night and I could not imagine not talking to her for a week at a time. That is insane. If you want to bother him then call him as many times a day as he calls you when he has the children. After a few weeks he will give in and stop calling as much.|`|aXYiOskmaa	this is bordering on harassment. lets face it, your kids aren't at work with you right? then there's no reason for him to call you at your desk. i'd definitely file a complaint with the police.
AA10876923	No one does anything to us, unless we ALLOW it.  With that said, and no intent to be harsh.......You are allowing him to use you as his backup.....and you are making a fool of yourself a well.

It would be best if you two do not communicate at all.|`|AA10986891	He does not want to discuss it cause he suspects you want to get back together with him.

I think back-up would be a good definition of what you are for him. Don't even give in to his mind games.

I get the feeling she even heard you walk in and is just playing it off.|`|511f36b32bab3f108f576850ec28ee32aa	It would be awkward telling her you saw her...so I suggest make up a situation|`|X14EmlrXaa	uh, wow. Well first, how old is she? because if she is young i think you need to tell her parents. I am 15 and pregnant and it was a horrible mistake.  So if she is like a teenager:  tell her you saw her and her boyfriend. tell her you would not have done that and would have knocked but you did not because she said she would probably be in the shower. Make sure she knows you are sorry. Then start telling her you are worried about her. You do not want her to get pregnant, STDS, or anything else. Tell her if she doesn't stop or AT least get better, your gonna tell her parents. Tell her you are not trying to be mean or a "bad Cousin" tell here you are trying to protect her    If she is an adult:  it don't really matter. but you still shouldn't lie. Tell her you came over and saw that you were "busy" and left    Hope this helps    KEEP ME POSTED|`|d7TgV7fcaa	if its naggin at u then best thing to do is tell her if u two are close she will understand after all u are not in the wrong she told u to come over and u did and accidently walked in on her jus say u didnt see anything like body parts or anything tell her u didnt want to say anything before cuz u thought she would get mad or sumthing and if she does hate u or watever which would be really bogus she treats like crap then jus tell her parents lol|`|1PdemW6baa	I honestly prolly wouldnt say i saw her doing it lol to awkward for me i would just say something did come up and it was an emergencey or something like that lol...|`|d08rkYlpaa	Guess what. You won't like it, but it's probably true - she wanted you to catch them having sex.  Think about it - she said she would be in the shower.   She said just go ahead and use the key.  She knew you were coming over, but went ahead and had sex with her boyfriend anyway, knowing you might be there any minute.   She talks to you about sex, including talking about her sex with him.   And she has involved you with intimate details of her life for weeks at a time.  It was no accident.
DZCFD0p2aa	kick her out of you gang.|`|7ko9czaaaa	let her go she was not a real friend.|`|g5cfv7pcaa	That happend to me too. I just decided to wait until she got out of her phase...but she never did so I found out that I really didn't need her as my friend anymore. So I guess you should just ignore it and wait to see if she is still your friend after a while. if she doesn't then I guess you know which people really are your TRUE friends.    Also don't fess up to her and ask her to come back with you guys. Just act like you are having a lot of fun without her.
nfGDZWfBaa	what was your question|`|MeGazyy7aa	Okay, it's bad enough that you TALK like that, but you TYPE that way too? Pathetic.
RtkB46peaa	Usually the proposal is a good indicator.  If you don't know him enough, or can't tell if he's serious, then maybe YOU are the one who isn't ready..|`|y5j97EXuaa	Marriage is never a sure thing. Just be prepared for a possible divorce in the future so your heart doesn't get destroyed. There's no guarantee. Just make sure that none of you has mental disorders. Make sure that the guy is in charge. Make sure that God is the center of the marriage. Make sure you two are compatible. Make sure that you are both forgiving on each other's sleeping patterns. If you are not sure and you won't let him lead and make decisions for you both, don't get married to anyone. Before you jump in - make sure. I've typed those 2 words many times to get it in your head. So MAKE SURE.|`|IvMPh09baa	does he make goals for the both of you and your future?  For example, a house, kids, location... etc.    Make sure he isn't marrying just for the benefit of saying he's married... it takes alot more maturity than that.  Make sure you are with a man that is ready to step up to the plate and build a future with you, together.|`|6fLxNyVpaa	well he just proposed so seems to me like he is ready
