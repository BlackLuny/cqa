I listen to bands like Oh, Sleeper, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Born Of Osiris, As Cities Burn, Etc. What brands should I look at Johnson, ESP, Ibanez? Could you also recommend an amplifier? I just want something small nothing too crazy?      Also I'm thinking about going to DC music store to get it. Are they a rip off? Would it be best if I just went there and have them hook me up?      Also in case you need to know I'm around 5' 8". I guess I have average length arms.      Thanks in advance.

I think it would be awesome to work with her in a mini photo shoot even though I have no experience and neither does she. I don't even have a professional looking camera but I am willing to buy one in hopes that this might work and maybe asking a few more girls. The problem is, I have no idea how I would go about doing this and if she would think this is creepy or not. The pictures would not go on the internet but more for her personal use. How would I ask her if I even should?

In the good old Adirondacks.   Mighty and true.    I put on my boots and my snowshoes.   We hike on by day.   We pack up by night.   The blizzards ablazing.   We bundle up tight.      In the good old Adirondacks.   A fire burns bright.   We set up the camp.   And stay within Sight.   We start our day laughing.   We give it our best.   Come nightfall though and we are needing a rest.      In the good old Adirondacks.   We begin our way back.   back to reality.   Where all is pitch black.       In the good old Adirondacks.   Proud and Steadfast.   It shall live in our memories.   As long as we last.

I just want to be near you, to whisper in your ear,   to hold your hand, to wrap you in my arms all night long.      I should be sleeping now, but I can't stop thinking.   thinking about the late nights talking on the phone,    that voice that ignites my passion for your love.      I'm trying to be patient, but I feel unloved.   I can't just be surreal to you any longer.   I wish we both could just want the same thing.      So as time moves on, I hope we get together,    So when the time is right, I can say - always and forever.   And right now, these feelings I have to hide,   Because I’m afraid, ill lose this chance for life.      So from this day onwards, I will wait,    For you to come and tell it straight,   While I reside numb in this heartbreak

20090227060739AATx4oy	Arts & Humanities;Books & Authors	Am i a talented writer?(i'm 16)?	Chapter1        It was nearly midnight. A tall, broad shouldered man walked down the gravel lane. he climbed the first two stony steps ,and knocked at the door. The house was silent. A moment later, the yellowish light of the living room filtered through the drawn curtains, and the door swung open.           A man in his sleeping pajamas gazed at the unexpected guest. ”Byron??” His eyes widened in surprise. The guest pushed forward without even being invited. His black, leather coat was stained with mud.. The man closed the door, and followed his guest with a mixture of dismay over his long face.           “ Won’t you show me some hospitality Elliot?. It had been a long time since last I saw you, ten years, I guess” Byron said, resting on the sofa." I'm not here to waste my time. There’s an old unsettled business I need to finish with you”           “There is nothing for you to settle with me Byron. I’ve abandoned your filthy business a long time ago, and I won’t meddle in it once again”. Elliot turned to the entrance door, and opened it wide” I think that you need to leave”        Byron pushed himself off the couch, pointing to the wooden staircase standing at the end of the living room.” I guess that victor will be happy to know the nature of his father’s work, won’t he??” Byron smirked at Elliot” I know many ways through which I can find victor and tell him the truth, guess what he’ll be ashamed of his father. I can simply go up right now, wake victor, and tell him every single detail of our filthy business,” He walked towards Elliot, and whispered in his ears” and you won’t be able to stop me”           A moment of silence passed, with Elliot staring right into Byron’s blue eyes, Elliot considered the warning for a second. If victor knows anything about him, for sure, he’ll reconsider their relation as a father and son, besides, any secret of Elliot’s past being slipped into victor’s ears would throw victor into great jeopardy, and Elliot daren’t risk his only son’s life.           “Fine Byron, Follow me”. Byron raised his eyebrows triumphantly as Elliot approached a white curtain hanging down from the ceiling. He pulled the curtain open, and instead of a window there was a wooden door. Elliot turned the bronze knob, and Byron pushed into the room.           Before closing the door, Elliot twisted his head ,and ran his eyes up and down the silent living room making sure that Victor wasn’t strolling somewhere in the house.           “What do you want then?” Elliot said locking the door, and glaring at Byron who sat down crossed legged in an arm chair in front of the hearth” finish it Byron, or else….”        “or what Crow?? Speak.” Byron stole a contemptuous look around the room .it was quiet. Nothing stirred, save for the fire eating at the branches of wood at the fireplace.          After pulling out a chair from an oval table beside the wall, and placing it in front of Byron, Elliot grape a magnifying glass from the same table, and slid it into his pocket making sure that Byron didn’t see it.           “Still playing with your old set Elliot, I can’t help but remember the old memories” Byron said, looking at the oval table that was laden with all kinds of slithery tubes, colorful mixtures, and tomes of advanced math.           “Finish it Byron” Elliot interrupted placing his elbows on the arms of the chair           “Fine Elliot” Byron lit up his pipe and blew out heart shaped fumes. ”Our master Elliot, we must help him. It had been ten years since the last time he walked on this earth, we don’t know if he was dead or alive, but we’ve to find him in both cases. We……”.BOOOM           A short, hunchbacked man leaped off the mouth of a trumpet belonging to a broken c.d player. The man rolled for a few seconds on the floor, before he picked himself up, and bowed in front of Elliot’s chair.        “Sorry, sorry master”        “It’s ok Grimsnail, have you brought what I asked from you”        “of course master “.After flinging to the ground the orange cat  that has been purring  in rhythms in his arm, Grimsnail fidgeted inside his patched vest’s pocket , ” not now Grimsnail, as you can see we’ve guests” . Elliot widened his eyes in warning at Grimsnail who barred his yellowish teeth at Byron .   Neglecting Grimsnail in confusion, Byron’s eyes swerved back to Elliot, and before he continued his talk ,Grimsnail was already sucked back into the trumpet, along with his cat.      “Elliot we must find a way to retrieve Godnofer back” Continued Byron.      “How dare you mention his filthy name in my house”      Ignoring Elliot’s remark, Byron continued gazing at the trumpet, excepting Grimsnail back at any moment.” he has been trapped for  years now, you must help us Elliot, you’re the only one that can re-open the portal”      “I told you Byron I’m out of this game, I’ve a son now, he’s enough for me, I can

20090304090232AAIib4W	Arts & Humanities;Poetry	Have you heard the tale, o' the Weepin' Lass?	The weeping Lass.         Fur three years, Mary walked the night   Tay sit and watch while ithers sleep   She’d watch the lads and lassies dance   Whilst there, in shadowed hue, she’d weep.      Her ain true love, had gone tay sea   Not dead!-prayed she. Lost tay the deep?    So she’d watch the lads and lassies dance   Whilst there, in shadowed hue, she’d weep.      The courting couples, summer nights   Oot by the crossroads, vigils keep   But she, in mourning cursed their lights   Whilst there, in shadowed hue, she’d weep.      Then came this night from oot the throng   A shape, strange but, familiar yet   Between her and the ither’s song   Approached a young man’s silhouette.   Who asked her in a voice sae deep   “Why sit you here, ‘n shadows weep?”      Her ain true love was here at last   Her hehrt lept frae it’s trance.   “Where hae ye been, these three years past,   while I hae watched the ither’s dance?”      He took her haun and bid her walk   “Come see where I hae been”   My place is drab and dreech an damp   On the ither side o’ the village green.      Soon they came tay staun upon   A bankin’ where she spied his smirk   He pointed tay a pauper’s cross   The graveyard o’ the village Kirk.      “You feel the dampness o’ my suit   upon my weary back, my dear?   For you have held me to this earth   With every everlasting tear”      But now you’ll feel my bony kiss   and lay with me, as was your wish.      In fright she ran, ran with her all   Scarce noticing, she’d left her shawl…..         (Some days passed by, before the local villagers discovered a small piece of cloth,   partially buried at the edge of the graveyard. As they dug through the loose ground to free it, they came across a shallow buried coffin. As the shawl appeared to be jammed in the lid, they prised it ajar, to find it was gripped tightly by a bony hand. )      (Based on a Scottish ghost story)

20090304091058AAf6jUv	Arts & Humanities;Performing Arts	Learning to play the guitar?	Okay, so I really want to learn how to play the guitar, but I know nothing about them, so I have a few questions.      1. What type of guitar should I buy, where should I look for it, and how much will it cost?    2. If you learn how to play the acoustic guitar, does that automatically mean you can play the electric guitar, or is that like, a whole other set of lessons? (Because I want to play both)   3. Am I too old to start learning (I'm 16)   4. About how long will it take to learn how to play (A year, 3 years, 10 years?)   and 5. Where should I go to get lessons and about how much will it cost?       I know I'm asking a lot of questions but If you can help me, please do, even if you can only answer one, because I really want to learn. Thanks in advance.
