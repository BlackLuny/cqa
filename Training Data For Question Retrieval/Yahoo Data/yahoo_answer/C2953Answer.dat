GLDZz7aWaa	*sigh*<br>  <br>  It's hype. Seriously. ...I don't know where you heard it from, but they pretty much have no idea what they're talking about.<br>  <br>  The chance of getting cancer at some point in your life is a little over 30%. Almost one in three. Now, it is true that some antiperspirants and deodorants use metals and chemicals that are somewhat carcinogenic in large doses. But we're talking huge doses here.<br>  <br>  I mean, if you were to eat the deodorant stick, you might increase your cancer risk by .000005% or so. Which raises your cancer risk to a whole 30.000005%! Oh noes! (Yes that was sarcasm.) You're a lot more likely to have a high risk of throwing up than you are to get cancer from it.<br>  <br>  Or look at it this way: Oxygen, O2, the stuff we breathe every day until we keel over, is a biradical. It really, really increases our cancer risk. (This is actually one of the major reasons human cancer risk is so high, actually; our whole metabolism is based around using O2, a carcinogen.) In fact, O2 is far worse than the deodorants you use. So you really shouldn't worry too much about the deodorants when just breathing will increase your cancer risk.<br>  <br>  (As will using spices like pepperment and cinnamon, or eating meats cooked in a sugary sauce, or ... you get the idea. We are surrounded by stuff that increases our cancer risk a tiny, tiny amount. It really isn't worth worrying about, and it probably isn't worth your time to try to avoid every little risk.)|`|0d3d4bb36620597a6b1cbe916b531361aa	The reports have suggested that these products contain harmful substances, which can be absorbed through the skin or enter the body through nicks caused by shaving. Some scientists have also proposed that certain ingredients in underarm antiperspirants or deodorants may be related to breast cancer because they are applied frequently to an area next to the breast.<br>  <br>  However, researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), a part of the National Institutes of Health, are not aware of any conclusive evidence linking the use of underarm antiperspirants or deodorants and the subsequent development of breast cancer. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates food, cosmetics, medicines, and medical devices, also does not have any evidence or research data that ingredients in underarm antiperspirants or deodorants cause cancer.<br>  <br>  Aluminum-based compounds are used as the active ingredient in antiperspirants. These compounds form a temporary plug within the sweat duct that stops the flow of sweat to the skin's surface. Some research suggests that aluminum-based compounds, which are applied frequently and left on the skin near the breast, may be absorbed by the skin and cause estrogen-like (hormonal) effects (3). Because estrogen has the ability to promote the growth of breast cancer cells, some scientists have suggested that the aluminum-based compounds in antiperspirants may contribute to the development of breast cancer.|`|D0pQFlMIaa	It hasn't been proven at all, but I think it's a legitimate idea at least. Deoderant (specifically antiperspirant type) stops you from sweating as much as you normally would. The idea is that the sweat glands get blocked from releasing stuff they should, which could potentially have some kind of impact leaving toxins inside near the area close to the breast. This is what I heard anyway. But yeah, pretty much everything it seems could have a link to cancer, so who knows. If you're concerned, try getting deoderant without antiperspirant, or every once in a while skip the deoderant for a day or two if you can.|`|9GXSpe3aaa	Lol , my Dad is completely convinced and now boycotts deodorant .. My mom is sure that he's just a freak who listened to some chain e-mail about it a few years back . I dont think it makes sense .  Supposedly, they found compounds similar to or some of the same found in deodorant in tissue which had breast cancer .. so it was present but doesn't necessarily mean it caused it . If i'm standinq next to the kid who pulls the fire alarm , it doesn't mean I did it .|`|AA11896801	Deodorant may not be proven to cause cancer, but it is full of chemicals.  Why is it necessary to use deodorant if you wash twice a day?|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	Its a myth, aluminum chloride does NOT cause cancer.|`|Vtcu0MV9aa	no this is just a myth I Always use underarm deodorant but prefer spray on :L xx|`|JafmNha5aa	To paraphrase an old saying, if it sounds too bad to be true, it probably is(not true).|`|XGfI0zwcaa	<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/risk/ap-deo" rel="nofollow">http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/facts...</a>|`|xxSGhywoaa	It's not the deodorant, it's the anti perspirant.  I think it has to do with the aluminum.  Which is not in "just plain" deodorant.  Toms of Maine and Crystals is the number one's and most used deodorants from a pharmacy.  However, most 'deodorant' producers, make one without the aluminum in them thus removing the anti-perspirant.  So when purchasing (and you have this fear) just choose your deodorant, that has DEODORANT.  not DEODORANT/ANTi-PERSPIRANT.  <br>  Then of course you could think of it this way,  Milk, Laundry Detergent, Chlorine, Meat, Fruits all of these at one time were said to have been associated in causing cancer.|`|7ES4xMloaa	look at a newspaper EVERYTHING gives you cancer|`|7HKTDcvYaa	There are many carcinogens in our industrial environment which have been shown to cause cancer under certain conditions, but which can not be shown to cause specific cancers in a predictable way when dosage is low.<br>  <br>  What could happen is of course that a large number of carcinogens from a large number of different chemicals might greatly increase risk of cancer without any one of them contributing enough to the outcome to be fingered as cause the way for instance smoking has been fingered.<br>  <br>  Many chemicals are known to increase the rate of growth of certain cancers while doing nothing to cause the cancer in the first case. So instead of a diagnosis at age 80 you get your diagnosis at 50. Similarly some are able to make metastasis occur more readily.  This does not increase the incidence of that cancer, but makes survival less likely.<br>  <br>  One can do whatever is reasonable to avoid carcinogens, avoid angiogenesis agents, and avoid chemicals that increase risk of metastasis. Or not.<br>  <br>  You might expose yourself more to risk of cancer by having CPVC plumbing where you have chlorine in your water, or using a carbon filter where you have chlorinated water. You can avoid those risk contributions or just stop trying to cut your risks.<br>  <br>  There are adequate antiperspirants that do not contribute to risk of cancer, so switching brands could be the best choice.|`|q9C46Wuqaa	Most everything can cause cancer.<br>  <br>  Scientist have even released some data to the FDA stating that everyone has cancer dormant in their bodies, all you need is one chemical to disrupt the cells to awaken the cancer.<br>  <br>  Did you know that freezing a bottle of water can release a harmful chemical that can cause stomach cancer?|`|HwxcAIwhaa	if that was true i would be so pissed...but it doesnt lol|`|PXfUyd5aaa	Haha, WHAT?!<br>  <br>  Yeah, okay, stop using deodorant then, see how that works out.

The guy would be a hero to too many and too famous to fire.  <br>  <br>  It is very hard to prove a negative by the way.

They use the ambiguity of the data and it complexity to hide behind.|`|84b16d97e7d42ff125bb26b44375be86aa	Probably not fired, just not able to get funding for their research.  It's a lot easier to justify funding in the harmful effects of CO2 (or harmful effects of anything) than just finding out if there's a problem or not.  <br>  <br>  A researcher can get funding to investigate whether a problem exists, but if (s)he discovers that there probably isn't a problem, then there is no justification for further research.|`|AsKWImpQaa	No, not at all. University professors that are tenured almost never get fired. Untenured faculty need to publish and bring in grant money to advance (among other things) to tenure, but research that showed global warming is not happening would still get funded, unless their research is shown to be in error.<br>  <br>  I think it's funny that people don't understand that most of government and industry would be overjoyed if global warming went away. The Bush administration tried for 8 years to suppress it, but they eventually had to at least partially give in because they would have looked dumb if they'd kept denying it.|`|7HKTDcvYaa	If the scientist has some degree of integrity it will not matter.<br>  After carefully checking methods, observations, conclusions to be sure that the conclusion is unavoidable, the scientist will publish these.  It is unlikely that anyone will fire if the work is faultless.<br>  <br>  However, if the conclusion is on the margin, supportable with appropriate interpretation of evidence, but barely, the conclusions would have to be expressed in terms of uncertainty rather than a weak conclusion that is hard to stand behind.|`|ywOqliwKaa	Probably at least lose his/her next raise.<br>  <br>  Although I see there are many skeptics from universities around the world.|`|AAJd6KsLaa	In a word no.  <br>  <br>  If you form a question you want to answer, look at what has been done to answer it, formulate testable hypothesis related to the question, set up a research methodology to test the hypothesis, get results, interpret them, recognize the strength and weakness of the research techniques used and the generalizeability from your data to your general research question from, present your research for evaluation to experts in the field, then you have evidence that your hypothesis is correct, or that the data doesn't support your hypothesis.  This is all you cal do.  <br>  <br>  Scientists already start with the assumption that global warming does not exist.  Not the assumption that it does.  Going through the scientific process, scientists have found evidence that supports the various hypothesis formulated to test if global warming is occurring.  Theories are formed from the relationships they have found investigating different aspects of factors they have determined are significantly indicators global warming.  <br>  <br>  If it is not significant, that needs to be published to.  It could help in future work and could alter the theories.|`|db77723b96fc01eeed3d85a8a58e79ecaa	Based solely on the fact that nothing of this nature has ever occurred, I'm going to say no, they wouldn't. And why on Earth would the university lose research funding for making a monumental discovery which disproves decades of scientific research? They would in all likelihood get *more* funding for doing that.<br>  <br>  Edit:  You guys must learn to read carefully and with understanding before responding. I said that no scientist has yet been fired from a university position for doing research showing that anthropogenic global warming isn't happening. Not that global warming has never happened before.|`|zince8g1aa	Funds would be needed for climate change studies regardless of causation.<br>  <br>  The U.S. government and fossil fuel industry, and high polluters also have a vested interest in wanting there to be no human impact, since mitigation efforts will arguably cost the U.S. and other developed nations disproportionately.  This is why we've seen numerous efforts from the Bush Administration and industry-funded think tanks to muzzle scientists and prop up the fringe.<br>  <br>  There are huge incentives to be a global warming denier.  In addition to normal funding (given they meet certain academic credentials - a big assumption), they can also receive funding from certain industries and ideological think tanks.  Global warming deniers, no matter how weak their academic background or argument is, achieve instant fame, end up on the Inhofe list, and are propped up around the blogosphere as brave heroes.  In contrast, most normal scientists quietly go about their business with little fanfare.|`|0TaFg8KGaa	Funding is of interest to the fundors. They will likely get a new funding source from the fossil fuel industry. It has happened before.|`|88vcImqiaa	No, otherwise there would be very few professors still holding their job.  Read what they are saying about GW.|`|1fee420808aabf67636dc09772eb45cfaa	No, that's silly, science thrives on challenging and revising theories.  Any scientist able to show that man-made global warming is not happening would probably win the Nobel prize, since they'd have shown something that no other scientist has been able to show.  That's not likely to happen, since there's a lot of evidence supporting the current theory, but let's hope for some glimmer of good news.<br>  <br>  In a recent court trial where auto manufacturers tried to show evidence against global warming, the best witness they could come up with was John Christy.   <br>  <br>  "While he now acknowledges that global warming is real and the human contribution is significant, Christy has been a long-time skeptic who previously argued that satellite climate data do not show a trend toward global warming, and even show cooling in some areas. His findings have been widely disputed." <br>  <a href="http://www.exxonsecrets.org/html/personfactsheet.php?id=903" rel="nofollow">http://www.exxonsecrets.org/html/personf...</a><br>  <br>  It was again established in court that even high profile skeptic John Christy believes that global warming is happening and it's primarily due to man-made causes.<br>  <br>  Isn't it interesting that you have to post your question as a hypothetical one... that there are no scientists who have research showing that man-made global warming is not happening?  What exactly do the energetic skeptics here on YA base their anti-science rants on?

A 20% drop in efficiency, and you've got to make these even cheaper to manufacture before they are cost-effective compared to hooking a transformer and rectifier to the power grid.<br>  The other issue that people tend to overlook is that converting the DC power from solar cells to AC requires rather expensive hardware. So unless you only need to feed DC, you have to add that cost in too. Conversely, the cost per mile of running residential-grade utility lines is somewhere around $40,000... lot of factors to consider.

RECYCLE: Recycling beverage containers is one of the easiest things people can do to live sustainably. Recycling conserves resources and saves energy. Think about this: A California family of four, on average, will consume more than 2,000 CRV beverage containers in one year, worth more than $100 in CRV. <br>  <br>  2. REUSE AND BUY RECYCLED: Californians can help reduce their carbon footprint by reusing a water bottle to eliminate waste. If residents purchased a water filtration system for their tap water instead of buying bottled water, they would reduce substantial energy and environmental costs. “Close the loop” on recycling by purchasing goods made from or packaged in recycled material. Products manufactured from recycled material often require less energy than using virgin resources, and lower consumption results in fewer greenhouse gas emissions. Today, there are thousands of manufacturers and retailers offering affordable products made from recycled bottles and cans and other materials. <br>  Visit www.greengiftguide.com. <br>  <br>  3. LEAVE YOUR CAR BEHIND: Leave your car at home at least one day a week. If you can cut your vehicle miles traveled by just 5% through combining trips, walking, biking, or taking public transportation, you can save up to $100 per year on gasoline costs. You can also reduce one pound of greenhouse gas emissions by eliminating just one mile of driving. <br>  <br>  4. CONSERVE ENERGY AT HOME: Get a jumpstart on those energy-efficient home improvements you've been putting off all year. Cut your monthly energy bills 30% by replacing old equipment in your home with state-of-the-art “Energy Star” products. Turn off lights when you leave a room and keep the thermostat at 70 degrees or lower in cold weather months, 78 degrees or higher in the warm weather months. You can save about 3% on heating costs for every degree you reduce your thermostat setting. Turn down your water heater or purchase an Energy Star water heater. Water heating accounts for about 13% of home energy costs. Contact your local energy company to receive an energy audit; most companies provide this service free of charge.<br>  <br>  5. CONSERVE AT WORK: Enable your monitor’s energy saving features when in use. Turn off your computer equipment at night and at other times when it doesn’t have to be left on. An LCD monitor consumes only 20-50% of the energy of a conventional CRT monitor. Want to do more? Be conservative about what documents you decide to print and change your printer settings to 2-sided printing to reduce the amount of paper you consume at the office. <br>  <br>  6. USE LESS WATER: Take shorter showers and install a showerhead adapter or low-flow showerhead. After heating and cooling, water heating is typically the largest energy user in the home because it is necessary for many activities. About 90% of the energy use in a clothes washer goes to water heating. Wash clothes in cold water and make an effort to reduce hot water usage and you will see the savings. <br>  <br>  7. GREEN YOUR CLEAN: Use non-VOC and non-toxic cleaning products, soaps, detergents and paints in the home. You will prevent harsh chemicals from entering the water supply and will improve your home’s air quality. <br>  <br>  8. UNPLUG IT: Unplug your cell phone charger, hair dryer, TV, lamps and other household electronics from the wall when you are not using them. Even if they are turned off, they still use Phantom Power, small amounts of energy that is used just by being plugged into the outlet. Invest in a “smart” power strip that automatically turns off your electronics when you are not using them.<br>  <br>  9. PLANT A TREE: A single tree will absorb one ton of carbon dioxide over its lifetime. Shade provided by trees can reduce your air conditioning bill by 10-15%. Consider growing fruit trees or plant a garden so that you can eat what you grow and avoid trips to the grocery store. Compost your table scraps to reduce landfill waste and help your garden thrive.<br>  <br>  10. REMEMBER TO RECYCLE YOUR BOTTLES AND CANS AT HOME, AT WORK, AND AT PLAY: Use your curbside bin or redeem your California Refund Value beverage containers for cash at a nearby recycling center. Enter your zip code in the DOC’s recycling center locator at www.bottlesandcans.com or call 1-800-RECYCLE to find a recycling center near you.

Many of the farms near my childhood home reap their corn later in the year, now, due to a drop in annual precipitation over the last 20 years.  No way to say if that's from global warming or normal variations in weather, but the effect's the same.
3NZV65alaa	I'm sorry but I have to agree with the first answerer and it is difficult to answer your question fully since it is difficult to decipher, but I will try.<br>  <br>  About AC's and refrigerators, there never has been a problem to solve since they have always been 'eco-friendly' in as much as  they operate in a completely closed system and simply move heat from one place to another and do not release any emissions themselves during their lifetime.<br>  The improvement in insulation over the years has made refrigerators more efficient than they probably were 50 years ago which would help reduce running costs, but there is no reason to try to change what is probably one of the most efficient appliances ever made.<br>  <br>  As far as cars are concerned, buy what you can afford. It is not going to change the climate even in the slightest way.<br>  A little education can go a long way for everyone.<br>  Fearing a myth does not happen with knowledge.<br>  <br>  BTW:<br>  It seems to me that you have some sort of a problem with engineers.<br>  Engineers have been the ones who have made all of the improvements for modern life. They are the problem solvers of this world which are educated and practical.<br>  Engineers are improving our lives every single day.<br>  The engineers have no control over market pricing and seldom get recognized for their contributions.<br>  <br>  Whishful thinking does not make things happen, action and hard work does.|`|4e1nRQCUaa	engineers do what their boss asks them to do.  <br>  ecofreindly ACs have been made for a long time, if you mean evaporative coolers.  Ecofriendly refrigerators are also made, but they are costly.<br>  Instead of whining, why don't you do something?|`|nyqoPvL2aa	If the solution to a problem was easy, it wouldn't really be a problem. There are a lot of things that add to the cost and weight of cars that are there to make them safer, it's a compromise. You could get incredibly good fuel mileage and low pollution per mile if you put a small engine onto a oversized skateboard... you'd also probably die before you made your first turn. In any case, why do you think there's something inherently wrong with being an engineer, if people want the products they design and build. If anything, you should be railing against the stupid rednecks who have to drive oversized pickup trucks just to buy a sixpack of beer... or rich bankers who drive oversized pickups because they think it makes them manlier.<br>  <br>  If you learn much about cars, or for that matter cooling systems, you'll find that they're a huge collection of compromises... this makes it impossible for them to function while only producing clean air and kittens from the tailpipe. Energy has to be spent.|`|1CgK5Le6aa	Woah. I hope English isn't your first language. If it isn't, you're forgiven. If it is, learn to type how you speak. This is unintelligible. One verb per sentence.<br>  <br>  Why aren't eco-friendly A/Cs and refrigerators made? Well, we have designed them the best we can. They take up energy. There is no free lunch in ecology or economics. The world isn't growing, we have to move what we have efficiently.<br>  <br>  I really don't understand the rest of that. Are you mad they make cars you can't afford? Or that everyone can pretty much afford some sort of car, and that fact is destroying the environment? They're not doing it "just to make the earth (more) worse" (worse is already a superlative, like better, you don't need "more"), they're doing it because people want it and they can. The environment is (sadly) a small concern in this equation.|`|uymZEWp6aa	it will be very costly and no 1 wants his loss,the engineers must b trying yaar they also r living on this mother earth only.<br>  the demand is of stylish car,just think wat do u want to travel in a rickshaw or a luxury ac car.........think<br>  most of the ozone layer gets depleted by the acs and fridges only as their co2 gases and cfc's are the major reason and how can a enemy luv u or care 4 u
