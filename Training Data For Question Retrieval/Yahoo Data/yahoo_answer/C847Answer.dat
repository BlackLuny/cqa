Y2rLd85Paa	If you call your bank, now a days, as everyone is at their throat trying to make ends meet, you can ask them to do a Loan Modification.  Loan Modification can happen in on e or two ways. They can lower interests rate at about 1% or 3% more or less. Or, they can reduce what you owe, matching the CURRENT value of your home, luckily the value of the properties has gone down.   But this is not just one call to the bank , and its done. NO, you have to call them everyday, every hour be consistent, be specific. Like if they would have been calling you as a collection, you have to do the same.  The bank will ask you to show why you need them to reduce it, like taxes, lost of job, etc.   Good Luck.|`|ssK4oJi9aa	you mean "principal" as in capital gains and losses. only realized capital gains and losses may be declared and to realize it you have to sell the house.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	I did for my father, but they reduced his interest rate as well.    I did a loan modification.   I had to supply with an appraisal, his income documentation and an expense declaration.    It took me about 5 weeks though, it was not a quick process.|`|ak3NBmINaa	Yes, indeed! I was fortunate enough to pay off my mortgage in 10 years. Took a lot of sacrifice, too.    Now, if you mean does the bank refinance your loan to a new principal amount, and walk away from the current loan? Why would they do that?
NwkZ5OmCaa	You buy the software.  Install the software.  Do your tax return.  Print it, sign it, mail it.|`|tw44fqCpaa	If you are doing 2007 then contact turbo tax to request a download of a past years version (for a fee of course).  Then you have to mail in the return.  Prior years can't be efiled.|`|SpIlb43Uaa	Are you sure you mean 2007, that would be from a year ago. This current tax year for filing is 2008. But if you need to do a past year such as 2007, I do not know if it is possible to buy the 2007 Turbo program unless you contact them directly. I use Turbo program, you get one free e-file for federal taxes, state cost 19.95. Or you can print them up and mail them in.
NwkZ5OmCaa	You are jumping the gun.    The 1099-A has 3 fields on it.    the cancelled debt, the fmv and the yes/no for personally liable.    The 1099-A represents the "sale" of your property (which $-figure you use depends on the yes/no field).  Since you paid for the property, you gain/loss is after you subtract the purchase price.  If this is a gain and your main home for 2 years, you can exclude up to $250K of gain.  If it's a loss, you can't deduct it.    The real concern is if the box says yes and you have cancelled debt income (the difference between the debt and the fmv).  But you don't worry about that until you have the 1099-C.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	if it were your primary residence for 2 yrs. and you haven't used the exclusion in the past five yrs. you can exclude up to 500,000.00 from a MFJ return for the sale of a primary residence.|`|RwRCwJXMaa	This is something you should have addressed when you forclosed now you are stuck with this debt and all you can do at this point is set up a payment plan with the IRS... good luck
XHhJ8ffRaa	DO NOT wait until next year. What you need to do is to file an amended tax return. If you have already paid your taxes or gotten your refund back from the IRS, then you need to go ahead and file the amended return by filling out 1040X. You'll need to mail it in to the IRS. If you have not gotten your refund yet, wait until after you received your refund to file 1040X.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	You need to file an amended return, and include the newly found W-2.|`|0JoWTQWoaa	You will have to file an amended return.

If she was born on Jan 1, you would have to wait until next year to claim as a dependent.|`|5ta5yyWSaa	Claim her for '08 as a dependent. For other questions, go to irs.gov as you will never get a live person.|`|fQ5KYnqgaa	No you do not have to wait, you can claim her now|`|AA10987701	www.irs.gov for the answers to any of your questions.  They have instructions that you can download to help you file your income taxes.  You can look into child care credits, and low income credits if applicable, and you will get money back if you made over $3,000 last year for yourself and your children from the federal government which is part of the stimulous program.  You will get about $600 for yourself, and $300 for each child and you need the child's social security number (if you don't have one, apply immediately) in order to receive the money back from the fed's.    Many states also have a homestead or rent rebate program, and you may qualify based on your circumstances, and your state senator's office could tell you if they have such programs which help the taxpayer based on income.    Any child born in any year may be claimed as a dependent regardless of age.    Look into the education accounts, called Cardell and most banks/credit unions have tons of information on how to set them up and you have until April 15 of the following year to fund the account so this year counts for your to put money away into that account for your child.  You don't have to pay income taxes on the money that is put into the education account, so it's a great savings account for you and your child.    If you have any questions, just send an email through this site and I'll try to answer.  If I don't have the answer, I'll try to research it for your from the www.irs.gov website, since I'm a retired Certified Public Accountant.  Believe me, you need every tax credit, and rebate given from the federal government in order to raise a child.

Make sure you keep those forms you received in the mail for filing your return.
E2h4QuxKaa	Check the late fee policy, pet policy...and repairs.  Make sure you take pictures of every room in the house/apartment and document any damages.  This will help if your landlord tries to take your security deposit when you move out and he says you have caused damages that were there when you moved in.  Check to see if he needs your permission before entering while you aren't home.  Check the maintenance guidelines for repairs and what you are responsible for.

Edit:  Your HSA contributions are not made with pre-tax dollars so all the boxes should be the same and you report your contriubtions on Form 8889.  Your employers contribution will be listed as a code W in box 12.  You will get a form 5498 from the trustee of the HSA account listing the years contributions.
0JoWTQWoaa	No. The government will only take refunds when the loan is in default.  Since you were very smart and applied for a forbearance instead of not paying the loans, your refund will not be taken.|`|pqSEIgVbaa	No not if you are on forebearance.

838bf62c54d3b8485e9f70388fa64a81aa	I just got a letter from Citi raising my American AAdvantage MC to 19.99% APR on purchases. It's Prime plus 13.99, 19.99 minimum. Ridiculous!    My plan is to eventually close the account, after paying off the balance w/ a 2.9% balance xfer rate until paid in full. I'm done spending $60/yr to earn airline mileage that I can't use.    Considering how tight your situation appears to be, it's hard to suggest opening an account at another bank, balance transferring from your Citi cards, then closing your Citi cards. If you still have a decent credit rating, it could help forestall having to fork over more money in bank charges.    Citi is in dire straits. Jacking up the rates across the board is one of their strategies to stay afloat, despite promising a lot of accountholders that their fixed rates would stay fixed forever. Hard to make a principled stand when you're taking on water, though.|`|Oi8knF6Saa	I seen a new program on that the other day. they said on it that credit card like citi and american express are going up on interest due to where you shop. I know it suck. you pay the bill on time and still it goes up. you can try transfering it to a new card with o% for a year and go from there good luck|`|hggAFCCIaa	you need to go back to your original contract w/ them.  the original terms and conditions on these cards.  call them and ask WHY they raised the rates.  make sure these reasons are compliant with the original terms and conditions.  if not, raise cane!  if so, you might want to look into tranferring your balances to another card.  there are many out there that offer 0% on transferred balances; however, be certain to read the fine print as this is usually just an intro rate and will sometimes go up really high if not paid off after a certain amount of time.  either way...i'd definitely start shopping elsewhere.  that does not sound like the type of people i want to do business with!
tYDEIw8qaa	First thing you need to do is find somebody to exchange with. The easiest way to do this is by using council house exchange sites such as www.underoneroofexchange.co.uk     Once you've found an exchange you need to get a form from your landlord, fill it in and send it back. Your council then have 42 days in which to approve or deny the exchange. Do not just move, you're likely to lose your home if you do that.    Go to the source below for full details|`|ZEwAalKPaa	The exchange has to be approved by your council and the other parties' before you can get down to the details of how and when you will physically exchange.

First you have to be served a 5 day notice, and then after that you have to be served an eviction notice with a court date.  When you go to court, the judge has to rule you be evicted and they usually give you 2-4 weeks before BY LAW your landlord can come into your apartment and remove your things.  Call the cops if he's harrassing you, he'll get in trouble because his dumb assssss as a landlord should know the processes.|`|49740c9daeea677fc86801fb2b3f41deaa	Either pay the rent or tell him to go ahead and start the court procedings for an eviction.   As you have refused rent he can sue you for an unlawful detainer.|`|XowM9e7Naa	All these verbal communications carry no legal weight.  The landlord has the right to give you a three day notice (five days in most states) to pay or move.  The notice must be in writing.  He also has the right to give you a 14 day notice to move (to pay and move).  Your original notice that you were moving must be a written notice to be a legal notice.  In my state, if the tenant does  not move by the date stated in the notice, and the landlord must start an eviction action, the landlord has the right to collect the costs of the court action plus double rent from the move date stated in the notice until the sheriff physically removes them from the premises.  I think your landlord is foolish.  You have been there six years.  If you were my tenant I would trust you, because it is not practical to get in a fight with a tenant who is moving anyway.  Play it cool, he probably had a temper blow up, and it may blow over.|`|fa49fc3460e0c0dfb37b6cda6aa1dd56aa	1.  Your notice to leave on Feb. 28th is not valid unless it is in writing.   Since it's now Feb. 2...you are legally responsible for Feb. & Mar. rent.    2.  Being two weeks late is a long time.  He can issue you a 3 day notice to vacate after being only 1 day late.  That is the first step in the eviction process.    3.  PA courts have streamlined there eviction process to prevent owners from losing their homes.  If your landlord is savy, he can have you removed by the sheriff in as little as 2 weeks.    4.  If you do force the eviction...expect to have a judgment against you for much more than this months rent.|`|Y2rLd85Paa	Well, since you are on a month to month basis contract. each 1st of the month you enter a new contract, so it was nice of you on letting him know.  So until February 28th the apartment is yours. But even though you are moving 2 days before, you still have to pay the whole month. So you can stay until the 26 or 28th it make nos difference.   Now, on the late rent, he can he mad about that, cause also as per contract the rent is due on X day of the month or within 5 days. But, If he wants he can start a process of eviction, which he will still have to pay for it, and its not worth is. So I think that the law its on your side on this one.    Good Luck    PS: just to make sure, if he gets int he way, make sure you start packing.    PS 2: ALso, he is lucky, because now a days 99% of the time, the tenants are not paying the last month and leaving with no money for the landlord.
cwKNDZz9aa	You need to amend your 2007 tax returns and file married, joint. The parents will have to amend their return. Don't fret about any audit. It's a very common mistake.     Because of the issues, you could end up in IRS computer hell for a while until they process everything through in the right order. Be prepared. If there is an IRS office near you, you may have better luck walking in when you get the letters from Mr. BIG COMPUTER.     Be very careful with the amended return. You are combining 2 returns into 1. You need to be clear and precise so the IRS "gets it."    Once you file your amended returns, the IRS computers will, eventually, kick out the parent's return as being in error and will attempt to "correct" it automatically if they don't file their own amended returns. Some times, the computers actually get it right.     Take in copies of your amended returns to your financial aid office as soon as they are filed. That should straighten out the financial aid picture.     Good luck. It may be a long and frustrating process but be patient, take each step as it comes, and it will work out.|`|NwkZ5OmCaa	Yes, you have to refile.    If you shared even a single night with your husband from 7/1 to 12/31 of 2007, you lied when you filed HOH.  Your only valid filing status would have been as MFS.  Same for your husband.    Of course your financial aid application is in chaos.  FAFSA enforces the rules and they darn well know what you did was illegal.      You have 2 choices.  1.  You refile as MFS and pay BACK the excess refund and EIC that you claimed.  Your husband refiles as single (possible not owing any more).  Your return will be reviewed by the IRS and you will probably get a letter saying you can't claim EIC for the next 2 years.    Or,    2.  You refile the HOH return as MFJ (you don't refile your husband's as the 1040X process will zero his out).  You pay back any excess refund and EIC.  Since marriage trumps dependency, your inlaws MUST amend their return to remove his exemption and pay back any tax they owe.    The late taxes for all of you will incur penalties and interest.|`|XowM9e7Naa	Yes you should file an amended return.   Do not do it yourself.  Go to a tax preparer for help.  There are many places where you can get free help in preparing returns if you can not afford to pay.  The IRS may offer help.  Do not be afraid to ask IRS for help.  You made an honest mistake.

ZeDjn4cVaa	No, you cannot claim education benefits if the costs of schooling are being paid for by grants.  If you are paying for it with loans, then you can claim the benefits.    If your child (a full-time degree student) is having her tuition, room, meals and books paid for by the federal grant, then your child must report as taxable income the amount of the grant that exceeds the money spent on tuition, fees, book, and necessary course supplies.  This mean that the amount of the grant  that pays for room and meals is taxable income to your daughter.  This "scholarship income" is combined with her other income to determine her filing requirement and taxable income.  So she may have some taxes to pay on the scholarship income depending upon the circumstances.

After that you have lets say 2,000 left, minus your move in cost which will probably be 1 months rent. You are left with roughly 1,200 to get food and pay for your basics like cable, electricity.    After all these initial payments and your furniture you will have a little bit left, but remember you have both good paying jobs so your checks should be able to cover for rent and your utility bills.    When I first moved out, I left with about 3,000 thats it. I managed to do it on only 1 income, you guys can.|`|MjfQETUoaa	That is way more than enough money. My boyfriend and I moved into an apartment over a year ago and all we had was the downpayment and first months rent which equaled to $2700. The electric service activation was $100 and we had the cable installed for like $60. We bought our dining table from WalMart for $215 and furniture for my daughters room for about $1,000 at sears. Your rent is waay cheap. In Hawaii we pay $1,350 for a 2 bedroom apartment and that is the reasonable side of town. Ghetto would be $900. Higher end would be $2,000 and up. Since you don't have any kids you will be fine with $15,000|`|ktGPcQxQaa	Im 22 and moved out on my own when I was 18. I got lucky and found a place where the utilities were included. If you can do this, go for it. But after 2 yrs, my boyfriend and I decided to relocate. Some of the expenses we came across was:  1. First and last month rent  2. Security Deposit  3. Water deposit  4. Electric deposit  5. Cable, internet, phone bill-these usually all have a connection fee, some places will bill the connection fee with your first bill, others want the payment upfront.  6. Furniture, decorations, dishware.......  7. Food,shampoo, toiletry,  moving expenses.    All in all its really hard to judge the amount you will need, but 10,000 should set a comfort net.|`|io02oHFbaa	$15,000 should be enough, just make sure you save an extra 2-5 grand should something come up.

BMKVb7hhaa	Lo spread  la differenza fra il tasso che ti viene applicato ed il parametro di riferimento, tipicamente l'Euribor 6 mesi. Quando il tasso di riferimento (stabilito da BCE) sale, lo stesso fanno i parametri di riferimento, e la banca ti aggiorna il tasso che vai a pagare sul mutuo (lo spread rimane sempre uguale ed  quello fissato quando hai contratto il mutuo). Il fatto che te lo possano ridurre dipende da quanto alto era inizialmente, dai rapporti che hai con la banca, dalla buona volont del direttore, e da fattori del tutto casuali (era buono il caff che il direttore ha bevuto stamattina? Sua moglie gliel'ha data? eccetera...) Permettimi qualche battuta, per la gioia di Alvaro :)    Per via dei tassi, secondo me siamo vicini ai massimi... forse saliranno ancora 1/4 di punto, ma poi dovrebbero stabilizzarsi ed eventualmente scendere. Rinegoziarlo adesso, per passare ad un fisso, che ti costerebbe cmq di pi, non credo sia una buona idea. Ovvio che il futuro lo conosce solo Merlino, e forse manco lui....     L'idea di vedere se puoi farti ridurre lo spread non  malvagia, sempre che dei margini di manovra ci siano, e non  del tutto da trascurare l'idea di informarti sulla possibilit di trasferire il mutuo presso un'altro Istituto di Credito (ce ne sono alcuni che fanno offerte vantaggiose in questo senso, ovviamente bisogna vedere com' il tuo mutuo e con che banca l'hai fatto). Un'ultima possibilit, se la rata ti pesa troppo,  quella di allungare il periodo di ammortamento, riducendo la rata.  Ciao :)|`|GsD2V6coaa	lo spread in pratica  il guadagno della banca!  ed  l'unica cosa che la tua banca pu far abbassare!!!!in pi c' l'euribor ma quello viene dato dalla banca europea ed  uguale per tutti    ps   io ti consiglio di lasciarlo cos com'|`|uGwpqdQFaa	Se vuoi stare tranquillo devi rinegoziare il mutuo e passare al tasso fisso visto che ora stanno toccando anche quello per metterlo circa al tasso dell'euribor + qualcosa di ricarico.|`|3GeaiANvaa	un tasso di interesse  composto da un tasso di riferimento e dallo spread applicato su questo tasso di riferimento. Il tasso di riferimento  tipicamente l'Euribor a 6 mesi, che in parole povere pu essere definito come il tasso a cui le banche tra di loro si prestano i soldi. Su questo tasso di riferimento (che  variabile nel tempo) la banca, al momento in cui hai acceso il mutuo, ti ha detto che avrebbe applicato uno spread, che si definisce in punti base, ovvero in centesimi di punto percentuale.   Esempio: se l'Euribor a 6 mesi oggi  il 4% e il tuo contratto di mutuo prevede uno spread di 200 punti base (ovvero del 2%) ora tu hai un tasso del 6%. Se domani l'Euribor a 6 mesi scende al 3%, il tuo spread rimane sempre del 2% e quindi avrai un tasso di interesse del 5%.  Se fossi in te rinegozierei il mutuo trasformandolo in fisso. Un tasso fisso ragionevole per i tempi che corrono pu essere intorno al 5,9%.|`|5656d519427424f1464795c7d7075787aa	iop non so dirti cosa sia lo spreed, so solo che nella mia vita di mutui ne ho fatti diversi, ed ho sempre scelto il tasso fisso.  anche se all'inizio  sempre un pochino pi caro, poi con l'andare del tempo si rivela il pi conveniente, infatto non ho mai visto i tassi diminuire, ma sempre andare all'ins  Ciao|`|bExVkpVJaa	scusa se te lo chiedo: non per far polemica, ma quando hai firmato il contratto di mutuo alla lettura dell'articolo riguardante il regolamento degli interessi non ti  sorta la curiosit di chiederlo? Comunque, lo spread rappresenta il margine di intermediazione applicato dalla banca per la concessione del mutuo e viene aggiunto ad ad un parametro di riferimento che di solito  l'euribor. Lo spread rimane fisso per tutta la durata del mutuo mentre il parametro di riferimento  variabile. Per modificare lo spread devi rinegoziare le condizioni finanziarie del mutuo e, per farla breve, laddove la banca sia disposta, a stipulare un nuovo contratto di mutuo.  Anche la trasformazione in fisso, se non espressamente previsto nel contratto di mutuo, rappresenta una rinegoziazione delle condizioni finanziarie. La convenienza di trasformarlo in fisso dipende: sono venute meno le condizioni che ti fecero scegliere un variabile?|`|e1sL9a8eaa	i tassi saliranno ancora, o almeno la Banca Europea continua ad affermarlo (ancora ieri, indicando per ora un aumento il 9 settembre).    ma il problema  che i mutui sono legati all'Euribor, non al tasso di sconto. L'Euribor, che la Banca Europea non controlla direttamente,  salito gi al 4,50% circa dopo le tempeste di borsa di ferragosto, il che vuol dire che la rata di settembre sar maggiore di quella di agosto (+/-)...    L'andamento dell'Euribor si puo controllare anche qui:   http://www.telemutuo.it/euribor-aggiorna...|`|f22b3033edaff8e5a2fac6289399b9fbaa	poi ti rispondo ma prima voglio vedere un po' di risposte degli altri. cos, curiosit personale.      ok.... mi basta cos.  Quello che ti hanno gi detto gli altri sullo spread  corretto. Non aggiungo altro.   Sarei per curioso di sapere con quale banca hai il mutuo perch io non ho mai sentito di nessuna banca che da risposte del genere. La determinazione del tasso di un mutuo si fa con l'atto di mutuo. cio davanti ad un notaio. Io giuro che non ho mai sentito che ti abbassano lo spread in base ad una tua letterina. Per me alla fine ti mandano una bella comunicazione scritta dove ti dicono che non  modificabile lo spread e che al massimo ti possono proporre una nuova operazione, a certe coondizioni etc etc che poi di fatto significa andare davanti a un notaio per l'ennesima volta e pagare una parcella.   La rinegoziazione dle mutuo ad oggi non  fatta da nessuna banca, cos come la portabilit.   Okkio, informati bene. Non mi sembra una risposta seria quella che ti ha dato la tua banca.

43e1a4f72e6ac281024faa8670193271aa	Ciao Joe.    Allora, dalla tua domanda non si capisce se la casa  la tua abitazione principale (cio la casa in cui hai la residenza anagrafica) oppure no.     Di norma le cantine sono considerate pertinenze dell'abitazione principale. Per siccome l'Ici  un'imposta che varia da comune a comune dovresti controllare la delibera Ici del tuo comune (del comune in cui si trova la cantina); questo perch alcuni comuni hanno delle restrizioni per quanto riguarda le pertinenze.     Comunque di norma le categorie catastali c2, c6 e c7 possono essere considerate pertinenze. Per il calcolo devi vedere quale aliquota  prevista dal tuo comune per l'abitazione principale e per la pertinenza.     Il calcolo  questo: rendita catastale x 1,05 x 100 x aliquota ici  Se l'aliquota della pertinenza  uguale ha quella prevista per l'abitazione principale allora le puoi sommare.    La dichiarazione Ici non si compila per pagare l'Ici. La devi compilare solo se hai aquistato l'immobile l'anno scorso. (A meno che il tuo comune non preveda una gestione diversa, ma anche quello risulta dalla delibera). La compilazione  semplice: devi considerare la casa e la pertinenza come due unit distinte, quindi devi compilare due riquadri, indicando i mesi di possesso nel 2006 di ciascuna delle unit abitative.  Ti ricordo che se nella casa non ci hai preso la residenza subito, il periodo che  passato dalla data di acquisto alla data in cui hai preso la residenza deve essere indicato. Quindi dovrai compilare 4 riquadri anzich 2.     Se la casa NON  la tua abitazione principale allora scrivilo e ti dir come fare.    Ciao|`|JtOuJj1aaa	la cantina  considerata pertinenza  dovresti avere due fogli catastali separati da cui desumere i dati        6 - Le pertinenze dell'abitazione principale   Dal 1 gennaio 2001 alle pertinenze deve essere riservato lo stesso trattamento fiscale dell'abitazione principale, indipendentemente dal fatto che il Comune abbia o meno deliberato l'estensione della riduzione dell'aliquota anche alle pertinenze.    Riguardo poi all'ammontare della detrazione stabilita dal Comune per l'unit immobiliare adibita ad abitazione principale, occorre ricordare che se detto ammontare non trova totale capienza nell'imposta dovuta per l'abitazione principale deve essere computato, per la parte residua, sull'imposta dovuta per le pertinenze.

Si a un ni?o le das dinero para que se compre el almuerzo o merienda, automticamente se lo guarda para comprar productos que debera tener en momentos puntuales o ganarse con su esfuerzo con la prctica de buenos hbitos.

7xrhLzsqaa	You may think about calling the police or the property manager to at least start the process of documenting everything.  You must document everything to protect yourself.  You may want to see if there is another condo in the same complex that is for rent.  Nothing is worth dealing with neighbors like that and it seems they won't be going anywhere anytime soon.    The police is probably your best bet.  Calling the property manager can be useful (just to have it on record), but they really can't get involved in neighbor disputes.|`|tdiyhf68aa	dont know how good you are at being chicken-sh*t, but its time to set them up, and have the mgr. stop by to see the truth.....or move..........|`|99751713963141b5c9d63532401d65cfaa	Yahoo can't help you with this, but the local authorities can.

You need to go to law school for that.  Often, a person in the paralegal field will become motivated when working around attorneys, and they will go back to school and get licensed.  It's a personal choice.    I have heard of paralegals making $70,000 - $100,000 or more working for the right law firm.  It all depends on the individual.

You can wait for the letter, or she can call the apartment complex and ask for the screening company they use and call the company to get a report on herself.  Most apartment complexes are pretty savy when it comes to laws on discrimination, only because there is a hefty fine if one does discriminate.

On the other hand... if you were willing to do a little work, then you'd only need 700 in 10 weeks. That's 70 a week or 10 dollars a day. There are plenty of things you can do if you were willing to do about 10-15 hours of work each week. Go down to some of the Mom & Pop stores down on your nearest main street, explain your situation and ask them if you can do anything to help out for the next few months off the books.    Your mom is only pitching $200 because she's trying to teach you a lesson (and a valuable one). If you want something good in life, you have to work for it.    Secondly... your mom already sounds like a reasonable person from what you've told us (my mom would have laughed if I suggested what you are at your age). I'm sure if you put out the effort and come say $100 short of your goal... she'll throw in the extra $100.

e293f725c6c054a608ceccfc8d0dd041aa	Car loans do not work the same as house loans. all of the interest on car loans is paid at front end of the contract, What this amounts to is if you want to pay additional principle payments and do so in the first couple of years of the contract you will likely see the total amount you pay reduced, I'm not familiar with a car loan that would see a reduced payment amount. More likely you will see theee contract time shortened. Additionally, if you carry the contract out through the 3rd 4th and into the 5th year year is little benefit at that point of paying the loan off early. To verify this simply call the bank and ask for a pay off amount. In the beginning it will be way less and toward the end it wont be much different.|`|1f503857f41d68124da4cbcc503306b9aa	wow the last two answer are great. there is really no benifit to paying extra payments. call your finance company and ask them.    ex-manager of a car dealership|`|46708506191773125e3949d745db17b7aa	it will get paid off sooner and you will pay less interest|`|8f9847f89a58929aaeab83b5cb9d8bcdaa	I can't really say because I (we) don't know the type of contract you have.     However, most automobile contracts are precomputedd interest which means they are not based on simple interest.    If so, you do not save any interest until, and unless and until you pay the account in full. What you do gain is the right to miss or skip a future payment for each full months payments made in advance.    Therefore, advance payments don't make much sense.      If your contract is on 'simple' interest, then you save money (interest) on every dollar paid in advance, because your balance is lower.    However, you can't skip future payments as you can if it's precompute. On simple interest loans, advance payment are not considered payments, but balance reductions.     Confused?
AA10210669	I don't like Graphics Gal.  Sorry.  It sounds condescending to yourslf.    I'd stay away from anything that is too cute or people won't take you seriously.  Graphic design can be a male-dominated business in many parts of the country, so make the name something gender neutral so you won't be immediately eliminated by any chauvinists.     Some places to start:  your initials, a pet's name that's not too cutesy, something out-there like "Area 51 Design".  Check out graffiti in your town for non-profane street names.  How about going to www.Dictionary.com and look up the words graphic and design in the thesaurus and see what related words you can come up with?    I think you can have some fun with it and find a name that will allow you to be taken seriously as the professional that you are.  And you have to be able to say it easily when you answer the phone!  :o)    Best wishes!!|`|9da4d70041b61bade51eb02559d7d038aa	A-Ha Graphics? Silly no?

Si son inmobilirias srias no lo s.     Lo que te puedo decir es que la mayoria me pedian el nmero de la tarjeta de crdito con la contrase?a, para garantizar la reserva. Por supuesto que les di, eso me parecio de mucho mal gusto o de mala fe.  Espero que alguien de Buenos Aires te pueda ayudar ms que yo.

1203d31ab3bc3d0447a306d55a7bde5faa	Check with the post office to find out what your landlord's responsibility is.  A person I know had this problem, and unfortuantely, the post office wasn't willing to do much.  I suggest getting a box at the nearest post office - it's much more secure than one that's being tampered with regularly.  They're usually not much at all - you can get a 3" x 5.5" box for $37 (or less, depending on your fee group) for six months.  Don't worry if you receive stuff bigger than that - they will hold it for you.|`|b138671ae3255ea398ff2f873fbf25e8aa	They should fix it! There r companies that do this for apts. and the apt. pays them to repair the mailboxes. I would send the office a certified letter requesting repairs and also I would request my money refunded or deducted from my rent for the po box, u have the right to a mail box!!! Also send a letter to the post master as well. UR property may want to look into installing a security camera this is a great way to stop this, also call the police or request the office do so, usually they will ck. a area that has a crime they r aware of. Good luck and this is just my opinion, but I would look for a new place when ur lease is up, reason they dont seem to care and give poor service to residents.

As to costs for such representations it's whatever the agent and the principal strike. The usual method is that the agent is compensated by the seller's broker when the transaction closes but some seller's agents will not share their commissions with a buyer's agent because it is not in the best interest of their fiduciary client the seller. You can always tell the buyer's agent that they are to be paid by convincing the seller's agent to split their commission versus that so called "success fee"  Your call  Buena Suerte|`|AA11864592	There is no set rules on how an agent gets paid.

However, there are no set rules on how this works.  A few buyers agents are under the impression that they can represent the buyer better because it is actually the buyer and not the seller paying them.  I think this logic is off base.  A good Realtor will look after the best interests of their buyers no matter how they are paid.  Also, some buyers agents have spent many hours with costumers who end up using another Realtor or don't use them at all.  All their hard work and time ends up making them no money, so they seek to receive some money upfront to show that you are a serious buyer.  What they are doing isn't wrong, it's just a different way to operate.  I would personally do what you feel is best.  There are plenty of ethical Realtors out there that will not charge you for buyers agency services and are paid buy the seller.

Know everything you can about the company that you are interviewing with and make references to particular projects the company has done, charity work supported by the company.   Know and be able to explain why you want to be part of the company. Know what contribution that you can make.   Look good, wear appropriate clothing to an interview.   The most important things: Be on time, fifteen minutes early is on time! and on your resume' and application do not misspell anything. I automatically dismiss any application that I cannot read or where words are misspelled.   Remember that you are there to make the company better, you are there to support them not the other way around.

Most businesses involved with engineering will be very proffesional so business attire is very neccesary when going to the interview. No facial hair, over-bearing cologne, etc. Just remeber that you are interviewing with another human being across the table from you. Yes, he may be the one making the decision as to whether you get the job or not, but let's face it he's not a robot. Above all, be honest. If you don't know something they are reqioring you to know for the position, admit it in the interview.

(Existem outros testes l)     NUNCA fa?a capitaliza??o !!!  uma grande roubada , pois seu dinheiro fica preso 2 ou 5 anos (depende do banco) , vc n?o pode mexer no dinheiro antes disso , mas caso precise , perde at 60% do dinheiro. N?o rende nada, somente a TR.   ------   Voc j est come?ando certo , que  se informar como poupar.   Atualmente esque?a a poupan?a, pois paga pouco (mesmo n?o descontando Importo de Renda)  melhor parar IR (Importo de Renda) e ter um lucro melhor.   ----------   Aprenda a seguinte palavra: JUROS COMPOSTOS.  mgico.

(Claro que R$ 1.000.000,00 em 10 anos n?o tem o mesmo poder de compra do que hoje, mas com o tempo vc pode aumentar a aplica??o mensal) .   ----------   Hoje em dia quem est come?ando com pouco dinheiro ,  indicado fundos de Renda Fixa (rende mais , s que existe um risco maior), mas caso n?o queira NENHUM risco, aplique em fundos DI. timo para quem come?a.   Dependendo do valor que vc aplica , essas recomenda??es podem mudar.   Dependendo do valor , a??es podem valer muito , mas caso n?o tenha experincia nesse ramo , esque?a ... pode proporcionalmente PERDER muito.   ------------   A melhor forma de juntar dinheiro  , assim que vc receber , determina uma porcentagem do seu salrio (30% por exemplo) e guardar no mesmo dia.   No banco , vc pode determinar uma data e pedir para fazer aplica??o automtica. N?o cobra nada por isso ! Se cobrar , troque de banco. Fuja de fundos de previdncia para quem n?o tem aporte inicial grande , n?o  vantagem , pois eles n?o falam , mas na hora que vc coloca dinheiro l , eles descontam 5% para poder aplicar o dinheiro (que  a comiss?o dos corretores, que n?o s?o funcionrios do Bradesco , mas sim uma agencia corretora anonima).   ----------   Sua pergunta est muito vaga , e tentei responder da melhor forma possivel.

SPU9rrbhaa	It's really about what is going to truly make you happy.  Money isn't everything.  I have left good paying jobs before because they made me miserable in my personal life/home life. I don't regret it one bit.  However, if you feel a worthwhile opportunity is worth staying for.... try it out, and see how you like it.  Home will always be there when you decide to go back.  Weigh your options carefully, no use going back home and resenting your friends/family for giving up a career opportunity.  Whatever you do, make a decision and don't doubt it!  Best of luck to you!|`|Qt9Wsuz8aa	Every fiber of your being?  Move.  Done.  No question.|`|AA11313325	Well what I would do is stay there for a while, till I got squared off money wise and job wise.

(Note: if you plan on using an acid stain, DO NOT clean with muriatic acid, since this will make acid staining impossible).     Rinse and dry.     Apply sodium hydroxide (10% solution) to neutralize remaining acid.     Rinse and dry.     Ready for your choice of floor treatment.     Recommend a urethane sealant first, to prevent moisture absorbed in concrete from coming up under the coating you finish with.
becca6b74554ef6c2de97477686169b0aa	Dome homes are generally much easier to maintain than most "conventional" structures. The reason being is that the domes require less roofing to enclose the same amount of square footage as a retangular structure and the roofing is subjected to much less stress from prolonged heat. The entire roof is never exposed to direct sunlight at the same time, therefore, the sun will "move across" the dome allowing the triangles to cool off as it does...thus preventing as much heat buildup as is prevelant in a flat or panel pitched roof. Also, the lack of an attic space greatly cuts down on convection heating of the exterior of the roof and the interior of the dome itself....not to mention that you get more useable space inside the home. The exterior walls are also easier to maintain because they are generally shorter and require less materials to cover...again, to incorporate the same square footage of space. Domes in general only require about 60% of the materials to build as compared to a rectangular structure of the same square footage. I have been involved with designing and building domes for over 30 years and people are constantly reporting to me that the maintenace costs are much less for the domes than for the home that they had before....and we aren't even considering the energy savings, which can be as much as 70%. Many have reported that the 30 year roofing that they purchased is actually lasting 30 years, or more. If a dome is properly constructed and roofed, then the maintenance costs will be consideraly less than most homes being built today. I hope this helps answer your question. If you need further assistance, please feel free to contact me.

AA10220292	I've done this before. There are a few steps and they can fall in a million different orders.     1. Find a CAREER, not a job. Companies see risk in a relocating candidate (whether they are footing the bill or not). You want them to believe your worth the risk and that your more worthy than a local applicant. Be available for interviews via the phone or in person.    2. Housing. easier said than done. Once the job is taking shape; ask for suggestions. Where do people in similar positions in the company work.    3. Honestly know how big a process packing, loading, moving, unloading, setting up, etc will take. Cross country requires at least a week and a half.    4. Keep at it!! It does happen and not everything will go smoothly. Be prepared and have a support network (family or otherwise) ready via phone or something to talk. It's a rough transition and your already established relationships should not go to waste.|`|AA10984416	That's how I'd work it. Get the job lined up first, with a start date a couple months off.

Indian Airlines/Jet Airways/Sahara -  is providing 50 per cent discount on basic fare for all domestic flights in Economy Class to senior citizens having the age of 65years (men and women).

La nuova legge non fa differenza tra i tipi di contratto parla genericamente di lavoratori dipendenti e pertanto il lavoratore a contratto interinale  pur sempre un dipendente.

Puoi decidere che ti venga invece trattenuto in azienda (e qui dipende se l'azienda  sopra o sotto i 50 dipendenti, nel primo caso va all'inps nel fondo tesoreria, nel secondo rimane in azienda) oppure destinarlo al fondo di categoria o a un fondo aperto di tua scelta.|`|9b5728c105d60adb2c327ac2ff3a240baa	ci sono 2 casi:  1)se il lavoratore era gi attivo prima del 31/12/2006 deve dare una preferenza prima del 30/06/2007 (esattamente come i dipendenti a tempo indeterminato, con le stesse opzioni)    2)se il lavoratore tato assunto dopo il 01/01/2007  si differenzia tra:    A) contratto fino a 3 mesi continuativi:   il tfr viene liquidato a fine missione    B)contratto superiore a 3 mesi: la scelta va espressa entro sei mesi dalla data di assunzione ( es. contratto dal 01/02/2007 fino al 31/12/2007, la scelta verr effettuata entro 30/07/2007).

4gMdp2nwaa	Though it is uncertain how much more the property market is going to fall - land has always been used as a hedge against inflation. It looks likely that we will face inflation in the next year and investing in land is one way against protecting against a fall in your net worth - in general as inflation increases so does land prices.    So, I would start thinking about it but as everyone say be prudent and make sure that you are not buying in a place where property prices have spiked significantly over the past few years.|`|sJURfVrVaa	If you're looking to improve your quality of life, then decide what for you would be a reasonable price to pay.  Start looking, and if you find something that fits your price and vision, then feel free to buy.    Anything beyond that is speculating in land values, which really is anyone's guess at this point.  Some say it could drop another 20% nationwide while others say we're at fair value.    Whatever you do, you don't want to over-leverage the investment, though the banks will usually make sure you don't at this point.|`|2iBjMGIAaa	It all depends.  If you have the money to spare than I say go for it.  The market is very low right now, and you can find some real bargains.|`|bHy3GMuKaa	If you absolutely love the place then go negotiate a deal.  The real estate market will fall much farther though so if you can wait, then wait.    The banks know that interest rates are gonna climb to 7% + three years from now.  They are holding their money so they can lend it later to make a much higher profit per loan.  Makes sense right?  The problem is that it will hurt the real estate market for now.  As a result, prices will continue to decline.    The only way that scenario doesn't play out is if Obama/Congress establish rules of receiving bailout money and that is to make loans to the public.  And Obama had better do this otherwise he's gonna look worse than Jimmy Carter.

In effect it is asset backed paper.    The purchase is completed and the  purchaser now owns the property, and is responsible as a property owner. Failure to pay, failure to insure or pay taxes can give the mortgage lender the right to demand full payment, or begin procedure to foreclose. If foreclosure proceeds, the loan is fully due and payable.  Depending on jurisdiction, the owner may have a grace period to complete repayment before eviction.    In a few jurisdictions a mortgage evictee may pay and regain possession.    The lender always has the right to pay taxes and insurance to protect their interest. This can be simply added to the amount due next month. But it can be cause for a demand to pay in full.|`|qBCGH52haa	A mortgage is a loan given to someone to buy a property.

While it is always nice to be debt free, Student loans generally carry a low interest rate.  In addition, normally the interest you pay is tax deductible.  I would suggest that you take the money that you would have used to pay off the loan and invest it. Consider putting some into a Roth IRA. The rest can go into stocks, bonds or real estate.    That said, you do need to look at the interest rate on the loan before making a decision. Normally these loans are far cheaper than mortgages, auto or consumer loans even without the tax benefit.

AA10984198	Pay rates in China vary greatly.    For a chinese person working in China they could be earing 2500 to 8000. But most of the network, technical people have almost no idea what they are doing, have little knowledge, don't speak English (and in some provinces I need to find someone who can translate from Chinese to their local language).    but probably between 6000-12,000 RMB. Anything less than 10,000 RMB would not be worth going to somewhere like Shanghai or Beijing for, unless you really want the experience. But seriously there are people in this sort of roles being paid less than 3000 RMB in major companies.    If you speak and read Chinese you might get an advantage, but technical support roles don't pay that well.|`|iz3jZXcIaa	RMB 8,000

I believe they want you to update every 2-3 years, which means your cost could be spread over a longer period of time.     Overall, QB is relatively simple and user-friendly while still allowing you growth options. Also, enough people are familiar with the program that you could always hire somebody, in case your business grows quickly.|`|hlnRBzZzaa	It depends how much you want to do.

A friend of ours runs a B&B.  She used to pay someone to come in to do the ironing.  (Good market - smaller B&B's that don't put their linen out to the laundry.)  My sister takes her ironing to someone locally.  She does the washing but outsources the ironing.    Presentation, as has been said elsewhere, is key.

cdt4F6ZWaa	To answer your last question, you can't fight it because really, there's nothing to fight about, sorry to say.You absolutely have to pay at this point, because as you now know, you are entirely responsible for your repair bill. It sounds like a perfectly honest mistake on the part of the repair shop, and unfortunately the repair shop had the wrong address and that's where everything went wrong.  It could have been a computer error on their part, but even so, the collection agencies could care less.  So basically it's up to you to make sure the repair shop had the correct address.  As for you insurance company, even though your insurance company initially said they would pay for the repair, it's up to the policy holder to check in and ask them if they're paying or where things stand.    So to sum it up, collection agencies don't know if you went overseas, or don't care, or they don't care about an address mistake.  It's now up to them to make sure you pay.|`|VPycXVIlaa	It's something you need to work out with your insurance carrier. If you're not covered then you should change companies.     If you don't pay off hte collection it will hurt your credit score which could effect interest rates on future loans, could make interest rates on your credit cards go up, could keep you from being able to rent a property.. etc. Basically anything that is effected by a bad FICO score.|`|b007371eab69364e811cf06269921755aa	Anya couldn't be more wrong. You absolutely CAN fight this, and you SHOULD.     First off, were you overseas serving with the military? If so, the SCRA is your friend in this matter! The government doesn't approve of creditors/collection agencies playing fast and loose with those who serve our country and enacted that law to protect our servicemen.     Next, send this collection agency a demand to validate letter. State that you were overseas and they were not sending the letters to the correct address so you consider your dispute "timely" which is very important when dealing with collection agencies and the Fair Debt Collections Practice Act. Send this letter certified, return receipt. Keep a copy for yourself.     At the same time, get after your insurance company and demand to know why they are not paying for this. Fight them on this front too.     That is where you need to start. If you need further help, learn your rights under the FDCPA. You can also visit CreditBoards.com (it's a FREE discussion forum, much like Yahoo Answers) and get help from others.     Good luck.
Pjm9pg7iaa	They are the basically the same. A co-signer has the right to use the thing being financed. If it was a car, the co-signer could drive it and buy insurance on it and register it. A guarantor could not do those things. The guarantor just promises that the money will be paid back.  On a rental, the co-signer could live there and order utilities. The guarantor would not. The guarantor just promises to repay money owed.    Since the guarantor did not need the car or apartment, they are really like a co-signer..|`|tdQTZPI7aa	Your dad's name is not on the loan or deed but guarantees to make the payments if you can't.

If you as you admit said horrible things, that is harassment.  Management gave you a second chance right there by not firing you.  Your actions in the fitting room were uncalled for - you damaged property and as they said, endangered a customer (not to mention the bad customer relations you engendered).    Anger management could be considered a disability, but the question now becomes have you been diagnosed for it properly and are you seeking treatment.  If you are not seeking treatment for a diagnosed disease, you certainly can't expect management to turn a blind eye to your actions.|`|DZCFD0p2aa	you belong locked away away from normal people.

OtYAkRrRaa	I've never heard of a potential employer wanting you to come in and work for free, however they are definitely interested in you because they want you to come in. This does look like a tryout.  You can either.  1. Move on and look for something else or  2. Use this as a tryout. On both theirs and your part. Put your best foot forward. Dress professionally, speak well, be as mature as possible and the worst that could happen is you don't like it. They are obviously more interested in you because they gave you the opportunity for a trial period however.. having said that I am still a bit unsure of their legitimacy. Are they a legitimate business?  Hope this helps.

OacSIfSiaa	Collections agencies like to get people to send in payments thinking that it will settle the debt, but the collection agencies want to come back again for more money so they hate to put anything in writing.  You can however turn the tables on them.    Since you offered to settle, you have reset the states SOL on seeking legal action.  You can do the following in hopes of settling this debt. First send a letter of "offer in compromise".  If they accept then send a cashiers check with the following written on the back:      By accepting these funds, you hereby agree that this account is paid in full without protest and that you will remove this account with each credit bureau that you submit to. Your cashing of this check constitutes you have agreed to my offer. No collection activity may be attempted any further and my credit reports will reflect this change.      By sending a check with this verbiage, you are offering in no uncertain terms to settle the debt and be done with it permanently. If the creditor cashes the check knowing it has a restrictive endorsement on the back, they have to abide by terms. Some creditors may write on the back 'Cashed under protest" so that they can continue to collect the balance. To avoid this, make sure you send an offer in compromise letter first and once they agree in writing, you send this letter above. I don't recommend that you arbitrarily send a check like this until you have gotten the creditor to agree prior. Doing so may jeopardize your position.   Also state laws vary in the use of "restrictive endorsments".  Be sure to check your state laws regaiding the use of this instrument. You can contact your state attorneys office to find out.    But remember this, they may take the money and be happy, they have less work to do and they did get something for their effort.

Try contacting them again, and ask to speak to the supervisor of the person you were speaking with.     Keep in mind that when you got into the debt, you agreed to pay the full amount.  Now you are trying to change that agreement.  They don't have to do this, but if it is all you can afford, they are likely in a better position if they do so.

AHCelSY1aa	This has nothing to do with Texas law.  It's clear across the board.  Why do they think that?  Because they are idiots and hope the former employee does NOT KNOW what there legal rights are.  In most cases unfortunately they do not.  Additionally, many of those severance agreements due to the language is NOT legal anyway.  The firm I work for presently has a client.  The language in her agreement was she was to specifically waive all rights regarding age discrimination (ironically over 40,) disability (ADA - and she is disabled) etc... Yet, all other rights that we have it goes on to say she can still sue on those grounds.  If that's not outright blatant admittance of guilt I don't know what is.  She was smart enough to do a little research and found she was able to still pursue legal grounds if done with X amount of time.  So she met the statute of limitations and her former employer is going to regret the day he messed with the wrong woman.|`|SAgCy83Oaa	I guess they believe that the former employee might read what he/she was signing and - if they had any questions - they would ask before signing.  I doubt that they think the former employee believes he/she has "no rights at all" - just that he/she understands what specific right he/she signed away.  It's the standard contract structure: Offer (sign away the specific rights listed in this document) Consideration (the severance check) and Acceptance (employee's signature).  They have a contract and have every right to expect that the former-employee will abide by the contract.
q0oZ8eOzaa	Yes and no. Many companies will not care that you have a degree in a particular emphasis to work in that field. Others will require it.    A few years back the company I work for now in Aerospace was hiring me on as a employee. I had worked there previously as a contractor. The first thing they wanted to see was my computer related degree. Fortunately, I had pursued an CIS degree at a local university in a 16 month degree completion program. This was on top of a 4 year advertising degree that I had completed many years earlier. The University had let me use my first two years of college credits under my old Advertising degree count towards my freshman and soft. years.

sJURfVrVaa	Several factors are at play for all car makers.    1.  Cheap financing in previous years has led to an over-supply of vehicles on the road.  People bought more than they needed and that over-supply will last several years.    2.  The credit crisis has made money for new vehicles much harder to come by, and so financing is not as available for those who want to buy.    3.  The recession has made people much more reluctant to buy big ticket items so they would rather make their cars last longer in uncertain times.    4.  GM, Ford, and Chrysler are in particular difficulty because of their reliance on the higher margin vehicles to fund their profits.  Those are the least likely to sell during these times.  Further, their labor costs are much higher than other car makers (particularly Asian), and so their expenses are much higher than their income at this point.  They had no reserves to fall back on and their solvency is in question.|`|wcOq60Hhaa	The US auto industry is dependent upon cheap financing to (1) fund operations and (2) fund consumer purchases.

And if its a joint account, $500k..there are other ways that FDIC insurance can extend coverage thorough registering your account in different ways..  to learn on FDIC insurance as it pertains to security of your money check out FDIC.gov..  for credit unions check out NCUA.gov    When Freddie Mac went under their bank side business was affected..FDIC (federal deposit insurance corporation) came into play...people were wainting in line at the banks to get their money.. there was none..So FDIC stepped, and a clients got their money within two weeks..really FDIC took over and made freddie into a federal bank...so dont sweat it..if your a millionaire then have many different banks.    Hope this helps..|`|PdnO2dntaa	I think a safe in your own house is the most realible..LOL

blC1U6LFaa	It will positively affect your score.  How much it will affect your score is dependent on your balance to limit ratio.  The credit repositories look at high balance to limit ratios as derogatory.    If you are decreasing your BTL ratio from 100% to 25%, you'll see dramatic changes.  Usually you'll see the most movement when you decrease BTL ratios by 25% or more.    How much do you currently owe on the card?

And then, they MUST record the transaction on the phone, with you saying "yes". They are NOT permitted to debit your account without this requirement.

It will have little value in a corporate computer world. It is a great entry level position certification.    All that being said, I would suggest you work towards some other certs in Microsoft or Cisco and also pursue a 4 year computer related degree. These are your best bet for the future. You can use your A+ to get some initial expereince but it will not get you much beyond that.

xJi3ixgGaa	You would get the 9k back this year but could claim up to 6k next year for a total of 15k.  That is as long as you buy a home for at least $150k    Here is some general information:    I have heard rumors that people who received the $7500 may not have to pay it back under the new bill but that is still rumor. The details are changing everyday on this bill and I would not be sure of anything until it is signed.    It is my understanding that the $15000 it is NOT retro active. The new bill will be active from the day the bill is signed and for a year thereafter. Also this is not the same as the $7500 tax credit already in place. The $7500 you have to pay back, the $15000 you do not.    HOWEVER this is what a lot of people don't understand. Just because you buy a home for $150,000 doesn't mean you will get a check for 15,000. You will only get back what your tax liability is for the year you claim it.    For example if you paid the government $5000 in taxes in 08 and you break even (they don't owe you, you don't owe them) then they will give you that $5000. You can do that for 08, 09 or 09,10. If your taxes end up the same for the following year, then total you will get $10,000 dollars. For people like myself who are single and don't make a lot of money I would only get about $4000 total.    It is very deceiving so be careful where you get your information from.|`|mCTLLul3aa	2 soon to tell for sure how it will work. i know i get back more than i pay because of child tax credits. looking forward to the extended EIC next year.|`|nnRlFxfTaa	The tax credit is in addition to, if you owe 9000 in taxes and you paid 9000 in taxes that is your tax due, 15000 is over and above that

4MypYVHYaa	You might not be able to refinance because the property might not have increased in value for any potential refinance within a years time.    Are these same people on the mortgage loan? If they are removing them from the title/deed does not relieve them of the responsibility of making sure the monthly mortgage payment is made. If for some reason the monthly mortgage is not made they will be called by the lender and will have a hit on their credit report for any 30 day mortgage lates    If you simply want to remove their name from the title/deed, go through with the refinance. Once you have qualified and been approved for your refinance then the title company will require them to come in and each sign the title over to you.    If the refinance fail to materialize you may still remove them from the title/deed simply by making an appointment with a local title company. Everyone on the title will be required to come in and sign their portion of the property over to you.     You would want to use a title company as it could save possible legal problems in the future.  Again if they are on the mortgage documents they still have the obligation of the monthly mortgage payment.    I hope this has been of some use to you, good luck.    "FIGHT ON"|`|AA11215123	Sure.

Let them know that you are concerned about the slow healing rate and about future injuries to your back.     Also, consider that perhaps you are giving ALDI more loyalty than they would give you.  There may be nice people at the company that you would prefer to avoid being inconsiderate to, but remember that if their manager said to lay you off or fire you that they would do just that.  Companies are interested in the bottom line.  Sure they want a good image, but in the long run it is the money that they will protect instead of the employee.  You have to watch out for yourself.|`|3mAgM405aa	AC's response is right on given the fact that you initially have to negotiate with your current employer so that you do not appear to be totally a malcontent.  You really want to continue working at Aldi in another support position which does not require heavy lifting.  And if the negotiations fail, you are welcome to give Aldi adequate notice of resignation and seek employment elsewhere.  Bringing in an attorney at this stage would be premature.    Good luck!|`|LsBS5bOCaa	If I were you, here's what I think you should do:     Priority:  Get the secretary job if they call you, because the economy is so bad and you need the money and a job without any lifting.    Optional:  Regardless of probation, consult  a lawyer (no-fee lawyer) about your rights to any disability or compensation granted because it was an on-the-job injury.  AND in case it wasn't in your job description to lift boxes, something can probably come out this that's owed to you on the part of ALDI....maybe paying for your doctor's bill or something like that.    Good luck. You'll be alright.

A collection agency can pursue a debt until the day you die unless A) you live in a state with a "statute of repose" which effectively kills the debt, or B) you have sent them a cease and desist letter.     Expiration of the statute of limitations provides you with an "affirmative defense" but you would have to raise this defense to the court if you were sued for this debt. You can also countersue, as suing on an expired debt is a violation of the FDCPA.     Resetting the statute of limitations is determined by state. Such states allow for the SOL to be reset by making a promise to pay, while some do not allow for resetting under any circumstances.|`|C0tYtelFaa	Do not admit any liability, promise to pay, or make payments toward this debt.      The company that is contacting you is what they call a "junk debt" collector.  These companies are in a practice of buying significantly old debts (for roughly 1 - 2 cents on a dollar) and then trying to force you to pay on it.      What you should do is send a certified letter, return receipt requested, advising them to cease and desist communications with you.  They have to abide by this request.  In one sentence, tell them that the time for collection of debt has expired.  If the debt collector chooses to press this further, you can always answer their complaint with your defense that it is past the statute of limitations..    Also, the debt most likely is past the statute of limitations, provided you did not leave the state where you incurred the debt and/or did not make a promise to pay or made a payment (depending on your state).      Be very careful of these kinds of debt collectors.. They are fly by night outfits who generally use all sorts of illegal tactics to try to force people to pay.. Hopefully you do not allow yourself to be victimized..    Feel free to contact me if you need further help on the issue..|`|L4rlu2BDaa	How old is the debt, if it's over 6 years then they can still chase you for it but cannot take you to court to enforce it, so in theory you don't have to pay them a penny and just ignore them.

Natwest's is good - they offer a free overdraft of 1250 for the first year the account is open, with the option to raise it each year after that for up to four more years.    If you put 5000 into that account upon opening, your account will show as having a balance of 5000 and an available balance of 6250, meaning you can withdraw up to 6250 without paying any fees.|`|0R5gf3Abaa	most students usually apply for one either during intro week or during the summer before they start uni, but obviously you cant do that.  best thing is to look at the different student accounts, see which ones offer extras that'd be useful for you, then visit your preferred branch to make an appointment to open an account    definitely get one though cos student accounts have much better terms than normal current accounts (free overdrafts, graduate loans etc)|`|QrHUzhvlaa	every bank has different procedures depending on ur circumstances and the documents available to u... better go to any bank and see an advisor
8bNaX89Daa	This varies from location to location but since your amount is "almost" $10,000 you are looking at small claims court almost anywhere in the U.S.. $10,000 or less is usually the small claims standard.    First, go to the courthouse nearest you and get a booklet that is designed for litigants (people taking legal action without a lawyer) and read it over carefully. It will outline the procedure and the requirements necessary to proceed with your claim.    Gather all your legal documents together that pertain to your claim and make three copies of everything.    Take one copy of your documents to the courthouse so it can be attached to the actual claim that you will file with the court when you pay the fees. The claim document comes in triplicate so the original stays with the court and you keep the copies.    Then, on that same day, take one of the copies of the claim that you have and put it together with the second set of the copied documents and give that to the defendant, either by registered mail or by a certified processor. (this will prove that the party received your claim).    The defendant will be given time to respond in which case he will do the same thing, file his defence with the court along with his documents and give you a copy of the same.    The original legal documents, which you made copies of earlier, will be your physical evidence that you will present to the judge at trial. The last set of these documents is for you to keep for your records.    A court session will be set up for both parties to come together with a mediator to try and resolve the issue. Sometimes its obvious that one party is at fault and so arrangements for either payment or dismissal are made. Sometimes both parties feel they are right and the matter cant be resolved and is set for trial.    Study the book the court gave you so you know how to present your case clearly and properly at trial.    Dress for court in a professional manner if possible and present yourself the same way.    Bring your witnesses to trial, keeping in mind that they must have first-hand knowledge of the issue at hand and cannot be third parties.|`|BlVudiyfaa	Enforce the contract that governed the transaction.

Remember that many employers are not interested in the specific degree you have but that you have one. A degree tells them 2 important things about you:    1. You are teachable. Most employers are going to train you anyway. They realize that college textbooks are usually way out of date and so the content you learned is less of a concern to them. They really want to know if they can train you and a degree indicates that you can be taught.  2. You will complete what you start.

4gMdp2nwaa	An increase in dividends is usually a good sign for a company. It means that after expenses and future projected cash intakes it can pay out more to the share holder. This translates to meaning that the company is becoming more profitable.     This is especially true if you can see that the dividends are growing constantly - like what you show above.|`|BlVudiyfaa	Dividends are payments made by a corporation to its shareholder members. It is the portion of corporate profits paid out to stockholders. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, that money can be put to two uses: it can either be re-invested in the business (called retained earnings), or it can be paid to the shareholders as a dividend. Many corporations retain a portion of their earnings and pay the remainder as a dividend.    For a joint stock company, a dividend is allocated as a fixed amount per share. Therefore, a shareholder receives a dividend in proportion to their shareholding. For the joint stock company, paying dividends is not an expense; rather, it is the division of an asset among shareholders. Public companies usually pay dividends on a fixed schedule, but may declare a dividend at any time, sometimes called a special dividend to distinguish it from a regular one.    Cooperatives, on the other hand, allocate dividends according to members' activity, so their dividends are often considered to be a pre-tax expense.    Dividends are usually settled on a cash basis, as a payment from the company to the shareholder. They can take other forms, such as store credits (common among retail consumers' cooperatives) and shares in the company (either newly-created shares or existing shares bought in the market.) Further, many public companies offer dividend reinvestment plans, which automatically use the cash dividend to purchase additional shares for the shareholder.

There's no way to pull up status information until your refund is at LEAST one week late according to the Where's My Refund tool.    There's nothing that you can do to expedite the process and pestering the IRS toads only increases the likelihood that something will happen to further delay the processing of your return and the release of any refund.|`|4mmTyMglaa	Because the level 1 employees (the people you get to talk to) don't get any information about the actual processing of a return and cannot control anything with how/when your return is processed.|`|Bty7looPaa	I can't tell you what is going on, but I absolutely feel your pain. I filed on the 16th and was accepted the day after, and given a DD date of 1/30. Then they delayed my refund to processing delays. Then they said there was a glitch in the syaytem and don't trust the 2/24 date on their website. Then they told me my return is in errors. Then they told me my return was NOT  in errors. Yesterday, they said i should have DD by Feb 13 (to subtract 10 days from website date) and fnally, today, a hr block rep called me and told me IRS sent her an email that they will start to release funds for DD recipients tomorrow starting at 7pm. WTF? Why can't they just tell us the truth? I'd be a little more patient and understanding if their answers were consistent. THis is nothing but added stress when you get told 500 different things. Best of luck to you. I think I may just start smoking cigarettes.|`|znr8SBiWaa	I'm not really sure they even know what is going on.  They're pretty well clueless at this point.    However, if you check the WMR site too many times, it will start spitting out errors at you.  That does not mean there is a problem with your return.  Check your bank tomorrow.  If it's not there, give it until Tuesday or Wednesday, then call back and raise hell.|`|ZFvg0auTaa	You know, I have not a clue!!!  At least they still have yours in the system!

The main point DON'T GIVE UP, you let them know you not going to give up or go away, I have fun calling them everyday when I have free time lol.

If you have no income, you won't be able to pay off the medical bills. It's very simple. They won't just "go away" If you wish to keep your credit score from plummeting from them, you need to pay them off. That takes income. The first thing you should do is apply for medicaid to prevent this from happening again, then get a part time job to pay off the debt you have already incurred. There is no "quick fix" to this and nobody is going to pay them for you.   lot of students are able to work a few hours a week and go to medical school or any other kind of college. No it isn't easy, but if you had gotten the medicaid to begin with you wouldn't be in this situation.    If you're unwilling to generate the income to pay your debt then they will remain on your credit report. It's very simple. I would think a Med student would know this. The debt is NOT going to just go away unless you pay it. So you need to make a choice. Work a little harder to get the debt paid, or let it get written off and lower your credit score.|`|0N3YYnDjaa	I made $300 this month spent $0!

znr8SBiWaa	If your taxes are being offset, you should have gotten a letter in the mail stating so.  However, it could have been lost in the mail, as the P.O. is fairly useless, just like the rest of the government.    If you moved, you may not get the letter as well.    There is a phone number than you can call to determine if you are going to have your federal return offset for any reason.  The number is:    1-800-304-3107    You will need your Social Security Number to check if there are any debts that will reduce your federal refund, including student loans.    Because student loans are a federal debt, they will rarely be taken out of your state refund.    Also, you must be 270 behind in order for loans to default and be taken out of your return.|`|0S7JNY5Aaa	Shouldn't take it dont sound like you are in default.|`|AA11284831	Call 1-800-304-3107 to see if your SSN has been flagged for an offset.    If your loan is in default status your refunds are at risk, even if you have a payment plan in place.|`|zX4nU1Rtaa	they shouldnt take any of ur money if u have a payment arrangement set up|`|BqXSymxjaa	The only way to find that out is to call them and ask.

8xMhLMoRaa	You can only really get a paper round or something similar. You are too young to get what I would term a 'real' job. Why don't you ask your parents if you can do odd jobs for them, or ask your neighbours if you can babysit for them? Sometimes people are grateful for the help of older children as they relate to the younger ones better than adults would. Good luck!|`|3mAgM405aa	Here's a short list of jobs in the U.S. which you can create to generate income:    1. Learn calligraphy so that you can provide handwritten invitations and thank you notes to prospective wedding parties, birthday celebrations, etc. Seek out clients through wedding planners at nearby churches and temples. A starter calligraphy kit usually runs around $20 and anyone can easily pick up this skill. The going rate is usually $1 per hand addressed item.    2. Seek from your neighbors a gardner position which involves planting, weed removal, plant/tree trimming, light brush clearance. You will be using the neighbor's equipment and tools. Again, do not represent yourself as a lawn mower since there are any number of safety issues involved. A door-to-door solicitation of surrounding neighbors is required and you can charge between $6 to $9 per hour.    3. Offer policing/removal or clearance of trash services to surrounding neighbors which involve trash pickup within nearby residential area. Limit the extent of pickup to small areas and be aware that there are no hazardous terrain or elements involved in this process. Again, a door-to-door solicitation of neighbors is in order. You can charge between $6.75 to $7.50 per hour.    4. Acquire a set of window cleaning tools [a bucket, liquid window cleaner, sponge, squeegee, handle with an extension and a small step ladder] and solicit local businesses for your window cleaning services. However, be careful to limit the height of the window cleaning to no higher than one story. Charge $1 per window panel.    5. Visit your nearest beauty salon and ask to be trained as a shampoo person who is also willing to sweep up fallen hair on the ground and do set ups [arranging dye kits, curler holders, etc.] for a set hourly fee.    6. Become a sign flipper by contacting your nearest realtor. A flipper is someone who stands at a major intersection and flips a "For Lease/Rental" sign in order to attract visitors to an open house or to a particular real estate listing. The hourly pay is at least the minimum wage.    7. Why not become a paid feeder servicing the disabled at nearby nursing, convalescent, assisted living/care centers and hospitals. It involves feeding food to patients who are unable to feed themselves. The starting rate is $8.00 per hour. The only downside is that one has to take precautions to wash one's hands after each feeding. A posting of your services [by a business card or flyer] on a reviewable bulletin board would be enough to generate customers. The paid feeder position is one of the fastest growing occupation at this time.    Good luck!|`|5h0nUQODaa	goodluck.. haha i've been looking for the past two years, since I was fifteen.

In this case you would have deducted the your state taxes on your return last year so you have never paid tax on the $300.  This would generally make this taxable.      As for the student loan interest, you need to determine from the financial institute if the second one is a correction of the first or if they are both eligible student loan interest paid in the year.  So if it is from the same institute you need to verify with them that this is a correction or an additional amount.

sB1sM0shaa	You may be getting ahead of yourself a bit. Before you commit money to the stocks it would be important to learn the stocks. And, yes, people make money in the stocks or else no one would do it, but keep in mind that people also lose money in the stocks.     If you would like to learn about the stock market I have included some helpful sites. Here they are:     1. The Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) offers two types of practice traders. One is called a "virtual trader" and the other is "Paper money". I have experience with the virtual trader powered by optionsxpress and I like it very well. Go to www.cboe.com and click on their "trading Tools" tab where a crop down menu shows you the two different traders I just mentioned.     You may want to check out the whole slew of other tools under the same tab, however, I suspect that those tools will overwhelm you. I mention this site mainly as it has a "free virtual trader" and as such you can practice, practice, practice till you feel confident.     Though there is much talk of options, the trader also is useful for stocks so don't be intimidated.     2. Get a free stock chart program from MarketBrowser. This is a very good program with several tools that can help you. They have several links to various news and stock information sources. The program holds up to 12 charts (maybe more) per worksheet and the charts are fabulous to look at. The program also has the capacity to give you currency charts (though I don't use it for this).     3. Learn the basics about stocks and develop specific trading strategies at www.zecco.com as well as www.thethirdimension.net. Both sites are geared toward penny stocks (especially the last one mentioned). I myself prefer strategies that involve options (stock) and so have included a link to it. The Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) also has a learning Center which gives you different trade strategiesgive for options as well as a basic overview of what they are.     4. For news I use yahoo finance as well as google finance. I like Yahoo finance for overall market news and google finance for specific news on individual stocks.     Armed with the above information you can safely begin your learning process. Don't feel like you have to commit money, and when you are ready you can always ask yahoo answers for recommendations for online brokers.     I hope this helps.|`|BlVudiyfaa	I made $27,986.54 last week buying and selling options.|`|dC6A5R5Saa	Start here: http://www.amazon.com/Trading-Living-Psy...    Amazon is great place for finding books about trading or investing.    There are 2 goals in the stock market.  A dividend income stream or capital growth.    - People who aim for capital growth attempt to buy shares low and sell them high.    - People who invest for income are only interested in stocks that pay dividends.  They don't aim to sell, because they want the income steam.  Income investors look for financially healthy stocks that pay dividends    Coca Cola (KO) is a great example.  It's been around since 1886.  It always makes profits and even survived the Great Depression.  Coke's dividend is 3.50%.  If an income in a CD is 2.5%, income investors will buy into Coke.  If the share goes lower they'll buy more because the yield is now even higher.    Once Coke goes up, income investors accumulating stock for their income stream will stop buying and look elsewhere.  Now the capital growth people start buying because their focus isn't the dividend, but rather buying the share price low and selling it high for a profit.|`|AevtOtzPaa	stay away from the stock market... things are very bad and professional mutual funds are posting huge losses...|`|nz5p4NU2aa	You have to open a brokerage account in which you buy shares from.

K7x1RHVFaa	that is confusing in the part about "I have already paid for it." as relates to "When/How?"    Typically you pay the penalty and taxes at the point of disbursal or you fill out a 1040 ES within 90 days of disbursal to cover the taxes and penalties encurred. There are penalties for not doing this.     You should set up an appointment with a CPA/Tax expert and do this right away or if you are able to get an appointment with the IRS go down there and bring your disbursal receipt or 1099 and have them help you fill out the 1040 ES so you can give them a check for the amount oweded.    I always had the investment company tax it for me after I estimated the penalties involved. It is on the document you sign for the disbursal. I simply filled in the amount myself.    Good Luck.    I forgot to mention the investment people are not required to do this for you and the 1099 only reflects what you tell them to tax you.|`|tA8T4QYFaa	You'll receive a 1099 showing how much you took and how much tax was withheld.

The role of a Manager must be a good dictator, smooth way to handle all queries, encourage the staff in all aspects and get maximum benefits from every corner, and the important thing is that a manager must be a good learner whereby he should learn and find new things in day-to-day life in order to satisfy all kinds of customers.     2. The major lacking is that without considering the present and past actions like Organization & Employee's welfare, one should not implement any rules and regulations.    3. Not only concentrating on money-spinning but also maintain the customers by giving service and benefits regularly without any lapse....To make the company into a respectable position is my long term goal..

Such as, is this something you want to achieve for the rest of your life? Who is to say that $4,000 a month in 10 yrs will be what it is today? In this world you get nothing for nothing, most people dont get rich because of being lucky, or being at the right place at the right time. Instead, you get it by creating value(doing or providing something that others want or need). You see, every time we engage in a transaction, it is because someone has something or some service that we value, so we are willing to exchange with them so that both parties are satisfied and delt with equally. We use money only when one party doesnt have something that the other party wants, so money takes the place of an object or a service as a universal tool of exchange. Now, people are assets, things are not. Things in and of themselves have no intrinsic value, its people that give them value. Now, lets say you do start making $4,000 a month by some how creating value for someone or a company. Your Human Life Value is now roughly $480,000 a year(excluding taxes, because depending on how your being taxed(capital gains tax, or a Sub S-corp election, etc) you will pay anywhere from 13.6%-over 25% of your gross earnings). Now, right now, that may seem like a lot, but chances are you will be in a paradigm of where you will want to buy more things as your income is great, so you'll start buying more liabilities and you wont accumulate assets, so your balance sheet will be off and your finances will be a complete mess. Further more, in 10 years, who knows if $480,000 is enough to live a good life style on. I can tell you now that its a good life style, but its not that good. If you bought a 2004 Aston Martin Vanquish for $180,000 , your looking paying around $2,500 a month as a payment, not to mention repairs(which is actually a lot after awhile, they suck to break because only Aston Martin can fix them) and insurance. Or, if you bought a $1.2 Million house, your looking at payments on a 30 yr mortgage being around $8,000 a month. And depending on where you live, $1.2 million for a house will get you a regular house. So, its not really a good idea to decide that you want to create portfolio income of $4,000 a month and live off of that for the rest of your life, instead your question should be, What value can I create for you, that way, you'll fill in a gap for someone who has a need for the value you can provide, and they'll provide you with value in turn(hence the expression, "Value for Value" and "Dollars follow value").|`|a2affba74f073c3abbcf3174a04740caaa	please let me know if you find one.

Genauso wenig bist Du verpflichtet, eine Malerfirma zum Anstreichen zu nehmen, auch, wenn das im Mietvertrag steht.    Lt. BGH-Urteilen:  - Solche Klauseln in dem alten Mietvertrag sind nach diesen Urteilen nicht mehr gltig. Da aber die alten Mietvertr?ge alle ihre Gltigkeit behalten, mssen Mieter in jedem Einzelfall anhand ihres konkreten Mietvertrags berprfen lassen, ob ihr Mietvertrag tats?chlich noch gilt oder nicht.  - Kein Mieter ist verpflichtet, Reinigungen von einer Firma ausfhren zu lassen. Der Vermieter braucht sich nur nicht mit Pfusch oder m??iger Hobby-Handwerkerqualit?t zufrieden zu geben. Hauptsache ist, die Arbeiten sind sauber und fachgerecht durchgefhrt. Kaution darf nicht einbehalten werden. Ist der Vermieter nicht einverstanden, zum Gericht gehen. Am besten trotzdem umgehend beim Mieterverein nachfragen.

This is done by writing a 'CV' (curriculum vitae - Latin for 'life story'), called in some countries a 'resume'.          Different countries may have different requirements and styles for CV resumes. So you must follow the correct practice for your culture and country. However, we will try to give you important principles and advice.          WHAT IS A CV RESUME FOR?        A CV resume is quite simply an 'advert' to sell yourself to an employer. You should send a CV to an employer when they ask for one in a job advert, or when you are enquiring if any jobs are available. So the purpose of your CV is to make you attractive, interesting, worth considering to the company and so receive a job interview.          An employer may have several hundred enquiries about a single job, he or she will only choose a few people who appear suitable for interview.          Therefore, your CV must be as good as you can make it.          GENERAL ADVICE        If you are a student, there is probably a career advice office in your place of study. They are there to help. They may have fact-sheets of advice on how to prepare a CV. Make full use of them. However, employers do not want to see CVs which are all written in exactly the same way. Therefore, do not just copy standard CV samples! Your CV should be your own, personal, and a little bit different.          A CV should be constructed on a word-processor (or at least typed), well laid out and printed on a good quality printer. Do use bold and/or underline print for headings. Do not use lots of different font types and sizes. You are not designing a magazine cover! Do use plenty of white space, and a good border round the page. Do use the spell-check on your computer! (Or check that the spelling is correct in some way) Consider using 'bullets' to start sub-sections or lists.          Because you are using a computer or word-processor, you can easily 'customise' your CV if necessary, and change the layout and the way you write your CV for different employers.          Picture yourself to be a busy manager in the employer's office. He (or she) may have to read through 100 CVs in half an hour, and will have two piles - 'possibles' and 'waste-bin'.          So yours must be easy to read, short and attractive.          There are two communication principles to remember:              *'KISS' - 'keep it simple, stupid'.              *'If they didn't hear it, you didn't say it'.          So, when you have written a first attempt at your CV, get someone else to look at it, and tell you how to make it better.        Ask your friends, your tutors or teachers, your career office, family friends in business. What you have written may seem simple and obvious to you, but not to an employer! Go through it again and again with a red pen, making it shorter, more readable, more understandable!        Before you start            Sit down with a piece of paper. Look at the job(s) that you are applying for. Consider how your skills, education, and experience compare with the skills that the job requires. How much information do you have about the job description?            Sometimes employers do not give enough information. Ask for more detail if needed. Spend time researching detail about the job(s) that interest you and information about the employer - their structure, products, successes, and approach - from:             Their own publicity, reports and publications             A library (business reports, trade papers)             College career office             Newspaper reports             The Internet         WHAT TO INCLUDE        Personal details            Name, home address, college address, phone number, email address, date of birth.             Do you have your own web homepage? Include it (if it's good!).            If your name does not obviously show if you are male or female, include this!         Education            Give places of education where you have studied - most recent education first. Include subject options taken in each year of your course. Include any special project, thesis, or dissertation work.              Pre-college courses (high school, etc.) should then be included, including grades. Subjects taken and passed just before college will be of most interest. Earlier courses, taken at say age 15-16, may not need much detail.         Work experience            List your most recent experience first. Give the name of your employer, job title, and very important, what you actually did and achieved in that job. Part-time work should be included.         Interests            They will be particularly interested in activities where you have leadership or responsibility, or which involve you in relating to others in a team. A one-person interest, such as stamp-collecting, may be of less interest to them, unless it connects with the work you wish to do. Give only enough detail to explain. (If you were captain of a sports team, they do not want to know the exact date you started, how many games you played, and how many wins you had! They will ask at the interview, if they are interested.) If you have published any articles, jointly or by yourself, give details.              If you have been involved in any type of volunteer work, do give details.         Skills            Ability in other languages, computing experience, or possession of a driving licence should be included.         References            Usually give two names - one from your place of study, and one from any work situation you have had. Or if this does not apply, then an older family frien|`|5598a9cf799f6c01eb8445c32ce6918faa	You know go to www.resume.com and look for samples under your speciality.

Starting now is the best thing you can do, because anything you put in now is going to be worth 3 or 4 times as much as it would if you put it in 20 years from now.    I don't know the British rules, but talk to a financial planner about what vehicles work best in Britain.  There may be various tax free methods that work well.  And understand the rules about what you can take out for.  Some types allow you to borrow money, essentially paying yourself interest down the line to buy a house or other key events.    A bank can be a good starting point, at least educate yourself as to what they have available.  I'm sure they will be happy to provide the brochures of their products.  Some would have them online.|`|865f900aac43f0954c36406292c7c675aa	ABSOLUTELY not to early... should of started years ago !!!    Depending upon how much you want at retirement you can go to "msn money central" and use their calculator to determine how much you need to put away for how many years you have till you need it.  It will be under the "savings calculator".  I recommend that site to all I tutor.    Since you are talking about pounds be sure the calculator is giving you pounds answers or just assume it is in dollars and you can divide almost in half.    Does your banking system / financial advisors offer IRA like they do here in the states?  If so then once you figure out how much you need to be putting away each week, get it all into one of those accounts.  Keep in mind an IRA is simple like a empty pail... you need to put something within it.  A mutual fund is great for diversity and since you are just starting out, a financial advisor will answer any questions about which mutual fund is right for you.    Keep in mind...  NO employer is responsible for YOUR retirement... you must take care of it on your own and make it happen for no one cares about your future..BUT YOU SHOULD !!    Happy Investing !!

Go with the flow, and don't stress too much. People don't expect tons on the first day, lots of time meeting co-workers, filling out paperwork, finding your desk, the bathroom and the break room.    Be sure to go to lunch or whatever meal break with some coworkers and get to know people a bit, as scary as it is, it's the quickest way to get into the flow of things.    Every job is scary for two weeks for everyone, you'll get through it..

If it was included and discharged in your bankruptcy, you need to get this fact recorded by the court.  Once the judgment has been satisfied it should be removed from your credit report.  I need to research this a bit, as I haven't run into it yet with anyone I've helped.

f94b1b3c74bcd45cd2ede6368e25b9b4aa	I've been self employed for 3 years and when I started searching for another career a few months ago I had a horrible time. I just landed a great job though after applying some of these techniques.... This is what I learned....        When you apply for a job, try to contact the company directly.  Many of the jobs that I applied for through careerbuilders, monster, and other sites didn't get sent.  I found that I got a much better response if I applied directly to the company.  I used monster, indeed, and careerbuilders to find the jobs and then went to the corporate website.        Make sure you cover letter and resume are amazing!  Sometimes I had to completely re-do both documents for each new opportunity.  For the cover letter I would suggest that you address the fact that you are a stay at home mom and then relate it to the position that you are trying to land.   Use very professional language.  I always liked http://www.executiveresourcesltd.com/Job... .  Also make sure you address why it is that you've decided to return to the work force.  Employers may be weary that you might want to return to being a stay at home mom.  Erase this doubt!          For the resume, I think formating is very key.  I would list your current job as a stay at home mom (search and find the most professional sounding name for that career).  Next have a paragraph explaining what it is you do and then have a bulleted list (bolded) that highlights the qualifications that you have regarding the job that you are seeking.  Maybe something like:    Jan 2004- Present   Professional homemaker,   City, State  Created and maintained schedules for a 4 person family.  In charge of all financial aspects including budgeting, risk analysis, and acount handling.         *  Ability to multi-task  -  explain here     *  Time management - explain here       Remember above everything that you are selling yourself.

eb1320fc6cbef5a39e1f58280f7b8fe8aa	The basic formula for calculating the GDP is:    Y = C + I + E + G    where     Y = GDP    C = Consumer Spending    I = Investment made by industry    E = Excess of Exports over Imports    G = Government Spending      This formula is almost self-evident (if you take time to think about it)!    GDP is a measure of all the goods and services produced domestically. Therefore, to calculate the GDP, one only needs to add together the various components of the economy that are a measure of all the goods and services produced.|`|1b81f67dded2ac64ea0103900146971caa	A region's gross domestic product, or GDP, is one of several measures of the size of its economy. The GDP of a country is defined as the market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. It is also considered the sum of value added at every stage of production of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period of time. Until the 1980s the term GNP or gross national product was used in the United States. The two terms GDP and GNP are almost identical. The most common approach to measuring and understanding GDP is the expenditure method:    GDP = consumption + investment + government spending + (exports ? imports)|`|c80c70d797c95a2b14e18053d9d96cfcaa	gross domestic product is the number of goods n servuces in your country plus goods n services in your country by foreign nationals minus total no of goods n services by your nationals in foreign. these are diffrent record putting agencies but few are more authentic like ISO which are recording every update in both goods and services.

This includes most personal expenditures of households such as food, rent, medical expenses and so on but does not include new housing.   I is defined as business investments in capital. Examples of investment by a business include construction of a new mine, purchase of software, or purchase of machinery and equipment for a factory. Spending by households on new houses is also included in Investment. 'Investment' in GDP is meant very specifically as non-financial product purchases. Buying financial products is classed as saving in macroeconomics, as opposed to investment (which, in the GDP formula is a form of spending). The distinction is (in theory) clear: if money is converted into goods or services, without a repayment liability it is investment. For example, if you buy a bond or a share, the ownership of the money has only nominally changed hands, and this transfer payment is excluded from the GDP sum. Although such purchases would be called investments in normal speech, from the total-economy point of view, this is simply swapping of deeds, and not part of the real economy or the GDP formula.   G is the sum of government expenditures on final goods and services. It includes salaries of public servants, purchase of weapons for the military, and any investment expenditure by a government. It does not include any transfer payments, such as social security or unemployment benefits. The relative size of government expenditure compared to GDP as a whole is critical in the theory of crowding out, and the Keynesian cross.   X is gross export. GDP captures the amount a country produces, including goods and services produced for overseas consumption, therefore exports are added.   M is gross import. Imports are subtracted since imported goods will be included in the terms G, I, or C, and must be deducted to avoid counting foreign supply as domestic.   NX are "net exports" in the economy: gross exports - gross imports. There is a fixed relation: NX = X - M.

4f0cd81d2ec75d84539080d16c5944b7aa	fiscal policy    Measures employed by governments to stabilize the economy, specifically by adjusting the levels and allocations of taxes and government expenditures. When the economy is sluggish, the government may cut taxes, leaving taxpayers with extra cash to spend and thereby increasing levels of consumption. An increase in public-works spending may likewise pump cash into the economy, having an expansionary effect. Conversely, a decrease in government spending or an increase in taxes tends to cause the economy to contract. Fiscal policy is often used in tandem with monetary policy. Until the 1930s, fiscal policy aimed at maintaining a balanced budget; since then it has been used countercyclically, as recommended by John Maynard Keynes, to offset the cycle of expansion and contraction in the economy. Fiscal policy is more effective at stimulating a flagging economy than at cooling an inflationary one, partly because spending cuts and tax increases are unpopular and partly because of the work of economic stabilizers. -|`|AA10401458	Fiscal policy is manifested in a government's policies on taxation and expenditures. To obtain funds for their operation, government units generally collect some form of taxes. The expenditure of these funds not only provides goods and services for constituents, but has a direct impact on the economy. For example, if expenditures are larger than the funds received by the government, the resulting deficit tends to stimulate the economy, as goods and services are produced for government purchase. In contrast, if a government runs a surplus by not spending all the funds it collects, economic growth will generally be curtailed, as the surplus funds are removed from circulation in the economy.|`|26b58f090f3edfbdd055b095807c5833aa	Cant you just flip to the glossary section of your textbook?|`|9249c05c0891c00e16353a0fc5c21663aa	The use of government spending and taxation, as opposed to monetary policy (interest rates and money supply), to try to influence the level of economic activity.

I would never use a referee that spoke badly of me.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	You just put it down with your regular work experience; one doesn't explain in a resume why one left a job.

If you are specifically asked about your former employer's opinion of you in your interview you can explain the situtation then.  Until it is brought up by your interviewer (you never know...it may not be) focus on your positive attributes and describe how good a worker you think you are.|`|AA12287840	Definitely leave it off of your resume.  Listing No prior work experience is better than listing a past non-satisfied employer.  They don't need to know everything.  Good luck to you.|`|AA11613807	You don't need to explain this in your resume.  You just need to say what you did there, and the skills you acquired.  They might ask you why you left, and you don't say anything about why you left in your question.  If you were fired, you will want to be honest and say you were and why.    I don't understand how people at the job are giving you a bad reference, but you hear other people say that you were a good employee...so it's a bit difficult to give you a recommendation on who to use as a reference from that company (if anyone).    If a potential interviewee comes to you and says that they are going to contact your previous employer, and you are in the United States, the worst that your previous employer can say is that they wouldn't hire you for the position.  If that was the case, and you had a second interview, you could address the reasons why (and be honest).  If you didn't do a good job, was it because you were not willing to work hard, or were you not given the leadership and tools necessary to do the position.....(I'm assuming it's the latter, of course...).    Good Luck!

As for price...what is your time worth?  How long, or far will you walk each dog? I would price based upon a 30 minute walk, and ask for ......at least $5 per walk, but then you know the economy in your area. You could also offer a discount for purchasing package deals....say a walk seven days a week for 10% less, or daily for a month w 15% off...you get the idea.    You can also use flyers to spread the word. Spend some time in a given heighborhood you want to target, & note which folks have a dog.

They are free to join.       Please click my screen name or avatar for more information and a link for proof of payment and lots of specific details.      I made some nice money at first, but once I found out these sites were legitimate, I started adding referrals and the money got a lot better. For every person you refer, you get 20% of what they earn. And for every person that one of your referrals refer you get 10% on one site and 5% on the other. In time--this could be a great source of income--making money while other people are in a sense, working for you.     If you get 5 referrals who earn $20 a month, that is an extra $20 in your pocket. If you get 100 referrals earning $20 a month, that is an extra $400 you'll earn every month!!!    And by the way--never join a work at home program that wants you to pay up front. If they were making that much money, they wouldn't need to charge you.    Note: There is a third site whose referral program works a bit differently, but they have a really high payout.|`|da11b15dab4691d0356d4ffb0fa37b7daa	I am in the process of hiring a few recruiters.

ef0430c15caae03f0aee562ec7dfe35aaa	Partnerships can be tricky in the best of situations, with an older relative half way around the world, it could be pretty tough.    If you think he may try to dominate the partnership claiming his many years experience versus your lack of it, you could end up very unhappy.    Business experience is a funny thing, I bought my company two years ago and took it from a company that wasn't making money to one that's making quite a bit of money. How did I do that? well the former owner despite the fact that he had worked in the field his whole life, over forty years, and ran the company for twelve, had allot of gaps in his general knowledge of how to run a business.  His years of experience weren't worth much, they just kept him afloat.  You seem to be an intelligent person, you don't need a degree in business to be successful in business. Keep your eyes and your mind open, and your cost low and you'll do fine.    Tell your uncle you value his advise and hope he will help you but you need to do it yourself, make your own mistakes, that's the only way to learn.    Good Luck|`|75a2be4bcb9b35c6139b684666a9f05aaa	Sometimes starting a business with a relative can be a good decision. It all depends on how much you can trust your uncle. If you feel that there is a chance of possible problems you might want to start it yourself or a friend. If you decide to start it yourself makes sure you do good research.    But if you think that there will not be a problem that you should start it with him and make sure to keep the relationship professional.     Starting a business is all about your call,you make the decisions.    I too am an Indian living in America, so i can relate to what you are asking.    Good luck  :D
