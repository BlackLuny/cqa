20090220102902AAzgd3i	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	Have you ever met someone with the same sun sign but had a complete different personality than you?	If so, what are your moon/rising sun ( you can add mercury/venus/mars if you want ) and the same with the other person?       -----       I don't know very many Sag suns, except my sister but I would not say that she is the opposite of me. We have our differences but I would not say we are opposites.       I used to have a friend who was a Sag ( Aquarius moon, Scorpio Mercury, Scorpio Mars, Sagittarius Venus ) and I'm a Sag sun, Leo moon, Sagittarius Mercury, Scorpio Venus, Aries Mars. I remember her always being a compulsive liar. She'd always lie to me about having sex and having a boyfriend... She actually thought I cared if she had a boyfriend or not, which I didn't. I, on the other hand, am honest most of the time, or I try to be. She also never cared much for learning or for any intellectual pursuits where as I'm the complete opposite, which is weird because she's an Aquarius moon. She also accused me one time of being judgmental, snobby, and selfish. I'm not a judgmental person, but I do judge a person if they deserve it and she did. She has done a lot of stupid things and has messed up her life for it.

20090220101533AA5XlSs	Entertainment & Music;Polls & Surveys	Sexual innuendo definition?	Sexual innuendo is a hard topic to stay on top of. As a humor tool, it stands erect in the English language. While there are no hard and fast rules as to what constitutes sexual innuendo, there have been many mass-debates on the topic, and now the general principles at the root of the topic are firm and well-rounded.      Although sexual innuendo requires masterful manipulation of parts of speech (and sometimes the skillful use of body language), for most people it comes quickly.      A common problem with sexual innuendo is the recipient being unable to wrap their hands around the intended meaning. In this case, an individual using sexual innuendo will often start slow and eventually build up, increasing depth more and more until the recipient feels the actual thrust of the point and the innuendo climaxes.

Who else is appalled that TMZ posted a picture of Rihanna that was obviously taken during the investigation of her "alleged" assault.  Do they not realize the damage this does?  Its things like this that keep many victims of domestic violence from reporting their abuse and seeking help.   They have no decency at all in my opinion.  I think their editor should spend some quality time with Chris Brown and see what a good a** beating feels like.    I'm not even going to post the link because I don't want to draw anymore hits to their site.

20090220105330AAhNoZT	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Did you know there was such a thing as idiot sightings?	IDIOT SIGHTING:   We had to have the garage door repaired. The Sears repairman told us that one of our problems was that we did not have a 'large' enough motor on the opener. I thought for a minute, and said that we had the largest one Sears made at that time, a 1/2 horsepower. He shook his head and said, 'Lady, you need a 1/4 horsepower.' I responded that 1/2 was larger than 1/4. He said, 'NO, it's not. Four is larger than two.'               We haven't used Sears repair since.      IDIOT SIGHTING      My daughter and I went through the McDonald's take-out window and I gave the clerk a $5 bill. Our total was $4.25, so I also handed her a quarter. She said, 'you gave me too much money.' I said, 'Yes I know, but this way you can just give me a dollar bill back.'  She sighed and went to get the manager who asked me to repeat my request. I did so, and he handed me back the quarter, and said "We're sorry but they could not do that kind of thing.' The clerk then proceeded to give me back $1 and 75 cents in change.            Do not confuse the clerks at McD's.                 IDIOT SIGHTING :   I live in a semi - rural area. We recently had a new neighbor call the local township administrative office to request the removal of the DEER CROSSING sign on our road. The reason: 'Too many deer are being hit by cars out here!   I don't think this is a good place for  them to be crossing anymore.'       >From Kingman , KS ..                   IDIOT SIGHTING IN FOOD SERVICE:   My daughter went to a local Taco Bell and ordered a taco. She asked the person behind the counter for 'minimal lettuce.' He said he was sorry, but they only had iceberg lettuce.      From Kansas City                    IDIOT SIGHTING :    I was at the airport, checking in at the gate when an airport employee asked, 'Has anyone put anything in your baggage without your knowledge?' To which I replied, 'If it was without my knowledge, how would I know?' He smiled knowingly and nodded,      'That's why we ask.'      Happened in Birmingham , Ala.                   IDIOT SIGHTING:    The stoplight on the corner buzzes when it's safe to cross the street. I was crossing with an intellectually challenged coworker of mine. She asked if I knew what the buzzer was for. I explained that it signals blind people when the light is red. Appalled, she responded, 'What on earth are blind people doing driving?!'       She was a probation officer in Wichita , KS                             IDIOT SIGHTING:   At a good-bye luncheon for an old and dear coworker. She was leaving the company due to 'downsizing.' Our manager commented cheerfully, 'This is fun. We should do this more often.' Not another word was spoken. We all just looked at each other with that deer-in-the-headlights stare.       This was a lunch at Texas Instruments.                           IDIOT SIGHTING :   I work with an individual who plugged her power strip back into itself and for the sake of her life, couldn't understand why her system would not turn on.      A deputy with the Dallas County Sheriffs office, no less.                              IDIOT SIGHTING :   When my husband and I arrived at an automobile dealership to pick up our car, we were told the keys had been locked in it. We went to the service department and found a mechanic working feverishly to unlock the driver ' s side door. As I watched from the passenger side, I instinctively tried the door handle and discovered that it was unlocked. 'Hey,' I announced to the technician, 'its open!' His reply, 'I know.. I already got that side.'       This was at the Ford dealership in Canton , Mississippi                    STAY ALERT!      They walk among us... and the scary part is that they and  they  REPRODUCE !

20090220120610AAecKwx	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rap and Hip-Hop	Why do the Lil' Wayne haters whine so much? Shut up already!?	Okay, don't get me wrong - I'm all about voicing your opinion and having the freedom to like and dislike what ever you please. In fact, I'm extremely anti-government because I love my PERSONAL rights so much (another topic for another time...)      Anyways, everyone knows that even the greatest people have a pack of haters. It's the truth, you see it every single day. And I admit that I dislike a lot of musicians/rap artists that most people (at least in the south) enjoy; however, I don't go around trashing their fans for enjoying their "music". So although I may be a "hater" of the music, I'm not part of the pack of obnoxious, idiotic, and uneducated band of haters that seem to group around successful individuals.      The reason, again, as to why I don't do this is because I am a firm believer that everyone is entitled to their own opinions - just as the haters are. I just don't think it is right for a hater to attack the fans of whoever they so happen to be hating on.      For example: Lil' Wayne.      Okay, we understand. YOU DON'T LIKE LIL' WAYNE! But nobody asked for your opinion. Nobody cares that you don't like him. So when the fans (like myself) attempt to explain our reasoning behind liking him, maybe try stepping up to the mature plate and having an adult conversation (or debate, rather) instead of turning into a child and throwing around insults that make no sense.      I've attempted to have a conversation with a Lil' Wayne hater on several occasions and none of them seem to be on mature enough or educated enough to have a debate with me about this. I'm honestly curious as to why haters dislike him so much. There are probably some people out there with reasonable explanations as to why they dislike him but I haven't met a hater competent enough to explain it to me in an adult manner. I don't talk the language of a 5 year old, much less the language of "temper-tantrum"...      Some haters start insulting on his looks or his voice - most simply start throwing around invalid insults such as; "He's gay!" or "**** him!" or "He's dumb!" - I'm failing to see any plausible argument here?      Basically, the point of this post is to attempt to send a message to all the haters out there (be you a Lil' Wayne hater or some other kind of haters) and that message is: SHUT THE HELL UP! If you don't like him/them/it then maybe you should get educated enough to find a real reason behind your hatred or just don't open your mouth at all. If you hate him so much why waste your time trying to down him and all of his fans - don't you have better things to do? Probably not...      Thank you for reading. I hope you haters find a way to grow up and somehow manage to function in your every day endeavors with such a limited mind and horrible communication skills.      Why do Lil' Wayne haters whine so much?

No Speak English          A Russian woman married a Canadian gentleman and they lived happily ever after in Toronto .  The poor lady was not very proficient in English, but did manage to communicate with her husband.  The real problem arose whenever she had to shop for groceries.      One day, she went to the butcher and wanted to buy chicken legs.  She didn't know how to put forward her request, and in desperation, clucked like a chicken and lifted up her skirt to show her thighs.  Her butcher got the message, and gave her the chicken legs.      Next day she needed to get chicken breasts, again she didn't know how to say it, and so she clucked like a chicken and unbuttoned her blouse to show the butcher her breasts.  The butcher understood again, and gave her some chicken breasts.      On the 3rd day, the poor lady needed to buy sausages.  Unable to find a way to communicate this, she brought her husband to the store...         (Please scroll down.)                                                                                                            What were you thinking?   Hellooooooo, her husband speaks English!                                                           --------------------------------------...

20090220122301AA9pgMm	Entertainment & Music;Music;Rock and Pop	Dave Mustaine vs Chuck Schuldiner?	To some, these may not be a good comparison, but I think they are very similar in a lot of ways.     1.  They both have been the mainstays in their respective bands and have surrounded themselves with some great musicians over the years   2. Both are primarily rhythm guitarists who do vocals   3. Both also do some leads but delegate most solo's in their songs to whoever is lead.   4. Both started out with rough/fast records and gradually mellowed down through their discography   5. Both have had the reputation as being difficult to work with (maybe thats why there has been so much turnover in each band)   6.One band is Death the other Megadeth  ....(kinda reaching on that similarity)         Chuck    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgK60w0yH...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGmWLQPQm...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xRyl_p1z9...       Dave    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydwZpmYQn...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebvmS9Mr2...     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcUx7WftP...       To me its almost too close to call, I love both bands.  I think Chuck definitely has the edge in lead work, but rhythm I may give to Dave.  I preferred both of their vocal styles in their early days.      MQ: so, who do you think is better and who do you prefer?      BQ: Who do you think had better musicians to work with?

But others say that isn't true and that we might never know what caused it. He is charged for beating up his ex, including bitting her. Chris gave a $50,000 bailout and already had a trial. He apoligized for it but she was appalled that he even tried.       When I saw the picture of her after the incident they only thing I said was that she chose the wrong guy... he has a good voice and is kind of cute but.... wrong guy.

After all the background checks, interviews               And testing were done, there were 3 finalists;               Two men and a woman.          For the final test, the FBI agents took one of               The men to a large metal door and handed               Him a gun.          'We must know that you will follow your Instructions no matter what the circumstances.          Inside the room you will find your wife sitting       In a chair .. . . Kill her!!'          The man said, 'You can't be serious. I could       Never shoot my wife.'          The agent said, 'Then you're not the right man       For this job. Take your wife and go home.'          The second man was given the same instructions.       He took the gun and went into the room. All was       Quiet for a bout 5 minutes.          The man came out with tears in his eyes, 'I tried,       But I can't kill my wife.' The agent said, 'You don't       Have what it takes. Take your wife and go home.'       Finally, it was the woman's turn. She was given the       Same instructions, to kill her husband. She took the       Gun and went into the room. Shots were heard, one       After another.  They heard screaming, crashing,       Banging on the walls. After a few minutes, all was       Quiet. The door opened slowly and there stood the       Woman, wiping the sweat from her brow.             'This gun is loaded with blanks' she said.  'I had to       Beat him to death with the chair.'                MORAL:                Women are crazy. Don't mess with them

20090220132207AATeBrz	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Old joke but still funny hopefully there's a few out there that haven't heard this one?	A guy playing golf starts out with his best round he's ever played.   On the first hole he hits and eagle and the second hole he birdies.   Right before he tees off on the third hole he gets a call form the hospital.   The Dr. says: "Your wife was just in a terrible car accident and you have to get here right away !".   The guy thinks this is best round yet, so he tees off on the third hole and hits a hole in one, for the first time ever.   He proceeds to finish all eighteen holes, then goes straight to the hospital.   The Doctor comes running over with a look of disgust and says "You finished all 18 holes didn't you ?"   The man says nothing just puts his head in his hands ashamed of what he has done.   The Dr. says: "Well you can forget about golf, your wife is going to need constant care, day in and day out you'll spend helping her. I hope it was worth it because your free time is gone!"   The man end up breaking down in tears   Dr. laughs and says: "Naaa I'm just messing with you, your wife died 2 hours ago, how did you shoot?"

20090220121349AAL2vwK	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	Haha i never thought of it like this.. Us girls are strange eh?	A woman has a close male friend. This means that he is probably interested in her, which is why he hangs around so much. She sees him strictly as a friend. This always starts out with, you're a great guy, but I don't like you in that way. This is roughly the equivalent for the guy of going to a job interview and the company saying, You have a great resume, you have all the qualifications we are looking for, but we're not going to hire you. We will, however, use your resume as the basis for comparison for all other applicants. But, we're going to hire somebody who is far less qualified and is probably an alcoholic. And if he doesn't work out, we'll hire somebody else, but still not you. In fact, we will never hire you. But we will call you from time to time to complain about the person that we hired.

20090220122328AAxge4l	Entertainment & Music;Music;Singing	Vocal range question?	Hi, I'm a member of a choir and I sing the bass part. However, a few weeks ago I met a singing teacher and she told me that my voice is more like a higher baritone ...or a tenor. But I'm not able to sing above middle F.  How can I extend a bit my range? OK, I know that the best is to go to a teacher -- and I'll do this from September. But I'd be grateful if you gave me some advice. Is it a good way (to reach higher notes) to practise scales and try to reach higher notes?   Thanks for your comments.

20090220141425AAI3O83	Entertainment & Music;Horoscopes	I need help this time everyone!?	i know i should be worrying about other things i have around me but i'm so not gonna be in peace unless i feel secure about my concern.    I mentioned Guy A & B are brother and both liked me ..      Guy B (cusp Sagittraius/Capricorn)did but he basically let me down by whenever we wanted to meet each other we never could and he never made the effort to at least be sure when he could have tried to. He used to call me and used to say he liked me and wanted to be my b/f. Then on the next night he said he just wants to be my friend. I'm thinking is he playing games with me and in Jun 08 i called him but he said he was busy..Busy?! in Myspace?? doing what?  i though fck it i aint calling him again. didn't think he was too interested.      Guy A..(lol Taurus) what could i say about him? We kinda had a fling but never went too far and we had sexual feelings fo each other but it wasn't the way i wanted a relationship with anyone. I knew somewhere inside of me i would end up falling for him but would have got my heartbroken so i wanted to end it. We are in contact nowadays but he seems too distant now i can't talk to him, no calls or texts. so its best for me to give him space and carry on with my life.      Guy C>>(dont know his sign) i dont think there's a chance (Descrption: Tall, Slender/fit, light skin and baldish) I thought he's good looking, looked at me once and little spark or something but i didn't see him on Monday where i usually have the same Uni lecture as him. But his friend kept looking i'm like what? Nothing is gonna happen.      All i'm explaining is that i have not messed with two brothers as i know they talk too and i didn't do anything either because Guy B liked me and we both liked each other and drawn to each other but all cos of Guy A came in the way and i honestly told him that i'm sort of in contact with his brother. He was cool about it but as things went on cos of GUY A-sexual things- i had to let it go because of unfairness and complication. There were something fishy about them brothers and i didnt like but did initially wanted to walk away..for good. I even called Guy A to give him birthday wishes. Guess what? Just after two mins Guy B called....weird or what?      As for Guy C i thought maybe i'll have a go at trying to talk to him and get to know him, which would have helped me move on with my life and be happy again.       These things are really reeling in my head and want to get the bottom of it for good and end it. i still wanna be both of their friends but don't think i could have a relationship with them as one of them would get jealous of one another. What could i do??      I felt all this was my fault and not thinking straight and i wasnt at first until i got a little suspicious..      what do i do now?!

Let's say your employee at Macy's (or other retailers) got angry at a coworker and got confrontational with that coworker and a few days later, banged her own head into the wall at the fitting room in front of customers.

So when I tried out I got a call back, but my drama teacher (who's in charge of the show) thinks I would be really good at leadership, which is assistant director and stuff, so she put my call back under leadership. So I told my mom that I wanted to get a part in the play not a leadership position and she sent an e-mail to my drama teacher that said how much I wanted to be in the show and not leadership. And my drama teacher wrote that I was really good at both but now I have to tryout AGAIN on Monday but if I don't get another call back then I can't be in the show AT ALL! But with leadership i could still be assistant director but i HATE leadership!   HELP ME!!!

20090220145200AAubpVh	Entertainment & Music;Other - Entertainment	What is good party music?	In years past I have thrown MANY parties and I always tried to match my music to my theme and tried to create an eclectic mix of tunes but no one ever seemed that into my choices. I've concluded that what people really want in a party atmosphere is ONLY pop, and hip-hop from the last few years, and have narrowed my play list to just these genres. No one wants to hear old party tunes or rock. I personally like EVERYTHING but I want to make my guests happy. I want to keep my next party alive. Am I at least partially correct in this assumption? Will keeping Kanye, Rihanna, Justin and Britney on hand help liven things up?

I think it's a Wes Craven film, but I'm not positive. I'm sure it was made in the 90's, and I think she was driving a Jeep, or some kind of SUV. Other than that, I can't really remember anything about the movie.

Okay, I'm planning on cosplaying for an anime convention in August and I need some ideas for who to cosplay as.      -I'm female, but I'd perfer a male character to cosplay   -I'm not exactly very skinny. I'm kinda chubby   -I'm short. 5' 2". But I can use platform shoes or something else.   -My hair is dark brown and goes just a little past my shoulders.   -I’m young[about 15] but I can pull off looking about 13 - 18. But I won’t be able to look too much older.      If the character you suggest has a different hair color then my natural color, I can buy a wig so that’s no problem.

20090220142834AAjspYf	Entertainment & Music;Jokes & Riddles	What do you think of this joke?	Mr. Bear and Mr. Rabbit didn't like each other very much. One day, while walking through the woods, and they came across a golden frog.      They were amazed when the frog talked to them. The golden frog admitted that he didn't often meet anyone, but, when he did, he always gave them six wishes. He told them that they could have 3 wishes each.      Mr. Bear immediately wished that all the other bears in the forest were females.      The frog granted his wish. Mr. Rabbit, after thinking for a while, wished for a crash helmet.      One appeared immediately, and he placed it on his head. Mr. Bear was amazed at Mr. Rabbit's wish, but carried on with his second wish.      He wished that all the bears in the neighboring forests were females as well, and the frog granted his wish.      Mr. Rabbit then wished for a motorcycle. It appeared before him, and he climbed on board and started revving the engine.      Mr. Bear could not believe it and complained that Mr. Rabbit had wasted two wishes that he could have had for himself.      Shaking his head, Mr. Bear made his final wish, that all the other bears in the world were females as well, leaving him as the only male bear in the world.      The frog replied that it had been done, and they both turned to Mr. Rabbit for his last wish.      Mr. Rabbit revved the engine, thought for a second, then said, "I wish that Mr. Bear was gay!" and rode off as fast as he could!          Star if you like!

My friends say I am seductive and I seduce and attract ALOT OF MEN, but I don't try to seduce or flirt with men, it naturally happens. I often feel that i have two dominating personalities. Sweet vs. Sexy or Nice vs. MEAN personality. When I did my birth chart I was a moon in scorpio and my rising is either a GEMINI or a TAURUS, but I was born at night towards 10pm which should make me a Gemini Rising. I been told I have MULTIPLE personalities lol. I kinda fit the "VIRGO" definition most of the time. I also have a two-sided thing just like gemini and i have TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE mood swings that pretty much vary depending on how I feel or what happend.

20090220125932AAfZHxR	Entertainment & Music;Music;Other - Music	What do you think of this song, "play that funky music white boy? "?	I heard a song titled, "Play that funky music white boy."       As a Caucasian (White), I am a little offended.  What if I create a song titled, "Play that funky black boy?"  I am sure this will offend the african-american crowd.       I think white people are more tolerant than the black folks. If the black population feels offended, then there is rioting. However, if the white population feels offended, then there is no rioting.       This is how I feel, and think there can't be a one way street.       Let me know how you feel.      Thanks.

But I kept hope, I figured a new summer would bring a possible new tour. I check up on their activity regularly and finally I see news... and what does it say: "September 09 Muse will be touring.. France... then moving all across Europe."      Why is the US being left out!? Come on!         F*ck you Matt. F*ck you Chris. F*ck you Dom. and finally, F*ck you Morgan.

They're silly, and fun, and girly, and I enjoy reading one on a cold night.      But the movie didn't do it justice      - Massie did not live up to my expectations. There was no character work and Massie could have been a great character, but she was stereotypical. And the eyebrow lifting obsession? It got old fast.   - Alicia was good to watch, but she wasn't as gossip-master-ish as I thought she'd be. She looked exactly how I pictured her, minus the big boobs.   - Dylan was horrible. I expected her to have long, thick wavy red hair, not wiry fake curls. She wasn't sturdy or big, like the book says she is. She was definitely a size 2, not a size 6.   - Kristen was beautiful, I think. But not how I imagined she would be. She was a little more glamorous than sporty.   - Claire was how I thought she'd be..more or less. She had the hair and the sweet face, and she was pretty good.      But Layne was prettier than Massie! And Chrisabeley was butt ugly. Vincent was hilarious. And massie's room was beautiful.      BIG THUMPS UP for the clothes, and hair. They were gorgeous.

OK I really I mean really like the anime vampire knight and vampire knight guilty. But I was wounding if they (you know like who made vampire knight) ever went on in story. Is there more after Yuuki left the school (you know on the last episode of Vampire knight guilty how she left with Kaname.)? I dont care if its in episodes or manga. So is there another season of vampire knight after Vampire knight Guilty? If yes I have two questions. If it does go on in the episodes what’s the name of the next season?  If it goes on in manga what chapter or value is it that it goes on from the last episodes of vampire knight Guilty?
