d0ec44a1ce1f1112d30c20dbd968de4baa	If a breaker doesn't trip when you flip it, replace it immediately! It is defective or worn out. They do go bad. When it is 'buzzing', it is heating up. Just because it doesn't trip, doesn't mean it is OK. It is very simple to replace a breaker. Turn off your main power supply. Remove panel cover. Use a voltage meter to check to see if you have successfully turned off the power by setting meter to '250V'. Now, touch one connector to where the wire goes to the breaker and the other to the big aluminum grounding block (that's where a bunch of wires go to together!). No voltage! Good. Remove the screw holding the wire on the breaker. Mark it with tape as to which one it is (1, 2, 3) Now, unscrew the screw holding the breaker in place. Some types have two (older ones). There are a few different types of breakers in use (SquareD, GE, etc.) Go to your hardware store and get the correct replacement. Merely replace it the same way as you removed it. Having only three breakers, I would go ahead and replace all three (only 6-7 bux each).  Good Luck!|`|544f733941555bd8141d61267e8ee132aa	switch it on and U will get the answer

As marcas de mvel dever?o ser feitas em todos os cantos de todas as paredes, indicando onde ficar o forro.  Tendo como base as referencias de nvel, instale em todo o permetro das paredes uma guia de 2,5 X 7,0 cm. Esta guia dever, preferencialmente, ser aparafusada contra as paredes.  Um v?o de 3,00 metros dever ser subdividido, em pelo menos, 3 v?os de um metro. Marca, em duas guias opostas, 1,00 metros a partir de cada parede.  SE!!!  o v?o tem mesmo 3,00 metros ent?o devers cortar duas guias de 2,5 X 7,0 cm com 2,95 metros de comprimento, as quais dever?o ser pregadas s guias onde fizestes as marcas de 1,00 metro. Para facilitar esta opera??o, podes pregar um taco de 2,5 X 7,0 cm com 20 cm de comprimento contra a guia onde est?o as duas marcas de 1,00 metros.   Contra este taco prega a guia de 2,95cm que cortastes. Isso nas duas paredes opostas.    Ficastes com um estrado composto por tres tiras de 1,00 X 3,00 metros.    Agora deves pregar o forro contra este estrado. Isso  trabalho para duas pessoas. Tu podes pregar no centro de cada tbua ( mtodo mais grosseiro), ou contra a aba maior da fmea, neste caso use pregos sem cabe?a, um martelo n?o muito pesado e bata os pregos at o fim, sen?o eles impedir?o a entrada da tbua macho.   Antes de pregar passa, com um tubo de bico fino, cola branca (PVA) dentro da tbua fmea.  Encaicha a tbua macho na fmea j com cola e pregada. Passa cola na parte fmea que ficou exposta, prega contra o estrado e assim sucessivamente at o final da parede.  Caso no final n?o de uma tbua inteira deves medir o que falta e cortar ao longo da tbua, caso sobre muita madeira, ou utilizar um cepilho ou garlopa para retirar pequenos excessos.  Pregada a ltima tbua, seria interessante a coloca??o de um rodaforro para dar acabamento. N?o esquece que o rodaforro deve ser cortado n?o a 90 graus, mas sim a 45 graus para formar um canto vivo.

That is often the first section in a repair manual that gets you familiar with what you are repairing and what all the various things are called.  So later on in the manual when a term is used, you can figure out what they are discussing.  Like if something refers to an armature, you would know what it is.    Nomenclature can also refer to how a manufacturer identifies their product.  Like on a Briggs and Stratton engine, the model, code, and serial numbers are all stamped on the flat part of the pull cord shroud facing the carburetor.|`|f10ebdaf0188ca166507aae70c628222aa	aaaaaaaaaah  i dont know him|`|I2iMyanraa	Nomenclature is a big part of understanding.

The poster states the top is marble, but it is clearly cultured marble, so don't get too excited about that part.    If you go to get this one and you don't like it, all you are out is a bit of gas.  No small thing these days, but I bet it is less than the shipping for the other one.|`|NkBs6EtYaa	If it is really marble a top pr is it fake marble to simulate marble. Also keep in mind you have to still buy faucets that will run you $35.00-150.00 each. Depending on taste....

I bet you could buy this at Home Depot or Lowe's, and take it back if it did not fit etc.

Il guaio  molto semplice, quel buontempone dell'elettricista che ha fatto l'impianto in casa tua ha interrotto il conduttore neutro invece che il conduttore di fase.    Quasi nessun problema con le lampade ad incandescenza, se non la possibilit di prendersi una "sventola" pulendo il lampadario anche a luce spenta, molti problemi con tubi al neon e lampade a risparmio energetico.

Un bacio!|`|etshVwCNaa	Caro ALEJOHN22, la risposta : SI,  possibilissimo, anzi  proprio cos, ma soprattutto te ne motivo il perch. Devi sapere che sa l'AMMONIACA che la CANDEGGINA - che si usano entrambe per le pulizie di casa - contengono delle sostanze molto FORTI, corrosive, caustiche ed IRRITANTI per le nostre mucose degli occhi e delle prime vie aeree: se ti si arrossano gli occhi, se ti viene il mal di gola e la tosse,  perch le tue mucose di quelle zone sono particolarmente sensibili e, quindi, sviluppano una certa allerga al contatto (anche sentendo solo l'odore forte!) di quelle 2 sostanze.    Ti do' un consiglio serio e spassionato: EVITA nel modo pi assoluto il contatto con quelle due sostanze, e se in casa tua qualcuno le utilizza, ESIGI che adoperi qualche prodotto in alternativa (ce ne sono moltissimi, in commercio, di altri detergenti altrettanto efficaci, sia per i pavimenti che per altro, ma SENZA ammoniaca; quanto alla candeggina, che la si utilizzi QUANDO TU NON SEI A CASA!); questo  l'unico modo, l'unico sistema utile per evitare quei fenomeni irritativi alla gola e agli occhi che hai descritto! Un ultimo consiglio: quando hai gli occhi rossi ed irritati per questo, NON STROFINARTELI MAI (perch il prodotto potrebbe cos penetrarvi pi all'interno), bens SCIACQUATELI CON ABBONDANTE ACQUA FREDDA (me l'ha detto un medico), capto? Spero di esser stata chiara ed esauriente. CIAO! Alice B.

Of course there is also the fabulous hosta that blooms only once, but the plant itself is as beautiful as a flower in my opinion.  One of my new favorites is the Hellebore.  It is a full shade evergreen that will flower in winter.  Also, there are some roses that do well in shade.  As long as you get at least 4 hours of sun you could add a lovely "New Dawn" rose which is a continuous blooming rambler.    Addition:  begonias and impatiens are not perennials, but begonias can be dug up and stored for the winter and replanted in the spring.  Impatiens are so inexpensive that you can fill a garden bed for next to nothing or just start them from seed.|`|8SyUHkPXaa	Marigolds, petunias, and pansies.|`|AA10604735	Shade perennials will not bloom all summer.

Fibrous Begonias may bloom in the shade you have described, but not very strongly there.  If your summers are cool enough, Pansies or Violas may be considered a perennial and bloom through the summer for you in that location.  If you want to try something different, bury Achimenes pots in your bed instead of actually planting them.  Let them grow and bloom until just before first frost in the Autumn, then dig up the pots and put them in the cellar or garage over winter.

The tv can go next to the lizard cage and you'll still have storage under all of that.

AA10288423	Not at all uncommon for Baquacil pools to develop water mold. Particularly in warm water areas. The company has tried for years to develop a system to combat water mold, without success. Once you get it, you're stuck. Symptoms include cloudy water. Shocking helps, but in just a few days it is cloudy again. Take an "eyeball" return fitting off and run your finger around the inside of the pipe, with the pump off. If you get some slimy stuff on your finger, then you have water mold. It is also inside the filter. Only solution is to convert to chlorine. After the conversion you can go back to Bacquacil if you like. TIP: Let the Baquacil level diminish before you start the conversion. You'll get through the "uglies" much faster that way.|`|AA10533955	my family owns a pool store and usually, those people that started using baquacil, usually only used it for about three years and then they started having problems that the chemical just could not get rid of and yes, almost all of them have now switched back to chlorine.      Our store is in Louisiana, and this is especially true if you live in an area with a warm climate.
VUNTunxiaa	Youre right; you do need the help of a qualified, licensed electrician.    The kitchen lighting circuit is not allowed to be shared with the counter top receptacles, so they should be working. The other wall receptacles may share the lighting circuit, you will know if they do by plugging a lamp into one of them.    The lighting circuit should not be GFCI protected, so the "Test/Reset" buttons should not be part of this equation, either.    In any situation like this, your best bet is to call a qualified, licensed electrical contractor. Trying to diagnose and repair electrical problems can be far out of the realm of most home owners; the same applies to the local "handyman", as well.    It could be as simple as a bad light switch or breaker; or, it could be a major safety issue. Have a licensed pro check it out ASAP.

Trying to diagnose and repair electrical problems can be far out of the realm of most home owners; the same applies to the local "handyman", as well.    Quite by accident, you have done a lot of what should be routine maintenance for your electrical system. The GFCI receptacles or circuit breakers should be tested at least once a month (most are marked "to be tested weekly"), you have "excercised" your circuit breakers by opening and closing them. This should be done twice a year.    Also, if your GFCI receptacles are more than 3 years old, they should all be replaced. Underwriters Labs, along with the International Association of Electrical Inspectors, and, I beleive, the National Fire Protection Association (the National Electrical Code is NFPA Publication NFPA 70), conducted a study two or three years ago (prior to or during the time that UL was developing a new Standard for GFCIs) that found that 82% of the GFCI devices then installed in people's homes no longer functioned to offer any protection. The "Test/Reset" buttons worked fine, the device just would not trip under "real world" fault conditions.

ce060a29a8e7cbb3f7cdc004ec90adc3aa	Oh my! You are going to have one heck of a wonderful garden for the next few years. Go ahead and till it as deeply as you can and make sure that you pulverize everything, nice and fine. The idea about the plastic over it, forcing the weeds to germinate and then killing the weeds should work perfectly. I am quite jealous of you. I wish I had a 50 year layer of well rotted manure to plant in. I have to import manure from my neighbor, which can be a real pain.    Oh, and if your cows never recieved a lot of antibiotics, that spot will produce wonderful organic produce. If so, then let it fallow for another two years and then your produce will qualify as 100% organic produce and you can sell it as such.

If there haven't been animals on it for a while, I am willing to bet the nitrogen has leached out. And check pH, for sure. Since you are using it this summer for planting, plow as early as you can, then spread clear plastic over it. What this does is encourage the weeds to germinate, and very happily, too! It's like a mini greenhouse. Then, when they are really happy(3 weeks or so) pull the plastic off- it's best if you get a good frost right after. It should kill the weeds that have come up, and fewer should germinate after you plant your garden. Good luck!

6O4WTiPQaa	A safety device on your water heater has gone bad, it's called a thermocouple.  It senses the heat off the pilot flame, sends a message back to the gas control valve telling it to keep sending gas to the pilot, because it's lit.

After a base coat has been applied you can use any type of latex paint to decorate it.     If it is wood, just use a latex interior gloss or semi gloss house paint.     No matter what the surface is, use a 150 grit sandpaper and lightly scuff the whole thing so the paint adheres properly.

Just be careful not to open it up too much or when you go to light it, the flame will be larger.  Only takes about 2 turns (if that).    As far as the light switch, maybe a mantel light, or may turn valve on to allow you to turn gas on.    Good luck|`|SzwG7scCaa	The best thing would be to look up the actual instructions and lighting diagram.  If there is a manufacturers name on the fireplace, go to their website and download the actual instructions.       Basically, there is a control key or knob and also a pilot ignitor.  (Its usually a red button hidden inside or under the fireplace)  Depress the ignitor repeatedly and turn the control knob or key to bring the gas and the spark together.  Once the pilot is lit, you can then use the wall switch to turn the unit on and off.  Sometimes its hard to find the pilot ignitor because its hidden inside, but the manufacturer should be able to help you locate it.  If you find your pilot, your control knob and your switch and it still wont lite, it is possible it was dissengaged at the gas line.  This is done often when a house is put on the market or sold.

AA11089392	There might be building and safety codes that prohibit this. The reason such codes exist is that extension cords are often too long or made of too small of wire. If your extension is no longer than needed to reach the receptacle and made of heavy enough wire it should be safe. It is also important to ensure that each plug connection makes a snug contact. Anything that causes too much resistance, long wire runs, insufficient wire size and poor connections create heat. Over time the heat can melt or harden the insulation, wear down the components in the appliance or, in extreme cases cause a fire.  If your appliances are covered by warranty you should check with the manufacturer. Some manufacturers may void the void the warranty if an extension is used.|`|AA10837912	The one very important stipulation that has not been mentioned here, is that the coiled extension lead, MUST be fully unwound from the reel.

rgVeUp8Saa	We were in a similar situation and after doing some research the most effective and cheapest way we found was the plastic shrink wrap.  Since we are normally not real good with do it yourself projects I have to admit, I was not looking forward to the process. I had the idea in my mind that it was going to be a difficult task, and that it would take all day! I was happily proven wrong! We finished the project in a few hours, and it ended up being a fun way to spend the afternoon.    Insulating the windows with plastic shrink wrap increases the R-value of the window as much as adding another pane of glass.  It makes a big difference!  The added barrier decreases drafts that come through the window, and keeps the frost from building up inside.     Here's how you do it. Everything you need should be available at the Hardware store:    ? Insulating plastic   ? Double stick tape (the kind made for this job)   ? Hair dryer   ? Extension chord   ? Rubbing alcohol   ? Paper towel    We bought our plastic and tape in a little kit for each window. They were cheap, only around $3, and extremely convenient. You can purchase the items separately as well.    Preparing the Window    The first step to applying the insulation is to prepare the window. Make sure that the storm window is closed, and that the window is locked securely. Then, clean the edges of the window with alcohol and a paper towel. Next, heat the windowpane, if it feels cold to the touch. Simply run the blow dryer along the windowpane for a few minutes.     Applying the Tape    Once the window is ready, apply the tape. Leave the backing on the tape, and apply the exposed edge to the wood. There are several ways to do this. You can apply the tape around the wood on the very edge of the window. This requires you to do an expert job of applying the plastic, otherwise you will have unsightly bubbles and creases. Another option is to apply it to the edge of the window trim, next to the wall. This creates a more invisible look. The choice is up to you, and will really depend on the way your window is designed.    Applying the Plastic    Next, remove the backing from the tape, and apply the plastic. This is where I thought the project was going to become tedious, but I was wrong! All you have to do is apply it to the plastic in a somewhat straight manner! You will want to leave a decent edge past the tape. This will get trimmed later, and gives you room for mistakes.    Finishing Touches    Once the plastic has been applied all the way around, step back and take a look. What you have will scare you! The plastic will look warped and wrinkled! Take a deep breath, because you are not quite done!    Now comes the fun part. Take your blow dryer, and use it to shrink the plastic. Run the blow dryer on a high setting, and start at the edges of your plastic. Keep it around a half of an inch from the surface of the plastic, and go around the entire outer edge of your window. Then work your way towards the middle of the window. You will be amazed as the wrinkles disappear from your plastic! (OK, maybe you won't be amazed, but I was! What can I say; I am easily entertained.)     Finally, trim the excess plastic from the edges. If you went around the edge of your window trim, by the window, use a knife blade to remove the excess. You will be thrilled with the difference this quick fix makes on your heating bill. And the best part is, you can barely see the plastic!     Good luck|`|YU1C3FUhaa	Get some really thick curtains! :)|`|04Te5gzzaa	You can go to Home Depot or Lowes and buy some plastic window insulation sheets.  It looks like a huge sheet of Saran Wrap.  You have to stick them around the edges of your window sill and then blow hot air using a hair dryer to shrink wrap the insulation film to form a tight seal.  That, in effect, creates a second pane against the cold air that might be seeping in.  You can also buy some nice thick fabric curtains that will help keep out the cold.  Make sure there are no gaps or cracks around your window sills that's letting cold air get into your home.  If there is, you can buy some silicone caulking and seal them up.|`|joiacDUdaa	Well, if it's winter where you live you can get some plastic insulator sheets from you local home improvement center..

Storm windows are an inexpensive option. You can buy them from a big box store. They are easy to install and will help in conjunction with curtains. They also make a window film you can install on the inside, sold at Lowe's in the hardware department near the weather stripping. It comes in common window sizes and is a shrink to fit product just install and heat with your hair drier until it becomes tight. These kits are cheap but disposable. The storm windows will run between 18.00 and 35.00 depending on the size. If you have the money and want to upgrade you can look at sash replacement kits for your current windows. They run between 110.00 and 200.00 depending on size and manufacture. They are easy to install and will come with insulated glass (Low-E argon gas if you want) . Hope you will find some of this useful.
NxOaNJ0Eaa	It may be Fungus gnats, which look like small flies. The larvae (maggots) of small gray flies tunnel into the soil and damage the roots. To get rid of these, first don't over water. This increases the chances of more eggs hatching. Place pieces of potato, about 1 1/2" big on top of the soil. The larvae will immediately go into the pieces of potato. Leave the pieces there for a few days, then throw away in the trash outside. If you leave it in your kitchen garbage, they will hatch and fly all over your kitchen. To reduce the number of flies flying around in your house, put yellow sticky cards or yellow fly paper around the plant. These can be found at home improvement stores or online. The flies love the color yellow and stick to the paper and die.   Always examine plants before buying them. Make sure the leaves are healthy, checking top and bottom of leaves for insects or blemishes. That the stems are healthy and not soft or rotting. And the roots are not coming out of the holes of the pot, which indicates that the plant has been in the pot for too long and may be stunted.   Or it could be whiteflies, which look more like tiny moths than flies.   I included two links for you, first one is for fungus gnats and the second is for whiteflies. They have alot of info and also have pictures so you can find which one is your unwanted house-pest. Good luck! Happy Gardening!|`|YaeG1cjhaa	Sounds like fungus gnats. Probably too much water.

You made need to move some of the paper along with a putty knife.    Once the paper is off, gently sand the walls, then prime before painting.|`|80PpnBUAaa	Your not going to like this answer.  No-one ever does.  But I've been removing and hanging wallpaper for over 20 years.  My kids are even experts.  What it takes is patience, patience patience.      You will need a scraper, spray bottle of water and time.  My teenagers and I just removed two bedrooms and a bathroom covered in wallpaper.    First try removing the top layer of wallpaper from the wall.  This usually involves catching a small pieces of the top layer and pulling.  This is the easy part.  What is left behind is usually the backing from the paper.  (sometimes if you are really lucky the paper will come right off, backing and all)  You don't want to rip the backing from the wall dry, this will ultimately rip the wallboard and you'll be patching for days.    Now for the fun, get that spray bottle and soak the backing that is still stuck on the wall.  (this is where all those fancy, and more expensive than water products will work - but why bother, water is cheap enough)    The water penetrates through the backing and loosens the glue.  You then begin pulling the backing - sometimes scraping and often pulling the backing in large pieces right off the wall.  However, sometimes there are small pieces of backing left on.  (continually spray and keep the section you are working on saturated)  Once you have the walls relatively clear of backing you then wash the remaining glue, and any other small pieces of backing from the wall.  You are now ready to patch any small tears in your wallboard.  Prime and paint.    Have fun.  Be patient.  Its boring, its boring, its boring.  But when your done, don't every wallpaper again without a good wallpaper primer under the paper - this makes removing the paper a dream.    Have fun.  p.s. Don't follow any instructions that talk about scoring the paper and then trying to soak it with products.  Scoring always end up scoring (or tearing) the wallboard - what a mess to fix.

I know you can use the microwave to zap the germs that love to live in them, but for how long?  -- Diana Biles, Cedar Falls, IA      AnswerPutting sponges in the microwave can be chancy -- microwave ovens vary in power, and the size of the sponge affects how long you need to zap it to kill germs. So I can't recommend this method.    But I can offer a way to sanitize sponges, endorsed by the Soap and Detergent Association: Place them in a solution of 1 gallon water and 3/4 cup household bleach (or 1 quart water to 3 tablespoons bleach), let soak for five minutes, then air-dry.    Sponges should be cleaned in dishwashing detergent and hot water after each use and allowed to air-dry to prevent bacteria from multiplying. You can also wash them in the dishwasher along with your dishes. Place them in the utensil caddy or clip them to the top rack with a clothespin. Be careful when you remove them; they may be hot.    Sponges last for only two to eight weeks, depending on how frequently and roughly they're used. Look for sales and stock up, as I do|`|j0pJ6td8aa	You can try running them through the dishwasher.|`|ek1SLjl0aa	some one shared with me to put the sponge in the microwave for 3 minutes that will work|`|8SPM7jDkaa	bleach will kill alot of the bacteria. you could also use a spray like lysol that will kill the bacteria and also make the sponge smell better. if you already nuked it for 3 mins, it should be sanitized.|`|27cJ0rehaa	Yes I have heard the microwave trick too, but just make sure it has water in it so it doesn't burn.

ww12lItvaa	Store bought filters contain activated charcoal that absorb chemicals like chlorine, fluorine, and others.  Once the charcoal has absorbed all it can it is done. It no longer works.     One other reason, told to me by someone that sells filters, is that there are anaerobic bacteria that will live on charcoal. Since the charcoal removes the chlorine that would normally kill it. Thus an old filter can grow stuff.       But monthly sounds excessive. I know most people only change a filter for refrigerator a few times a year if that.     If this is a whole home filter for a well that is different.     Good Luck.|`|03sLrNPCaa	In addition to the anti microbe additive expiring in your store bought water filter, every filter, air, water, fuel, oil, beer, all of them, will continue to fill those gaps until the liquid flow is stopped.  Every filter needs to be changed or cleaned eventually unless there is a back flow feature in the system. The reason an engine oil filter quits cleaning is because when it plugs a by pass opens and lets the oil continue to flow, dirt and all.|`|SKqV374maa	it's the same as an oil filter  when it gets old and full of dirt it stops cleaning|`|AA10243353	It seems to be important to know what the water is being used for.  If it's for human consumption, I would imagine the filters over time start picking up undesirable stuff like sludge and bacteria which will only wind up contaminating the water you are trying to filter.  Yucky filters = yucky water.  Keep your filters fresh and clean.

It's now standard as 4"    If you want to measure using your hand,  take a ruler and measure the width of your palm,  right across the heart line,  or between the two bones you can feel on the sides of your hand.  It'll be roughly 3-4".  Now, if you can just remember that number, you'll have a way to measure anything.  Roughly.    Say the measurement for your hand was 3":  If you put your hands together side by side on the screen,  palms down,  keeping your thumbs out of the way,  you'll have 6".  Move your right hand over to the other side of the left one,  and you'd get 9".  Then move the left one next to the right,  you'll get 12".  Just keep doing that and you'll get an idea of how big the screen is.    And always measure from corner to corner on a TV or computer screen.  All the best.|`|SKqV374maa	you can use a computer but you can't read a tape|`|AhO0Uoppaa	measure diagonally from corner to corner, eg if its 16.8 inches or something it will be a 17" as some of the screen may be behind the casing.

MNl2HmXRaa	For Laundry  The easiest way:    Pour Clorox? Regular-Bleach (scented or regular) into your bleach dispenser. If you don't have a dispenser, simply pour in Clorox? Regular-Bleach (scented or regular) along with your detergent as your washing machine fills with water. Use ? cup for a standard washer, 1 ? cup for an extra large washer. Add clothes after agitation has begun.  For best results:    Add detergent as washer fills.        * Then add clothes.      * After clothes are thoroughly wet and machine has agitated for 5 minutes, add bleach that's been diluted with one quart of water.      * Avoid pouring solution directly onto fabric.      * Adding diluted bleach after detergent has dissolved delivers a slightly brighter wash load.    Pre-soaking with Clorox? Regular-Bleach:    Use ? cup Clorox? Regular-Bleach per gallon of cool water. Submerge entire garment and soak for 5 minutes. Wash immediately using detergent and ? cup Clorox? Regular-Bleach.    To hand-wash, disinfect or pre-treat stains and clean heavy soils, rinse to remove loose soil and fully soak each garment for 5 minutes in a solution of ? cup of Clorox? Regular-Bleach to 1 gallon of cool water.    To disinfect or sanitize laundry, add ? cup of Clorox? Regular-Bleach to a standard size washer following the laundry use directions.    To kill bacteria [Staphylococcus aureus (Staph.)/ Klebsiella pneumoniae] in laundry, add ? cup of Clorox? Regular-Bleach to a standard size washer following the laundry use directions.    To disinfect and deodorize diapers pails, soak in ? cup of Clorox? Regular-Bleach to 1 gallon of water for 5 minutes.|`|PkauhFMwaa	Soak your white shirts in hot water with a nice splash of the clorox bleach for about 20 min.  Then wash it in a washing machine, with your regular whites. You can also put a little bit of bleach in the washing machine...where you put the soap there should be a place to put bleach. If not, put a splash in with the load of laundry, as long as the other whites don't have a small amount of colour...otherwise they will be bleached fully.

Amadeus is perfect for stainless (mica flakes & reflective).  Some cherry cabinets could look a little orange with the Amadeus or flat and dark.

Now you should read 110 from either white or black to the ground screw, which is basically one wire carries 110 to one of the elements and the other wire to the other element. Make sure your connections are good and covered especially if any of the wires are stranded type. Try turning the Thermostat on the heater itself down a bit, never turn it on high heat anyway. Maybe the breaker has gone bad itself, make sure the water heater is rated for 220 volt too just in case. Dont always trust a salesman. Also make sure the black and white run to a 220 breaker in the panel|`|AR2lbLwQaa	I am thinking that your 2 elements are on at the same time instead of them alternating.  Most if not all water heaters have the top (4500watts) element come on first and when the thermostat is satisfied it switches the power to the lower thermostat and that element (4500watts) comes on.  If you have a 30amp 2 pole breaker feeding the heater you cannot have both elements on at the same time.  Your connections are OK if connected as you stated.  Some people answer electrical questions and have no knowledge of  electricity.  You are OK.  If the elements are not in paralell then you have a shorted circuit.|`|Fg5tymz1aa	The water heater is connected to the service panel box via a 240V circuit breaker.  You should read 120V between each wire and ground, and 240 volts between the two wires.  Each hot wire via the breaker is connected to different poles in the panel box which gives you the 240V.  Since voltages fluctuate because of demand you might read from 110-120 volts.  In theory there should be 120V from each wire to ground.  Never turn on the breaker until all connections are made securely and properly.

KoOasFpmaa	Yes, it's most likely that Collect is free, and the 5.00 is just for postage should you choose that option instead. eBay can be a little confusing sometimes when listing, and it's easy to put things in a less than obvious order.    However, some eBayers - especially traders - will sometimes charge a handling charge for collections (although this is rare to be honest).    You're doing the right thing by asking the seller for clarification.    One thing to check, is the shipping cost listed anywhere else at a different price? If so, then it's more likely that this 5.00 charge is for collection, as the shipping cost is independently listed too.    If not, or it's also set at 5.00, then you've most likely got nothing to worry about.|`|d28ead87dee9c8e7b5121045804837c5aa	Insults I like to use are SMACKTARD and DIMWIT.    this in no way applies to you.|`|3506016d5289004b41bda212dadfdc4caa	Well I guess you wait until they email you back with the answer.

SS42sGYRaa	There appears to be a bit of controversy about the cause of the mould in some answers - it is caused by a build up of damp - which is due to condensation.  This, in turn is caused by lack of ventilation.  Double glazing is notorious for it - older glazing units did not have vents in them, and together with the type of house they were fitted in - caused huge problems all over the country - you need to ventilate your rooms - either by the simple expedient of opening a window a little, or unblocking fireplaces, ventilation bricks, and so on - remember that we humans breathe a lot of moisture into the air - pints of it a day - and it all has to go somewhere - if there is no ventilation in the room, it builds up and condenses against the windows and close to the floor where the walls are colds ( so called Rising Damp - which is a complete fraud, by the way!)  The continuous damp on the window causes mould - you need to sort out the cause before you can solve the mould..   Also, consider the fact that old double glazed units are almost certainly NOT working now - they leaked shortly after manufacture, and almost certainly are not gas or vacuum filled any more - so arent working as double glazing any more.|`|pq8spEdxaa	hi    I suggest you get a quote from a professional and get their advice about possible heath problems    this will give you ammo to throw at your landlord|`|Au0HK3O6aa	Paint Tea Tree Oil on to the frames.

cXCnszhPaa	If you have high humidity levels and keep your house really warm with little or no air exchange from outside to inside you will grow mould rapidly.  If you live in an area where it dips to -20 or more and there is inadequate vapor barrier between wallboard and insulation you can grow mould due to the moisture condensing where the cold hits warm.|`|Gd4f7VD1aa	What side of the house are these rooms?

Moisture carried in the air (from us humans mainly - we lose lots of water when we breathe - pints of it each day) will condense on the coldest spots - USUALLY windows and down near the floor (heat rises), but in your case it may be something as simple as a little hole or gap in the soffit where cold air is able to get under the roof and cool the ceiling down.|`|Vyz5YnZqaa	Do you have snow or ice on the roof?

YaeG1cjhaa	If you're doing a project on compost and fertilizer I might suggest that you do a comparison of plants (try tomatoes) planted with the same fertilizer but add compost to the mix of half and record their growth and fruit set. The problem with with comparing compost and fertilizer is that you will never be able to get a fair comparison because composts, containing fertilizers are never the same and to get a constant you will need to have identical NPK ratios. The thing about composts is that they supply nutrients like fertilizers but they also supply organic matter and microbes that help the plants take up the nutrients from fertilizers.   As a side note, we did organic fert compared to chemical for the science project and turns out that the plants couldn't tell the difference between chemical and organic.|`|6pUzzsuhaa	plants need a good balance of compost and fertilizer.. really more compost than fertilizer- applying too much fertilizer can cause the plants to produce small fruits/veggies/flowers, it can also make the plant just grow and grow with out producing anything.   compost is more natural than fertilizers are because as things decompose, they release nutrients back into the soil and they create 'dirt' too|`|944iJNAdaa	Your YA profile says you're 18, and looking for a blonde chick.

q2tT8ecraa	I hate to say this and I speak from experience - get rid of some of the clothes that you haven't worn in a while.  Chances are you will not miss them.      Buy some of those wheeled-flat storage bins (the kinds for gift wrap) to store things you don't use very often (winter clothes in summer, etc.)  You can fit a few of those under your bed.    For your closet buy some of those hanging cloth shelves and stick them in there.  They will offer you a place to put underwear, socks, t-shirts, and other things that fold easily.

69uizI7Naa	Hi there...     Here we go LOL     Leaving the ceiling white is outdated as is the "popcorn" sprayed ceilings.... Why are you using beige on the walls - try using colors to brighten the room - also not all the walls have to be the same color....     For example:    a living room...    Let's say you have a brown couch, wood furniture, and some sunflower pictured pillows... You could:    Paint the 3 walls sunflower yelllow and one burnt orange - this could be the accent wall - perhaps where the fireplace is so it's a focal point.... with a beige ceiling (not stark white it's too much contrast) - don't mix too many colors and then the ceiling too - it makes a room look small    You can play with color to make rooms wider or longer.....    Also ceiling colors to make your room appear taller or wider....     You can tie your room together by taking a look at your existing furniture, drapery, pillows for inspiration for the wall colors... just remember if you put dark colors on the walls then choose a light ceiling... And if you choose a dark ceiling then light walls  or you'll dwarf your room....     Ask a local paint store for ideas.... they usually have free pamphlets with pictures and ideas ;)|`|ghi9atKVaa	white ceilings make the room look taller.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Painting the ceiling white is the norm, but as of late I've been seeing painting the ceiling the same colour as the wall.

Tvcn83Adaa	more than likely the counter top is not already painted, and is made of some kind of cheap synthetic material.  Painting will make it a bigger mistake than just some hair dye.      If it is painted, sand the top down and re-paint it, just remember even if it is white all white looks different, and you'll have to sand and paint the whole thing to make it look right.    Coat the stain with Tide (powder make a paste).  Tide works far better than any other detergent I've tried.

gFHTcIc8aa	Find a flashlight and go to the breaker box in your house.    You probably tripped a breaker.    When inside the breaker box, you should see one of the breaker levers in the middle position.    Push this breaker arm back to the direction all the other breakers levers are facing.    Once this is done lights should come back on.|`|pjGueC4xaa	You need to locate your circuit breaker box, and rest the breaker.  The one that tripped will be in a different position then the rest.|`|owMQ8jTcaa	The others sound like they are on the right track. To reset the breaker you must first unplug the vacuum. Then go to the breaker box find the one that is in the half way position (some newer ones will have a little red indicator that will show). Once found, move it to the OFF position. Then move it to the ON position, this may take a little more force then your normal light switch.|`|xSO5kxuiaa	Very easy to fix!  Find your breaker box and look at the breakers.  The breaker that is in the middle is the one that "tripped"  Shut it off and turn it back on and your lights will come back on.  If you have fuses you will have to buy one at a hardware store.

And yes, just the shower enclosure is fine.|`|Tvcn83Adaa	You'll need to do the cement board around the shower and a bit further out, the other walls should be fine with green board...don't forget the liner for the shower bottom.  It is very important, since grout really is not water tight.  When in doubt have a licensed plumber install that, it is cheaper than having a water leak and having to take everything out to start over.

I asked him if these were better than most and he truthfully told they weren't really but you could get separate parts for these whereas if one little thing went on most other makes you had to buy a whole new unit. I didn't quite get the cheapest one but I took his advice. My Indesit is sometimes on 3 times a day.

AA10590885	It is not quite that simple - you have to contain the water so it does not seep into the ground. There is black rubber sheeting that is used to line ponds - this can be used to create your stream bed - with the water running into a catch basin (you can use the same sheeting or you can buy a small pond liner at a home store). You would set your pump in this catch pond and pipe it back up to the beginning of the stream.  Water runs down hill so there needs to be at least a slight incline to your design.. I encourage you to visit a pond store or research pond books at the library.  The stream design is much easier to maintain than a koi pond or deep pond.

9Fa3hfUAaa	1st document everything. Get a file folder and start collecting. Get a copy of the the plans the engineers used for the cities building permit. They should be more than happy to back up their design with documents, becasue ultimatly if this guy sues you, you could sue the engineers.     2nd If you got a permit that means the city saw some sort of plan(the one you should get from the engineer) and signed off on it. They know what the are doing, Get any documents from the city in regards to your building permit.

I know you hired professionals, but they make mistakes sometimes. Sometimes they do what is easiest for them, and they don't really care how it affects your neighbors. That's why they should have insurance.    If those you hired caused a problem for your neighbor, it becomes your problem, too.  Your neighbor is also stressed out, and the water isn't headed towards your basement.   Go outside and take a look around.  Before the company that did the work comes back, go talk to the neighbor and ask him to show you where the problems are so you can point them out to the engineer.  Your neighbor will appreciate your concern about his property.
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	The roundish thing is a set screw.  You'd need a hex-headed Allen wrench of the same size to remove it.    Edit-  Okay, that means it's stripped out.  There's a few things you can do.  1) Just drill the set screw out which will destroy the handle, but you could purchase a new one fairly cheap and it will come with an Allen wrench to fit it.  2) Try and remove the stripped screw with an "easy-out" or other tool for removing stripped screws. I've used many different kinds and some work better than others. And I'm sorry, but I can't for the life of me remember what the name of the best one is...It came in a green colored plastic and it was the type that you use with an electric screwdriver. You just drill the screw with one end, then flip it around and remove the screw with the other end. It's designed to be used in the reverse setting. Works like a charm. Don't use the Craftsman "Screw-Out;" waste of money.  Of course you'd have to replace the set screw. Don't try to re-use it!  3) Pull out the old wash-tub and back scrubber...kidding.    Edit II-  Are you using metric sized Allen wrenches?  Or SAE sized?  They are two different sizes...    Best of luck to you.
L8zmQS8Jaa	For several years, I grew plants, very well, with fluorescent lighting (a "shop light" fixture ) plugged into a 24 hour timer.  I gave them food, water, and just over 12 hours of light each day to produce a jungle.  Some fixtures don't come with plugs on them.  It will be helpful to find one that has it already if you are not comfortable with installing it yourself.      Some plants like light with more red in it.  For them you can get "grow light" bulbs.  These come in 2 flavors, incandescent or fluorescent.  I wouldn't try leaving a heat lamp on plants that you like for any length of time.|`|pq8spEdxaa	hi    you can fit the light as you describe but don't plants need sunlight not artificial light?|`|d0d7b35a707f98e4d94fb32cc3b60b5baa	You need grow lights, not fluorescent.

Pepper plants huh?|`|lQDwrNISaa	the best way for you to do this is to use low energy grow lamps. try eco-light/ envirolite or maxibright bulbs.(just google it) they start at 125watts which are equal in strength to a 600watt high pressure sodium(h.p.s.) grow light. low energy bulbs screw into a e40 light fitting and simply plug into the socket. h.p.s. bulbs require a separate ballast resistor.  if you want to grow plants you will need a bulb with a light output of 6400k.(blue). this will need to be on for about 16-18hrs a day. if you want your plant to produce flowers then you simply change the bulb for a 2700k(red) output and reduce the on time to 12hrs on and 12 hrs off. these bulbs look like a big version of your household low energy bulb. bulbs cost around 20 each, 5 for the light fitting(e40 screw in)  low energy bulbs dont give of too much heat so you can have them closer to your plants and in a confined space.ideal for a closet.  try your local hydroponics shop for equipment. you can also find the bulbs and fittings  i mentioned on ebay
b663010fec563a8838443a18a6bec461aa	There are a few types of steel doors.  1) Actual solid steel doors (not filled, but hollow with foam insulation inside). These are used primarily for commercial use. Very secure, very expensive, and most difficult installation.  2) Steel clad doors. These are regular doors with a thin steel veneer. Easily dented.  3) Steel (or other metal) storm door. These attach to the doorjamb and provide a tight fit. Usually has removable glass panels to let air in. Best for keeping out bugs.  4) Steel (or other metal) security door. These are the doors that have the bars on them. No protection from flying bugs, but will keep out intruders; or in your case, keep them in!  5) Steel (or other metal) screen doors. These are your everyday swinging screen door meant to keep out bugs.|`|ip5EWw7uaa	Most door suppliers will do these or security companies but they are expensive.

If you are trying to change out the door only, this can be done, but be careful to buy a door that is compatible with the current frame.
tVB1kbFIaa	well are they too hard to hammer in a nail, or to screw in a screw? in which case they are probably concrete. id say use a drill with a masonry bit, you can pick them up at any hardware store, drill in a small pilot hole, get yourself something called a 'masonary screw' and screw that on in there. done!    if it's too heavy for the screw, you'll need to buy a 'molly' which will secure it in place better.    if you still can't drill the hole rent a 'hammer drill' and that will get the job done. make sure your using masonry screws though.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	i am guessing you probably have a manufactured house. the one i had some of the walls had steel parts in them to help sturdy them during transportation. what i did was drilled a first and then screw the screw into it. another option is using the picture hanger stuff that 3M makes.
4bc5b87ed73962c0f8d5a68384af5d86aa	Use KILZ or KILZ 2 water-base on the walls with crayon and marker....possibly two coats to hide them. Forget using sprayed on KILZ. for spots...do the whole wall with a roller. Washing them down with TSP might help also. Use a tinted primer on the other walls that are very different in color from the new paint. Priming with white primer will alter the finish shade of color so it's best to prime with something tinted to the final color. If you prime any areas, you need to prime the whole wall otherwise the sheen may differ from the primed to non-primed areas...especially in sunlight. If you spackle any areas, it's also best to prime the whole wall since the spackle will accept paint differently than the rest of the wall. I always trim the edges, windows, doors and corners first, then roll the walls as tight to the edge as possible to leave a clean rolled edge that's perhaps a 1/2 inch out from the edge or corner and you still may wind up with a slightly different shade in the corners and edges since brushed-on paint and rolled-on paint look slightly different. There are also rollers available to do edging and inside corners as well so there will be no brush strokes and slight color differences from trimming with a brush. I don't tape around doors and windows...painting a straight line along the edges is pretty easy after a little practice, patience and care. Don't forget to "box" the new paint if more than 1 gallon is being used in a room or area. "Boxing: means that all the paint for one room or area needs to be mixed in a large container like a 5 gallon pail to keep the color the same since one gallon of fresh paint may differ slightly from the next.  And always roll on paint in a "W" pattern to prevent "tiger stripes"....keep the edges wet from one section to the next.|`|Onrr7liJaa	For your primer question, it wouldn't hurt to just get your color and do a little area to see how well it covers before you buy the Kilz.   I have had a spray bottle of kilz before and I got it at Lowes or Walmart.  For the crayon/marker, try a Magic Eraser, it'll do wonders and you shouldn't need to prime it.  If you don't want to fool with that, then use your spray primer just where you need it.  I wouldn't prime anything unless your test spot shows that it will need lots of coats.  If you do decide to prime a room that is going from light to dark, have them tint the prime with something dark otherwise it'll still take a load of paint to cover.  You can do walls or trim first whichever you want.  It'll be tedious either way!

LATER  My son was telling me that he even does flue gas analysis.|`|BBCD94sUaa	you should have it cleaned not burning properly!|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	Your boiler has the wrong ratio of air  which is causing the sooting up. Get it set properly as you are burning the wrong mixture.

They are pumping a LOT of money into the system, so that's bound to have some effect, but people don't spend much money on housing unless they're feeling pretty comfortable about the future, and that's not due anytime soon - instead, the numbers are still going downhill, with more people laid off every month.      Can you contract some side jobs, and still keep your sales job until things pick up?  That might be best for now, and financially safest, too.
VFmmVHGVaa	That's an old plow,and i can usually find anything if its out there ,but had no luck.You might consider using heavy angle iron of the same height as the spades.You will have to cut it to length and drill holes but it should work as a replacement,unless your trying to restore to original.hope this helps.  t|`|pq8spEdxaa	hi    search google or ebay
A7m8DFgkaa	That's cool that you don't want her to smell the smoke.  You could try an aerosol called "ozium"  it's usually in the automotive section.  The original has a very light lemony/citrus scent and it does a GREAT job of eliminating odors.    Then, I guess you could smoke outside until she goes home.    You are a good granddaughter.....pat yourself on the back for me, ok??|`|Dx6dsQx1aa	Most grocery and drug stores carry natural citrus air freshener spray such as Pure Citrus or Blue Magic.  But Febreze might have a more permanent effect.  Get the carpets professionally cleaned, if you can.  That is the biggest source of cigarette odor.  And stop smoking inside!|`|Tvcn83Adaa	You are not going to get rid of the smell 100%.    Start by replacing the filters in your heating system before she arrives, and don't smoke in the house after they are changed.    Clean all bedding, curtains and fabric in the house.    Wet clean all the carpet and furniture in the house.    Wash the pillows on your guest bed, they will hold a lot of the smell.    Going extreme, you can paint the walls and ceiling to really remove some of the smell.|`|sAuB8vLCaa	Try a thorough cleaning and washing the walls, a lot of smoke smells stick to the wall, and ceiling. Wash everything u can curtains, pillows, throw covers, everything. Buy ur self some candles, they come w/a warming plate with the candle, plug it in and u have a nice scent. There not a fire hazard either. Scents to get are clean Linen, Vanilla.    Best of Luck to ya.|`|eeRLckg5aa	It takes a while after you quit smoking in the house, for the smell to go away. You could wash all curtains and blankets. Febreze all the furniture and shampoo the carpets. The only thing I've found to really work well is an air purifier. If you get a good one($$) you could get rid of the smell in a few days.|`|O0VQqIkDaa	Febreeze works well and also if you have carpet you can put arm & hammer baking soda on the carpet, let it stay for about 24 hours, and then vacuum it up.  Works well.|`|vXe4dehRaa	Febreze.|`|6mKm3iQ4aa	Cigarette smoke, unfortunately, gets into the fibers of furniture and carpeting, so you won't be able to get rid of it completely.      If it were me, I'd Febreze everything completely.  Let it dry and Febreze it again and repeat and repeat.    You could also get the scented oil warmer plug-in things.  Virtually everyone makes them these days.  I like the Air Wick ones best.    Open all the windows and let the place air out, too.  I know it's cold, but just a couple of hours would help.
