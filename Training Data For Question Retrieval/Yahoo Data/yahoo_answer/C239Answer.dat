8Z7Nnr8zaa	ask away ;) i'll let you anything/everything you wanna know about the wild thang...   as for your condoms question, there's directions on any box of condoms that you purchase, that tell you what to do... pinch the tip (not hard, just enough pressure to keep it between your fingers) and slide it down the shaft, and it should fit snug and ever so slightly pressured tight ;) you may have to play around with different sizes, there's extra small- extra large, you have to find the size that fits you (that fits you when you're hard, not soft. your penis is significantly increased in size when you're turned on)    How to put on a condom- the wet side goes on the OUTside, and the dry side rests on the inside with your wang... google CONDOM INSTRUCTIONS and go to IMAGES and there's illustrated drawings of how to effectively put on a condom     as for pregnancy, you don't have to be freaked out by the possibility, you just have to be SAFE about sex.. that means your penis doesn't even get NEAR a chick's vagina without a condom on.. if during sex you feel the condom break, pull out immediately and check for leakage.. if you're not sure, be safe and slip on a new one ;) If your girl's on the pill, even better.. now you've got 2 things working against pregnancy! but if you use the condom right , like how i explained above, then you should be a-okay ;)    as for how to move, underneath all the nervousness there's wild testosterone waiting to rip through >;) so let it... some people recommend doing a shot to calm the nerves, but be careful, you gotta be sure you don't get drunk or you may end up with someone you're not too crazy about, AND you could get too drunk to f*ck, meaning you can't get hard because you're too relaxed from the alcohol.. so if anything, do a single shot just to take the nerve's edge off a bit... once you're with the girl you want to lose it to, and you're in the moment, if she's nervous, take it slow and ease into her slowly (some girls get really nervous and clench up, making it harder for the penis to go in) but if she's not nervous, then you can go right in without easing, and get crazy :) thrust in and out with your hips, hold onto her hips or you can get on top for more leverage control.. if you let the girl you're with know that you're a virgin, if she's the right chick for you then she'll be patient and work with you through it, and kind of tell you what to do ;)    like i said, if you're curious about anything, you can e-mail me, whatever you want ;) i'll get back to you|`|3HWV0AkKaa	i kno im only 14 but...please wait for the right person. the person you love and want to spend the rest of your life with. that is the most meaningful thing a guy could do is save yourself for the person you love. i kno i sound crazy but that is what im looking for in a guy. someone who is not gonna jus throw that special moment away becuz you were horny. jus masturbate!!!!!!|`|NYJgiVxraa	wait until you are ready. so many people screw themselves over when they are not ready. you are doing the right thing by waiting. because whenever you do have sex, there is ALWAYS a possibility of becoming pregnant.|`|dXDroPtfaa	If you are "stupid" When it comes to sex then apparently, you are not ready.  Wait till you grow up.|`|dIxQ9rV5aa	NOT stupid.    Just not ready.  You'd probably be much happier in a faithful marriage.    If you get laid for the sake of getting laid, all you'll have to offer a prospective wife is a prospective husband who has been known to get laid with someone he isn't married to, just for the sake of getting laid.|`|laLW1Krwaa	There is no right way|`|pHIUUnOiaa	guess what you are only 18 years old sex is for the woman/man of your dreams somebody that you really love you are not ready for sex|`|7x9lvbhAaa	OMG you don't know how to put a condom just put you suff in the condom....duh|`|GGH0HVdvaa	When the time comes *snort* you'll know.... *wink*|`|DN9RZHi3aa	1. buy a condom  2. take it out of the thing  3. out it on your dIck  4.dont put it on completely, leave a smidge on the top, or else it will break  5. get a girl|`|95o30mmnaa	well for one im happy you waited for sex  and two im glad you are asking questions before just winging it  use a condom and roll it on softly   i guess it takes practice  the best way not to get a girl pregnant is not to have sex
IVSqQQzlaa	None of my babies had any consitipation while breastfed.  I think it's unusual but not unheard of.  My babies did, however, have the odd constipation problems on formula.  I often used the glycerine suppositories.    You can try to give him a warm bath and gently massage his abdomen while he's in the bath.      There is a similar question that was asked not too long ago tonight and someone posted a link for a page from Dr. Sears that had some good suggestions.    Good luck - I hope your poor baby boy gets over this problem soon!|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u need to talk to his doc now; bf babies should not be that constipated especially on a regular basis; my dd is ff and she's never been that constipated|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	this is not constipation- in fact it's fine bowel movements. sounds like he's gotten use to people "helping" him poop and doesn't know how to use those muscles well himself. a knowlegale doctor would have informed you better. breastfed babies can go over a week without a bowel movement. only hard pellet like poops indicate constiaption, not the lack of poop  he's has become dependent on you helping him go  http://www.kellymom.com/newman/04enough_...     you can read more|`|3klIx1Egaa	try drinking more water in your diet, so it ups the volume in your breast milk, should give it a kick start :)|`|ntdGOZqGaa	Actually a little bit of water would help him, just like an oz a day. My son was 2 months and had a problem with having a BM too and I would give him an oz of water a day and that helped so much. If you dont want to do that then you should get more suppository|`|F8iyUqJBaa	What is in your diet.  I know I had to change my diet dramatically from pregnancy to nursing because my son had such terrible gas.  I would suggest that maybe you add some fiber to your diet and some dandelion root (they come in capsules and you can find them at health food stores).|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Talk to your doctor or your lactation professional.  Maybe you could add some food/drinks to your diet that will help him.|`|iAGzyzRWaa	usually breastfed baby's shouldn't be having these problems, you can try changing your diet, if you are eating lots of iron filled foods that could pass to the baby and be causing him problems, I put Vaseline on his but and around his butt hole to kinda help my son but if the problem continues I would take him back to the doc. I know where you are coming from hope this helps good luck|`|AA11625299	actually you should talk to your doctor, and if they are over a month old they will probably recommend juice, its probably something in your diet that is causing your baby constipation...usually dairy...anyways I am not a doctor...thats who you need to talk to|`|77b1dc8e9ba4f99da65a538c28e739c3aa	At two months it's safe to give him like 1oz pear juice 1oz water. My girls had problems and that's what the doc told me to do. juices that are ok at that age are pear and apple/prune baby juices only.|`|3CG3rby0aa	It is not normal for a baby to have problems like that.  Especially since he is breastfeed that usually makes pooping easier.  I would talk to your child's doctor and tell them what is going on and see what they say.  Ask if there are any natural ways to help your boy poop without having to help him.  I wish you the best of luck!  Hope things get better soon. :)
vOFdHvlvaa	Yes they come in other sizes and yea they come in wide mouth.  The plastic bottles come in size 2, 4 and 8 ounces.  The wide mouth bottles come in 4 and 8 ounces.  The glass bottles come in 4 and 8 ounces.    Here's the site were i got those sizes from:  http://www.handi-craft.com/products/bott...     I use them and still burped my son when he was a lil younger (hes almost 8 months old now and doesnt need it anymore), but not sure burpin is as necessary with these bottles as they are with other bottles but I still think its better to burp them just in case.    Heres a site were they explain it a lil better than I could.  http://www.handi-craft.com/products/bott...    Hope this helps, :D.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u always burp your baby no matter what kind of bottle you use until they can burp themselves|`|gx4s68s8aa	I don't know about wide mouth (don't think so though) But I know they come in a four oz.    You still have to burp your baby, but they make it so that there is less gas left in the stomach after the necessary burp.  I used them with my daughter and they really seemed to help her gas.|`|c23e2e9ba321447351d3dc720a353187aa	They do come in wide mouth but I'm not sure if they still make the 4 oz ones.  They also make glass ones in 3.5 and 7 oz sizes and little bitty 2 oz ones.      Yes, you still need to burp your son.  they are just designed to "help" keep air out but of course some air will always end up in babies tummy.    Edit: yeah, the 2 oz bottles have teh same vent, just smaller.|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	2 oz, 4 oz, and 8 oz sizes only.  No wide mouths. Sorry.  They help reduce air bubbles (to help reduce colic, spit-up, burping and gas).   you may or may not have to burp your baby after (you probably will, but who knows)|`|TVC3mAP7aa	I don't believe they come in wide mouth, but they do come in 4 oz sizes.  The 4 oz ones came in a starter pack that I picked up at Wal Mart (I believe it had 3-8 oz bottles and 2-4 oz bottles).      At 5 months old, I probably wouldn't burp a baby after using them, but it really depends on how active your baby is.  The more active a baby is, the more gas will naturally work it's way out of baby's system.      The bottles do two things, 1) prevent the nipple from collapsing as baby drinks and 2) prevent bubbles from forming in the liquid.  Both prevent the baby from swallowing air and reduce gas.|`|zwctZ812aa	I have 6 ounce dr. browns bottles.  Those are the only size I have seen at the stores where I'm at.  They are used to cut down on air swallowed, but you will always need to burp a bottle fed baby no matter what bottles you are using.  THe Dr. Browns are just good for gassy babies because the less air they swallow, the less likely they are to have gas.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	This is the only bottle we have ever used. I am not sure exactly what wide mouth means, I think you mean a larger nipple? Which they do. I bought a short squat 8 oz that has a huge nipple on it and my son hates it. I thought we were doomed with the small 4oz because of the smaller nipple he liked, and I thought we'd have to refill 2-3 times a feeding. However, I just discovered the 8oz with a small nipple-yeah! Yes I still burp him and he's 7 months...so now that you ask it..I guess I don't get the point of them either if you still have to burp! Since I have never tried other bottles, maybe it really does help with gas. He never really has had a spit up problem, I guess I don't know if it's him or his bottles?|`|rAkWoweOaa	They have the large ones at Walmart. Wide mouth/sippy cup.
ASH6fsmoaa	Yes, they still do sometimes and my youngest just turned 3! It gets better with time. I couldn't wait to get rid of the granny panties and just deal with the occasional irritation!|`|ggETPqedaa	I still have to wear underwear that goes above my incision line and especially in the bitter cold we are having, it hurts like hell at times. My c-section was done December 6. However, the doctor says it looks great. Just every once in awhile, it bothers me.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	This will be something you will have to deal with for a long time to come.  I had an unplanned C in 2004 and I still have itchy issues.  And every pregnancy I've had since it itches most of the time.  I've had to use astringent and other things to clean it in between showers to get the itching to stop.  Since then I've had all VBAC's and I wish I had've had a midwife or a better doctor for that birth so I never would've had to go through that.|`|AA11625299	well I just had a c on December 10th and I wear regular undies, thongs or boy shorts I havent had any problems|`|heDtLdz5aa	yes it is normal...my scar and the area around it were numb for a very long time...my son was born in oct of 2007 and i recently just noticed that i got most of the feeling back in that area...as long as there is no signs that there is an infection(which i am sure there is not it as been a while since your surgery)|`|E7LSetRHaa	Yes, it did for a while. It was real tender and itched sometimes. It took almost a year for that to go away. Now you cant even see my scar.|`|ntdGOZqGaa	More then likely its not the underwear it is the scar healing on the inside, mine would do that too. The scar would drive me nuts and itch all the time try some lotion on it. Hope this helps|`|Crdbwmo7aa	id say so... my scar still itches sometimes nd i had my section feb 15 2008
ojwRgCLqaa	Some people just can't stop. It's like a hobby. Or they really like kids I guess?  Why in the world someone would have 17 kids? I have no idea, that's insane.|`|RA8PuTd5aa	Think they always want to look after children... they'll probably feel lost and lonely when they're all grown up|`|ZJ03V8gBaa	Their children would have lots of uncles and aunts and cousins. It would probably be fun (but dramatic) to have such a large family! You'd never get bored.|`|nCFnFLCDaa	idk but they just had the 18th one|`|e6px2Ue2aa	They have seventeen kids and counting because they used to not want to have kids, but then one day i think the wife woke up and felt a message from god and it said that she should have kids and i guess she took that very literal!! hahah idk y would want seventeen kids though, kinda outrageous if you ask me!!! but i guess now they just slide out!|`|7HGeOJs0aa	I guess they like kids...|`|JnLoHaoAaa	They don't believe in birth control and let nature take it's course|`|AA11052660	i think its because they are addicted to that very special baby stage when the child is all helpless, cute and cuddly, full of wonderment and they want that stage to last forever.    But it doesn't, so they keep having kids in order to relive that experience again and again.    Just my theory|`|SKJb6eLKaa	I want 4-5 kids by the time im 35.    2 down, 2-3 more to go (but no more for 10-15 years!)    So its a preference.. But I'de NEVER raise my kids like they raise theirs! Their daughter is getting married and her fiance and her havn't even kissed yet ~ That's pretty cool but doesn't happen often!|`|lQIKWXDuaa	Because they have a big problem with having sex. What are they building an army? Is that the master plan to take over the world....  But honestly I wish I could have a large family but I do not wish to born them myself.

I don't really remember, but anyways, they took that as a sign that they shouldn't have been on birth control and they decided to let whatever happen, happen|`|3WWHWsHOaa	The Duggar family doesn't believe in birth control. Actually they have 18 at this time. Their newest addition was born this past december.|`|iSMWMhHraa	It used to be common to have large families. They believe that God is blessing them, they are not on welfare and are raising them to be responsible adults, which is more than most people can say about their one or two kids. If you knew anything about that family, you would know that they are not uneducated but actually good people. I wish more people were as good as they are.|`|u0mZAPuDaa	Oh dear... to love and hold!     That family is a family I wish me and my family could be like.    They have 18 children now and just married in their first in-law! They manage to have family dinners every single night! EVERY SINGLE NIGHT! How many families now a days are grabbing some burgers for dinner and hoping Dad gets off in time or their sons practice is over in time!    They have more values and morals then most families now. So, if I could have 18 children and love them like they do, I would do it!    I wish we could afford 18, I swear I would do it!    EDIT: Why do people say they have a 'weird' religion. They are just Christians! They just believe that god will only give them what they can handle and they let god determine how many children they will have. I am atheist, but I didn't think this was a 'weird' religion.    You know, before science created contraceptives that is the way everyone thought.|`|kWBXSjHXaa	Because they like to get FREAKY if you know what i mean without a CONDUM and get FREAKY over and over and over|`|547Ln6rNaa	I personally wouldn't want 17 or 18 or 18 and one on the way....I have one, I'd have liked to have two, but it wasn't to be for us.    If you want a social comment on the family, the Duggars seem to be happy, nice, well balanced people and all their kids seems to be happy, nice, well balanced people too....I like them.|`|U9pnPXnpaa	They love their children and look after them. They aren't on welfare and ask for money from no one.   They get money for their TV show but so do a lot of people - nothing wrong with that.     I'm a whole lot more concerned with a single woman having 8 kids after having 6 kids at home already when she's still living with mommy and daddy.    Now SHE freaks me out!|`|beLRXUN4aa	some people like kids?!|`|8H6HM7zHaa	lol your talking about the family with the octuplets and I think their crazy thinging they can raise 17 kids in a 3 bedroom house|`|1RJyplAfaa	The family doesn't believe in birth control.|`|zXOcVt5Aaa	Maybe some people just love kids and watching them grow up. it probs never gets old with them. Lol|`|mlwBLJHaaa	I would love to have that many children I love children so much. I am only 14 years old and I'd love to have octtuplets it just seems so great to have so many babies. I honestly would love to have 10 kids at once if that was ever possible I would want that to happen to me then. I want to have the most children ever had in man kind. I want to be in the book for having the most kids ever had in the whole wide world.|`|IpVuR4K2aa	they are Mormon and they don't believe in birth control. I personally would not have that many children, but what works for me might not work for them. by the way, their oldest son, Joshua, just got married.|`|AKKWDcqnaa	you'd think she'd have learnt her lesson after the first few!|`|nqOqaNIEaa	cuz they are stupid, uneducated southerners|`|8Qbx8PDnaa	LOL THE SHOW ON TV       HAVNT YOU SEEN THERE LIKE HILLBILLYS LOL|`|edGQba2Saa	i think if u can have and take care of that many kids its a beautiful thing
9pO3XVxMaa	Ellie,    Is there a chance you can home to where your family lives?  I think you are correct, he doesn't sound like he's being realistic.  He either needs to get a job and start planning for the birth your his child, or you need to make arrangements for you and the baby and do whatever it takes to ensure the baby is surrounded by people who can assist to support you until you can find a job and do it yourself.|`|R6du9nRIaa	First address the fact that your hubby is a man, being a man myself I find it particularly hard to admit failure when it comes to my family. Believe he is trying hard if he is still committedd to you and your future family. Second you are not married, and not working,(I assume because of your academic responsibilities). There are government assistance programs for woman in your situation. Get online and visit your states governmental website, there you will find assistance programs that you can apply for assistance. Being a single mother that is also a student you will have no problem finding support. And remember if you believe your situation is hard now, envision your future with no one there to lean on and offer support.|`|dc58vxOqaa	Are you asking a relationship question - whether or not you should break up with your boyfriend, or "should I trust this guy to support me and the baby financially" question?  They seem to be two separate things. As for financially the economy is a disaster right now and with him being in real estate it is highly unlikely his income will change in the next few months to a year, especially if he isn't selling anything presently. So, yes, I would say try to find other means of income whether it is you or him.      If you're wondering if you should be a single mom and break up with him because he is not bringing home the bacon, then I would say yes, break up with him. Not because he doesn't have any money, but because if you are considering leaving him for that reason alone - that he isn't making money, and otherwise seems to be a pretty good guy, then it doesn't sound like you are really in love with him. Don't stay with someone because you are hoping they will be able to support you. Those situations never work out and you are both really young. Find a way to take care of yourself and your baby regardless of if you are with this guy or not. Then you have both angles covered. But if you truly love each other, dumping him cause he hasn't been able to sell a house in the worst real estate market in years, isn't a good reason. People who are in love find ways to make things work, especially in the worst of times.|`|xBd96wvRaa	Time to buck up and plan on taking care of and providing for your baby by yourself.     Perhaps since he is not working he can watch the baby while you work. At least you will save money on day care.    Been there done that....|`|evFXsDvdaa	Shouldn't have gotten knocked up. Build a time machine. Fix the economy.|`|i8Cbh88jaa	Well, first of all i definitely wouldn't let him be your only support system. I would try to find a job, although i know that would be difficult being pregnant, but it doesn't hurt to try. Also, if he loved you and his future daughter, he would make an effort to get a job along side his realstate. i would try to tell him, listen if relestate is something you really want to do i support it, but think realistically, we have a daughter, and along that i would work but obviously im not in the condition right now. im going to need to you to at least get a job at a store or something. and hopefully he would understand. good luck hope i helped =]|`|Mq9GSSHhaa	Though it may be hard, you have the child's future to think about. You have to drop out of school and get a part time job, build up some money for when the child is born. And tell him to get a stable job ASAP or you're over.  Honestly, you need a stable income for the child. It is no longer about you, or him, it's about the child's future.|`|uuKTQ84Qaa	Yes the economy is really bad so i get you there and maybe you should see if anybody is  hiring you can always  lean towards  adoption ! Hope every thing goes well for you bye !! Hope i help !!!|`|OY8Z5vG9aa	im sorry to hear about your troubles dear.  the real estate market isn't that great right now.  my best advice for you, is that since he's not bringing and money in, and you said he's involved with things like gambling, then keep your finances separate from his.  see if a friend of yours can get you a part time job until the baby is born.  try to make some extra money on the side to buy some baby furniture and clothes.  talk to him and tell him to get his act together because he's not even supporting you let alone gonna be able to support a baby.  i also suggest, as hard as it is, don't move in with him until he gets his life together. also just remember, you have a million people on here you can talk to anytime you want. best of luck and congrats!|`|wfuy4Sxaaa	Well, you definitely need money and stuff.  A house would also be good  And if he isn't working out for you, try a close friend. you need the support.  Maybe some of your family can come help you out as well?
9kPPmazoaa	Your best bet is to purchase a ovulation predictor test... It will tell you when you are most fertile. Because we can only "guess". Good Luck!!! :)    *** Typically 10-14 days after the start of your period. But everyone is different.    You can also make a ovulation/fertile calendar, if that helps.   http://babymed.com/Tools/Fertility/Calen...|`|V8JoRHnnaa	14 days before ur next period is when u normally get ovulation so u can calculate.3 days before ovulation plus day of ovulation and a day after that is fertile window.

Su0O55W8aa	No, a child rapist should not be able to have a job where there are kids all around.  This is why they they have made sex offenders register their names, so people will know and be aware of what is around them.  He can legally have a job but it shouldn't be somewhere in "housing" where there are children period.  I think different states have different rules about it but I would check into it.  I would think it could be used as a basis to get out of a lease or for them to find another maintenance person.  The owner is the one who hired the person and should have known that he was a sex offender and if they are going to put families in danger because of that then they should pay the price by having their lease agreement broken by their tenants!  Until this is resolved I wouldn't leave my children alone there and make sure everyone knows about this!|`|6cN8aLnaaa	If he has been convicted then he has to register and if he is registered is probation officer or whatever he may have would not allow him to have a job in an environment where he might be "tempted". If it were my kids I wouldn't stand for it. I would contact your local authority on the subject to see what you can do about the situation. I am pretty sure that he legally is not allowed to work with in so many feet of a child's home.|`|e3AnmkfUaa	You should probably use your kids as bait and hook up a camera (set up a sting.) Your kids may be traumatized, but when they are older you can explain they did a good thing.|`|HtT9WCfGaa	No! I have no pitty for anyone who finds thrills in touching children.
Su0O55W8aa	I'm all about unique names but i'm just not sure about this one!  Theres something about it thats just not sounding like like a good baby name :-\ sorry!  Do you have any others you've considered?|`|mx3gFmIKaa	I really like it, at first glance though I thought it was Lakelyn so some people may mispronounce it.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	I think its unique and pretty. GO FOR IT! =)|`|G4XkXsbeaa	No. She'll probably be made fun of in school and before you posted the pronunciation of the name I was clueless as to how to pronounce it. Pick a more common name; not saying you have to pick a name like Emily or Jessica.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Not to me but the final choice is yours!|`|AKXJ0tEyaa	its really cute and unique   plz answer my  if you click on my avatar  it has an question what would  match to this   plz|`|cLWR6Uuaaa	I really like it.|`|L8XP51rdaa	Sounds like a pretty unique name, just like Elena.|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	Really unique and pretty i think that is a beautiful name because no one else really has it.|`|hBcMiZDBaa	you know, ive noticed people these days are trying to be like celebrities and name their children creative names.    dont do it. just go with something normal. most creative names just sound way stupid.    I cant imagine talking to a girl and call her "lakeyn". it sounds really awkward to me. like, might as well name her Pumpkin Face.    name her something normal. something that wouldnt make people be like "Whoa! Your name is Lakeyn? ....thats a weird name but whatever". cause, I HAVE seen that before.     Name her something normal. anything thats normal. thats my suggestion.|`|cee9f1031de69199cca4b81270c0bad6aa	Oh, yes. It sounds very beautiful, very romantic and musical.  i like it.
PFO1jxZGaa	well its part of his inheritage and how often will people call the kid by his full name? what i'm saying is does it really  matter? as long as you are both happy with the first name..If not then just tell him that you dont like the 'de' part. thats it, no running around it.   But sometimes you need to compromise a little. Like I'm white, my husbands puerto rican. In PR they give the kids moms last name and dads ( women dont take their husbands name at marriage) Although I took his last name, our kids were still given his last name and my maiden name.. Because he wanted so. Its confusing as hell sometimes ( at dr's, schools etc because we all have different last names, he has his dads and moms, I have only his first last name, my kids have his and my maiden name) but I did it because it was important to him.|`|dPULl5hjaa	Tell him the both of you must compromise on the name!  He probably doesn't full understand how the name might be misunderstood by people.by "de".  Remember, his Hispanic.    Say, I would feel more comfortable if you would see the situation my way.|`|cj7sSPZEaa	Just don't put the De part on the birth certificate!  Tell your SO that you want his name to be Gavin Xavier and that's it- it will still be carrying on the family name.|`|Ps5rsLyeaa	Gavin itself its not my favorite name... but the De Xavier part seems part of your husband's hispanic culture.. you should leave that part and change the first name... Its cute as a baby but not typically as an adult or maybe the baby can be named after your husband. Let him keep the De Xavier part and you pick a first name if you don't like this one.|`|S4pNsW3Taa	Gavin Xavier sounds cute see if he will do it wthout the de or you can just tell people his name is Gavin
9kPPmazoaa	Its to soon to be "showing"... so more than likely you are just bloated (sorry if thats not what you wanted to hear) But that doesn't necessarily mean your not pregnant. Many women in early pregnancy experience bloating. So its still "possible". You can take a test now, if it comes up negative... I would retest in a week. Good Luck... Hope you get that BFP :)    Period & Pregnancy symptoms are very similiar. So its hard to say. It sounds like you may have just had a "late" period... But then again anything is possible when you are having sex. Not to mention some women bleed in early pregnancy...    Take a test.  If your not pregnant, don't lose hope.  Good Luck, I wish you the best.|`|QY10Hmq7aa	Take a pregnancy test or go to the doctor. Good luck.|`|V8JoRHnnaa	3 days of heavy bleeding, i think there r very remote chances of u being prego. and also honey u dont have that big belly in just few weeks. at 8 weeks of gestation belly inceases very slightly. urs was too big. maybe its something else.|`|1MCGcjHJaa	go to the doctor because my last period was on may 12 2008 and for months i didn't get my period so i found out on dec.18,2008 that i have a baby in side of me i was 7months i didn't feel nothing moving inside of me but there was a baby there and the baby was healthy and i a having a girl
3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	Its possible your could be pregnant. Usually a period will start out somewhat dark, especially if there is old blood still left over.  That sounds like what you are shedding. So I would see your doctor and explain to him that you haven't really started and that you are only releasing old blood.  He should be able to give you a blood test and this will help ease your mind. I know what you mean about tests, they can be really frustrating.  When you had that faint positive it is possible that you had a chemical pregnancy.  But if you are getting a faint positive it does mean that your body is producing the pregnancy hormone. So go to your doctor and get that blood test done:).|`|2sHpQjPYaa	Hi,  I can definitely tell you that it is not the dye coming out.  The "dye" that is used for an HSG is actually clear in color, it is only called "dye" because it shows up white on an x-ray (due it's high atomic number).  Anyway, sometimes women can have bleeding or spotting for a little while after that procedure just from the instruments the doctor uses.  I would say maybe spring for a better brand test though.  I really hope you are pregnant, good luck!

Like for example, I like the B name Benjamin so I would use that (for my second son as I have my first sons name planned out already). If you like something like Benjamin then go with it or if you like another name go with that.|`|xpUyH0psaa	i think you should talk it out with her and decide on a name together. the baby is a creation by both of you, so you two should take equal joy in coming up to name such a wonderful miracle. don't say that you "gave her permission to name the baby". what happens when the baby learns about this in the future? what would he/ she think? so come up with a name together, and if you can't agree on a name, go for a compromise.|`|IuzaNq2Uaa	Well that was a very brave decision. Brody could be a lot worse.    My nephew is called Brody, and he has never had any problems with his name, except that it's very common so he usually has at least one other Brody in his classes. Sometimes the other Brody is a girl, but that doesn't bother him at all. It might when he hits high school though.|`|IySzQ8KNaa	it sounds ok to me if you think so? bick a b name that u really like.|`|pOekC2Sqaa	It's entirely up to you (and your wife) with whatever you name your child. In a way, I think that you should not have let her just have all the say - the choice in a name should come from both parents, not just one of them. How about compromise and let her make a list of names, and then you choose the ones that are your favourites from that list. That way your wife will get a say in the naming of your child, as will you - even though it wasn't you who came up them.    Edit: Personally I think Brody is a nice name, but not a name that you can grow with. It's a nice name for a kid, but for an adult not so much. However, if you're wife likes it - and if YOU like it - then go for it! Good luck!     G2B|`|apUkTo3maa	BYRAN   BRANDON   BRADEN|`|T6nmD3X9aa	Brody is a great name...cute little baby, hot guy..I like it    here are some more good B names I like:    Brett  Brendon  Brent  Bryant      God luck & congrats on the baby!|`|ae12c1d8c1c47a1b878b6100f2dccc4eaa	It's not about "you giving her permission", it's about both of you agreeing on 1 name and sticking with it.  Compromise! :)  If you don't like this idea of the B names running generation after generation in your family, then suggest a different name, or suggest his middle name begin with a B.      Christopher Brody  Alexander Brody  Alan Brody  Jackson Brody  Taylor Brody  ...   just try to be as creative as possible with it.  Pick a name that you both love!      When my boyfriend and I picked our son's name out I thought of Hayden, and he said "Ayden", plus my dad's name began with an A - and we went with Ayden.      Best luck|`|9AuiEEb8aa	I think it's cute that she's trying to keep a tradition going but i'm not big on the name Brody...|`|iIBTB5jSaa	yeah pick what you want i mean brody is that weird guy off of that mtv show called bromance though lol|`|3872e2bf03d56e8a75aa8f5b4bbb256daa	There are a lot of great boy's names starting with B.

Qe9rXFm0aa	I had mastitis TWICE..in 3 months...lol so what you decribed sounds exactly like the symptoms (especially since you had a clogged duct)    I am allergic to all pescription antiobiotics except one that I couldnt take while bfing, so I started taking 4-5 garlic cloves a day to clear up the infection (its a natural antibiotic)  http://www.kellymom.com/herbal/natural-t...    If you dont want to do that..you have to call your DR to get some pescribed antibiotics..but either way..if it is mastitis..you have to take care of the infection NOW..b/c it can turn much worse.    It could stil be the flu...but either way..I would get antibiotics|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	See your doc, what if its something else when your nursing you should see your doc|`|PAdif484aa	The only way to really get rid of mastitis is to let your girls nurse. The duct gets clogged and sometimes the milk will get curdle-like. It won't hurt the girls if they nurse and drink the clogged milk, so don't worry. Check out this website www.kellymom.com|`|e8FiZHkRaa	I tell you want, I'll pop over in about an hour. I'll give you the once over, have a drink of milk and let you know if they're all in working order. I'll bring you a portion of my freshly made tossed mucous plug and mediterranean salad. Scrumptious.  See you in a bit!|`|dLadxEJSaa	I had mastitis when Ben was a newborn. That sounds exactly like how I felt. I had a ridiculously high fever, breast pain, clogged duct, chills, and warm sensation on the side of my breast.     I took warm showers and massaged, pumped and fed as often as I could and took a little bit of tylenol to try and bring down my fever. I felt much better within a couple of days.     I hope you feel better!!!

Bw18seFqaa	Its NEVER ok to leave a young child alone in a car..  it only takes a matter of seconds for her to be kidnapped, or for the child to wake up, see she's alone, and get scared..  she could have gotton out of the car to go looking for you and gotton lost.      She may be peaceful fast asleep, but it would have been safer for you to wake her up, or do the back tracking to drop her off and then go back to the store.|`|6wsGQ1NCaa	Ever so lightly pick he/she up and carry them around :) You can never take a chance of loosing them..|`|HXfHkoSHaa	I don't think it was so bad, as long as you could see her the whole time, and the doors were locked.|`|fdnbXfvfaa	No, it really wasn't. Someone could have taken her from your car, or somthing could have happened to the car.  People have lost children from doing that, because the car went on fire. Your luck would have to be awful but it is not worth the risk|`|mowvERi1aa	you should have taken her in with you but it's over now just remember to take her in with you next time.    edit- okay lol i was just wondering don't take that as an offense..|`|hJWjSWYXaa	not unless you want her to get stolen!|`|AA10953999	Come on now people what are the chances the car is going to catch on fire or someone will take the car from the front of the store lol    On the flip side of your question... A friend of mine left her son in her car to run into a 7/11. It turns out the place was being robbed, she freaked out because she left her kid in the car and thought what if he wakes up and comes in or what if someone takes him out of the car.    I'd leave the kid in the car if the errand is going to take 5 minutes or less and its not a hot day. If it was too hot or I had other things to do then I would wake it up. Let your conscience be your guide.|`|Pk4CkcObaa	Regardless the area it doesn't matter, there are crazy people everywhere! Personally, if that were me, I would of disrupted your little sister's sleep because she could have an even better sleep at home, than risking someone breaking the car window or anything!  With it being 72 degrees, even with the window cracked, it can become very hot for a little child, and cause SIDS.  Thankfully she is okay and please don't ever do that again!|`|kO65JfS8aa	Question - would you have left your wallet on show or some cash or a laptop while you ran in? Or left your car unlocked with the keys in (when sister is not in it) A child is far more precious than any of that.    It is not O.K. It's done now so don't worry about it, just take it as a lesson not to do it again. What if another car pulled over and was too fast and hit yours? Or someone was watching you and decided to take a chance- even if you can see her you ,might not be able to run fast enough.|`|DXLfxoTNaa	You can answer this yourself. Think about the possible risks. Think about the gain. Did the risks outweigh the gain? If so learn from the mistake.|`|6d76adf164eef7a7f0b45aa1af0cc705aa	Never leave kids alone in a car!    Just over a week ago, here in Brisbane Australia, a mother left her baby asleep in her car while she ran in to a house to pay a bill.    The mother probably did not want to wake her daughter so she left her asleep with the aircon on and keys in the ignition (it was really hot here too.)  she was parked in a private driveway of a house in a 'nice' area.    A car thief stole the car with the baby still sleeping in the back!    Police later think the thief did not realise a baby was in the car at the time as the car was later found under a shady tree with windows down, and baby still strapped in the back seat. The thief even used the mother's phone that was left in the car to call her sister in law!     The actions of the mother caused a massive police hunt for the baby/car at the time. Luckily there was a happy ending as the mother might not have had a second chance.    After the story was on the news and talkback radio the mother was crucified by the public saying how stupid she was for leaving the baby in the car, some even calling the thief a hero for treating the baby better than the mother did.    I would never leave a child in a car unattended...ever.|`|AA11210211	NO it was not okay,even if it is for a minute or even if it's not to cold or to hot,You should never leave a child unattended in a vehicle until they are a teenager I think.Anything can happen why risk it.|`|2haW6GJbaa	I wouldn't take a chance just take ger in with you...you never know??|`|207dFmdHaa	I have six kids and I know what you mean, but, here is how my husband and I look at it, what if, just say what if, something happened to your sister, for the rest of your life you have to live with that, is it worth it? We always wake them up and take them with us, we never, ever leave them in the car|`|PFO1jxZGaa	I saw a thing on the news a while back about a woman who left her kids in the back seat and ran in the gas station for a minute. Now the idiot left the car running and doors open though so someone took the car and the kids in it. They found the kids couple of blocks from there...   I rarely leave mine but when I do I make sure the doors are locked, car is not running and I have the keys and also I only leave them in to go pay for the gas I'm about to pump and park right next to the building. If there is too many people I go to the next station... I would never run to the store with my kids in the car.  So I guess it was fine because nothing happened but I wouldnt do it again.. You never know...

Note: I personalyl wouldn't use any middle name that ends in the same "in" sound. Examples: Austin Sebastian, Austin Martin, Austin Landon, Austin Weston, Austin Aaron etc. It doesn't sound the best.    I also would avoid names that....    Start with the same letter Austin ends with. They tend to flow into each other, and I personally find it very unatractive in a name. Examples: Austin Nathaniel, Austin Noel, etc.      I actually quite like the sound of Austin Conley, but here are a few more suggestions for first names for Conley as the middle name.     Charles Conley  Aidan Conley  Bryan Conley   Roger Conley  Adam Conley  Robert Conley  James Conley  Brennan Conley  Edwin Conley  Tristan Conley (It sounds ok, but I like Tristan Rilet sooo much better. Tristan and Riley are just meant to be together!)  Steven Conley  Jason Conley  Bennett Conley  Benjamin Conley    I wouldn't use any first name that ends in the "E" sound that Conley does. It just doesn't sound right. Examples: Henry Conley, Brady Conley, Westley Conley, etc.    Good luck! =)|`|AA11347536	I like Austin Jayce.|`|6cu3RwBcaa	Better first name for Conley: Kyle Conley|`|k8pFvtMLaa	Austin Cole  Austin Brian  Austin Matthew  Austin Elijah  Austin Drew    I like Austin Cole a lot.

OLAtwLV6aa	that is every mother's own decision my opinion on it I don't like them I find it very disgusting to see a child over the age of 1 to be running around with a pacifier in their mouth and i've seen kids as old as 5 using them   my husband wanted to try one ( the lets try and shut her up method some parents use it for) she wanted NO part with it   so if the baby wants to suck on something a teething ring is best baby's will suck no matter what its how they work up their jaw and work out their tounges|`|KAwHCSW4aa	it is easier to use his thumb. and, you can never forget it somewhere! lol|`|UMRdHuuVaa	Okay - i am not trying to tell you what to do.  I was not going to use a dummy at all - but i gave my son one as it helped him sleep when he was about 2 weeks old, and he continued to use one for about 2 months after that.  He is now 7 months, he decided himself that he no longer wanted it - he just took it out one day and started chewing on it and threw it across the room and had no further use for it.  Now i had a dummy when i was a baby i had a dummy, as did my brother and lots of other people i know - we all have perfectly straight teeth with NO impediments at all.  My dentist has said to me he has never seen more straighter teeth and asked if i have ever had braces, i told him no and he was shocked they were naturally that straight.  If you are going to buy a dummy, buy the brand NUK they are designed by orthidontists and will not cause buck teeth in infants.  Dummies dont hurt them, because they will suck whatever they can get their hands on, so i think its better to give them soemthing designed specifically for that purpose.  Good luck  :)|`|AA12243380	It's your choice.    :-)    I don't have a problem with them.|`|NWxzhPMbaa	I also agonized about the decision and decided to use a pacifier because my baby was obsessed with sucking from the day he was born.  I don't regret it for a minute.  Studies have shown that pacifiers do not harm your teeth unless they are used through the toddler years (like until age 4 or 5).  They are recommended for use at night and for naps because they reduce the risk of SIDS.  Experts say you should wait until the baby is 1 month old if you are breastfeeding so that the baby doesn't have "nipple confusion."  Personally, I gave it to him the first week and never had a problem breastfeeding.|`|f634e4db5029a87b6d4fc2ef877c91e1aa	Sure buy a pacifier, but it's better to buy a teething ring, Don't worry it won't harm your baby's teeth at all, and it's a good start to start buying teething rings and pacifiers, you can find teething rings at your local dollar store, or in the "baby aisle" of a store.|`|PAdif484aa	I wish my baby would take a pacifier! They aren't bad. As for the thumb, it is really difficult with some kids to get them to stop sucking their thumb so don't start it. That is a bad idea. My friend's kids used pacifiers and their teeth are fine. I never used one and my parents spent a ton of money on my teeth! LOL.|`|dEd14ZaMaa	Okay I dont know what everyone's hang up is on pacifiers but the truth is they reduce the risk of sids for that reason alone I wanted to use one  However, of course as the mother it should be your choice  My son was always sucking on his thumb in my unltrasound pictures lol when I delivered him his lips were swollen from all the sucking (they went down eventually lol) He was always putting his hands in his mouth and starting to choke himself he would shove his fingers down his throat so far so when the nurse took him to the nursery to get his antibiotic he was on at first she rolled him back in and he had a pacifier in his mouth. I wasnt mad because I was planning on getting one as soon as I left the hospital. He's been hooked ever since. He's almost 8 weeks now and pretty much only uses it if he is going to sleep. I leave it hooked on his shirt and sometimes he'll hit it trying to put it in his mouth its the cutest thing! When it falls out if it lands on his arm he can already scoop in back in there  Oh and it doesnt harm theri teeth unless they are still using it when they are like 4 or 5 and thats a little to big to still have a binky but hey in Germany they send their kids to kindergarden with one
vnJG8UYJaa	Of course you cannot change the shape of your fact, but you can enhance certain features which will make you feel better.    You need to take a look at your hairstyle and make sure you are using one that will make your fact look a little less round.  You can enhance other features of your face using make up tricks.    You can make yourself look a little older by choosing a more mature look in your clothing.  I don't mean choose clothes that reveal cleavage or show a lot of skin.  I mean not choosing Hannah Montana t-shirts, but wearing a nice sweater instead.  Watch the style of jewelry you are wearing, too.    Personally, most people would love to have this problem.  I was a senior in HS and mistaken for a 7th grader by a substitute teacher because I was a gym aide.  I laughed it off.  Of course, you will want to be taken seriously when you get a little older and are looking for a job.  Practicing the above techniques will help you to gain that look you are wanting.  Good luck.|`|76ac485c49c2e00f916d7d67422bfe41aa	you'll appreciate this when your 30, and look 25  thats what everyone tells me, haha.|`|mowvERi1aa	wear a little makeup at least you wont look old when you grow up|`|S7tWzQH6aa	maybe your face hasn't taken full shape yet.it's alright..it'll come around one day..and just think  of it this way you get to look a couple a years younger !!!! :]|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You will be happy, when you do.

ACTa6N5Naa	Sounds like you need to sit down and speak to him because the problem could lie with him and not you.  I totally understand why you feel hurt its not exactly supporting you really.  The fact he has had kid in a previous relationship is really irrelevant! He should be focusing on your future together and if this means going to the ferlity clinc with you then he should go!  Hope it works out for you!|`|Xh5rWuGhaa	My fiance is kind of the same way. they don't understand how every lil thing can cause you not to get pregnant.

Just tell him it really means a lot to you and that your DR recommended it as part of procedure. Good luck hun!!|`|MAh2yKFnaa	sorry, no it is ok for you to feel how you feel. Just give it some time and do what you need to.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	Aw, honey. No it's not wrong of you...my husband was the same though, we were trying for two years and lost four babies in that time. When I booked us an appointment to et checked out he got really scared and said he didn't want to have his blood taken or anything. I can't figure out why he was like this...in the end they didn't need to check him out anyway...really I was just going because of the miscarriages, not for fertility reasons...<br>  <br>  Anyway they couldn't find anything wrong with me, we started trying AGAIN and now I'm 20 weeks pregnant (living on tenterhooks though! lol) <br>  <br>  Try talking to him when you're both in a good mood and try not to nag him...just gently explain how important it is that he gets checked out too if you want to have a baby. <br>  <br>  Hopefully you will just be like we were and it's just bad luck that you've not got a baby yet. Loads of "baby dust" and good luck hope it goes ok for you. xxx|`|Wd7ujHNhaa	He really needs to get checked out too!!!  I had my tubes tied and my husband and I really want another baby, so he agreed to get checked before I had my reversal to make sure that we weren't getting a reversal for nothing.  My obgyn sent the lab paperwork and a cup home with me, so that he could ejaculate into the cup in the privacy of our own home, then we took it to the lab within an hour, so he never even had to go in.  Maybe if you talk to your obgyn and your boyfriend, maybe this could happen for him and maybe he would be willing too then.  If they did find something wrong with you, then would you really want to go through all the hormonal changes from drugs if his sperm weren't up to par and you couldn't get pregnant with him?  Good Luck!!! and Lots of Baby Dust your way!!!|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Tell him point blank: do you want a baby or not? The only way it might happen is to be checked out and then they can help. He might think of it as a threat to his manhood if he has to 'produce' in order to be checked out for some problem, or is afraid that the problem might be his. There is nothing to be ashamed of, and it's the only way you're going to know.
ovi4hOpiaa	I know you said you have tried it but put her in bed at 8 or 9 and when she gets up at 3 am lay her back down as many times as it takes till she goes back to bed. If that does not work lay down with her till she falls asleep. I know it seems like she has too much energy during the day to take a nap but try to make her take one anyways at least for 1/2 an hour. She will get use to it eventually. i have the same problem with my daughter so through out the day i only give her water to cut down on her sugar intake. If i had only 1/2 the energy my kids have i would be happy. Good luck.|`|3Psi4kBxaa	Check with her doctor.

vxjLI5vbaa	First of all, if you're on vacation or away from the home some people (not just babies) tend to hold it in for a lot longer than usual... Just feed your child a lot of fiber (essentially works like a laxative but not as strong).

Had an enema all ready to go, but my boyfriend (of three years) made a tandoori curry one night - and forget to set aside some my neice before adding the really hot spices... and that got her going... (she enjoyed the curry though)|`|ozmRtpMyaa	about 2 days.  but he was fine|`|sqaey2Siaa	Since birth my son has had horrible issues with constipation. I'm not sure why, he eats plenty of fiber and fruit and drinks tons of juices.  When he was smaller I mixed one ounce prune juice in every bottle or juice. He has spells where he wont go for a few days, I would say 4 is the longest. I usually end up giving him laxatives or a suppository or stool softener. However I almost always end up having to help him go with a q tip or something. Constipation is pitiful in children!

Mind you many of these conversations were about kitties and yogurt, but they were conversations. She is 32 months now and can initiate and respond to all kinds of topics and is not thrown by them. But some kids don't do that until later. I think the standard is 50 words by 18 months.|`|Bu6kTnLfaa	my family are late talkers but i speeded up his develpement very fast with the online abc's  at starfall.com- its the bomb! he was talking within a month and now at 2 and a half can spell read and use the computer to drop and drag with the mouse- quick note- i used little candy treats like gummi bears everytime he got one right- positive reinforcement i think is crucial for developement in a child- more positive praises than negative down talk- i NEVER say nooo thats not it or noooo its this - just say the actual letter or let them figure it out or switch it if they keep getting it wrong|`|7rIAd6gGaa	My daughter  said 8-9 words by a year, 25 by 13 months, and over 200 by 15 months.

Things like animal names, car, Toyota (LOL that was his grandpas doing), shoe, coat, etc. Around 2 1/2 he started putting a few words together, like "have milk" and "baby Cadence" and "Grammy's house" and "have lunch" and "take bath" etc. Then shortly after that, he just exploded and started talking in full sentences and carrying on conversations, it seemed like overnight but it was probably over two or three months. After that it has just been more and more learning, repeating, practicing with changing letters (for instance, sometimes he calls me "Bobby" instead of "Mommy", the baby is "Babence" instead of Cadence", things like that.) Anyway, I hope that helps! :) Try not to worry too much about it. We were a little bit worried about Aaron, and he is just fine.|`|3F8f1SoQaa	My older son barely said a word until after 22 months, and caught up by about 26 months<br>  <br>  my daughter was saying 2-3 word phrases ( "more juice" etc) by about 18 months<br>  <br>  My youngest son said about 10 words up until 2 years old. At 2 years old I had him tested by early intervention ( and a speech therapist). It was determined that he has verbal apraxia and had a 12 month delay at that point. In the last 13 months of therapy he has totally made up his delay. He speaks in full sentences which started about 4-5 months after he started therapy. He does still have some issues with some sounds, so he is still in therapy.<br>  <br>  If you have any doubt if your child is behind at all, contact early intervention and they will do an evaluation and let you know if you need to worry.|`|NbJbZXtGaa	He began to talk at age one. Could carry on a simple conversation (answering questions mostly)  just after he turned 2 (like a sentence or two...two to four words per sentence) and was fully conversational by 2.5.<br>  <br>  Generally toddlers go through what is know as a "language explosion" sometime between 2 and 2.5 where they are adding several new words a day and you can barely keep up.

OqbwXWJEaa	Pumping will ensure that you are getting all of the milk out so that your body will make plenty of milk. Never, never, never throw away your valuable milk. You can always freeze it for several months and use it when you are away from your baby. If you do not plan to go back to work or school, you don't have to pump at all, but if you do, the sooner you start pumping, the more milk you will make. The more milk you make, the easier it will be to continue making plenty of milk when you need to leave your baby.    Debbie|`|Z7V7AbBQaa	You can freeze breast milk and then bottle feed it baby later.

Milk is good in the back of the refrigerator for up to 8 days.  It is also good in the freezer for 3-6 months  And in a deep freeze for 6-12 months  http://www.kellymom.com/bf/pumping/milks...    If you are pumping to increase your supply you can, pump an additional 5-15 minutes after each nursing session..or in between nursing (even if nothing is coming out)  If you aren't having supply problems, you dont need to pump.  http://www.kellymom.com/bf/supply/low-su...    O but if you are pumping to help with engorgment..only pump out about an ounce or so (just enough for your bay to latch on)...if you pump more you'll end up producing more than you need.|`|JU3TLLYjaa	you can freeze it, if you put it in back of freezer it's good for 3months|`|6cN8aLnaaa	The only reason I can think of that she might tell you to pump is if maybe they are engorged. My baby girl will be two months Monday and when I pump I put the milk in the freezer because I also feel like I'm wasting it. The only time I ever feed her from a bottle is if I have to go somewhere, which has only been twice, and sometimes in public. It kinda varies on how long you can store breast milk, in the things that I've read you can store it in a freezer with a separate door for about 3 months or so
35945512fbc551d838d93d04aad5f789aa	It's easier to change an infant's diaper because they don't move. And from what I've experienced, a toddler's diapers stinks worse because they eat food & not just milk.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Omg, yes! With an infant you don't have to worry about them excaping and with poop all over their butt cheeks to get on everything in your house. Toddlers are ALWAYS on the go, and poopy diaper changing isn't going to slow them down.    Oh, their poop is a million times stroger too. PPPPPUUUUUU|`|FHT6wsUpaa	My daughter is 11 months and diaper changes are a nightmare. Basically, she doesn't want to be bothered from whatever she's doing to get cleaned up. Sometimes a toy works to distract her, but if she decides she really doesn't want to be held down, she lets you know it. I've had bruises on my stomach and arms from her kicking me.    It's a big change...when she was about 3 months old she LOVED getting her diaper changed. She would just lie there and smile. The first picture I got of her smiling was on her changing table.    Good luck!|`|HXfHkoSHaa	Infant.  It's a lot runnier.  Toddler poop is like adult poop, and less messy.|`|KAwHCSW4aa	yes, because toddlers know how to move a lot easier, and they tend to wiggle and squirm because they want to play. infants don't know what "playing" is, so they just kind of lay there while you change them. also, the bigger the baby, the bigger the poop.
vUAjf0t1aa	Don't choose yet!!! Once you have the baby, my friend, you will KNOW his name!|`|uQ4J21BTaa	Carson Ryan sounds good.|`|kO65JfS8aa	Rider Ryan sounds a bit funny. Never heard of Carson but it's the nicest. Think about the meaning of the names if you can't decide, and go for the nicest meaning.|`|72SrLDQ3aa	I like Jackson Ryan the best .|`|gRnARw6Oaa	Carson Ryan|`|X2G8EHBlaa	Rider Ryan its different!|`|bzkSIJYnaa	I like Jackson Ryan! Jack is such a cute nickname. I'm not a fan of Carson. It reminds me of  a car. :) Also, Rider sounds kind of like "ride her", which is a little bit dirty :)  But Jackson is my favorite, i love it!|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Jackson Ryan is best.    Ryder is a better spelling too but Ryder Ryan is a bit, I don't know the two R's don;t go very well|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I love every single one of your names, but none of them paired with Ryan. Carson and Jackson end in N, so does Ryan, which I don't like the sound of. And Ryder Ryan is double R's, major no-no.  If you don't mind, can I suggest these to you?  Jackson Ryder is great, and one of my favorite names  Carson Ryder  Jack Ryan / Ryan Jack  Ryan Henry    good luck! :)|`|gwI5SQ6Iaa	i love the name jackson. jackson ryan is a great name.    good luck;] congrats|`|Og4Ab2dSaa	Carson Ryan|`|8OoqHpbIaa	Ryan Carson|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I like Jackson Ryan the best!

Rider Ryan is too much of a tongue twister.  Best of luck!|`|EcTRTOahaa	I like Carson best.   Keep in mind, it's difficult for us to pick a name without knowing the child's last name.|`|lnZjIhDCaa	Carson Ryan is my favorite. Good Luck!|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I think Carson Ryan is the best!    I like the name Rider spelt Ryder, but Rider Ryan sounds a bit funny.  Jackson is too common and I'm just not a fan of it!      Good luck!   :)|`|0wrP5tQeaa	Carson Ryan is adorable.   Carson is one of those names that could fit with any age. Unlike those names like 'Bobby', those names could only work if your like a worker that is in an office or something. It doesn't work good if your just a little kid, like 4 years old.|`|fZXYWPIyaa	Rider is a really cute name. i dont know what you think but i think its the one to choose|`|tOi44Z0paa	Jackson Ryan sounds the best.|`|hypmxRlJaa	Jackson Ryan is adorable! I like Rider, but it doesn't flow well with Ryan. What about Rider Bryan?|`|qXq0nmBzaa	Too bad you weren't having this baby in the 50s or early 60s when TV Westerns were at their peak.    All your names sound like something out of "Wagon Train" or "Bonanza"    The first & third are too rhymy while the second one is very difficult to say since both names start with "R".|`|0aGTgxONaa	Jackson|`|R1cey1Evaa	Rider Ryan sounds a little cheezy. Carson Ryan is absoutley gorgeous! I am not a fan of Jackson, I know 2 dogs with that name.
k8pFvtMLaa	I don't like naming kids with all the same letter. It limits the choices for names. I think giving them names that start with a different letter is better, it makes them more individual instead of being part of a set.|`|ej51eWO7aa	i dont like your boys names srry but your girls names r awesum|`|gwI5SQ6Iaa	i think it would be okay if they were quintuplets. i wouldn't do that, but they're your kids you can name them whatever you want. lol|`|KAwHCSW4aa	i am not too fond of marty.     heres some    Myalyn  Macey (or macee, macie, macy)    or for boys  mitchell|`|NqEw4skBaa	well when they want to write initials on thier own stuff...they wouldn't   be able to tell the difference...  but I like all the names besides Marty --maybe just stick to Martin|`|apUkTo3maa	I LOVE MAKAYLA AND MACKENZIE|`|OI29tkSoaa	Sure why not.|`|UX3xjsFlaa	I like Madison and Mackenzie but they are both too popular. I went with Ella Grace for my little girl- thinking it was unique and it turns out everywhere I look there is another Ella! Not always Ella Grace but still..  These are the names I like right now:  Boys- Riley (my son's name), Talon, Owen, Weston, Oliver, Zeke  Girls- Audrey, Chloe, Tatiana  **M Names- Madeline for a girl or Marc for a boy**|`|R1cey1Evaa	I don't like it very much when people name their kids all one letter, it's kinda cheezy or weird.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I'm not a big fan of it, but it's up to you! Imagine having 18 children like the Duggars beginning with the same letter. It would be hard finding names you really, really love!    I like the names you have, Mackenzie is my favourite for a boy or a girl.    I also like:  Macey (F)  Maya (Maia) (F)  Mason (M or F)      :)|`|qXq0nmBzaa	Some people think it's charming to use the same letter for all children.  Personally, I think it shows laziness.   Instead of finding names that work on an individual level, it's easier to slide by and just pick names to match the letter.  Usually, the last kid gets the dumbest name because the family had to stretch to find that last matching name.    You do have ONE nice name in the group: Matthew.    Makayla (how horribly spelled!!), Madison, and Mackenzie are all names where you can follow the leader. Due to the immense numbers of children with these names, your children will spend their lives using the initial of their last name to differentiate them from the rest of the pack.    Marty is a nickname. Will this be a boy (Martin) or a girl (Marta/Martha)? Please don't condemn a child to this gender-bender hell with a nn. Please use the full/traditional name with Marty as a nn.    Well, as you can tell, I really feel you should rethink the concept.|`|fKCWfCviaa	i like the all M names idea.. but i am not the biggest fan of the ones you picked.    i like Mackenzie and Matthew. and i kinda like Madison.    there is alot more M names to choose from.  Mallory  Molly  Miller  Mitchell  Macy  Mason  Millie

UA8zGGTsaa	Why the HELL would anyone even CONSIDER having fertility treatments when they live at home with their parents and six kids, have filed for bankruptcy, and with the father leaving to his native country (Iraq) to scrounge some money for their family?    The link you gave us says that EACH infant has 2 nurses devoted to it and only it. Thats SIXTEEN nurses! How do they suppose she is gonna pay for that? Regular births are expensive enough! Then you have to think about diapers, bottles, clothes, schooling, food, etc, multiplied by eight.     She isn't gonna pay for all that. WE are, and it IS our business, since OUR tax dollars are gonna pay for all fourteen of those kids.|`|WJjfrf0Caa	According to the header above the article in the link, these are the story highlights:    Story Highlights    Grandmother of the eight babies: 'They are so tiny and so beautiful'    The father, a contract worker, is due to return to Iraq, mother-in-law says    Mother of babies appeals for privacy while she recovers from giving birth    Large medical team monitoring babies; each infant has two devoted nurses.      Many have stated that she is not married, but the second highlight clearly states that the FATHER is due to return to Iraq. Now in the article itself, it states, "Suleman said she was concerned about her daughter's homecoming because her husband, a contract worker, is due to return to Iraq."    This sentence is a little ambiguous because it's unclear who's husband it is. I think that the story highlights makes the connection that the person going to Iraq is the husband of the lady that gave birth.    At this point it appears that she is married since the evidence points that way, but this could all be a grammar mix up and the lady could be a complete psycho with too many babies. In that case there is a huge problem. So I suppose we'll just have to wait and see until we can pass judgment.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Well she already have 6 kids & why she made the decision to use fertility drugs only her alone knows but now here's the end result of which she has to contend with. If she doesn't have the help of her parents/family then I don't know how she's going to make it with all those kids|`|yV373JUiaa	what most people are upset about is the fact that she had all 6 other babies from in Vitro and the doctors still allowed her to implant and continue with 8 viable eggs. It was un ethical for the doctor to give her that many eggs at once knowing that she had overwhelming success with the first 6 pregnancies.     Others are angry because she is not married and is caring for 14 children (by choice) alone and will most likely rely in goverment programs to help bail her out. Its not that people are complaining about helping children, its that she chose to have more when she already had a full house, and then she continued on knowing she would end up having 13 (the 14th baby was a shock to everyone).    I really dont give a crap either way. It's her problem and blessing.    Edit- to the girl above me: she used fetility treatment becuase both of her tubes were blocked. Her father is being helpful, but the grandmother come forward saying that she was ashamed of her daughter and would not be helping when she got the 8 babies home.    EDIT- her name has been released. she is not married according to the Grandmother and she has been obsessed with having kids since she was a teenager.|`|alJA3jyCaa	I hope the state of California CPS is going to look into this...does she have the means to support all the children? is she sane?|`|8zOdKD7Qaa	So long as she takes care of them and they don't become the state's promblem|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	As far as im concerned its nobodies business, as long as she can take care of them who cares, I think shes a little crazy personally|`|dn2UCOkqaa	YAY for her!!!! And I would rather not discuss it anymore. This lady is old enough to make her own decisions I think people should worry about teenage pregnancy. Its more of an issue.|`|2MKvrydWaa	i really don't have a problem with it after all what did she do 2 me?i say good for her not many people can handle that and not many women go through that experience.|`|2OFixxqgaa	i think she is one hell of a woman|`|jYPeis3Saa	i think its insane. and i would really like to know what doctor in their right mind would agree to implant that many embryo's in someone who already has that many children. it also seems like the mother of this "woman" is not happy at all about what her daughter did (from an article i read this morning) and the mother sytated that the daughter has been obsessed about wanting children since she was a teenager. this speaks volumes. sounds to me like she needs a mental evaluation. and the fact that she lives with her mother says that she cant take care of herself. i feel sorry for the moth of this "woman"   and of course people that have litters of babies get free handouts right and left. makes me sick.|`|FA710vETaa	i think everyone needs to mind their own freakin business|`|wi6mkT30aa	This is such a good question, because I just think it is so ridiculous that a none married woman, living at home with her parents, with 6 babies all under the age of SEVEN should NOT even be allowed to try to get pregnant again by a Dr. who implants the embryos. IT should be illegal!    I personally felt happy when I heard about the Octuplets I thought wow what a miracle! Now, I just think it's sad that these children are coming in to the world with a woman that is not prepared.     (This has nothing to do with single mothers, my mom was a single mom as well and she did her best. We didn't have much but she was smart enough to just have one child and take care of her responsibilities!)      This woman is now getting a "Free Ride" in the system for having Octuplets, and it's just crazy! She's going to get so many things for free and YES at first I thought this was great but until I found out she is just have babies after babies after babies on no good Solid ground, I'm just taken back and disappointed!    In this case i think the Dr needs to pay, why should we? She MADE this choice to have children who she clearly can't take care of.     I was wondering WHY she was so private about this! Now we all know, she's a careless person that is just having children for the wrong reasons. She needs to watched. Seriously how can a YOUNG woman take care of 14 children ON HER OWN without a husband and a home of her own. She doesn't deserve to even have these poor kids, but I'm sure the system or goverment or SOMEBODY out there will baby her and buy her a new home, clothing, dipars, toys...the things are listless!      This really makes me sick!    They said that she has  6 children ages 7,6,5,4 and 2 year old twins. They told her after she got pregnant with Octuplets to abort most of them but a few, I think that is just sad on the doctors! They should have talked about that BEFORE this even ahppened and didn't even allow her to do such a thing! Just sad!    Good question by the way, I needed to get that off my chest! lol|`|e2b21fd20c367dca35eaf27554ccf1efaa	Yes it's true that we will always pay taxes. That doesn't trouble me nearly as much as does the fact that this woman made the CONSCIOUS decision to bring eight children into this world, but she denied them the chance of having a FATHER. Don't daddies count for anything these days? Why are people missing this point? The woman already had six children and she's not even married now. You have to wonder how little her father meant to her that she would inflict fatherlessness on her own children. It's not her parents' responsibility to raise those babies for her. Those folks already look like they've been through the wringer (and I think the man we see on the news is her step-father, not her biological father...God bless him!). We, as a society SHOULD speak out against these irresponsible acts of procreation and discourage them. I am pro-life and pro-family. I wish this woman well and I hope she finds the help she will need to raise all of these kids but I truly believe she acted in a selfish and thoughtless way and NOT in the best interests of her six older children and the eight babies born via in-vitro fertilization. People shouldn't confuse this sensational story with a woman's right to choose what to do with her body. That's absurd and it makes women sound like irresponsible retards.|`|ScRUJ9twaa	there is nothing wrong with having children, while i probably will never have that many in the future it is her choice, now she has a bigger family. it is her business. if she is happy, then thats what really matters.
DXLfxoTNaa	With the preschoolers I babysit, I put shaving cream on the table and write letters in it.  They love smearing it around and really encourages writing. If you don't mind the clean-up it is a lot of fun.      You can cut out letters from paper and hide them around the house. She will have fun with you trying to find all the "A"s and she will be more likely to recognize the letter.  Each day use different letters.     Playdough letters are fun too.|`|IxD8aNHTaa	make up a song. like in stead of the abc song everyone in the english speaking world knows, make up a brand new for her.|`|INmPiwnMaa	My son loves starfall.com|`|krI2fziJaa	Get some DVD's like Leap Frog Letter Factory and maybe Blue's Clue's alphabet.

Also, buy the letter magnets for the fridge and maybe a puzzle or two.|`|IqOaDmBbaa	Id go with the classic. "ABCDEFG,HIJKLMNOP,QRSTUV,W,X,Y, & Z.

Its worked for everyone for so long... and its cheap.|`|Ki5xSgmGaa	What really helped my twin girls was an alphabet floor puzzle, the foam kind, that I purchased at Walgreens for $10.  They love puzzles and we would make it a game, calling out the letter and seeing who could find where it goes.  We did it everyday for about a week and I was amazed at how quickly they learned.  Super Why on PBS is a great kids' show, it's all about letters and words.  Also, stick with capital letters only at first.|`|tM1Osw60aa	Here's a cool one for kids who like to color:    Take three sheets of construction paper.  One one of them, draw a block-letter, on another, a picture of something that begins with that letter.  The third, leave blank.    Let your daughter color the page with the letter.  When she's done, give her the one with the picture.  Meanwhile, cut out the letter.  When she's done coloring the picture, let her glue the letter to the blank sheet of paper, while you cut out the picture.  Then she can glue the picture to the paper with the letter on it.  So you end up with something like a big, block A and an acorn on a piece of paper.    Then, if she's all about gluing or coloring or glitter, let her add a finishing touch.  The whole time, you can talk about the letter, the sound of the letter, the words that begin with that letter, etc.    B is my favorite one to do because you can make a butterfly out of two Bs :)    There are some great ideas on preschoolstation.com too.    Have fun!|`|Nn9t3DyYaa	try making up a new version tell her it's for girls only let her help u make it up then work in the flash cards as u go i helped my daughter when she was 2 1/2 with puzzle pieces for room decor with alphabet on them we made a carpet out of them on here bedroom floor we hopped around and sang until she got it and it didnt take long at all just be patient she'll learn think of her favorite book or cartoon characters make up a really nice game song story where you could teach her and you can have fun together

There was something wrong in these babies that caused them to die.  Its not your fault.  As far as what your husband thinks...talk to him yourself!  There is no way for anyone in cyberspace has any idea about what he thinks.  No one but you knows your personal life.  God doesn't punish people like that sweetie.  This may seem insensitive, but God DID give you a child.  Unlike alot of women and other couples in this world who cannot even have ONE child.  God Bless you and stay strong.|`|RvddYKqjaa	You are so depressed now, and I don't even know how you can write. There is not a thing wrong with you God didn't do this. Sinners don't just have God take away their babies. We are all sinners. None of us would have children. I can't answer if you will carry another baby full term. I thank God for your precious 9-year old. I hope your husband has made you very aware that he thinks nothing of the kind and is not disappointed. He has to be more mature than that. You may be feeling low and worthless, but you have a husband who needs you and a 9-year old daughter who is most likely mourning too. Make sure your daughter knows you are OK. Make sure she knows she is the joy of your life. When you say you want to go, if you mean die, then get over it. You have to love your daughter more than that.|`|oX4mg0ghaa	No you are not worthless!!! Everything happens for a reason!

Stay strong and keep trying. If you get pregnant again, don't worry about having a stillborn. Just tell yourself "third times a charm" and be confidant that you will see your beautiful baby being born healthy and perfect.  Be positive.  Also you might want to talk to your doctor, and possibly a spiritual person that you look up to. I'm sure your not being punished for anything.|`|oCfOuIr8aa	Its clearly biological.

None of this is your fault.  You're not worthless  And this don't mean you're a bad mother/wife/woman.

God bless you|`|2OFixxqgaa	i am so sorry  you should see a shrink it could really help and no i am not being  mean god bless you|`|ZAOzJAwwaa	omg dont worry its really sad thing to experience i hope that doesnt happen to me wen i am older but its not ur fault  it was just a tragic accident ur husband will never think ur an utter disgrace ur fine u are just going through a period now don't worry he is probably feeling sorry for u thats really sad to hear i am sure if you try again then it will be a healthy baby! its not ur fault at all! i am thirteen right and when my mum was pregnant the doctor said to abort me coz i would be mentally disrdered and would not live past the age of 5....well mum didn't listen and i am fine i get good grades and stuff so don't worry for all we know the doctors gave up on ur daughter like they did me most probably is she would have fought through if the docs tried harder but everything happens for a reason...ur fine have another go and throughout ur pregnancy keep it slow as possible never give up hope..... :)
WXExyAlWaa	A woman wants an abortion like a fox in a trap wants to chew its leg off.    It is a terrible and difficult decision to make. If she does not want to keep the baby she could either have the abortion or put it up for adoption - though the pregnancy itself will be hard on her body, and the foster care and adoption system are very flawed and very often not good environments at all for children to be in. I suppose she will have to weigh up the emotional costs of an abortion with the physical and emotional (and financial!) costs of a pregnancy, plus the longterm consequences such as whether the child will want to seek her out later.|`|zdqn5R6oaa	adoption. i know this must be sooo hard for her, but she must take responsibility for her actions without hurting the innocent baby. if she decides on adoption, she might also be helping another couple out there that's unhappy because they aren't able to have a baby.   i wish her luck! hope this helps! : )|`|5akokd0Faa	go to church and seek God|`|H5i8BMh2aa	If she doesn't want another kid, but doesn't want to abort, then there is always adoption, which is a great alternative to abortion.  Otherwise, she should keep the kid!  She can get child support if she needs too.|`|AA11828121	She shouldn't have been having unprotected sex with a guy that she's so on and off with, she knew the chances.    She will probably get more excited as time goes by.|`|Jn1ZfBxlaa	Adoption, plan and simple. There are thousands of couples who would love to raise her child as their own. Tell her to get in touch with local adoption agencies. They'll be able to educate her on how the process works and get her in touch with potential adoptive parents. She can make her decision from there.|`|Daoa7x9Laa	i think it will be hard having an abortion but it'll be twice as hard having a child in an unstable enviornment, why bring a child up that way, its not fair on them, to be honest she will have to make a very important decision, after all its not just her to think about

Actually our Parents Association is more worried about who isn't at the meeting than raising money for the Children.<br>  <br>  I am new to the PA at my Sons school, but I am finding them a little unbearable.<br>  <br>  Thing is Jili, you only need one or two to listen to your ideas, and the others are like cloned sheep. They follow.<br>  I went to a meeting, and said right we will be doing this, this and this, raising money for a new playground. And I had 2 people listen, we've organised a bake sale and a Farmers show day (where the kids show their animals) and hopefully we will get the money.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about them all, it just stresses you. Just pick out the weakling, and get them to help you. The rest will follow when they see what a great idea it is.<br>  <br>  ETA<br>  Be rude to them Jil. Seriously, it works. I've implied people are lazy, and they hate it.|`|iHJuXKBiaa	I unfortunately am the sheep, baa baa......Sounds like Charli has it dead on. It was the same way when it came time to set up the culmination ceremony for my son's class. Nobody wanted to help decorate or bring food......they just offered money. Fortunately my job let's me get away with anything involving my children, so i got to do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe they need an incentive, cause God only knows education and knowledge are too highly overrated......(sarcasm)|`|0hxK0khKaa	Tie them to a chair, and say you will hold their babbys hostage until they surrender.|`|oENe16luaa	Send in the Y!

We do volunteer work and fundraisers.  I took over the position in hopes of turning things around and motivating the younger people (I figured those who had been w/ the company for 20+ years were pretty much set in their ways anyhow).  I tried and tried and tried- no luck.  Within 3 years our local club folded and joined another.  1 year later, they folded.  It's really sad and I have a hard time trying to understand why others don't wish to help a good cause.  It's very frustrating; I'm starring this in case my contacts can help.  Good luck.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	Lots of PTOs go through the same thing.  <br>  <br>  We've got the same problem in our PTO and, from what we've heard at district-wide PTO council meetings, our school actually has one of the more involved & active PTOs in the district!  <br>  <br>  It's not an easy problem to solve.  There could be so many reasons why parents choose not to be involved.  <br>  <br>  Some are intimidated by the perceived 'clique-ishness', but don't realize that it only seems that way because that same group of people who do everything get to know each other well, because they are always in there doing everything together...  <br>  <br>  Some are frightened by the perceived time commitment.  Again, this is a problem that occurs because they *see* the same parents doing everything so think that they could not, possibly, commit as much time to helping as the ones who are there helping all of the time (because nobody else is in there doing it!)<br>  <br>  Some just don't see the value in getting involved. <br>  <br>  Some don't know how to get involved.<br>  <br>  Some lack the self-confidence to get involved.  <br>  <br>  And, many, many more reasons...  <br>  <br>  It's probably something that your parent group will *always* be working on resolving, in one way or another.  <br>  <br>  Our group has just recently decided that we are each going to try to bring one new person into the planning part of each committee that we head.  So, when my next event comes up, I will choose one person on my volunteer list (and we do get 2-10 parents who sign up to volunteer for each event, anyway) and ask them to actually help me in the planning & chairing of the event.  Sure, it will take longer to get things done that way, but we think it may pay off in the long run to have more confident, experienced volunteers who see how things work from the planning perspective. <br>  <br>  Have you joined at <a href="http://www.ptotoday.com/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.ptotoday.com/index.php</a> , yet?  There are often discussions & articles regarding volunteer recruitment & retainment on there.|`|lkhCeAdJaa	For the second part of your question;<br>  It's the same everywhere.  Those who enjoy the fundraiser business do it and those who hate it don't.  Sometimes you can talk the ones who don't feel strongly either way into helping out, but even those parents will come out of the experience with a stronger opinion.  <br>  For the first part of your question:<br>  Motivation, unfortunately has to come from within. To be honest, I am a fund raiser hater and NOTHING  (within reason) could motivate me to participate....nothing.<br>  I am one of those parents who would rather pay money out of my pocket than do a fundraiser....I hate them that much<br>  ;-)<br>  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br>  Rosie...<br>  Thanks for adding the bit about being busy!  I was beginning to wonder if I really AM lazy.  I mean I only have five children and run a home daycare. You had me worried there for a few minutes!|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	With the economy the way it is, no one wants to donate money.<br>  <br>  And people are too lazy to do anything, so they'd rather just give money, but since no one has any, they don't do anything.<br>  <br>  Besides being lazy, people are just too busy nowadays.  A lot of times both parents work, so any free time has to be spent cleaning and tending to other needs.<br>  <br>  I guess just hope for the best.  Good luck!|`|AA10285288	No, its like that here, too. There are parents here that some of us are always having to pick up the slack from.

prqrQcd1aa	I would be upset that she didn't feel she could talk to me about it, but i'd be very glad that she was at least thinking about preventing pregnancy. Things are set up the way they are because some parents simply will not put their children on the pill even if they know they are having sex. They think it would further encourage it.. some of them do atleast. Then there are the kids that just don't feel right talking to their parents about it no matter what..even if they are open about sex, then there are the parents that don't even like to talk to their children about sex at all... they leave it to the school system to do it.     I have 3 little girls and i don't like to think about these things right now, but i know in time that i will have to. I will be talking to my children about sex as soon as they hit puberty, and hopefully they will remain open as they are with me right now when they get older so they don't have to feel they need to go behind my back to do it!|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	Honestly, if she went and did that then you could pat yourself on the back.. you raised her to be a responsible person.     I would be hurt that she didnt come to me, but happy that she is taking the right actions.|`|bc50adcd7a4cda84a5f4451579fa7554aa	i would be more upset that she didn't feel that she could come to me about it but am glad that she is taking precautions against pregnancy. i am willing to take my children in to the proper doctor for all that when it comes down to it, i just hope they know they can come to me and ask.|`|zc7xneuOaa	I did this behind my mothers back.  She was distraught that i didn't go to her and that i had gone behind my back.  The only advice i could give to parents is to be more open about sex regardless of how embarrassing the topic is because i'd have much rather been with my mother when i went for the pills than on my own.|`|e0eknuJ0aa	You can get them from your local health department. I did it when i was under age ..maybe 7 years ago. No my parents were not happy when they found out but i think you need  to be happy at least for the fact that if your daughter is having sex OR at least thinking about it then she is prepared!!!! She is thinking ahead of time which is great. Alot of girls her age get on them "just in case". And alot use condoms in addition to being on the pill. BUT i would talk to her about it. Your her parent and if she is grown up enough to get on the pill then she should be grown enough to talk to her mother about it. IF your worried about STD's explain that to her... It may seen like she doesn't care and doesn't want to hear but she is listening!!    Hoped this helped!!|`|9F6EKGLsaa	This is a very melancholy moment, in that you should applaud the young lady for taking the time to think about birth control and obviously the young lady has listened a few lessons in school :-)    However it does take two to tango :) and as such we can't over look the importance of teaching our young that, both partners must use contraception to lower the risk of pregnancy/STI to the lowest possible level.|`|2OFixxqgaa	at least she is being safe|`|AA11210211	okay so because your daughter doesn't want to come and talk to YOU about it you would rather her get pregnant then find protection herself??There are so many things wrong with this sorry I don't mean to sound rude but it's how I feel.I would be VERY proud of my daughter for getting protection  for herself if in fact she doesn't want to talk to me about it.I see nothing wrong with getting BC without the parents consent there are SO many teenagers  now days who are scared to talk to their parents about it and end up getting pregnant,it is sad really.|`|LNnRSLdtaa	its not wrong for teens to be able to get the pill without parents concent  what if the teen was too afraid to tell there parents which resulted in them geting pregnant?    id be glad my daughter was being safe  as i know teens are going to have sex and theres nothing you can do about it|`|4el3goYMaa	Personally, relieved that she is taking the inicitive to get birth control. I was a teen mother and I would not want that hardship for my daughter.|`|0aVHTRAEaa	I think you should applaud your daughter for taking the initiative to prevent pregnancy.  Would you rather her come one and say "Mom, Im pregnant?"  Do you have an open relationship with your daughter I wonder why she didnt feel like she could come to you.  My Mom was always open with me about birth control.  When I was 17 I went to her and told her that I was serious about a guy and that while it hadnt happned yet, it probably would and I wanted to get on the pill.  She had me in the doctor's office the next day.  My daughter is young, I plan on being as open with her as my Mom was with me.    I'd be hurt if she didnt come to me, but if she doesnt come to her Dad or me I'd be happy that she is taking the necessary precautions.

9Y6Nebffaa	im 32 weeks and saw my doc about this last week as it was keeping me awake at night and I coudlnt  get comfy in day. He said it was severe heartburn and indigestion as at this point in pregnancy your stomach is squashed right up under your ribs by baby. I used gaviscon regularly and fpr a few days just ate little plain meals like toast and yoghurt to give my stomach a rest and it did subside. One thing that did make it a lot worse for me was fresh orange juice so I have been avoiding that to. Hope that helps! x|`|qERAKF13aa	i had the same thing and called my doc, they told me i had gastric reflux, its like heartburn but times 20! its painful, if you have the pain right in the middle where your ribs are and it feels like you swallowed a huge pill and its stuck in there then thats what you have. my doc told me to drink something for heartburn, not eat 2 hours before bed and eat little portions more often, hope this helps!

My daughter has started having a BM during the night since we started solids so I just swaddle her arms and she doesn't seem to wake all the way.|`|dXVA1wHDaa	The only thing I can suggest is to keep the room as dark as possible, try not to even make eye contact with him (it sounds cruel, but I think it stops them thinking it's playtime!) and just try and get it done asap.|`|1NDHSSqwaa	I would suggest you keep the room as dark as possible (put on a small table lamp or the hallway light so you can see what you are doing) and not talk to your son whilst changing his nappy. Also try popping a packet of wipes on the radiator so that he does not get the shock of freezing cold wipes on his bum in the middle of the night.|`|OuuYoSBeaa	keep the room as dark as possible when going in and try not to talk with him. After you are done, just give him his soother or blanky or whatever, and leave the room. the longer you hang out, the more he will wake and want to play.|`|JXFYdTqmaa	with,y little girl for night feeds and changes, i put on  the night light, and just whispered to her, so she knew it was bed time. seemed to work for me.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Oh do I feel your pain! There for about a week or two it never failed that as soon as I would get my son to sleep I would lay him down in bed and check him, and he was always pooped. When my son has diarhhea it doesn't smell (weird I know) so I always have to check him, and I got so frustrated because he always managed to do it at night. and there is really nothing you can do, I mean we can't leave them like that so we have no other option but to change them. I did manage to do it once without waking my son up, but I did it very gently, and when he started to stir I would stop and let him get back to sleep and then finish up... Try to put some Pj's on him that are a little easier to take off, or maybe just a big t-shirt, so you dont have to unzip, un button, or take his pants off. I got so Frustrated I just let my son sleep in a t-shirt, and thats when I managed to not wake him up. Just hang in there, it will stop here before too long!|`|a54770af827395ce98439812fd4cc3e3aa	The ashton and parsons will help, just keep giving it, even when it seems he is over the worst of it.<br>  There is no magic formula for getting them back to sleep, but I try to do it as quietly as possible. I don't switch on the light, I use a very low light that barely lights up anything, but it stops my baby getting over excited. I also whisper and sing quietly to her and then rock her in my arms afterwards. Failing everything else, its a bottle of warm milk.. that usually does the trick!|`|yBYQCYGuaa	My only tip is to make sure the wet wipes aren't too cold, I know this sounds daft but when my Daughter was still giving me endless dirty nappies at night, I found that it was the coldness of the wet wipes that really woke her up and got her thinking she was ready for a 2am cot party.
U0XdcLfCaa	Honestly, I think that name might give someone a complex, What if he doesn't turn out intelligent? My brother's middle name is Pisipance and he thinks he has to get A's in school all the time.<br>  <br>  It's pretty, but adds a lot of pressure.|`|76hhm6Quaa	You can't be serious, actually I know your not serious because nobody would name their child pisipance (PissyPants). By chance you are serious, your child will grow up to hate you.|`|Qlo4ZWGraa	That is a great name that will insure that the boy never ever gets mocked or made fun of for his name!  Such a gift to a newborn.|`|3e0fb112d935519e50f071750d581bcdaa	Terrible <br>  Just terrible. <br>  <br>  I can hear it now...<br>  "Ooo Pissy pants.."<br>  <br>  And whats a "babby"?!|`|ValLVBcYaa	You do realize nobody finds you even the slightest bit amusing, right?<br>  <br>  I'd suggest you go get a life.|`|tcvQwTa5aa	that kid will be teased forever by any english speaking person,don't do it!|`|e607de785f45933493ee1b1163bf88d9aa	Quite possibly the most dreadful name I've ever heard.

I would pick something that doesn't so|`|21DdpuqEaa	That name should have a meaning .I think its ok  then .But it sound really gayish some how and if it has no meaning drop it .Because your son will  have a hard ti me explaining what it means . Names i Belive make a person's personality and  nor mally i can gues the type of person by his name .So be careful because many people have change their names to have better life end of the day .I m taking of actors and singers and many biz people that I know .You want to be uniquie and yet save wahts its all abt in a name  mate .So good luck|`|cr3kKUEmaa	that is a mean name i can see it now....<br>  Charlie (he has a normal name)- HEY Piss-In-Pants!!! nice name babby boy.<br>  <br>  Pisipance- i'm not a 'babby boy!!!' don't call me that charlie|`|wqeyinGXaa	no it sounds like piss in pants|`|D4XWrwuaaa	No disrespect intended to your culture, but in English it sounds remarkably like Pissy Pants, which would likely get the child teased or worse in school.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Hey Secret, I think he's amusing. Gee, lighten up guys.<br>  <br>  Pisipance Pampersarebest would be a lovely name. It will <br>  'INTELLIGENT COMPANIAN with dry shoes and socks"|`|P9zJmmcMaa	Again my only problem is with your spelling. I prefer "Pissiepanz'e", although I think "Pissypannce" is more traditional.

8KTr8n3kaa	The only thing I know for sure is that fever is a sign of an infection in the body and should be treated with antibiotics if it does not go away on it's own in a few days. <br>  <br>  This happened with my daughter once. She ran a fever for about 3 weeks. She was on three different kinds of antibiotics. Finally the doctor sent her to the emergency room for an antibiotic shot (strong dose) in her backside. This seemed to do the trick. We never did determine the cause of the fever. The doctor thought maybe a urinary or kidney infection. <br>  <br>  Is she currently taking antibiotics? If not, you need to find the right doctor that is willing to help you. Good luck.
jCy0J2ueaa	I think the nuby ones are to much like a bottle. It will become a whole new dependcy. You should not let him suck on a sippy cup all day long. You should only give to him during meals and snacks and maybe while he plays if he gets thirsty but definetly noy at bed time that is bad for his teeth. Sorry if it sounds mean but its the truth|`|oiJITSNZaa	Around 1 year I started using regular cups at mealtimes or when my child was sitting at the table. Otherwise sippy cups come in mighty handy for carrying around the house  even if its just water in them! My 3 1/2 year old I occassionally give one of those disposable sippy cups in the van or when he's sick and want to keep him drinking sorta as a treat.|`|U67DfN5naa	My son was taken off the bottle at one but never liked sippy cups, we tried the nuby ones and hard top ones too, and started using regular cups at 18 months. Once they can hold on to a cup without spilling continuously and not choke when they take a drink, then they can switch to a regular cup, probably around 2-3 years old.|`|6UBSUzUIaa	My son went off the bottle at 11 months, a nipple top sippy cup at 18 mths to a hard topped sippy until 24 mths. He's now using one that has an attached straw. After that he'll go to a cup with a detachable straw then a regular cup. That's how my mom did us and we were drinking out of regular cups at 3. Well, me 3 and my sister 2. <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|KWl605JTaa	umm well my little sister had used a bottle until 8 months then used the nuby brand. she just has like 6 different sippys. some hard tops and some nubys. and sometimes she likes to drink from her "big girl cup" ....a.k.a a regular cup|`|eytlIKITaa	Like when they're 3-4 years old... THAT'S WHEN THEY SHOULD START USING REGULAR CUPS!!!  Why in the heck would I get a thumbs down for that!?<br>  <br>  If you mean a bottle to a sippy cup- I would start giving your baby a sippy at 6 months with water in it just to get them use to it early.  No more bottles after 12 months!

XjcrMNBuaa	salmon twice a week|`|ioZeveazaa	Unfortunately there really isn't anything that can prevent stretchmarks however if your skin is more toned before pregnancy it can help to not get AS many if you do get them. Stretchmarks are alot to do with genes. I have not used my bottle yet because I still have one more week left but try Trilastin SR after you have your baby. It is suppose to help diminish the appearance of stretchmarks which helps. It won't get rid of them but will make them less visible...hopefully. Good luck!!|`|rP6CHrwgaa	Just keep moisturising your body if your meant to have stretch marks u really can't prevent them, keep eating plenty of fruit & veg|`|077a430c1a605554bc4be87a313735a9aa	Stretch marks are genetic and you can not prevent them. You can lessen the effect but if your mother or your fathers mother has them or anyone in your family that has gained and lost weight..... you will have them as well.<br>  <br>  Cocoa butter and bio-oil help with the itching and redness but they nor does anything else prevent them.|`|AA10186411	There is nothing you can do to ultimately prevent stretch marks.

AND, you do not need to gain an *excessive* amount of weight and contribute to the problem.  <br>  Continue with your usual healthy routines of exercise (ok it with your doctor), eat super healthy, and remember you are NOT eating for TWO!!<br>  I gained 20 lbs.(6.14 baby) and 18 lbs. (7.4 baby) -- exercised thru both.<br>  <br>  If you find your skin becoming a big problem, I suggest a combo with a salicylic acid scrub and a lotion with benzoyl peroxide.<br>  (As always, double-check with your doc!)<br>  <br>  Good luck, Sweetie and HAPPY BABY!!!!!   <br>  xoxoxoxoxoxo|`|k2heQRKFaa	you cant really prevent them there is no magic cream. some ppl get them some dont. my sister in law gave birth at 26 weeks she had marks all over her stomach upper thighs hips butt.. she gained 25lbs. ----baby is doing fine by the way :)---  I went to full term i gained 40lbs and I only had a few on my hips and breasts... You would think I would have more since i gained more but not the case. everyones skin is different...You can keep your skin moisturized it cant hurt but I doubt it will prevent them....but dont worry once that baby is born you wont care becuz theyre worth it..they will fade away in time anyways..|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Eat well, don't gain too much weight, and use vitamin E oil on your belly. People say using oil or special lotions don't work, but both my sisters and mom got huge stretchmarks when they were as far along as I am but I haven't gotten any yet. I'm sure I will get some, but not as much as them.|`|nmu6coapaa	Yea, you'll either get stretch marks or you wont! But drink lots of water and just generally eat healthy!

But you cannot fully prevent stretch marks. If it is in your DNA to get them, you will.. No matter how much cream and oil and lotion you put on. But my doctor advised me to keep my skin moisturized to help minimize the appearance of the marks, and that this would also help make the stretching a little less itchy.|`|5jjGo6XTaa	nothing u can do can really stop stretch marks you belly is going it get big no matter what. you can eat healthy all you want but it isnt gonna stop you belly from growing u can try to us coco butter lotion but that really doesnt always cut it and just makes em not so terrible but if ur gonna get em u will with my first baby i got one lil one on each side of my belly with my second i got them bad. wecome to pregnancy|`|cFSpYoDfaa	The key is keeping your skin moisturized by using cocoa butter(palmer's is really good) and Vitamin E, doing this religiously about 3 times a day.

hggYZSyQaa	Delaney Genevieve is a beautiful, graceful name. I adore this name even though I have never even heard of it!<br>  <br>  Here are some more if you wish! :<br>  Girls:<br>  Faith Carmel-Carmel for a middle name and my fave!<br>  Rose Joy<br>  Stephanie Hope<br>  Taylor Swift<br>  Zoe Amelie(or Zoe Britney/Stephanie)<br>  <br>  Boys:<br>  Jordan-no middle names but my fave!<br>  Jason(Jase for short)<br>  Craig<br>  Nathan<br>  Christopher<br>  Darren(Daz for short)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and good-luck!|`|PHyNJHRCaa	My word of advice don't make Delany her first name... it sounds like a surname...<br>  <br>  Genevieve and Evyn are both very pretty names. I like Evyn personally because it's unique and the spelling is very nice. You can even break it down to call her Eve or Evy as a nickname. I think it's a beautiful name.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I like Delany. THat's really cute. You could call her Lainie as a NN. <br>  <br>  How about Genna or Jenna as a derivitive of Genevieve? Or Vivi? Viv?<br>  I would go ahead and name her Geneveive and call her one of the above.|`|1xsUVtzBaa	Delany Genevieve|`|ValLVBcYaa	Evyn Delany! It's so awesome.|`|8CuQa2OJaa	I like Evyn Delany.|`|6098ebd9c2c175997bc815b09ad17e01aa	delany genevieve or geneva|`|wqeyinGXaa	delany genevieve|`|qeVrEYjvaa	Delaney!!!!|`|IYacMZCGaa	i like Delany Genevieve go for it!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	"I gave my sons surnames instead of forenames so my daughter has to have one too, to match." <br>  <br>  Sorry, but that's possibly the most stupid reason I've seen for a dreadful name EVER. Cute? It's just SAD.<br>  <br>  The only combination which isn't hilariously bad is Genevieve Delany. If the poor kid HAS to have a surname in there, at least make it a middle name.<br>  <br>  And no, putting a random y in a boys name does not magically turn it into a girls name. It turns it into a boys name which is spelt wrong.|`|DHwPgw9iaa	I like Evyn Delaney. Very cute!|`|h57t7FAjaa	I'm assuming this is for a girl, given the name Genevieve?<br>  <br>  I think Evyn Delany is cute, are you pronouncing it like Evan?  Only concern here would be that the name would be confused for a boys... but other than that I love it! it's different and the spelling is cute.<br>  <br>  Delany Genevieve just doesn't sound right to me (the flow), genevieve Delany sounds much better, but if it doesnt work with the last name than thats understandable.<br>  <br>  If I had to pick I'd say Evyn Delany.<br>  <br>  & i understand that those are the onyl two choices, but given the names you have chosen, have you considered Delany Evyn?<br>  Also Evyn is a very loose interpretation of Genevieve.  I'm assuming you consider Vivianne then, but I think its much cuter!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|CRvdmFwCaa	I don't think Genevieve is to long for a first name (on HGTV Genevieve Garner... they call her Gen)<br>  <br>  But!!  I like the name combo's you picked out... Very Very cute!<br>  <br>  I think I like Delany Genevieve the best to stick with the Surname as first name thing you have going.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I like Delany or Delanie Genevieve, or about about Delany Evyn? I like that the best!|`|34VXCyvVaa	I LOVE Evyn Delany -- great-sounding name -- but not the spellings.  I think Delaney would be prettier.|`|MSGixNibaa	Hmm, seeing as Delany is a masculine (and misspelled) name and these are your absolute only two choices (though I'm sure you could find a feminine alternative if you wished), I'd much rather see it in the middle name spot.<br>  <br>  Genevieve is gorgeous, feminine, and classy. I don't, howeve,r see the connectection between Evyn and Genevieve? Evyn looks like it is pronounced like the male name Evan and is definitely out for me if you're going with Delany as well. <br>  <br>  Genevieve Delany would be alright, but if you really wanted to make it beautiful, you'd replace Delany, although I'm assuming that is you family name.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	Delany Genevieve has my vote as it's more feminine.  Evyn drives me absolutely nuts because it's becoming unisex and I despise unisex names.  Regardless of how you spell it, it's still pronounced the same as the boys going by Evan, like my nephew.|`|RZQHB0g8aa	I like Delany Genevieve better. Delany is cool and Genevieve is so pretty. I don't like Evyn, sorry. It's kind of weird...|`|DutTBV3caa	Delany Genevieve<br>  that makes me happy because my first name is genevie (no "ve" on the end) and its not a common name but its still pretty :)<br>  anyways, lol, i think its really cute!|`|eV5E9MhUaa	Both first names sound like boy names, and Genevieve sounds like a girl name.

0QYIbn1saa	A few weeks ago I was at Target with my 16-month old, he was sitting in the main part of the cart.  When I went to check out, I was putting things on to the runner and when I turned around I noticed Eli was hunched over really weird and was being really quiet. <br>  <br>  When I turned him around, I realized he had taken the 6-pack of bananas and was eating one RIGHT THROUGH THE SKIN, stuffing it in his face like a little chipmunk!!!  My first reaction was embaressment, but I can laugh about it now :)|`|930a625eb301aae633a9b9d8e18e0752aa	When I worked nights I would get home between 4 and 7 in the morning, and my middle daughter who was 4 at the time was sitting on top of the steps, hands on her hips when I walked in at 5ish. She gave me the dirtiest look and asked "Just where exactly have you been?"<br>  <br>  My oldest daughter and I were rising the bus when she was 3. It had been a long day and she wasn't feeling the greatest. She told me she wanted to go home and relax on the couch. lol I told her she couldn't because the cat ate it. She stayed quiet thinking about it the rest of the way home. Got back, took her stuff off and sat on the couch. It took about 2 minutes before I got a big HEY!! You fibbed!<br>  <br>  Same daughter about a week after that was excited to see the river when we drove over it, and she missed it. I told her someone stole the river and put it in there freezer. She told everyone that the river was gone. The next week we were going over the same river when she declared loudly that she was happy the cops put the river back. <br>  <br>  Middle daughter was 4, and was convinced that Santa got the reindeer to fly by feeding them Christmas ornaments. She was also convinced that if the dog would eat one he could fly too. That poor dog had a ornament shoved in his face every time he went by the Christmas tree. lol He ended up with permanent Christmas issues. <br>  <br>  My youngest, my mom and I were driving through Edmonton and someone cut me off. My mom called them a Redneck (they had a redneck lisence plate) and she pipes up in the back Redneck! Now she has a tendency to call people that when she's upset. Taught me and mom to watch our mouths a little more carefully. She's 2.<br>  <br>  Same daughter bit me a few weeks back and of course I yelled ow!. She told me to "awww...cry about it"<br>  <br>  I have so many funny moments from my girls it's hard to pick just one.|`|AA12145826	When my daughter was about 2 we would place our ottoman against the entertainment unit to keep her away from the cable box, dvd player, etc. It worked for a while, but then one day I noticed she was putting her leg up on it and it looked like she was trying to climb it, but when I said "ah-ha!" She put her hands over her head and said "dass" which I took to mean "dance" or "look Mommy, I'm doing ballet!" I went into the bathroom for a minute to rescue the cat out of the toilet, again....and when I came back Hannah had managed to climb up on the ottoman, but in her haste to get down she had somehow gotten wedged in the pike position, butt down, in between the ottoman & the entertainment center. Her little feet were wiggling around up by her ears and she was giggling, so I didn't panic...in fact I grabbed the camera and took a picture first! It is probably one of the funnier moments....I wish I could have gotten secret video of her doing it, I bet we could have one $10,000 on AFV!! LoL<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Oh I have to add this, santobugito reminded me.....<br>  <br>  We were walking to the ice cream shop and I had to keep reminding Hannah to stop running ahead, especially since we were coming to a cross walk. Well, finally I had enough and I told her to get back with me....as she huffed & puffed her way towards me I heard her mumble "Deal with it!" which happens to be Daddy's favorite phrase when I am frustrated with him. Needless to say he practically fell over laughing and I was trying really hard to keep my composure because my daughter has an angel face and little itty-bitty voice, so it was funny to hear her say that!|`|cYRZpGkqaa	My daughter broke the nipple of her sippy cup, dumped the milk on the floor, then knelt down to slurp it up like a puppy. So funny, it still makes me laugh every time I think about it.|`|PXG43KPRaa	I was in the car with my mother in law and my daughter who was 2 at the time. Someone cut off my mother in law and she yelled G.D. and my daughter who is now 6 said "sh&t, member Grandmary". I thought omg she said it in the right context and she is only 2. The funniest thing about this my mother in law only uses bad language in the car.|`|6iDjNKxHaa	The funniest memory are my three daughters trying to fight to get to me for kiss and huge. The youngest daughter always seem to  be first one.|`|lzivF4Idaa	mmm...last night with his oreo face. he's only 7 months old so liike everyday is a new thing!!!|`|8oAlBL91aa	To this day we always do this too lol. HE was probably about 2 or 3 and something hectic was going on and everyone was all scatted about and kinda yelling at each other not yelling in a bad way but yelling across the room hey do this and my son stops everyone dead and takes his hands and moves them up and down and say "everybody calm down" it was just so cute because here we are a bunch of adults and the 2 year old told us to clam down, so now it's always a joke we always say calm down moving our hands lol, he doesn't find it funny anymore lol. <br>  <br>  Another time I was in kmart and he was again about 2 or 3 and going through a taking off all his clothes stage (hasn't really ever ended lol) and well I was talking to the cashier and I feel this tap on my shoulder and it was an older women standing there pointing to my son who had taken everything off including his undies lol, so of course I quickly dressed him after being sooooo embarrassed lol.
UIILEn0Uaa	girls:  Annie Brooke  boys:  Aiden Jasper  and  Coady Allen|`|1FXXJMy5aa	I think that Annie Brooke is ADORABLE!!! I like Aiden Tyler and Coady Allen but I would spell Coady as Cody or Kody.  Britain is cute too.|`|5Dr5cvkwaa	Aiden Tyler   Julianne|`|UbCzA2JVaa	The girl name I like the most:  Annie Shea.    Annie Brooke just doesn't seem to flow right.  Julian is my dad's name. If you are saying it jul-ee-anne maybe you could spell it Julianne or something different?    The boy name I like the most:  Coady Allen, though I prefer Cody.    I also like Declan John and Aiden Tyler is nice.        :)|`|MSfuRuqCaa	Girl: Annie Shae  Boy: Declan|`|lIKNMErnaa	i agree that coady looks better spelled cody i didnt really like the girl names to much but coady and aiden tyler were the cutes guy names.|`|lGSUToFQaa	Britan Jackson   Aiden Tyler     my picks,   i think aiden is common right now so maybe use it as a middle name|`|ej51eWO7aa	i voted. btw annie laurie sounds better|`|wi4XXfCEaa	I like the name Alexander and the nickname Alex is super cute!|`|vUAjf0t1aa	Aiden is a really, really common name right now. He'll probably be known as Aiden H. Just be aware.|`|gwI5SQ6Iaa	i think you should stay away from aidan/aiden so many people are naming their sons aidan and it's getting annoying lol  but i like:  annie shea and declan john|`|DkVqOe8Iaa	Cody is nicer than Coady.    Julian is masculine.
ANHsv4ENaa	We fight a lot of times to get the school board to allow it. It is illegal not to allow your child into school because they have not been vaccinated. You fill out paperwork, you go to the superintendent or higher if need be. I have quite a few friends who had to go through it every single year. The school threatening etc. but they always, always won.<br>  EDIT*** Since a bunch of people said this I want it explained to me PLEASE!! If my son is not vaccinated how does he pose a threat to your vaccinated child?? YOUR CHILD IS VACCINATED!! If the vaccine does not work and exposure to the disease will still cause your child to catch it WHY DID YOU VACCINATE THEM? Either they work or they don't. You can't have it both ways. If they work you have no worries. If they don't you did a completely useless thing getting them.|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	The laws vary and there are exceptions.  Some children can not get shots b/c of medical reasons, religious reasons, etc.... they can't be denied an education b/c of that.  There are forms and it's a long process.|`|EtCRnDJMaa	they usually give you until the end of the school year to get caught up on dr appointments.  My daughter didn't have her app until like April and they sent a note home reminding me and said just turn it in by the end of May of that year.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	I'm sure it's different in every school district, but I believe that parents of unvaccinated children need to sign a waiver of some kind to get their kids into public schools.|`|j2mRop0laa	Those parents need to have a waver signed. <br>  Our county is trying to force flu shots on everyone, which is all fine and dandy unless you have a child that reacts badly to vaccines (the case with my youngest) and sorry- the principal calls me often to ask me if I have given my kids the flu shots. I tell her nope and there's nothing she can do about it.<br>  <br>  Plus, they are trying to make a second chicken pox shot mandatory and she will not be getting that either. They can threaten away- it will do no good. I will not give her shots.<br>  <br>  *She is up to date on all other shots, against my better judgment. I believe she may be allergic based on her reaction to them.<br>  <br>  BTW: If they do make these things mandatory, I will *get away with it* by knowing my rights. I am the mom- not them. The government does not own my children. I won't be bullied by the schools.|`|vcNvEIOwaa	great question!.....Because its NOT the Law....you can easily get an exempt form (each state is different) but in all states there is some form of exemption. The school won't tell you that though......<br>  <br>  you can find these forms at: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.vaclib.org/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.vaclib.org/index.htm</a><br>  <br>  I do not vaccinate and feel strongly that even if you do choose to vaccinate, you need to know that you don't have to and we all need to fight to keep our choices available. This right is slipping from us quickly..the fact that most vaccinating parents believe or are confused about the right to choose is proof of this...<br>  <br>  Wow....I knew it was bad but I had no clue it was this BAD...most of the answers here are pure ingorance. how do you parents NOT know that you don't need these toxins in your child to attend public school?......this is what happens when everyone relies on someone else to tell them what to do....come on people....wake up and make your own descions!|`|prqrQcd1aa	In my school district the only way a child can not have shots is because of religious beliefs..in other words you would have to explain to them that you do not give your children shots because of your religious views, have a bunch of documents filled out,ect. for a child to be able to go to school... If you simply "do not believe in them" your child is not allowed to go to school with the other children!|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	I always thought that if you didnt want your kids getting shots, all you had to do was sign a form saying that it was against your beliefs. Apparently I was wrong. Most public schools wont allow your children to attend without a certain amount of vaccinations. They say If you dont like it, you can send your kids to a different school i guess|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	Parents who chose not to vaccinate sign get forms for a waiver, based on philosophical and/or religious beliefs, or a medical waiver (which is issued if the child can not receive vaccines on the recommended schedule).  Unvaccinated children CAN and DO attend school.|`|AA11296044	Parents who do not believe in shots need to plead their case tot he board and have a special exemption.<br>  <br>  The school does not have to accept kids who are not vaccinated as it is a risk to the health and safety of the other children.|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	They are not allowed to do that.<br>  <br>  My 5yo is only up to the 1 year mark on his Vaccinations. It's my right as a Parent to give them when I want or at all.<br>  <br>  You only need a Doctors certificate, and they cannot do a thing|`|FvYqKZSMaa	They cant kick him out.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	wow really? where are america's good old civil rights?? LmaO|`|USoqyjaAaa	It depends on the laws of the state.  Some states are more lenient and allow any personal objection (like Ohio).  Others require a bona fide religious or medical exception. The few parents whose children are not protected by vaccination must request an exemption in writing.  Unless such documentation for a waiver or proof of vaccination are submitted, the child may be denied entry.  However, a school should be able to grant you a period of time to comply with the request.|`|VBgzgoUMaa	You can get him into a School that doesn't get funded by the government THAT will cost you though<br>  <br>  Smedrik is right, you MIGHT be able to get an exemption but you BETTER have a much BETTER excuse than.......you just do not Believe in them.......they will just assume you are ignorant about it.........they give you a DEAD germ, to produce antibodies, the GERM they vaccinate you with is not HARMFUL it is virtually DEAD|`|kjgonYlgaa	The same way they get the schools to stop saying the lord's prayer,  From singing the national anthem, to change the name of French fries,  To not have to wear mandatory attire, dress, uniforms, fireman's helmets,police hats, RCMP hats etc... Religion!  People are invited to live in Countries they are not from and then think we need to change the rules to the rules they were getting away from in their own countries!   It's all alot of b...s...!|`|irLnPW4aaa	At least in my state, if the child's doctor or the parent writes a letter stating that the parent has decided (for whatever reason) not to vaccinate the child, then the child is still allowed into school.  There are actually a lot of children whose parents object to vaccinations (I know a family with a child that had a bad reaction to vaccines and none of the other children in that family have ever had any vaccines as a result) and they are all in school.|`|h46SsYoBaa	I am a school secretary. They cannot kick him out. Ask for a immunization waiver form from the office at school... They don't like to tell you about those :)|`|W6S6WpsNaa	Do some research, because I heard that its against the law to not let kids attend school.  I'm not sure, so check it out.|`|68ff65056801d41cd24d55b5ee0516a2aa	One of my children is adopted and we adopted him at age 3.  All of his shots before he was about 2 1/2 are a mystery.  When I enrolled him in kindergarten, first at public school, then at a charter school, they wanted those mysterious shot records, that, as far as I'm concerned, don't exist.  I told them that there is no possible way for me to find out if/when those shots took place, and they just had me fill out that waiver form, even though he is current on everything from age 2 1/2 to now, I still had to fill out that form.  <br>  <br>  They said at the school, they can't force you to get your kids vaccinated, and while I believe in vaccinations, I understand everyone doesn't, for religious reasons or whatever else.

hl5WdXnbaa	most families do not get back more than what they pay in. That would be the exception and not the rule.<br>  <br>   So what if they get big refunds, they need it! Not everyone who is working "poor" is lazy.  My husband is a full time police officer and he makes 36, 000 a year, just above that mark and I would love for anyone to call New York City police officers that they are lazy!   I guess my college educated husband should get a job making money and worrying about being greedy instead of working to protect the community. ( the lazy comment was not at the Original asker  but another comment btw)  I work too...and guess how much we got back last year, 150$ and we have 4 kids.<br>  <br>   I rather see a working family get the money than welfare who do nothing. I can think of a million places I rather not spend our money, like billions a month for a war in Iraq or millions and millions to land crap on Mars.|`|0f2deb09ad21a9b193c5c032d99753f9aa	I would not have a problem with that, as in my opinion they need the money.    What I have a problem with is the people earning very high levels of income that also pay hardly any tax because alot of the tax laws favour them and they are able to find loop holes.|`|cAtWxJG1aa	surely it's not correct that "most" families get back more than they paid in? that is the case only for very low-income families, on the theory that they'd need that income from our tax dollars one way or another.<br>  <br>  considering how many things tax dollars are used for, i'm sure all of us can find things in the budget that we personally wouldn't want to be paying for.  but i have no quibble with some of my income being used for common causes through taxes.  indeed, if we weren't all paying personal income taxes, presumably employers would simply pay people less because we'd have the same spending power for the same amount of work and would be willing to put up with it.|`|0781f56992749b6d9de1b9aa61424bbbaa	The amount of a tax refund is not an indication of the total amount of taxes paid or the taxation rate for that tax payer.  <br>  <br>  That same hypothetical family could pay the same amount of taxes at the same tax rate, but get no refund at all, if they claimed a different number of exemptions on their W-2.<br>  <br>  ETA: And, no matter what tax rate you pay, everyone has an equal voice in our government - rich or poor.|`|0TGpz08paa	I am sorry but I am 22 and a single working mom of my three and a half year old daughter.

I don't  mooch off of the government, and whatever they send me, I don't complain.|`|MPX0f5jzaa	You are sadly misinformed if you think anyone gets back anything they didn't overpay in the first place.  Where are you getting this from?  Do you have an example or a source?<br>  <br>  And BTW, they're paying 1/3 of their income into the government in the first place.  The government doesn't pull money out of its ears!  Jeez, the ignorance!<br>  <br>  I can't believe what I'm reading here, do people actually believe this drivvel?|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I never understood why those that WORK and pay taxes don’t get a decent refund back. It’s like the more babies you make, the less money you have, the more they give you. <br>  <br>  It ticks me off. But you know what? 99% of the things that tick me off are out of my control. So I just drink instead! LOL!<br>  <br>  ** ADD **<br>  <br>  While some people are legit with their finances, do we know how many people LIE and are sitting back not working just because? Like what’s the reason for the low income? Is it low because they CHOOSE to sit home? Or is it low because they work but don’t make anything more because they simply can’t? Is it low because they don’t budget accordingly? Would they rather stay home and get benefits and tax returns than go and educate to attempt make more money? <br>  <br>  I guess once that can be determined, and we can filter out those that abuse the system in regards to “low income”, then I’m all for it. But when you have so many people who don’t budget accordingly, and spend beyond their means to put them in that spot, I’m not so sure I can 100% support that.|`|41980ab28e587a42197eea5a921bca4aaa	I spend every dime I have taking care of my kids and my sick husband.

Sometimes we don't choose to be in the circumstances that we are.  My husband didn't choose to get sick.  He didn't choose to almost die.  He would love to be working right now, but that's not an option for him.  So, I support the family on my own.<br>  <br>  And you probably have twice as much money as me even after you pay all of your taxes and I get my refund.

If this really were a business, then maybe you would have a point, but it isn't.

I don't think someone that keeps having child after child that works but still gets welfare deserves a big tax return. I think all single parents deserve a big tax return.

BHkaULukaa	Having a child in my extended family with autism and having watched it appear, I believe that the vaccine was a catalyst, but not the cause.  Before he received the vaccine, he was beginning to talk and was affectionate.  After the vaccine he stopped talking and was no longer affectionate and began to show signs of autism.  He had been sick in the week prior to his vaccination and we are told not to vaccinate when a child has been sick.  When I went in for my son's shots recently, the nurse refused to give a child his immunization because that child had a fever.  They said to come back at a time when the child was healthy.<br>  I think that there are a lot of things we put into our bodies that aren't good for us and that pinpointing one single thing that's the cause of autism is not going to be an easy task.|`|LWxEbK31aa	There may well be a small link to autism in there but the fact still remains that the number of related autism cases are extremely minimal compared to the amount of lives the vaccine has saved.  Now that parents are fearing the MMR jab the cases of potentially fatal measles is once again rising to a dangerous level.|`|ZtCyxfpfaa	I feel there is definitely a connection. Countries that don't use the vaccines have very little to no cases of autism.|`|iu4SOin3aa	I don't think so. I think many of these parents are devastated by the fact that their child is autistic and looking for someone to blame it on. Instead of putting their money up to go to court and for lawyers and such, they could be spending it on therapy or something for their child. <br>  <br>  I have a 14 month old, and we get him all his shots when they're due.<br>  <br>  I feel like these shots are a good thing, meant to keep children healthy, and all this controversy will end up leading to some kind of epidemic with parents not taking their kids for the shots.<br>  <br>  Better safe than sorry.|`|oKoEYukpaa	"BTW, MARYLAND would not let ANYONE out of vaccinating their children. There are states where you cannot "opt out".<br>  "Get your child vaccinated or go to JAIL""<br>  <br>  Free will to not vaccinate your child = move to another state with different laws. That is why the US is the greatest country in the world, becasue you CAN move to another state where you agree with the law without having to leave the country. Isn't free will great? It's your choice and don't let anybody tell you different.|`|6UBSUzUIaa	I personally don't beleive vaccines cause autism. I believe that is something children are born with, because they show signs before they receive shots.|`|6ErVPePEaa	I do not think vaccines causes autism. My son was diagnosed with autism at 12 months. he showed signs way before he ever got the mmr shot. I think those parents are just so stressed in not knowing what causes it that they will put blame on anything. Vaccines do not cause autism.....................................<br>  <br>  They are saying that it is the mmr shot... my son did have vaccines before the mmr shot. I was not vaccinated during or right before  I was pregnant. I believe autism has something to do with genetics, environment, or something in the brain does not fully develop during pregnancy|`|Nux5S6oVaa	I've done a lot of research as is was the topic of one of my papers in nursing school.<br>  <br>  I think the benefits outweigh the risks.  I come from a community where there is a lot of Amish...and they don't vaccinate against anything and as a pediatric RN I have watched countless babies battle illnesses that sweep through their communities and some do die.  It's sad, because they could of be prevented with a shot or two.<br>  <br>  I'm 26 years and have been vaccinated against everything, including menigitis(I developed an adverse reaction and ended up in the hospital but- that didn't discourage me), Gardasil...and many others.  I have absoluately no health problems nor does my family. And I was vaccinated before they took Thimerosal out, Thimerosal is what has been linked to autism...I do think there is a link between certain genes and autism.  Just like you said, unfortunately, there is different cases.  Some may have been caused by the vaccination as how can we know how a baby will react, everyone has different drug allergies and we don't even want to go into what is in some of your common drugs.  Formaldhyde and aluminum are in such small amounts to preserve the virus (whether live or inactive), they are in safe amounts.  Just think if you use deoderant everyday...did you know you are rubbing aluminum on your skin? And there is a small link to breast cancer? <br>  The truth is that someone somewhere is going to find something wrong with just about everything...Gosh-What were they saying about milk in plastic containers the other day?  The question is...it is a money making scheme or is it a safety issue.  The truth is, no one knows for sure. And a decision has to be made...do you believe a traditional doctor or do you go with Dr. Tenpenny?  The choice is yours, but I what I think is... So you don't vaccinate and there is an outbreak of Measles (I know, slim chance) and your child dies, but your neighbor vaccinated and her child lives...do you think it's a moral dilema? And how would you feel?  Would it end in yet another lawsuit against Dr. Tenpenny? Who knows?<br>  <br>  It's a debate they cannot be settled overnight and someone is always going to be unhappy. As you are, you ask a question and then judge someone by saying they are putting "poison" in their child because of their choice...<br>  <br>  I'm a Pediatric Nurse in the states...and vaccines aren't mandatory.  You can get an exempt for religious beliefs if you child is to attend public school. <br>  <br>  I'm 9wks 5days with my first and I'll be vaccinating, because in my heart I can't take the risk of not.  And the chances of autism is so slim...I think it's worth it, but- It's a personal decision!<br>  <br>  I'm all for homeopathic methods which is what Dr. Tenpenny has an degree in and believes, but I'm not willing to hope colloidal silver will save me if there is an outbreak of some "virus" that could've been vaccinated against.|`|yzakyjNKaa	getting vaccines have nothing to do with autism these parents are just trying to blame someone   because there child has a disability what they need to  do is spend that money that they are using to sue these people a get there child the help they need  and not waste it on something they choose to have done   they could have refused those vaccines  but didnt  they should have researched them before hand and made a wise choice<br>  <br>  i would rather have an autistic child then a dead child  either way i love my 2 children more then anything else on this earth<br>  <br>  actually you can reject  them  they will have you sign some papers  so they don't get sued|`|YkseyT7zaa	No|`|AjqO1aJgaa	I think some people need to learn the difference between "coincidence" and "caused by". Of course a lot of kids will start showing symptoms of autism right after they have the jab - most kids show the symptoms around the time the jab is given!<br>  <br>  Look at the figures. It's actually slightly LESS likely that your child will become autistic if they have the MMR jab.<br>  <br>  Then read the article. The baby in question sadly had a very rare reaction to the vaccine which caused severe BRAIN DAMAGE. It's a known possible side effect, and the only correlation with autism is that one of the symptoms of the brain damage is technically on the autism spectrum.<br>  <br>  "the MMR had directly caused a brain inflammation illness called acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) which, in turn, had caused the autism spectrum disorder PDD-NOS in the child"<br>  <br>  Then stop scaremongering. We all know that, very sadly and very rarely, kids can have severe adverse reactions to vaccines. It's a risk we all take, because it's less than the risk of severe reactions to the illnesses vaccinated against. It has NOTHING to do with healthy kids developing autism as a result of being vaccinated.

It has a beautiful meaning and the nn for it is adorable.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I don't like it at all... it is not a very good name..|`|FvYqKZSMaa	Its ok.|`|5vtVsqx6aa	I don't think Haven is awful or terrible!  It's actually gaining popularity and I think it flows with your other names.<br>  <br>  Avi is a pretty nickname, too.<br>  <br>  Go with it!  If you've been holding onto it and thinking of it for awhile, then it's probably special. :o)<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|wma3cn1Haa	I think the name is adorable. And I like you're other three, however I think you will know what name to use when the time comes :3. Its a instinct.|`|95M9WTqoaa	i think if you like it you should use it<br>  it doesnt matter if it "goes" with the other names you choose, they dont have to match.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	Haven is a darling anme! I like it. I don't see how you get the NN Avi out of it though- that doesn't make much sense to me.|`|ValLVBcYaa	I actually really love it!<br>  But never a name a child while planning on giving it a nickname. It's so pointless. You want your kid named Ava, then call her Ava.<br>  <br>  But anyway, Haven is cute!|`|nfLyS1toaa	actually that would have been my second sons name if he was a girl. i was dead set on it.|`|exRohsTEaa	i love the name haven.. its pretty.<br>  but it works for a boy or a girl..<br>  i dont like the nicknames at all..!|`|IYacMZCGaa	i like it..what are the other names?|`|jEhIDpsdaa	I think the name is lovely. It sounds peaceful and loving. I don't know what your taste in names is but mine is usually very romantic but I like this name a lot|`|47M20WOUaa	Not to not to bad I kinda like it :) I also like you other names as well|`|1xsUVtzBaa	I think it would be best as a middle name ..i like the name Ava.
AA11763588	Sperm has to enter the vagina to get pregnant.     If you swallowed then it would just go in your belly.    In the future, when you are ready to have sex, find out how the body works. It will only help you in the end.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	0%|`|3CG3rby0aa	O to no chance.  u r fine.|`|NIuIBCslaa	No- birth control doesn't give you a period if you're pregnant.    :)     Chance you're pregnant: veryyy unlikely.   Your tummy is probably like that for a different reason...
Ccq8zEcnaa	You're at that stage in pregnancy where all you want to do and feel like doing is nothing. I am 34 weeks and am still working.. It's very hard some days to drag my big waddling self to work, but I do. I find that eating a breakfast full of proteins like scrambled eggs really helps. And I keep snacks on hand to eat throughout the day to combat my exhaustion, like cashews, granola bars, cereal bars, fruits, etc.|`|AA10953561	It hits women at different times. I've been feeling that way for the last three weeks or so. Your body is growing a baby and that baby will be taking a lot out of you! It's only natural to feel tired.<br>  <br>  Try to eat healthy, it'll boost your energy and focus. If at all possible try taking short naps each day or even when you get home in the evening and just lay down for a little while.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|buoqtZeFaa	It's not just you I am almost 31 weeks and for some reason I can't concentrate on work at all.  I feel like I have so many other things going on right now and like you I am just tried and lazy lol.  It's has gotten so bad for me today that I left my purse at home and I NEVER do anything like that.  My purse is like my security blanket.  So I am sitting at work with no money or ID lol.|`|Y5NXQ0JPaa	I am sure it is normal. Some people start earlier or more towards the end. I guess it varies. Try to take some naps during the day and get enough sleep at night. Walks also help and give you energy. Well Congratulations and Good Luck!!!!|`|28QPS6V9aa	lol I'm always like that! Hence the reason why I'm on yahoo. :) It's just part of being pregnant. It takes a lot of energy to make a baby.|`|E9MF18FRaa	well i think its normal ive been the same way just a bit and have a feeling it will get worse im 13 weeks so i guess it is normal
LzgkfEGPaa	abcs at 2<br>  count to ten at a little before 2<br>  colors at 3 she had a tough time with brown and black<br>  shapes 3<br>  I taught her|`|68c6B8dRaa	ABCs around 15mo, shapes 16mo, colours and numbers closer to 17mo.<br>  <br>  We read a lot of books and talk a lot at home.|`|t1fx6kXcaa	My son is 23 months old.<br>  I read with him and teach him numbers, colours, shapes, alphabet on a daily basis but, although he loves reading, he is more interested in cars, hands on play and boisterous physical activity than memorising the alphabet. <br>  He knows which letters some words start with. Does not know the entire alphabet.<br>  Can not count to ten. He can count to 5 and knows, for example, that a car has four wheels, a spider has 8 legs etc<br>  I don't know what age he learnt shapes. He has a good understanding of shapes. Knows what a pentagon is and an octagon is etc and knows how many sides they have. Knows a rectangle has 2 long sides and two short sides and he can draw a circle and attempts to draw a triangle and square.<br>  He knows a few colours but doesn't seem to recognise many.<br>  I want my son to learn through experience rather than just memorising numbers, letters etc. So my son learns letters, numbers, shapes through puzzles, blocks etc. He's learning colours through painting. He's learning at his own pace and I don't want to push him. If he's not interested in learning the alphabet etc, than I stop teaching it to him and we do something he enjoys.<br>  EDIT: I'm alwas a tad sceptical when a parent says that their young toddler can count/read etc. Eg; a 14,15,16 month old "knowing" numbers is unlikely. There is a big difference between understanding and simply memorising.<br>  This is interesting:<br>  "If you have a baby and a few years to spend, you can try this experiment at home. Every day, show you baby a bowl of marbles and ask her to give you one. Wait until your baby can do this. This actually takes some time, during which you'll either get nothing or maybe a handful of marbles. <br>  <br>  Then, one day, between 24 and 30 months of age, your toddler will hand you a single marble. But ask for 2 marbles or 3 marbles, etc., your toddler will give you a handful. The number of marbles won't be systematically larger if you ask for 10 than if you ask for 2. This is particularly odd, because because by this age the child typically can recite the count list ("one, two, three, four..."). <br>  <br>  Keep trying this, and within 6-9 months, the child will start giving you 2 marbles when asked for, but still give a random handful when asked for 3 or 4 or 5, etc. Wait a bit longer, and the child will manage to give you 1, 2 or 3 when asked, but still fail for numbers greater than 3. <br>  <br>  This doesn't continue forever, though. At around 3 years old, children suddenly are able to succeed when asked for any set of numbers. They can truly count. (This is work done by Karen Wynn some years ago, who is now a professor of psychology at Yale University.)"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/how-do-children-learn-count-part-1-14759.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.scienceblog.com/cms/how-do-ch...</a>|`|b5ad6e44e0086d316700f9b6713407c6aa	At 18 months my son knew his abcs, could recognize and say the colors orange and blue, recognized and said circle and triangle, and could count to 3.<br>  By his 2nd birthday he knew all colors but purple and gray (I think those ones confused him haha), recognized all shapes but couldn't distinguish between pentagon, hexagon, and octagon yet. I think he could count to ten by then as well. A few months after his 2nd birthday he knew all shapes, colors, and could count to 12.<br>  <br>  I taught him those things, and maybe I was just lucky, but it wasn't work at all. We read a lot of books about those things, sang the abc song several times a day, and whenever we sat down a drew together I would draw shapes and tell him the shape and color. I also used to count his toes in the bath. He picked up on it all really well.|`|d666c2be64ceba00657540ace50128e4aa	My daughter learned primary colors around 18 months (at her daycare).  She TRULY learned the alphabet song, to count to 20, shapes, the Pledge of Allegiance, several new songs as well as a dinner-time prayer (and so much more she learns every day) once she entered the 2 year old class room at her daycare.  Of course we practice with her at home as well, we do it in fun ways though so she enjoys it and stays interested.|`|174a0c67c52bf2d640d056db3d05e137aa	my daughter is 2 1/2 years old and can't do anything like that. she goes to speech next Friday march 6th and see what we can do to help her.|`|EIINtnIpaa	my cousins and i learned at about 1 and a half years old|`|bjGNV81uaa	My son could point to the basic shapes around 18 mo. Colors were a little more difficult for him, so it was probably closer to 2 years before he got those down. He could sing the ABC song by 2 1/2 or so, and probably could count to 10 around then too. But my best friend's son can't do any of that, except his colors and maybe a couple of shapes, and he's 2 1/2 right now. So it's just different for every kid.<br>  <br>  Oh, and my son learned from us reading books together and playing with different toys. He hasn't gone to preschool at all.|`|pV0LhjoKaa	I have a child care with two 23 month old boys and one of them has known how to count to ten and the abcs(the song) for months now.  He also knows a few colors and shapes.  Both his parents and I work with him on this.  But the other boy doesn't know any of these yet.  He is just totally not interested in learning and runs off when I'm trying to read to them.  Every child learns at their own pace.|`|8jlOGOAeaa	My daughter is almost 27 months......<br>  <br>  ABC's~ She has gotten to c....LOL<br>  Count to ten~ She has been counting to 10 since she was about 23 months old.<br>  Colors~ Around 20 months. <br>  Shapes~ She can point out all shapes, and draw's circles and squares.<br>  <br>  All taught by me. She doesn't attend preschool and even if she did, I wouldn't leave it up to them to teach her.

AA11763588	The baby would be a C-shape with a top, bottom, front and back. A groove has developed on the embryo's back.    Your DR may point out the yolk sac too.|`|FjGeKhY0aa	I had mine at 5 weeks too, I didn't see anything besides a dark sack. I'm not sure why your doctor wants to see a heartbeat as I think it is too early. I saw mine at almost 8 weeks. But better to check then wait and wait!

SEzIkGNiaa	There are so many things you could do with them!:<br>  <br>  Bake: Baking is fun for any ages and for girls and boys. You can make something simple like cookies or muffins. To make things easier, you could buy the mixes at a grocery store.<br>  <br>  Board Games: Puzzles, snakes and Ladders, and any board games they have. Card Games<br>  <br>  Arts and Crafts: You can buy some neat things at the dollar store.<br>  <br>  Play Doh<br>  <br>  Movie Night: Wach a movie and eat popcorn<br>  <br>  Color: Have the kids divide a paper in two. On each side have them draw and color their foods the like and on the other, dislike. You could also print out coloring sheets from home (princess, hannah montana, spiderman, ect...)<br>  <br>  Play Outside: Hula Hoop, hopscotch, sidewalk chalk, jump rope, skateboard, sports ect....|`|joiacDUdaa	Well, if you have  a dining room table.. Cover it with a disposible table cloth and color, or fingerpaint or draw with crayons... Read books or make-up fun stories... Make homemade playdoh... Get some clay and model some figures... If you have a video camera make your own music video's and lipsync.  *this is especially FUN but, can come back to "haunt" you as a young adult.... !  Play dress up- <br>  <br>  good luck|`|AR683Nz6aa	i would go for something with arts and crafts in, ie painting, drawing, making something fun like a piggy bank or a card..... this has no age limits.|`|AA10495187	Play sports, such as basketball, and soccer; or play video games.|`|ISPIa0n5aa	buy a craft book for children.  you'll have TONS of FUN!!  :)
a41163f923db4d89fc14dd1b1d973de3aa	Hi,<br>  <br>  My son is 9 months and has never slept through the night.  On our good nights he wake 2 times and on the bad he wake 9 times.  He uses milk as a comforter which is the worse thing and we are really trying to break it so if you can stay clear of that I would.  According to my HV sometimes babies do start waking after 6 months even if they had previously slept through - perhaps try giving your hv a call?|`|KOwzDLPdaa	It is possible he is just going through a growth spurt and is genuinely hungry. Give him a bottle with water in it and if he rejects it, you know he is truly hungry.|`|yUyx2nhmaa	don't feed him!!!! he'll get into a routine of waking for it. you could try a dream feed? or more solids. what time does he wake? how about a dummy or a cuddle?|`|vue9NOhYaa	If he needs comfort, why would you deny that to him?  It's not at all unusual for a 7 month old to need to eat at night, even if he's been sleeping through before.  So, whether it's food or comfort, meet his needs and he'll begin sleeping through again when he's able.<br>  <br>  (BTW, 24 ounces of formula is a bit low.  He might be waking because he isn't getting enough to eat. Try offering more formla during the day.)|`|AA11981363	If he is crying is because he is hungry, so give him a bottle. For god's sake do not leave him to cry...he is hungry, and at 7 months old babies get a growth spurt, so of course he feels like he wants to eat!! <br>  <br>  Babies go thorugh different phases, even my 2 yo daughter will get her sleep all funny sometimes....you have a long way ahead.
aQ8o4w3Xaa	You're lucky she's open with you about this. She must trust you a lot...which is good! <br>  Just have a talk with her and ask her whether or not she does plan on having sex. Depending on her answer, take it from there. She needs to know she can come to you for advice and support. If she is planning to have sex within the next few months, put her on birth control. It's far better she's protected and is honest about having sex than lies and isn't protected.<br>  <br>  In all honesty, if she truly wants to, no amount of parental advice will stop her. Sorry but its true. At that age nothing my parents said would, or did, stop me. They were oblivious to it at the time, but had they known nothing they said would have stopped me. Just make sure you keep and eye on her and keep the lines of communication open.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  :)|`|tiW6RAfLaa	well im fifteen and half of my friends already had sex!!! yeah i know very young. anyways just talk to her and be like im glad you told me this, just please wait till your really happy with someone.. it will be much worth it|`|0udjgaoBaa	I lost mine at 14. I wish my mom had talked to me more about sex and got me some protection...Shes gonna do it with or without youre permission. Take her to get on b.c. and get her some condoms. Go to borders or something and ask for books on the subject. Just be there for her but dont tell her everything she wants to hear. Tell her what guys will say to get into her pants etc. Good luck!|`|BkdZq0QPaa	just tell her she should save herself for someone specail and its not something to play around with, at least she was honest with you, i'd suggest you get her to a doctor though for some info on birth control if she does go that far<br>  and even if you dont communicate well you need to tell her mom that you dont appreciate that amount of freedom<br>  you dont want your daughter to be easy and a teenage mom with chlamydia|`|hsyI1DxDaa	"Just talk to her. At least she came to you & told you. Keep telling her that she can feel comfortable talking to you. Keep the door open!"<br>  <br>  This answerer nailed it - at least she told you, which means she really trusts you. Better than finding out by her getting pregnant. Just educate her on STDs and pregnancy, and give her condoms and birth control. To be honest, I don't think any 'omg don't have sex' talk will stop her.|`|E6T9DPT9aa	Well at least she is being honest with you!<br>  <br>  I'd say put her on birth control and buy her condoms!<br>  <br>  This way, you'll know that she won't get pregnant and she's safe from STIs. Even though you won't like it, it has to be done. You don't want to be a grandfather at your age, do you?<br>  <br>  Talk to her mother about what's been going on.<br>  <br>  Better safe than sorry. <br>  <br>  All my best (:<br>  E-mail me if you want to know anything else (:|`|OIS808Qmaa	Wow - first of all, let me tell you that you are raising your daughter the right way.  I for one would never have felt comfortable talking to my Dad about these things.  Getting upset with her is not the solution, as what she's feeling is natural.  She obviously knows she isn't ready, if she didn't allow it to happen and felt that she could talk to you.  I think you need to do some research together on all the different STD's and other life changing results of having sex.  I believe you can even go to Planned Parenthood, they have courses where they teach young kids along with their parents.  Just keep the lines of communication open with her, and let her know she can always come to you for anything.  Good luck!|`|7WcfzvPvaa	I think at this point all you can really do is have a frank, honest talk with her about why is it good to wait, safe sex and stds.  Talk to her about how 14 year old boys are, and how she will regret it later if she does it now.  You can look into counseling or the help of a female friend (other than mom) to talk to her also.  If you are interested in birth control, you can talk to her doctor or take her to Planned Parenthood.   Plannedparenthood.org|`|Zexhg9Lbaa	Wow, you are really a good mom, and i think she loves you a lot, because almost girls wouldn't talk about these kind of things to their parents until they are pregnant.<br>  So tell her problems about carrying a baby at her age and also tell her about deadly effects of unprotected sex, i mean sex deceases. <br>  Good luck|`|3Sj3F2A4aa	telling her that pre maritial sex is bad is a mistake why lying!<br>  i am fourteen and i would like my father to tell me that i must be aware of the consecuences that can bring, tell her that she must be confident and responsable when this things happen that her partner must be someone she trusts and loves.. and if shes not sure about these things that she must wait and do it when shes prepared....<br>  And above all the things that you are going to be always there to hel?p her..<br>  But telling her that pre maritial sex is bad is a mistake...<br>  I think...<br>  ?<br>  Goo Luck<br>  i hope this helps you|`|bVaZ72f3aa	honestly?<br>  u cant stop her,in reality its impossible..<br>  if she wants to do it then she will, esp that she stays with her mom and she accepts it.<br>  HOWEVER !<br>  all u can do,is speak to her about it....dont get into the details i.e vaginas  etc etc bcoz she knows all that at 14..and she defo has one..<br>  BUT keep th door open for her to talk to you anytime,about ANYTHING !<br>  BUT....make sure she knows the results of sex,unless(not always) using contraception.<br>  as a girl myself,a girl her age being on the pill does not change anything.actually it helps,usually with strong periods and acne...but also protects her against pregnancy(99% of the time)... so there really is no reason why she could not go on it. i know as a parent u will feel odd with the idea,like my mom did...i am currently 15 and staying a virgin for a very long time ! BUT its for acne and my mom does not know..this is bcoz she prefers to scream instead of listen...<br>  thats why u need to be close,and seems like u already are sine ur a man and she admitted it toy you NOT her mom !<br>  and she came to u for help or a conversation....<br>  good luck...<br>  u sound like an amazing dad i never had..|`|WJX994D2aa	Sadly there is nothing you can do to stop her, but tell her she risks having an Sexually transmitted infection if the guy does not use a condom. And tell her " if you're going to have sex, make sure the guy uses a condom."|`|W6S6WpsNaa	Just talk to her.  At least she came to you & told you.  Keep telling her that she can feel comfortable talking to you.  Keep the door open!|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	guide her and be a good counselor to her|`|LZAF4DYZaa	Well 1st of all it's great that you have open communication! I think the idea here to remember is that if her mother is allowing such behavior at her home, it may be something that is much deeper than just "hey you're not ready for sex so don't do it", I think maybe the mother needs to be more of a parent and less of a "best friend". Even though it seems you have your side of the parenting field taken care of, doesn't sound like she does. So if your daughter is getting conflicting responses from either parent, that's where you need to start.|`|54jMklgyaa	i think you should put her on birthcontrol....i mean shes says she almost had sex what if she does and get pregnant at 14 youcan't stop her from having sex, but she to young to have children put her on birthcontrol, if you don't you will prolly evd up having kids, and educated her on sex the consequences, she prolly doesnt no what shes doing, i think thats the best idea. =] good luck|`|txv7TIgiaa	my sister is 14 and has a 18yr boyfriend and i worry about her everyday... the best thing you can do is teach her about all the std's, and risk both physical and emotional... and try to be open so that she wont hide stuff from you...no matter how you really feel... and if she is sextally active get her on the pill or something but try to get her to use condoms too because the pill only prevents pregnancy...|`|HHniTZTbaa	i'm less than a month away from being 14. don't do anything like make her watch it! don't make it awkward, be direct. but don't drag out a whole conversation. say that you want limited time with her boyfriend or whoever she nearly had it is. i know that like dads would feel so protective over their daughters. but they still love their fathers, and experience is what they need with boys. good luckk|`|QJf2XNaTaa	Hey, at least she was comfortable enough to tell you about it! I think that you and her mom should get on the same front and go from there. Don't ban your daughter from the guy either, it usually just draws the 2 of them closer.|`|1mvW2PHPaa	You can watch this site <a href="http://www.exclusivestarvideo.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exclusivestarvideo.com/</a> and be happy!
muBb414baa	Hey Tabitha<br>  <br>  I ovulated on the 15th and i have had cramps ever since. they seem to fade in and out but they defitiely are there along with a pinching sensation about an inch below my belly button. I havent had ANY implantation bleeding but only 1 in 3 get it. I also was experiencing all day nausea for like 4 days with heaving and vomitting.  almost like feeling seasick. Ive had other symptoms too but we are talkin about u.. it could be promising.. i mean you seem to be having similar symptoms. have you checked you cm and/or temp?<br>  <br>  Hope this is our month!|`|tdNfQWaAaa	I have been wondering the same thing, I've been having cramps the last 2 days.

Babies are a LOT of work, and require more financial and time then what you and your girlfriend may be able to give. She'll soon realize that  that is not what she's searching for like I did.

Qe9rXFm0aa	Well normally, right after you give birth..they start the clean up process..then they diaper them..and put them in a hospital provided (long sleeve) tshirt..put a hat on them and swaddle them...  It takes a little while..b/c they have other things they have to do also..like put hospital bands on the baby...  I would say within 30min they'll be swaddled and done with most hospital stuff..    but it all depends on the baby..if they are having a health issue..you never how long things can take|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Well, from my experience - my daughter was handed to me pretty much as soon as she was born (so all covered in stuff), her weight was taken when she was half an hour old (during which time she was cleaned and put into a towelling blanket). She was about an hour old when we dressed her into a babygro, socks and cardi. While you're on the ward in hospital, they don't need many layers because they are usually kept at a constant temperature (the ward that is).   Congrats :)    ETA: My daughter wasn't bathed at the hospital, she was just rubbed down so to speak. She got a bath when we got home, but every hospital is different.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Well in my experience, having a c-section, the nurses gave him a swab down, put a diaper on him and swaddled him in a blanket almost immediately.  But because he was premature he had to be checked out by a NICU doctor immediately after birth, so he was over on the side of the room anyway.  I believe in cases of vaginal birth of a full-term infant they let you hold the baby for a while immediately if that is your preference.    They don't like to clean them too much, actually.  Some of the baby  gunk they come out with is good for their brand new skin.  Honestly, the nurses really take care of your baby in any way you need help with. They put him in a tiny kimono shirt at some point and we took him home in that, a diaper and a swaddle.  It was in the middle of a heat wave.    Bring a nice outfit if you want something special to take him home in, but otherwise don't worry too much about it.|`|Vh5DrXvOaa	Most hospitals here in the states, have paper shirts and hospital issued blankets they put the babies in. I would take baby wipes and the outfit you want to bring baby home in and a warm blanket.

oiJITSNZaa	Maybe a reward system? A chart that  gets a mark each time he pees then if he goes a whole day a small reward? I know my boy was 3 and I was at my wits end because he went when he felt like it. then one day he was potty trained! and never an accident again so i guess its true that when your child is ready it will happen! Good luck!|`|6UBSUzUIaa	I am with Dr. Jeanie. That's what worked for my son. We always gave praise for it.

They will go when they are ready I promise. Kids can be complicated huh? LOL.<br>  <br>  Best of Luck!<br>  Hope this Helps!|`|LzgkfEGPaa	I agree with Dr. Jeanie|`|DDSEGWFDaa	Put a diaper on him and try again in 6 months.  Repeat until he potty trained or until he goes to college.|`|qKA05EQTaa	Maybee try asking him when you are home. and get some party hats and confetti and have a party when he tells you and does a good job. tell him if he goes to the potty at home as good as he does when he is out you will read him a story or take him for a walk (special just you and him) try to make it fun for him to tell you come up with a code word or signal. maybee that would help.
ldElfsOCaa	I agree that implantation bleeding does not usually last 3 days ...it is usually very brief and many people do not even experience that. It may also be a hormonal imbalance or adjustment of hormones. It is possible to be pregnant however, but consider that you might not be so that you do not let yourself down|`|Zl8UWgnaaa	It's really going to depend on your body.Implantation bleeding normally occurs a week to a few days before your period would normally start. Spotting that occurs around a week after ovulation is likely implantation bleeding; whereas, spotting that occurs very close to the time that your period would normally start may not be. A normal menstrual cycle generally starts off light and then gets heavier.  Your menstrual cycle may be switching up on you, or you may have just had an irregular period. I would just go ahead and do the pregnancy test. If its negative wait a week and do another. If you still feel like you might be request a blood test from your doctor. Good Luck to you and your husband|`|n4LVXFZuaa	no i dont think so|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Implantation bleeding doesn't usually last 3 days. It's usually only spotting for a day. But there is a chance you could still be pregnant.|`|AA10959670	it sound like a implantation bleeding if it was light and last for three days before your period and it was a week early

She will welcome the new baby (it be like a living doll to her) tell your daughter when the babys mom goes to the hospital and dont be too graphic about the explanation....also once the baby is here, you need to keep an eye on your daughter, they love helping, could feed baby food she likes<br>  here are some hints<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/prepare-children" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/baby/guide/prepare-...</a>|`|bjGNV81uaa	I guess one question is, how often is your daughter around? Does she live with you all the time, on the weekends, every other weekend, all summer? How often she will be around the baby will probably affect how involved you want her to be and what you need to do to prepare her. If she lives with you all or most of the time, you may want to try some of these ideas.We found out I was pregnant with my daughter about two weeks before my son turned 2, so I was right there with you. What we did was to include him in as much as we could. For instance, I took him to all of my prenatal appointments, and let him sit on the table with me and listen to the baby's heartbeat. He loved that! We also let him see the ultrasound, although he couldn't quite tell what the heck it was. As the baby got bigger and you could see her kicking and moving I would let him feel and watch. He helped me set up her room (putting the clothes in the dresser, stacking the diapers, wipes, etc). I read him books about being a big brother (go to your library and type "new baby" into the search engine). We picked some of his old baby toys that he was too big for to give to the baby, and he got a couple of big boy toys instead. After she was born, we let him help us whenever he wanted to. He would get her a diaper, give me a wipe, pick out some pajamas for her. He would tell me when he heard her crying and run up to see what was wrong. When she took a nap, I made sure to spend some alone time with him, reading or whatever he wanted to do, at least for an hour or so a day. I praised him for being such a great helper and a good big brother. Now, he is nearly 4 and our daughter is 13 mo, and he adores her. He wakes her up in the morning and they play through the crib slots. He gets her cup out of the fridge for her and gives her pieces of his food. He is very sweet for the most part. The key to the whole thing has been making sure he knows that he is still super special to us. As long as you can do that, you should be good to go. Be careful not to neglect your girl accidentally when you have the baby. Congratulations, and good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: You might not need to tell your daughter about the baby right now, but it's probably not a good idea to wait until your girlfriend is going to the hospital to tell her she's getting a new sibling. Let her prepare herself a little bit. Kids do better when they have a little bit of time to get used to something. Plus that will give her time to ask questions. Don't go into too many details, though. A simple statement, like, "Sarah (or whatever) has a baby growing in her tummy, and when the baby is big enough, she/he will come out and will come here and live with us. Won't that be exciting?" Then respond according to her reaction.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Be prepared for a lot of terrible twos moments. Especially with already another change of you moving in together then about the time she adjusts to that her life is once more upset my another addition. Be patient...make one on one time with her. After the baby is here, let her hold the baby and tell her what a big helper she is. Let her run for a diaper for the baby or other small tasks to make her feel important to. It's very important that those first days you don't forget or exclude her. The more she feels needed loved and wanted the less she'll react negatively.

qXq0nmBzaa	There is less reliance these days on monograms which means initials are less important too.    The key is to avoid names that lead to really skanky initials like the ones found in Adrienne Suzanne Smith, Peter Isaac Greene, etc.  I think if really nasty combinations are avoided, nothing else matters.

It would only bother me if it spelled out something very unflattering or obscene.    BAM is fine to me; it sounds cute and masculine, so even if people teased him by saying "Baammm!!!" or "Bam-Bam" that really isn't too soul-destroying.

My son went through this faze too and I did have to take away privileges till he got better..but I stuck to my gins and he did finally take and interest..I also took him to the store and let him pick out new toothbrush, hair brush, deodorant and cologne..And i do believe that helped some..Good Luck and stick to your guns.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	just keep on her shirt tails for awhile...follow her around in her routines until she does what she should without arguement|`|7WcfzvPvaa	You are right that this is just a stage, but it is a stage that deals with control.  It is a power struggle.  Your daughter has realized that the one thing you can't control about her is her body.  Instead of making it a power struggle, you need to talk with her.  Instead of telling her that her teeth are going to rot, talk to her about bad breath.  Explain that if she stinks, no kids are going to like her, that they will make fun of her behind her back.  Tell her that you love her and don't want the kids making fun of her because she doesn't look good.  Also, explain what effect it has on you.  Tell her that if she goes to school with her hair a mess and stinking, that the teachers aren't going to say "oh she didn't brush her hair" they are going to say "her mom didn't make her brush her hair".  This is what has worked for me.  I found that even though there is a power struggle, my kids love me and don't want anyone talking bad about me!  Good Luck|`|AA11920812	What other discipline is there if you aren`t punishing? Isn`t that the meaning of discipline?<br>  <br>  I`d just tell her for everything she doesn`t do at bed time you are deducting 30 minutes of tv time (per offense). If her teeth aren`t brushed she looses 30 minutes. If her clothes aren`t laid out she looses another 30 minutes. <br>  <br>  Or, take away something else she enjoys. If there are no consequences for her bad behaviour she won`t see any need to do differently. Its your job to make those consequences the kid that she won`t like.|`|d7kGopYxaa	Well when i was ten i had the same problem. My mom showed me pictures of how teeth look underbrushed, and how hair will tangled s bad you have to cut all your hair off. Not to mention how the teasing is going to be worse for the years to come if she doesn't take a bath or shower. I recommend getting her some yummy smelling body wash and yummy smelling hair wash. It scared me so much that I wash my face with acne face wash twice a day.<br>  <br>  Let her choose the body wash and hair wash and deodorant. She will appreciate it much more.|`|irLnPW4aaa	We had the same issue with my daughter about a year ago or so.  What worked was a checklist.  All the things she needed to do were on the list, and she had to check them off as she did them.  And I kept an eye out to make sure she really did them.  When a certain number of days went by with everything done, she got to choose a small reward (usually watch a movie, pick dinner, etc).<br>  <br>  She's 12 now and STILL needs to be reminded, but she knows that if she is a problem, we'll go back to the checklist.

1pggu5aSaa	Honey, I am 16 and I feel the exact same way! Everywhere I go I look at cute lil babies and want one! After thinking about the responsibilities that you would have for a baby, then I say that I will wait. Just think, after having a baby you will have to always be with the child, forever. You cant just take it away. You have to change the diapers all the time, feed it, take it baths, hear the crying. Its good if its temporary, right! Lol.. But I do feel you..its probably our hormones. But I honestly cannot wait until I do have a baby! Just wait until you are happily married!|`|dPULl5hjaa	Because you see most teens having babies.<br>  <br>  Wait for 10 years - live your life without the responsibility of a child.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	Because humans reach reproductive maturity earlier than is currently considered socially acceptable to have children.<br>  <br>  Its normal to want to have a baby, and that feeling probably will go away in a few years and not come back for awhile.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	You sound like you have a strong maternal instinct, but if you really have a sincere love for a baby you will realize that you are far to young to provide much of a life for this child. It also sounds like you have a lot of love to give and want to give it to a child. Or possibly you want someone to love YOU unconditionally. These are common reasons teenagers get pregnant on purpose. The dream always fades very quickly.<br>  <br>  Get an education, a solid career and a stable relationship.

To be a parent / mother is to have knowledge to pass on to your kids, and 16 is way to inexperienced in dealing with kids . if you watch how a teen deals with things like patience , reactions, conflicts. etc. it is new to them compared to someone in their late 20s and 30s. thats because life is all about experience and growing from your mistakes and mishaps. you havent had enough to show yr children that . its okay too you shouldnt you are 16. I understand the feeling, thats because you love him. BUT that doesnt mean to have kids. as soon as that happens, youll feel needy and he wont want that and then hell be gone and youll be left with a baby.   you cant expect just because you and yr bf are together now , in 3 mths you may not.

You can get pregnant once a month and it only takes about two weeks from the time u have sex to the time the baby is fully implanted for u to be pregnant.  At this point u could take a Home pregnancy test.  If thats not positive and u still want to make sure go to the doctor for a blood test.

AZ6Z0pXJaa	Only YOU can make that decision.    Forget about all the people on here telling YOU what to - half of them are MEN who are NEVER going to go through the physical, hormonal & emotional changes that a pregnancy brings anyway - which is not to discount their opinion, it's a bit like us females having menstrual cramps or a male having a '*****'.....    1. Do they have counselling services at public hospitals or women's health centres where you can obtain some 'active listening' ears?    Here are few questions I would be asking?    (I feel this is the most important question):   (A) Do I have family support - eg a mother, sister, aunty, grandma, etc to assist me with parenting, childcare, etc?    (B) Do I have enough education to support my child & obtain a job?    (C) Do I WANT to be in a relationship with the father -or is he perhaps not 'the one'?  (D) Can I afford to exist on welfare - if I need to?    (E) Am I EMOTIONALLY ready to nuture, care for & be responsible for a child for the next 18 to 21 years WITHOUT making that child feel bad for what essentially is 'my mistake'?    (F) Could I consider other avenues - eg adoption?    (G) Would I feel guilty if I did adopt or abort - eg - having nightmares, depression, constantly wondering what it would have looked like?    (H) Can I resume my education, get a good career going & financially be responsible for this child should I choose to not abort?    Please get some counselling & do some research-remember - IT'S YOUR BODY & YOUR LIFE HERE & essentially, someone else's life.|`|q89VjD62aa	I am pro choice and it really upsets me when people say that your a monster or a murder if you get an abortion this is my views I'm not saying ur wrong and I'm right this is just how I feel. Hear me out on this cause today in one of my classes this subject came up and just about everyone was pro life they said it was wrong and that women who get them should go to jail and they will go to hell. First of all its already bad enough to go thru an with an abortion without people calling you a horrible person. Also you already feel horrible to begin with. Your haunted by the memories. It is one of the worst possible things to go thru for any women. So I do not think this is a subject that should be talked about. Its between a women and her doctor that's is. Also yes if ur able to have sex you should be ready to have kids is what a lot of people say. But to be honest even with safe sex their is still a chance. My mum had me young and for that she suffered and so did I. Money was a huge issue. I would never have my child when I knew I would not be able to give it what it needs and then some. I would not want my child to have to start working at a very young age. I would never bring a child up in a manner that I was. Everyone has their own views. And this is mine. I'm sorry its not what every wants to hear but this is just how I feel. I respect everyones views. But I don't not think this subject should be preached about. Hunny this is you're choice and NO ONE should tell you what you should do. YOU are NO murder if you do. I'm not trying to mean to all you pro life people out there I'm pro choice. And like I said I really do believe this is not a subject that should be talked about like this. You do what you feel is right hunny if you don't think you are ready to be a mom than don't because no child deserves a hard life.|`|6zkKEeGCaa	iF Having a baby isn't right for you.. it is definately right for someone else out there.. try adoption.. im sure a couple out there who isn't as lucky conceiving would love to become parents.. and would be able to give the baby a good life.. there's many stable couples out there who are ready to take on the responsibilities and gift of being parents.. consider adoption most def. all in all it is you and the fathers decision.. only you know what and how this would affect you.. good luck on whatever you chose. *by the way how many wks are you?|`|wiAVa1H5aa	It's not selfish, it's pragmatic - but you need to decide this yourself and follow what your heart is telling you.|`|0Sv8PiH9aa	Give it up for adoption but please don't kill your baby because you don't want to lose your youth.

You knew the consequence of having sex. There is always the option of adoption.|`|ghTcbRxJaa	Well, let me explain this...  If you do it, in sometime of your life u will be regreting..  And hey, that baby want to be alive, and you are the mother no matter what.  you make a mistake, because you had to think it before all.  But now you have to be responsable with that litle child.  Dont kill him!   It is better to give him in adoption if you dont want to have it.  but he deserves life and if you abort him you are making a very great mistake...and for God is not right. Is a sin! think in that ok  Bye God Bless You!|`|Jn1ZfBxlaa	No, abortion isn't right for you, or anyone for that matter and yes it's selfish of you to want one. Don't be lazy, you're a grown woman, get a job, work for your baby. If you just don't think you can, look into adoption. Abortion is a woman's choice, but you know who doesn't have a choice? The dead baby.|`|7i77VmNKaa	Whether or not you decide to raise the child is irrelevant because abortion is not the answer. There are other alternatives such as planned adoption. Many prospective infertile couples will also help with all the expenses involved.  If you're even questioning  at this point whether or not you're being selfish by terminating the pregnancy, can you imagine how you'll feel for the rest of your life if you kill the baby? It's a decision you'll live with forever, and one you'll never forget.
qHAgbuHkaa	Cervical incompetence I think usually starts occurring around the 12th week or so. Sitting for extended periods of time shouldn't hurt your cervix, however, with multiples or when feeling pressure down there, it should always be mentioned to your doctor. If you're feeling pressure that seems like it might be abnormal, you should call your doctor on Mon and let her/him know and they will probably have you come in to check your cervix just to be sure. If your cervix is shortening or thinning out, they will do something about it.|`|fcfd19147db60f65269e3a714d3a6e21aa	cervical incompetence can be diagnosed any time, though it is usually caught early in the pregnancy. Even though your next apt is not until March, call your doctors office and speak to him or her. If they are not available, speak to the ob nurse. Someone will be able to give you an answer.

iMULlxdgaa	My best friend had this done and her baby was fine.  Full term , actually it was her first and it was overdue!  but everything went smooothly!|`|se3RwEWyaa	It is fairly simple procedure that can be done laproscopically. I was not pregnant, but I had mine removed. It leave about an inch of a scar and the procedure is minute. I will pray that everything goes ok. You and your baby will be absolutely fine!!! To a fast recovery!!! Keep me posted! God bless! X
ZrIl3PwLaa	your ip address is like your computers social no you can not change or erase it unless you buy a new computer.    If you are so worried why are you looking at porn???    good luck!!!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	IP=Internet protocol. It's like your PC's individual signature. When you go onto a site and do things,it saves your IP address.   Unless someone is a really good hacker,they won't be able to find out who you are with your IP without a supena,and that means they have spoken to law enforcement and have a good reason to,such as you've done something illegal on their site.       There are ways to hide it,but I have no idea how to do that,but it requires a Proxy server..|`|mtmMQH4Xaa	it's not just porn where your IP address is saved.  Everyplace you visit on the internet your IP address is logged on a file at that site.  The company that supply's your internet service has a log file of where you've been.  You have no way of deleting that information.  By deleting your computer history you only stop people that share the same computer from seeing where you have been, although someone that knows their way around a computer will still find traces of where you've been but most don't know where to look.    I'd say delete your history & cookies and don't worry about it.  Then stay away from the porn|`|1frcThISaa	    when you go to this website it automatically tells you what your IP address is, awesome huh? lol    idk id just delete the browsing history|`|r0ISrLc1aa	yeah its on your computer, its not gonna change unless you buy a new computer.    no ones gonna come after you..don't worry. no one knows if the person using the computer is over 18.    don't stresssss.|`|tMl7GjqTaa	internet provider, so whoever has it can get your address|`|op4gBJRJaa	Wrong to all the answers that say buy a new computer.  Your i.p address all depends on the network your connected to it always changes every time you change network.    Don't worry if the pornography sites have your i.p address, porn is completely legal you cant get into trouble for looking at it (Only with your parents).    Even if they do have it don't worry about it, because guess what over a billion people go on pornography sites you really think they'll just pick on you?|`|Lq3rKoNGaa	How bout you don't watch it?    Sweetie, you can get in some serious trouble for watching stuff like that.    You are a kid. Enjoy being young.|`|rj5FE3Klaa	Unless the person who accesses your computer is a computer tech or knows what to do, no one will be able to find any of your deleted history and whatnot. Your IP address is only logged but those companies are discrete about their business and don't give that information out usually.   IP addresses are only logged at most websites so that the website can do things like save settings for your specific computer.|`|yj5qC8Gbaa	If you want clear your computer:  for IE : tools --> clear browsing history --> delete all(it enough delete  history, cookies, temporary files)  for firefox : tools --> clear private data    For future use chrome in incognito mode :-)  and don't care about ip(it's only address of your computer in network.Only provider know were you was,but it confidential information)|`|H5i8BMh2aa	Your IP address is basically your computer's identifying trace code.  Say you tried to make multiple yahoo accounts from the same computer so you could ask more questions on yahoo answers. There would be a possibility that yahoo would know you were doing this, because all the accounts would be signed up using the same IP address. Basically they would just know several accounts were made with the same computer.  Does that make sense? I hope so...    Porn gives your computer viruses, be careful.    If you download the newest version of internet explorer, you can use this weird "in private browsing" thing, where it doesn't save history, or cookies, or anything.   Try that.  :)|`|C2L3gaYZaa	there is a simply technique just use software named ultrasurf(http://imtarun.blogspot.com/2008/10/how-... so that outside world person can not guess who you are and delete you complete browser history, your cookie, catch after you  have done all of that no one catch you.  Enjoy the porn (use http://searchpornvideo.blogspot.com for free porn movies)
0iuvUhMpaa	Hey there,   im 30 week and at about 28 weeks i had the same thing and i was worried,i have had a fine pregnancy except that he measures 2 weeks behind.  I was told that is was just my muscles moving and stretching pre paring for the "big day" It was horrible but i was told not to worry about it.  I thought it was really strange though becuase it felt like it was behind my bones.  Good luck love it should just be your body pre paring but go to the doc if you are worried :)|`|cn91FeWcaa	talk to your doctor because i just read that dull back pain could be a sign of preterm labor|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	could be sciatica during pregnancy:    As your baby grows, your uterus may press on the sciatic nerve, which connects your legs to your spinal cord. Sciatica (sciatic nerve pain) is a sharp or aching pain that usually starts in the lower back or buttock and sometimes seems to shoot down the back of the leg to the calf or heel.    Most women who experience sciatica notice it first while on their feet. You can try to rest as much as possible to ease the pain. A heating pad or hot water bottle (wrapped in a towel to avoid burns) applied to the area is another solution. There are many exercises to help with this nagging problem. Sometimes simple stretching exercises done twice each day can give great relief.    Acetaminophen (Tylenol?) can be an alternative if nothing else seems to be helping. You may want to discuss the use of non-steroidal medications such as ibuprofen (Motrin?, Advil?) with your practitioner to see if they are an option for you. Many physicians believe these medications to be safe until the 32nd week of pregnancy. If the problem gets so severe that you are having trouble walking, or it is interfering with your life, discuss treatment options with your practitioner.    Even if sciatica starts fairly early in your pregnancy, you may not be destined to have pain for all the remaining months. Many women grow out of this problem later in the pregnancy
0iuvUhMpaa	Hey,   i havent had the problem personally but apparently even though your cervix is high you can still give birth when ever the baby is ready. Some one i know gave birth and 10 mins before that the midwife couldnt reach her cervix so there isnt really anything to worry about,  good luck love :)

Choose something that will last his whole life.|`|xqPRS6Buaa	Definitely not.|`|Ipyapngdaa	A son? No, sounds like baby (if thats how you were going to pronounce it). Not a good name for a boy.

UUpsa35Daa	Depends...     If your under 13...you're told off, insulted and reported for being on here underage.      If you're under 18...you're could possibly be written off by the "adults" as not knowing anything important or worthwhile. (But with this, if you don't state your age and they found out your age in any other way (like if you put it in a past question or answer), some people will accuse you of lying or talking about things you're only pretending to know about.)    And just in general, there's the chance of young (or anybody really) people picking up stalkers. But of course, the first 2 aren't really that dangerous...just things that might happen if you tell people your age.|`|mEKsbCw2aa	Didnt think there was any. Im 20!|`|qRElKKjXaa	I don't think there is one, really, unless you are super young. If you're over 16 I think it's fine. I'm always honest about my age.|`|j2mRop0laa	Idk. I have only told maybe 2 people my first name and age on here, in email. I just don't like for a lot of people to have info on me. If I do tell, it's because I can pretty much guarantee they aren't crazy stalkers. lol|`|cAtWxJG1aa	if you're not yet an adult, you set yourself up to be stalked by pedophiles.
zj91sSsuaa	You have to love Roe v Wade and how people misinterpret its decision.  The winning argument was that, for her to carry the baby to full term would cause her mental distress, therefore she should be granted an abortion without the Governments consent or acknowledgement, meaning they didnt have the right to ask her why she was getting one, only that her and the doctor felt it would be a good decision for her state of mind.    It was a medical decision and the government has no right to ask you about it.  For those of you that still dont GET IT.  Lets say you wish for a tubular litigation (tubes tied).  Do you think the Government should know about it?  How about a vasectomy?  Do you think you should let the government know you are getting one?  Its none of their business.  But see heres the tricky part that no one got.  You are not dealing with one life, you can argue when life truly begins all you want, but the fact is it will be a child; its already on its way to become human, therefore it does have rights.  Now theres more to this, but I dont want to get into it, just take our word for it, it is a human being with rights.  So now that you understand that another life is involved, you have to weigh your options.  Is carrying a baby to full term, going to cause you physical or psychological health problems?  None of the women going to the abortion clinics today get a psychological evaluation to determine that.  NONE.  Well our Government (god bless them) seen this is going to be a problem.  So they decided that under these conditions; rape, incest and medical complications were acceptable to have an abortion.   It was the governments understanding that people would consult their doctors before having an abortion, and if he/she (Dr.) was true to his/her word to Do no harm then the court of the people wouldnt have a problem with it.  But No, you all had to manipulate the decision and the ONLY Dr. you consult is the one giving you the abortion.  Now I would rewrite the law to be fair; I think all women should see two Doctors, a psychologist, because a medical doctor would be ill qualified to determine if it would cause her psychological trauma.   And of course, your medical Doctor to see if any physical problems may occur.     Now you all think Im some goody two shoes republican religious nut, well Im not.  I want them to have abortions, for my own selfish reasons.  Hey if anyone disagrees feel free to email me|`|iMULlxdgaa	I think some people don't like adoption because they know that the adoption system cna suck for the child. REally sometimes it might be financial problems and that makes sense.  I mean here in the states I'm sure you've heard...there is a lady that just had octuplets...but her family is bankrupt.  People are all kinds of mad over this and think the children will be put in foster care soon.  I don't know but everyone has reasons for wehat their choice is and I don't judge anyone ...as long as they are being responsible .  I personally rather a kid at 15 or whatever opt for the abortion (or adoption) rahter than watch them leave a baby in a dumpster or in a car...  Everyone needs to just take reponsabilty for what is happening in their lives.|`|xOr67VDiaa	It's not up to anyone but the mother. even a human that has no morals can make such a serious decision, we should stop worrying about who does what and stop the ppl who cant even think b4 they act.|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	I've had an ectopic. I aborted the fetus.  You have to remember that the mother has to carry the pregnancy and give birth.|`|AA11615848	Abortion should be allowed. It is taking a life, but a life not yet born. Without Abortions some families would have suffering and problems where, if the child was born, the child would suffer their whole life due to the fued of his or her family.|`|MbmHripJaa	well it is a good idea but then shouldn't people wanting to keep the baby go infront of a judge and state why and show they have the money to take care of one? I think it is a good idea but there are a lot of people having babies that shouldn't be. Also I think a father should be more involved in a decision-- but some women dont include them because in a lot of cases fathers are the ones who want the abortion.. Not ALL cases but a lot of them.|`|tp61e25Eaa	I was adopted and I have adopted siblings. I have a younger brother who has learning difficulties because his mother drank when he was in the womb. I have a sister with health problems because of where she came from. I was a unwanted child to a violent, unstable mother. Even with all of these things, we are glad to be here and are blessed to have been adopted. If our mothers chose to end our lives we would have never been. I am often torn because of the issue of drug/alcohol abuse with pregnant mothers and abortion. On one hand you have a lifetime of struggle for someone who is damaged by drugs/alcohol, on the other hand you have the ability to terminate that life. To terminate. To kill. People justify it because they say, "When does life begin anyway?", or "They would never know any different not being here...". Abortion will always be a tough issue because in the end, there is a newly created life being terminated; but there will always be irresponsible people getting pregnant and living off of the system, creating unwanted lives, with little hope unless they get adopted or are lucky enough to have a stable home life. Every case is different but the same.|`|A6WHbfMyaa	yes i thinkit's a good idea but it will never happen.. the government doesn't care enough to go through all the work that it would take to have some sort of law passed like that... it's just really sad the way humanity has become..the end times are coming|`|uv7cHs22aa	i dont think abortion should be considered under ANY circumstances.|`|sngEejAVaa	I agree with you!! As a 30 yr old mother of 2 children, I got pregnant at the age of 18, and would have never thought about abortion.. I believe that saying.. "you made your bed, now lie in it."  The abortion rate is getting to drastic, I have a family member who has has 2 abortions and I despize it... What more can we do here... There is free birth control offered out there..    Now on the adoption matter, the rules and regulations are way to steep now a days to even be considered, unless you have millions or are at least prettty wealthy.. I believe you dont need to be rich nor wealthy to love and provide for a child.    Now another note... I am tired of these people having babies after babies and collecting welfare because they dont want to work.. Now a days it takes both parents to work very hard to support a family.|`|Om1yADWRaa	All I Can say is if any of you have been pregnant and thought of giving a baby up for adoption you will know its not an alternative to  having an abortion I thought of that myself don't get me wrong I'm no angel but I don't like abortion myself, but I agree with a lot of people its sometimes necessary to have one If i was raped at a young age i wouldn't be able to raise a baby on my own and giving a baby up for adoption you have carried for 9 months nurtured in your womb given birth to and then just have it taken away is torture. i was 16 when i fell pregnant with my son and me and my partner decided we could keep our son as we loved each other very much and had financial means but you can't always say you wouldn't do something because of how you feel now. the only way to determine that you won't have to have an abortion is to have sex only to have a baby as my son was conceived due to condom failure.|`|d678f8b7d26c1604273a818860d37290aa	Abortion is out of control!     let me start out by I am 100% against abortion!     Why should a child be punished by death???     I dont care what medical people say they find during test and ultra sound. There is a heart beat!!! you have a baby they could be wrong!     Life or death after 20 weeks oh come on!!! at 20 weeks to get the baby out is delivery!!! why kill it when its all most out! Murder     They need to be more strict on laws when it comes to abortion!    They should have to give full information and they system should track that stuff. Limit them    The mother and father has to be there for all the appointments and sign legal papers to killing of there child.     No father sign no abortion     Dna test can be done!     they should see an ultra sound     abortion should be going in to labor and deliver the baby no matter how far you are a couple of weeks you going to have the pains no dnc     after the abortion they have to fill out a birth certificate and death certificate.     they have to hold the baby or if its too tiny to see look at it through a Lens.     pay full cost for delivery and funeral arrangements     Counseling for both before and after 1 every 3mos after    limit how many a women can have    RAPE it happens but a baby should not die! If a women say she was rape she should have to take a lie detector test about it. an investigation should be made, dna taken from the baby and all powers to go towards finding the man who did it and for him to be behind bars for rape and murder     OUR SYSTEM HAS FAILED     we need to teach safe sex!   Give kids condoms  and so much more!!!!     HER BODY HER RIGHT?? NO NO NO     What about the babies right??? Your killing a baby who is trying to grow.     any one who has an abortion is still a mother and father to a baby that was killed that they help kill!     There is no difference in walking in to a store pulling a gun and killing someone.     Murder is murder! no matter how you look at it    poor little babies|`|VXvEN6dvaa	I think to prevent matters like this then the sex should be protected then the father has a say in whether the baby is born or not and so does the mother....problem solved. I just feel if fathers didn't want a baby or mothers didn't want to have an abortion then they should have worn protection in the first place. And the courts really should have no say on what's best for the woman to do with her body. If she doesn't want to have the baby then well, that's on her. The guy objecting to that: I feel that if he objected to wearing protection then he should shut up and handle his business.|`|AA10626373	Actually, I MUCH prefer folks having all the sex they want so long as they also use condoms, chemical birth control, or any other birth control.  Abortion though is fine. I have no ethical or moral objections to it at all.  It's not a "Baby", it's a small collection of cells.  The DNA may be "human", but the cells arent' a person.   Anymore than your flaking skin cells that given the right cloning lab work also have the "potential" to be human are a person.  I always have considered the argument that it's fertilized so it's a person, the dumbest one out there.  The same folks who spout that would sue you if you sat them in a restaurant and served them a fertilized chicken egg and charged them for a fried chicken dinner.  Heck, it's fertilized and has the DNA and the potential to be a chicken, so why not??    Your other point, though, is one that's being ignored by most and I'd take it even further.  Women continually insist that it's their body and they have the right to make the decision.  Fine.  I can go with that.  HOWEVER, they also often moan that since they are pregnant that the guy now pays for almost everything for the next 18 years.  Well, if you're a mature, capable individual who can make a decision, why not this - for the first three months of the pregnancy (starting from the day you notify the father) the man also has a say. If he doesn't want to bear the burden of an accidental pregnancy, the child can be aborted (with the female's consent.) However, if the woman chooses to bear the child to term, after all it's her body, that she signs a statement that she is a "mature capable adult" and as such SHE as a result of her thoughtful choice will also bear the cost of raising this unwanted (by the male) child.    You can't claim to be fully capable of making YOUR own decisions and then start whining afterward that it's the "woe is me" bit. However, the state will never let this go through because they don't want to get stuck paying for your kid, so as someone above said = "guy is SCREWED"|`|oacVerFxaa	hey if ur thinking of having an abortion, well dont. Having a baby is a beautiful thing. That baby would want to be born more then anything else. Just give it life then put him up for adoption. That is what i would do.
5DK546BUaa	Girl   Amanda Belle *  - TU : I was unsure how I would rate this at first, since Amanda was one of those trendy/popular names and Belle is currently a trendy/popular name... However, this is a pretty name, classic and simple (I was surprised to find that it has been on the SSA list since 1880 and been in the top 500 the whole time)... I think that this would be a good name, it ages nicely, and has a sweet meaning...    Girl  Amanda Chloe * - TD : I really dislike Chloe... it simply sounds harsh and I dislike the spelling-to-pronunciation... This rating came down to a personal preference...    Girl  Amanda Jane * - TU : I love the fact that both the Amanda and Jane could be used to honor loved ones (Jane is a feminine version of John, and Jack is a diminutive of John)... Also, this name flows better then Amanda Belle with your last name (the hard "JAYN" seems to work better with a hard middle sound then the softer "BEL" - IMO)    Girl  Anna Belle * - TD : Sorry, this name (whether contracted or separate) always reminds me of a cow... I think it is something passed on to me from my mother, who grew up spending a lot of time on family farms...    Girl  Clara Elizabeth * - TU : Really, what is there to critique here... Both names are beautiful, classic, and extremely pretty... plus neither name is likely to go out of style!    Girl  Daisy Angelina * TU : I think that I would almost prefer Daisy Elizabeth Salkatin... I'm not a big fan of Angelina, but I have nothing bad to say about it either... I love Daisy, it is sweet, simple, and very feminine!    Girl  Lily Belle * - TU : I like the Lily more then the Belle... What about Lily Anna or Lily Jane? *shrugs* I guess my biggest gripe about Belle is that it is becoming filler (but names become filler because they work well in that position - arg, I'm still not 100% sure on where I stand on filler names!)    Girl  Lily Miranda * - TU : I like the different middle name! I think that this is a very sweet and beautiful, feminine name :)    Girl  Lisette Arabella * - TU : I love Lisette! It is a version of your name (Elizabeth), and similar to Lisa and numerous names that end with "ette" as to make it seem familiar, even though it has never been very popular (another mark in favor of this name!)... Arabella is sweet, and a fuller version of the common Belle names... I would have to say that this just might be my favorite girls name from your list!    Girl  Madelina Rose * - TU : While I gave this a good rating, I am not overly fond of the Madelina... It is a sweet enough version of Madeline, but seems a bit much IMO... Rose is a classic, simply sweet, feminine name that I love...    Girl  Violet Angelina * - TU : Since you already know my opinion of Angelina, I'm not going to bother repeating myself... I love the name Violet... it is sweet, feminine, and just such a beautiful name (I can picture Violet on a cute little girl with brown pigtails and I can picture the same little girl sitting on Grandma Violet's lap)...    Girl  Violet Arabella * - TU : Well, of course this is a thumbs up! This is another of my favorites from your girls list (which I like better is a toss up!)      Boy  Arthur Wilfred * - TU : I love that you are thinking of using Arthur! It is a classic, masculine name that deserves to be used! When paired with Wilfred, it reminds me of a character from a fairytale... I am not 100% sure on where I stand on the Wilfred, but my feeling is if you like it, then you should feel good about using it!    Boy  Arthur Wulfric * - TU : I think that the combo here sounds almost barbaric... I expect to see Vikings when I see this name... However, (IMO) that makes it a good name... the name has character and personality!    Boy  Jack Andrew * - TU : Overall, this is just a "mew" name for me... neither of the names do anything for me, but I have no complaints about either also. I do, however, love the fact that you have meaning attached to each name (that raises my opinion of a name considerably!)        So, when do you think you might have to start to worry about what names to use? And how many names do you think you might end up needing?|`|MxMonsbVaa	madelina is stunning|`|KNxs4PrZaa	Clara Rose
uttbqGB9aa	This could depend on many factors...not just pregnancy.    Your cycle can be irregular and it is trying to re regulate itself.    A female is blessed with a self cleaning vagina 5000! So it will cleanse anything that it feels should be rejected from its path.    As for the bloating, you could just be really late from stress, diet, or other common factors and your blood walls have been filling up waiting for the egg to stick.    The discharge you said white mucus....does it smell foul? are you itchy? Has this discharge been constant? If so..then you really need to get to the doc, you could have some kind of vaginal infection.    All in all you should go to your gyn or regular doc and tell your symptoms. Its always better to be safe than sorry right?    Hope you feel better :) Good luck :)|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	Take a pregnancy test!|`|6avKnzkoaa	It could mean that your period is coming. Bloating, discharge and cramping can be normal PMS symptoms. However, I would do a pregnancy test when your period is due to arrive just to check.

xi7mq1xGaa	Ok, you can trust my answer, because I am a Nursery teacher (Actual teacher, at a state school, not a childcare worker in a private Nursery). He can definitely, 100%, start Nursery this September. Next September (2010), he will be starting in the Reception class of a school. Some Nursery classes accept children the term or half term after their 3rd birthday, so depending on when you're moving back to the UK and if the class has a space, he may be able to start Nursery sooner than September.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	How odd, the only answer that makes any sense on here is from "mommy-to-be" and everybody has "thumbs downed" her. He can start nursery at any age, my little sister started at 7 months.    To get into preschool he will have to be 2 or 3 (depending on the school.)|`|4uB0bbhnaa	In Scotland he should get a part time nursery place as he is 3    may be different in other parts of the UK    Edit- Why do people outside the UK, answer this question,for the UK,with answers that are  clearly irrelevant.|`|mPTBU0QDaa	If he's 3, he should be able to enter most preschools. Preschools will not take a child under the age of 3, but most will take a 3-year-old. Is he potty trained? Sometimes a preschool will not take a child who is not potty trained, whether he wears diapers to school or not.     Now, if you send him to a preschool/childcare, then the rules are different. But if you send him to an actual preschool, he should be able to start with no problem if he is 3 and potty trained.|`|lXcH7ekkaa	This september|`|o68Zageuaa	If when you move back the nursery has a place for him he should be able to start right away, nursery's are not like school and kids don't have to wait till september intake to start, My daughter was 3 on oct 1st and started nursery that day,   Hope this helps and that once your settled back in the UK he gets settled into a nursery :)|`|GCcQPzD6aa	I'm from Wales and I know here they start nursery 3times a year. In the September, in January (i think) and then again in April. It works so that the children are entitled to a free nursery place once there 3, if they were born between April and august they would start in September, then if born between September and December they would start in January and between January and march start in April. I don't think all schools run this scheme though only certain ones. But that if for government run nursery, If you want to send your child to a private nursery I think most start at around 4months onwards. hope that makes sense to you|`|CJj5g3DMaa	4 years|`|osplv9ssaa	4..|`|iHkbrJF1aa	He will get the free nursery vouchers this September as he will be 3 then during the new term.|`|e8W9Q9cbaa	Definitely this september, for a pre-school nursery- though its not compulsory.     They are actually entitled to either a free pre-school place, or if all local ones are full then a pre-school room in a private nursery which they will get government vouchers for for 16 hours a week I think it is.     If you know where you are moving, and want him to go to a nursery attatched to a primary school then get his name down on a list asap!

ZMn3gbccaa	Discipline them by telling them no and meaning it send them to the corner, no play time, spankings, depends on the age, take away privileges but when they are normal or respectful go out of your way to do things with them to show them you have a loving side too|`|da497b496d860db69805aee850404dcdaa	Depends on how old they are.|`|tgUbWojPaa	By sending them to time out and not taking no for an answer. Take away things they like. Don't mean to be rude but, they are like this from lack of parenting skills.|`|LGidAYDwaa	First, you have to take charge. They are not allowed to argue with you. Give them time outs in separate corners when they get in trouble and use a timer - set it for 7 minutes. Ignore them completely but make sure they stay in the chairs. If they get up from the chair, don't speak. Just walk over, pick them up and put them back in the chair. Don't even make eye contact.  Every time one of them tries to argue with you, set the timer back at 7 minutes again. Continue until they are finally quiet for 7 minutes straight.  And another good tip: never make a threat if you aren't going to follow through. Kids really love to take advantage of that one.    That's only the beginning. Here are some tips for parents:   http://giftedkids.about.com/od/familylif...

D6wwOv03aa	20 weeks Pregnant with my third my oldest just turned five and my youngest almost two . . AND POTTY TRAINING!! Life becomes more colorful with family and I am so thankful and cannot imagine life without these beautiful entertainers! It's harder for me this pregnancy because I have been exhausted, so sleep and definitely bigger than in my last two at this stage . . .   Take deep breaths!     Remember to eat small snacks that are good for you and the baby, kids are only little for so long and won't let us love them the same as teens so take the time out to read to them and love them often . . then put them to bed and study!!!   Best wishes and good luck! Hope it goes well and STAY SAFE!|`|oIFMohfUaa	Nice...you ask for pleasant you get smart aleck answers!    I don't have a lot of tips...mine were also close together.  Mostly get a lot of rest (when possible) so that you don't get sick. Take mulit vitamin.     Try to have a schedule...at least at bedtime to give you a few moments peace...or time to study!      Pack stuff at night so it's not too stressful in the morning.  Also, if there is a delay, there is no running around looking for things you forgot!    It is so hectic for awhile, but later it's so nice to have had them together!    Good luck!|`|2isbOuRhaa	my daughter is 3 yrs old. my son is 1 yr old. and im 19 weeks pregnant. so im in the same position as you. i cant really give you advice on how to deal with it because the baby isnt here yet, but im curious to what other's are going to say...    good luck and congrats!|`|d96d60a18dbc51f4283545a184f1c7eeaa	Abortion. 22....in school....2 kids....not white?

Being pregnant with 2 kids is no joke but you will get through it. :)  You survived your first semester which was my biggest battle.  I will say though that adjust to life with 3 was much easier for me than adjusting to life with 2 after just having 1.   My only advice is to just take it day by day.
hGNvbC6oaa	Man, you got terrible answers!  I can't believe no one understood what you were saying!!  I'd say, if you were careful and slow about dismantelling it, then the bfp is actually correct!  Nothing but HCG would cause you to get a positive result.  But, if you really want to know, I'd get another just to be positive and don't dismantel it this time, lol I know how interesting it can be though!  HAHA  OR buy 2 and pee on both and dismantel 1 and not the other.  See what both results say.|`|xEXb96UKaa	haha, i thought i was the only one who dismantled their pregnancy test. well mine was positive and i have the little guy the test indicated sitting on my lap as i'm writing this. i never heard that taking it apart can affect the result, it didn't affect my test strip. but you can always get another one nd test again just to put your mind at ease,|`|pcjLTnwTaa	cant u take a photo of it without taking it a part? and cant u see it without taking it a part too?

wi4XXfCEaa	Lets see...my favorite boys name from your list is James and then next is Michael and then Harris (although I prefer Harrison). So, my favorite boy name is definitely Michael James, but I think it is better James Michael.    For the girls, I like the names Renae (but spelled Renee), Joyce, Christina (but prefer Kristine), Paige, Madeleine (and Madeline), Claire, Isabelle (and Isabel), Emmaleigh (but spelled Emily), Amelia, Charlotte, and Kathryn (but spelled Catherine). So, overall you have some really great girls names!!    I LOVE Joyce as a middle name, it is my favorite! I also love Paige and Claire as middle names as well (they are pretty as first too though). I like Catherine the best, but it is pretty spelled Kathryn as well. I also love love love Charlotte, Amelia, and Emily (Emmaleigh). So, my favorite girls names in order are..  Charlotte Kathryn  Claire Isabelle  Paige Madeleine  Emmaleigh Joy  Ashlynne Joyce  Caitlyn Amelia  Amara Renae  Christina Leigh  Natalie Elaine  Jamie Liana  Jennaleigh Faith  Rachel Joy  Alexandria Dianne  Leigha Marris  Kelly Jade    Some Great Names!!|`|hTieELhTaa	ummm there is no list just asking for member login sorry|`|GMabcQXwaa	There is no name list.

It reminds me of a teenager girl, but I can't seem to imagine to girl growing any more.    Jenny Faith doesn't seem to flow evenly for me.    Charlie Carl, Carl is....a little bit objected to a tubby kid in my mind. Charlie is alright.    Charlie Peter is okay.    John Benjamin is the absolute cutest of all the boy names!

vmWEm4Jzaa	keep curtis out of the picture! if he still has feelings for you its better not to have him get close to your son, its not his baby and trying to be his dad isnt going to make you his girlfriend. but hes probably thinking it will help you get back together. as long as your son has a man in his life as he grows up it doesnt neccesarily have to be his father,it could be an uncle or grandfather or someone else|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Sounds complicated.  Every boy needs a good male role model in his life, and it is nice that Curtis is willing to step up to the task, but you have a couple problems.  He might be doing it simply to be close to you and if you aren't interested then if you do start dating another man, curtis won't be too happy, and your son could suffer.  The other problem is that there is nothing other than his word to keep him around, so what if someday he decides other things are more important than being there for a child who isn't even his child?  Your son would suffer.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	Trust your instincts. They are rarely wrong. Good Luck.
SEzIkGNiaa	Just hand out flyers to neighbors/people you know with children, eventually the word will get out there that you babysit.  And of course, ask people to recommend you.  Also remember , to be yourself! :)|`|TL6c0Ntcaa	Seems to me that you are an honest person. I feel you would benefit from doing a accredited course in child care. This would boost your self confidence and in turn people would recognise that you are reliable and trustworthy. Remember, working with children is just as hard a job as being a parent and you are taking on a role as a babysitter that requires patience, understanding and above all Love.  God Bless You. Best of Luck.|`|oVcY7Bynaa	ask people to recommend you to their friends =]|`|kO65JfS8aa	Ask peopple at church if they want a babysitter, or if they can reccomend you.

I was thinking about asking the same question! But the answer depends on your age    If your 10-15:Act mature and confident, be polite-but still act like your a fun person around adults    If your 16-23:Be ready to handle all ages, your an adult now. And do everything from the younger age group.    23+up:Do everything listed|`|Gr78AFvyaa	get referrals from your teachers and the parents at church and post an add in your local news paper or flyers at your local grocery store.|`|lH0xtwXjaa	If take on a new job just let the parent know what other jobs you have done and give them names and phone numbers. That helped me a lot. If its an option you coule volunteer or actually work at a daycare center. My mom printed of little babysitting card or me at vistaprint.com that helped too.    Hope I helped!
kKD0m7qUaa	Itchy skin during pregnancy  By the BabyCenter editorial staff  Approved by the BabyCenter Medical Advisory Board  Is it normal to feel itchy during pregnancy?  It's not uncommon to feel itchy in some areas, particularly around your growing belly and breasts as your skin stretches to accommodate them. Pregnancy hormones may also be partly to blame.    About two-thirds of women also find that their palms and the soles of their feet get red and sometimes itchy during pregnancy. Experts think that this condition, which usually disappears right after delivery, is caused by an increase in estrogen.    Avoid hot showers and baths, which can dry your skin and make the itching worse. Use mild soap and be sure to rinse it off well and towel off lightly. Then slather on the moisturizer, preferably an unscented one because some scents can cause irritation. Try an occasional warm oatmeal bath (you can buy pre-mixed oatmeal bath preparations in drugstores). Wear loose cotton clothing and avoid going out in the heat of the day, since heat can intensify the itching.    Severe itchiness in the second or, more commonly, in the third trimester can be a sign of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy, a liver problem that affects up to 2 percent of pregnant women and may spell trouble for your baby. It happens when bile doesn't flow normally in the small ducts of your liver, causing bile salts to accumulate in your skin and make you itch all over.    The itching can be quite intense. The condition itself doesn't cause a rash, but you may end up with red, irritated skin with little cuts in areas where you're scratching a lot. Call your doctor or midwife immediately if you think you have cholestasis. If you do, you'll need to have blood tests to check your liver and ultrasounds to check on your baby. Depending on your health and your baby's condition, you may be induced before your due date. This problem goes away after you have your baby, though you may get it again with your next pregnancy.    Hope this helps - Good Luck!|`|JFjc5g8eaa	oh man yes i itch all over and i cant find out why im 7 weeks along|`|CT3hTng7aa	YES!  Ugh pregnancy symptoms are the worst!  I have the sore boobs, peeing every two hours, I'm constantly sick, and yes, in addition to feeling like my boobs weigh 20 pounds each, they were itchy.  I went to Babies R Us and bought this "Belly Butter"-it's cocoa butter and Vitamin E, and it's for stretch marks, but it really helps stop the itching.|`|ahDUOe48aa	i itch like im madd wen im at school or work i cant wait to come home undress take a shower and lotion my body|`|gx4s68s8aa	Yes, it happened to me.  You might try Aveeno Soothing Baby Lotion.  I tried several lotions but this one seems to work the best out of the ones I tried.  It has oatmeal in it.  Also if you don't end up using it all during your pregnancy then it is great for you baby after he/she is born.|`|iMULlxdgaa	yes.  cocoa butter helped lots!  I thought I had PUPPS during my second trimester.  (thats when you itch yourself to death bascially)  ANyway my doctor said that its just your galbladder malfuctioning.  It will hopefully go away soon.  In the mean time hot shower will make it worse, if you live in cold weather right now, the cold could be making your skin dry as well, and then just hormones in general.  Use cocoa butter its inexpensive remedy and helps keep skin really soft (but can be a bit greasy...) Also-take benadryl at night(and during the day if needed) ...it helped me get some much needed sleep! My itchiness happened during the night a lot.|`|640c4c1f67ea41221d49294d28e598d8aa	It's not uncommon to feel itchy, particularly around your growing belly and breasts as your skin stretches to accommodate them. Hormonal changes may also be partly to blame.    Some pregnant women find that their palms and the soles of their feet get red and sometimes itchy. This common condition may be caused by an increase in estrogen. It usually disappears right after delivery.    You may also find that things that normally make you itchy  dry skin, eczema, food allergies  make you even itchier when you're pregnant. Finally, there are certain conditions that occur during pregnancy that may cause you to feel itchy     Avoid hot showers and baths, which can dry out your skin and make the itching worse. Use mild soap and be sure to rinse it off well and towel off lightly. Then slather on an unscented moisturizer  some scents can cause irritation.    Try an occasional warm oatmeal bath. (You can buy oatmeal bath preparations in drugstores.) Wear loose cotton clothing and avoid going out in the heat of the day, since heat can intensify the itching.|`|9Gd231Qqaa	i would itch like crazy too, but it was just my belly.  I wouldn't itch it during the day, but at night... i would itch it in my sleep to the point that i would bleed.|`|1jwEqxFlaa	That is so funny you are asking this.  I am about to go crazy with itching.  My husband is on the way to the drugstore right now to buy some oatmeal bath I am hoping that will help some.  I looked it up and didn't find much information unless you have a rash.  I don't know about you but I don't have a rash.   Sorry I can't help more I'm looking for that answer too.|`|J7GTIE5raa	nope|`|dLaHowG9aa	It could be your hormones are affecting your skin. Low estrogen during pregnancy is common. Also a low thyroid level can cause itching.|`|6cUPKr7Paa	YES!  Although he didn't say it, I know my husband got tired of putting lotion on me.  AND I loved to take hot baths, which I know is not the best thing for itchy skin OR being pregnant.  But it made me feel better at the time.  Then my husband would do the lotion.  :o)  Ah!|`|UxG6CkU2aa	If you are itching badly let your doctor know. It is a symptom of a dangerous pregnancy condition. or it could just be dry skin, see if lotion helps.
E7ViD8EWaa	XD  I'm sorry, it's not nice to laugh, but I do that all the time...  It's nice to know I'm not the only one!    Try twisting your leg and wiggling at the same time.

Why don't you ask your parents or siblings to help you?|`|mPTBU0QDaa	If you slid in, you should be able to slide back out. Just reverse your motions that you did to get in that position.

0rUZm5CFaa	I'm 25 weeks pregnant and I own a construction company. If the house was built before the 70's then I would stay away from the damaged area. Led in the paint is the reason why. Plus most bathroom walls will have mold in them. And mold is not good for anyone. If you have to go in there, just wear a dust mask. You can get them from any hardwear store. You never know what could be "living" in the air now that there is damage. I hope you get it fixed soon. Good luck! :)|`|PlmT4lHXaa	Honestly, better safe than sorry. You never know whats in all that mess, I hope your boyfriend wouldn't mind doing it because its not worth it to have you and the baby sick!

The only time he's interested in talking to her...is when the topic is something sexual in nature. If the guy was genuinely interested,he would talk about other things and ask her out on a real date. Instead of playing games..|`|bSkYYRrEaa	I agree with Lu Lu.|`|jLYuqk1Jaa	I wouldnt get involved cuz sometimes girls can be crazy bout their boyz and they will say stuff to start stuff so i woulsnt get involved and if she gets hurt then youll be there to have her back|`|3tWRpNIZaa	Just tell her. Don't worry about hurting her feelings, it's for her own good. It will work out.
AOvtRBU9aa	It's not just solely on how much you make. You have to factor in what your monthly spending is. Between my husband and I, we bring home $10k a month but we also have 3 homes, lexus, brand new truck, and eat out every night. It seem the more you make the more you'll spend. You just have to make it work with your income. It gets easier. Try to save by breast feeding, using store brand diaper and wipes, etc. Work different shifts to save on daycare. When the housing market gets better and our cars are paid off, we will be selling one of our rentals so I can be a SAHM or work part-time. There is nothing worth missing out on precious time with your lo.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	depends on how u live and what you are willing to give up; work up  a budget, do research on baby/child needs and go from there....|`|oIFMohfUaa	I hate to say it, but you can never "afford" a baby...in theory.     You will always find something to spend a raise in pay on!      You just need to fit it in...    Good luck!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Once he gets a job. And you start a nest egg. I would say go ahead.|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	ONly you know if you will have enough money for baby. You know your rent,car payment, insurance cell phone, credit cards & any other monthly payments you have. Sit down look at your budget and you should be able to set aside a few hundred dollars per month and if you can do so and it not hurt then you should be okay. You have to consider diapers $20 per week, formula about $40 per week (varies for every baby depending on type of formula & amount eaten) clothes, meds, toys large items needed crib, stroller,car seat.    Children are expensive I recomend being able to save a lot for a good 6 months and if you can do so then you should be able to afford the baby    Good luck!!!|`|EmYNUZcXaa	i'm not sure. it depends on your rent, and bills you have. just calculate out how much you make each month, and subtract all the bills you have, then take into consideration: food, gas, extra average spendings and things like that. see how much you have left over after all that. babies are VERY expensive. my husband is in the Army and we have a set amount every month, but it can still be very tight with bills and unexpected spendings. i would make a spending log. for one month, track where all your money goes. see if you think your personally making enough. another thing that helps is to start buying for the baby early. when we found out i was pregnant at 6 weeks we bought a crib and changing table and things that didn't matter what the sex of the baby was. every paycheck we would buy stuff for the baby so that we didn't have to spend it all at one time. by spreading it out over the 8 or so months it was a lot easier on our bank account. also remember that having a baby is VERY expensive if you dont have that great of insurance. THANKFULLY (i'm very grateful) the Army paid for ours. otherwise we would have probably had to wait a few more years to afford a baby.    good luck to you and your husband. i wish you the best!!|`|Gdy6LSLeaa	if you wait till you can afford to have kids then youll never have kids. but a good preperation would be try to pay off as much debt as you can. that is what me and my hubby did while i was prego with  1. if you own your home you may be able to get a home equity line of credit (NOT A 2ND MORTGAGE) but we got one for about 14 grand and our payment is under 100 dollars a month.|`|cn91FeWcaa	uh yes.... u just have to budget|`|jYPeis3Saa	it really depends on how well you budget your money.  and what bills you pay each month and how much they are. and it depends on where you live.     i am a stay at home mom and my husband works. he makes enough to allow this.     if you $1300-$1500 a month is before taxes youll really only be bringing home about $1000 a month if that. Your husband will have to be able to find a job that pays at least $3000 a month or more after taxes or youll both have to work multiple jobs.       will you have enough? i have no clue. i dont know you. its really a question only you can answer. if a baby is what you really want, then youll need to make some sacrifices.|`|9ozDCTDTaa	It all depends, you need to sit down and look at your monthly bills.  Rent/morgage payments, car payments, college loans, food, internet, insurance...  then you will need to think about child care since it sounds like you will both be working, this can run you anywhere between  $400 - $1000 a month depending.  Then you have another $50 in diapers, $50 in medical (doctors or medicine...) each month,  formula can run you about $100 a month (breast feeding is a lot cheaper, but you will need a good pump), then you need to figure in money for clothes and some toys for baby.  You need to buy a stroller and crib up front, car seat.... it adds up very quickly.  Be very real about how you spend your money.  Babies are a great joy, but they can be stressful, you don't want to be worrying about money on top of it!  Here is a website that helps with how much money it cost to raise a child...  http://www.babycenter.com/cost-of-raisin...
39f0517ef76cfb6cf02c7bee6fa47a66aa	you really need to talk to an adult or a few adults... like your parents and school counselors/principals. you can't just ignore this... if he started acting like this after one remark you made.. he may be emotionally/mentally unstable.     yeah he may be messing.. but that is horrible and it IS HARASSMENT!!! you don't need to deal with this... talk to adults. seriously. soon.    and like someone else said.. show them the texts and what not.|`|r0ISrLc1aa	if you call your service company you can block phone numbers.    orr you can just tell the kid that you blocked him, he would never know and he'll stop eventually.    what a douchebag, though :( that suucks|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	show the principal and your parents|`|ULo8Cwdfaa	talk to a trusted adult about it, he's just mad because you turned him down.|`|UIILEn0Uaa	I think he might be messin' with ya.    but if ur worried,  take ur cell to the guidance office, or the principal, and let them read them.  when we do this at my school, the kid sending the bad texts, gets in trouble for harrasment.

DuLhv7Ajaa	I haven't used this brand, but introducing small amounts of meat proteins at this age is fine. Just be sure to only try one new "flavor" every few days so you can watch for food allergy reactions.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	Hi ya!    I used them. BIG variety.    At 6 months old you don't really want to start meats. You need to do fruits & veggies then around 7 months to 8 months you can start meats. That is what our daughter's pediatrician told us.    And they are the cheapest thus far at Walmart in case you wanted to know.|`|w7FSmSTnaa	yes i use them. i actually use all the brands just depends on what brands have what in stock. but i wouldn't introduce meat wait until 8 months they have a hard time digesting the proteins in meats. stick with the fruits and veggies|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	meat is fine... don't worry.. Jacob was on meats at 6 months. We use beechnut though.|`|FLpMShKNaa	I have used nature's goodness brand, my son liked them as good as any. Whether or not the 6 mos+ is appropriate depends on what he has eatne thus far. if you are like I was, and just starting solids at 6 mos., he should have single ingredient foods like fruits, single grain cereal or veggies first, and only one new food every few days. However, if he has already had a variety of foods, especially those in the jar he bought (say its chicken and green beans and he's tried both) its fine.  Hope that helps
KNxs4PrZaa	not really normal if he is asking how to turn on the tv.  My two year old can do that.  Dont be mean about it but just remind him adn prompt him to do things on his own.  Make suggestions on things he can do like, show him how to get a snack for himself and then next time he asks remind him that you showed him how.  Does he spend time at his mothers? i would bet that she babies him there?  There is nothing wrong with having him do simple things for himself at your house, infact i would say its time for a simple chore or two, helping clear dinner or picking up his toys.|`|SrJjWCVjaa	Let him know that you are no longer going to do those things, keep reminding him that he is a big boy and needs to learn to do things for himself, make a bug stink about it, if he is looking for attention he soon find out that he will get that attention from doing things for himself...Good luck|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	First stop comparing your child and your stepchild it's not a good habit for you to get into and you will convey your feelings that your child is superior to your stepchild even without verbalizing it...     Start slowly teaching your stepchild to be more independent..   Use a rewards system (stars on a chart for doing a task independently, X number of starts gets the child a small toy, treat, privilege.)      Use only a positive feedback system positive actions/ behaviors garner a positive reaction, negative actions/behaviors garner nothing..       Remember you are not going to be able to make your stepchild a clone of your child no matter how much you teach your stepchild.. So accept they are different individuals and enjoy them each for who they are...|`|mEKsbCw2aa	If he has been really spoiled yes its normal, Just to get attention.|`|WpR6QLHtaa	ya know this behavior maybe an attention deal not saying you dont give him attention but honestly maybe a i want all your attention and im gonna do whatever it takes to get it i know this is going to sound mean but maybe try to ignore him if he ask you to turn on tv dont r maybe try gettin him to do things for u turn the tables on him see where that gets ya|`|F6lZHRkVaa	He's either just trying to get your attention or he's a little slow.    Teach him everything one more time, and when he comes back the second time, say, "You remember how to do that. I'll watch you and make sure you get it right." The third time tell him, "You remember how to do that. I'm not going to do it for you."    Be firm but gentle. And whatever you do, DON'T compare your kid to your stepkid. You'll drive yourself crazy. Talk to your stepkid's father if the issue is getting out of hand. But don't compare your kids or you will always look at your stepson as having less value than your birth son. Kids are smart and pick up on these things.    Good luck!|`|c8a188861f0a854648ff16ed2a2476a9aa	Get used to it. My son is 18 and I'm still picking up his dirty underwear off the bathroom floor.|`|AA11238703	just help him figure it out for himself instead of doing it for him  "here let me show you how to do that"  "oh, here's how you do that"  "can you do it?"  "let's see if you can do it yourself"  he probably hasn't learned because things were done for him.  he doesn't know anything different.  it's not something bad about him.  you can show him a new world.  different families are different but what you have to offer is helpful.  don't interpret it as him being lazy or bad, he has just had a different life.  kids are different.  kids are different.  just help him get to where he needs to be without criticizing or acting like he has a problem.  be patient.    asking questions when you already know the answer is usually a seeking of attention.  perhaps he needs attention.  give him attention when he acts independently and you will both get your needs met:  "wow, you did that by yourself"  "wow, you figured that out on your own!"  "hey show me how to do that, i don't know"
M1gL4Jd6aa	I spotted on one occasion with my first pregnancy which I now believe was implantation bleeding.  The blood was brown in colour which means it has come from your uterus and is fairly old. This can happen fairly early on in the pregnancy from about 3-4 weeks pregnant.  This may be what you are experiencing.  As for pregnancy tests, sometimes they can take a while to work. You have to wait for your hormone levels to build up enough before they work and some women take longer than others.     Wait another week and take another test.  I know it is hard to be patient, but you have to be!  In the meantime your period may make an appearance, but fingers crossed it won't!!|`|KozoNqpsaa	For some women, hpt's never show up as positive.

I was around 6-8 weeks pregnant then, but had a positive straight away (even at 3pm in the afternoon).     Generally, spotting may mean that your period is coming soon or it could be implantation bleeding.    You can always opt for a blood test at the doctors. =]
Pj7PLfK9aa	You probably have nothing to worry about, just get in to see an OB this week to put your mind at ease. Explain to the OB office that you have had incidence of miscarriage before and hopefully they will get you in asap.    I didn't even know I was pregnant until I was 5 weeks and had no symptoms at all other than being tired a lot...so no symptoms isn't anything to be worried about.    Also, do not take hot baths as someone suggested above. My OBs (I have three- high risk) have said that is a big no-no. It can cause a miscarriage in some cases and or put the baby at risk by raising its body temp. Even at 32 weeks I'm still taking mildly warm baths. My Perinatologist said not to take a bath in water any warmer than your own body temp.    Take care and try not to worry too much and congrats!|`|kKmuFi4zaa	Well, that depends on why you miscarried the other two times. You may have a negative blood type or some other problem.|`|AhBM5w8maa	Well don't get all worried because that is stressing you and your body out.  So lay down and relax and don't worry about it as of now.  Think positive and congratulations!!!  =)|`|Jn1ZfBxlaa	Think positive! You'll be fine and congrats!|`|Om1yADWRaa	Its never nice to have a miscarriage but you need to keep your guard up a little till your about 10 weeks but i'm really pleased you've got this far but its a milestone in itself the fact that you want to tell perfect strangers about your wonderful news means your feeling good about it already good     luck in the future.|`|6avKnzkoaa	Normally, they say that once you've reached 12 weeks it's considered a safe zone and others say that once a heartbeat is seen/heard the percentage drops as well. Ultimately, all you can do is relax and let nature take its course. Congratulations and I wish you all the best.|`|nsGBwXCTaa	I no that you are scared but you need to not think bad thoughts . I found out that I had cancer in jan 2008 and I do not right this min ,but if I sat and thought about it 24/7 I would drive my self scrasy but You just need to think good all the time and god will be with you all the time god nose best right . WAY TO GO BE HAPPY|`|sngEejAVaa	Pour yourself a nice hot bath and lay in it... I hope all goes really well for you... Maybe the 3rd time is the charm - not the disapointment.  Good luck to you and stay positive about this, dont let yourself down...|`|6yYeCVQFaa	Congrad's to you!!!!! I am not sure about the chances of miscarrying again but I know stress is not going to make it any better for you or the baby. Focus more on reading, or hanging outside of your thoughts with friends. Relax hun!|`|wufY5yXkaa	actually, tinabill1997 told you to take a hot bath to relax.  i'd seriously recommend against that.  a bath over 100 degrees can damage developing cells in your fetus.       good luck!|`|mgEs4nK5aa	Every woman is different, you're "lack" of symptoms isn't irregular at all. One of my cousins didn't have any real symptoms, outside of some extra peeing which didn't even start till after the 2nd term.    One thing I'd like to point out asap is DO NOT take hot baths or hot showers its actually a bad thing to do when pregnant, especially going in jacuzees and shaunas.    I'd say just start out thinking positive it really helps to calm your nerves and help you not worry so much. When you feel real tired make sure to rest. You don't have to actually go to sleep if you're not sleepy just laying down and resting is enough.     Always go to your doctor for anything. Never be afraid of "bothering" him/her about anything. You may have to wait for a call back but at least you can keep your doctor up on how you feel and you can know whether or not you have anything that you should be concerned about.    Hmm another thing to watch out for (as your doctor probably already told you) is to stay away from caffeine as it can cause problems with your baby's development.    Honestly just try to stay stress free as much as you possibly can and if at any point you feel that something can harm you or you think it can cause harm to your baby don't do it and if its something like food to eat or things to drink or working out just call your doctor and ask them what they think you should do. Since you've made it to your 6th week without any problems its looks really good that this one will go to full term. GL ^^
FLOjzbKEaa	I like Manuel or Marsel.  You choose and Gongrats.|`|dPJr1Lbmaa	Sorry don't like Karson or Kaden :S Or Jaden or Haden yuck and Karson just makes me think "Queer eye for the straight guy" SORRY people but whatever you choose to call your beautiful baby boy really all that matters is that YOU and your HUSBAND like it. Not us random people on Yahoo :)      No one is saying its not fun for you to discuss it or to be here. I was just giving you my opinion of the names you did ask people to give there opinion, didn't you? And all I was trying to say in my answer was even though I dont like it who cares its your baby.

nBlSS6HUaa	She might have an infection. (ear, sinus, etc) My daughter had bad diarrhea, and a runny nose, and I dealt with it for over a week, tried the 'normal' things. No juice, only water and milk,tried "thicker foods" and nothing worked. Finally her dr demanded that he see her (he even stayed after the office closed to see her) and sure enough...she has a extremely bad ear infection (takes after me) and a really bad sinus infection. So now she has to take a double round of medicine. And she's all better! Diarrhea went away, eating better, feeling better, and even looking better.  You might want to have her checked out. DR's can see things we can't (ears, throat, sinus stuff, feel the tummy, etc)    Good luck and I hope she gets better soon!|`|jZguzD2Raa	call a doctor|`|LJhrtN9Uaa	my son gets like that to, but i give him cheese cubes when he gets like that and a little pedialite and then hes good the next day... u can also dilute the milk a little bit, my oldest son is 2 1/2 and my youngest is 15 months and i still dilute there juice 1/2 and 1/2 and a little water in there milk.. good luck|`|27d56c06ceccc45d5e89e737fce397ddaa	Teething..?!  Try giving her some binding foods such as bananas, rice, apple sauce, toast.
6yYeCVQFaa	He doesn't have to ejaculate inside of you to get you pregnant. One drop of sperm can be just enough to get you pregnant. I used KY Jelly when I got pregnant, which is famous for killing sperm. Regardless those little guys are pretty powerful and can survive most anything, which is happy thoughts for some of us and scary thoughts for the rest of us. My first symptom was cramping and then breast tenderness started. I didn't experience fatigue or morning sickness until 8 weeks into my pregnancy. Mind you, every pregnancy is different and all it takes is one determined little guy to make it to the egg. My suggestion? Take a pregnancy test the week of your expected period and don't stress out. My future advice? Use protection if you guys aren't ready for a baby. I wish you the best.|`|nl7tkxc3aa	WHY  DO  PEOPLE  ALWAYS  ASK  THIS  QUESTION      HOW  AM  I SUPPOSE  TO  KNOW?    WKJBGWGLBSDLFGBAJFBA!!|`|dDDAbqqhaa	you're lucky I didn't copy and paste the face palm.    CHECK WITH THE DOC!|`|pKr77Vqiaa	prego|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	you could be take a test|`|5yAsj29Vaa	What does going to the bathroom have to do with anything?  It's a myth that going to the bathroom between ejaculations decreases the risk of pregnancy.  If you're not educated enough to know that, you're not educated enough to be having sex.  Are you also worried about the STD's or STI's you could get from having unprotected sex?  Or are you ok with AIDS but not a baby?  Your symptoms are related to PMS and pregnancy symptoms.  The best pregnancy symptom is a missed period, so wait and see if you get your period.  In the meantime, you should get tested for diseases and infections since that is a risk that comes with unprotected sex.|`|HhY4Oul2aa	omg i feel the same way cept i was on the day after peiod ended and i am also very fertile and we had unprotected sex|`|76SAdZ19aa	Take a pregnancy test. Good luck :)|`|lQjWLffmaa	Probably|`|sLEoWYr5aa	It could be a sex related illness but don't panic, it won't be serious. Go see your doctor or do a pregnancy test to see if you're pregnant.|`|9z5YJKqLaa	congratulations! you may be pregnant!|`|ZaVPaDGhaa	sounds like you are pregnant to me. The tender breasts is a big sign of being p.g  I would suggest getting tested ASAP and then if you are, find out about your options.|`|EPki0rwgaa	You should think of the consequences of your actions.|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	It might just be PMS.  That's how I feel before my periods.  But that is also how I felt when I was preggo, but it was after my missed period.  If you miss your period take a test.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	The only thing that you can do now is to wait until your missed period and take a home pregnancy test. Those are all the symptoms of pregnancy.|`|949AJbB6aa	Magic eightball says "ask pregnancy test"|`|2qktUSFDaa	yeh|`|BEdDAm20aa	pee on a stick and wait till it turns blue|`|NekOuxFEaa	Just take a pregnancy test?  But you probably are, unprotected sex 3 times when a guys cumming, you never know. Especially with precum and some could slip.|`|ORpCyrifaa	There is a very good chance that you are pregnant but the only way to make sure is to get a pregnancy test at your local drug store or call your doctor.|`|i2ObfVJtaa	Uh you have some symptoms so i would go and get a test..|`|9sKSkKTJaa	Tender breast is a major, often first give away. But you could also experience these symptoms with your period. Take a test right away. If your sexual experience was within the last 72hrs you could try "plan B" but many people are against this form of birth control although it is not the abortion pill. Otherwise, if you are happy about the possibility of being pregnant, congrats!|`|AA10838261	Yes you are. you are having Disionprenatal-Bypass. Your Missed Period will come in about 5 days.
kcQQ0lqtaa	It isn't safe to give a baby that young water--my daughter is 7 months and when I asked the doctor this week she said not to give her water yet.  So I imagine they'd say the same for a 4 month old.      Formula is expensive, but if you're just giving your baby a couple of ounces now and then she should be okay.  And this way she's getting nutrients in addition to being hydrated.    Have you tried other teething remedies?  Teething tablets may help, or a toy for her to chew or suck on.  My daughter's favorite teething toy is actually a baby spoon we feed her solids with--I guess the soft part of the spoon part.feels good to her!    Good luck!  Teething bites.  (pun intended)  :)|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i wouldn't give any water to one so young without talking to the doc and if they say it is ok, ask them how much is the limit in 24hrs...|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I believe that this is generally considered a bad idea until they are a bit older, perhaps 6 months.    At four months their stomachs are still tiny, filling her up with water would fill her stomach, but not give her any nutrients.  It's not like water itself would hurt her though, it's just that she sort of needs to maximize her tiny stomach.    Have you tried a pacifier between feedings?|`|Gdy6LSLeaa	i would try maybe 2oz and se how she is. it should be fine i started giving my son juice and water at 4 months.|`|3bf411fb0977582b031f408308f1234baa	NO NO NO water.    Just nurse her.  Yes its a sacrifice but its well worth it.|`|95PDOYyoaa	i was told not to give small babies water because if they drink too much plain water it could make there brain swell, im sure that would have to be alot of water. but i read that you should start sips of water to babies when they start sitting up on their own. i guess that a good time for them or something. my three month old is always trying to suck the water of the washcloth in the bathtub and i dont think it hurts anything.|`|BhYwYzuDaa	I woudnt think it would hurt but you can never be too careful.    The reason kids get food allergies is because the parents give the baby foods WAY TOO EARLY, ASK YOUR DOCTOR!    Another reason babies develop food allergies is because their filtering system is not developed enough.|`|2z84P93caa	i'm not sure  but water IS the most natural thing we've got    so, logically it should be fine|`|UCo9GgcAaa	Our doctor didn't recommend that until 6 months.   I wet a washcloth with really cold water, ring it out, and let her suck on it and that helps with teething A LOT!!   Some people put it in the freezer for a few minutes.  But it seems to work just with cold water.
AA10624857	Double check with your pediatrician as I don't think there are any commercially made infant formulas that don't contain some iron. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in infants. You may be able to find a low-iron brand of formula, but the American Academy of Pediatrics does not endorse it's use. There is actually no proof that iron in formula causes constipation. Actually, few babies who are exclusively breast or formula fed are truly constipated. Going several days between bowel movements as well as grunting, turning red, straining, and fussing are normal infant behaviors when it comes to passing stool. Infants with constipation typically have hard, tiny, pebble-like stool when they do pass it. Difficulty passing stool is normal because of the baby's still developing digestive system.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i have always used one with iron; when she gets constipated , which is rarely, we have always been told by our doc to use a little juice to start the engine...why don't u ask doc which he would recommend? the best would probably be the same brand you are using just without the iron..where does he suppose the baby is going to get iron from?|`|Gdy6LSLeaa	i use the generic walmart brand sensitive. it was better then similac in my opinion and his spitting up was cut by more then half.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	I honestly haven't heard of a formula that does not contain iron. Why don't you want your baby to ingest iron?|`|TvO3eVIMaa	really? your baby needs iron its very important... i wouldnt do no iron unless your pediatritian says so|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I use nestle good start supreme and Jacob does really well with it.     We tried Enfmail and Similac and he didn't do so well.    Edit: oh sorry.. I read your question wrong.. they all have iron but I know they all have kinds that don't.|`|95PDOYyoaa	i use nutramigen by enfamil, i dont believe it has iron in it. but it is expensive!!!! like $26 for a small can of the powder, but its the only thing my daughter can drink, i dont think she has a milk allegery it was just the only thing that agreed with her. good luck!|`|UXhFcHCHaa	does she need a lactose free formula? i think all formula contains iron maybe just not as much as some of the other kinds. try similac lactose free formula. my little one uses this kind and we saw a diffrence by his second bottle.
AA12113354	my mom is like that to but i think is b/c were girls and some parents say that guys can take care of themselves    like for me i cant really go any where but my brother can and he's 13 and i am 15!!!!! i think they are being sexist|`|k6M48eUMaa	No that is so not fair!|`|gILygKvRaa	WTF!!!|`|sngEejAVaa	How old is your brother?

Stop feeling sorry for yourself for one moment and step into your mothers shoes ..... Life is no longer safe like way back when - as they say, and your mom is only trying to protect you.  A parents sense of worry and care run so deep - most of the time you probably have no idea, that being a parent is a tuff job.     Now if you are as responsible as you say, then act like the responsible one, earn some money for expenses in case you do travel, and when the time is right, and you know your mom sees the change in you - talk to your friends and ask one of them to ask their parents to ask your mom if you can go visit for a holiday.  If it is from an adult and you have the fare to travel - there would be very few obstacles for your mom to worry about.      Is this not the far more responsible and easier way to get what you want ?|`|Jegvchhnaa	No that is totally NOT fair!!!!!|`|39f0517ef76cfb6cf02c7bee6fa47a66aa	how old is your brother? have you shown your mom you can be responsible???? your mom may also probably be sad that you are growing up... and she doesn't want to accept that. she may just want you to stay her baby-girl for forever.|`|1tqwkvtXaa	its because your a girl....i know how u feel.
JP2h62qiaa	yes. IT is natural for you to get really sick when going into labor/prelabor stages. You can get diarrhea and vomit a lot. You body wants to get every thing out before labor for when you have to push.  It  have muscle aches and pains. I felt like this for 3 days before loosing my mucous plug and going into full labor right after.|`|76b2313ad607b0e7b0eb85999b17c136aa	no, but when i got to the hospital with my second i had bad diarrhea.  I was thinking "oh boy, i'm not in labor i just had to poop!!"  But i ended up being in labor hehehe|`|Gdy6LSLeaa	i have heard of people being sick during labor. they always say dont go to the hospital too soon or they will just send you home, but if you are in pain and you cant take it anymore then go and get some pain relief. too bad you cant keep anything down cuz they dont let you eat during labor. if you go dont go the the er just go straight to the labor and delivery floor. call them first i know our hospitals labor and delivery has its own entrance.|`|rdpZrBc9aa	I did, if you mean stomach flu.  I was sick at both ends, but it wasn't stomach flu, it was a baby!|`|EmYNUZcXaa	yes most definitely. it was awful...diarreah, the whole shebang...i knew it wasn't the flu cuz i had my flu shot. two days later i lost my mucus plug and my water broke 30 mins later :)|`|ZT9Zap0faa	Yep! I did. When I got pregnant with my twins, I thought that I had gotten the stomach flu, because my husband had it. Little did I know that we were throwing up for two very different reasons. My flues were born five months ago, September 27. In labor though, I kept going to the bathroom, constantly. The poop started at my Mother-In-Law's birthday party. Then my water broke. Let me just say that the chair has never been or smelled the same. Anyway, you probably are going to be in labor soon. These are tell-tell signs. Wait a few hours to see what happens. Your baby's ready!

Bw18seFqaa	make sure the baby isnt too hot or cold.    make sure she's not in pain..  diaper isnt too tight, a hair or thread isnt wrapped around a toe, etc.    just try holding the baby..  make calm shhh noises.    the baby could be over stimulated.. if you have music or tv going..  try going to a dim, quiet room, rock the baby and shhh to see if that calms her down.      for teething, if there's no teethers or baby oragel..  try a clean damp wash cloth.. put in the freezer to make it cold, and then offer to the baby to chew on.      Do not medicate the baby until you talk to your aunt.    If you get too frustrated, but the child in her crib and walk away for 5-10 mins to calm yourself down..  she will be safe in her crib, even if she is crying.    She may also just be tired.      ADDED  I know people are offended that you are referring to the baby as "It", and that you are making comments like "it wont shut up"..     it can be very frustrating to deal with a fussy baby.. even more frustrating when you are young, and its not your own baby!   I cant stand it when other people's kids cry, but something about my own baby is different.. I am learning her cries and what she wants.   I think part of your comments and the way you are wording things is out of frustration.  Obviously you do care for your little cousin, otherwise you wouldnt be asking what may be wrong.|`|AA12243380	This is why my children have never been left alone with anyone other than a grandparent.|`|eooRspsPaa	the best thing to do is not get frustrated a baby can tell when you frustrated and it makes them un comfortable and walking around with them won't help either because it makes them want to be walked around all the time  the best thing to do is be calm and non-frustrated|`|BcjFssaEaa	glad u sorted it i hate teething babies xxxx|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if it is teething, look around for baby teethers in the toy box; you can wet a rag and put in the freezer just long enough to get it cold, if they don't like it cold try warm or room temp and let them  chew on that...the baby may need a nap, that will cause fussiness; call your aunt back and ask her what she does this time of day when baby is upset; how she calms her, if it is nap time, if she's hungry, what? have you checked her diaper?is she too cold or too hot? is she bored? try playing with her with some of her toys...if that doesn't work and it is nothing of the above, try a cartoon channel...my dd loves noggin channel|`|aJLx0nhNaa	At 10 months old she can tell that you're a stranger.  She can also tell if you're frustrated with her.  And she might be missing her mom.      If there's really nothing wrong with her I'd try sitting with her quietly and playing a game with her or singing a song.  Sit on the ground with her and see if she wants to play.  Try to read her a book.  Put on some music and dance with her.  Make friends!  She might not trust you yet and you need to earn her trust.    Edited:  Please don't give her Tylenol, as another poster suggested.  You should not medicate her without her mother's explicit instructions to do so.|`|nYI8eB0Baa	Sometimes baby cry...just do what you are doing...and "it" may just want mommy.|`|oIFMohfUaa	First of all...do NOT give any meds without mom's permission!

Try singing, talking, rocking the baby.  She may be missing her mum.  If you are really struggling try contacting her mum and asking her what to do or ask her to come home.|`|95PDOYyoaa	sounds like a bit of colic. best advise is to stay calm and relaxed, babies feel your stress and will stress out themselves. just take a breather if you have to set it down and get a drink (non alcoholic of course, lol) it will be fine for all of a minute while you calm yourself down so it will be able to calm down. try rocking, humming or singing to it, maybe swaddle it up. just try to relax thats what i have to do with my three month old. good luck!!|`|dcNmRPGPaa	sounds like colic...do they have a vaporizer? if so sit with baby in the room with the vaporizer.
F6lZHRkVaa	I think it's lazy. My mother is white and she found black women to give her advice on styling my hair. I had all sorts of cute hairstyles simply because my mom took the time to educate herself.    I wouldn't give anyone a buzz cut at 4 years old. I love to see a toddler with lots of wild hair.|`|AA10494763	if it s a boy I see no issue.   My mom is Puerto Rican but with straight hair and never learned to deal with my hair my  black dad gave us.  She says all the time we weren't girls.   Now if it is a girl I see nothing wrong with short mangable cut but  not a buzz cut.  Now for a boy no big deal.|`|Bu6eSZSlaa	Because of the combination of white/black hair it most likely is a bit difficult to comb so the mom chose to cut if off instead of hassling with trying to get it comb|`|0LHw7Ve5aa	I think that as long as the child's happy then it's okay. If you;re white then it obviously will be hard working out what to do with their black daughters hair.  I wouldn't give my 4 year old daughter a buzz cut, no. I'd go to a hairdressers, preferably the ones for black people, and I'd ask them for advice, and/or just take my daughter there every month to get her hair plaited.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	I have two children from adoption that are from Africa.     I think that a very important piece about transracial adoption (and something  very much overlooked) is the need to learn how to care for ethnic skin and hair.      My son wears a buzz cut.  We keep his scalp and hair moisturized.    I take my daughter to a lady who braids hair.  We've been doing micro-braids for over a year now.  They are very easy to care for and only need to be re-done every couple of months or so.  We use a spray daily and a wrap at night.      If a mom can't braid hair (like me) then she needs to take her daughter to someone who can.  And no, unless there was some major reason for it, I would never make a 4 year old white daughter wear a buzz cut.|`|2ydF6OTAaa	Bi-racial kids huh? Well hair traits will be the result of two worlds. I don't think it's a good idea to cut their hair off. You just need to talk a/ a hair stylists or hair shop owner about the kind of products you should be looking for.     W/e you do, just don't use any relaxers, those are harmful in the end.    To your second part. I don't have kids, but hell no, I would never give that child a buzz cut.|`|AcmfbJVpaa	I don't see a problem there|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	I think she should take her child to someone that knows how to handle it.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I think they are too lazy to want to deal with it!!

I keep my sons hair short but I still do it every day.|`|MzHwklzKaa	I HAVE heard of white people doing this!    There's a myth that if you buzz cut a kid's hair it grows back thicker, darker and more attractive. (no matter what race the child is)  Maybe these people believe that and hope to improve the child's hair.   It's silly, but friends and family still occasionally butcher a poor little girl's hair.    I've never seen anyone buzz cut a kids hair because they didn't want to deal with it.    Where I'm from, mixed hair is considered beautiful.    Maybe the person you're refering to is mean.  Maybe there's another reason the child's hair was cut off.|`|TL6c0Ntcaa	Maybe the Mum should be asking her black husband or friends how to handle the little girls hair. Obviously she has a problem if the "buzz cut" is necessary.   Personally, I Love the the little ones with their crazy curly frizzy hair !|`|2wBfPVRAaa	I think it's awful that a mom would hack off her daughter's hair instead of styling it!     As a white woman, if I had a biracial/black child, I would learn how to properly take care of her hair!  So, for me personally, I would NOT give my 4 year old daughter (black or white) a buzz cut!!!|`|b5UV15gCaa	I do not think you should shave any little girls head. Find a way for it to be beautiful long. My niece is black and my family is white. If you are going to to raise someone of a different ethnicity... you need to learn about the needs for that ethnic group weather it is for hair styling or what ever. Otherwise I think a person could be called lazy for not trying.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	Well I can't really answer because I don't have any biracial children, but the way I see it, if it's my daughter and I'm the one styling and caring for her hair, then it should be the way I want it until she is old enough to take care of it herself.    When my daughter was a toddler we grew her hair out, and went through countless episodes of de-tangling and her fussing and crying and it was very trying and stressful sometimes. When she got older and started wanting to care for her own hair, we cut it short so that it would be easier for her to brush and wash (around 6 years old).  I let her grow it out but it's a lot harder for her to care for, we both enjoy the ease of it being short (shoulder length) and it's a very cute style for her too.|`|LJhrtN9Uaa	hey as long as she looks cute and ur happy and shes happy then so be it!!!
35945512fbc551d838d93d04aad5f789aa	I basically felt like she was going to fall out whenever I wasn't sitting. On the day of my labor, I basically felt like I was on the first day of my period (which is the worst day).|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	Oh the whole week , I was tired, weak, felt like I was coming down with something, and the a day before I was suppose to be induced but started labor as well before inducing, I felt better, I couldn't sit down. My mom kept getting mad at me, she wanted me to rest.     I hope you start to feel better...like my mom would say .."REST NOW MISSY!!!"   Congrats!!!|`|EmYNUZcXaa	i had our daughter at 38w4d and two days before i had her i felt like i had the stomach flu...it wasnt' though cuz i had the flu shot 2 months earlier. i just remember being suuuuper miserable and feeling awful. the last month and a half all i did was lay down and sleep.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	Like cleaning the whole house. l could'nt stop cleaning which is not normal for me. But yeh l felt like crap and had constant heartburn. Good luck with the birth, may it be short and you are both a-ok XX|`|UxG6CkU2aa	Well, it was different with all 3 of my pregnancies. But I did feel crampy with all of them. With my first, I felt like I needed to go to the bathroom( 2) so bad for an entire day, but nothing would happen when I tried to go. And then the contractions started one on top of the other.  With the second one I was so miserable I spent my entire final week soaking in the bathtub, because it was the only thing that made me feel good. With the third I had the diarreah(sp?) for the whole day.  I never had lost a mucous plug or had any kind of discharge beforehand on any of them. But I did feel terrible before going into labor each time. Just hang in there it will all be over before you know it. Just try to relax and enjoy your pregnancy as much as possible, I know its hard sometimes, but hang in there and good luck!!!|`|uj1A73ZGaa	I felt great when I had my twins. I wasn't suppose to have them until Dec. 14th but they came on November 22nd.    Good luck and best wishes to you for a safe delivery|`|2MKvrydWaa	i had really bad diarreah and was nauseas(sorry if TMI),i was alittle more tired then usual,i had braxton hicks contractions more often,and i was really moody and impatient.that was like a week before i went into labor.then i had her at my 38th week.|`|jYPeis3Saa	i actually felt fine
9ozDCTDTaa	When our daughter got croup at 7 months old, she also ran a fever.  She got red spots all over (but they don't sound as bad as your son's).  My DR said that babies can get a rash towards the end of an illness and for my little one this turned out to be true, she was feeling much better a day or two later.  Best of luck and I hope your little one feels better soon!    EDIT:  is your child vaccinated?  I only asked because croup like symptoms and a chest rash can also be an indicator of the measles (even though this is HIGHLY unlikely)|`|gGW7K9U5aa	My daughter had croup when she was bout 5 months old and she was on antibiotics for it. So sorry to hear about that!  She also has eczema as well. The doctor prescribed her a topical steriod and it helped a little. But I see waht others have bought for their little one and Ill probably try something else.  Ive read alot on eczema, and it could be caused by allergies. My daughter has it really bad on her cheeks, arms and legs. Her skin also gets really dry. She is allergic to cinnamon so far. And Im watching closely for others. I would keep a close eye on what shes eating and if it seems to get worse, then write it down and keep track of it.   Good luck!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Oh I hope your little guy gets better soon. Both of my kids have had croup and it is awful. I hate that cough, it makes you want to cry!! It may be an allergic reaction to something, or it may be a rash due to the high fevers. If they start getting itchy then take him into an urgent care or the ER. Good luck!!|`|NDTLI64kaa	Oh, I feel for you...croup is not fun! Was your son put on a nebulizer to receive breathing treatments? If not, a liquid steroid for really bad coughing fits will help at night. Also, you can steam up the bathroom and let him inhale the moist air. Do u use a humidifier at night? You know that the croup just needs to run it's course. As for the bumps, could it be keratosis? Basically it's just clogged pores, similar to zits but not nearly as bad. My son has it as well. Using Eucerin Plus can help clear them up - using normal lotions, like Johnson and Johnson, won't help. Also, your son's skin might start to get dry so watch out for that. I wouldn't put hydrocortizone on it until you either have a second opinion or your son begins to be bothered by the bumps. Hope this helps, good luck :)|`|c76bc0ffbd77bfaaa2937eb65cf4e252aa	My 5 month old daughter has/had eczema. It was itchy for her, and I could see scratch marks from where she tried to relieve it. We used Cetaphil for about 3 days and it hasn't returned. The eczema was mainly on her tummy and legs, tiny red bumps, looked like a rash, but was very dry. She would cry when she rolled onto her tummy because it was irritated. Hope this helps. Just my experience. I'm not familiar with croup.|`|YJNql5Mgaa	Hi, I had eczema as a child-still have it now- but hydrocortizone is what my parents put on me as a baby.      However, if he's not scratching... my guess is that its not eczema.
74008e5e3a8a4192f40444bc93d2b1c2aa	Ever heard the statement that "Its not funny until someone gets hurt"? Well this is one of those situations. Why are you feeding the dog at the table if your mom has told you repeatedly not to? If you want to feed him a little extra from your plate, then leave a little to feed him when you are done. Then not only are you and the dog happy but so is your mom bc her rules are being followed.|`|4t6ABZcfaa	how cute a penis troll (everyone go awww)|`|rNdun1V7aa	everyone except the person with with the injury finds injuries to the balls entertaining. mostly because y'all are such dramatic babies about it. hahahahahahahaha|`|vfhKkiSKaa	Haven't you ever watched America's Funnies Home Videos?  They must have at least 3-4 clips and episode of someone getting in in the balls and everybody laughs.    I guess we have all just been desensitized to it and find it funny.|`|d9b1447951374df512b15ee98c0bf39daa	she wasnt laughing that you got hurt, she was laughing at you getting hurt doing something she told you to not do.
X9JSlC6Iaa	I'm sure she wasn't laughing at the fact that your dog it your balls, but the fact at what your sister said. How old is she?|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	LMFAO XD|`|gILygKvRaa	yes. it's true. lol. very. hahahahahha. I'm sorry  i cant stop laguhing
yOaGKfP2aa	I was always told to give the baby the veggies first. I was also told to introduce green veggies first, then orange, and then give the baby the fruits after you have gone through everything else. I was told that the reason for this is because if fruits are introduced first, that will be the only thing the baby wants to eat, because they are sweeter. Also there is not much difference between first and second foods. you probably could save a little bit if you used second foods, Just don't go to third foods yet because they are very chunky and the baby at 3 months isn't ready for that yet.     Basically though, give her a new veggie every 3 days, and then introduce fruits when you run out of veggies..I hope this helps.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	any stage ones should be ok if she did fine with the others..my dd loves oatmeal too...we use beechnut|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Though you are early on the foods and everything i read says to wait until 5 1/2 to 6 months... if you're ognna do it anyhow i'll tell you this: i was told that it doesn't really matter the order, but that yellow foods are gentler on the tummy (squash, bannana, apple pear) then move to orange (carrot, sweet potato) then greens (peas, green beans). By the time you get through those (waiting 4-7 days inbetween new foods) you can introduce regular oatmeal or a mixed grain oatmeal.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	You are supposed to do one kind at a time for about a week so that you know they are not allergic to them. Go with veggies first then do fruits. That way they get used to the veggies and want to eat them. The fruits are sweet so once they start eating them they like them better.|`|77700ae60cac2abd41d7a7f8bd98336aaa	Sounds like your doing fine. Cereal, veggies, meat and fruit last.  Years ago that is what my ped told me. The idea being that they develope a taste for fruit last. Because fruit is sweet most babies like it and if they get a taste for that first it will be harder to get them to eat the other things they need|`|Gdy6LSLeaa	start with the green veggies first, they are most bitter. they might act like they dont like it but after a few feedings she might change her mind. stage one is what you want to start with and when it seems like shes still hungry then move to stage 2 since they are bigger. the stage 3 has chunks of veggies in it, so you dont need that for a while.|`|axheoEN4aa	Pot|`|UCo9GgcAaa	Usually they recommend you only introduce new foods no sooner than every 3 days or so.  They recommend you start with veggies so they get used to eating those prior to starting fruits.|`|oEdgddQPaa	my daughter loves cauliflower cheese  from the jar its quite nice also veg and turkey cassarole good luck|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Change your doctor!! You shouldnt be introducing any solids till 6 months (very earliest 4 months).|`|lSAdkvDFaa	You shouldnt really start with food until baby is about 4 months old and especially in her bottle as babies can choke. Lay off the food for a little while and then. Rusk is a good starting point and it should be almost as runny as baby milk is at first then gradually going a bit thicker. Baby rice is also good.|`|2s4jLzLaaa	bannas apple sauce|`|sAhAEC2qaa	always go 3 days in between foods. start w/ orange stage 1s    btw: this girls doc told her to do this. this mom and her doc see the baby on a regular basis, not all you Y!A ppl. so give her answers to the ? she asked, don't say oh stop doing that its bad. thats not what was asked. do you really think some1 will listen to advice they are being given that they never even asked for?
1G3XPiq3aa	I think one gift I got that I didn't think very much of at the time was a whole stack of cloth baby nappies. Not the newer ones that have a shape, but the big white cloth squares. I put them on top of her blanket that she was lying on when she had floor time, or over her clothes when she was feeding, or over my shoulder when I was burping her, and they saved so much mess from baby spew where bibs wouldn't have.|`|a095159fe0597a1cbcdff915d247b333aa	Best advice I was ever given as a new mom:    Always trust your instincts.|`|c55O7jqXaa	I got this very soft receiving blanket that is made of jersey te shirt material and my Daughter still has it today and she is almost 7-ha. I also got Chinese very thick diapers that I used like crazy for spit ups since she was a projectile vommiter I can tell you it can hold a whole bottle of formula-ha and I still use them these days for cleanups. They are awesome!!    Some things I never used were the bouncy seat, playpen, highchair, and swing. She just screamed when I tried to put her in them.    Most of those gagets that were suppose to make life easier just made it more complicated or she just didn't take to them.     You can never hold or love a baby too much. No you cannot "spoil" a baby by holding them too much. This is such a farce.     Tend to your baby when they cry and not let them "cry it out". Babies cry as a way of communicating and by tending your baby when they cry allows them to bond and form a trust with that person. They know that person will always be there for them when they need it.     If you ever find yourself comparing your child with others- stop and think how unique your child is and that he or she is not going to be like others. He or she will meet milestones at different times and it doesn't matter.     Don't be concerned about the percentile charts they have at the pediatrician. So many people put stock in these. Unless your child is truly ill and has fallen of the charts you shouldn't worry whether they are in the 99% or the 1%.     If you find yourself losing control or gonna yell put the baby down somewhere safe and go into another room and calm down before coming back. Count and breath before dealing with anything. We can't always be in a cheerful mood and I found this to be very helpful. Babies cries can sometimes get on your nerves no matter how strong of a person you are or how much patiences you have.     Remember they are only this young once so enjoy and savor every moment. If you have a chance to be home fulltime with your aby I encourage you to take it.

14JQ11AUaa	My son will be 4 1/2 months this Monday. I filed for his social security card the day after he was born. They told me it would take 8-10 weeks to receive it by mail. I still have not received it and again he is almost 4 1/2 months. I had to get his birth certificate, which was $20 and refile for his social security card. I did this last Tuesday, they said it would be another 4-6 weeks before we get it.|`|dTLTNZTzaa	I do not know about the rest of the states but in New York I received Social Security Card and Birth Certificate in about 3 weeks after baby was born and didn't have to pay a penny.

So no , it doesn't always take that long.  The Birth Cert. will also take that long if you have the hospital do it, and it is not free. You have to pay for it as well. You can go own to the Vital Records building( I went to my Environmental & Health Building)  and fill out paper work there and pay (but you have already done that) and you can have it that day. If you don't receive it by next week. I would call the numbers provided on the application and ask them if it has been sent off.    Congrats New Mommy!!!|`|EmYNUZcXaa	hmmm im not sure. maybe every state is different...we are stationed in Missouri and had our daughter 09 DEC 2008 and we had to send in $12 also and we received our birth certificate 2 weeks later and her SSN came the same week. When my mom had me (i was born in WA) she didn't have to pay for my birth certificate. hopefully you'll get yours sooner than they quoted you.
B9Yfgjcbaa	It is contagious and that is one way to get it very easily.  I would not suggest doing that unless your husband wears water shoes.  If his feet are covered, the baby should be fine.  If not, then your baby can very well get it.  Good luck and I hope I helped.|`|CzhNA9sXaa	NO GO TO THE LINK BELOW ME, please, it's very bad for your husband to do that with athlete's foot. It is contagious.    http://kidshealth.org/teen/infections/fu...
dTLTNZTzaa	I feel so bad reading this. My husband and I have 4 weeks old girl and OMG I would be so lost without him. I had c-section and was in such pain in the beginning that was not able to do anything. In the hospital all nurses were telling me how lucky I am to have help like my husband. He was changing diapers, feeding baby, would put her to sleep. When we got home I had so much support and with the house work that I gained my strength pretty fast. I do not cook (he would yell at me if I did anything but taking care of baby while he is at work). He makes me go to sleep whenever baby is sleeping and when he gets home and it is due for baby to get changed and fed he would never wake me up and would do it himself. I do laundry and keep the house clean and  take care of his business bookkeeping and he always tells me to take a brake and relax.   He appreciates me for giving him this baby and lets me know about it every day of our lives. He always tries to spend all of his available time with us.   I wish more husbands were like that.   I am so sorry ladies that you have to go through it. Maybe if you stop taking care of you hubbies and pay more attention to your babies and yourself it will teach them a lesson.   All I know that if my husband was like that I would definitely started thinking more about myself and my baby-girl.   To hell with his diner and laundry - make yours and don't care about him  - after all he does not care about both of you.  The house is not that clean? Hey you have more important thing to do - taking care of the baby is a full-time job. So you'll do it when you are more rested.  As for nights out - even though my husband helps me out  a lot - I do not get to go out - just do not see any point of going out by myself plus I do not think it is fair to my husband who works to leave him alone with the baby.  I hope everything will change for you soon, and your fiance will realize his responsibility (he is the father after all).  Good luck|`|n6XYYyoLaa	sorry hon, i wouldnt want to be with someone some immature and disrespectful and as uncaring about you and your needs, that is very selfish....and he has a baby and he's out hanging with buds til3? nope, not happening here; those days are for when you are single, much less when you have a family....i would kill myhub if he pulled something like that...you need a mature man, who wants to help, not just bc he 'has' to bc it is his night...|`|oIFMohfUaa	He needs to understand that this isn't a sink full of dirty dishes waiting to go into the dishwasher...as in, "But honey, it's your turn to load it..." and it's his baby!  There are no turns!    Helping one another is how it's done!  Maybe he needs to take his turn doing his own chores.  He'll only "let" you baby HIM until you stop letting him take advantage of you!    I was lucky...I've got the ultimate hubby...only after our 1st baby...I stopped babying my hubby...and he realized how much I did!  Now he's supportive and we both "share"...and it's wonderful!    Good luck!|`|UYfqzCoMaa	My husband was the same way with our first baby together. Until I stopped doing his chores for him and just left them for him to do. I quit doing his laundry and I told him straight out "you have the kids tonight cause I am going out". He has since then became a much better hubby. He helps me out around the house and is much more of a hands on dad.|`|3klIx1Egaa	my boyfriend is the same way, and i keep reminding him our child has 2 parents, not one..  Doesnt do any good..    Hes the one not being fair.|`|U7oJrc3faa	Well, my husband doesn't really care about our daughter at all. He trains from 5 am - 1pm every day, and he goes out with his friends and what not when I'm stuck at home taking care of the baby. It's how men are. Get used to it.. ;(|`|gJrHBtp1aa	My husband finally realized how much the kids are taking a toll on me when i finally broke down in tears in front of him. (I never cry in front of him)   After that he has started pitching in more with the kids and the house work.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	wow put your foot down now!! especially if he is not working, there is no excuse for not being home with his family.  if you tolerate it then he will keep doing it, i would tell him right now that, he needs to get his priorities straight or hit the door.|`|fuEXwZydaa	sounds exactly like my ex, lazy and unappreciative.. just tell him straight its either his friends or his child.. he can decide is he chooses u2 and starts to slip again.. freak him out a little.. just come out with evrything u have ever wanted to say to him( in a break down sort of way) and end it with.. well u clearly arnt prepared to be a father and untill u are i dont want you around then move in with your mother for a few days if possible.. then he should be begging 4 u to come back when the house is messy and there isent anything to eat. sorry its just men, show him whos boss.. thats where my problem layed but in the end i kicked him out, the worthless good for nothing. hes gettin better tho now.. so just stay strong.. it WILL work out and if not with this hubby.. then the next! x go tell him girl! x|`|tCnPhIhhaa	Wow....he has it pretty sweet, my partner would never get away with that lol.  I honestly think u are being way 2 nice.   Never tried this b4 & it might b stupid lol, but maybe you could write down for a week everything you do each day & everything he does & at the end of the week you could show him & maybe he'l realise he needs to help more. Or I would do what the other lady sed & stop doing his washing or dont cook a few meals & he should start 2 appreciate you a bit more.  Also if you want him to do a chore give him a choice out of 2 & u do the other 1, that way he thinks that he has chosen & it'l make him feel like he made the decision 2 do something...they always chose the easiest & fastest thing, but hey! atleast it gets them helping a bit
f8CN2qIvaa	Heidi Leigh sounds fine.  My niece's middle name is Leigh, so I guess I'm a little biased.|`|HjtdSH7Taa	ugh noooo...both dem names r horrid...heres wht u shud do fink about wheva or nt dat name wud b gud 4 da child all da way thru its lyf nt just az a child...teens...adult...elder|`|WVqoLROFaa	Heidi Leigh(if prounounced lay) would be adorable for a baby girl!  tdfl|`|yqBNCPWJaa	I think it flows well. Heidi means a noble one and Leigh means a meadow. They are both tranquil names with possible switching around. If your child grows to dislike Heidi, she can always switch to Leigh, which is an outstandingly pretty middle name(:    Congrats! Hope I helped; Good luck!|`|qXq0nmBzaa	I wouldn't rhyme the two names. If you end the first name with the "ee" sound, don't do the the same with the mn.    Try  Heidi Abigail  Heidi Alessa  Heidi Bianca  Heidi Cosette  Heidi Danae  Heidi Genevieve  Heidi Jenae  Heidi Johanna  Heidi Maren  Heidi Margot  Heidi Natalya  Heidi Rebeka  Heidi Roxanne  Heidi Suzanne    Hope these give you some idea.|`|cb9626d7fa143d0ce804d5d769640d45aa	I think Heidi Lynne sounds better.|`|GfM4EPwzaa	I love the names; Jolie and Yasmin.    :)|`|5a0wBlJgaa	heidi litia|`|wVJUnBfLaa	Heidi Leigh is fab  if your havin 2nd thoughts what about  brodie leigh  jodie leigh  lilly ella  tilly  madison  taylor jai :)|`|86oPkfzOaa	Yeah, it's nice. Heidi Leigh. But, still, they end in the same sound, which makes it kind of uncomfortable to say.  Try:  Heidi Rain  Heidi Rose  Heidi Lynn  Heidi Lane  Heidi Jane    Also, the surname matters a lot. And, thinking about it, her initials make HL, which could be a abbreviation for 'hell.'|`|ePim7L2zaa	lovely,i was going to call my daughter heidi but i chose hayley marie instead,i think heidi rose is lovely|`|Ekra9yrhaa	i tihnk leigh should be the first name. heidi is horrid.|`|gB2BPIc7aa	my cousins name is heidi marie...i know that marie is called a "filler" but i think that it sounds very nice together|`|yCyw4RlQaa	I like it|`|BaNrweQ4aa	heidi leigh sounds absolutely adorable :) i don't know why people don't like the name heidi. it sounds really pretty, cute and like a nice person :) it's a good name! leigh is an amazing name for a girl and i love the way it's spelt - i think it's quite adorable to be honest :) together, they fit perfectly :D hope i helped x|`|WfmHoFHbaa	its short for the name Adelhied. i had a friend in secondary school called heidi for short. she was so ashamed of the Adelheid bit.|`|9EdUCTwjaa	ahhh its sooooo cute    Heidi Raine  Heidi Noelle  Heidi Kherington  Heidi Renee
Kf9SoNmoaa	I think it sounds like a cows name when it's hyphenated. XD Try:  Annabelle  Anabelle  Annabel  Anabel  Anna Belle|`|BOJEbnCtaa	I think it should be spelled with AnnaBelle. I love the name|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	I think it's a very cute name.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	A lot prettier and nicer than a lot of the names I've been hearing lately. And it leaves you two nickname options.|`|xLabGD6Maa	I prefer Annabeth.|`|FVFxE6owaa	The name is kind of cute, but I like it spelled Annabelle, Anabelle, or Annabel.  I hate hyphens in names.|`|ZrIl3PwLaa	I think it is beautiful.     Congratulations & Good luck!!!|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	i personal wouldnt use it but its nice my friend has a 6mth old name Annabelle|`|UxG6CkU2aa	I love that name, it is so cute! I personally would do away with the hyphen, but if you like it go for it!|`|xpUyH0psaa	it sounds like a little princess but would prefer the spelling of annabelle more.|`|5rqVTOzmaa	I really like this name, but like it better without the hyphen. I would choose Annabelle, very pretty and unique.|`|yqBNCPWJaa	I don't necessarily like the hyphen.  Go for Anabelle, Anabell, Annabell, Annabelle. There's so much to use. I just think it's easier without the hyphen.  My insight on the name:  Anna or Ana means gracious or graceful, making it gorgeously exceeding.  Bell or Belle or Bella means beautiful, so that just heightens the beauty of the name! (:    Hope I helped. Good luck! (:|`|EtCkoHX5aa	That's a beautiful name!!!|`|yCyw4RlQaa	I like it spelled Anabelle|`|WfmHoFHbaa	its a gorgeous name but a nicer spelling would be Anabel. or Annabelle. no hyphen needed|`|MDTgUDnUaa	I like Anna-Belle with the hyphen. My friend had a little girl a week ago and her fist name is Annabelle without the hyphen. It's beautiful and classy. And I think it suits the old and new name trends both. Classic.|`|tmwa1oOiaa	I don't like it with the hyphon. I like Anabel though. Claribel is a cute name too(;|`|NJU2XWu8aa	spell it properly

Since you are calling YOUR baby "IT"!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|FLpMShKNaa	of course "it" does not hate you. Babies bite anything and everything when they are teething, plus babies just explore their world by putting things in their mouth. If your baby seems to want you and enjoys your company he/she does not hate you.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	troll......"it." psycho!!|`|1Si9RlEXaa	No "it" doesn't hate you. In fact it may be "it's" way of showing a little affection for you.   Baby (or "it") is probable teething and you are making him/her feel better. You can't be too caught up in what your baby does or doesn't do, just wait until they are teenagers. Then you will really wonder.|`|zQAWuMN4aa	I don't understand. Babies aren't an "IT".
uMIvRRjoaa	I didn't get quite as big as you, but I'm now a D cup (went from c to dolly parton ;-), then dd while bfing, and now back to d after a year of not bfing).   And can I say super big kudos for being a bfing teen!! My mom was one as well (18 though when big bro was born). I wish more teen moms would go that way.|`|c76bc0ffbd77bfaaa2937eb65cf4e252aa	I am currently breastfeeding my 5 month old. I was an A cup before having my daughter and now I'm a C cup. I was also only 90 lbs before my pregnancy, and now I'm heavier and healthier looking. I definitely notice that they sag much more. The appearance overall is much different. The areola is bigger, and there are visible veins (which I've heard go away after breastfeeding? Maybe you can answer that one for me.) I've heard from many people that it's the pregnancy that changes your boobs/makes them sag, and breastfeeding isn't the culprit!|`|gJrHBtp1aa	I breastfed my daughter for 4 months and the sagginess did get better over time, my son is officially done breastfeeding (11 months) and they are back to being saggy. I hope they get a little bit better but I have told my husband we are eventually saving up for a breast lift. I'm only 24 and have grandma boobs.|`|Cm7MQrhiaa	Out of all honesty, you most likely will never have the same type of breasts as you did before the birth of your son. You will eventually lose the fat of your breasts but they will probably never be "perky" without surgery.|`|VSadTGgUaa	I was a B cup prior to pregnancy. during pregnancy & breast feeding I went up cup size. I fed for 7-8 months and once my milk dried my breast pretty much returned to their original size. of course they are not as "perkalicious!" lol. but that happens to every mother, breast feeding or not. gravity takes toll on your body. oh the joy of motherhood! : )|`|dc5bTUtmaa	I breastfed 3 children, they are now grown up n' having their own. l'll tell you what l tell them, keep em' well strapped up.

My son is 7 months and I still breastfeed. I really enjoy it and I wish I would have done it with my other two but it was really really hard and EXTREMELY painful at first and i was younger then and didn't really feel like breastfeeding ahha i wanted to drink but anyway i think it's a good idea you are a breastfeeding mom!|`|2A6xFP81aa	try going to www.kellymom.com      you could ask that to hundreds of bf moms|`|Z5r7i6URaa	I breastfeed my daughter for three months due to her being lactose intolerant and me hating soy (i tried for two weeks) she is now bottled feed Special formula. I used cabbage leaves to dry up my milk it works a treat its cheap and Natural.  Just place the leaves in the fridge to chill once chilled place the leaves inside your bra so they completely cover your breast change them once they start to wilt. It took my milk four days to dry up. I start as a 12d, while pregnant and breastfeeding i was a 16d and now i am back to a 12d (Australian size) and yes they sag. By the way i miss feeding her so much if only i was stronger to last on that soy stuff.
Osn1xpu6aa	it's pretty good, i ended up skimming through some of it because it got redundant, but I can definitely relate to many of the stanzas, which is something every writer should strive to have their audience do.

640c4c1f67ea41221d49294d28e598d8aa	I would pack as soon as you can... You never know when you will go into labor and what if you can't pack yourself... sometimes if your so excited you forget what you need... My mothers birthday is on 7/5 and mine is on 7/1    If I could pack my hospital bag over again, here is what I would pack:    CONTENTS: THE "BRING OR PAY THE PRICE" LIST  You should pack the following in your bag:   ? Changes of clothes for you and your husband for up to 4 days. Depending on the hospital, your insurance plan, and the health of mother and child, you may be in the hospital up to 3 days after the baby is born. Considering you can be in labor up to 24 hours, that brings the day count to 4 days. You might be in hospital gowns the whole time but it is better to bring extra clothes just in case. Pack Socks: During labor, and after the delivery, your feet tend to get nice and frosty. Pack socks to help keep them warm.      ? Clothes for your baby is necessary for the trip home. Use common sense: if it is in the middle of winter you will need to bring extra blankets.    ? Toiletries are essential if you want to keep your teeth clean, your pits dry, and your face smooth. Most recovery rooms in the maternity ward have in-room showers. You won"t need towels. Word of advice, be careful not to lean up against the red emergency button in the shower. The last thing you want is a team of nurses busting into the shower (and they will) with you standing there washing.    ? Pillows will be necessary for labor and recovery. Many times, during labor, you will want something to clench to or something to alleviate the back pain. Plus, your husband will want a pillow to sleep with on the pullout cot. Trust me, your head and back will thank me.    ? Lollipops are nice to have because they will keep your mouth hydrated. There"s a lot of huffing and puffing going on and dry mouth will occur. The powers that be advise not to bring hard candy or chewy candy as they might choke on them mid-contraction. So leave the Sugar Daddys at home.    ? Food. You will be hungry during this ordeal. You should pack some snacks for yourself. Avoid especially smelly foods to eat around your wife in labor. You might be hypersensitive to that. (Keep the sardines and beef jerky for later.) I recommend granola bars, crackers, and pretzels.    ? Special pictures and other doodads are sometimes brought in to relax you by surrounding you with familiar items. The success of these items vary. Sometimes this also includes magazines, books, special music, or games.     ? A camera or video camera should definitely be brought with you. Even if it is a cheap disposable one. You WILL want to capture the moments unfolding in front of your eyes. If you bring a digital, make sure you have extra batteries and the recharger. And discuss with your husband beforehand which shots are off-limits. You might not want to be shooting spread eagle shots during the single most painful moment of your life. Or then again, you might want to like I did. Just ask. NOTE: Always gain let your husband know that approval is needed before circulating pictures to family and friends. Pictures taken during labor might yield embarrassing results.     ? Communication is key when the baby is born. You will be talking to people on the phone for the next 48 hours. And this is besides the friends and family that will surround you in the hospital room. Bring your cell phone, the charger, and don"t forget to bring your address book. If you are overambitious distribute a phone chain ahead of time. Call the first person, give them your recovery room phone number and then just wait for the calls to come in. Everyone will find out the news and you will save cell phone minutes. Just make sure you personally call the important people.    ? Don"t forget to bring some cash. In some hospitals, the cafeteria does not except credit cards. Plus, the last thing you want is have your husband walk 6 blocks to get to an ATM from your bank just to buy a Coke and a bag of chips for you. lol     And last... DON'T FORGET    Car seat (the hospital will not let you leave without a car seat, and it being properly installed)|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	if you have a baby book like what to expect when your expecting or the pregnancy bible they tell you what you need to pack for the hospital, the only thing you need for your baby is a coming home outfit because the hospital provides everything else.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	you can set up the diaper bag prehaps after your baby shower.    in your hospital bag you need to pack the essentials for you, etc, toothpaste, toothbrush, deoderant, comfy clothes, ...a camera (disposable) just in case you forget your digital!!!    and stuff for the baby, blankets, outfits...    and also if the doctor/midwife you are seeing requires you to have pre-admission papers filled out and you have to bring them when you go in delivery then pack them as well! that is something you can not forget even though most women give them to they're delivering hospital at the end of their 3rd trimester    good luck|`|xOr67VDiaa	haha you cant tell your really excited already, its cute. you should get a book from the hospital that helps with all that stuff, its a good book to read too, it tells you about the hospital and all that and what you need to bring, these days you need to take everything, the hospital doesnt provided anything anymore. sheesh im 35 weeks and i havent even started backing my stuff lol good luck love you made me smile with your ??|`|AA12275027	as soon as you want.  just make sure the bag is placed in a dry location and covered so it is free from dust...lol.      a diaper bag should contain  diapers   diaper cream  2 changes of clothing    hospital trip  2 pajamas  change for parking  phone cards for cellphone or quarters  phone list  2 outfits for baby (onesie outfits are best because of the cord stump)  change for vending machines|`|dnEmFs2maa	It depends on the trip, but for a short trip of maybe a few hours, I'll pack a travel pack of wipes, bottle of baby powder, paci, bottle (or 2), and 2-4 diapers.  For longer trips increase amount of bottles and diapers, and possibly add a change of clothes.  Now, for the hospital, they should take care of your baby in the nursery or NICU until you are ready to leave.  And, it shouldn't take more than 10 minutes to pack a diaper bag, but, ya know, I'm a guy.  I don't spend time on details like, does this outfit match, or whatever.  So, I'm a slob, but I mainly buy shirts that are about the same color.  I have several brown and black shirts.  Wait, why am I getting into this?  I'd still say 20 minutes tops.|`|jYPeis3Saa	you can do it whenever you want.    when i was pregnant with my son, i packed a comming home outfit, hat, socks, under onesie, blanket, diapres and wipes.|`|LABC73E7aa	i put a t shirt, an outfit, diapers, wipes, a blanket, a hat, some booties, and hospital and peditrician papers in mine. I prob over packed cause they say that the hospital gives u so many things.|`|XIeLK7oPaa	my wife had a bag packed almost the day she found out she was pregnant. so pack whenever it makes you feel comfortable.  make sure to pack things for yourself too, besides the essentials, don't forget some comfort items for yourself from home
deIzFnV8aa	I have read several places that the first 3 months are considered the "fourth trimester", where you really can't spoil a baby or teach her bad habits. However, 3 months is when many sites suggest you start encouraging "good habits", such as bedtime routines, not being fed to sleep, etc. I have also heard 3 months cited as that age at which babies begin "intentional crying" -  they can cry  because they are confused or upset about something in addition to wanting a basic need met.  I would say that your daughter is old enough to make the connection that you will pick her up when she cries, but it is quite likely that she is either used to being held or it helps gas pain or whatever.  What I'm trying to say is, I think she is old enough to make the connection, but not old enough to really trying to be manipulatiing you for her own purposes :P|`|n6XYYyoLaa	save your arms and get a carrier; she's probably too young to understand anything other than she 'needs' momma; so i would hold her for now; my gal has always been happy in her baby bjorn, even sleeps in it if she gets tired, and now she's seven mos, so it must be pretty comfy; i never felt secure with the slings, but a lot of ppl like those too...|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I guess I'm not sure.  To me, my 7 month old isn't manipulating me when he cries to be held, or attempts to charm me into not putting him down for a nap by doing all of his latest "tricks."  He's just trying to express what it is that he wants, and then get me to do it, whether by crying his need, or attempting to please me.  Manipulation, in my mind, requires deceit.  He would need to be pretending something, because he knows it will affect me, in order to get me to do something I would otherwise be disinclined to do.  I'm not sure when he'll get to that point, but I think it'll be a while.|`|Gdy6LSLeaa	i cant stand it when people say "your spoiling your bayb by holding them". hold her while you can, cuz she will be walking before you know it. try putting her in a walker or an exersaucer and take it to the room you need to pick up. just talk to her while cleaning and even play peek-a-boo around walls and door ways. once she starts to crawl it will be easier.|`|QVC6sxtJaa	maybe 5 months|`|UYfqzCoMaa	I feel ya.

O20eJDd4aa	Return theirs to them and stop using one, you don't really need it! Make a habit of 'emptying' the contents of dirty nappies in the loo before you bin them, it helps with the smells and it's better for the environment, a less dirty nappy is less polluting on the landfill.|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	i would just return theirs and not get another. you can always use plastic grocery bags to put your diapers in and put them outside until they can be taken to the trash(assuming they are stinky ones) otherwise you can just put them in the garbage. to be honest the diaper genie doesnt work that well once you start baby on solid foods. it really still smells and since your baby is at least a couple of months old it probably wont be that long until you wouldnt want to use it anyway. or the other option is to look in a second hand baby shop.

qXq0nmBzaa	...as in Dan'l Boone or the character in "LOST"?    It sounds like a family name and those consistently work best as a middle name.

o7bYWjy7aa	i was offered stool softeners when in hospital by the midwifes so i would say its fine to take|`|IXBl5l5kaa	Stool softeners are a Godsend when you get out of the hospital. Definitely helps reduce the amount of strain when having a BM.    I still take them from time to time! (I've always been not-so-regular)|`|zcYl3ftTaa	Yes my wife couldn't do without them after the birth of all of our children.|`|OLAtwLV6aa	yes its safe i took them after the baby was born and i breastfed|`|EmYNUZcXaa	yes. i was prescribed the exact same stool softener. its completely fine to take.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I was breastfeeding in the hosp and they gave me ducolax..  when I left to go home they said stool softeners were fine.    Also while you are passing a stool.. try using a pad or some toilet paper and apply pressure to your vaginal area while you are going..  seems to help somewhat.|`|3bf411fb0977582b031f408308f1234baa	When I left the hospital with my exclusively breast fed son, my doctor told me to take Colace for as long as I needed to.  Not sure of the main ingredient but its available over the counter.  If my doctor sent me home with it, then it should be safe for nursing mom's.  Does you health plan have a nurses hotline that you can call?  Some do.  Happy breast feeding!  You are giving your baby the best start in life!|`|ZzuYwxukaa	Stool softeners was part of my meds after my c-section while I was in the hospital. I was also breastfeeding so it's definitly ok.|`|qy43hR40aa	Yes...it is safe. I sometimes can't go for 6 or 7 days and taking this definitely helps.  I would stay away from the ones with stimulants (Magnesium Citrate..milk of magnesia..) because they have alot of sodium in it.  It was a real discomfort for me to take those while I was preggers because my feet would get so sore and swollen.  It won't hurt the baby, but its just uncomfortable for mommy.  Anything that is ducosate sodium is completely safe...my doctor recommended a different brand of that.  It was called Colace.  Just make sure to take lots of water with it or you'll be back where you started!    Good luck!|`|OSZ1AIznaa	If you are worried about the effects of a stool softener- try Miralax.  My pediatrician told me it is safe enough that he has prescribed it for toddlers who are constipated.  You just mix it in with water or juice.  It worked for me.

BOJEbnCtaa	Your hubby actually likes the name Beatrix??? yuck. I really like Rainy an Elle. You have great boys names.|`|EtCkoHX5aa	I'm not a huge fan of Rainy or Violet. But, I think Elle is beautiful. So is Ella. Good luck on your first daughter!|`|xpUyH0psaa	i like elle, but ella will be better so that the other boys won't feel left out that 2 kids have the first same letter. ella will have at least ever kid sharing the letter A.|`|fboC1N7gaa	Elle|`|doLyOac0aa	Ella,|`|5rqVTOzmaa	I would choose Violet out of these names. I don't really like Elle, maybe Ella? I also don't like Rainy, sorry.|`|NJU2XWu8aa	Beatrix is a hideous name. Beatrice is slightly better.     Rainy, Violet and Elle are all beautiful. Good luck!|`|DP48dIxhaa	Elle is the best out of the three....but honestly I don't care for any of them. And Ava and Beatrix aren't too great either. I'm sorry.|`|2EcyWp2baa	Violet!|`|igvUbqkyaa	Elle or Ava.|`|yCyw4RlQaa	Fave is Rainy   Hate Violet  I like Ella better then Elle|`|qXq0nmBzaa	With the exception of Aiden, you have chosen classic names so I think the girl's name should be in the same vein. Beatrix would have been absolutely lovely.    However, your choices of classic names are Violet and Elle (Rainy is a weather report, not a name and certainly not a classic).     I like Elle but, depending on the middle and surnames, could be choppy sounding. Ella would be a much prettier choice and would really fit with the rest of the names.    Barring that, then go with Violet (although I can only think of Willy Wonka every time I hear the name!).    Best of luck whatever you decide to do.|`|xqPRS6Buaa	Elle would be good, if you pronounced it like the letter L, but I think if you say it El-e, its too common to fit in with the names of your other children|`|n2N1e8dxaa	Elle!!  all the way|`|zyaOgSfqaa	First of all, I love all of the boys names sooo much!  I am not a huge fan of Rainy, but I do like just Raine or Rayne.  I love Violet a lot. Elle is cute too, but I like Violet better.  It sounds like it would suit an adult better than Elle would.  Maybe you could try Violet Raine, I think that sounds beautiful!  Congrats on your first daughter by the way.   :))|`|d86b2f03db6baf10abae1a77da9c0cb8aa	Elle.|`|mm3Bqarjaa	Violet seems preety but Elle is very unique..|`|sngEejAVaa	I really dont know which name would be best for your precious one, but I just want to give a little advice... Think of your child growing up... Will she get picked on because of her name?  It will hurt you if that little darling comes home crying because people are picking on her name.. None of us chose our names, but now a days - the parents need to make the right decision and think about more than what they want as a name.... What will that name mean, can anyone take that name and make harsh things come from it?  Sorry,, Just some advise..|`|TE7foNwMaa	Well, I don't think Ava is too popular to fit in with your sons' names... as you probably know, they are quite popular right now too. Actually, Aidan, Ethan, and Noah are the top 3 boys' names. And Caleb is number 5. So I personally love Ava... I think she would fit in perfectly! I don't mean to be rude by telling you that the names are "overused" or something, because they're definitely not. There's a reason they're popular...and that would be just because they're amazingly charming and sweet.     I also think Beatrix is a bit too strange to fit in with your boys' names. I'd say it's more ancient and classic...slightly different from the sweet, classy names of your sons. It's not hideous, but it wouldn't seem to fit in as well as some of the other options.    As for the other names...  Rainy -- It's not really my style. All of your sons' names are so classy, Rainy just doesn't seem to fit in... She seems slightly more unique and different compared to Ethan, Noah, Caleb, and Aidan.     Violet -- This is probably my favorite. It's gorgeous, and fits in nicely with the boys. It's also nice and girly, and it fits amazingly well seeing as she's your only girl at the moment. I love it. :)    Elle -- It seems a bit too much like a nickname to me. Like it's a bit less complete. Maybe if it was a nickname for something ending in "elle"... But it still seems a little "odd girl out" to me.     So, my favorites are Ava and Violet. Though I do agree with your husband...that Ava is extremely popular... but if there's a name you love, you should never let popularity get in the way. This might be the only chance you get to use it, after all. And she can easily be unique all on her own, without needing a less popular name.   But, of course, you want to also agree on the name. So for that reason, I would pick Violet. She fits in with the classy set of boys perfectly. :)    -- Amy|`|1SDlh621aa	What about Avery (Avary)?  Call her Ava for short.    Violet is very pretty.    Beatrix is awful, lol.|`|FLOjzbKEaa	Elle
2c34f694bb2db719dd7d5fea97358269aa	yes, my boy is almost 3 years and in less than a year after his birth it was gone, i am pregnant now and its going to be a c-section again and my doc was making fun, because he said he lost the old scar, lol
mtmMQH4Xaa	Ha ha ha!   9 months later,, honest, I'm a virgin, but I did once finger myself.|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	Yes|`|gILygKvRaa	no. because once the sperm comes out, unless the tab is in the slot the sperm comes out and is dead.|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	It is possible. Probably not very likely but it still could happen.|`|jLYuqk1Jaa	yea u can get pregnant and trust me u dont want that but yea like i said its possible|`|3HWV0AkKaa	if the SPERM is dry then no.|`|sngEejAVaa	I believe that once sperm hits the air, it dies...|`|yp4Rtxjaaa	For the most part, it dies when it reaches the air, yet it is still likely.|`|39f0517ef76cfb6cf02c7bee6fa47a66aa	some people believe that once semen is dried, the sperm cannot swim up to the fallopian tubes and meet the egg and thus being conception. it is NOT true. sperm lives for THREE days, regardless of being dried or "hitting air" like some ppl on here have already said.     this is why, if you fool around with a boy, and clothes come off and juices come out... one should have spermicide. its always safer.  and would be good if there was a heat of the moment and sex started,,, but no condom... hmm that could lead to pregnancy... we DON"T  want that. but still spermicide is not enough. Birth Control on both sides (boy and girl) is the best way to stay safe if you decide to become sexually active....    and yes... even if you don't have sex, you can get pregnant, it happened to my mom.|`|vRpc3Bk4aa	why would u ever do that?!  yes it's possible!
6yYeCVQFaa	I am 11 weeks pregnant and I take it you would like to be pregnant? Early pregnancy symptoms tend to mock PMS symptoms which is why it is so difficult to detect without a missed period and a positive pregnancy test. I had severe cramps when I first got pregnant that felt as if I was going to start my period but I have never had an infection downstairs and have no idea whether cramps are normal with an infection. My appetite didn't pick up until this week and I seemed to be eating smaller amounts when I got pregnant because morning sickness kills your appetite. The thought of food made me throw up. If you had been taking the pill it's rare that you can get pregnant but not completely impossible. Either way, you need to take a test. Even though it seems like a waste of money it's still important to know whether you are pregnant or not because you need to be taking prenatal vitamins and minding what you eat. Best of luck to you!|`|0iuvUhMpaa	if you can i would just wait, those results usually dont take long to come back, never no they could come back saying that there is a little bubba in there ;)  Good luck hunnie i hope it isnt anything serious!
2dl3H2Ikaa	Please don't ignore your babies cries - no matter how old they are.  That is their only signal to tell you that something is wrong and if you ignore it then all it does is teach them that when they need you, you don't come!!  There is some good scientific evidence that leaving them to cry can be harmful. This evidence is available in the book, The Baby Sleep Book by Dr Sears.  There is a very good book written by Elizabeth Pantley called "the no cry sleep solution" which is gentle ways to help your baby sleep through and helps you recognise what the problem is.    My daughter has just turned  two and has slept through the night about 5 times at the most.  We had loads of advice, including the "cry it out" scenario which we thankfully ignored as it turned out my daughter is allergic to cow's milk and has a number of other food allergies.  Whilst we seemed to have worked through the food she can/can't have, she still suffers terribly from trapped wind and can be up crying a number of times through the night.  At times she is sobbing.  It is exhausting and I can fully empathise with you.      What about having a look at what she is doing in the evenings, does she eat dinner late or have snacks that could cause heartburn or indigestion?  Is she waking up in a dark room and maybe scared?  Does she go back to sleep ok when you go to her?  Please take comfort from knowing you are not the only one with sleep depravation lol!!  Hope some of this helps.|`|UX3xjsFlaa	I hate to tell you this but you have to let her cry it out. I had to do that with both my children, now 2 1/2 and 6 years old. I would literally sit outside their doors weeping because they were screaming and crying but its the only way they learn to fall asleep on their own. A few questions..  Has your daugther recently given up a paci or favorite blankie?  Any major changes in your household/everyday lives she may be aware of?  A switch to a new bed?  Scary shows on TV?  Let me know if I can help!!|`|jL8RbY1Uaa	My now 3 year old daughter has been crying in the night ever since she turned 18 months or so. We thought it must be dreams. But, after 2 1/2 years, she started verbalising why she cries "Mommy ! It's paining in my legs". We are trying to figure it out with the Doctor now".    Please take a blood test for all nutrients, and start from there.    And yeah!! Mine cries every night too!    Good luck!
WXExyAlWaa	While you can get pregnant without penetrative sex, the chances are very slim, and it normally happens when he comes and the semen land around the female genital area. Getting pregnant from being in a hot tub that has semen floating around with it would be extremely unlikely.|`|D0edZCPQaa	Chances are extremely slim for all of those questions.  You cannot get pregnant unles you have unprotected penetraitive sexual intercourse.|`|6avKnzkoaa	Sperm dies in water. Though just to be safe (on my part) there is always a chance.     However, if you have sexual intercourse in a hot tub, you can still get pregnant.     Pre-***, there is a chance, if through sexual intercourse and not through water.|`|AA10241709	1.) No... well, very unlikely    2.) No... well, very unlikely    3.) Though it's not common, if he doesn't come any where around her vagina, she will be fine.  If it goes anywhere in or even near, your chances go up a great deal!  JUST DON'T DO IT.    4.) Yes    You might not get pregnant from most of these, but you very well can get diseases.  I suggest skipping the skinny dipping party if all of this is going on.|`|NI8D46J0aa	You have to have penetration in order to get pregnant.

Kinda weird! And so not sexy! This sounds more like an orgy to me.....
v9rzGYWoaa	This woman clearly has psychological problems. Just like that Damn Dugger couple with 20 kids! No normal person would do this to their bodies or there children. I have one child I want one more. I wont have it because I cant afford it. You have to use your brains people. She obviously had plugged up tubes for a reason, Someone obviously didn't want her havin babies!       Where is she getting the money to do this?  I went to a clinic and talked to a dr about trying for one more. The cost for 3 attempts at fertilization is $16,000 plus $5100 for medication or 21,100.  Then the cost of the sperm.    Donor sperm from anonymous donors     Intracervical Insemination (ICI)  Unwashed sperm MOT20 straw, 8-11 million motile sperm after thawing  $300 -one vial    Donor sperm from open identity donors     Intracervical Insemination (ICI)  Unwashed sperm MOT20 straw, 8-11 million motile sperm after thawing  $400 -one vial      It takes more than one vial, it takes between two and three vials ,for one time.|`|FLOjzbKEaa	OMG, still you guys talking about this story.|`|iMULlxdgaa	yeah I know this story was talked about but your right---its creepy really.  She has 6 kids and she's like 35 years old now right?  Her kids are fairly young too the oldest is like 7?  Anyway---she had this IVF...but why?  I could understand if she never had any kids...but she had 6 already.  (her family is broke too)  I thinkn there should be a law aganist broke people getting IVF. No offense to anyone who may disagree and say "everyone has the right to push out as mnay babies...blah blah"  No you don't!  No you effing don'ty have the right to push out that many kids with no income!  And the scary part is this didn't even HAVE TO happen!!!!  They  PUT 8 embryos in her!  Not that this happened naturally!  If it would have been natural than ok I could understand its not her fault...but having the option I WOULD NOT HAVE MORE KIDS IF I WAS BROKE! ESPECIALLY NOT 8 MORE KIDS!|`|dSuZ5x1Saa	I think she's selfish. She has no income, no husband, no house, nothing.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	she went bankrupt last year too, yes CPS should get involved, she is not thinking about her kids only herself and what she wants|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	I hate to judge.. but the facts that keep coming up are very incriminating...no father, living with parents, mom thinks she's nuts and wants nothing to do with her...there is obviously something not right in this woman's head and I do not think she should get support....and if she does they should also force her to work for her kids that she decided to have.|`|qRlPRJ1Jaa	Not only was this woman irresponsible, so was the idiot doctor that implanted the embryos. She already has 6 kids, no job and no husband. Why would any doctor think she was a good candidate for invitro fertilization? These poor kids will have problems due to low birth weights and just who will take care of them. Her mother said she is not going to help. 8 babies crying, having to be fed and bathed and changed, plus 6 other kids to take care of, seems an impossible task for 1 person. I think CPS should definately get involved.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	She is crazy, how did she pay for the treatments.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	her husband is in the military in iraq    why would i get a thumbs down for saying that.. she does have a husband in iraq which means that the military is giving them a fat paycheck.. who cares if she lives with her mom, some families are really close. maybe her mom lives with her.. she had a choice! she wouldnt have had 8 more kids if she couldnt take care of them|`|mPTBU0QDaa	She might live with her parents by choice, because they both want it, and not out of necessity. I haven't heard anything about her financial situation.    I agree 100% that she should be married before having kids, because children need a positive role-model mother AND a father in order to develop properly. I don't know why she would want 14 kids with no dad.    I don't believe that the other 6 kids are random. They are HER kids. I'm sure she loves them.    I mean, personally, I see nothing wrong with having a large family, whether naturally or not. I see nothing wrong with living with one's parents. I do have a problem with no dad around, and I would have a problem if the children were neglected, but I haven't heard that they are.    As far as receiving assistance from the government, a lot of families with 1 child receive assistance and really don't even need it. I teach 12 kids every day in preschool who qualify for government money to be in preschool. Their parents neither have to have jobs nor be in school in order to receive this aid. Basically, they can sit at home doing nothing while I pay for their kids to go to school, and really don't make that much at my own job! So, having a lot of kids and being on government assistance really isn't any worse than 14 families each having 1 kid and being on government assistance.    CPS should only get involved if the kids are being neglected. Living in a small house or with grandparents doesn't mean they aren't being raised properly. I know a lot of children whose parents are very rich, who are only children or have 1 other sibling, who are SO neglected, even though they live in a huge house, have awesome clothes, millions of toys, etc.|`|alJA3jyCaa	Yes, I hope that CPS will look into if she can provide enough space, time, Energy, and is sane or not.  I read that if she is on assistance it will cost taxpayers 3.5 million.  The tax refunds for Californians should go on permit hold(not really).|`|DuLhv7Ajaa	It not being sarcastic, but I think this woman has a mental disorder. There is a real disorder that is recognized by psychiatrists, where the patients feel the need to horde great numbers of pets. I really think she has something like this only her need is to horde children.|`|fUtLCFt0aa	ALTHOUGH i agree with you ..... everyone makes their decisions... i am married HAPPILY and pregnant with my 2nd .... you think that because we have obama as a president  things might change for the better but they wont ... i believe things will get worse... it will be easier for woman like that to get help from tax payers to support these children.... haveing so many... but you know whats even more interesting the fact that we the people who talk about this situation are giving her also credibilaty and making it the NEWS and she gets money for the info....... so we are giving it the time of day... SAD ISNT IT???
xpUyH0psaa	i think that naming a child as a junior is just too confusing and is not that original. it can be seen that the parents really love the child and want it to be after a parent, but the child may feel that he/she doesn't have his/her own identity. it makes him/her feel like he/she have to follow his/her mom and dad footsteps. there will be too much pressure because there will always be someone the child is refer too.    it will be better to use the mom or dad first name as the baby's middle name.|`|Jswomud7aa	My father and brother both are named Robert, but have different middle names. My brother got into debt and creditors were coming after my dad because of the name confusion!    In this day and age having a Sr. and Jr. can be tricky, but not impossible. Maybe if you just consistently use the middle initial or full middle name in all important documents, it will keep the separation between the two.    I named both my kids after my husband's parents. If I have any more I will name them after my parents (My husband is Greek... it's traditional). I think it's a great way to really honor your parents.     My daughter's name is Vasiliki (grandmother's name) Sofia, and we call her Sofia. So anything can work!    Good luck!    |`|72SrLDQ3aa	Both of my girls are named after someone. My oldest has the same initials as her dad & grandpa, and she has the same middle name as her dad, only spelled differently. My youngest has my mom's name for her middle name.    We also have our future children's names picked out, and they all have middle names from family members.|`|QWTLw9DEaa	I think that, sometimes, naming a child after yourself  makes it seem like the parents are a little egotistical or uncreative. I mean, I understand if it's a family thing, but if you have another boy and one boy is already named after you... I dunno, they may feel less important.  I'd use it as a middle name instead|`|gxqawyxUaa	I'm okay with it, I don't sway one way or another but I don't think I'd ever name my son as a junior, I just don't like that idea (multiple reasons).    I'd skip naming him a junior since the whole two doctor thing would cause confusion. It'd be okay to name the child after the uncles, I suppose. Be sure to think about holidays- will there be two people hollering "What!?" at family get-togethers when someone says one name?    Think about different incidences and go from there :)|`|IjcdwJiMaa	my ex (raymond) has the same name as his dad, his grandpa, & great grandpa, he wanted 2 name our son that name also,but i said no cz i thought that 4 was enough as it was lol, but i did however put his name in the middle name, & let him help me pick a name that he liked with me, so my son is ryley raymond james, (also named after my dad), lol not everybody loves raymond it seems lol (the tv show)|`|EtCkoHX5aa	If you are going to name him after you, I wouldn't go with Jr. Just give him the same name as you, except the junior. Junior just sounds kind of little kiddish, and he wouldn't want that as an adult.    Maybe name him after a grandparent?|`|cn91FeWcaa	you can name ur child after urself without naming him benjamin...his name could be ben, benard, benson, or something|`|MDTgUDnUaa	I think it's fine to name a child after family or yourself. I think it's fitting to name a child after a family member if that family member has a special relationship with you or you're wanted to honor somebody by using their name or middle name.    I have a brother and a sister (out of the 5 of us) that are named after my dad and my mom. And one sister has a combo middle name, Jodell, after my 2 grandma's... Joan and Idell. We call her Jodi and it works!    I don't necessarily agree with naming a child after yourself or a family member solely for tradition unless you truly like the name. In those cases I'd recommend finding a similar name and giving them a new identity.    And if you're a great doctor, I think people will find it nice to know two docs by the same name and hope that your son would be as wonderful at it as you.|`|gB2BPIc7aa	it really depends on how you feel about it...my boyfriend is a III and is very proud of it, he like the family name and the association with his dad and grandpa...so it really depends on how you feel, i would go with a II rather than a jr., jr sounds young and will always sound young no matter how old he gets.. but naming your son after you or your brothers is really up to and just because you name them after someone doesnt even mean you have to include the junior or any other suffix..its all up to you and what you want for your child|`|tmwa1oOiaa	I think naming your child after someone else is fine, as long as it's not you(: Like the 1st answerer said, it's a bit egotistical, & in my opinion a little wierd. I would hate having 'the 2nd' or 'the 3rd' tacked onto my first name.     My whole name though is after other people. My first name is my grandfathers mothers name, and my middle name is my grandmothers mother's name. I think it's sweet they named me after them(:  But your brother is a bit too close to have your son named after, imo. I wouldn't want my aunt having the same name as me, and being named after her. But maybe I'm baised. I think if you're naming your child after other family members it shouldn't be immediate family.  And no children named after famous people please, that is just tacky.    But if you're intent on naming your son after you, at least spell it differently. Like Benjimin or Benjamen. Or put it as their middle name.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	use ur name has the middle name, i believe children should have their own first name different from family members.    i named my son a different name even tho his dad, granddad, and great granddad all have the same name. so i used it as my sons middle name|`|yCyw4RlQaa	I think it is really up to the person personally i like the idea of naming your child after someone you love or to remember or honor someone it really is up to you you can pass on your name without the middle name and make another one it can be whatever you want good luck! hope i helped
54cf275d0238f8dd4d90351c9a055b00aa	Relax dont worry that is a normal pregnancy symptom. There is nothing you can do about it. It the hormones and increased blood volume.|`|Om1yADWRaa	Personally this didn't happen to me but i think it is most likely to be the baby just putting a bit of pressure on the lower parts making them slightly swollen if they do start to hurt burn or itch definitely go to the doctor but its most likely not something to do with the babies health.|`|0nb1rQhnaa	Jenny McCarthy talks about it in her book "Belly Laughs" in the chapter titled "The Blue Twinkies" (Your enlarged Vagina).

Good luck, oh, and FYI-nothing ever goes back to normal afterwards.....|`|TVC3mAP7aa	Yep, as others said, it's completely normal.  The increased blood flow from baby makes everything swell up down there.  Things will go back to normal after baby comes.

It will go away. It's just the increased blood volume that your body has to deal with and the baby pushing on certain arteries and veins making circulation a little more difficult. It will go down after a couple of days. It only happened to me once. Try to lay down and rest a little more, put your feet up as they too will swell.|`|FLOjzbKEaa	no dont worry and what makes you look down there checking that think ......if it dosent hurt.. whats the problem then how it looks.    Again dont worry you are ok
AA10624857	The milk is probably going to be fine, since it is pausterized, but I'd get rid of the eggs.  Fresh eggs can stay out of refrigeration for a long time, but if the eggs have been cooled than they need to stay cooled.  The milk may spoil before it's expiration date, but spoiled milk won't hurt you.  You may have an upset stomach, but it won't cause food poisoning.  I'd be on the safe side and get rid of the eggs.|`|Gdy6LSLeaa	anything left out over 40 degrees for more that 4 hours is no good but i would be iffy on the dairy. worse comes to worse, a few extra dollars spent on new is better then getting sick!!!!|`|dc5bTUtmaa	The eggs will be ok n' you just have to smell the milk.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	no its not!! throw them out and always remember..."When in doubt...throw it out."    EDIT: if milk is not stored properly below 40 degrees bacteria will form and grow and you can get really sick. Same goes for eggs.|`|JP2h62qiaa	yeah. Eggs are layed out side. As long as the milk isn't warm. You are fine. My mom has done it plenty of times and I argued her craziness and I didn't get sick from the food.

AA10624857	Legally, once a child turns 18, the parents typically don't make decisions for them. However, if the child still lives with the parents, there are certain things a parent can insist on. Things such as being home at a certain time, not smoking in the house or on the property, getting a job, cleaning up after yourself, etc. If the 18 year old lives at home, he/she should expect to follow the parents' rules. If the 18 year old doesn't like the rules, then legally, they can move out.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	when a child turns 18 they are an adult and the parent may choose to still have rules and expectations if the teen lives with them or may choose to let them be the adult they are. Some 18 year olds are still in high school though...my dad had certain rules for me but it was more or less like a mutual respect type deal...just tell him where I'd be and when I'd be home and in turn I had a lot of freedom. When requested to be home by 1 AM (once I graduated) I obliged and always let hm know if I'd be later dur to going to a late movie or whatever. As long as he knew then he was pretty okay with it. (and he wanted me back at 1 AM because of the bars letting out and drunk drivers being out on the road not because he didn't trust me...and I respected that.)    As for any decisions I wanted to make.. it was all on me. I could get credit cards (and  got one right before college for emergencies) and make my own medical decisions.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	not legal decisions but if you live on their property then they certainly can set rules for thier home that you have to follow no matter what age.     if you are 18 and do not live with them they have no ruling over you at all.|`|IjcdwJiMaa	not unless they r mentally unable 2 make the choice them self, but if they r 18 & of the right mind then they r responsible 4 them self|`|bfb230dc1ac989ed2a0e37264327e8a1aa	Legally at 18 the kids can do almost anything, but rent cars, own property (I believe), buy alcohol, etc.  But for signing contracts and, in the eyes of the law, committing a crime, they are an adult.      However, if there is no spouse involved, the parents can still have a say in their medical care if they are not in a position of make decisions for themselves.
Jswomud7aa	Do you mean dental fillings?    My husband is a dentist and we own our own office, so I have some expertise in this area.    Your fillings could be high. Even the tiniest fraction of difference in the height of your tooth can hurt! It's hard for the dentist to adjust the filling while you are numb because you can't feel your tooth completely. Call your dentist and let him know, if they are high it will take less than 5 minutes to adjust them.    The cavity you had might have been really large and close to the nerve of your tooth. If this is the case then most likely you will need a root canal.    More than likely your fillings just need to be adjusted a little. It's really common for patients to leave the dentist not knowing that the fillings are a little off due to being numb.    good luck w/ your pregnancy too |`|eAxQxkA2aa	Why is this in the pregnancy category?
AA11763588	Geez...    OK, before you want to have sex, learn how your body works.    You ovulate 10 - 14 days from the day you START your period. Sperm can hang out and wait for an egg for 72 hours.    In the future wrap it up or start using birth control if you don't want babies.|`|PlmT4lHXaa	haha, "nutted".. i cant think of a cruder way to describe that...    its possible, probably not. sometimes you can be preggo and have your period but i dont think that usually happens.     You should get condoms for your bf.

KNxs4PrZaa	my daughter is 22 months and still has her binky (we are about to have a baby and i was affraid she would need a security comfort item to help with the changes at home) we have a rule though that she has to leave it in her bed in the morning adn after nap.  i noticed the same as you that she wasnt talking as much because of it so its only for sleeping times not.   but my plan was to try the cut the tip off method.  It worked well for a friend of mine with both her kids.  you just take all of her binks and cut the tips off then slowly cut more adn more off ever few days , it will lose suction and be flat in her mouth and she will not like the feel of it and will soon stop asking for it so much then you can just ditch it altogether.  good luck.|`|f50f6a665c054d5ffd525f5a31663073aa	binky??? is tat a dummy (what they suck on) if so, what i did was made it for bed only. when she gets up just say put binky on bed..show her first and then let her do it. and walk out the room. play with her so she forgets about it. but for the first couple of weeks if she gets very upset give to to her to calm her then put it back on her bed,    i take mine in the car when we go out to just in case my son needs it too|`|uj1A73ZGaa	My daughter was 25months old when she gave up her pacifer. I started at about 20months of only letting her have it at nap time and bed time and she did good with that so than it was only at bed time and than it was gone.     She did good with it. but beware that she might find other things to be her comfort thing. My daughter went from being a thumb sucker when she was a baby and we tried giving her a pacifier to try to stop the thumb sucking and she did both.    So now she sucks her thumb still.     Good luck|`|9ufltMBtaa	put the binkey in a plastic bag and put it under her pillow. Tell her she's a big girl now and the binkey fairy is going to come while she's sleeping, leave her a big girl prize, and bring the binkey to a baby who needs it. Take the binkey while she's sleeping from under her pillow, throw it out and leave her a prize. Make sure to talk about of what a big girl she is now that she gave her binkey to the binkey fairy. She may cry for the first few days without it but don't go out and buy her new binkeys. As pain full as it will be the first day watching her cry,  going out and buying her a new binkey will only hurt her. This always works like a charm. Good luck!|`|GisCtMqQaa	i had a lot of problems getting my son off of his and i would tell him that if he was a big boy (like he kept telling me he was) that he had to give me his binky because big boys don't suck on binkys.   I would limit her use to bedtime and naptime and then just start reducing it from then on. Example being like changing over from bottle to sippy cup, reduce gradually the amount of time she's aloud to have it, it could be a pain but it will be well worth it      Good luck!|`|r2zdEfAcaa	Make it only for bedtime. Also, try cutting the tip off. My mom cut the tip off of mine and my sisters and we both threw them away on our own because we didn't like it anymore like that. Making it only for bed works really well because then she doesn't have it when she needs to be eating or you're teaching her new words. Also, she's awake more than she's asleep anyway. And if she really pitches a fit for it during the day, you can give it to her, but put her in the bed with it so she see's that the binky means bedtime.|`|4692b6697395d1251f260c0920a151baaa	The ideas of putting the bink to bed and only using it at nap or night time are great for transitioning off of it completely. A trick that I picked up and has worked for me and 3 of my friends that I suggested it to was to explain how binkies are for babies and how your daughter is getting to be a big girl (not to mention big sister). You then put the binkies in a package so you can "send" them together to little babies who need them. Your little one should like the idea of doing something that is a special big kid project and since you aren't just throwing them away it is usually less traumatic. I would maybe keep one just in case and be sure not to make it about the fact that new baby is on the way to reduce resentment. Good luck!|`|72SrLDQ3aa	Throw them all away|`|ppE0GtkIaa	I did this with my kids and you can tell her that there are babies at the hospital who need a binky and buy a brown envelope, some stickers, crayons and let her decorate the envelope and take her to the mailbox and let her put it inside, close it and walk away but YOU need to buy a little something for her like a brand new sippy cup or something small that will fit in your mailbox and the next day take her to the mailbox and be excited, happy and tell her the baby fairy came by and sent you something special for giving up your binky for the new babies at the hospital. She will smile and might ask you some questions about her binky and the babies.  She will probably cry but whatever you do, don't go out and buy her another one. It will be hard for a couple of days but she will be fine. My daughter still gives her stuff up and wants to donate her old toys and her somewhat good condition blankets to the childrens ward at the hospital or to a donation center and she is 6 yrs old. She is a very giving child and proud of her. :o)

Ipyapngdaa	Its hard to tell but yeah heres some old sayings, no one can really prove if they are true or not but herre goes;    Some say that if you look at the fetal heart rate that you can predict the gender of your baby. The old saying is that above 140 is a girl and below is a boy.     If the hair on your legs grows faster during pregnancy it's a boy; if it grows slower, it's a girl.     If you crave sour or salty foods, it's a boy; sweets, it's a girl.     &&; if you want to know the gender, why did you tell the doctor you didnt want to knoww?|`|mx3gFmIKaa	With that high of a heartrate the medical profession guesses a girl.|`|lGSUToFQaa	with each of my pregnancies i carried high had a boy and a girl so i don't know, good luck though|`|2EcyWp2baa	my guess is boy.|`|euUZZcM3aa	Well, there's no good way to say which unless you look at an ultrasound.

If you don't want to know, why are you asking?|`|a0h7SLMRaa	This belief is based on the fact that women usually have higher metabolic rates than men and, therefore, have a slightly higher pulse rate. There is no correlation between fetal heart rate and gender -- and it has been studied. This is an "old wives tale" that will not die.   Having said that, it is fun to try to guess gender based on heart rate, and because we have no other ways of doing this (short of amniocentesis and ultrasound), it is harmless enough.   As gestation advances and your baby's neurological system matures, the heart rate will slow a bit. So, it looks like we all start out female.|`|c8WPYjU3aa	girl

CptGRMSlaa	It sounds like you don't trust her.  If that is the case, then why would you possibly be having sex with her?

Take care and be sure not to get dehydrated... thats really important!!|`|iMULlxdgaa	Ok , its the first trimester ...remember it'll suck but the second one will be bettter. I swear mother nature did this **** on purpose so we would get tricked into having more babies...we just forget how much it sucked the first time!  Hang in there!  I'm feeling like crap too right now.|`|eeyGYRcPaa	i'm stressed out too! my mother in law constantly bitches about everything, threatens to have my baby taken away from me because she thinks i'm ruining her sons life, etc...my husband works constantly and is always stressed out so he's cranky towards me. i have no job. my husband works at pizza hut even though he has a college degree he refuses to use...we can barely afford our apartment and our bills! he promises to get a better job but never does...and the list goes on and on and on! you can talk to me if you want hun! sometimes it just helps to talk. i don't have yahoo messanger cause i'm weird but i have aim: checkercrazed96 feel free to message me anytime!|`|HfZeQR4Aaa	I feel for you  and I hope you feel better. You should be able to call your doctor's office this weekend. They should have a dr on call that can help you. Are you spotting or puking?     Sometimes, cramping is normal. You feel like you're about to have your period but you don't. Are you taking prenatal vitamins? If not you may be lacking nutrients or gestational diabetes. I hope it's not serious or diabetes at all.     Prenatal vitamins can make you sick too. You may have to take children's vitamins if that's the case. Please call your doctor to make sure all is well. Take care.|`|j9axB0YMaa	I really wouldn't worry about it. I had cramps for the first 2 months of pregnancy and my Dr. said it was normal.   At 7 weeks I was in the hospital with high blood pressure, and rapid heart rate. Then @ 12 weeks I was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer and found out my heart was leaking. At 20 weeks I developed kidney stones. Now I'm 29 weeks and I've got gestational diabetes, I'm on medication to stop contracting, and I'm anemic. So not to say what your going through doesn't suck a little but believe me it could be a lot worse! Be thankful it's not.
rh12tX8Naa	You could be preggo. Get a home pregnancy test.|`|zdGpaFlfaa	u could be|`|pKr77Vqiaa	Deff take a test good luck you prob are|`|6yYeCVQFaa	If you missed your period get a home pregnancy test. Your level of HCG will be the highest in the morning. Stress also contributes to being late so stop freaking out. You may also want to look at how you are late and what is going on in your life that may be causing stress. Also it's a wise idea to invest in some type of birth control if you are not wanting a baby right now because sperm is some powerful stuff. My heart goes out to you. Best of luck!|`|Ltb8K9YUaa	That really does not mean anything.  My periods were always irregular.  But that does not mean you are not pregnant either.  If your period is late take a test.  Then you will know for sure.  Good luck.
kVBDpAMTaa	Anytime you have unprotected sex there is the chance of pregnancy. Also, your symptoms make it sound like you may be pregnant. You should take a pregnancy test on the day of you next expected period, that is when pregnancy tests are the most accurate.
UX3xjsFlaa	I let mine run around naked and when they needed to go they wouldnt go on the floor so they said potty or ran towards the nearest potty (insert mini portable potty)  Look for signs that your child is ready:  Can he/she pull up and down pants without assistance?  Is he/she noticabally uncomfortable with a wet/dirty diaper/pullup?  Good luck!|`|ppE0GtkIaa	Hi! I'm not sure if you child is a girl or boy but I find girls easy to potty trained and I do let them run around naked at home, its easy for them to run and sit and do their business, for boys try this, okay?  When my son was about to be potty trained and I did this also in the nursey school I worked for and it worked 100%. Buy some Fruit Loop ceareal and put 2 of each color Fruit Loops in the toilet bowl and make a game of it, tell him to aim for the Blue ones or the Red one and etc. He will start laughing and he will want you to do that all the time until he is fully peeing on his own. The  2 is the hardest part of all and my Dr told me that boys are scared to do  2 in the potty because they feel like they are losing part of themselves and you dont want to be yelling at him all the time because he will never do it and it will put stress on him. Another thing I did with my son was if he made a mess in his underwear, he was to clean his underwear and wash them in the sink with your supervision and believe me hes not going to like that all. Whatever you do, dont smile or laugh when he is doing this because he will think its a joke and wioll continue doing messes in his underwear. Boys are the hardest to train and I give this idea to alot of people and they love it. Also when he is sitting on the potty, you might want to put some books in a basket neear the toilet but when he is playing the Fruit Loop Game, you can move the basket. He can sit there and look at his books, sometimes its a distraction and he might be amaze of himself and you too and when he does do it, jump for joy, clap your hands, make it a party...lol Also do a sticker chart for every time he goes, he gets a star and say if he gets 7 stars, he gets a loittle prize of your choice or the other thing I did too was when he did  2 in the potty I would give him a nickel(they dont know the difference with coins but he was happy)...loland he can put it in his piggy bank, this worked on my little nephew too. He was fully potty trained at 4 and my sister never thought it was possible. Email me if you want other ideas, okay? Wish you the best Hon, it will become easy and you need to be patient with him, boys are stuborn. Good Luck!! :o) Also you can use the award system on your little girl too..:o)|`|JpE5ELbqaa	By being consistent and not putting too much pressure on her.  Take her to the potty every 40 minutes or so, whether she uses it or not.  The article I sited below states that it's not all about the child, but about the parent being consistent with it.
949AJbB6aa	I have the same thing. Eczema. It isn't generally cleared up by normal lotions he will probably get a steroid cream to clear it up. And it works really quickly.|`|jZguzD2Raa	its probably exema. i have that around my eyes and i called my doctor and she prescribed me a cream that cleared it up right away!. i would recommend calling a doctor|`|hfZIKrhCaa	go to the doctor|`|BXR26DqWaa	Maybe put some Vaseline on them to keep moisture in and so that nothing else can touch the affected area.|`|rGBP3W7Yaa	go to the doctor|`|Ybq7kznPaa	Maybe your son has eczema ? call his doctor. In the mean time try vaseline|`|oVcY7Bynaa	ask the babies dr im sure they will prescribe something good and that wont make the area hurt|`|H4UxIqe2aa	sounds like excema. see your doctor :)
Qe9rXFm0aa	No, I believe they need to be over 6 years old.  Let me try to find a link.      ChildrenUse by infants and children is not recommended, since they are especially sensitive to the effects of naphazoline.  http://www.drugs.com/cons/clear-eyes-lub...    http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/drug-in...|`|JP2h62qiaa	Why? Infection? Do you have breast milk? That is a good antibody. I wouldn't use clear eyes on a baby. I put it in my eyes when I was around 8 or so and it burned so bad. I was terrified to use it when I turned into an adult.  Ask your pediatrician..Warm water cloth and wipe the eye if some thing is in it. Good luck.|`|1Si9RlEXaa	No  I would not use clear eye on it!!! Try gently cleaning his eye with a clean cotton ball with cool water, swiping from inside out and using  a fresh one for each eye. If you are really worried then check with your doctor, but I think it's probable nothing. Just a blood vessel. My eyes get a little red when I  haven't had enough sleep, or hit my eyes which babies do often.|`|dc5bTUtmaa	NO|`|EmYNUZcXaa	NO!! why on earth would you want to??????????????|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I would not.|`|T0r5hofiaa	I don't think using clear eyes on a baby is a good idea. I'm afraid it would sting their eyes. Use a damp cloth or let it get out on it's own with crying.
76hNV3iqaa	If your father hits you then you MUST report him! No one (I don't care who they are) should EVER lay a hand on you. Plus say you are in fact pregnant, would you want your baby to be around someone who could potentially end up hurting/hitting your child? If he has no problem hitting you , then I promise you he will have no problem hitting your baby. I think you need to tell someone that way your dad can get help for his anger issues. I am a mother of a 2 and 1/2 year old little boy and I am pregnant (34 weeks) with a little girl, and I would NEVER EVER put either one of them in harms way by allowing them to be around someone who is that aggressive/abusive. I suggest that you find out for sure if you are pregnant( go to the doctor and get an ultrasound and a blood test, do not buy one) Then if you are pregnant then tell either your mom, or someone you are close with. Then the two of you(your mom/whoever) can go together and tell your dad. That way he is less likely to hit you with someone else around. He will more then likely be very upset at first, it is a BIG shock to parents. However I promise once you start showing and the realization of him being a grandpa sinks in, then he will become excited for you and the baby. Please just tell someone about how aggressive your dad can be, that way he can get help and you and him can become close again. Believe me you want your family to be in your child's life.  God Bless      and  Good Luck    PS. I will keep you in my prayers, also e-mail me if you need someone to talk to. I have been in a simular situation(not with my parents but an ex boyfriend.)|`|zdGpaFlfaa	take a test|`|QP8LdPLeaa	take a test, tell your parents as soon as possible so they can prepare for the better as soon as possible.|`|UYfqzCoMaa	Take a test and make sure 100% that you are pregnant. Then have another adult that you trust with you when you tell him. IF you think that he'll hit you then stay away from him while you are pregnant and even after so that your child won't be subject to his anger.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	dont tell him just you know um.....take a test and if its positive like go stay with somebody and make sure he doesnt know where you are. Leave him a note telling him that your pregnant and you love him even if you dont. Then just leave him and dont go back until you have the baby, or never tell him and get an abortion.    GOOD LUCK!|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	well if you are, make sure you have another adult with you when you tell him....let hope you non't at the age ,, it get a young life wasted ...|`|PFOtcMUHaa	GIRL..... if you are afraid your dad is going to hit you then your dad could have a problem especially if he has hit you before. I would wait though and be sure that you are pregnant.|`|3tWRpNIZaa	First take a test. And if you are see a doctor to confirm. Planned parenthood would be a great place to go. If it is confirmed you are pregnant tell another family member first. Then break it to your dad lightly. A few tears might break him down. If he does hit you I would suggest staying at a friends or relatives for a while. Good luck honey!|`|TOoNHNv9aa	first make sure you are pregnant. like someone else suggested.. go to planned parenthood before telling him. when i found out i was pregnant, was by a home pregnancy test.. it was positive. i went to planned parenthood and they did a test on me...positive.  so, after that i went and told my aunt and uncle because i was afraid to tell my mom.  they were very supportive and things turned out okay.  if your dad is going to hit you, for betraying his trust im guessing then tell him with another adult in the room.  he's going to be very surprised and maybe angry. but you never know, he might be supportive and want to help you. its very important that you start going to the doctor asap.|`|wOcsvaSmaa	test and find out for sure. tell him just be like i have to tell you something... im pregnant. if he hits you, call the cops.|`|9F6EKGLsaa	I noticed you have not mentioned your mum at all?  i don't mean to dredge up old wounds but if she is around to talk to, then I would suggest you do so first, or if you have any other family members/friends...    If you are truly worried about how your father will react then you will need to tell him in a controlled way, such as you make sure someone who already knows, is there with you. Not only for moral support but also just in case things get out of hand!    Have you considered how things are going to change in the future? although I do not condone it, you may not be ready for a child yet in which case abortion or adoption (if you decide to carry the child). But if you have made the decision to keep the child then I would suggest you contact your local council and get yourself onto the housing register and they can assign you with a worker to help you and walk you though the process of getting you own flat and benefits until the child is at an age where you can go back to work.    Although your dad will be angry at first, I whole heartily believe that if you can give him an assertive answerer's to the questions he will most likely ask, then you can take charge and Control the situation.|`|cUs60ETLaa	Alright girl. i'm 17 and pregnant. This is my storyy.   i only had to tell my Mother that i was pregnant, cause my Dad is outta the picture..   but i wen't over to her bestfriends house and told her that i was 9 weeks pregnant, and that i'm keeping the baby & that my Mom doesn't know.. and i need her help telling her.     I got her to come over and help me sit my Mom down and tell her the newss.. my Mom took it terribly. but my Mom had her bestfriend there that had time to cope with the news. and told her that it'd be okay..    That's my advice to you..   if you are/which hopefully your not..   you should get your Dad's bestfriend and tell him the news and ask for help.. and if your Dad get's mad and goes to hit you.. hopefully his friend will calm him and not let him hit youu.

LbkLg4RFaa	Being born in the caul has nothing to do with having baby acne.  Baby acne is caused by the mother's hormones in baby's system.  My son wasn't born in a caul and still developed baby acne or hormone rash.  It's quite normal for a baby to develop baby acne/ milk spots/ hormone rash.|`|EmYNUZcXaa	almost all babies get baby acne. its completely normal. its from your hormones still being in her body. it eventually goes away on its own. your not supposed to do anything for it or pick at it. it clears up by itself.|`|VSadTGgUaa	baby acne is normal. a large amount of babies get it.|`|LJhrtN9Uaa	im not sure what a caul is.. but baby acne is veryyy normal!!!|`|OLAtwLV6aa	its just the mothers hormones exiting the baby

I still remember my first time. I loved him very much but I was still scared.  Just relax, it will be more uncomfortable if you don't.  I suggest just letting your husband take control. Men are pretty well educated in that area even if they are virgins.  Just know that it might hurt at first and you might even bleed a little.  But in the end it is a beautiful thing so enjoy.

LKIhUMCgaa	yes, if u're about to have a period, u can become pregnant and still have that period come on time, since it's too early for ur pregnancy hormones to kick in to stop the cycle, but u're gonna miss ur next period though.|`|J7GTIE5raa	yea|`|VXvEN6dvaa	Yes.

And I have a happy healthy 16 year old niece to show for it.|`|OHdtV4qiaa	Yes you can. Some women even bleed every month while pregnant!

Xrwvu5Uraa	well you may have to wait until your next missed period to take a test and know for sure, or go to your doctor is your best bet in a couple week for a test.    now, you wouldnt be feeling those symptoms just quite yet four days into having unprotected sex and even two weeks ago if say the pill didn't work or something.    i know waiting may suck but it's something you have to do to get the most accurate answer!    good luck =)|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	it could be but it is hard to say, you could take a pregnancy test or wait till your next period, if it dosent come then test, or go and make a dr apointment|`|70kh6VSoaa	first off if your taking morning after pills and dont want a baby stop having unprotected sex. and dont fret about it because that will make you miss you . to|`|0iuvUhMpaa	Hey love, im sorry coz it sounds like this isnt want you want to hear but you could very well be pregnant,what you are experiencing could be implantatio bleeding which sometimes occurs when the egg implants in the uterus.

If you start your period the 8th I have been told by my doctor that implantation bleeding is usually right near your period which is why so many women think that they are getting their period. Stress will aggravate the situation so don't worry. Take a test and start using protection if you don't want children now.|`|Jn1ZfBxlaa	Sounds like your period came early to me.
SEzIkGNiaa	It all depends on your maturity.  But I would have to say at least 13 years of age with CPR and Babysitting courses, and babysitting experience.|`|ITZRv0XGaa	12 or older i guess well actually maybe 13 it depends on how responsible you are|`|4a92776fcff8d0cd8a0c9dbcf30bbfcfaa	There is got to be at least 10 years between you two|`|VOVjebIoaa	It depends of the age of the kids that you're babysitting. Legally, the age is 12. I am 12, but when I was younger I would always co  babysit with my older friends. If you're babysitting more than 1 child when you first start out and your under15, bring a friend 4 SURE!|`|oIFMohfUaa	Depending on what state you live in, it is usually minimum of 12 years old!  10 years old can stay home alone.    If it is you that wants to babysit, I would suggest going to a Red Cross Babysitting class.  People are much more likely to hire you AND  they usually pay a little more because they know you can do the job safely!    If you are the parents, I'd suggest looking into a sitter that has had this. OR...maybe you would like to pay for your future sitter to go to one!  Peace of mind!|`|cc2a9fa95b895badd94cab1b2f6a808baa	at least freshman in highschool or very responsible 8th grader. so at least 13/14 yrs old.|`|oF4HDT5Zaa	however old the parents (of the children you are going to babysit) want you to be.    i'm guessing around 13 or older|`|oWKZyItUaa	the youngest i would say is 13 but you would have to take different classes|`|G9xNZkUKaa	I Would Say 14 Years Old Because Your Old Enough Two Be Responsible And You Are Also Older Enough To Get A Part Time Job Now.|`|m1GEP2Ydaa	I took a Red Cross babysitting course in June 2008 when I was 11, and it was great! They teach you everything!    However, it depends on the maturity level. I wouldn't recommend babysitting at 11 if you haven't taken a course. I started babysitting at the age of 11.5 and I'm now 12.    I would say start at 12 years old.
SEzIkGNiaa	Hi there, I think it depends on maturity, but not age.  Above the age of 13 I think is resonable, with a CPR/babysitting certificate.|`|xMy0QEvFaa	I'd say older than twelve.    I'd hire someone who's fifteen and older, no younger than that.|`|Bcfw1rweaa	id say 12-13ishhhhhh|`|r2zdEfAcaa	I was 12. It depends on how mature you are.

mPTBU0QDaa	I doubt you're pregnant. You've probably just been worrying about it since you are having sex for the first time and because you thought about it so much, it is coming into your dreams.    Something to think about - no birth control is 100% effective. If you aren't ready to be pregnant, maybe stop having sex. There is no sure way to prevent it except to not have sex.|`|AhBM5w8maa	probably your subconscious or paranoia, i doubt you are pregnant.

But don't worry|`|x4uGfC4oaa	I have dreams that I give birth all the time.    Maybe if you're worried about pregnancy, you shouldn't have sex. Fifteen is too young anyway.

Harriet|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	Maybe the Universe is trying to tell you that if you're not careful and have protected sex,that could very well happen.

KozoNqpsaa	First of all, if your period is that irregular, it is tougher to get pregnant as you can't really determine when you're ovulating. Second, you sound pretty young and having unprotected sex is like playing with fire. In other words...don't do it! If you still live at home with your parents, I would advise talking to them first and then seeing your doctor. If you're older and/or on your own, make an appt with your doctor as soon as possible. If you are pregnant, you need to take care of your body for both you and the baby.  Good luck!|`|7nGwou8uaa	if youre having unprotected sex then yes you could be pregnant.|`|AA10655022	good girl...if u can access and use internet then u do have brain to let u know not to have unprotected sex,not just cause of pregnancy but u can giv ur bf herpies..and other std.go piss on a bulletproof stik,if it turns blue then HOORAAAYY,ur bf life is f'd up if not then u rnt preggo|`|jWO10NN5aa	Yes, you are pregnant, but from the sounds of this you have no business breeding.|`|glynFK9haa	If the tests are negative, I doubt it.

Just try and nap with her sometimes, or nurse her while lying in bed; I just pass out right away when I do that!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	how old is your little one- i honestly did not night wean until about 15 months but my son has always been skinny and i believe that halped him keep gaining. i just started rocking- it took longer to get him to sleep but eventually it did not- we put on son slow coutry music (which he likes) and sat in the glider and rocked him- now i can just read a book to him and pat his back and he's off to sleep on most nights. some nights he thinks it's still play time and tries to jump on the bed lol now if he is thirsty i do get him some water or sometimes offer the breast. he doesn't nurse much anymore though ( he's 21 months)     there is absolutely no way i would have switched to bottles at night- iw as pumping for work and the milk i had stored was just enough to get me by for work, plus the fact that i wanted my supply to stay up. my son was pretty skinny at 9 months was 29 1/4 inches and 17 pounds- so it was suggested i still nurse at night when he woke- and that's what i did. if your daughter continues to cry you'll know she is still hungry but i never truly knew a 6 month old who slept 12 hours straight. my son still doesn't do that most days- it's usually 10|`|68c6B8dRaa	...I didn't know how to answer this without knowing how old your baby was, so clicked on your profile...    6.5mo is way too young to consider this.

Lie down with her when she naps even if you can't sleep.|`|640c4c1f67ea41221d49294d28e598d8aa	Frequent night nursing is characteristic of high-need children. It's like going to their favorite restaurant. The ambiance is peaceful, the server is familiar, the cuisine is superb, and they love the management. Who can blame the all-night gourmet? Try these suggestions for dealing with all-night nursing:     1. What's the problem?     How much of a "problem" is the frequent night nursing? This stage of high level night nurturing will pass. Both you and your baby will someday sleep through the night. Yet, if you are sleep deprived to the degree that you are barely functioning the next day, you resent your nighttime parenting style (and your baby), and the rest of your family relationships are deteriorating, you need to make some changes in your nighttime feeding schedule.   A parenting principle we learned many kids ago is: IF YOU RESENT IT, CHANGE IT!     Even if you can't get your baby to sleep through the whole night, you can help him cut back on nighttime nursing, making the situation more tolerable for you. Here's how:     2. Tank your baby up during the day  Toddlers love to breastfeed, yet they are often so busy during the day that they forget to nurse, or mom is so busy that she forgets to nurse. But at night, there you are, only an inch away, and baby wants to make up for missed daytime nursings. (This is a common scenario when a breastfeeding mother returns to work outside the home.) Finding more time to nurse during the day may make the breast less attractive at night.     3. Increase daytime touch  Wear your baby in a sling and give your baby more touch time during the day. It's easy when babies get older to greatly decrease the amount of touching time without realizing it. All-night nursing can sometimes be a baby's signal reminding mothers not to rush their baby into dependence. In developing a healthy independence, a child leaves and comes back; lets go and clings, step by step until she is going out more than she is coming back. Many mothers have noted that babies and toddlers show an increased need for nursing and holding time right before undertaking a new stage of development, such as crawling or walking.     4. Awaken baby for a full feeding just before you go to bed  Rather than going off to sleep only to be wakened an hour or two later, get in a feeding when you retire for the night. This way, your sleep will be disturbed one less time, and you'll (hopefully) get a longer stretch of sleep.     5. Get baby used to other "nursings."  Try wearing him down to sleep in a baby sling. After baby is fed, but not yet asleep, wear him in a baby sling around the house or around the block. When he's in a deep sleep, ease him onto your bed and extricate yourself from the sling. This is a good way for dad to take over part of the bedtime routine. Eventually, your baby will associate father's arms with falling asleep, and he'll be willing to accept comfort from dad in the middle of the night as an alternative to nursing. Other ways to ease your baby into sleep without nursing him include patting or rubbing his back, singing and rocking, or even dancing in the dark to some tunes you like or lullabies you croon.     6. Make the breast less available  Once your baby has nursed to sleep, use your finger to detach him from the breast. Then pull your nightgown over your breast and sleep covered up. A baby who can't find the nipple quickly may just fall back to sleep. If you can stay awake long enough to put the breast away, he may not latch on again so soon.     7. Just say no!   When our son, Matthew, was two, Martha felt desperate for sleep if awakened more than two times. I would wake up to hear a dialogue like "Nee" (his word for nurse)"No!" "Nee!" "No!" "Nee!" "No, not now. In the morning. Mommy's sleeping. You sleep, too." A firm but calm, peaceful voice almost always did the trick. You can manage to stay peaceful in this situation when you know you are not damaging your very secure, attachment- parented child.     8. "Nummies go night-night."   Now the marketing begins. Around eighteen months, your child has the capacity to understand simple sentences. Program your toddler not to expect to be nursed when she awakens, such as "We'll nurse again when Mr. Sun comes up." When you nurse her to sleep (or have the first or second night nursing) the last thing she should hear is "Mommy go night-night, Daddy go night-night, baby go night-night, and nummies go night- night" (or whatever she dubs her favorite pacifiers). When she wakes during the night the first thing she should hear is a gentle reminder, "Nummies are night- night. Baby go night-night, too." This program may require a week or two of repetition. Soon she will get the message that daytime is for feeding and nighttime is for sleeping. If "nummies" stay night-night, baby will too -- at least till dawn.     9. Offer a sub  High-need babies are not easily fooled; they don't readily accept substitutes. Yet, it's worth a try. Remember, nursing d|`|FLpMShKNaa	The Dr. Sears stuff and No Cry Sleep Solution did not work for us. I know people will give me thumbs down, but I put my breastfed baby on a schedule at 7 mos because I was losing my mind, and he was terribly overtired. I figured even if he was scarred for life, it was better than me falling asleep at the wheel and having an awful accident with him in the car. The funny thing was, once he started getting good sleep, the next day daycare (who didn't know we had done it) told us he was much happier and like a new baby-gone was the constant eye rubbing and frequent whining, and we were much better parents.   The suggestions in the Healthy Sleep Habits book really helped-and yes, when I first read it I thought the author was came of as a jerk but many of his suggestions helped. Only you know what you can take-maybe frequent night feedings and co-sleeping was great for others, but every parent and child is different. For us, a schedule gave Adam a sense of security and structure, he enjoys his awake time and is more active and I nursed almost the whole 12 months, and have other frineds who used the Healthy sleep habits book, and a schedule and nursed past one year. Sorry so long !!  EDIT_We tried the "gradauted extinction" method for a week and it worked at 1st, and seemed less awful,I read the healthy sleep habits book which said if you go in and pat them every so often, they'll just revert to old habits and  unfortunately it was true. And, if your child is really in distress you are mom and you'll no the difference, Even after I mostly night weaned I would occassionally bf at night, because by that time waking up was not routine and I knew he was truly hungry. If you can stand it, the crying becomes less and less. We do try and do a soothing night time routine, bath and then bed. I think if it you can get through it now, it is such  great investment in you and your child's well being-please know it does get better and feel free to email me if you need moral support.|`|TVC3mAP7aa	What really helped us was a bit unconventional, but it worked.  I started pumping and we would only give bottles at night, instead of nursing.  At the very least, this will give you a break and give dad some wake up time.  What I found out though, was that he'd sleep for much longer intervals when given a bottle as opposed to nursing.  My theory is that he'd get more milk because he wasn't quite as comfy and could stay awake long enough to eat more.  We also made sure to give him the bottle while he was still laying in the crib.  This helped to just fill his belly and kept him from waking up completely and also prevented him from expecting cuddle time in the middle of the night.      We started this at around 6 months (I think!) and it helped me immensely.  Initially, he was still waking up every 3 or 4 hours, but the intervals have gradually become longer and he's now been nearly STTN for the last 3 or 4 weeks (he's 9 months now).  He goes down around 9 and normally doesn't wake until 5 or 6 for food and then he'll go back down for another hour or so.      No-Cry Sleep Solution didn't do much for us either.  Hang in there, it will get better!!|`|ib5nNdsWaa	Ripped that bottle out of both of their mouths and threw them in the trash   I ask them "What do you think you are? A BABY?"

Working on a cannery line, whether with fish or fruit, is a great first job - it's mindless of course but you learn a lot about actually working, showing up on time, and what it takes.   Once you have your first job and are a good worker it opens more doors to other jobs, and at your age you could also think about the Job Corps - another avenue for getting out there.   Honestly I expect your fear about working has more to do with inexperience then anxiety, once you start doing it and are successful it will help you out so much.

Keep nose clean as possible, by using the nose aspirator, Put a pillow under your babys crib mattress to keep his head elevated.The humidifier works great, usually they have a little pocket just below where the steam comes out for medicine,( Vicks vapor), u can buy at any pharmacy.

They had no other information to go on. Now with the help of ultrasound technology, doctors are able to make a more definitive diagnosis.    SCH or Subchorionic Hematoma is a gathering of blood between the membranes of the placenta and the uterus. A more technical name is the chorion. Some doctors will also just refer to it as a blood clot.    Causes of Subchorionic Hematoma  There is no known cause for a SCH but many researchers speculate that during egg implantation, the egg slightly separates or tears from the uterus causing a bleed. There is nothing a woman did or could have done to cause or prevent them. SCH occurs to pregnant women of all ages and races.    Diagnosing Subchorionic Hematoma  Diagnosing a SCH is based on its symptoms and visualization via ultrasound scan. Many women visit the doctor or emergency department with the chief complaint of vaginal bleeding during early pregnancy. An ultrasound, either transvaginal or abdominal, would more than likely be carried out. During the ultrasound scan, the doctor or radiologist will locate the fetus and assess its current condition. Identifying a SCH by an untrained eye is difficult. The clot appears as a black mass within the uterus. It almost appears as if another placenta is present. Ordinary ultrasound images appear blackish with visuals of bone. After a visual of the blood clot is made, and it appears a woman is not having a miscarriage, the diagnosis of SCH is made.    Having a diagnosis of SCH instead of a miscarriage is probably a relief but having SCH comes with its own concerns.    Treatment of Subchorionic Hematoma  There is no formal treatment for this blood clot but each doctor is different. Some suggest that you can continue with your everyday activities while others may suggest taking it easy. Some physicians even suggest refraining from sexual intercourse throughout pregnancy and bed rest. Surgery is not an option. Straining and heavy lifting should be avoided- as such for a normal pregnancy.    Some doctors prefer a wait and see approach while others choose to use medications. Blood thinners such as: aspirin, Lovenox (inj), Coumadin and Heparin (inj) are used in attempts to bleed the clot out. Estrogen and Progesterone therapy is also sometimes used to aid in the development of the pregnancy.    The current statistics for pregnancy loss with a SCH is 1-3%. This low percentage is related to large clots. Most pregnancies progress with no further complications. Most clots resolve on their own by 20 weeks of pregnancy. The clot either bleeds itself out or the body absorbs it.    Women with SCH are at greater risk for placental abruption or abruptio placenta. Placental abruption is when the placenta tears away from the uterus. This is an extreme pregnancy complication that requires immediate medical attention. If the placenta separates from the uterine wall, the health of the fetus is in danger.    SCH is a risk early in pregnancy because the clot itself can cause a miscarriage. The clot can release completely from the uterus and cause the fetus and placenta to miscarry.    Women with SCH may experience intermittent periods of vaginal bleeding throughout their pregnancy. This experience would more than likely be a result of the clot bleeding out. Blood is an irritant to the uterus and cramping may be accompanied with the bleeding. While seeing blood while pregnant can be very scary-it is very common with SCH. Tampons and sexual intercourse is not generally recommended during bleeding/spotting periods.    Allow yourself adequate rest and plenty of fluids. Dehydration can also cause the uterus to contract-irritating your baby and the clot.    If youve been diagnosed with SCH, youre not alone. Support groups have been popping up all over the internet in recent years. Women from all across the globe have been gathering through the World Wide Web to share their experiences and offer hope to others going through the exact same thing.    If youre ever in doubt about your condition, you should never hesitate to contact your doctor. Information gathered here should only be used as a reference and not a substitute for actual medical care.|`|HFKVREiUaa	yes, im going thru it ow, im 12 weeks, it started at 7 weeks, i saw my doctor last Thursday who explained it to me and it will go away on it's own, it is a tiny blood vessel that burst from the outside of the placenta.in your case it probley wasnt tiny. good luck. cute photo by the way!|`|8b96e3040c5552a5ae7c3bdd523c1c0faa	Subchorionic hemorrhage (subchorionic hematoma) is the most common sonographic abnormality in the presence of a live embryo. Vaginal bleeding affects 25% of all women during the first half of pregnancy and is a common reason for first-trimester ultrasonography. Sonographic visualization of a subchorionic hematoma is important in a symptomatic woman because pregnant women with a demonstrable hematoma have a prognosis worse than women without a hematoma. However, small, asymptomatic subchorionic hematomas do not worsen the patient's prognosis.    In women whose sonogram shows a subchorionic hematoma, the outcome of the fetus depends on the size of the hematoma, the mother's age, and the fetus's gestational age. Rates of miscarriage increase with advancing maternal age and increasing size of hematoma. Late first- or second-trimester bleeding also worsens the prognosis.    The subchorionic hemorrhage (subchorionic hematoma) collects between the uterine wall and the chorionic membrane and may leak through the cervical canal. Later in the first trimester and early second trimester, the subchorionic hematoma may partially strip the developing placenta away from its attachment site. Therefore, the prognosis of patients with this type of hematoma is worse than the prognosis of patients with hematoma early in first trimester1    The subchorionic hematoma often regresses, especially if it is small or moderate in size. Large hematomas, which strip at least 30-40% of placenta away from endometrium, may enlarge further, compressing the gestational sac and leading to premature rupture of membranes with consequent spontaneous abortion.    United States  The incidence of subchorionic hemorrhage (subchorionic hematoma) is 1.3% of all pregnancies. In pregnant patients with first-trimester vaginal bleeding, the incidence increases to almost 20%. Bennett et al2 reported a spontaneous abortion rate of 9.3% in patients with first-trimester vaginal bleeding who had a live fetus and subchorionic hematoma. Overall, hematoma is associated with a 4-33% rate of miscarriage depending on the gestational age when the complication occurs.    Mortality/Morbidity  The presence of sonographically detected subchorionic hemorrhage (subchorionic hematoma) increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, abruptio placentae, and preterm labor.  The rate of spontaneous abortion directly varies with the size of subchorionic hematoma and the mother's age. The rate of spontaneous abortion is inversely related to gestational age. The frequency of fetal demise is higher with retroplacental hematoma than with marginal subchorionic hematoma.    Race  No significant racial differences have been reported with subchorionic hemorrhage (subchorionic hematoma).    Age  Bennett et al2 reported that the spontaneous abortion rate in women aged 35 years or older is twice as high as that in younger women. After age 35 years, the first-trimester miscarriage rate reflects maternal age.    Anatomy  Before the fertilized ovum reaches the uterus, the mucous membrane of the body of the uterus increases in vascularity and thickness; it is then called the decidua. The part that covers the ovum is named the decidua capsularis. The portion that intervenes between the ovum and the uterine wall is named the decidua basalis; the placenta subsequently develops here. A small amount of bleeding may result from the implantation of the fertilized ovum in the first trimester.    The chorion consists of 2 layers: an outer layer formed by the trophoblast and an inner layer formed by the somatic mesoderm. The trophoblast undergoes rapid proliferation and forms numerous processes called chorionic villi, which invade the uterine decidua and simultaneously absorb from it nutritive materials for embryonic growth. The chorionic villi increase in size and ramify, while the mesoderm, which carries branches of the umbilical vessels, grows into them; in this way, they are vascularized. Branches of the umbilical arteries carry blood to the villi. After circulating through the capillaries of the villi, the umbilical veins return blood to the embryo.    The placenta connects the fetus to the uterine wall and is the organ by which the nutritive, respiratory, and excretory functions of the fetus are performed. The placenta is composed of fetal and maternal portions. The fetal portion consists of the villi of the chorion, and the maternal portion is formed by the decidua placentalis containing the intervillous space.    Chorionic separation from its site of endometrial attachment can lead to hemorrhaging (hematomas) in various locations in the vicinity of its original implantation. These hematomas are referred to as marginal subchorionic hematomas, in which only the placental margin is separated; retroplacental hematoma, in which bleeding is behind the placenta; and subamniotic (preplacental) hemorrhage, in which a hematoma collects anterior to the placenta and is limited by the umbilical cord.3     Subchorionic hemorrhage (hematoma) is the most common, and preplacental hematoma is the rarest. The incidence of retroplacental hematoma increases in the third trimester.      Presentation  Most patients with a small subchorionic hemorrhage (subchorionic hematoma) in the first trimester are asymptomatic.4 Common manifestations of subchorionic hematoma are idiopathic premature labor, painless vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, and threatened abortion in the first or second trimesters.5     Symptoms of third-trimester placental abruption, observed in approximately 1% of gestations, are vaginal bleeding, a painful and tense uterus, fetal distress,6 and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Marginal abruptions are more common than retroplacental abruptions in women with mild clinical symptoms.      Preferred Examination  Ultrasonograph

mjz8JF9Gaa	he could be?    but most likely dates got messed up some were down the line   like my MIL     said he first was a preemie   said she didnt know she was preganat till she felt movements   said he was born at 7 months weigihing 8 lbs   and went home at regular discharge and doc. gave her no medicine to help grow babies lungs and he had no problems and was not in NICU     dates were obiviously wrong|`|rFtKFp03aa	HE was prematurely born.. even though he was 8lbs, imagine if he was born full term he would be like 10..     Also, maybe the due date was wrong..     premature according to dictionary means born before the end of full term..     I would say he was a lucky preterm baby|`|zif7kxswaa	a preemie, is just a baby that is born before 37 weeks, well sometimes 36 depending on who you talk to. both of my sons were 'preemie' but both weighed 6lbs and some change, and both were perfectly healthy. but no matter how big the baby itself is, if it is born before 36-37 weeks, there is a chance that it's lungs will not be strong enough to breathe on their own. hope this answers your question!     p.s. i'd guess that your bf's mother had gestational diabetes or just regular diabetes, that would be about the only reason that here baby would weigh 8 lbs that early on. or, they just had her dates wrong, which isn't unheard of either.|`|iTXnHiwTaa	You're considered premature if you're born before 37 weeks. Before 32 (I think) is extreme prematurity and before 25 is a "micro-preemie". He might have been around 10lbs or so had he gone "full term". Lungs are the last things to fully mature, they keep maturing almost right up until baby is full term.  A lot of preemies have issues with their lungs.|`|Y9IoElMBaa	No this is not always the case when it comes to premature babies. His mother could have had gestational diabetes which lead her to having a bigger than average baby. Or he could have just  been a normally large baby, but born premature. Their are plenty of normally healthy babies who are born premature babies who have small things wrong with them at first but that clears up very early.   As the saying goes, no two pregnancies are alike and no two babies are the same.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	My son was born at 36 1/2 weeks.  He was 7 pounds 5 ounces, which is larger than many full-term babies.  He is, in the strictest sense of the word, premature.  From a medical perspective, he didn't really need any real treatment for this, because he had no health problems.  But he's still considered premature.    Prematurity only means that he was born before his mother's pregnancy reached term.  That's all it means.  Some are healthy, some are not.      There is always the possibility in these cases (and it's a possibility in mine as well) that the due date was not accurate.      If your boyfriend was born at 36 weeks, he's premature no matter what he weighed at birth.|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Being a preemie has nothing to do with size. It has to do with WHEN they were born. If he came a month early, then yes, he was a preemie.|`|nfzQkvqraa	I had an ultrasound with my son when I was 7 months pregnant and he already weighed an estimated 7 1/2 lbs.  When he was born he weighed over 9.  Had he been born premature he obviously would have been like your boyfriend, and had been an 8 lb. baby.  The last couple of months in the womb are for growth.  Obviously if you have a baby a month earlier than you're due they will weigh less than if you had them at full term.  This doesn't mean that every premature baby will be born weighing 5 lbs. or whatever.  Your boyfriend was just a larger baby than average.      I happened to be a month and a half premature and only weighed 3 lbs. 6 oz.  So it definitely varies.|`|0viZhxi6aa	My son was a preemie, born at 32 w 5 d. He was 3 lb 14 oz and on the vent for only 3 days, though, so yay him! His NICU neighbor was born at 26 weeks He was 1 lb 11 oz. That's what I call a "real" preemie. But according to the docs at my hospital anything before 37 weeks is technically premature regardless of size.
AmqQ9it5aa	Culver's minimum hiring age is 14 with a workers permit.    I called many stores because I am 14 looking for a job. This was the response they gave which makes me happy after looking for so long.    Find a local one go online and apply and go in store to apply or call and ask if they are hiring.      What I did was Google a bunch of business near my home and found their numbers using Google maps or their sites and I called and directly asked if they are hiring and what age do they hire at.

The name comes from Swietenia mahagoni - which is a tree. So it's really no more unusual than other tree names like Willow, Olive, Holly, Maple or Ash.

The "Daniel" part is cool but Boston? Ehhh... it's okay. It sounds kind of weird for a name.|`|7Ds5E0SXaa	Absolurley cute! I ? It.   :))|`|F8m04KSoaa	I like it. When I was younger I used to love to think of my kids names, but then you get married and your hubby hates every names you spent hours choosing and you go with something you never thought of!!!!!|`|HEbRskINaa	Sooo cute!  I'v always loved the name Boston.   I would most definately use it.
ddP3klT3aa	After a month? If some one doesn't return a call (in this kind of situation) within a few days, you should always call back. Within a few days. This woman probably won't even remember your sister and will think she is disinterested since she didn't call sooner. Wouldn't hurt to try. Managers are very busy and have a hard time remembering to call any one. Its always polite to call them back.|`|AA11348344	No, if your sister applied for the job then she needs to get her job. If the women hasn't called back she needs to call her back and tell her that she is ready for her traning.|`|9zwSclnLaa	No, your sister needs to follow up and get her job.  It was rude of that woman not to call back.|`|9vz1bsFzaa	She should call and say how she was told about being accepted for the job, and wondering when her training would start. It's good to follow up, I just hope she didn't wait too long.|`|9aIotOULaa	no she should definitely call back|`|UYJBPFj6aa	hell yeah, it is rude..    i would prank call her and tell her to    ?^? ?(???)? ?^?   off....  and don't tell her who i am.. and just mess with the bltch.|`|Tkx0uSb5aa	your sister should definitely call her potential boss back.  the woman may have lost your sister's number.|`|hl5WdXnbaa	I would call....but I don't think your sister should work for someone who seems to have shitty business practises.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	no it wouldnt be rude. its just to find out what the heck her boss is doing!|`|AmqQ9it5aa	No. It's normal to follow up on a job offer. It's smart not rude.

uwxezFHjaa	every baby is different im sure she is fine once she starts on baby food her growth will take off and before you know it you will be sayin what happend to my little girl how did she grow up so fast|`|n6XYYyoLaa	sounds a little light; how does she fall on the growth curve at the doc's ?? if she is following her curve and the doc isn't worried, i wouldn't be either; some babies are smaller, some are bigger....and they can all be normal|`|2932ee4950edd4f131a711d029cc8528aa	Check this "growth chart" to see where she lies.  http://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http...|`|FLpMShKNaa	Sounds fine-my son was 13.1 lbs at 4 months, and boys are generally bigger. Your doctor would let you know of there are any problems at her well baby check, did she have one at 4 months? Also, remember all babies are different, if she acts healthy and happy, eats well, etc. don;t compare her to other babies. My son is not on the chart for weight but he is healthy and active and dad and I are both small.  Enjoy your baby!!|`|c76bc0ffbd77bfaaa2937eb65cf4e252aa	My daughter just turned 5 months and is 14 lbs.

58X0RRPgaa	5'3 and 120 lbs is not even near overweight!   My daughter is 13... 5'3 and 110 lbs...and she is a stick!   If you're losing weight, just make sure to do it safely...don't do dumb crash diets or skip meals...it doesn't help at all, and can make you sick. Healthy eating and exercise is the best way  =)|`|bTvrv59saa	You should gain about 40lbs. 20 lbs for the baby, 20 for it's and your health. If you don't it not healthy.|`|deIzFnV8aa	Beside the issue if you need to lose weight, make sure you aren't hurting yourself or your baby.  Are you breastfeeding? That will not only help you lose weight, but it hurts you and your baby to diet while you are doing this.  You may find your baby isn't gaining weight if you don't eat enough calories to make rich milk!  You might want to consider losing weight by making sure you eat healthy foods low in fat, instead of eating  _less_ food. Also consider doing some form of exercise, like walkign with your baby, or getting a "mommy and baby" exercise routine.  But please, make sure you aren't starving yourself or your baby!|`|aJLx0nhNaa	I'm sorry, but this sounds like a terrible idea.  Are you talking about using prune juice to deliberately give yourself diarrhea after meals?  You'll dehydrate yourself, throw your electrolyte balance off and put yourself in the hospital.      Your baby needs you to be alert and focused, not wasting away on a crash diet.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	sounds like you have an eating disorder at 5'3 120 is a good weight 105 is a little skinny but can also be considered ok but seriously don't starve yourself over it|`|zQAWuMN4aa	Um at your height you don't NEED to lose weight. I am currently 5 ft tall and unfortunately 128; it's baby weight. Yuck. You can work on getting toned up though.|`|FLpMShKNaa	I am afraid skipping meals might take a toll on you. I gained almost 40 lbs, and lost it very slowly, a lot thru nursing, but also just over time. Remember, slow steady weight loss is usually the most permanent. How old is your baby? In the beginning, you are jacked up on stress and adrenaline, then you crash. Good luck and please take care of yourself! :)|`|ubkt5RQiaa	what is working for me is eating less calories than I burn.  You can find calculators online and see just by daily activity how many calories you burn.  If you eat 500 less than you burn per day you will lose about a pound a week.  Skipping meals isn't good, it is advised to eat several small meals a day to keep your metabolism going.    http://www.healthstatus.com/health_blog/...|`|vpL67nETaa	You are at the healthy weight for your height.    You don't need to lose weight.    Eating one meal and day and a small snack in itself is an eating disorder.  Combine that with trying to flush your system with things like prune juice, and that's definitely unhealthy behavior.    You're already depriving your body of proper nutrients (taking a vitiman doesn't make up for crash dieting) and by trying to intentionally boost your digestion via prune juice is only exacerbating that, and will most definitely throw off your electrolytes.
LGidAYDwaa	The stepson's mom needs to back off. You're in charge of your house and the stepson just better toe the line. He should know better than to act up - and he likely does it just because it causes hell for you all.  Make a chart of rules and consequences of breaking them. Show them to your husband and - if you ever have to discipline your stepson, you will have that chart to back you up. It's not like he can claim he didn't do anything wrong if you have the list of unacceptable behavior!  If things still go awry with the stepson's mom again, it is up to your husband to step in and support you. That chart will be a lifesaver if he can finally get it through to his ex that there will be discipline in the home. "if you spare the rod, you spoil the child". Everyone has to have boundaries, and that means rules and consequences for breaking them. Good luck!    http://ezinearticles.com/?Setting-Bounda...  setting boundaries for your kids|`|VR9KhbEgaa	When my step sons are at my house they are expected to follow my rules. Personally, this has caused us lots of problems with their mother. But this is my house and I have rules, if they don't like them then too bad! I don't feel I ask that much of any of the kids ( we have 6 in total...2 his,2 mine, 2 ours). But I will by no means put up with someone talking back & smarting off to me....my 4 know this, his 2 try to push me but they lose every time! Everyone has the same set of rules and they are all expected to follow them or pay the consequence. You have to force your husband to back you 100 %!! The only thing I do not do is spank his 2. I leave that for my husband to do when he gets home if it is warranted. I finally told my stepsons mother if she does not like me making them follow my household rules then she can just keep them at home on all the weekends until my husband gets off work at 6pm on Sat. evening. Needless to say she changed her attitude as well because that was going to interfere in her "partying" time!|`|AA11148769	When a child is in your house, he follows your rules.  If they don't then they get punished the same as you would unish your own children for breaking the same rules.  Maybe you could sit down with your husband and ask him if this sounds fair to him and for him to tell your stepson's mother about this.  Your house.  Your rules.  Your consequences.  No exceptions.|`|zTal4HIGaa	I think its fine to punish YOUR step-son its your husbands son ask your husband if its ok with him if he says yes then you can if he says no then i guess you can not if my shoes were in your husbands i would say yes but,only when he needs to be punished|`|vSLHaTFHaa	Are you his mom???  NO.  Then don't punish him.  DUH.|`|4t6ABZcfaa	your house your rules your the boys moma too now.|`|efbb15bd3b273c3e6801e5fe2b1add09aa	If you are in charge, then your husband should back you 100%, either that or he should change the visitation to be during hours when he is actually going to spend time with his child so that he can be the main caregiver and disciplinarian.  You can't sacrifice order in your home or else the stepson and biomom will have so much influence in what goes on in your home that you'll be pulling your hair out.|`|AA11537580	have a meeting with the mother and your husband and work the punishment thing out.  If your with your step son during the day and he misbehaves then he has to have a time out or something.  He gets punished at school for misbehaving, right?!(or he would if he misbehaved)|`|J2gr1ogHaa	You need to have a talk with your husbands ex. Tell her how you punish and that you do the same to your son when he misbehaves. I do not pop other peoples children. I will put them in timeout or take a toy away or something, but when it comes to my daughter and stepdaughter it will be equal punishment. If my daughter writes on the wall, she will be popped and made to scrub the mess away. Same goes for my stepdaughter.    If your husbands ex has a problem with the way you punish, maybe she should teach him to mind and be respectful. If you cant come to a happy compromise or solution, your stepson should only be there when your husband is. A child should not disrespect an adult especially if it is one that cares for them.
O20eJDd4aa	In my extended family there are quite a few who have 4 kids or more (they live in Africa) and a quick overview: another boy-girl-boy-boy, another as well, then boy-boy-girl-boy, then there's 3 boys-girl, and 3 girls-boy.    So your chances are still pretty good I think. There is more and more research into what conditions are more favourable to conceive a boy or a girl, all sorts of things are mentioned, your weight, your diet, the time of the month, you and your husband's age and so on, so you might like to do a google on that.    Good luck!|`|gz7YVvKlaa	My mother had 3 girls and then finally a boy but we lost his tragically before he was born, so my mother tried again and we must of had fate with us because she gave birth to a healthy baby boy.    I've heard that different sexual positions help with the X chromosome sperm reach the egg faster then the Y chromosome sperm.|`|1uyhFsFsaa	it didn't feel like 50/50 to me lol   i had 5 girls then a boy i thought i was gonna have an all girls football team at one point.     my mother had me girl then 4 boys she never did get the 2nd girl she wanted     it is possible|`|FA710vETaa	it all depends on daddy|`|rTLZMcQhaa	My friends mother had 3 daughters and then 3 boys followed then 1 girl then another boy!    my mother had 5 sons, then 1 girl (me) and then 1 more boy. she craved a girl for a while then got stuck with beautiful me lol|`|5GLctBS2aa	I have 8 boys I say that the 50/50 split is BS lol|`|3TT2ErHZaa	It all depends on your mate. The women already have an x chromosome. The man either passes the x or y. So, you can blame him if you don't get what you want. lol. Hope that helps.|`|AA10747002	Actually if you look up the statistics, women are more likely to have a boy than a girl, in the US anyhow. So yes, more boys are born than girls in the US.
427abcdfcd8e012fe37537ef1426e40faa	You can give lots of foods at this age.  You'd be amazed at how well they can mash things up with their gums.  My youngest didn't get his first tooth until after his first birthday, but he was eating almost everything we were by that point (with the exception of chewing raw veggies, tough meat, etc.).  We always started slow with the quantity of solids (only one meal per day until 8-9 months, then 2 meals until 10 months, etc.), but my kids loved eating whatever was on our plates.    This is a breastfeeding site, and I'm not sure if you're breastfeeding or formula-feeding, but there's a lot of great info about starting solids here.  http://www.kellymom.com/nutrition/solids...  Check out the "First Foods" and "Finger Foods" suggestions for lots of ideas.|`|9vz1bsFzaa	Cooked baby carrots, or mashed potatos (without milk, of course). Any food you eat, mashed/pureed, not containing milk or honey, apple sauce, etc. If you do give him finger food, make sure you watch him though!|`|cDVAEHgCaa	I don't agree that there's no point in using baby food.  Totally false.  A lot of babies like to have pureed foods. My daughter enjoys it.       My daughter is 7 months old, and I have been giving her Gerber Puffs and Zwieback toast for a couple of weeks.  She hasn't mastered the "pincher grip" just yet, so we'll keep working on it!  I'd like to start adding things like peas, carrots, maybe cubes of cheese and toast.      **By the way, most babies use their gums to mash food, not their front teeth.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	I stopped pureeing food and started giving my son finger food/table food around 6.5 or 7 months (he started solids at 5 months)....|`|oaF2kaXAaa	There really isnt a point in the baby food... its just convenience if your not eating very well... babys can eat whatever your eating by 6 months... just mashed up versions of course. Two teeth can mash up a lot! potatoes, carrots, whatever you feel comfortable giving your baby..|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I started finger foods around 8 months with both of my kids. Gerber Puffs are good to start with-They're easy to pick up, and dissolve in baby's mouth. Cheerios are also good. My daughter seems to prefer the multi-grain ones. Cooked carrots are good because they're really soft, easy to pick up, and not too messy. My daughter is 10 months and only has two teeth as well. You'd be surprised at how much a mostly toothless baby can chew!
XwjL8PZCaa	yeah my son had every single tooth including all molars by like 13 months old and he had 4 teeth by the end of 4 months going to 5 months old, so it is totally normal some babies are born with teeth.|`|RKJIYTtJaa	I took my daughter to the dr for her 18 month check and she already had her 2 year molars... so im guessing its possible! Good luck with that its not fun!!!
0ILy1p3taa	I made it to 11 weeks or so.  I lived in PJs mostly at home so I only needed stuff for when I left the house. My SIL is preggers with her first and at nearly 26 weeks she has yet to buy maternity pants...she just gets bigger sizes in the regular stuff and she is really getting along too!|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	yeah im 21 and a half weeks pregnant and I don't fit into my regular clothes anymore, some shirts but no pants. I'm sticking to yoga pants and sweats for now because maternity clothes do not fit me...as I have to get a smaller size...but if you are having a problem finding clothes to wear to work and such try buying a smaller size maternity clothes if you do not fit into the ones you may already have. good luck =)|`|LKIhUMCgaa	when i was early in my pregnancy, bout the same time as u, i had to start wearing maternity pants already bc the pants were pushing down on my belly too much, my baby girl ended up growing VERY low in my abdominal at first, which made it so hard to wear any other pants, but close to 23 weeks she moved up a lot, so i was able to wear my old pants again.|`|dd1c8373d258bab9181f891f88ea8dafaa	Girl you made it 9 weeks in your second pregnancy? Thats awesome!    Its not too early to break it out, how could it be? if your'e uncomfortable in what you're wearing now then its time for the next step.|`|dp2oNqa0aa	its not too earlyy all that matters is that your comfortablee.And congratulationss!!!!|`|Gdy6LSLeaa	i hate maternity clothes, i am prego with  2 and this time i just went to good will and bought bigger sized clothes. i think they fit better. i hate maternity pants cuz they are so tight on your butt and thighs.|`|43a27c0e1eef30eef2164c4c15242ab3aa	hahaha I was in my pants at 7-8 weeks!!!!! you will love life in those big waisted pants :)
wZNWhjoAaa	wait until you have regular cycles. when your cycles are irregular its hard to try to conceive. what the doctors told me was to wait at least 2 regular cycles so that your uterus can get back to normal because you could end up having another miscarriage if you try too soon and your uterus hasnt fully recovered. i had an ectopic in august 2008 and a miscarriage jan 10, 2009.|`|dLANPlFfaa	you're pro-life but you voted for obama? wow. that's pretty hypocritical.
6e9wMh6yaa	With. There's no chance of her suffocating. Thats usually for kids under 1 year old. Then, you have to be realy careful|`|wiAVa1H5aa	At her age it doesn't really matter, she's far outside the range for SIDS, right now it's whether she wants one or sleeps better with one.|`|N0k6iZFRaa	Mine sleeps much better with a pillow.|`|nvsVXlBlaa	i let my 3 year old|`|1MEnCmwoaa	If she likes it then let her use one.   My daughter is 16 months and had a cold last week and i tried a pillow and she did not like it! she is a squirmy sleeper so anytime she squirmed off the pillow she woke up upset.   i will wait on the pillow for a while. But at 2.5 i bet she would like one.|`|XujomifIaa	yeah my 3 yr old has been sleeping with her own princess pillow since she was a yr old.. So it's perfectly normal.. So whatever makes her more comfortable.
PhNzEkVnaa	Sounds like she needs some guidance and consistency.  If she is supervised in the setting that she is in I guess it is the best that you can do at the moment.   If she is getting kicked out she obviously isn't behaving very well.  There may not be a whole lot that you can do.  She is either going to behave or not.  From past experience I will offer this, spoiled kids take longer to grow up than those less catered to.  If you want her with you maybe you could have her do an independent study or home school thing or tutoring so that she has parental supervision.|`|d35196945d1d19350f0b8c88b0531a6caa	Maybe you should have her stay with your parents since that is where you stay when you work from home.
HtBcGy1raa	I love Autumn!! That's what I want to name one of my children one day. If I have two girls, I will name them Alana and Autumn. =)    I like both Winter and Summer, although personally, I've never heard of Winter being used as a child's name. The name Autumn is beautiful, though I'm probably biased since it's my favorite season. I also love the sound of the word/name, though. It's mysterious yet warm.    Have a good day!|`|4vfDveiZaa	The reason that people usually name their daughters things like summer or april or june, etc. is because they make people think of the "spring" or "summer" of someone's life, meaning that they are young and beautiful.  Autumn or winter has not been very common for two reasons, 1) it makes people think of the "autumn" or "winter" of their life (when they are old) and 2) it makes her sound cold (meaning the opposite of hot). For those reasons I would suggest summer.|`|MWV5yxY4aa	Autumn : )|`|oMTsDcNBaa	I like Summer, then Autumn, then Winter.    Winter doesn't sound that bad. It sounds pretty cute.|`|RI1brp91aa	Winter     And     Autumn |`|yXi3M5A3aa	I like Summer better also I think because it's my favorite season of the year.|`|nPZi0wzYaa	Autumn|`|7FvVx3kVaa	Winter (I would of never thought of that)|`|dEzGutVSaa	I work with a girl named Autumn, and I Absolutely love her name!|`|c8WPYjU3aa	Winter and Summer|`|PO2SeOfOaa	i personally like Autumn....  maybe Autumn Rain  or Autumn Rose or something cute like that =D|`|BAjc1fZNaa	Summer  =]|`|7Ds5E0SXaa	Autumn or Winter.|`|lGSUToFQaa	you know i went to school with these sisters and their names were   1 autumn tuesday  2-summer elisabeth  3-darcy falla  4-stormy rain    so i'm gonna say autumn|`|FvpktkB8aa	autumn|`|AA11828121	Summer :)    But that's my name so I guess my opinion doesn't really count!|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	wahh about spring.?  lol    i like autumn or summer.  autumns less common.|`|10YksH8caa	Autumn or Summer, not Winter.|`|kPl8TTzNaa	None.

AA12221392	when I take my daughters cell phone , she can't use the home phone iehter, she is grounded from both. If she refuses to give it up when I ask, I will call and have it shut off and she will have to buy her phone and pay her bill.     She is on my plan, and we pay the bill.     She doesn't freak out like that because she knows I will do that. The most she does is ignore for a mintue till i say phone now.     No, I would not allow her to get numbers off her phone if I had just grounded her from the cell.     When I grounded my kids from the phone , they lose internet also because we have dial up and it is using the phone. :) I know i am mean, but they will  thank me later, when they have kids...|`|vGxipYJnaa	Ours aren't teens yet but if I took our daughter's phone away I wouldn't let her use the landline either. What would be the point in taking her phone away then?    This would be an unlikely punishment in our household because we live in a city and I like to be able to contact our kids. I would ground her instead and maybe take her phone, too. It depends what she did really.
3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	I am in the same boat. I am five days late and still negative test. But it has happened to people in my family as well. My sister was 13 days late before she got a positive with her first child, my other sister didn't get  a positive with either of her kids until she was a week or more late. Test are not 100% effective, in fact research is now saying that HPTs are not even as accurate as they are rated on the box.  So just keep waiting and if in two weeks you are still getting a negative and you are still not getting your period set up a blood test. I hope it works out for the both of us. My last negative was two days ago so I plan on testing again tomorrow. They say you can retest every 2-3 days.|`|SBj7fhNvaa	I know this doesn't mean much now bc tests have improved but my mom was 8 months preggers b4 she ever got a positive so I hope you are preggers and you just got a bad round of tests :)|`|jgtfWjE4aa	if you've had neg early preg tests i'd say you're not pregnant...try in another week.|`|fYMWDQLGaa	its been only 2 days late so u can wait another 3 days, cos the 5th day the HCG levels are high. Goodluck to u..
4t6ABZcfaa	i am sorry for your loss it doesn't sound like there was anything you could have done- and nor was it your fault. Might I recomend seeking some help its always heartbreaking when a little one dies. Several years ago I lost my baby to SIDS. Time helps but you never truelly will be the same- but just keep going and moving on. And love all your little ones whether they be past present or future.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Until you accept that bad things happen you are going to continue to blame yourself.  You are not a bad mother, you are not bad or wrong for wanting to see your parents or for putting her in the car.  You will not be a bad mother to this one.  Someone else hit your car, you did not hit her, you did not slam her head into the wall, you did not starve her or hurt her in any way.  You loved her, just as you will love this one, but I think you need to seek some good counsel before the birth or you may have a hard time bonding.  Stop hurting yourself and hating yourself.  She is in heaven waiting for you and you need to start recovering so that you CAN be the best mommy you can be to this one.  God Bless You!|`|mPTBU0QDaa	No, you are not a bad mother. Accidents happen. You can live your life forever having "what if's", but the bottom line is that God is in control at all times, and for whatever reason, it was her time to die. Kids die all the time for different things. I am really sorry it happened, but definitely not your fault. There is nothign wrong with wanting to see your parents.|`|MzHwklzKaa	Bad mothers DON'T WORRY about their actions.    Bad mothers don't think twice about what happened.    Bad mothers come up with excuses and blame the innocent for things that happen.    Bad mothers deliberately harm their children for no reason.    YOU SOUND LIKE A GOOD MOTHER TO ME!!!    *****YOUR FEELINGS ARE NORMAL*********  Please get into grief counseling.  It will really help you be confident in parenting a new baby, and make peace with the past.|`|prqrQcd1aa	You are not a bad mother, a bad mother wouldn't be asking the kinds of questions that you have been asking. It's not your fault, and i'm not trying to be mean about it but i think that you should get some help to get over your grief. Especially since you are having a new baby. Babies can feel emotion, and while you are going to be happy that he is here and part of your life, you may be worried that something is going to happen to him, or that you are a bad mom, or have such depression over the loss of your other child that it is going to affect him.   I think you are a wonderful mother who cares alot, but i also think that you should get some counseling. Good luck!|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Axidents happen Amy. Stop worrying about that. Be the best mom you can to your new baby and still miss Emily. You are an okey mom! Listen to this. If the person that hit you hit a stoplight Emily'd still be here, if your parents where busy she'd still be here, if the car that hit you wasen't going the exact speed it was Emily'd be here. It's not your fault Amy!|`|LgMoGUoqaa	No if you are not at fault for the accident then no you are not a bad parent.   Somethings are out of your control.  No you will not be a bad mother to the next one.|`|fqmUca2baa	i don't think so  all things happen for a reason  you were not a bad mother  maybe it will haunt you that you blame yourself  you should not blame yourself for something that was a coincidence.
Ya1zZORIaa	I like Peyton and Shelby the best. Annette is a little old fashioned and Keegan is more of a boys name.|`|AA10223196	I like Peyton the best.

Same with Shelby Keegan .|`|foXWUdJ5aa	Its up to you, but I wouldn't have any of them - sorry but I'm being honest.  I know a Keegan and a Peyton and they're both boys, I have an Aunt Annette and she is a dragon so I guess Shelby is the best name from this short list.|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I love Peyton it's very cute!  Keegan is my next favourite it's also quite cute.  Shelby is my dog's name (who turned 18 yesterday!) so I don't like it for a little girl.  Annette sounds a bit old fashioned for me, but it's still a nice name.      :)|`|OKifJyUwaa	Ill say Shelby is a good name.  I also like Peyton.|`|rZ9QcYgeaa	Annette is the best out of those four.|`|GMgduYJZaa	I don't like them|`|MWV5yxY4aa	Peyton : )  It's adorable.|`|Uu8iCur8aa	Shelby|`|kbxJrGXoaa	I preferably like Keegan, Peyton, and Shelby!|`|NSKLYneEaa	I like them all except Keegan.

I've never met pretty girls with those names.. You need something that looks pretty when you write it. These sound like the girls are boring & gap-toothed. Sorry..|`|3uRie2GAaa	Peyton is the best :)|`|F3CMtEcraa	Annette is French for gracious and merciful.   It has a real traditional vibe but its so pretty and fun to say, I would love to be named Annette.  I think that's a lovely one.     Keegan is Irish for Decendant of the Fiery One.  That is so cool and mysterious, and I like the spelling with two Es. Yes, it is more commonly a boys name, but why let gender-connotative subjectivities be your barrier?  Besides, girls with boys names, or any kid with a creative name, is more likely to develope a fun and creative personality.      Peyton is old English for "From Old Pacca's Town" (Village of The Warrior, nobleman, fierce and relentless). It's a pretty popular name, but frankly, I'd get tired of hearing and saying it.     Shelby is also Old English for From the Town in the Hollow. It's hard for me to be unbiased about this name because everyone I've ever known named shelby has been a real *****. :) Lol, sorry. But it's a little too common, you know? The first three are definitely interesting great names.|`|UQ1d6C6Taa	i love Peyton  annette is VERY common   keegan sounds like a boi name  shelby sounds more like a nick name and yeah    peyton just perfect
AiUCeifEaa	Yes that has happened to me. I get cramps for a day and then the next day, nothing. I keep thinking my little boy is coming but he keeps tricking me!|`|siQ95I4gaa	yes that was going on with me too!!!I am curious about the answers you will get!!My baby had really gotten less active but then again there isn't much room anymore poor little girl!!!|`|V58LKhOTaa	with all 5 pregnancies anytime I would have a bought of false labor, the baby wasn't as active as usual the next few hours, maybe even into the next day. But it could be a sign of labor too, so be on the look out. Unfortunately  it is unpredictable, try eating a small meal, laying on your left side and "playing" with you stomach to see if the baby moves to be sure the baby is alright. No movement, then don't wait to see if it's labor call your dr. right away. Hope I helped!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	drink some juice or caffiene and see if the babies movement pick up, if not call your doctor and go in to hear the heartbeat.  Its unliekely that something bad happened but there is a small chance and it would make you feel better to hear that heartbeat if movement doesnt pick up.  Dont panic though babies movements change from day to day and you are probably just being more concious of it and worrying because of the cramping which could have been from anyhting, gas, babies position, pre labor contractions etc.|`|iMULlxdgaa	God you sound like me!  I'm just about 37 weeks and I haven't realyl felt my baby move too much today either.  I don't have the cramping yet but I feel nauseated (more so than in my 1st trimester) I hate this.  But if you are haivng these cramps just call your doctor cuz you could be going into labor , which is ok because your full term anyway so you'll be fine.  Just watch for bleeding...if that ahppens have someone take you right away to the L&D or call your midwife.

drI1vsJdaa	First, ask her if the ******* thing is true. Don't listen to rumors! If it is, tell her how dangerous it can be, and it can lead to horrible names, and bad diseases or pregnancy! If she still won't listen, there's nothing you can do.|`|DWl8nfyWaa	You could ask her about it.  Just say "Hey, I heard some rumors and I'm wondering if they're true..."  I have a best friend with a bad reputation too.  It's hard to hear bad things about her, but a lot of them aren't true.  Just...let her know you'll always be there for her, I guess.|`|QNnRVUoiaa	I Think You Might Want To Stay Out Of It :  But You Can :  Tell Her Parents  Tell Her Teacher  I'm Sure Her Parents Can Deal With This .|`|BYTPpcNZaa	there's nothing much you can do about it really, its her choice on what she wants to do with her life. you can speak to her about it thought, tell her how you feel about it and your views on the situation.|`|Bzy8wSsdaa	thats sick. tell how sick it is.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	Tell her what you heard about her and you wanted to know if it is true. If not, then she needs to defend herself. If it is true tell her as her friend you are worried about her and she should have more respect for herself. I know you say she is your best friend. But if she continues to act that way I would back off, as people will look at you the same way because you hang out with her. Unfortunately that is the truth.|`|1tqwkvtXaa	wow im 15 and i had a friend like that... You should try to make ur friend UNDERSTAND that no guys, not only guys but nobody will respect her if she carries on this way...i no that's such a typical thing to say but when u really really think about it its true...if u don't care to respect yourself...no one will care too either...and if she doesn't change her ways now..when she gets to high school i GUARANTEE it'll be worse for her...trust me i know...my friend was soooo close to committingg suicide because of her actions that led to her high school life having no friends and NO respect of her peers ALL BECAUSE OF A MISTAKE SHE MADE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL...at the end of the day u cant undo wat ever youve done..so talk to her seriously befor she does sum'n stupid...TRUST ME I WOULD KNOW
5cf10b9f247ea700ce15c2a77c990d36aa	Well.  I don't know, but I was allowed out on single dates at 15.  But:  That was a long time ago.  I'm really old now and wonder about how I might feel as a parent today.  I begin by thinking that I might well be fearful for my child in any public situation.   I think we live in a difficult world.  I might make a decision that allowed my child to go on a single date.  I would then spend the entire evening imagining that the worst scenario possible was occurring purely because I was not there to keep an eye on things, and because I was silly enough to trust both parties.  Homecoming that was not accompanied by tears and/or hysteria would be a HUGE relief.  It isn't just about trust.  We all believe that we have brought up our children to be sensible, and we trust them.  It is about the unknown quantity that we did not bring up, and our fear that something (it really does not matter what) might happen that hurts our child, no matter how slightly.  If that does happen, no matter how slight, then we do feel responsible for that hurt beyond any reason.  In the meantime, I am sure my child would feel that I was being unreasonable if I did I not let him/her go on their single date.  Parents, eventually, realise that they really can not do right for doing wrong!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|qIILwjsraa	im not a parent but i would say 15|`|FiUprYsvaa	14-me or the other parent dropping them off  16-driving themselves.|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	I'm not a parent but I have to wait until I'm 18 for single dates =(|`|rpsXPdFmaa	I don't know.  I never got to think of that with my daughter.  My parents refused to let us date until we could drive ourselves.|`|10YksH8caa	15|`|b5UV15gCaa	17, but have an early curfew.|`|9ffc847a086b0e1872dfa2e536bea045aa	as young as they want    in rome children would get married at 13 because their average life span was like 35    as society allowed life span to increase, we all feel the need to keep ratios the same but FCUK THAT SIHT IM SO MAD BUT I CANT SPELL SWEARS CAUSE FCKING YAHOO ANSWERS IS A ******|`|C1DsQsWlaa	I would say 16 or 17 because by then they are old enough to know what could happen to them if they aren't careful with who they are with. And now a day's, 16 and 17 year old boys are trying to talk to 13 and 14 year old girls, and we all know why.  By 16 at the least, they know what to do, while 13 and 14 year olds are like, why not, it won't hurt anybody. And there is the reason for so many teen pregnancies.|`|Xrwvu5Uraa	16 years old|`|6L9jJnchaa	Whenever you feel they are educated on birth control and are smart enough to protect themselves.  Movies and hanging out at the mall almost never mean movies and hanging out at the mall, lol.|`|mPTBU0QDaa	16 years old. That way they get used to high school and socializing in a group for a couple years and gain a little maturity before going out alone. It also prevents them from getting so attached to one boy/girl and missing out on friendships.|`|prqrQcd1aa	It would depend on the maturity level of the child honestly. If she was mature enough i'd say 15, but i'd rather she wait until 16, that's how old i was when i did it.

I love how you spelled it also.  |`|0nWsfdd9aa	Yes! I would call her RyRy!|`|niPEVKHAaa	I think it's very cute! :) Ignore the people who say it's a boy name (although I do have a little brother named ryan), If you like the name, then you should name her that. She's your child, after all. My dad's name is Sean. My friend's mom's name is Shawn. So what? I think it's cute :)|`|tlOTYiCcaa	yeahh, that's such a cute name for a girl  and i love yoru spelling, i've never seen taht|`|eeKp9mStaa	I love the spelling, but not the pronounciation :)|`|wJoMKfvqaa	I like the name Ryan for a girl, but I don't understand that spelling.  If you want a weird spelling, Ryann or Rian makes more sense. Ryein sounds like Ry-ee-in.|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Raya would be prettier for a girl. It's pronounced 'Rye-ah.' :-)|`|XzV4bUeFaa	Yes it is a nice name, but I like it spelled Ryann.|`|cErLq7f3aa	i like it spelled ryan.. or ryann|`|pLD3pYsuaa	Don't like it, sounds like a guys name|`|5bc21d2d2a57683cdbd5ef3c4094ebc4aa	No.  Ryan is a boys name and should never be used on a girl....even if you spell it differently.|`|vwTyihvvaa	Nope|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i love that spelling for a girl!!|`|NGFgKGeLaa	no, its more of a guys name.|`|XwPs0Pmnaa	like it better spelt ryan :)|`|AA10654703	Ryein is not a name.

Most peeps i know named Ryan are boys (includin my nephew) not girls so that could be why i like it better for a boy.  But if u like it for a girl then thats fine, since everyones entitled to their opinion, lol.  I do like it spelled Ryein though for a girl, it looks cute spelled like that and def girly lookin than Ryan.  Hope this helps, :D.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Ryan is cute the only problem with spelling it Ryein is people might think it spells Rain.  You could maybe go way out of the loop and do Ryanne.

4KXA5oVtaa	I'm on my second pregnancy and though I'm not a huge ShopKo fan, they have by far the largest maternity department I can find.  The selection is huge and the clothing always seems to be on clearance.  I generally shop at target but their maternity department is only a quarter of the size and 3 times the price.  Good luck!|`|iXSoX6Rnaa	brand new maternity clothes is over prices. I shop at mother hood but in the clearance rack.|`|1uRczyqjaa	hiya! The 1st link below is a really fashionable and is up to 60% off,   the 2nd link is 75% off, and kinda cool,   and the 3rd ones alright,  number 4 is not as cheap as the others but the shirts and tops are soooo cute, i'd thought it'll be nice,   5 is great and cheap!  hope this helps, good lucks with the baby! :3|`|mPTBU0QDaa	Thrift stores & craigslist! Also yahoo freecycle. I bought TONS of clothes in the last 2 weeks, all for under $150. I'm talking like 6 pairs of pants, probably 15 shirts, about 5 dresses. LOTS of clothes. They were all about $5. And cute! Some of them were from the clearance racks at Old Navy, Kohls, and Target.     Not sure about baby clothes, except for thrift stores. I don't have a baby yet. But thrift stores are awesome. They have some of the nicest clothes, and usually all for under $5.|`|59M4xUwXaa	I recently went to Sears and Target and all of their baby clothes are on sale!! I bought a bunch of stuff. Also at Sears they offer a Kids Clothing club and they send you coupons to use. Walmart has some cute stuff that is cheap and made by the company that makes Carters. As for maternity clothes...that can be tricky. Sometimes Motherhood Maternity have awesome sales. Their maternity jeans are super comfy and around 20 bucks. Target also has some cut Maternity clothes. OH if you have a Burlington Coat Factory near you...definitely check out their baby and maternity clothes...huge selection and super cheap!!!|`|6e72fe5eaebe0f66961aa766d452c09faa	the only place i have found is ebay or peacocks|`|7FvVx3kVaa	There is craigs list, (whatever town you live in)freecycle, e-bay, thebabybin.com, BizRate.com, www.bunnycreek.com,     This one right here is a good one. They are used clothes but still in good condition and cheap --->www.baby-place.com/second_hand.php      www.gently-used.com    Hope, that was some help for you!|`|O20eJDd4aa	An answer from the UK, if that's any good: H&M do nice and not too expensive maternity wear. Also charity shops are good places to check out.   Join your local freecycle group (check freecycle.org) and see if there are any on offer or post a 'wanted'.  And see how you can make what you have last, I managed to wear some of my trousers all the way through pregnancy by fixing the 'unable to button up' problem with an elastic band looped through button hole and onto button. Buy some long t-shirts/ vests that you can wear under most clothes to cover your belly and the top part of your trousers or tie a scarf around to cover the gap. Buy/Wear cardigans/ jackets that you don't need to button up so they can be worn whether you're pregnant or not.  For baby clothes, check out markets as well and do buy a size up, they will last longer and yes, babies grow so fast, they will soon enough fit! And don't buy too much before your new arrival, I would suggest about 5-7 babysuits (underwear) and about 5 all-in ones (long sleeves, legs with feet), depending on the season. These you will use most for the first period and you will probably receive more dressy clothes as gifts once the baby is there.  One last tip, consider washable nappies, they will save you so much money over the years that you can spend on other things, and you do your baby's bit for the environment.  Good luck and all the best!|`|nPZi0wzYaa	k mart, walmart babys r us

Ethan James is my favourite out of the boys, Ethan is my brothers name but his middle name is Robert.      :)|`|lIDCEiWuaa	Alexis Grace is a pretty name for a girl  Alexis Jordan not so pretty for a girls name or a guys   Gracie Anna doesnt really go together  Gracie Nicole is great....i love it  Ethan James - is just perfect for a guys names....i love it  Jackson Thomas not so much a great name  and Taylor Matthew is a wonderful name for a boy but i think u should take out the extra t and make it Taylor Mathew   :D|`|29GAXVUHaa	i like          - alexis grace         - gracie nicole         - taylor matthew|`|7FvVx3kVaa	Jackson Thomas or Alexis Jordan.....

I tend to click on these and cringe while I am waiting for the page to come up (I know I should not, but it is like I have not control over it LOL).  The last one wanted to name her daughter Basset or Vegas (holy crap!).    Anyways... back to yours.  I like Ethan James and Alexis Jordan.|`|WfmHoFHbaa	Alexis Grace is beautiful. so feminine and elegant|`|eyXXPvfnaa	I like Alexis Grace and Jackson Thomas. Also Taylor Mathew. Overall, great choices for baby names, very tasteful :).
eemmWU0Haa	Take a blood test it will set your mind at ease!|`|Y9IoElMBaa	This is indeeds sounds like your very pregnant to me; especially with the metallic taste in your mouth, spotting like that is common for some women during early pregnancy, when you tested it could have been that you were too early to tell yet, but also with the bleeding it could be throwing it off, as with what happened with a friend of mine when she was pregnant with her little girl. My suggestion is to go see your doctor and they have ways to tell, through things like blood tests and ultrasound.   My best of wishes to you.
GMrtEYj6aa	angelina why because angelina jolie is my idol.    rachael because that's my grandaughter name.|`|4axExUPyaa	Angeline  Gabrielle|`|mZi7R0Enaa	Angelina is so feminine and has a great NN Angie!|`|DP48dIxhaa	Gabrielle is my favorite.

ji8PuePIaa	yes. the book was much more magical and raced your imagination. By making the movie they just ruined the magic of the book.|`|9sj4vr4faa	Yeah i agree.  I knew it wouldn't be a great movie, its hard to make such an amazing book into a movie.  I felt like the actors were very awkward with each other.  When Jacob is showing Bella her truck and they are talking it seemed awkward, and like an unprofessional youtube video.  I didn't like how they added stuff, like Edward almost killing Bella by draining her, cause I thought he stopped sooner.  It just was a weird movie, I still loved parts of it though.|`|lsrCb2vfaa	i was too. i was expecting more. it was still good, just not as good as i was expecting it to be. they have a new director this time around, so it'll hopefully be better.|`|MBSrbJuAaa	I was quite disappointed too. I was sad they left out sooooo many parts!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|2lByIoqGaa	The book is ALWAYS better than the movie... Just a fact of life. But sometimes the movies are good, but the book is ALWAYS better. They just can't fit all that happened in the book in the movie cuz that would make for a VERY long movie lol and probably cost tons more $$$. The books are better cuz they have more details, and more situations that may not seem important for movies, but are in the development and understanding of characters.|`|3914f07763f3427f6a3a80bad01d0e3caa	I saw the movie first and it made me enjoy the book a lot more.    I liked the movie a lot more then the book though. I realized Twilight is nothing compared to the other three books.|`|yIdwMPsoaa	i heard it sux's monkey balls!!|`|Osn1xpu6aa	who else thought the twilight series was a huge fail?|`|gILygKvRaa	I LOVED it! I LOVED the book even more. but i still liked it|`|DWl8nfyWaa	I thought the book was okay, but I thought the movie was going to be waaaaay better.  I didn't really enjoy it either.  Everything just seemed so awkward...like, their conversations and stuff just didn't seem to flow right.  People don't have one word conversations with each other.|`|XCcfh8LOaa	I was very disappointed in the movie. Everyone was like "It's the best movie ever!!!!!" Then I saw it and wasn't. Also I started the book like 2 weeks ago.... SO MUCH BETTER.|`|H0sPCJQPaa	i liked it but your right it didn't do the book justice.|`|ddP3klT3aa	I haven't read or seen it. But the book is almost always better than the movie in any situation. Except Girl Interrupted. But any other book I read was much better than the movie.

One of my favorite names. But Ethan, Easton, Nathaniel, and Nate are also similiar.|`|LZLilTe8aa	i like the name Evan   but i really love  Easton|`|agTCqkLDaa	I think you guys should find a first name that you're BOTH crazy about so neither Evan nor Nathan.  That's my opinion.|`|23Zz2yrPaa	Nathaniel Marcus|`|BAjc1fZNaa	ethan, Nicholas.....eason, easton, nathanial, Nick, etc.  i like evan but it sound like a last name hardly no one has it but nathan is common and there alot of nathans that i know nathan r nathan s....  get the point but i gotta go with your husband  sorry   =]   Evan Mark*
NFaa4dsHaa	You should go. I mean would you rather leave her unsupervised with him? I think not.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	tell him you will only go if he doesn't accept all of her attention and thats if you agree with that and if he doesn't accept then explain how much the girl affects you|`|xwtpvK9maa	wear something really pretty  and enjoy yourself  predend she's not there  and keep thinking ur his gf and not her. ur bf likes you and not her.  go to the party and have fun! :)|`|opmKHKFqaa	I think you should go because some girl should NOT stop you from having a good time with your boyfriend.  Also if you think about it - if your not there that girl might try to do something so it's best if your there.  && Remember to enjoy yourself and just remember he is your boyfriend|`|jLYuqk1Jaa	you should go cuz he invited you!! and he wants to have a good time with you so i would go if i was you and have fun|`|nEDv5Qwaaa	you def need to go.  do not let your guard down and think she can get away with it.  if she does try stufff when your there, do not get mad because she will sense it. this is going to sound kiddish but you need to act like it doesnt bother you and you need to give him all attention and do things for him so she sees.  sit close to him and if you know she is watching sneak in for a peck on the lips.  do what ever you have to, but do notttttttttt let her win by not going and do not let her get to you while you are there|`|AmqQ9it5aa	GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO    That is your boyfriend and he wants you to come. Don't let her ruin your time. He is into you so don't worry just stay away from her and tell him to blow her off when she does something out of order.    If you don't she wins and your boyfriend is upset that you didn't come.|`|6lSbmXunaa	You should go.  He's YOUR boyfriend, you shouldn't have to miss out on something with him because another girl is trying to steal him away from you.  That would be like giving in haha Seriously just go.  If she starts doing something you don't like and your boyfriend doesn't say anything, pull him aside and tell him it hurts you.  Or just like make out with him in front of her haha that'll get her mad.|`|W6bKNcRjaa	You should definitely go.|`|UbPHTddHaa	remember youre his gf not her so just go and enjoy yourself and completely ignore her dont pay attention to her dont even look at her trust me that bothers your enemies jaja.|`|QNnRVUoiaa	You should go cuz he's your boyfriend ! and if she does something you stand up for it . and remember he's YOUR boyfriend|`|BYTPpcNZaa	you should go. hes your boyfriend so how can you get jealous, hes with you. make her jealous, haha|`|Bzy8wSsdaa	id go if i were you. she's obviously jealous. like my good friend has a HUGE crush on my boyfriend and i am the jealous type too but if you just ignore her, it could be fun.

When I was in 8th grade which was only last year this was nothing like this. But people do what they want to do & as long as you do what you think right it doesn't matter.|`|MIUzgwsTaa	It only shows that most students nowadays don't go to school for education.  I mean really think about it,  Girls have to make sure they have the cutest outfits on and their hair is really perfect  Boys have to make sure they have the newest pairs of sneakers before school start back  Girls have to make sure they are really popular and have the cutest boyfriend  Boys have to make sure they get alot of girls  When all along they are going to school to make sure they have a suitable career in the future   But their only worried about what they are going to wear TODAY  Who are they going to get with TODAY  *sighs* and *shakes heads*|`|DWl8nfyWaa	That's...inappropriate.

That's putting it eloquently.|`|AA10223196	She should get a medal for being the most ignorant woman alive.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	I can't understand why everyone cares so much....  I mean, yes, successfully giving birth to 8 children is a huge deal.  Other than that though, everything else is her business, not ours.|`|prqrQcd1aa	I agree with Glenna here, not our place to judge her, none of our business...    If people put as much energy into other things such as : economics failing, global warming, decline of society, homeless, vets with problems, and so on, then we'd have a better world to live in.    Why are we a society that is fed negativity all the time?|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Good job! You ended the madness.|`|q7Y06Xxcaa	The news is an unreliable source of information for any story. Let alone a story like this one. Always has been and always will be. Anyone who believes otherwise is naive.    I personally don't believe anyone should be allowed to have more than 4 kids anymore. Unless, of course, their finances allow it. This is silliness.    At a time where the economy is failing, wars are raging, and people are literally starving to death, while others live in overcrowded cities,  the last thing we need is a family of 14 living off the system. That is not evening touching on the subject that these are unnatural births. For the people who really need these types of treatments, it is worth it. But there is always those who go overboard. As is with this particular case.   But it is too late now the kids are here, can't take it back, but maybe if enough people complain about it, it won't happen anymore.|`|phAqOpzZaa	WHO CARES!!!
AA11719145	You have a cold in your nose. Or you have an upper respiratory infection. It it's a cold, there is not much you can do. Modern science can put a rover on Mars, but cannot cure the common cold. If it's an upper respiratory infection, a doctor can prescribe an antibiotic.    For now, soak a hand towel in very very warm water, lie down on your bed or the sofa, and place the towel on your face around your nose and sinus area....of course....leave room to breath. When the towel cools off, reheat it with more water and keep it on your face. This will help with the pressure and stuffiness.     When your mom gets home, she'll get you some meds or some other treatment she decides on.|`|3kNeWYvdaa	Do not tilt your head back! Put petroleum jelly on affected areas on your nose and take a nap! You got no medicine so that's all you can do drink tea might help|`|1hciyvKdaa	Go to a neighbors and borrow some, ask a friend to bring you some, or go to bed and rest and hopefully you can sleep through alot of this. Drink plenty of water each hour, a half cup min one cup is better.|`|us1ca2qIaa	You have a cold, and the sneezing is making you raw.|`|WpaQKpckaa	CHILL OUT. It's just a cold. I am right now dealing with the worst sore throat and I'm so congested its not even funny. Make yourself some tea,, lots of tea. And drink while hot. You have to have some cold syrup or pills in your house, look for them. Don't drink anything cold!|`|CoTsKzPFaa	Go to sleep.|`|prqrQcd1aa	You sound like you have a sinus infection... this is really gross but it works for me.  Take some salt, like 1/2 of a teaspoon, add it in some warm water, about a cup...  Drink some of this with out swallowing, and tip your head down over the bathroom sink so the salt water will run through your nose. It will clear out your sinuses until mom gets there with the tylenol!|`|sjkfjTBdaa	Stop wasting your time on here, i doubt anyones a medical professional.  GO TO A DOCTOR|`|KOwzDLPdaa	You have a viral sinus infection, drink hot tea, or boil water, put it in a bowl and put your face over the water, NOT IN IT, and drape a towel over your head to trap the steam in and inhale.

Shut off the flame when it boils. Cover your head with a towel...be careful the water's hot...over the pot and inhale the steam. If you have Wick's vapor rub you can put some under your nose and on your chest. You want to break up the congestion.  Feel better.....|`|ucYwexwJaa	You're dehydrated from your cold symptoms, that's why you're bleeding.  You need beer and lots of it, it'll help with the headache and the pain associated with colds.  I'm usually feeling better within 24 hours if I drink a 12 pack.|`|IdwbQTIaaa	Lay down, try to get some rest.  If you have no cold medicine, theres nothing else you can really do.  Take a hot shower and breathe in the steam.|`|9MAgrGAMaa	turn the heat up high and get under as many blankets as possible ... sweat it out!|`|vQE281kRaa	Drink orange juice or eat oranges. Lie down and rest.

It actually makes it worst. For the headache, try a hot shower. The steam will help. As for the sneezing, medicine  is  pretty much the only option. I heard that rubbing vick's vapor on your feet and putting socks on can actually help when you have a cold. I don't know how, but it really does work. I hope you feel better! Have a good weekend!|`|7kvTHzj0aa	if your nose starts bleeding because of sneezing too much, its likely that a small bloodvein popped in your nose. its happened to me before. lost like 2 cups of blood from it. but dont panic, lol. Dont take any aspirin. aspirin makes blood vessels expand, making your bloody nose worse. just shove a tissue in it for now. theres nothing else you can do without any medication except to just tough it out. although most people say to rest, i found that physical exercise helps me get better.|`|8ccc79ebd93ea8a828606869e111cc6daa	Okay, first off calm down. It just sounds like a cold.    Take a washrag and run it under cold water, put it over your eyes and head, it should release the tension    Clean your nose, then put some vasaline around the nostrils it should help it from cracking which sounds why its bleeding. Then, if you can help it, don't blow your nose. The more you blow it the more swelled it becomes.    Try to lay down and relax. Maybe put some vix vapor rub on your chest or take a bath. It really should help!|`|Ymx4Im2baa	you probabally have some allergies going on. This is the season. Take some ice in a bag and put it on the back of your neck, this should stop the bleeding, and put pressure on the upper part of your nose. If your headache gets worse put ice on your forehead and move it around to the sides about 20 minutes each. Take care dear.|`|7H2tRvDVaa	If you have peppermint oil. Place a drop on a warm towel and put it on your forehead. Do not use too much or put the towel over your eyes. IT WILL BURN!     If not, turn the shower on hot, sit in the bathroom with the door closed for about 15 to 10 minutes. You are probably dry. This will help bring moisture into your sinus cavities and ease the headache. Then lie down with a cold towel over your head.    Hope you feel better.|`|kqaDc64saa	OH wait...i had the exact same thing happen to me a couple years ago so i killed myself and wala...no more cold
eV7rtxmuaa	Your wondering if "you" should be thinking about the morning after pill? This is something you need to discuss with your wife... And perhaps you both need to take extra precations instead of possibly killing an innocent baby if she were pregnant & taking the morning after pill.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	She has the same chance of getting pregnant taking the green pill as any of the other colored pills in the packet.

9zwSclnLaa	My parents talk to me about internet safety.  Our computer is in an open room in our house [in the family room] where anyone can walk by and see what I am doing.  It is not hidden behind closed doors.  It is possible for parents to control this issue.    My parents have never used any unusual tactics.  If something weird comes up on the history they confront me about it.  I know they moniter so I don't do anything stupid to make them do that though.|`|58eFDvwsaa	omg i absolutley hate parents like you. if you are in the adolesent section, then im assuming your kids are older. give them their space and just trust them to go on the internet. if you give them limits then they are just going to test you|`|7Ds5E0SXaa	Well there is a way you can check your kids past. I can't tell you how because my computer is a 1996 or 1998 Dell computer so mine is different.|`|M6b9kcBxaa	If They are old enough to get on the internet  They are old enough to make their own desisions  Leave them alone and trust them|`|8TW00N9Daa	Keep a Computer in the public areas of the house.

Know what they surf.|`|FiUprYsvaa	When I have kids, I am going to educate them on how the internet CAN be dangerous if they mis-use it.   I will teach them it is not wise to meet people on the internet, give out information on the internet, or doing anything like send nude photos.    I will let them know most people you'd meet from online aren't such great people and that they should use the internet for talking to their real life friends, keeping in touch with old ones, music, reading the news, things like youtube.     I will have blocks on porn.   They will each have their own desktop, like you know the icons on windows for each person, they'll have their own to log into.   And each one will be custom set to their age and everything.     Since the blocks will be there and my kids will be smart enough to not give out information to strangers online, I won't be perched on the back of their chair, i'll be around the house.|`|ji8PuePIaa	Go to parental guidence. Talk to your kids and inform them of what happens. You also dont want to be in their buisness all the time too. I myself am a teenager, but i know. If your kids are doing something bad, let them do it and pay the consiquences. But just monitor to make sure it is nothing thats dangerous. Everythings not bad. It all depends how smart you are. Like myspace can be safe if you just use control settings and you dont talk to anyone outside you know. just teach your children the right rules and theyll be fine ;)

She would always draw me pictures and leave me notes when I was a chaperon at a little girls' camp. Me and another girl always had to check how good of a cleaning job the little girls did in their cabins, and she would always leave us notes... she was great. :)    Riley -- I guess I like it better for a girl... i really don't like it at all, but it's way popular for a girl, so it would almost seem embarrassing to name a boy this while it maintains the feminine popularity.     Sam --- Boy, definitely. I really don't like the name, but I know too many female jerks with this name.    Jesse -- Girl. I don't like Jessica at all, but if Jessie is in no way short for Jessica, I would be fine with it. Plus, I know a creeper boy named Jessy... so I don't really like it for a boy.    Peyton -- Girl, I guess. It's another name that I don't really like... but it's also popular for girls. So it has the same case as Riley.    Bailey -- Girl. Once again, it's popular for girls... I do like this name, but possibly only because it's my last name.     Rory -- Girl. I know a really strange man named Rory...which makes it all the more attractive for a girl in my opinion. But Aurora is also too popular.     Casey -- Boy. All of the male Casey's I know are amazingly fun. I love them.     Lee -- Boy. It would seem strange for the first name if a girl... I can only picture it as a first name on an asian person, anyway...    Taylor -- Girl. I don't really know why... Possibly because of the many female Taylor's I know.    Hayden -- Boy. I really don't like this name, especially not for a girl. Mostly becaue Hayden Panettierre is pretty idiotic to me.     Dakota -- Girl. I don't like it for a boy, also because of people I know...     Noah -- Boy! It's almost the same case as Riley and Peyton, only it's just extremely popular for boys, not girls. Plus, it seems like the only people that would use it for a girl would be the ones obsessed with Miley Cyrus, seeing as "Noah" is her little sister's name.     Devon -- Well, Devon to me looks like "de VON"...but I assume it's "dev in". I like Devin for a boy more than a girl... Probably because it's my cousin's name. He's a bit crazy, but I love him anyway.    Reese -- umm...well, when spelt like that, I would use it for a girl... So I pick girl. It's another name that I would never use, but it seems slightly more girly to me, I guess.    Sage -- Girl. It would seem strange on a boy... I know quite a few girls named Sage...and strangely enough, they're named after "Sagebrush", the weird and not so attractive plant... but it's everywhere around here, so somehow, people here like it as a name.    Cameron -- Neither....but I'll pick boy. I like "Cami" for a girl, but there are many other names that "Cami" could be used for.     Jamie -- Girl. I knew a jerkie boy named Jamie.... I also know a girl named Jamie, but she's pretty awesome. So she makes me biased about the name. :)    I enjoyed this, it was great. I kind of laughed at the person who told you to edit this... I found it perfectly clear, and I'm sure most other people did, also. It was fun.    -- Amy|`|8rSoZxJTaa	Alex-boy  Riley-girl  Sam-boy  Jesse-either  Peyton-girl  Bailey-girl  Rory-girl  Casey-girl  Lee-boy  Taylor-girl  Hayden-girl  Dakota-boy  Noah-boy  Devon-boy  Reese-either  Sage-girl  Cameron-girl  Jamie-girl|`|dvht9KlIaa	Peyton is a BOYS NAME    growing up, i knew a girl named Peyton Caylie Rochelle.

Peyton Caylie was a straight A student, and make the varsity Volleyball and soccer teams in her freshman year..    she had everything. but she hated her name and was teased a lot by people who didnt know her or were jelos. (payton is one of those names that are very easy to make jokes by) her parents wanted her to keep being called payton. kids are cruel, the extent of the jokes are horrendes, and i am about to cry writing this.  at the age of 14, she commited suicide by hanging herself outside her church. she left a note that i wish i could share with you..it would definatly make you think twice about naming a baby girl Peyton.  she would have been 17, and getting her driving lisense this year (something we both looked forward to) i miss her so much. dont do that to your child.|`|xS5Uqgnuaa	Alex- Boy, unless you used it as alexandra  Riley-girl  Sam- Samantha (girl)  Jesse- Boy  Peyton- Girl  Bailey-girl  Rory-girl  Casey-girl  Lee- Boy  Taylor-both  Hayden-girl  Dakota-girl  Noah-boy (from the notebook, and an adorable name!)

n6XYYyoLaa	has she been in the crib any other time? maybe give her time to explore and play in the crib first, then start taking naps in there...my baby likes a fan for white noise and a womb bear....works every time and she's seven mos old...you may have to do what  i call 'modified fussing it out'....like modified crying it out...once u put her down for nap, all needs are met..she has to go to sleep to get out....you can go in to reassure her, help her find passy, whatever, but stretch out the time in between and don't talk to her, make eye contact or pick  her up....you have to be consistent; pick her up once and u take 3 steps back....and it will be harder next time by far, bc she knows if she steps it up a notch, she gets out....if she needs a diaper change for some reason, do it with her lying in the crib, quick, quiet, and back out...|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Have you tried white noise in her bedroom?  There might be ambient noise that's disturbing her.  We live in a city and there's a lot of street noise so we have a radio set to static in my son's room to block it out.|`|iTXnHiwTaa	make the crib a fun place to be. during the day, put her in there with lots of toys and leave her for 10 min or so... and maybe increase (so long as she happy playing alone). Then use cues, like a lullaby song, or white noise when she sleeps on floor or couch etc. and use these same noises to cue her to sleep in a crib once you've consistently used them elsewhere for maybe a week or so.|`|TVC3mAP7aa	Routine is the thing that worked the best for us to get our little guy to sleep in his crib.  We follow the same routine every night...(bath, playtime, eat, crib) and he will usually put himself to sleep now after we put him in the crib (he's 9 months now).  I think we started the routine around 5 or 6 months.  It really helps them out to know what's coming next.  Other things that come to mind...make sure the room is the correct temperature and very dark, if possible.  We use a sleep sack and that really cues him that it's bedtime.  A transitional item would also be helpful...a blankie, doll, paci, etc.  Transitional items allow them to self-soothe if they wake up when you're not there.  Good luck!|`|PDHCOrOSaa	white noise!

She said he attempted suicide. His not died|`|gwUMipsUaa	This will be hard for you to understand, but a guy who loves his gal doesn't put her through hell like this.    Suicide is a very selfish act.      What you can do is learn from this.  Make yourself the best you that you can be.  You can counsel others as well if they are seriously thinking suicide.  Counsel them to get professional help.  Good luck.    Edit: If the guy is still alive, you really don't want someone with mental problems to father your kids.  If he's alive, tell him to get help first, and then you'll see about taking this further.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Wow, that's too bad. Maybe you can explain to them that he needs a friend, obviously, and that you want to be there for him. It's not like his suicidal feelings are going to rub off on you or something; what are they afraid of?     Before sneaking around or doing something that could get you really into trouble, I would try talking to them. This guy needs help big time, and they're turning him away, in a sense, which is sad and only reinforces his feelings of self-doubt.|`|NjDYAEbHaa	so is Matt dead, you didnt say it, you said he tried once before.  but im sorry if he is, i lost my girlfriend at the time 2 years ago (our sophomore year of high school) in a car accident. I was devistated and didn't go to school for almost a month. but eventually you deal and everyday it gets easier because its one more day your closer to seeing them. It also helps to talk to someone, i went to a therapist for almost a year.    If your talking about dating, just meet him after school like maybe 2 times a week and tell your parents that you have to say for extra help in math. Work things out and eventually your parents will accpect him because you love him.|`|YNcsGi82aa	see him secertly don't listen your parents|`|gILygKvRaa	Wow. That's so sad. Honey, I'm so sorry.

You need a healthy relationship at your age, life at your age is though enough as it is. Don't ever try to sneak out or lie to your parents, believe me, they will find out.

He doesn't sound like a healthy influence in your life and even though you felt "in love" with him take it from a married 29 year old woman... that "in love" feeling ALWAYS passes and then you have to work on having a real relationship.    Someone who isn't mentally healthy can NOT have a healthy relationship.  Right now you should be hanging out with guys who have good ambition and who don't have baggage like this guy has and he needs to work on himself before he can be healthy enough to be a good partner for someone else.    This too shall pass.  *hugs*
KDb96QS7aa	I really feel your pain! And I only have one kid! My husband works 80 hrs a week (medical resident) so when it comes to caring for the kid - it's basically me.  We've used CIO, and it worked awesome. We had to do it twice because our son got sick.  Both times it took 2 nights, and on the 3rd night he would go right to sleep no problem, and wake at 4-8 hour intervals to eat never waking me more than once at night to go and nurse him.  We tried the "chair" method as you call it (I believe it's actually termed "extinction with parental presence," and the Ferber method is called "graduated extinction") but that actually seemed to make him cry longer. A friend of mine did try extinction with parental presence and had success with it. She told me it took her about a month before she was completely out of the room right away after putting her baby down.    Watch your children - whatever works for them is what works for them. Every child is different. But, you absolutely need sleep as much as you need to eat, so never feel guilty if your child has to cry a little before learning how to fall asleep if it means you don't kill them in a car accident the next day.  I have to say (I'm gonna get crap for this!) I really don't think the crying hurts them. If you leave a kid at daycare, you think they're not left crying frequently? Even litters of puppies - they're crying all the time. Yes, it is awful to listen to (why I did it when my husband was home to help and I could leave and not listen to it - I wanted to cry every time!).  Anyway - just go with your gut and keep yourself healthy. You can't take care of two kids if you aren't taking care of yourself.  Edit:  Jillian, to clarify, I did NOT let my son cry while he was sick. That was the REASON for having to do it twice. He got sick, so I started picking him up with every little whimper. When he got better, he expected the treatment he got while he was sick.   I'll say it again, what works for some babies won't work for others. Which is why mom always knows best in this situation - she knows her kids and situation better than any of us.|`|8yTP3jO8aa	I answered this before, but no, I don't think you'll lose steam.  Yes, they'll both probably learn at different paces, but I think you'll be okay.    Maybe you can try setting some small goals for them that build on each other, then work on one at a time.  Rather than just focusing on "I want them to fall asleep on their own", which seems like a huge undertaking, focus just on one part first.     That might be something for you "I want to be able to help both of them get to sleep at the same time".  Or, it might be something like "I want them to be happy snuggling with a substitute comfort object at bedtime", or "I want them to be happy laying in their cribs awake at bedtime while I sit next to them", or whatever.    Then you can move on to what follows next.  After they are happy snuggling with a stuffed toy at night and you (as an example, you don't have to do that...) then you can focus on "now I want them to snuggle with their stuffy instead of me for part of our snuggle time".    I know it sucks to have overly tired babies because then it is just that much harder to get them to sleep afterwards.    I am pretty against letting babies and even toddlers cry them out if you can help them.  It just isn't nice, to begin with, and it can make the problem worse if  they start to not like bedtime because of it.    Honestly, though, letting them cry it out can work as long as you helping would make them worse, not better.  If they are just so super tired that they aren't responding to you helping them, and you helping them makes them more upset, it's okay to let them cry and work it out themselves if they won't let you help them.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	This sounds really tough.  Have you considered putting each twin on their own schedule?  One twin goes to bed on the early side, one on the slightly later side?  I mean, there's some potential issues there too, but maybe it would help.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	sure it won't kill your child to cry unless your child has asthma and you didn't know it and they have a severe asthma attack over it. However, crying releases a stress hormone in your brain called cortisol and too much cortisol can effect brain growth and development. this often may lead to chemical imbalances and emotional problems such as bi-polar disorder and failure to thrive and many other things     Gron0083- you let your son cry while he was sick- how horrid mothers are suppose to hold their babies when they are sick     have you tried wearing a sling while putting the other to sleep and maybe the one will fall asleep in the sling|`|68c6B8dRaa	Do you and your husband not have a reliable manager who can handle the restaurant at night for a bit while this works itself out? If not, maybe this is the time to hire somebody?    ...do you live near family? I am not crazy-crazy close to my mother but if I'd been in your shoes I definitely would've relied on her for help.     We had terrible sleep-fuss around 10mo and it went away in a matter of weeks. If there's a way to ride it out, ride it out.|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	I sit in the chair in the room.  I have a 11 month old, and I have been doing this for a few months now. And she really likes it, knowing that I am right there. I will first, sit in the chair with her, read her a book, give her the night bottle and rock and cuddle her, get her to wind down and relax.Then I give her many kisses and say I love you and good night and lay her in the crib. She tosses and turns and gets up and lays back down, and gets up. I softly say to her...lay down baby is night time, and she will lay down and look at me...this goes on for about 10 mins to maybe 20 at times. I don't have a light on, I crack the door. But I sit there until she is out for the count. It takes some time and in the beginning, I would pick her up after she would cry, and love on her again. After about 2-3 nights of that, she got used to the fact that mommy was still right there.Then it was slight whimpers. Now she just plays a tiny bit in there and then she falls asleep.   After we started doing that routine, she sleeps through the night and wakes very happy and alert.   But I would never just let her CIO. I didn't even let it happen for more then 2 mins. But that is what worked for me. I hope you find something that will work for all 3 of you..Good Luck!      I know that I would rather be in the room with my LO then leave the room and hearing her cry..She finds comfort in knowing mommy is right there with her, to hold her when she gets upset..But every parent is different, and some things may work for some and the same may not work for the rest and that's ok..no one said we all had to do things the same way as everyone else.|`|oIFMohfUaa	Here is my advice...and it's worked for everyone I've suggested it for! For nap or night time.    Doing this at this early age is SO MUCH EASIER than at a later age! Believe me on that one!     I would do your nightly routine to ready them for bed. Routine at bedtime is a good thing...it gets them in mindset. Calm, quiet and maybe the lights down a little. Cuddle, sing, read, etc.  Kiss them, put them in their bed(s).     After putting them down, hum a little as you walk away. "Good night, mommy loves you!" (Try not to look at those pleading puppy eyes!)    DON'T pick them up again. If you do, they will expect you to pick them up everytime.     Go in every few minutes, sooth, sing to them, pat their back, and leave again. Repeat this...sometimes many times.     They may get more than fussy before the first night is over. (if they fuss at all. Sometimes it is pretty easy.)    The idea is that they will learn you ARE there, but that you are NOT going to pick them up. They may think that if they can't see or feel you, that you are actually gone. This will reassure them...I think that's the reason for the chair in the room.  Maybe a chair you can sit in, pat their backs, then slowly move away.  I can tell you that seeing you makes it harder...on all of you!     After a few times, try to hum or sing from the hallway instead of actually going in.     It may take a couple of nights for them to learn to sooth theirselves to sleep.     Be strong! It's never easy, but it's so much better to do NOW!     My pediatritian said once..."Think of it as exercising the lungs and getting them all cleared out and filled with oxygen for a good, restful sleep."  It isn't killing them to cry...even hard for a few minutes!  My oldest son could not go to sleep if he didn't!  He needed to get rid of the days tension!    Good luck...|`|rFtKFp03aa	Yes sleep is very important.. I have sleep trained multiple children.. including twins and triplets...     I would think your kids are too young to understand the you sitting in the chair thing.. that is for kids that are older and are scared to be alone.. with your guys.. they will just be confused and upset that you aren't holding them..     If you are doing CIO you have to do it all the way you can't just do it one night, for some naps, or only during certain times... that confuses the older babies.     After 3 or 4 nights of CIO the babies should get a hang of it, especially doing it for naps as well..     Try putting them to bed earlier.. before they get over tired ..     They should be sleeping 12 hours straight.     Best Wises     ( Also Refer to a book called Baby Wise, it has lots of good options and opinions to read about )|`|AA12243380	I probably would have tried it in your situation.  Luckily one of my twins was really good at self-soothing by that age so I didn't have to soothe them both.    Do what you have to, mama.  Good luck!!!!      ETA-I would only do it as a last resort.  If you could afford to hire someone or if your husband can afford to take time off from work then try that first but I couldn't have afforded that myself.    I had another idea... what about putting them down with a bottle?  I know that's supposed to be a no-no but I put my twins down with bottles from like 11 months until 18 months.  Now we put them down with sippy cups.  They don't fall asleep with them in their mouths.        Landon's Mama-You're lucky.  If my babies had only cried for like 10 minutes I'd be for it too.  lol  My babies weren't that easy.  I don't even count that as cry-it-out.  ;-D|`|FLpMShKNaa	Letting a baby CIO it out sucks, but at 10 mos. a schedule is good, and my son was happier once we got him on a schedule. I haven't heard of the chair method but the healthy sleep habist, healthy child worked for me and many others-the author comes off as a jerk, but he knows his stuff, has researched his positions unlike Dr. Sears who says a baby who cries will be scarred for life with no research to back it up. And sleep is so important, you are right. As you said its a hot topic and moms will disagree, but if you are like me youa re on this site to hear other mom's experiences and I am sharing mine-my son was SO much happier on a schedule.|`|hrMhhB4Saa	im all for CIO-- on with the thumbs down    my son has been very easy we started cio at 41/2 months when we took the binki away. the longest he ever cried for was 12 minutes. but we would let him cry for 3 minutes, go in and rub his belly without picking him up.. walk out, next time let him cry for 5 minutes, go in rub his belly and walk out. next time 7 minutes and so on. just to reassure him that if he needed us we would be there.by the 3rd day of cio he was asleep with no fuss at all. he's 81/2 months old and never cries before bed
70kh6VSoaa	how old are you? Dont think your pregnant i hate hearing that crap take a test or go to the FREE clinics all over the us and know if your pregnant or not....second if he has already lies to you why are you asking but if ya'll are just friends whats it matter don't be a crazy stalker type or he will just keep doing it guys don't want that kinda girl|`|6UmjlJHTaa	?
TVC3mAP7aa	My son slept great through months 2 and 3, but started teething during his fourth month, and it really messed with his sleep.  It's good to remember that most babies don't just sleep through the night and stay that way, it will vary as events change in their lives (like teething!).  Many babies will sleep through the night for awhile and then seem to regress for a while.  This is actually very normal, STTN isn't usually a linear process.  My son is now sleeping through for the most part at 9 months, but I'm not getting my hopes up that it'll last forever!  Good luck!|`|871bf9188469fa10404159e74fc6200caa	My first was 10 months and my second is almost 4 months and still gets up 2-3 times. 7 weeks is extremely young if he does before 1 it probably will not be for a few more months|`|74pfB2Bnaa	My daughter is 10 months old and I'm still waiting for her to sleep through the night. The good news it, with time the sleep interruptions become much easier to bear.    The best you can do now is to take naps, while your son is asleep during the day.|`|0viZhxi6aa	My son is wierd. He has slept through the night almost since we brought him home (at 5 weeks old) But during growth spurts he wakes up once or twice. He is now 7 months and sleeps from 11 pm until 7 or 7:30 am. Hope you get some sleep soon!    ***Oh I almost forgot -- my doc says they usually start when they are around 12 lbs!***|`|Om1yADWRaa	keep dreaming! sorry to say but you won't get solid sleep for quite a while breast is best so try and keep at it if its really getting you down ask your partner to get baby out of bed and give them to you. mine is 1 on 19th and is only just sleeping through but all babies are different there is no harm in putting them in a routine mind bath breast bed something simple it might just help hope you get some sleep!|`|Tm1HRIl2aa	My son was 14 weeks.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	My son is 5mon.  For about the last month, he has been sleeping much more consistently.  He'll fall asleep while nursing around 8 or 9.  I pump and then get him up for a bottle before I got to bed at 11 or 12.  He usually wakes up once after I go to bed, maybe at 3 or so and then he's good again until 6 or 7.  He's started to be able to entertain himself in the crib, vs just cry the second he wakes up, so I can listen to him coo and go back to sleep until he gets annoyed and starts to cry.  Good for you for nursing, but I think you have several more months of getting out of bed ahead of you.  :)|`|pj5bUjbQaa	my daughter is breast fed and is almost 3 months.  she sleeps about a 6 hour stretch at night...      my son slept through the night at like 2 weeks!!    your turn for good sleep is coming!!!!!|`|5EiShLZZaa	15 months, although stopped breastfeeding at 10 1/2...but, my pediatrician says sleeping through the night isn't sleeping 8 hours straight during the night, it is sleeping any longer than 4 hours in a row, whether day or night!!!  Good luck!|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	5 hours straight is considered sleeping through the night- my son did that at 3 months old and when i woke up before him i almost had a heart attack. 7 weeks is a little early to be asking of this lol. my son is 21 months and still wakes up once on occasion|`|c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	Lilah was 3 months old.  She just decided one night to go to sleep at 8pm and wake up around 7am and has been doing it ever since - give or take an hour or so here and there.  She sleeps 12-13 hours a night.  She is 6 months old. =)|`|LQqAzHbVaa	My daughter is 4 now and she still does not sleep through the night  and I am sooooooo tired.....  so....good luck with that
TjLrQemeaa	I love the name Matilda! Very elegant and classy!|`|VHHis05Naa	I absolutely adore Matilda!  I'd choose it for a child of my own if my husband didn't dislike it.

Those are just my 5 girls names :)|`|419b54befe425a1ea6fbb7f00aaf095aaa	No I don't like the name Matilda, it is kind of old fashioned. I like Miranda,or Marisa, even Mellisa. But not Matilda.

I don't want to be borrowing anybody else's name but I love Matilda Rose.  Isn't that beautiful!    Gongrats on your new daughter!
kc2Sa7ibaa	Exactly! I don't think it is fair to judge people by looks although we as a society always do. Beauty is so debatable. What is attractive to one person isn't to another.|`|d5K8wORqaa	yupp  i used to be ajudgemental bit*h  i met these twins n they weere ugly and weird   that was 2 years ago  i recently got to know them and they are soo cool and funny  theres this girl i always saw on the bus she was quiet n not that pretty and i was scared of her i thought she was a serial killer  i got to know her and shes one of the nicest people i no|`|kRaVa0Wraa	i dont know if its so much about the  personality...  for example:    i am friends with a girl who is gorgeous. like, drop dead gorgeous. blonde hair, blue eyes, tall, skinny, perfect teeth. but as ive spent more and more time with her she doesnt seem as pretty to me because ive just seen her so much. shes a very very nice girl.    another one of my friends i thought was just average, but i actually think she's gorgeous now that ive gotten to know her, and i like her less than i like the girl i mentioned above.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	ya iv also notice that girls seem prettier when you think they are crushing on you     there are all kinds of things that make someone more beautiful|`|D8gFfDwuaa	Oh yeah! I like so agree. and the world is sadly a judgmental place. Judging people isn't nice but it happens. I actually have all stunningly beautiful friends, mostly personality wise. I also have a few who strike me as ugly people. It had nothing to do with their looks though.    It's weird.|`|3Yfp3QUfaa	Ya, When I was young I knew this girl and I thought she was like really pretty and when I got to know her she seemed really ugly!!!!!! She was spoiled and full of herself and was all like blondes are prettier and have more fun! Im brunette! GOD!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Its exactly why I strongly believe in the saying, "Beauty is only skin deep" and "Its the inside that counts".  I know most people think that's cliche', but its honestly how I feel and how it always seems to go.|`|MBSrbJuAaa	Yeah. My friends may look average (or lower) to anyone else, but to me they are the prettiest girlies ever :)|`|Bzy8wSsdaa	yup iv noticed.|`|6lSbmXunaa	Exactly! Me too bacause you just ignore their flaws if they're nice but you start to notice that the mean people aren't all they're cracked up to be.|`|ebe7bb94d9e93512e6ba798faf11e91daa	A person's actions can change the way you look at them.  No matter how someones appearance is they could unattractive and have the best personally in the world compared to the most attractive that has the most awful attitude in the world. So no matter how they look it's their personality that makes you want to be around them more.
SaINc1Plaa	start dressing cuter and flirt more... you'll get a bf!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Wow, that took me back.  When I was your age I felt just like you and spent most of my time in high school desiring that very thing and by the end of it all I realized just how much I had missed out on due to my obsession with finding a guy.  My advise is to relax and just enjoy school.  Find a group of girls to hang out with if you don't already have a circle of friends and just enjoy the ride.  Guys can tell when a girl is desperate for a guy and they usually run from the girl (and the bad one's just get together with you to try to have sex).  Stop looking and being desperate and one will eventually come to you and if not, just have fun growing up.|`|2osuEr0naa	Ah honey, your so young. Trust me, there is going to be a guy out there that's going to like you even when you look your WORST. your young, now is the time to enjoy your life. And make-out buddy just leads to things that you shouldn't be doing. :/     What i try to do is when I was your age, and i wanted a boyfriend, when i least expect it, he showed up. :) Don't rush it.  And you are good enough, the right guy just hasnt noticed it yet. You're going to find someone. Good luck to you, and be safe!|`|UTlnR0Ugaa	here's my advice: get a life. you don't need to be in a relationship. you're fourteen years old. (or fifteen)|`|iTk7aaYdaa	ok it pissez me off wen ppl like u complain about ur love life like dat !    look at me, im 16 & ive NVR hada boyfriend b4 in ma life !!  i used to want one, but i got over it, cuz guyz at dat age r retarded dey only think about sex okay?    ur not gna find a guy out der who will like u for u in ur freshman yr of high skool, no matter wat, ur relationship will end in 2 months..8 months tops      u sound rly desperate & it prolly showz in ur personality which is a huge turn-off so jus chill, stop lookin for a boyfriend, & wait for him to find u|`|7OthMaLfaa	Ok listen, I'm a boy but i still think you will find my advice use full... Also of these ppl are right, and being desperate can show in your personality. But don't try going for the mellow personality (guys don't go for the quiet girls, unless they aren't any other girls to hit on). And I have many girls that like me, (it just that none of them are the girl i want) And i kinda just gave up on finding that "perfect girl" and yes im desperate i guess you could say... but i don't show it at all, even to my friends. So i plan on just waiting and hoping that she shows up one day... Try watching the movie "The Secret" try that for getting the perfect bf
CT3hTng7aa	You're just having a great day!!!  I know what you mean though.  I get worried when I'm not feeling like crap.  I'm 8 weeks so far.  As long as you don't have cramping or bleeding, you are fine.  You probably have your first doctor's appointment next week, so just mention it to your doctor.  Some women have no symptoms, can you believe it?!|`|4MjSgjAAaa	i don't want to scare you but this happened to me and i thought nothing of it i went for my 12 week scan on 13 nov and was told that my baby had stopped growing at 8 weeks and that there was no sign of a heart beat   you should go contact your early pregnancy unit and they can give you an early scan to see if thing s are ok  i am only telling you this to inform you on all the facts it is easy to say yeah you sound ok and you are one of the lucky ones and i really hope you are but i just wanted to let you know the other side to things hun it is called a missed miscarriage   i really hope this isn't the case for you and i am throwing loads of good luck your way but i would go see your gp or contact your epu just to be on the safe side|`|LKIhUMCgaa	the tenderness goes away. so yes it's normal. sometime in my first trimester they stopped hurting, so did my nipples, and they haven't ever since, my nipples only get a little bit irritated once in a while, but my breasts r fine, my b/f is so happy bout that bc now he can grab them lol|`|mPTBU0QDaa	I had those days too, when I felt much better than normal. I'd get scared that the baby had died, but it ended up being nothing. Don't worry about it. Some days are worse than others. Then, when the pain and sickness come back, it's like,"crap, I should have enjoyed it while it was gone!" But seriously, I am 13 weeks now and have had no problems.|`|o8xNTVWTaa	ur probly just having a good day enjoy it !|`|6L9jJnchaa	Lucky you, lol.

1MEnCmwoaa	well, i think you should just let it go for now. people will always buy clothes! they love picking out the little cute outfits.  plus, i found that most people don't go shopping until the week before or the week of, so depending on when your shower is don't worry yet!  If you really want to say something make it more like, oh i have so many baby clothes! i really hope i get this.....  then it will be more of an excitement thing on your part.  also, a lot of people include receipts so if they do for clothing you can always return it.   you don't want to step on any toes when it is a shower for you. my SIL did that (she was a big baby about the location) and i know my family who paid a lot of money for it were not happy.|`|59M4xUwXaa	hopefully they will give you gift reciepts. Alot of people shop the day of the shower. And alot of people don't update the registry with their purchases.|`|w2GG8Z99aa	If they do buy clothes, simply return them and/or exchange them for the items that you need/want that you didn't receive. BTW, I have no problem with tactfully telling (or being told!) that clothing is no longer needed, so to please purchase something else for the baby.|`|vGpawdUCaa	You will be surprised how many clothes a baby can through in a day,especially when they start to spit up. I think it would be okay to say something just in conversation, the worst thing about it is when people don't buy the right size for the right season. But you will be surprised by what friends get you :)|`|AA12204338	As my mom would say, "get what you get and don't pitch a fit."  If someone were to ask, then state oh, I really don't need any more clothes but I wouldn't go out of my way to tell people what to give me as a shower gift.  I don't know, that seems kind of tacky.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	You can drop hints around your friends "I spent ALL NIGHT washing and folding all the clothes my mom has given me for the baby" or "I don't know how this baby is ever going to wear all the clothes my mom has gotten him!"  If someone said that to me, I'd be sure not to buy clothes.  I know how you feel though- so I rarely buy clothes for baby showers.  I try to get practical stuff.
jiwTWNNtaa	I'm so sorry, but you're both stuck with it until she feels better. Coughing is very difficult to stop and cough medicines really don't have any measurable effect. I understand her misery and how terrible it is for you to have to hear. My kids get terrible coughs with colds and you'll learn over time the "sound" of each different kind.    1. Teach her to blow her nose well. In the meantime, use the booger-sucker (nasal aspirator) and get the snot out often.  2. Run a humidifier or vaporizer.  3. Use Vicks Vapor rub or Vicks Vapor plug in.  4. Give her a lollipop (under strict supervision)  5. Warm soup  6. In a coughing fit, try to clear her nose and take her in the steamy bathroom.  7. If the steamy bathroom doesn't work after 15-20 minutes, bundle her up and take her outside on the porch for a story in the cold air.  8. Put a couple of decks of cards or something of similar size under the feet of the head of her bed.  I hope she feels better soon, take naps while you can so you won't be too tired if she's up coughing or throws up from it later tonight.|`|j4rirb8laa	Give her plenty of water / juice,   also steam from a hot bath but be careful she not near the hot water.  Next go to you GP. Cold or not she is only 2yr|`|GhLcKwmYaa	i would use Tylenol, Loratadine, or Claratin.|`|eFxN59SXaa	i would suggest going to your doctor and asking for breathing treatments. they are awesome and clears the cough right up. we actually keep a breathing machine at our house for when my son gets a cold. he is 7 and have had it since he was a baby. it breaks the cough loose and within a day or two it clears it up :)|`|YmLcF2rSaa	You did what is right.Also be sure that you keep plenty fluids in her.Pedalyte or juicy juice,not gatorade unless it is watered a little.  Im sure you will but get her to a physican.|`|kpi69PHWaa	Unless it's croup not much can be done for a cough. Just a waiting game. A lot of over the counter cough medications are a huge waste of money and largely ineffective.     If it is croup (characterized by seal barking-like cough that is worse at night, almost totally gone during the day) cold air helps, a humidifyer helps. If (CROUP ONLY) is not helped by these methods, a doctor may give a single dose of a steriod that will help decrease the effects of croup.|`|0cuWRJp4aa	This is good for coughing for children or adults:    At bedtime rub the bottoms of the feet with Vicks Vapor Rub and put socks on it helps your coughing.|`|525065471178504d5bad6323445442f3aa	Honey will help suppress the cough. 2 years old is too young to be giving her Triaminic. The FDA is still doing research on the effectiveness of cough and cold products for children under the age of 6. As it stands now, cough and cold products are NOT recommended for children under 6. Call her Dr. You can try the Gentle Vapors plug in vaporizer. It works fairly well for my son.
w4zjmhxoaa	I turned to all finger foods at 10 months for my son.  He was the same way.    He would eat:  avocado cut into small pieces  peas  cooked carrots, cut into small pieces  sweet potatoes, cooked and cut into chunks  squash, prepared same as sweet potatoes  I would often buy a packet of mixed frozen veggies (carrots, peas and corn), thaw, cook and give them to him for a snack (or at meal time)  cauliflower and broccoli, cooked and cut into pieces    mangoes cut into pieces  pears  plums  blueberries -- he loved, and still loooves blueberries  bananas cut up  peaches  cooked apples cut up    macaroni noodles cut in half  bread torn into pieces    pieces of cheese (assuming he doesn't have any issues with dairy)    for breakfast, I could give him cheerios with cut up bananas and then give him milk to drink.  Or, at this point he would still let me feed him the yo baby yogurt that has the cereal added    Meats you can do if they're tender and cut into very small pieces     good luck to you!|`|t1fx6kXcaa	If you are wanting to give your son read meat, my suggestion would be cooking mince. Cook some mince in the frying pan with diced onion, carrot etc You can cook it on low heat in a tomato puree. And then give your son the spoon and let him try to us it along with his fingers. At least with mince, he will be able to pick up the pieces of mince and the pieces of vegetables to eat. Just be prepared for a big mess.   Some alternative to meat for iron and zinc are legumes, home-made nut butters (my son loved them at that age), soaked oats and grains such as quinoa and serve iron rich and zinc rich foods with vitamin c (broccoli, diluted orange juice etc). Iron is absorbed by the body when it is consumed with vitamin c.  Good luck.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	honey, most 2 year old aren't even great with a spoon. i don't know that much table food that NEEDS spoon except things like soup and mashed potatoes. teeth are not need for chewing. my son was 7 months old when he had his first meat and it was Thanksgiving turkey NOT purred- just turkey and he didn't get his first tooth until almost 2 months later. make sure it's pretty tender and small pieces or you can give his a hunk of it and let him gnaw off pieces- green bean chopped to size peas, asparagus, pretty much anything|`|h59Bc4wfaa	Run it through the blender and just give it to him like a finger food. It's going to be messy, but I'm sure you bathe him anyway, right? My little man eats EVERYTHING like a finger food, even soup. (we put the broth in his cup) He has his spoon, just to hold and get the feel of it.     When you put it in the blender, make sure not to make it too soupy, leave some small chunks so he has something to grab on to.    Good luck~|`|nZpSM7ngaa	if he wants to learn,  let him learn on a seperate meal  thats  not as vital as breakfast lunch or dinner.  he should learn so that he would be able to feed himself.  make sure you still feed him,  just try to teach him while you are,  like switching spoons,  you feed him, he feeds himself?  im giving you ideas here.|`|68c6B8dRaa	You need to stop taking over with the spoon, period. I never spoon-fed my daughter at all and she was competent at using a spoon to feed herself around 9mo; he can do it, he just needs practice.    Use sticky stuff for practice -- oatmeal, refried beans, etc.    Re. beans: good for iron. Marinated black beans are a good finger food.    The teeth don't matter; babies can mash up loads of 'real' food with their gums.|`|74pfB2Bnaa	Try ground beef. When you fry it, it turns into little clumps baby can pick up with his hand and put in his mouth, but it does not need much chewing.  I also find it helpful to press an empty spoon into baby's hand, while I'm wielding the actual feeding spoon. Every few bites we change spoons. I sometimes found it helpful to have a third and fourth spoon at hand.|`|oO4TUkVkaa	if your running out of ideas for finger foods i would just let him try to feed himself if he gets frustrated enough he will let you feed him.  My daughter is also nine months old and going through the same stage.  She is getting better at the feeding herself part but does let me finish because she gets frustrated and tired.|`|iIBTB5jSaa	Just feed it to him yourself I know he wants to do it himself but obviously its not working. Hot-dog hamburger and tuna all have iron in them. Try that!|`|PW3hcVZiaa	At times I've resorted to giving my daughter mostly finger foods.  You can still give him beef- maybe some pieces of browned lean ground beef?  The gerber graduates meat sticks are good, too- I cut them into little pieces.  There's many other foods with iron, and breastmilk and formula have good amounts of it, too!|`|KNxs4PrZaa	Start giving him more finger foods cut into very small peices and well cooked so they are easy to mash with his gums.  They dont need teeth to chew finger foods, infact they mostly use their gums for chomping until their molars come in much later.  Anything can be a finger food as long as ints soft and cut small, avacado, pear, peas, meats, cheese, cheerios.  Also as long as he is still breastfed or getting formula dont panic, they dont really start to rely on getting all of their nutrition from table foods until closer to a year, at this point it is jsut supplemental and the breastmilk or formula is the main sourse of nutrition, so jsut keep offereing him different choices and getting what you can into him|`|6yCqTPSyaa	hey girl, scramble hamburger like you are gonna make beef taco's... let him try to spoon feed him sellf, they never want to at first, hun i got 4 lil girls ages 8, 7, 5, and 3, but its time, just keep lettin him try, give um carrots and other stuff with vitamins and iron such as hamburger
avx7bLnKaa	my son didn't get a first tooth until 11 months and even once the teeth start coming in the molars don't come til middle of the 1st year...they use their gums and strong jaws to mash the food in their mouths...  you don't have to keep mashing the foods.... as long as your son doesn't gag when swallowing small chunky stuff it is safe to introduce pieces of food....    yes it is safe to give diced foods...  my son ate tomatoes and black olives at this age, rice, beans, spagetti, ground beef, pieces of chicken, soft/softened fruits and veggies|`|B5AKcZ5Laa	you can pretty much feed a baby anything once they start to teeth and you can tell steamed carrots potatoes beans breads muffins you can also give him chicken but u dont have to but i always have when i babysat is sat there and gave them a tiny piece tht if we were to eat it you wouldnt be able to taste it but they would but yea just a small piece and layed it on the plate or tray for them to get and put in there mouth and once they had it gone tore off another tiny piece and did tht cheerios froot loops frosted flakes chips cheese puffs french fries macaroni and cheese (yes this ones a little messy but its so cute to watch them eat it and they tend to like this one) teddy grahams/graham crackers bananas  slice off a few slices of peach for him kiwis tater tots thts all i can think of off the top of my head but all in all pretty much anything soft you can give him at this stage just be sure to watch him try not to be too paranoid about this stuff relax and have fun watchin ur baby eat its always cute to do when i've babysat cause they look like they've got in a war with the food depending on the food you give them lol hope i helped and god bless|`|l4mMBe5Aaa	Yeah, he should be fine with soft cooked veggies and fruits (the fruits don't need to be cooked anymore, but if you're concerned that they might be too hard for him to chew, you could always steam apples and pears, etc).  If you've never been to this website before, I have found it to be pretty helpful: www.wholesomebabyfood.com  It will give you good ideas of foods for your little one!    Also, as a tip, I would show your son how to spit out food if he gets too much in his mouth (our daughter was notorious for shoving a whole handful of things in her mouth at once - all I had to do was put my cupped hand under her chin, and she would open up her mouth and spit some into my hand.  Kind of gross, but way better than choking on something!)  Also, maybe just put a few pieces of food in front of him at a time, so he's not tempted to grab a fistful and try to eat them all at once!|`|oaF2kaXAaa	He needs the practice, he'll get it if you show him how to chew... you can give him pretty much anything he's not allergic to now.. just be there when he has problems swallowing... it happens.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Think about how you chew food.  You bite it off with your front teeth, then move it to the back of your mouth and use your molars to chew it.  Babies chew the same way, only they use their gums.  The first teeth that they get are almost always the front four -- they are no use for chewing.    So I don't think it matters how many teeth they have, just if they are ready for finger food, interested in it, and can do the chewing thing when it's in their mouth.|`|ZTuBl0qLaa	I think that it is fine just as long as it is really soft. My daughter just turned 7 months and i just started giving her soft foods such as diced carrots bananas and that kind of thing. Also try the Gerber graduates puffs they come in many different flavors and my daughter absolutely loves them.|`|TVC3mAP7aa	Soft, diced foods are great at this age, teeth or no teeth.  Anything that he can mash with his gums will be great.  I'd also recommend pasta, bread, Gerber puffs (my son LOVES these!), bananas and beans.
74pfB2Bnaa	You could also grate the raw apple for baby. The main problem with raw apple is that  if you feed baby chunks of it, baby isn't able to chew it probably and might choke, or just spit it all out again. As long the apple is prechewed, grated or steamed to be soft enough for baby to gum, apple is fine. Either way it won't harm baby's stomach.|`|LhvKTYftaa	Give him slices a few milimeters thick (I take the peel off).  They can feed themselves, it is NOT slippery and it is thin enough that they can gum it up.    Bird feeding is kind of gross...he's old enough to do it himself...give it a try!!|`|cY8DgJv5aa	As long as he's not getting sick, super gassy and isn't having any bowel changes, then he's handling it just fine.  Remember to peel the apples too.  That's the part that will really choke him up.|`|174a0c67c52bf2d640d056db3d05e137aa	well maybe try to give him a thin slice of apple and yes they are soft enough for him to eat it. good luck|`|e871c3bc7828a54588e8b88635cfba63aa	Why not give him applesauce? Buy the kind with no sugar added or make it yourself.|`|AA11635143	YOU chewing the apples? YOU taking them out of your mouth, and then feeding them to a baby?!!  Are you kidding?  What's wrong with you cooking the apples until they are soft and blending or pureeing them with some banana and/or a small amount of formula.  If you make it the right consistency he can drink it from a sippy cup.  In another post you said he didn't have any teeth and refused to be spoon fed.  If you are feeding him solid foods like uncooked apples, he isn't chewing them he is gulping them.  Check his diaper and you will see that the food came out just like it went in. In whole pieces.|`|TVx4iWlGaa	why dont you put it in the blender or something? cooking it will soften it enough for him to be able to eat it. You can cook it in a skillet on the stove top or bake them in the oven. Chewing it first and then giving it to him is a little gross in my opinion.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	after about 8 months its ok to give raw fruit as long as it is soft enough for him not to choke on.  However i would suggest not constantly passing bacteria from your mouth to his by using the back side of a fork to smoosh the apple up a bit for him.|`|xMNpzFzGaa	No, never did. But you can, if you're worried about chunks he might choke on and pieces that are easier to digest. Started with applesauce then let my kids gnaw and scrape with their lower teeth when they were young (kept a close eye on them though).
cY8DgJv5aa	If you are closely supervising him, then slicing them, thin, should work.  You could also try cutting them only in half rather than quarters.  They are pretty mushy and he shouldn't have much trouble with them.  He should still be supervised of course though.|`|jsdDgIuRaa	I break them up with my hands into little chunks so they are easier to grasp.  He will also get better at picking up little pieces.    And someone said babies don't often let themselves choke, well my son did choke and couldn't breathe at all, I had to dislodge the food from his throat so yes, they can choke and it was a very scary experience and I hope that never happens to anyone else.  I thought it was okay to let him bite off chunks and he wouldn't bite too big of a chunk, well he did.  Since then I cut things up small (probably smaller than necessary but now I am paranoid).|`|LhvKTYftaa	My son is 10 mons in a couple days, but when he started with bananas we cut the banana in half, and then cust that half in quarters.  To reduce the 'slime factor' and make them easier to pick up, roll them in some crushed cheerios.  Works like a charm and they love it!|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	i will cut a piece with the skin on and scoop out the inside with a baby spoon and feed to my 11 month old--who does not yet have any teeth. easy and keeps her clean (ish).|`|Tm1HRIl2aa	I don't bother cutting up bananas for my son, never have. I used to... but then one day he stole my banana and ate it before i realised he even had it - had no teeth either! So I didn't bother after that!    Baby's don't often let themselves choke, if it's too much for him, he'll cough it out. Just watch over him, that's all!|`|TVC3mAP7aa	I usually break them with my hands as well.  It seems to make it a little easier to grasp the pieces as compared to when they're cut.|`|EyKJ737daa	Under close supervision I would do both and let bub select one although, I would possibly wait till the bananas are maybe a little more ripe and a bit squishier.  Having slimy bananas makes grabbing for food more fun for baby too.  Just giggle and laugh along and he'll catch on that it's fun not frustrating.  Otherwise give him half a "nana" as my 16 month old calls them and let him hold it and take bites out of it that way.  You could also try freezing some banana too and give it too him that way, helps with sore gums too.  This one wasn't a hit though with my youngest, too cold, yet she loves playing with other colder items, go figure! But experiment sweetie and see how he goes.  You are next to him so he shouldn't have too many problems.  Good luck and let the fun and mess begin!!    Edit: try mashing them too and giving him a spoon and show him how to scoop and put it in his mouth that way.  Starting that early will help him when he's older. I did this for my now 16 month old and she now feeds herself with a spoon and a folk.  I love watching her stab pieces of sausage and then she is mighty pleased with herself when she puts it in her mouth.  Just another suggestion especially if he loves banana, he wont care how he gets it as long as he gets some.
kc2Sa7ibaa	This is probably not much of a help but it is one of the following :    "Our Lips Are Sealed" - Hilary Duff and Haylie Duff   "Anywhere But Here" - Hilary Duff Taken from Hilary's album Metamorphosis   "The Best Day of My Life" - Jesse McCartney   "Girl Can Rock" - Hilary Duff Taken from Hilary's album Metamorphosis   "Now You Know" - Hilary Duff Originally sang in the movie by Kara DioGuardi   "One in This World" - Haylie Duff   "Crash World" - Hilary Duff   "To Make You Feel My Love" - Josh Kelley   "Sympathy" - Goo Goo Dolls   "Friend" - Kaitlyn   "Beautiful Soul" (Cinderella mix) - Jesse McCartney   "I'll Be" - Edwin McCain   "Fallen" - Mya   "First Day of the Rest of Our Lives" - MxPx   "Metamorphosis" (live) - Hilary Duff (Target bonus track)   "Hear You Me (May Angels Lead You In)" - Jimmy Eat World   "Fallen For You"-Busted     I don't remember the movie too well but if you type it in to youtube you might recognise it.

AA10719818	I'd wait.  If she starts throwing up again, take her.    Many things could cause her to get sick like that.  Maybe it was something she ate or just a sour stomach.  The docs won't do anything except what you are doing now, and that give her fluids.  Just keep trying to get some drinks in her, and let her watch some cartoons and get rest.  If it starts again, take her on to be checked. If not, she will probably be ok.    Good luck!|`|Om1yADWRaa	Make sure she has fluids and stays warm do not take her swimming or out in the cold too much try to give her a little toast just till fill her up a little, don't panic if she goes through the night with out being sick again just treat it like a cold and start on food again slowly as and when she wants, but any other bad change go to the doctor.|`|3oJL2Go3aa	If she is keeping things down. I would try to slowly give her fluids like water or pedilyte. Even if it is a little bit it will help keep her hydrated. She might have the flu or food poisoning. I know when I get the flu or food poisoning I dont run a fever. I would try and get a hold of her doctor first thing in the morning. He might want to see her. But I wouldnt take her to the doctor unless she starts throwing up again. Good Luck and hope she gets to feeling better.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	Just keep an eye on her and make sure she stays hydrated. But ALWAYS go with your motherly instinct about whether to take her to the ER or not. I would just make an appointment with the dr. as soon as you can. My kids will wake up sick in the middle of the night and be fine by morning. Kids are so resilient when it comes to illnesses. Just trust your instincts, mothers know best!|`|9ufltMBtaa	It might be food poising or appendicitis. You don't get a fever for either of these.

Too many scary things going on nowadays for your worries not to be justified. The parents of my 16yr old son's girlfriend (also 16) did not let her drive with him until they saw him drive, and then, at first, just to go back & forth to school, and they'd known him for two years! I totally resected their opinion, though, and so did my son, who really cares for the girl.

Tell her what times you want her to call. She is 16. If you taught her right, she should act right. Don't call every hour. That is insane. I would call every 3 hours minimum.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	its normal since this is her first boyfriend.    tell her if she wants to keep going out with her boyfriend and this driver, then they are required to come to your house a few times so you can meet them and know who they are.. if she isn't ok with that, then she isn't allowed to go out with these kids.    thats what my parents did to me. and it worked like a charm.    good luck|`|3kwMsbH9aa	your a grown women and you havent worked this out yet, shes going to this guys house and getting laid everytime right under you nose  how can u not notice the signs she wont stay at yours cos she cant get her leg over while you looking, she needs a serious talking 2 a womenly chat,|`|58eFDvwsaa	just tell her not to do anything she wont regret.     relax and trust her. other wise she will just end up hating you|`|gwUMipsUaa	See, I think teenagers shouldn't be dating.      He's sketchy, and you need to be the parent.  I would not let my daughter date someone I wasn't comfortable with.  Your daughter will come home pregnant, and don't expect him to chip in any.  He's only with her for the sex she gives him.    When she's 18, she can decide what she wants.  But for now, she's 16, and lives under your roof.  You get to decide what she does and doesn't do.|`|YNcsGi82aa	if i were you i would have "The talk" it would explain to her you want her to be safe and thumbs up on the freedom thing|`|QGkBZFqWaa	I think you are doing the right thing especially since you don't know the boys.
4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	First off, congratulations on taking a stand.  Not many people would do that.  At least, not enough.    Secondly, I don't know the exact details of how the interview would go.  I have had to report abuse and know an interview has taken place, but I don't know how it happened.  If you call the agency conducting the interview, I am willing to bet they would be more than happy to tell you the process.  It would probably be better if you were not there, either observing from a mirror or not there at all, so your daughter won't look at you for confirmation.  I know that's hard to hear, and I might be wrong, but it's my initial gut instinct.    I think you had every right to report this incident.  You saw an abusive behavior from your child.  That is an indication that abuse may have happened.  You need to report that so there can be an investigation.  That's your responsibility as a parent and you did the right thing.  Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.    I wish I had better answers to your specific questions.  I just wanted to write and give you some support.|`|tUzW2l1qaa	http://answeringonline.bajotto.com.br  A very informative website, you can also get much information in website|`|pnL5WTXMaa	perhaps you should have contacted the daycare director before call dss. it could have been something innocent - I mean, i'm sure you researched the center thoroughly before putting your child in their care.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Are you sure about this? Are there any other witnesses. Children have HUGE imaginations. You better make absolutely sure before you ruin somebody's career, reputation and life. Have you talked to other parents?
DP48dIxhaa	I don't like Archa. I do like Rose. What about Amber Rose? Or if your looking for an original first name, Arabesque Rose! Those r both cute.|`|Gdy6LSLeaa	name your baby what you want, its your baby. my son is teagen and no one liked it. oh well, they will get use to it.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	no, thank you but Abigail Rose works!|`|xqPRS6Buaa	I dont like it at all|`|CFU77qCbaa	Why Archa? Try a different one and keep Rose. Like Stephanie Rose or somethin.|`|jkDbDjcRaa	I think people will call her Archie...which is NOT cute.|`|eeKp9mStaa	nice, but you could think of a more creative middle name than rose...|`|KNxs4PrZaa	well Rose is nice, but there is nothing good i can say about Archa.  It sounds like a sneeze.|`|RJpekNPfaa	How do you prounce Archa?    Is it Archer?    I actually quite like it and it is growing on me every minute.    .|`|MDTgUDnUaa	I instantly think of teasing... "Aren't ya (fill in the blank)"|`|DptEIDiPaa	ummm not really. rose is a pretty middle name, but i dont like Archa that much.|`|iTk7aaYdaa	umm, no.    how bout Anya Rosalie  i think dat is very pretty(:    & it has da same initials as urz|`|zsnKf57Maa	Archa Rose is beautiful!!

Charla Rose, sounds nice, how will u pronounce Archa?
F6lZHRkVaa	I moved out at 17, but looking back (I'm almost 32 now) I wish I would have stayed. My mom and I fought constantly and I had to get away from her. But I was stubborn, I could have just dealt with her crap until I was really ready to leave home. I lost out on having my college expenses paid, and because I couldn't rent a place I was homeless for quite some time.     So it depends on the kid. If they're 18 and responsible, have a good job and credit and all that, go for it. If they want a college education and don't have the time to work enough hours to pay their own rent, then they should stay home for awhile.|`|6L9jJnchaa	I didn't even make it to 18.  I ditched them a week after my 17th birthday.  I could't take it anymore.|`|AA11537580	I moved out on my own at 17  best thing I ever did|`|zTal4HIGaa	I would leave when i'm 16 or 17|`|3fcf101a2615a631d556e32ec980eae0aa	I moved 500 miles across the state to attend a university as far away from my parents' home as possible...because I wanted to be independent.    Now that I look back I realized I could have saved myself a ton of money by just living at home and going to a college close by them.  Hindsight...
qRlPRJ1Jaa	There are alot of ignorant people out there who should never have children.  Only an ignorant, self oriented moron would treat a child like that. I do believe in the golden rule "do unto others what you would have them do unto you", so it will come back to her one day.|`|pnL5WTXMaa	it's not okay, but you obviously have a lot of unresolved anger. and could be helpful for you to get yourself into counseling. nevermind the loser down the street.|`|8Z5cqbrQaa	Well one thing we need to all realize is she is or was very Immature at the time. I think she is reflecting on how Irresponsible she used to be. I don't know the context of the statement but, what I can say I don't know enough about this person to make proper judgment. However; my sister had a daughter at a very young age. She was 16 and I was 18 I had just entered the service and went on deployment when she got pregnant. I returned home when my niece was about 1 year old. My sister said something and I could not stand by. She said to her daughter a 1 year old. " I wish I never had you" My action was swift I grabbed my sister brought her into the other room where my niece could not hear me yell. I stated that that little girl is innocent of the sins of the parents and deserves no blame for the mistakes her mother has made. Grow up and take care of the precious gift you have been given. I also said some things that I regret and where a little vulgar. However my sister has blossomed into a great mother. She looks after her daughter with great care now and is a very responsible person.     I am telling this story that if this girl still feels this way she may need you. Maybe not as a friend but as some one who will scrutinies and chastise her into thinking that her actions now have consequences to her very precious child. We all need to speak up sometimes....     Good luck and I hope this story helped...|`|BAjc1fZNaa	no  but i heard something familiar  this woman admitted on steve wilkos that she had 2 daughters to 2 guys  and she said she agreed to have her 1st daughter get raped by her 2 daughters biological father just to please him since he was rich and he gave jewelery and all that other crap and paid the bills...etc. soo she agreed also since she didn't consider her 1st daughter as her own but as a maid since her father went to jail  so the 2nd daughter was spoiled   the 1st daughter couldn't take it anymore after 8 years and ran away  {soory so long and i hope u didnt get confused but same idea}  =]|`|hGmq5IuZaa	wow ..just wow|`|AA10520442	While the statement is inexcusable the laughter was probably nerves.  She knew she sounded like a monster and you were thinking just that.  It made her uncomfortable so she laughed out of nervousness not because she was actually amused by her actions/decisions.    I feel sorry for her kids.  That's a horrible correlation to make: "I don't know the father so I don't like the kid."   It's not the child's fault that she doesn't know who she with up in the bed.  I'm hoping her kids will have a little better moral compass.|`|AA11540967	no|`|j9YiR51Xaa	My mother did one better. She hated my biological dad so much that after they got divorced she gave my oldest brother up for adoption and then kept my middle brother and then gave up custody of me. And I was 4. When I asked her why she gave me up she simply said, "Because I didn't want to take care of you." Through out my life shes done things like this. When I was raped she came into the hospital and was brushing my hair and said, "Now now baby quit crying. You know you wanted it, the best thing now is to forget it ever happened. You don't want to ruin those nice young men's lives."    Some people just shouldn't be parents.
xHmCqDQzaa	I like Rachel Elizabeth. It has a nice ring to it :)|`|44OH7Si6aa	I like Rachel Catherine|`|dPULl5hjaa	Rachel Elizabeth - perfect!|`|VR3soAktaa	i think the first one has a good ring to it.    i dont know but everyone seems to have the middle name elizabeth so if you want to folllow that trend, and it seems that if their middle name isnt elizabeth its marie. so i think the first one.    oooh the second ones good too :]    i deffinantly like the second one now|`|xLabGD6Maa	They're all great, but I  like Rachel Catherine the best.

a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I think there's a difference between unique and made-up. You can find a perfectly good name that is very underused but that people can spell, pronounce and not set back the child. I see nothing wrong with ethnic names either if that's your culture. However, when you're spelling things wrong, like spelling Caitlin as Kaytlynne, which I did see someone asking about, that's just ridiculous. That's not unique, it's a trainwreck.|`|9tMT4SQUaa	You make a good point, however, I have seen people spell a simple name as "Ashley" like so:    Aszchleigh    ...Is this for real?    It's just obnoxious.|`|xHy7ZjI8aa	i like Raylin. that's made up. :) i think that ridiculous made up names are annoying but cute ones are okay.|`|gxqawyxUaa	I don't like them. I'm more of a traditional namer.|`|SKJb6eLKaa	I like Aaralyn.. That's made up ;)|`|BxpGdVTOaa	I don't mind made up names. My mother has a made up name, and I think it is beautiful.   I just think it is annoying when someone takes a normal name and spells it weird. Like Kaelyegh (Friend of mines name). It doesn't make sense to complicate a name when you could spell it shorter and cuter and avoid all the confusion.|`|BorpWkDMaa	My name Zeby (ze-bee) was made up. I love my name, and with made up names come really good stories.    I am the second of twins. My parents had a name for my brother but not me. When the birth certificate came, my dad wrote his nickname eby and put a z in front of it to go with my brother's name Zach.|`|dWvBhfvWaa	i hate them unless they sound good and have a good story|`|8OoqHpbIaa	well said my point exactly!!    same goes for unique names at some point steve was unique|`|BAjc1fZNaa	i dont mind them it has a wierd twist well i dont mean wierd but a twist to it|`|iFDN69Woaa	It depends on the name. Some that are obnoxious like Miikahylah are just horrible. Others can be quite interesting and unique.|`|WfmHoFHbaa	some made up names are cute, others are just people adding extra vowels and letters like Aimee, Kaylee, Danni, etc. they're just stupid. people trying too hard to be different and yet all turing out the same.

Mine do is some respects too my son looks more like me and my daughter looks more like my hubby so they only have some things in common:)    This one is from mothers day last year:  http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o197/...    http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o197/...    http://i120.photobucket.com/albums/o197/...|`|AA10943329	for boy girl Fraternal twins mine look a lot alike.

All three share the same shape face.  I am the oldest of 5 kids and my brother that is 21 and i often get mistaken for eachother... he use to have long hair like mine too...lol|`|PDHCOrOSaa	Same noses definitely.  They do look a little different but they are still cute!|`|edoxElQfaa	my 7 year old twins look alike|`|c8TXAAj1aa	I dont have kids. Yours are adorable. They do look alike, they generally have the same facial features. I guess its a good blend of you and your husband :-). Be careful about putting your babies pics on the internet, there are lots of weirdos who are good with photoshop.|`|AA11029380	I don't think they do.  One is 6'3".  One 5'.|`|nfzQkvqraa	Your kids are so cute.  They do look very similar.  They have the same eyes and noses.  And the fact that they're making the same facial expression is priceless.  My children have similar features, but they don't look as much the same as your kids.  My son is and daughter weigh the same though, so the weight difference really makes their facial features look different.  (they are 3 and 7)|`|wacEc8riaa	your kids are ugly.|`|zXCFGPhOaa	Your kids are ADORABLE! They look alike in someways too!  Jack and Hannah look alike, Emma and Sarah look just like eachother (emma is 14, Sarah is 4, she is a spitting image her when Emma was 4)  and Ryan doesn't have a mix of me and my husband but looks like a spitting image of my husband while my eldest son is a mixture of me and my husband.|`|NI8D46J0aa	Cute picture.

I have 4 children (3 girls & 1 boy) and they all look alike, and they all look like me. My poor husband... you can't even tell he had anything to do with it. He gets that comment ALL the time.    Isn't it funny... I was one of 4 (I had three younger brothers) and none of us looked alike. My Mom was always jokingly told that we had 4 different fathers... one the milk man, one the UPS man, one the Mail Man and one maybe our Dad. She had a red head with freckles, a blondie, a brunette and a curly headed chestnut. Our facial features don't even resemble each other.
UDX7yqD2aa	I had contractions on and off for 2 weeks before going into labor with my second son. The good news is that once you do go into labor, things will more than likely move quickly.  The clear discharge could just be urine. This may sound gross, but you may try giving it a sniff. If it smells like ammonia, don't worry. I'm told amniotic fluid has a sweet smell to it.   The mucous plug usually has a "snotty" texture & is sometimes tinged with a bit of blood. Losing your plug can also last a while and isn't necessarily an indication that labor is imminent. I lost bits of my plug for about a week & 1/2.  But the day I went into labor I was losing more and more. Every time I went to the bathroom I would lose big chunks. Sorry, lol, gross word I know.|`|D0edZCPQaa	I am as far along as you are and ready to be finished with it as well. My due date is in 2 days. Hang in there.  I am also leaking the same thick clear stuff but my midwife told me that it is nothing to worry about right now. It is not your water leaking unless it is extremely thin. If you have bloody show on the other hand, then labor will not be far off at all.|`|xJW1RSaAaa	I would agree that you need to see a GP or doctor. The leaing fluuid suggests that your water might have brokwn and you need to go to hospital in that event, regardless of whether you are having contractions. I doubt either you or your baby are in immediate danger, but you do need to get medical attention.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i would call the doctor, usually your mucous plug is a short event, not three days,  you may need to be checked to make sure you are not leaking amniotic fluid which can be dangerous for the baby.
u9sGH0AXaa	I like diapers.com    If you put in the code bs5150 you can get 10 dollars off a $49 purchase, plus it's free shipping!    I just ordered a box of 252 pampers, and 2 boxes of sensitive wipes, a book, and 2 pacis all for 84 bucks!  It was such a great deal.|`|4qGap2Ypaa	i think buying them online would be ur best bet...also buying them at places like sams club which is bigger quantities..it will come out cheap...as well as at walmart|`|782343119cddb699707bd00049d73fe9aa	I buy diapers at Sam's Club. I get 274 or so for about $40. Thats for Huggies. They also have Pampers Swaddlers for just under $40 and you get over 200 diapers as well. The Sam's Club brand is even cheaper yet!|`|Fp15bb9uaa	go cloth! you can save 1500-2000 dollars per child, use them for your additional children, then sell them back on diaperswappers.com.    check out diaperpin.com under sales/announcements for great deals.     I've been cloth diapering my 9.5 month old since the first week he was born! all the money I saved on cloth diapering, I have put into loads of toys (used and new).|`|tQw6EDspaa	look for sales. I've found at superstore they had the largest size diapers pampers for 25.00 and I had a 3.00 off coupon. I got like 200 diapers for 25. Or kirkland signature biggest size at costco. I always look for sales, and then get a few boxes.  I don't trust parents choice anything so I wouldn't advise buying them.|`|mjz8JF9Gaa	target   or join bjs and get the coupons or 5 dollars off a box of 200 and get them for 25 bucks|`|J3rdyzNsaa	my daddy told me he used to buy my diaper off of ebay|`|oO4TUkVkaa	sams club or walmart is the cheapest at like twenty bucks for a case of one hundred and thirty diapers|`|rFtKFp03aa	diapers.com or kirkland brand - costco ...     after that.. walmart.. but I HATE their diapers..|`|ZTuBl0qLaa	If you have a Costco anywhere around you i would suggest them. I have used there store brand diapers and i think they work as good as huggies diapers. Just a few days ago i bought huggies diapers and wipes there got over 1000 wipes and 364 diapers for $45.00with a $15.00off coupon they have in there ad book. If you don't have a Costco anywhere near maybe a Sams club. I hear they are pretty good there to. Have you tried resale shops around you. I know around here you can find diapers there in a new pack for a lot less then in the store. Also try looking on eBay they have pretty good deals on there. Hope this helps. GOOD LUCK and CONGRATS on the babies!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	whole sale warehouses. like sam's club!|`|ddP3klT3aa	Not a matter of the place really..buy cheap diapers. Parent's choice or white cloud at wal mart. They work just as well as name brand. You can get 48 parent's choice diapers for 5 some thing.|`|cY8DgJv5aa	It depends what brand you like.  Personally, the cheapest diaper I've found that also does what its suppose to do is Parents Choice at Walmart.  Some people hate that brand, but for me, its worked wonders.  I've used them on all three kids.  You can buy a huge jumbo box for only $13.  I'm sure Sam's Club sales a bigger box.    If you really prefer a certain brand (like Huggies or whatever), the you can do several things.  First, call the company and tell them that you have twins and you really love their diapers, but could use a little help in the financial department.  lol  They'll often send out some special coupons simply to keep your business.  Then, sign up for all the coupon sites online.  You can get tons of coupons every day/week.  Then, take all those coupons to a bulk store (like Sam's Club) and see if you can use multiple coupons at once, or if they'll double them.|`|NAzAmFDnaa	I don't know what type of diapers you use, but I have found LUVS at Target or Meijer to be the best bargain.  Even with coupons, Pampers and Huggies cost more.  In my experience, all the major stores sell a small pack of name brand diapers for $10.24.  LUVS cost $11.50 a pack but have almost twice as many diapers in the package.  I've never tried store brand diapers, but Dollar General and Family Dollar have very low-price generic diapers.|`|Bw18seFqaa	the absolute cheapest you can get for diapers is to buy the cloth ones and wash them.    Otherwise, try a warehouse place like sam's club.|`|u94HOVz7aa	It depends on the brand you want to use.  If your kids can't use generic like mine (they break out in a rash everytime i use generic or pampers). Luvs are the best price at just about any store.  I order mine online at diapers.com i get a case for 35.99 and get free next day shipping on all orders over $49.  And i get almost twice the diapers you get in a case of huggies at costco for the same price.  My sister only buys huggies cause her kids are allergic to ALL other brands of diapers.  (i have seen the rashes they get from all other diaper brands and helped her find the one that didn't do it) and she buys hers at costco.  If either of us need just a small bag of diapers we have found target has the best price in town even cheaper than walmart.  If you can go generic then the walmart brands are the cheapest i believe.  But i have found that the luvs are only like a dollar more than the generics and work better, leak less and smell better.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I've never been to a Sams Club or Costco, but I would assume they have pretty good deals. Diapers.com usually has some good discounts if you buy a lot at once. Don't go to a drug store like Walgreens or CVS-They'll always cost more as those stores don't order the quantity of big box stores. And the Walgreens where I live doesn't even carry the brand of diapers we use in the small packages!
uKaj1kHfaa	Sad. Why not wait until you have an education, have done something with yourself, contributed to society, and have a STEADY INCOME. I'm sorry to come down on young parents, but many of them have no business reproducing.|`|AA11271437	Grandma was 15 yrs. old when she had her daugter so there's 15 yrs difference between mother & daughter. Waaaaaaaayyyy toooooooo young to be having babies.The daughter had her baby at 14yrs of age. When I've always heard of very young moms like this, I've always said, "babies having babies! Seems like no one wants to be a kid & enjoy childhood any more & is always in such a big hurry to grow up.|`|prqrQcd1aa	Honestly it sounds like a cycle that needs to be broken if you ask me!|`|qNf0A4V4aa	i bet they were fun dates.|`|BJERgbM5aa	She had a child when she was 15 year old.

They have a poor example to work from.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	I think that this a long line of women who think it's okay to start having sex as teens and should have had something better to do.  Unfortunately this website and this world is full of people who do the same thing all the time.  People are in desperate need of morals.|`|dPULl5hjaa	I'm trying to ignore it.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	They both started very young! She would have been 15 and her daughter 14. At least she gets to see her grandkids grow up I guess.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	That's crazy but it can happen. I was figuring out the math for all of it and she would have actually became a grandmother at the age of 28 or 29 (depending on the birthdays of course). Very young but as long as everyone is happy and healthy then that's what is important.|`|MzHwklzKaa	It's the wave of the future.    In 5 years, this will be the rule, NOT the exception.    What can you do about it?  There's nothing TO think, it's a done deal.|`|u5QS6bCLaa	In some cultures/societies it is very acceptable. It's not in my best interest to judge. Are they taking care of their kids and not mooching off the system? That's more important to me. I have seen irresponsible OLDER moms, too.
prqrQcd1aa	I hate to say this, and i hope that i'm wrong but the first thing that comes to mind when i hear this is sexual abuse. It happens more than you think it would happen, and most of the time they are too embarrassed by it to tell anyone, either that or they have repressed it. It may not even be something that you are aware of... here is a web site that has the signs... maybe think back and see if she ever did any of these things when she was younger and you explained them away as something else..http://www.protectkids.com/abuse/abusesi...    The most important thing to do here is get her an evaluation done with a mental health professional, to see what exactly is going on with her. It is not normal at her age to feel like this, yes it could have stemmed from the incident at preschool, but it is highly unlikely unless it was not dealt with properly by the preschool. After you've done this get her into some therapy.   I hope that you can get her to open up a little further about things and she can get the help she needs. Good luck. If you need to you may email me, i've dealt with several people (mostly friends) who were molested at an early age!|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	She needs a counselor or a therapist. She may not really know the reasons for this issue. She needs someone to ask the right questions.|`|UxG6CkU2aa	It does sound like this is stemming from something that had happened in childhood. Abuse was the first thing that came to mind when I began reading. But I hope I am wrong. It sounds like she may need to talk with someone about her fears. People can have irrational fears about anything, so this isn't unheard of. I would try to get her some counseling if she were willing to talk to someone, but I would not try to push it onto her.|`|Om1yADWRaa	It may be a good idea to ask if she remembers that incident but it may be good for her to go to out of school groups to try and make new Friends (boys) it would be a good idea to get this sorted as it may be very difficult when she decides on further eduction she'll be away from familiar Friends and have to make new ones. does she have any male family members she could talk to brothers cousins or her dad. it may sound strange but when she starts to see her friends having relationships she'll want to Venture but talking to a councilor at school is a very good idea but remember the talking cure isn't always for everyone. why not ask her if she wants to talk to someone confidential like online I too had a similar problem and found it hard to talk to people in person I was abused as a 7 year old by a family member that left me devastated and unable to have a sexual relationship with anyone but know i have expressed my feeling s and have a wonderful relationship and a beautiful son!    If you or your daughter would like to talk to me about any issues by all means just ask sometimes someone you don't know can be a lifeline. I am also 17.|`|C1DsQsWlaa	I mean, its normal to be "scared" of boys. Every girl at one point was scared of boys, but in this situation, I think its a little more serious. I think you should seek help for her immediately, before its too late. Do you think she was raped as a child and didn't tell you because she didn't know what was going on?I hope it didn't and I know its the worst thing for a parent to think, but it could have happened.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	There is something called 'Androphobia' which is 'the fear of men' and what you described sounds very much like it. The best thing would be for her to speak with a psychiatrist and maybe they can help her overcome her fear and find out why she is afraid (it could be something that happened and maybe she has blocked it out also). Here is the definition for androphobia:    Androphobia: An abnormal and persistent fear of men. Sufferers experience anxiety even though they may realize they face no real threat.      Terms pertinent to androphobia include gynephobia, an abnormal and persistent fear of women; and pedophobia, an abnormal and persistent fear of babies and children.|`|xr7VAS3baa	i would start to take her to see a therapist, though can stay with her, but speak to her firstly and try and ask her why she is scared, and that now she is is 17 explain to her that its best to see someone to try and overcome this as it wont be too long she will be leaving  school, and you dont want this to hold her back from doing things and going places with friends, especially if she would like to go to uni or travel later on, and she decides not and to stay around home because she is scared. i think self defence would be great aswell for her to learn because yeah you always get bad people not only guys looking to attack, but it will give her more confidence about being out on her own and knowing what to do and not to do in a situation that could happen.|`|tDoPAGUwaa	I think the possible cause could be the group of boys scaring her during her school years. These years are very important to a child's development... Or maybe there was some sexual abuse involved (and I strongly believe so). I think it is best if she goes to a psychologist or a counselor or someone who can help her mentally. Express her feelings would be a good way. Or tell her to list the (possible) causes of her irrational fear and ask her to see if she thinks they are rational and tell her, perhaps--not to generalize (that all men are bad).     I don't know if this is the possible cause but is it true that she doesn't have any brothers and/or her dad is not living with her? Lacking a male figure might not stem the issue but I think it might add to her fear of males.     Perhaps now, make her face the fears and watch TV normally. It might be normal to be shy around men at this age but I don't think it's normal to be scared of them. I think she might not be sure about about her identity and is very troubled about it so tell her to talk to her parents and/or family members if she is close to them. Or let her meet a therapist... Oh so I wonder if she can still read books or watch movies that involve male characters in them. Probably yes.     And does she talk to any boys at all? Or she talks to them but is just not friends of them?    And does she has eating disorders? Or any other phobias? Or depression? Or any (weird) habits (abnormal perhaps)?     I believe men are not that scary, of course some of them tend to be violent. But if all of them are violent then then the world would not be able to live to this day... ;) Besides, the males are the fathers, (however bad some of them may be). So tell her to express her feelings and causes by any means, best to talk them out to someone verbally.

q7mActnmaa	You don't know who the father is?  That is pathetic I hope your dad flips   when he sees the kid.|`|fMnzjULCaa	My friend's dad is racist, I mean this guy is a jerk. He basically disowned her when he found out she was dating a black kid but still acknowledged her sister. My friend really only ever dated black guys & ended up getting pregnant. Her dad was furious & wanted nothing to do w/ her or the baby. Now that the baby (who is 2 now) is here, grandpa adores him. Baby-sits all the time & spends a lot of time w/ him. Never in a million years did I see that coming. His relationship w/ my friend is still a little strained tho.   What I'm getting at is it's going to be tough at first, but once your dad meets his grandchild, I'm willing to bet that will change.  Also colored is an outdated word & a little racist, which obviously you are not. I would try to stop using it. Once your baby is here, you'll understand why.|`|XGHLrOklaa	What's a colored person?

DO NOT suprise them.  lol.|`|5fdgfNCRaa	When it comes to things like this, SURPRISES ARE BAD!!  Talk to your mom first without your dad there. Tell her you're pregnant and let the conversation go from there. Your dad needs to ge over his issue with "colored people." (I assume you're from the south?) We live in the 21st century and this is not a solely white country. He needs a reality check and I'm willing to bet this will be it.   Do NOT let him make you have an abortion. Don't let him get to you.   Talk to God about it and he'll help you.|`|nCjkx8qPaa	Honesty is the best policy, always!    Your parents are right, to a certain extent, to feel the way they do.  (without being prejudiced)    GOD made all of the races and saw that his creation was very good.  This should give you a clear Idea to the fact that GOD does not want us to mix races. If that is what He wanted, He would have made us all the same color.|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Well, you were mature enough to have unprotected sex at a young age and decide you were going to have a baby, so you should be mature enough to tell your parents your child is going to be mixed ahead of time. Dont wait til its already born and act suprised- thats just childish. Tell them now, so you can start looking for another place to live if they decide to throw you out. (Its much easier to find a place to crash on a friends couch if you dont have a baby with you).|`|IdwbQTIaaa	You need to be honest.  But remember it is your baby, not theirs.  I'm sure they will appreciate the honestly, and if they love you they will also love your baby.  It is their grandchild after all.|`|ZZM8S7yCaa	just be honest to your dad and mom  i know you're parents will be mad at you when they find out   but they'll be more mad if a coloured baby pops out|`|QUCIdBp5aa	How did you color your baby and what century are you lost in?     If your father doesn't mind a pregnant teen daughter, he should be okay with your baby, no matter what color he/she is.    You might want to tell him who the dad is, though.|`|i0CjdEkZaa	what's your number?|`|HCMrR1O9aa	wow, im sorry your stuck in such an uncomforatable position, if they already know that your pregnant, give them time to get used to the idea of having a grandchild, and let them like the idea of being grandperants then tell them, and if you dont think they will ever be comforatable being grand perants, tell them anyways, and tell them that it isnt the baby's fualt that he or she is mixed, its yours, and to love to baby no matter what, and if they still want to be angry, to be angry at you....(if you say it like that, eventually they will come around, your their little girl, i imagine they will forgive you soon) i hope i helped you some what hun...and good luck with the baby, dont ever let anyone tell you your baby is bad cause its mixed!!!! even your own perants ok? love that child like there is no tomorrow!!! i hope everything goes well!!!|`|1zdFrCftaa	tell them they will get over it in due time, if not then thats their problem that is ur baby!!
Ka52nbhNaa	I didn't get a refund but Babies R Us exchanged all of mine for the BPA free Avent bottles . . . they did NOT require receipt or box.  I just brought in my bottles and they replaced them with unopened BPA free Avent bottles in the same size and style.    Hope this helps!|`|ZTuBl0qLaa	Unfortunately i don't think they will. According to every store i have talked to it is not in there records that AVENT recalled any of there bottles. In fact in many stores i have gone into they are still selling the clear AVENT bottles. I cant figure it out!|`|GDobAMQ8aa	Your best bet would be to call the store you bought the bottles from and ask them.  Also, a store will be more likely to refund you if you have everything to return (all the little pieces and everything); so, make sure you have all of it.    And, as a side note, my 10.5 month old son has been drinking from Avent bottles since he was 6 weeks old and is perfectly healthy.  *shrug*|`|gJrHBtp1aa	they should still accept them. BPA is still bad for ya.|`|w7FSmSTnaa	toys r us or babys r us will take all your old bottles and give you credit towards new bpa free ones.

Lhn7D9L8aa	Don't listen to what other people have to say . If he or she is on the weird side and you like him or her then just listen to your own feelings about him or her. Be yourself.

I don't care what people think.  I may take their opinions into consideration though.  If someone is constantly telling me my boyfriend is "weird", then I'd ask them to elaborate.  "Why do you think they are weird?  In what way do they seem peculiar to you?  Why does their weirdness make you so uncomfortable?"  If they can't really offer a legit answer to those questions, then I just smile and go on living my life.|`|6lSbmXunaa	I do care what other people think about me, but not my friends or boyfriend.

tpY9nXbhaa	well go to a store are hospital to get a pregnancy test to see if you are pregnant or not but next and im not judge you it's just advice use a condom ok  or go to a clinic to get birth control ok so this won't happen again ok be careful ok please you are so young just be careful and use protection next time.|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Um duh get a test we cant tell you. obviously you could be.|`|6L9jJnchaa	Sex=pregnancy.  That's the way it's been for thousands of years.  I doubt you are immune.|`|hG8tLBSMaa	uh yes... and whyyy would you be having sex at 14... you are waaaayyyyy to young!|`|OuOOy8v3aa	Of course you can.  You had sex, which means you could be pregnant.    Just take a test, how are meant to know?|`|NVeGGcFyaa	Did u know that the reason 4 cervical cancer is because little girls have sex  before there cervix matures, they create damage to it and that's how u develop cervical cancer !!Did u know that once u get that u r gonna die there's no cure 4 that?its not only pregnancy u should worry about,im not trying to be mean but ur 2 little 4 that!|`|FnkeogO6aa	age has no effect on pregnancy, so it is certainly a possibility. If it was last month, has your cycle changed at all? You could try an OTC test if it's been 2 weeks since intercourse.
mPTBU0QDaa	PUMP! Breastmilk is SO SO good for your baby. It is a perfect match for his/her developing body. Yes, pump as much as you can, and freeze it. It keeps for up to 6 months in the freezer, so if you pumped enough, your child could have breastmilk for 6 whole months. That's awesome! The health benefits are unbelievable.|`|LKIhUMCgaa	if u can't breastfeed, u'll have to pump either way. it's necessary to get that milk out at some point, it can cause a lot of problems if u don't.|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	I would pump it is better for the baby to have breast milk, increases IQ and helps them build a stronger immune system, and helps protect them agenst allegies, ect....|`|OuOOy8v3aa	You might as well because breast milk is better than formula.
wZNWhjoAaa	well first you have to figure out how long your cycle is. by cycle i mean how long it is from the first day of your last period to the first day of your next period. you count the first day of your last period but not the first day of your next period. then you have to figure out when you ovulate. for example.. i have a 28 day cycle so im supposed to ovulate between days 10 and 19. this window is so large because you may ovulate early or late. so counting the first day of your last period count 10 days and thats the beginning of your fertile period. if you have a 28 day cycle then your ovulation day would usually be on day 14. if its 29 days then your ovulation day would be on day 15 and so on and so forth. my advice is to have sex either every other day or every 2 or 3 days from the time you get off your period until about a week before you period is supposed to start so that you will always have sperm in your body waiting for the egg. i know it sounds gross actually written but thats what really happens. also you can got to the store and get an ovulation predictor kit. there are usually seven sticks. those are usually pretty accurate. if your cycle is irregular you would have to average your cycle lengths and go from there.     hoped this helped. best wishes.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	Just because you aren't getting pregnant doesn't mean you aren't timing it right. Even with the best timing, your chances are still only around 25% at conceiving each month. Having sex 2-3 times a week means you will not have to worry about timing.     Good luck and baby dust!!!|`|caj2LAg7aa	Go to this web site it will help so much it help me out.  http://www.babycenter.com/ovulation-calc...|`|PrYY4xQUaa	The day before the day of and the day after your ovulation those are your most fertile days

Lots of baby dust to u|`|vdmAOQ3Paa	Never give in to wanting to end it and keep trying. If a doctor has said you shouldn't, that's one thing but you have to believe that what you want is the best and you will find something happy and good. I hope all goes well.|`|0M5XYROfaa	dont give up sweetie!!!!!!!      when its ment to happen it will  Good luck hun :)|`|e1c30509c868ec11e6a9ccb3145702efaa	Hi sweetie. If you had the tubal in august 2008 and the miscarriage in this month. It may have been too soon to try. I ama living proof a baby can happen for you depending on the damage the doctor say is involved. I have had two healthy children but before that I had 3 miscarriages and two tubal pregnancies. You can do it, it is just not time yet. I believe in God and I know that when it is time it will happen three fold. Work on you and being healthy and create the environment for a loving healthy realtionship with your child and it will happen. Trying too hard can put on pressure for you and your husband so just take it easy and enjoy each other an being alone. When the baby comes, being alone will change.|`|M6l6ncaKaa	I am sorry to hear that.   I know it is really hard to lose 2 pregnancies. I have almost the same story.   I will try to be short. Ok so, I had a miscarriage in august 2007 than an ectopic in December 2007. I didn't have a surgery.  I recovered physically very fast but not emotionally. The hardest part was that I wanted to make sure that I will not go through this again. So, I was referred to talk to specialist in infertility. I was hoping that he will help me make sure I will not have an ectopic again. He did a lot of tests for me and even one for my hubby. All hormones and other things were ok except that the tube in which the ectopic was, was narrowed or blocked the doctor couldn't tell exactly from the HSG hysterogram. I saw that the dye didn't go all the way to the ovary.  It is good to know that but there is nothing doctors can do to prevent another ectopic from happening.   So after 3 months of tests and ultrasounds I left the doctors office with 3 options:  1) To try natural as before  2) To use clomid (which I thought was not for me because I am ovulating and getting pregnant it is just not in the right place). About this I talked to my hubby brother who is a doctor and he said this may increase the chances of another ectopic as well.  3) IVF    With any of these options my chances of having another ectopic are 40%  So, we decided to stay with the natural way of TTC.   I tried to be as short as possible if you have any questions feel free to email me.   I wish you luck and never give up.|`|eemmWU0Haa	when I say I give up that's when I become pregnant so after this damn period is over Im giving up no more trying maybe this time it might work again but hope it sticks...I said I was giving up in September and got pregnant and it worked but I miscarried and in December as well but I miscarried that one too..sh!tty. so Im officially giving up!    Wish me like!|`|E8PiYH83aa	Dont give up hope :(  You may feel like it, but dont give up  why try in the first place if you feel how you are now?  keep trying! good luck|`|6yYeCVQFaa	You are in my thoughts sweetheart! I pray you guys get what you want. Don't give up!|`|jnW1hEWJaa	don't give up!!!  Besides the love and joy of nurturing a new life, it is your biological perrogative!!!!!  There are always a lot of alternatives.  I don't know your situation personally, but if you are determined to do this, don't let these bad experiences discourage.  They sure are ugly things to experience, but the end result far outweighs the risks.|`|BCGhOGQPaa	oh god girl yes   ive been ttc 4 five years and within that ive had a chemical pregnancy and a miscarriage   and i do feel like giving up have even said it to hubby a couple of times  but i said id give it one more go, im taken clomid and if it doesn't work within the 3 months well that me ill be giving up for good  but they say as soon as you do give up it happens|`|UGqOkYAraa	Yes but don't!  I was watching a health channel today about women who were having serious trouble trying to conceive. Or rather once they did conceive the pregnancy failed due to multiple miscarriages or ectopic pregnancies.   It rarely works on the first occasion but keep trying because it will eventually, although it is very costly.  Have you thought about the Fertility centre at Harley Street? They are one of the most successful for treating cases such as your own.    Good luck to you!|`|zif7kxswaa	thankfully, and ectopic and a miscarriage are two separate problems even though they have the same results. so your chances are still good of delivering a healthy baby vs. having consecutive ectopics or consecutive miscarriages.     but in the giving up department, i would say no. i have had 4 miscarriages, and i did feel like i didn't want to try anymore, but only for a very short time. i'm very sorry for your losses, just give yourself some time to heal. don't even think about trying again until you are sure you are ready. my thoughts are with you.|`|7iCPY50Vaa	I Know You May Feel Like Its Just Not Going To Happen But Dont Give Up No Matter What Like They Say The Best Thing In Life Take Time.  Good Luck! :)|`|XPSYZ3RAaa	Yes, but I haven't....    I have a daughter who is almost 4 and that pregnancy went off without a hitch. When she was about 2.5,  I had an ectopic pregnancy that was alive in my right tube at 7.5 weeks - had emergency surgery to remove that tube.   Since the ectopic, I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks this past August and am miscarrying now,  as I type, at 5 weeks.  Your question struck me because I am 36 years old, have never had an OB problem in my life and I am heartbroken from these losses I (and my husband) have had.....never did I think I'D be one of "those women".      I would tell you that "giving up" on creating or expanding upon your family is a deeply person thing.  I have a friend who is 43 and 20 weeks pregnant with her 11th pregnancy!  That will not be MY choice, but  you see what I'm saying....    The joy of parenthood cannot be compared to anything else in life.  You have to KNOW in you guts that a child is what you and your partner really want and just keep trying, praying (if that's your thing) and BELIEVING it will happen.      These 3 pregnancies have knocked the life out of me each time for a little while, but I've gotten up, brushed myself off and decided that I'm willing to take that risk again.      I know I'm going to have to check out a fertility specialist because I imagine that there must be something particular going on with my body.  We'll see how far we'll willing to take that....    Please keep believing and trying if you know it's what you truly want.  I'll be thinking of you (whoever you are : )

57838e5ad5a092a1d8a90da60915da82aa	Nurse, nurse, nurse!    Kellymom has some more good tips.  But more nursing is the best thing to start with.|`|oIFMohfUaa	OUCH...so sorry to hear that!  I've had them before. The very best thing you can do is nurse, nurse, NURSE!  I'm not sure how old your baby is.  In case you are new to this, the strongest sucking is between the baby's nose and chin.  So try to "aim" the nose to the mastitus/blocked milk duct.      You can also start on that side each time.  This ensures that your baby is sucking the strongest and making the most of your let-down.    This will NOT hurt your baby or make him/her sick.      Take hot showers or put hot packs on that spot...massage it while you nurse.      Take Tylenol for pain.  Call your doctor if you don't start feeling better.  You may have to resort to antibiotics...such as Erythromycin or Keflex...which is okay for baby.    Good luck...|`|ntdGOZqGaa	The other poster is correct, you need to just feed the baby as much as you can. Because if you dont it will get worse and they will have to put you in the hospital. Just feed the baby whenever and however much the baby wants, even if its like all day long. The more you feed the better you will feel and you wont feel engorged
DDYwnut6aa	Implantation typically occurs 5-10 days after fertilization, so it probably wasn't that.  Ovulation spotting can and does happen.  This would show as a small amount of blood in the cervical fluid, as you are describing.  I would say it's more likely ovulation spotting that you saw.      Here is an article that explains what it is:  http://www.justmommies.com/articles/ovul...    Good luck to you!|`|34jToOdXaa	Im sorry hunny... I dont think you are... Sorry ! Unless you didn't want to be then Congrats ! :)         Please rate this the best question... PLEASE... thanx !|`|6L9jJnchaa	Doesn't matter if he ejaculated or not, you can still get pregnant from it.  Implantation bleeding (which is really rare) usually happens about a week after sex, so that's probably not it.  You might have just been too rough.
WbJPQM1naa	Unlike the previous poster... yes.  Any parent, whether primary care giver or not, can take full physical custody of their children if they feel like it.  And if there is no LEGAL custody order in place for the entitlement of the children, the parents can travel where they want to with their children.  It is only after a parent has been to court and made petition to the court to make a legal decision as to who has full custody, or if custody is shared can there be any legal recourse for a parent who crosses state lines with children.      She might be leaving for many reasons:  better job opportunity, better housing.  Or she might be leaving because she is afraid for her safety and that of her children with the boyfriend.  You just never know, especially if she and her children are victims of domestic violence.  I would reserve judgments against the mother.  She might be doing what she thinks is best for herself and her children.    Now, if there IS LEGAL court ordered custody and visitation established, and the father is entitled to some type of visitation, then he may have recourse.  He would have to petition the court, where the order originated, to find her in contempt for taking the children or to have her answer to the court about how the visitation schedule will be fulfilled.  If she fails to appear to answer the charges, a warrent can be issued for her arrest.  Without ANY court filings, or written orders from the court, she or he can take the kids at any time and to anywhere.      It is sad that many parents who have children and are not married to the partners don't know this until they lose their kids.  I was single and had two children with a very abusive man.  He threatened to take our children many times and I thought that is was impossible for him to do so, since I had been their primary caregiver since their birth and he only became interested in them when he was required by court order to pay support.  But, I found out that if he wanted to, he could take them away from me anytime, since I didn't have a legal order stating that I had custody of them.      Here is a site where you can click on your state and read the laws for your civil courts.  Look up "children's code" or custody when you search.  It is always good to know the law.  If the mother is out of state, but he knows where, he can petition his local jurisdiction for custody of the kids, and she may have to return to the state to appear and allow that judge to determine legal custody of the kids.    Good luck with this and take good care.  R|`|01Mu3wUeaa	It really does depend on your circumstance and state.    In some ways, it would be considered "parental kidnapping", in others it wouldn't.|`|nPZi0wzYaa	Yes...but he can fight if his name is on the birth certificate|`|zif7kxswaa	no! she can't! not if the father of the children doesn't agree. please listen to me. if he wants to pursue it, it could turn into a felony charge! make sure you have his written permission before you take them anywhere out of state.
3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	Regretfully it is hard to tell. It could be that, but it could also be that you just had a weird muscle cramp.  Implantation does happen though approximately 5-10 days after ovulation so it is possible. I think it to easy though to get sucked into every little feeling we get when we are TTC.  So be careful not to stress yourself out worrying about every little feeing you get. I know it is hard to do, trust me we all understand.  Just do the best you can and test if you are late. If you get a negative and your period still doesn't come you can always take a blood test. Best of luck and lots and lots of baby dust.|`|lTkYWiy5aa	I think we are hyper-sensitive to everything going on in our bodies when we are TTC. For your sake though, I hope it was!    Good luck and baby dust!!!|`|34jToOdXaa	IDK see a doctor... Im sorry hunny feal better... :)       Pleae amke this the most valueable question..... thanx !
UUpsa35Daa	Some of the parents are just letting their kids do what makes them happy. Last time i checked...that's not a crime.    I know a family that has 2 of their daughters, a 6 and 7 year old in pageants. They could care less about winning or doing the pageants at all, they just devote time and money to them because their daughters ask to do them and they make them happy. I think they're great parents for wanting to do that.    I do however think a little badly of the parents who force their children into pageants or ruin the fun of the pageants for them by working them to the bone and pressuring them to no end.|`|Jo2DfRzaaa	They have something to prove, i would guess.  Why else would someone do that to a child.  Really thats the parents doing not the child, in most cases.  I personally can't fathom a 6 year old girl saying please put 10lbs of make up on me, give me fake teeth, and spray paint my body tan.  Why would they even know about that stuff at their age?  Parents.....|`|rAkWoweOaa	They are living vicariously.|`|AA10943329	Because they are trying to live their life through their kids|`|iXvy2Or2aa	probably because the parents are insanely desperate|`|prqrQcd1aa	I'm guessing because they think that is it "cute", maybe they are not thinking that they are making their daughter's out to be objects, maybe they think they are giving their kids a self esteem, maybe they don't' think that it will affect the children later on in life in a negative way... i don't honestly know.    I personally do not find it cute at all. I find it repulsive that mother would go to such lengths to make their kids "objects" rather than just kids.|`|bImlg171aa	I KNOW! Children are so beautiful...and then all these "beauty" pageants turn the kids into freaky looking dolls! I mean...it's almost as bad as chucky! I don't mind pageants when kids are natural. I'm talking MINIMAL makeup (if any).|`|0ZxYrtv0aa	Because every parent who puts their child through that has to know that their 'little darling' is the cutest.    It sucks. I feel sorry for the kids.|`|ob7jTC5Caa	I was wondering the same thing when I was watching a certain show about it.  Although some of the girls really want to do it and I think it can be a self esteem and confidence boost for them. Plus the money and scholarships involved are good.  I've noticed that some of the pageants are against the heavy make up and spray tans. In fact one that I was watching was appalled that one of the girls had a fake tan.  I think if the child wants to do it then they should be allowed to participate in it as long as it doesn't take over their life or hold them back from being their age and doing "kid" things still.  I don't think I'll ever suggest this to my daughter, but to each their own!|`|b9FnIeLuaa	because often the kids WANT to do it...I know.... shocking...jk! but honestly when is it a crime for parents to help their children do what they want to do!     I did pageants from age 2-12 and loved every min of it, my siblings do them too and they adore it. My parents did it because we wanted to and to help give us confidence, and skills in public speaking. They devoted their time and a ton of money to help us do what we wanted!!! They were very supportive, of everything we did( I did gymnastics, beauty pageants, dance, and played soccer.) They also reminded us every pageant that we were doing this for fun and winning didn't matter, as long as we did our best they were proud of us! I know MANY pageants parents are the same way!
WqkFJ2Pgaa	Since you ask, it was my three-year-old coming in and asking, "Mommy, why are you naked in bed with daddy?"|`|tbZNMfAsaa	um... probably the wrong sextion (hehe)|`|ACA8i43Gaa	My fiance and I were going to college. He lived with five other guys, but at any given time there would be one or two random guys that would stay there for the week. In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...
hTieELhTaa	well see for you to get a job, a career you usually have to be of a cirtin age. Yes i guess at 14 you can work at the local Mcdonalds, but alot of places you have to be at least 16 to make any kind of decent money to support yourselves. Its my understanding that at 16 you dont have to get "kicked out" where i live 16 is a legal age to chose to move out on your own. So i suggest you either a: call your local police department and see if the laws are the same and if you can move out at 16, or just wait till your 18th b-day. And if your any younger then 16 your just gonna have to wait. If your parents are that strict I doubt they would kick you out they would just ground you! Or worse send you to a girls home or something so you could be supervised the whole time untill your 18.|`|gILygKvRaa	well, you could say, i'm moving out..|`|kc2Sa7ibaa	So.. Let me get this straight. You want to be kicked out of your house where you get fed, technology (obviously), clothed, a bed to sleep on and well you get the message.    Do you know how many people would WANT to live in a house and not on the street because that is exactly where you will end up. You obviously need to grow up a fair bit.|`|b6fIIIhZaa	obviously your under 18 how much younger than that are you? You should finish high school before anything then move in together if you want out so badly LEAVE|`|XoYMRvtDaa	idk, get a tat, and a ton of piercings, refuse to do anything around the house, be totally rude and mean, hint that youre doing drugs or something, total your mom's car, etc.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Why get kicked out? Why not just leave or run away? You say you have jobs, a place to stay, money...why do you need them to kick you out?|`|AA11348344	Just tell them that you don't want to live there any-more. And that you are running away to be a nun.
UWZSiqXWaa	"Say you're sixteen, fixing to turn seventeen. When you turn seventeen, you're really not fully seventeen - because a year hasn't gone by yet."    What???? I think this right here is the root of all your problems. A terribly horrible idea of how counting and time work.    When you turn seventeen, you are fully and utterly completely seventeen that very instant. Ya dig? It has been exactly seventeen year since you were born. Not sixteen, not a day below or a day above seventeen. Exactly seventeen. And this is why you are seventeen years old at your seventeenth brithday.    Every day you spend after that is over seventeen. So technicaly you are then seventeen and a day, a month, etc. old... most people just dont bother saying that.|`|aJLx0nhNaa	Because you are zero years old at birth.  After you have lived for one year, you are one year's old.    If I have no money in my pocket, I have zero dollars.  If I put a dollar in my pocket, I have one dollar.  To count any other way would be misleading.    Edited:  Okay I see your confusion.  When you turn 17, you have actually lived for 17 years.  Don't think of it as numbers, think of it as steps across the road.  As you complete each step, you count, right?  So you step, then count one step, step, then count two steps.  By the time you've counted you've already taken the step.  It's the same with birthdays.  By the time you have turned 17, you have already lived for 17 years, because your age changes after the year is over.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	umm no offense but is this serious- you're not one when you're ONE DAY OLD. that's like asking whyy don't you start off with decade- and BTW you go by month until they are two usually         my son was born april 9th 2007 he is one year and will be two years- he has lived almost 2 full years- you need a new teacher she sounds dumb   see if this makes sense- i have lived 21 full years ( i am 21) but i am IN my 22nd year and my 3rd decade|`|a1731418e68343f01ae82b7c12846cf2aa	Some cultures do.  I would have been happy to live in one of them pre age 21, but now I'm looking for ways to subtract, not add to my age.|`|rAkWoweOaa	Because there are 12 months in a year.|`|PW3hcVZiaa	because you have to LIVE for one year to BE one year old!  One year passes, then you are one.  You couldn't be alive for only 12 days and be considered a year- it has to be 365 days=1 year.|`|vpL67nETaa	Because one year old is one year from your "birthday"    We are celebrating the years since your "birthday." The day you are born.      You aren't a year old when you're born. You're 9 months and some change.  You can't pinpoint the day you were conceived, and some babies are preemies, or born late.    It's much more practical to count the way we due, years from your date of birth|`|cY8DgJv5aa	Because you can't be born one year old.  You said it yourself, "when a year has gone by, you're a year old."  EXACTLY!  1 full year must go by before you can be considered one year old.  When you start counting, you start at 0.  When you get married, you start at 0 and work your way up to 1 full year.  Its just the way things work.  When you start a sobriety course, you start at 0 and work your way up to a full year of sobriety.  Everything starts at 0 and works their way up from there.|`|4qGap2Ypaa	because alot of people dont believe that a fetus is a baby yet...since its heart doesnt start beating till i dont remember which month they dont consider it one...so ya i get wat ur saying..but just like some people feel bad aborting..its kinda the same concept..some thing its a living breathing thing..and some just think it sa fetus that isnt really liiving yet... so ya its just not an accepted way of counting...but i guess technically ur rite... at birth the baby could be 9 months old.. but eh nope..     also my roommate just made a good point... christians count the days b4 christ lived as b.c. and then a.d is like a different counting... so in a sense its the same thing...count b4 he was born and then after he was born..so i guess we do the same thing..count b4 the babys born and the years after its born.... good question.. i like it|`|zif7kxswaa	well, your right, that doesn't make sense. when you are born your age can only be counted in months, because you are only months old. it would be silly to tell someone that the baby you had three days ago was 1 yr and 3 days old! :)|`|7Ds5E0SXaa	O.k i always thought you don't turn 1 year old until your first year was because you don't start with 1 first. I thought of it like a number scale. you start with zero counting up.   0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Thats how I thought of it.|`|EgGrKWjxaa	I think it is because the baby isnt actually in the world experiancing new things?
RyEfiuOGaa	Its not such a big deal. My mother smoked while holding me, I'm FINE. Calm down and take their grand-baby to see them. Just tell them not to smoke around the baby.    And chances are your baby's gonna be in a lot of smokers homes. Friends from school, etc.|`|dPULl5hjaa	You're TOTALLY CORRECT!    Stand on your ground!|`|AA12204338	Let me guess, your first child huh?  Get over it!  It's their home and they aren't even smoking in their own house while you are there out of respect for the child, man that's the big one.  You cannot get cancer from cig toxins on furniture.  Seriously.  As long as they are not smoking around the kid you need to massively lighten up.  Sounds like there is more to it than just the smoking...do you get along w/ your in laws?  Don't take it out on your kid.  And yes, I think you are being extremely ridiculous.  extremely|`|qN5iVvAFaa	Its up to you, you are the mother, but i would tell them how you feel, let them know why you don't want to bring the baby around... but me personally i do smoke, so it wouldn't be that big of a deal to me....|`|prqrQcd1aa	As a smoker with 3 kids and a mother, brother and a mom's boyfriend that all smoke, i'd say you aren't being crazy about it!  This is what i did. My mom finally agreed to smoke only in her bedroom while i am there with my children, we have kind of designated it as the "smoking room" it's way in the back of the house and there is a screen door that you can open to let the smoke out...    As for toxins on carpets and so forth, well, there are is always going to be something on the carpet, if happens to be toxins, cat hair, dog hair, some small object that only the child can see... you will see where i'm going with this in a moment.    Take a blanket and put the child on it on the floor while it is on the floor, or bring something for him to play in, like a pack n play or something like that.     As for the father in law, sounds like he is stubborn, maybe put some pure ex into his hands when he goes to grab the baby lol. Just kidding. Just ask him to wash his hands.|`|QQbbReRAaa	It's your child and you have the final say. If you feel that strongly about it they should respect your wishes. I smoke, and my Friend with the same aged baby girl asked me to wash my hands too once before I held her, which I thought was a bit overboard, but of course I respected her wishes, and if she asked me to do it again, or to do so on a regular basis, I would of course agree to it. Smokers obviously think it's not as dangerous as non-smokers, which I suppose is us fooling ourselves, but they should respect your opinions over their own in this case|`|AA12221392	I can understand that you  don't want them to smoke around your child and are trying to protect your child from the toxins as you called them.    Well does dad change his clothes as well every time he smokes, because the toxins are in his clothes, in his hair ect. Cig smoke is everywhere on a person, and just washing your hands isn't going to stop it. The minute your husband walks in your house from smoking outside he is still polluting the air with toxins.    So if grandparents are making a effort to not smoke around the child and they have air filters going and they are washing thier hands ect, your child will be okay.     Also if you become so extreme with toxins in general your child will not build up a immune system to help him fight off infections in his life.     You are right to not want these people to smoke with your child, but sweety I think you are just taking it too alittle bit of extreme.    Everywhere you go your child will face some kinda of toxins, rather airborne or by touch, this is just living...  So relax and really enjoy the baby and the love that a child could have from the grandparents|`|0Kw2yVp4aa	my parents smoke and i just get used to it and if it really pisses u off like me i cough on purpose and blow the smoke away and either they move or they stop smoking      sry...good luck|`|Om8Eab64aa	I think that you are doing the right thing and they should respect your wishes on the issue...second hand smoke is also harmful even if its in the air and not direct smoke...stand your ground!!|`|AjL9kZu2aa	I don't smoke, so I know how icky it is being a non smoker.  I do want to say stand you ground - but in the world we live in it is hard to protect your son in every aspect.  I respect that you are trying to keep him from the toxins, but maybe look at it from your inlaws point of view.  They don't smoke in the house, they have gotten an air filter, and they are probably thinking that "hey your hubby is a smoker, so he has toxins all over him."  I think that you might need to come to a common middle ground and try to see each others point of view.  I know it stinks, especially were both my inlaws are heavy smokers as well.  But I can tell you that your inlaws are doing a lot more to protect your son then they are with mine.|`|hTieELhTaa	did you hapen to read the article that was on here earlier today? it was about antibacterial soap and how being a germaphobe can actually be bad because you immune system never build up? Hold on let me see if I cant dig it up    not the one I read earlier but same concept    http://health.howstuffworks.com/antibact...      is it really that horrible for him to be there for a couple hours?|`|4692b6697395d1251f260c0920a151baaa	You are not being ridiculous at all! If we can't feel comfortable protecting our kids from the hazards of life we are doing them a disservice. Tell your in-laws that when you get home from visits you have noticed your little one coughing and smelling of smoke. Say that your pediatrician is recommending that you keep him out of environments that contain smoke as it may be something that will develop as he gets older ie. asthma etc. If they can't accept that their behavior could have a negative effect on their grandchild and comply with your request then they will just miss out on the joy of being grandparents!|`|5RoYyprkaa	My best friend is a new mom, and she smokes. In order to keep smoke away from the baby as best she can, she goes into the very back room and opens a window to smoke. You can't even tell she smokes in her house, and her baby's room is far away from the room that she smokes in. She keeps hand sanitizer everywhere and uses it before she picks up her baby.    You're not being ridiculous, it's your baby, and as a parent you want him to be safe. You can ask them to refrain from smoking inside while he's there, and you can ask your father in law to start washing his hands if he wants his grandson to come to his home.     You're not in the wrong, if they won't alter the way they live for a little while so they can see their grandson, then they don't want to see him very badly. They should respect you.|`|e7aeb2cff39c63298f29417537101f03aa	You cant keep him from smoke his whole life. There is millions of smokers in this world. I do think its unfair to keep your child from his grandparents. I am sure if he goes over they wont smoke around him. Idk i guess i see it different me an my sibs were raised in a smokers home an none of us have or had cancer or any other type of illness from "toxins"
PYySLOw6aa	when i was waiting to find out if i was pregnant I was sure my period was coming and I thought if I was pregnancy there was for sure something wrong... I took a test and I am now 38 weeks with a baby girl!!!|`|jsdDgIuRaa	If you have a line, even a faint one, it is positive.  And yes with my first pregnancy I had a lot of period like cramping, felt like my period was coming but never did.|`|zif7kxswaa	oh yes. i was sure i was going to start my period the last time i got pregnant. my temps had risen, the first hpt was negative, and i was having discharge and cramping, my bbs were sore and swollen, i thought for sure AF was on her way. but the next morning when my temps were still up i tested again, BFP! unfortunately this pregnancy ended in miscarriage two days ago, but that had nothing to do with the way that i felt when i got my BFP. good luck, and wishing you lots of sticky baby dust.
2I7mfeYOaa	The answer to your question depends on a lot of things- what were your cycles like before your first (ie: how long were they)?  Have your cycles returned to something similar?  Did you usually get symptoms when you were ovulating- like the symptoms you just mentioned?  (If not, you should probably see your doctor, as it could be something else- like an infection.)  You would stand a chance if you usually had shorter cycles and they've returned as they were.  However, as a warning, it sometimes takes a while for your cycles to return to normal after childbirth- especially if you were or are breastfeeding!  There are a lot of sources to help you if you are trying again- including www.fertilityfriend.com- they have some free charting so that you can see what your cycles look like!|`|mFZGIPcWaa	If you are still breastfeeding, you are more suspectable in getting pregnant faster while breastfeeding. And its better to space out the sex. Sperm count is higher if you have every other day or so.Good luck.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	25% chance per cycle.|`|UYJBPFj6aa	a 69% chance you are preggo..  CONGRATULATIONS!!    j/k   . we here at yahoo answers can not give you a for sure answer, but i sure hope you are...  i like to see people happy.  :)    really,  You have a 25 % chance of getting pregnant when you are ovulating  and most couples it takes 6 months to a year..  Well, unless you are 14 years old and come on here... or you do drugs.. it seems like they always gets pregnant, and the people that has a good job, money and a house can't..  when they are the ones "dying" for one..    It took me and my husband 13 months to get pregnant and we was doing it everyday for 7 months straight..    We always did it when i was ovulating also.  And we had a seven year old son from 8 years ago and i am 26 years old now...  We went to the doctor and they said nothing was wrong..  two weeks later, i was pregnant.    I think it would be cool to have kids close together.  Just buy one of those ovulating kits and it will tell you when you are.  :)  GOOD LUCK and lots of baby dust to ya..          ?^? ?(???)? ?^?      haha.. i love that little face.. sorry, just trying to make ya laugh, babe. :)|`|HThwnbVtaa	ok well the easiest way to find out when you are ovulating is do a google search for ovulation Calculator....best of luck

That's such a nice gesture!|`|XzV4bUeFaa	You could spell it Caireena or Kaireena.  But I still think most people will pronounce it Kuh rena.  I think it sounds nice though pronounced that way.|`|YMoBKBjtaa	Karina or Carina would be beautiful!!!!! I prefer it with a C, because I just think it's easier to look at and is just very sweet and soft. Carina is a beautiful, beautiful name!!!! Hope this helped and best wishes =)|`|VR3soAktaa	caryna|`|VGeekLNAaa	Kairena?|`|XHZtwfuIaa	by reading it as Karena i would pronounce it Kaa-ray-na, the beginning sound like when you say cat or catch|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i pronounced it ka-ree-na.. if she wants kar-ena then maybe spell it karrena.. two r's.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	Karena looks good to me.|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	Kar-rena sounds like "car"-rena but whatever way you pronounce it, they both sound very nice and I never heard of itbut I love the name...:o)|`|E8kzNG3iaa	I think Karena looks like "care-enna", at least, that was my first though. I also think it is the prettiest spelling :)|`|GZRHJBT7aa	People also might not know how to pronounce the rena part. Like with a long or short e. If you make two Ns they will know that it's a short e as in Karen.    I would say..  Kairenna. With the i before the r, it must be the Kare sound.|`|dZtToTIbaa	Kaireena?? Thats all i could come up with|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i dont think there is a perfect way to speel it that people will say it right every time but  I would just go with karena, i said it right when i saw it because it looks like karen with an a on the end and i think most people will do the same.|`|GMabcQXwaa	Karerena, why not just spell it like that.  Karena I would pronounce it as Kuh-rena.|`|QQlbvWj4aa	Karina is the first thing that comes to mind, but people are going to pronounce things wrong no matter how you spell it.    My cat's name is Kama (Kah-mah) and even her vet still pronounces it Comma or Cam-ma.    If you want a name slightly out of the ordinary, people are going to say/spell it wrong.  I consider my name fairly common, and even I get the occasional misspelling or mispronunciation.  (It's a very pretty name, by the way!)|`|NXPANe54aa	Kareina|`|6WMHv9fTaa	Kaireynah  :)|`|WVqoLROFaa	Kairreena  tdfl|`|w2GG8Z99aa	Karenna, Kairenna.|`|yXi3M5A3aa	How about Kairena.|`|GU3RauKOaa	Karena would probably be mispronounced a lot... What about Kairena? Or Kayrena? They would probably mostly be pronounced kare-rena like you want or kay-rena which is a closer mispronounciation than car or kuh.    Cute names, btw.
cY8DgJv5aa	Call them and ask.|`|Tfbbtxrjaa	I am an infant teacher at a Goddard School in Ohio. Ours is on the expensive end ($1350/month). However, I have heard that the average is $1000/month. It is expensive. But, at least the school I work at, the money is well worth it. We really love our babies and take great care of them! :)
c9f319ff78d1f6d6f6d248779b308999aa	I would assume it would be the same as it is for the slow-medium transition. when you notice that he doesn't get enough or seem to struggle when drinking, or if the nipple collapses, try the faster flow. i actually JUST switched my daughter to the medium flow and shes over 6months. i guess every baby is different when it comes to how they drink.|`|pXSKSS3daa	We used slow flow the entire time Noah was on bottles. We just switched to sippy cups this past week and he'll be 10 months old next week.    If your son is doing fine on the medium flow I wouldn't bother changing it. Like the saying goes..."If it ain't broke don't fix it."|`|RT3Og4Oiaa	I have tried sarah on a med. flow and fast flow, but she never liked them, so we stayed on Slow flow all the way up until now. If he is doing just fine on med. flow, I would just keep it at that.|`|DNygQdmVaa	I switched aroun 8 months.  If hes not ready then wait.|`|R2OMEjrhaa	my daughter started using fast slow at about 6-7 months. She was a fatty.  lol|`|5IlaGPxUaa	I switched Jordan to fast flow when he was about 5 months to the   6-18mth fast flow teats   Worked so much better he cant drink from slower ones he gives up and stops drinking...|`|50lIaC8zaa	I have only recently switched my DD to fast flow. (shes 8 months too). If hes happy with the medium flow then keep him on them, the only reason i changed was because we needed some new teats so i tried the next stage up.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	I still haven't, and my son is 7 1/2 months old!  He's still using the same nipples he did when he was first born.  I've tried level 2 nipples on him, and he drains the bottle in literally less than 5 minutes, and then screams his head off because he doesn't realize he drank the whole bottle.  Then usually pukes.  So...I've stuck with level 1.
reO9Dgmsaa	That is HORRIBLE!!!!!  :(  I cannot imagine how it would feel to have Sophie apart from me that long.  That mother was downright EVIL!  I am praying for Sean and his daddy, that they will be reunited soon!!!|`|Fx77zYhWaa	Yes, I saw this on Dateline last night.  I feel really bad for him and wish him the best.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I watched this story on tv last night. So sad :(|`|WxQFe0GYaa	This was just in our local paper last week (I'm in Jersey).  It's so sad and so scary that this poor man just can't get his child back.|`|iIJm5JToaa	Horrible, but it happens every day.  Sad to say, if he didn't have money, no one would know or care about it.  Normally, the US doens't help parents in this situation at all.  It's on the state department website, and hate to say it, but if you have a child with a foreign national, it's a risk you take.  That's why my baby doesn't have a passport, sounds cruel, but it's one of those things that you have to think about.  If my husband and I god forbid split up, he's not taking my child over any border.  I refuse to let him go visit without me also.  (Maybe I saw too many movies in the 80s when the big deal was parents kidnapping their kids to the middle east)|`|pzLDXL6gaa	Yes that's horrible, it's nasty when parents run away with kids overseas, it's one of the worst situations. What is sad about this story is that it's been so long (4-5 years isn't it?) that the kid is probably more settled in Brazil (school, friends, relatives etc.) and closer with his step-father than real father. So while moving him back is fair for his father, it might be unfair on him (and possibly the step father who might be a decent guy too). Keeping him would be unfair on his father. It's a lose-lose situation.    Harriet|`|IGwX328eaa	I agree with everyone it is horrible. my heart goes out to the father 4 years of trying to get his son back thats crazy im sure he's had many sleepless night. I really hope he gets his son back|`|DNygQdmVaa	Thats so sad. Idn what id do.|`|R2OMEjrhaa	That is awful, how could any loving mother do that to their child.|`|ev0SHwMyaa	yes i saw it last night on dateline as well. it broke my heart. i just can't understand why now that the mother is dead that the step father can still keep his son from him. it's such an awful thing. i'll bet now that dateline has covered it things are gonna change though. especially because the father of the step father was so worried about them disgracing his family name and now it's been disgraced all over american television, he'll probably make his son give the boy back to his real father. or at least i can hope anyway.
xVEqBjDVaa	awww!<br>  <br>  My 4 year old will go, "oh wook mom! " and ill look and ill say what? She will say, "GOTCHA! MADE YOU WOOKKK!!" Or she used to say kitchen, keeee-chun. Its cute :)|`|1VOsRV8Maa	My baby's not old enough to talk yet, but my 3 year old niece is NOT shy about what she believes. My sister had her in ballet classes and with the economy going under, she had to take her out for financial reasons. My niece went up to her one day and said, "mommy, God told me that ALL 3 year old little girls should be in ballet!" So cute! One time, when my other nephew was about 3, my sister was talking to him about God. (his little sister, Brooke, was almost 2 years old at the time) Brenden kept asking who made everything; the sky, the trees, the grass, etc. He said to my sister, "Mommy, who made the flowers?" She answered, "God did." He asked, "God AND Jesus?" My sister then said, "Well, yes, cause God and Jesus are one!" Brenden's eyes lit up and he exclaimed, "Yeah, and Brookie's almost TWO!" :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: Another friend of mine has a little girl who was about 3 when she followed me into the bathroom. I sat down to relieve myself, and she said, "Chan'ra (My name's Chandra), What you're doing, Chan'ra?" I said, "I'm going potty, Taylor." She said, "You're going potty all by yourself, Chan'ra?!"

6qjeneB7aa	Well, I'm 15. I live in SC. And just to answer a question you've asked me a few times about my crutches: I was born with Spina Bifida, and I used to wear leg braces, but I don't anymore. A few years ago I got crutches to keep my knees from turning in. They are called lofstrand crutches and my arm goes through a cuff at the top, and I hold onto handles. They look like this, only mine are black:    http://www.qualitymedicalinc.com/invacar...    Now, for this question. IF I have a career, I would love to be a special education preschool teacher. But even more than that I just want to get married and have children and stay at home. That's really my dream. I have no idea where or IF I'm going to college.     Actually, the only medical related field I'd probably ever consider would be pharmacy. I'm not good with blood, but I can do medicine. :D But that's just not something I've ever really wanted to do. And hey, if you have to go get more schooling, might as well do it in Hawaii! :D|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Sweet, we go to the pharmacy a lot, can't wait to see you there!

LZWZXPOeaa	Easy answer for any age.  Better time with date IF you like him or her.  Great time with friends.  Always.    What I'm saying is, don't go with a date just to have a date.    You're always going to have more fun around people that you care about.     tips: and trust me. Wear comfortable shoes.|`|RqJ4aDqmaa	This is up to you.

819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	There is no diffrence between a sonogram or an ultrasound its the same thing.|`|z7w6xyOKaa	I believe it's just two different words for the same thing... And for me my second visit was pretty uneventful. They left me waiting FOREVER. Then the doctor saw me for maybe 5 minutes. Asked me if I had any questions. Measured my belly? (I guess) And then I got to listen to my baby's heartbeat for the first time so that was pretty amazing.|`|WkaWSKNAaa	They are the same thing.  They are used interchangeably, but sonogram is technically more accurate.  As for your second OB visit, it depends how far you are at that time.|`|Xt1LxiWAaa	they are the same thing.    when you go to your 2nd visit, they will check for urine, blood usually, pap smear sometimes, ask questions...|`|K5TrkUhCaa	A sonogram is an ultrasound. They are one in the same.    Ultrasound: High-frequency sound waves. Ultrasound waves can be bounced off of tissues using special devices. The echoes are then converted into a picture called a sonogram. Ultrasound imaging, referred to as ultrasonography, allows physicians and patients to get an inside view of soft tissues and body cavities, without using invasive techniques. Ultrasound is often used to examine a fetus during pregnancy. There is no convincing evidence for any danger from ultrasound during pregnancy.

RoTLnFGZaa	okay. you're getting my girls perspective. :]    first of all- are you sure you're not interested in the three girls? get to know them, talk to them, and make sure you're not missing out on anything. if they are hanging around, they are obviously pretty into you. :].    secondly- how to get girls to talk to u- this is a tricky one. girls like it when guys initiate conversations, mainly cause their shy or insecure. so you can't really get a girl to just come talk to u. not the one you might be wanting to in particular, anyways. the only way i could figure u could do this is if you talk to the girl your into friends and get them to tell her that you're into her. that might help.    third- you're best chance with her is if you initiate the conversation. guys want a confident guy. so be brave & man up :]. {confident, not cocky. keep this in mind.}.  just find something that the girl is into and talk about it with her. go up to her and just start chatting about something random, like a class or teacher or something.    :] best of luck.   there's my chick intuition :]|`|laLW1Krwaa	in my school it works if u play with the girls in gum class or something like thAt|`|Aa7dLKntaa	Well to begin with just take it easy if you come a lil to strong they're just gunna think your weird. I sujects you get to know them by being yourself, sometimes the most immature people are the most fun to hang with. The key is to be yourself, then you attract the "right" girls being that they have a similar personality as you. I am a girl myself   but what i said is my opinion. I hope the best for you :]|`|HXlsQ2LZaa	we are like the exact same sorta.  im 15 and s'more  i have alot of guys i can hook up with but eww and several have liked me but i didnt like them.  and never dated...  anyway just get to know a girl.  talk to her be nice and act like she was just your best friend. then just ask her out.  it has to be a few weeks, i would say, or it just seems awkward.  some girls like guys who are immature but not too immature.  the girls who would be good wont care if you are terrible at convosations.  i hope i didnt confuse you. i confused myself..    good luck   :D|`|PGZGDmCyaa	go up to them say hey I'm _____.    what do you you like to or hey we should go cruise sometime.     you have to be a friend before you can be a boyfriend|`|pk8Oemycaa	How about a simple, "Hey, what's your name?" "That's a really pretty name, I'm ....., It's nice to meet you."|`|MA3KcLUJaa	Just be funny.  Girls love it when guys are interesting, and are funny and can keep them entertained.  but don't be TOO clingy, and attached to them because that would freak them out a little.|`|oeA5JgVCaa	aww u sound alot like my first boyfriend, tyler. maybe you could rap for some girls? haha idk..  rappers are hott|`|HFA05vDuaa	well ive never actually heard this used but you could say " Hey, can i have you're number cause i lost mine. . " yeah lame i know lol i was just giving you options. but anyways start out by simply saying hey whats up? by just having a basic conversation like that can be a beginning point.  now that you have something to build up on you will get closer and closer and eventually who knows you could start dating. but if later on you  find out she isn't interested don't stop talking to her. its nice to have just friends if things don't work out|`|3HWV0AkKaa	well...if i were you i would jus be myself. dont act like everyone else does. it makes you look stupid and childish. no girl likes that! oh and starting conversations is really easy if you jus calm down. dont get all nervous cuz its not like your already going out wit her. jus be like " hey hows it goin?" or " you look really nice today" i kno it sounds a bit cheesy but if a guy came to me and told me i looked pretty i would so fall for him even if he was ugly. so jus be yourself and good luck!!!!|`|G5lpSMS3aa	um well im a girl so just be urself cuz then like i like funny guys so be funny and not like creepy.just hang out like its your friend, i understand cuz im bad around boys!|`|sN0HURrvaa	if you want to start talking 2 girls then be kind of sweet and caring and casually ask them how they are doing, and ask if they would like to hang out sometime BUT try to get to know them first and don't try to be weird in any way or follow them around all the time. Also try to be outgoing.|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Be confident without being cocky. Even if U do not feel confident, just pretend. Be easy going but enjoy yourself. Talk about the things U like and are well versed in. Asking girls what they like and what they think is always a good opener. Talk about neutral subjects at first. Start with something as simple as the weather, but have something else up your sleeve too. Do U listen to the radio enough to know what hot political topics are in the news? If U ask a few things about the news, and they don't have a clue what U R talking about, U might want to find a smarter gal? U sound like an Intelligent person, so pick a girl who likes to read and cook. Don't let any girls put U down and worry U. Teenagers can be very cruel to each other at times. They can be kind too, so stick with decent friends. Too many people waste time on electronic games. They are consumers and not thinkers. Good luck.
lDuLyIbIaa	You can test as often as you want, but you won't necessarily get a reliable response for at least another week or two. The pregnancy test works by detecting the hCG hormone in your body, which is caused by growth of the placenta. This hCG hormone has to be at a certain amount for the test to detect it. The more expensive home kit can detect a lower level of hCG (i.e. detect it earlier), while the less expensive kit detects a higher level of hCG.    Good luck, I hope you get the answer you are looking for!|`|gRcVgmxVaa	You can begin testing as early as 8 or 9 days past ovulation depending on the sensitivity of the test. However, know that if you get a negative test result this does not mean you are not pregnant. The only way to know for sure is to get a quantitiative HCG blood test from a doctor's office.     First Response Early Response, Answer and Dollar Tree are some of the tests that detect a lower amount of hormone (early pregnancy tests)    I did not get a positive pregnancy test until 13 days post ovulation and I am currently 28 weeks pregnant with  4.|`|DgTZc7UQaa	test when you first get up the HCG levels will be at their highest|`|KozoNqpsaa	The only way to know for sure is by taking an hpt.

Your symptoms sound encouraging and if you are TTC, then I wish you the best!|`|8lchebCNaa	morning is acctually the best time to test! it shows all the hormones u would have frome being preggo.. when ever u do test now or later it should be in the mornig for better acuraccy|`|zDKcRdZVaa	Well it is time for your period to come so wait and see if that comes
zif7kxswaa	it sounds promising. i did not have implantation bleeding with any of my pregnancies, but my biggest early symptom was lots and lots of creamy CM. if in fact this was implantation you should be able to test in about 4 days. good luck, and lots of baby dust.|`|6766a597cb37bb1f650eea152025356daa	implantation bleeding = when an egg is fertilized and attaches itself to the uterus sometimes a woman will notice a small amount of blood like a period.    C.M = cervical mucus.= white discharge like fluid that can be shown on underwhere. when a women is fertile she has more than normal and sometimes in early pregnancy.      and yes it is normal if a woman is or is not pregnant. sometimes women have breakthrough bleeding or just rough sex or a pap test can cause it.
627pWyVkaa	Increase discharge for woman while pregnant is sign of pregnancy however It could be from anything. Better to test and wait until your period is due before you start analyzing everything that is happening.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	most women get more- it's called leukorrhea|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	I never had any extra discharge at the beginning but everyone is different I am sure. About a week before your period is usually when you do ovulate. 14 days after the first day of your period (or about a week after your period is over if you menstruate for 7-10 days) The only way to know for sure is to wait and see if you miss your period. Good Luck!|`|V9pZ0t8Saa	i had lots more discharge wwhen i was first pregnant|`|gRcVgmxVaa	It is possible for a woman to not ovulate exactly in the middle of their cycle. It's possible your body tried to ovulate and did not, and therefore it is trying to ovulate again. If you typically have regular cycles than it could be early pregnancy signs. If your cycles vary then it may be you are getting ready to ovulate.  Cervical mucous does change in early pregnancy, usually an increase.|`|8lchebCNaa	i would have to say more|`|mZoUXK9Saa	eventually you get more mucous, but not sure if it starts immediately or not. Go get a home test and see.  If you can, get a blood test, just ask  you dr. if he/she can get one ordered for you. Then, you will know!

S3vYMNzFaa	1. I definitely prefer Dominic.  I think it's much more authentic looking.  The 'k' detracts from the name by featuring a different name more prominently - Nick.      2.  I know Domenic is another variant, coming from Domenico, which is the Italian translation of Dominic.  But, I still prefer Dominic (all the Dominic's I've ever known have been Italian anyway!).    3. 9 I think it's great.  Manly, slightly exotic, with a wonderful meaning.    4. Dominic Anthony  Dominic Luca  Dominic Gabriel  Dominic Xavier  and Dominic Matthew    5. I've known 3 or 4 Dominic's in my lifetime.  I used to go to grade school with one.  All the Dominic's I have known are presently in their mid twenties or older.    6.  I did vote again - fyi!          ETA: I love Shelly Bean's list of names!

Probably 3/10, sorry but I really don't like this name... my mum's friend   is called Domenic and ever since I first heard his name I have really disliked it! Especially it's nickname, Dom. To be honest, I don't like any boys names starting with D.    4) Please suggest 5 middle names for Dominic(k).  Dominic James, Dominic Taylor, Dominic Michael, Dominic Shane, Dominic Ryan...

1VOsRV8Maa	First of all, for all you "know it alls" out there, I want to tell you that there is a HUGE difference between being submissive and being a doormat. A submissive wife is a GOOD thing. A non submissive wife will bring dishonor and grief upon her husband! Read the Bible every once in a while. It does not say "Wives, let your husbands trample all over you and tell you what to do..." But, it does say, "Wives respect your husbands! Husbands, love your wives!" There are two really great books to read. One is called "Love and Respect" the other is called, "Created To Be His Help meet." Read them... You will learn how to be a good woman. Any man who has a woman who will state, "I'll be damned if my husband tells me what to do..." Your POOR husband! He deserves more respect than that! You will eat away at his masculinity and he will feel like LESS of a man in your presence! In essence, you will drive him away with your disrespect! Someday, he'll just pack up and leave and you'll have NO idea why! Shame on you! Without your respect, he will not treat you with the love you deserve! And vice versa! For the asker of this question, I don't think the rest of the question has any validity or relevance to this subject. But my answer is my honest belief!|`|jG8b3Mz0aa	Okay PiercedEars what is your motive with all these questions regarding submissive housewives? Are you one?|`|M2yERqNSaa	youre stupid and lame , even though my question will get deleted, your idiotic *** will still be here tonight posting the same crap|`|FvYqKZSMaa	I agree with house mom that is to funny charli.|`|WNn8WDPHaa	ok..submissive,,wtf? and even housewives are aren't submissivs. I ama housewife..and iwill be damned if my husband tel sme what to do... and no...a housewife wills till take your sorry butt to court an dtak eteh money she deserves... submissive..my goodness..wtf?!|`|QM6wiVtVaa	No, because if someone is a "Career Woman" she isn't a housewife.|`|VwMkiLFPaa	I’m the one bringing home the bacon. So the answer to that is a big fat NO. I’m far from submissive.<br>  <br>  And regardless of my work status or how much bacon I bring home, I'd never stop my son from knowing his father. Except I'm lucky that I'm married to his father. Therefore we don't deal with all that child support and such.|`|b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	Think about what you posted for a moment. How can a career woman be a housewife, much less a submissive one? Most career women I know are working outside the home, which means they can't be considered a housewife, too. <br>  <br>  The rest of the question, well, that doesn't really have anything to do with it.
d4ac61414fc4c240b01f3cc34a7003c9aa	Try Aquaphor, it's greasy like Vaseline but REALLY WORKS.|`|AA10255759	It is the best if you discuss this with her doctor, and if he/she decides it's better to see a child dermatologist, they will refer you to one.<br>  <br>  Mean while, stop bathing her everyday, you can just clean her with warm water, just water, if you think it is necessary.<br>  <br>  I was directed by my son's doctor to use "Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser" it was so good that now all of us use either that or Cetaphil soaps. It is so mild, like a watery cream.<br>  <br>  Try that, and use Cetaphil lotion on a daily basis.<br>  <br>  I hope it helps, I know how worried you are. My son had small dry patches all over his body, like eczema, but they are all gone.<br>  <br>  Good luck...|`|BypjotRpaa	TAKE HER TO THE DOCTOR TO BE SURE... but most likely super dry skin.. the aveeno baby wash your using is great stuff, but the doctor will probably recommend  using cetaphil or aquafor lotion twice a day until the dryness is under control and then once a day..<br>  my son had the same thing at 3 months old..i still bathe him everyday and lotion him after bath..he is sooooo soft!<br>  i prefer the cetaphil over the aquafor/eucerin ..although it is expensive but it is not greasy at all and very easy to rub in ..<br>  <br>  edit...johnson baby lotion is the worst for babies skin..it has alcohol in it and dries their skin out... it only smells good so parents will use  it..|`|8WRnqs08aa	Take her to see a dermatologist. They can prescribe something for her!<br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  <br>  Mother to 4 beautiful children with Twins due Sept. 2009 (Babies # 5 & 6)|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	we use this aveeno oatmeal bath stuff, it comes in like a packet and looks like oatmeal. You put in in the bath and it helps alot. It does make a mess though so be careful!!|`|oX63syybaa	It could be eczema, or it could be another form of dermatitis from an allergy, among other things.  My daughter was misdiagnosed with eczema for several years and took medications that she did not need because of it.  Although it is common for babies and young toddlers to have dry skin, you should probably check with your pediatrician for an exact diagnosis.  If you still have doubts, take her to a dermatologist.   <br>  <br>  In regard to lotion, have you tried Aquaphor?   Granted, it can be a bit messy, but it does seem to provide a better barrier and hydrate the skin more than the Aveeno, IMO.   Good luck to you and your little girl!|`|Xc02z608aa	Use Johnson's baby lotion, the kind in the pink bottle.  It's recommended by hospitals everywhere.  If it persists, just take your wee one to her doctor, he'll know if it is eczema.<br>  My son had eczema and was prescribed a very low dose hydrocortizone cream.|`|OjHFN4imaa	If you are breastfeeding, put some breast milk on it. It works wonders! I know lots of people think it's gross but it's a natural substance that is chemical free.

Just don't eat the baby..LOL|`|a41163f923db4d89fc14dd1b1d973de3aa	My son has akways had dry skin which developed into eczema.

Makes their skin soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo Soft!|`|AA11736481	Use olive oil|`|dXVA1wHDaa	My brother had infant eczema and the first thing the doctor suggested was E45 cream.  You can also buy E45 bath emollients.<br>  <br>  My son had a touch of dry skin (possibly eczema starting, it was on his knees and elbows) and I stopped using ANY bath products and used E45 cream on his dry bits.  It's all cleared up now, and I still just use plain bath water.<br>  <br>  I'll second the oatmeal in the bath water too, it's apparently very good for dry skin!

I like it.|`|TYl7kmPeaa	i like long names so i am fine with the length and its not like you are gonna be saying her middle name all the time so i think it doesnt matter.. all that matters is that it sounds good    i like your choices though :)|`|EFzXvfbQaa	not to long..but depends on the last name..you dont want it to be 20 additional letters on..  but pretty in my opinion!|`|a5d3a73a2b18184ae9f44125b6ed78e0aa	I love Danielle, but not a huge fan of Savannah.

It's a bit long...but nobody says middle names anyway.

2TrHH0rkaa	I like:    Caroline Lily  Evelyn Rose  Juliet Catherine  Audrey Camille  Henry Dawson   Liam      I went to answer you other question but found that it already had a best answer. Here's what I had written:    I love the name Evelyn Rose, it is very traditional and extremely pretty. I am not so keen on Matthias Elliot.

Elliott is ok with Matthias but Matthias is a great strong name, I'm not so sure about the girl names- sound a little old fashion. Christopher Cameron, Christopher Michael, Christopher MAtthias, Avery Harper, Christopher Harper, Christopher Kyle Andrew.|`|M07pTI5Taa	love the name Annaliese and Camille but not as middle names, as first names (because i don't like audrey and mary claire and i love Harper Linden but it sounds more like i girls name in that order(a little to unisex... also because of the author Harper Lee) i'd like it as a boys name better if you changed the order to Linden Harper also i was thinking Annaliese Camille instead of one of them as a middle name or one as a first (which i suggested because i didn't like the first names matched up with them)    a few other names i would suggest is Alexandra and Jade, Leona and Sabrina... those four i like but i do love some parts of yours but non fully i either like the first name or the middle name rather then both together|`|brVj9ktDaa	i like camille for a girl  linden for a guy is good and avery too    for middle go with nicolle|`|yCYw735Aaa	I really like Audrey Camille and just plain Andrew or Linden|`|mPrUYEDiaa	how about for the boy you pick both. name him Elliot Christopher, or Christopher Elliot, although i think the previous sounds better.|`|lTOeMNnraa	There all nice names but to be honest i don't see why you don't just call them like a single name|`|79eBn6V8aa	hey...just my opinion, but i don't really like any of them...they all sound like old people names.|`|SBj7fhNvaa	Audrey ((Camille)) Jade, Nicholle, Leann  Theresa ((Isolde)) Nicholle, Briann, Reese  Nora ((Nicholle)) Grace, Faith  Helena ((Jane)) Jade, Briann, Reese    Andrew  Matthias ((Elliott) Gabriell, Brooks  Harper ((Linden)) Wade, levi  Avery ((Griffin)) garrett, Nathan  Have you ever thought of Elliot as a girls name?

7UIoQFKJaa	wow what a bad mother, seriously she should be ashamed of herself|`|J6vd8Gsbaa	OMG THAT IS AWFUL i would have said somthing but thats just me I think people like that make me sick and should be told about them selves|`|yIdwMPsoaa	i would talk to them. but not in the middle of the resto!. maybe at home!!      american eat too much anyways!|`|KbPrPuvhaa	hell no  thats a sick mom with issues.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	no. i mean, not like that. if she has a serious weight issue i might encourage her to eat healthier or work out or something.|`|a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	I would never call a growing child fat.  If she was overweight, I would buy healthier foods and I would take her to healthier places when dining out.  If my child were overweight, it would be more my fault than hers because I purchase the foods.  If she was eating too much while were out I would ask her to slow down and chew her food, but I would never call her fat and I certainly would not make a public scene out of the issue!|`|rAkWoweOaa	Never, that is terrible.|`|c7ae28466da4eed846a08b25d4de5f6daa	Sure, if I wanted my child to have low self confidence and base her self-worth on her appearance as opposed to things like personality or intelligence.|`|fH0cZIy1aa	My parents never said anything to me but i heard them whispering in the next room about me being too fat and ugly. I think i was around 14 at the time and weighted like 125 lbs. I'm 19 now and weigh 110. I want to loose more but my man won't let me. haha..|`|AmqQ9it5aa	No never. Parents aren't supposed to be critical about things like that. If a teens weight is really an issue a parent should get help from doctors and others healthy sources not call them names.    Society is already critical enough we don't need it from parents.|`|gILygKvRaa	okay take this from someone who expirienced this. I was overweight. and i wanted to lose wieght, so i told my mom. and she helped me it took 2 years to get motivated. the summer after 3rd 4th and 5th grade i wanted to but i got serious after 6th. and now i feel freaking awesome! i geuss what im trying to say is. i would encourage her to exercise more and buy healtheir food.|`|X1NVjZEKaa	awww omg! I think I would have gone over there and slapped the mom accross the face! The poor girl is probably going to end up anorexic now! That is so so sad!|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	A LOT of girls I know experience or have experienced this.... I was actually surprised by the reactions of the people who answered this question.  It's going to sound messed up, but this is normal for me.    I think parents take pride on their child's appearance, because after all, their child is them.  Children reflect their parents - how many times have you heard people blaming the parents if their kid's screwed up?    I wouldn't ever call my kid fat, if I ever have a kid.  It's a self-esteem killer.  I'd teach my child healthy eating habits and encourage exercise.|`|aOx2hovgaa	NO NEVER.|`|ZtuLKde8aa	Yes, I would, if she was. America's biggest problem is being overweight- it needs to be stopped.|`|sWQZbPy9aa	Wow that's horrible for a mother to say to their daughter. Would i call a teen fat to their face?No. I wouldn't try to think it either but I can occasionally.|`|HXZm0j2vaa	that's terrible! first of all you would think the last thing a mother would want was boys "looking" at her daughter! but no one should ever call a young girl fat! there is enough pressure to be thin coming from hollywood, the modeling industry, and the tabloids (look at what they are doing to jessica simpson!) the last place a girl would want to have to feel like she couldn't eat would be at home or around her mom.|`|ehEIpHgYaa	im actually pretty think size 2 or 3 but my mom tels me all the time i need  to start dieting blah blah blah even if ive only gaind like one pound or shell be like your starting to look chubby  hence i had bulimia all durin 8th grade  and another ed id developing now i think     so w my daughtner no unless her weight was a real issue|`|pk8Oemycaa	Being a teen, I would call a fellow aquaintance fat, but if it were my teen daughter, I would never call her fat. I would incurage her to loose weight, explain to her about the health risks of being overweight, get her a gym membership if she wanted one and buy healthy foods for my home. But I would never call her fat. That could completley ruin someones confidence, and crush their spirits. And It is un-called for a mother to call her own child fat.|`|3HWV0AkKaa	well f i was a mom i wouldnt be mean and call them a fat*ss or anything but if they were big and were overweight i would be like this is unhealthy and i would suggest you go on a diet or something cuz you are getting a little bit big!!
7at1Hyn8aa	Nobody can answer your question and give you a 100% guarantee.  After all it depends on your definition of comfortable.<br>  <br>  Would you like to have three cars, a big house, a motor boat and a couple of ATVs to go with that?  Would you like to have it all paid off rather quickly, or are you okay with paying the minimum on your credit cards?<br>  Those are all (and there are a lot more) questions that only you can answer.<br>  Over all $90,000 seems alright to me, as my husband, two teenagers,a dog and three cars are doing alright on about $50,000 a year. No great leaps, and no big vacations, but no major bills either. On the drawback, we also don't have any major savings,and the kids will have to find their own college funding.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|mldo1vxYaa	That seems a decent amount providing you live within your means and dont have a lot of debts, any debts you may have from college I would pay off as quick as you can once you are both working.It will give you a good start by getting a good credit rating.|`|57IDs4byaa	You'll be fine. You never think you have enough money. Just think a child will have just as much fun going to the park in a Ford Explorer as he will in a Range Rover. You are the one who deciedes if it is enough|`|T8ph72Czaa	It sounds like you have high expectations. There are people who live on minimum wage and can still make bill payments. 90,000 is in excess of what you will need to live comfortably... unless your name is Paris.|`|J1ZB3J0Paa	I must agree with JumpIn, as long as you people keep a balance in your expenses, it's enough to live a decent life without financial stress|`|wVELDOb1aa	Defiantly! That is a 4 bedroom house, 2 newer cars, and enough for the children.|`|5H8kjwHDaa	As long as you live within your means that is plenty.|`|cMsC5a14aa	Depends on how you manage your money,how big a house you buy,car you buy 90k it will be tight|`|NuvS5SMDaa	yes! plenty|`|60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	That's about what my husband and I currently make and we have 2 children and live comfortably.  <br>  <br>  However, I'm convinced that anyone can live off of any income if they budget well.|`|6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	Depends on where you live.     In North Jersey, NYC, Boston, LA, Chicago it will get you by if you live modestly.    In some areas of the country, you would be considered rich|`|g7uMKvEzaa	Alot depends on your cost of living where you live, what you do, where you spend your money. How well you invest it...Things change and so does your lifestyle. The secret is to be happy with the way you live and live within your means whatever they are. If you live in debt, it will take it's toll eventually as many are now finding out. GOOD LUCK>..be happy and Money sure as heck, doesn't buy happiness,even though it helps..|`|nuBRcuwvaa	Hahaha... it isn't about how much you make.  It is about how much you spend.<br>  <br>  There are many of us that live on 1/2 of that and get by just fine.  My family included.  We own a house, a vehicle and everything we "need."  No we don't have IPOD's and big screen tv's.  We dont' go to Disney Land for vacation, but we are more than happy enough in our little life.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	People have a tendency to spend up to and more then they make.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	We're retired and live on about a third of that.|`|XOtOMncwaa	Like everyone else said it really depends on where you live. My sister lives near baltimore, they have about the same income, and they really have a tight budget. I live in KY and my fiance makes a little more than that, and we live great, granted we do live in a 2 bedroom apartment for $200 a month, so we save alot, and we don't go crazy on spending, but if something big broke like a washer or a dryer, or my car broke down we would have no problem coming up with the money, and we don't really have to worry about bills either. It all really depends on what kind of bills you will have, and how you manage your money.|`|3ozaCLYqaa	Depending on where you live, I think you should be fine.  My mom isn't married and she only makes about $45,000/year and we are very comfortable.  The only thing is - we don't own our home, but we are able to rent a brand new house and have a couple of new cars.  I'll admit that there are times in which she has to say "no" to buying me something.<br>  <br>  But overall, we're good.<br>  So you should be comfortable too.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	It really depends on how much debt you have and what bills you have and what you consider "comfortable".  My husband is making a bit less than that, and I'm staying home with our son, and I'll tell you, it's a bit of a struggle.  We are trying to pay down our debt and do other things to reduce our monthly output, but it's tough!|`|evB63qWvaa	It really depends on where you live because the cost of living in places vary.  However, I would say that 90k a year is definitely a comfortable living, but then again, that also depends on the number of children you have too.|`|7IHMjy2caa	It depends on your lifestyle. <br>  <br>  I provide for my daughter on less then 40,000 a year. Things are tight sometimes, but I'm always able to make the bills. That being said, we don't eat out often, I don't buy her a toy every time we go out, and our vacations are spent at the family cabin near a lake. Still my child is happy and well taken care of.|`|JsqMSU9Haa	depends where and how you live. if you live modestly, it will be fine - but money goes quickly.  remember 90k - if both of you work, childcare costs a lot.  you can live comfortably if you make wise decisions.  people live on a lot less.|`|CzS1EiV9aa	Depends where you live for the cost of living.  In Los Angeles it goes quick if you buy a house.|`|AR683Nz6aa	as long as you spend reasonably then should be plenty
CC3zsp7qaa	Go to the doctors. You could have a bladder infection or urinary tract infection.    This is not a symptom or sign of pregnancy.|`|gRcVgmxVaa	It does sound like a UTI, bladder infection or possible bacterial vaginosis. If you are pregnant there is no home-made pregnancy test. If you had a spotty cycle it could be you are already pregnant and further along depending on if you had unprotected sex the previous month.  It's best to go get checked out NOW.|`|OuI5eFcmaa	It sounds like you have a UTI (urinary tract infection).  You can be pregnant and still get your period. I would reccomend going to the Dr. If money is an issue go to planned parenthood.  A Dr. can determine pregnancy and give you meds for the UTI.  Until the drink a lot of cranberry juice and maybe try AZO (it's an OTC pill to help calm the burning of a UTI.) and buy an at home test.|`|8lchebCNaa	doesnt sound like just pregnancy symptoms.. c the doc! to ease your mind u dont need stress while prego! good luk|`|KozoNqpsaa	First of all, there is no home made pregnancy test. If there was, many companies would go out of business! Second, you may have a UTI (urinary tract infection) which is what your symptoms sound like. UTI's are very common all throughout a pregnancy, so with having an odd, short period and these other symptoms, you might be pregnant. Go and buy a store brand hpt from Target or Walgreens and use first morning pee. Whatever the result, you need to see a doctor ASAP and get your infection cleared up.    Good luck!|`|d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	That's from one of two things~~neither of which is pregnancy related.     First of all, I've had more than one UTI over the course of my life and know how bad those feel. They burn when you pee, I mean BURN. If you have one your urine will likely smell different than usual too. You will feel the need to pee frequently and it will most likely be in small amounts. If it's a UTI, you may feel temporary relief from taking a warm bath in baking soda (arm and hammer stuff). It helps to drink lots of cranberry juice and AZO can help but antibiotics are the only thing to cure it.    Also, you can burn when you pee from a yeast infection too. If it was severe enough, the symptoms can mimic the UTI too with the painful urination and the burning and itching that you described.     As for the home made pregnancy tests, there isn't one. Go to the nearest dollar store or discount store to buy your test.    Good luck!|`|ntdGOZqGaa	um no, you have to buy a test which you can get them at the dollar store for a dollar. sounds like to me you either have a yeast infection or an STD. This is my second pregnancy and I have never had those sort of symptoms just from being pregnant, i was having to take antibiotics bc of a bad UTI and it gave me a yeast infection. Hope this helps some.|`|627pWyVkaa	If they had home made tests, Pregnancy tests wouldnt be such a good business would it? No not unless your a labratory technician and have a lab so you can test your own blood or urine. And it is probably a little to early to tell if you are pregnant. Your period can be old blood as well, colouring doesnt really matter. And You wouldnt be having cravings if you were only 2 weeks pregnant. Sorry its in your head-. It burns because you STILL have your yeast infection. However if you did NOT have a doctor test you for this, you may have a UTI and Not a yeast infection, or an STD. Sounds like you really need to get checked out. Go to a planned parenting for these things, get on birth control and be careful. If not look in your yellowpages or whitepages whatever you have, phone book for clinics, and sexual health clinics as they would be the cheapest or free even if that is the problem.|`|qeQVyLW7aa	if you are pregnant you could of had a miscarrage because when your pregnant and you have very heavy dark bleeding something bad happened.|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	If you are having these kind of symptoms...you probably should be seeing your doctor...sounds like a urinary infection or maybe the yeast infection is still there.
HgapOaPgaa	Try using separate paragraphs and indentations- it makes things much easier to read.     Also, try using proper tense, ex: "From that point on, I actually realized that Bryan is going to stick with me for the rest of my life, because we are perfect." is written in past tense, until you come to "...because we are perfect." Change 'are' to 'were' and keep a lookout for those kinds of little things and it will be great :)    Edited to suit your added details:    If that is only the first paragraph in the chapter, then yes, you do have a lot of work to do. It seems a little too rushed and crammed for a simple paragraph. Try going into detail about why Bryan and Nicky are so perfect for each other and how strongly they feel.|`|MigBOiUPaa	yea its ok. at first i thought it was a poem becuz the begining rhymes|`|kRaVa0Wraa	pretty good, but its quite confusing. develop more of an opening/beginning and it will be great!|`|GGH0HVdvaa	very very very amateur. it needs a lot of work.|`|e1cf5a783f548627eba8be4d2c8409caaa	It sounds like a 16 year old girl - naive, and relatively innocent.    I guess it's good.  It depends on your intended audience.  The writing is all right - not an epic fail, though you can improve.      This paragraph needs to be divided into smaller paragraphs.  Every time another character speaks, it's a new paragraph, as well as every time you change the subject.    Don't edit too much now - finish writing out what's in your head, then go back.  If you go back now, you might look at it critically and dump it and it will never get done.|`|gILygKvRaa	hard to follow|`|dIxQ9rV5aa	It was good enough that I didn't realize it was a work of fiction until I got to the bottom.    Now that I understand that, I think it would actually make a good hook, to catch the reader, and make them want to see how this problem will be solved, so they'll buy the book.|`|da2KJ9fXaa	its too confusing i had to read it twice.|`|MA3KcLUJaa	Hm.  I've read better.  Work on it.|`|8lchebCNaa	great!|`|JERUmEFzaa	This is pretty awesome!|`|Iek7D2hOaa	you keep using; bryan asked, i asked, bryan said, i said.  it gets repetitive and boring.  try and vary them, and add more description .  i personally think it needs alot more work.    and from what you have there, the whole plot line seems pretty cliche.  the things the people are saying are pretty unrealistic.  i know you're trying to make it sound sweet, but it's a bit too much.|`|MP7KFFTmaa	if you get rid of some repeated words and make it flow better, it'd be really good!|`|BYTPpcNZaa	hmm sounds interesting. whats it called?|`|MGEYaehVaa	a little confusing, but over all it's really good.  When you finish the book, could you email it to me?  I'd love to read more.|`|DN9RZHi3aa	i think that u should make David do something else, a normal person woouldnt go up to a girl they like who was making out with her boyfriend and say hey, wtf r u doin, i love you, its not normal, do something more original at that part
oiJITSNZaa	I would put pullups on him. My almost 4 year old too has diarrhea this week. He is totally potty trained with never an accident. But with diarrhea you know how difficult it is for adults to make it sometimes:( not to mention lil tots. I put pullups on him and explain that this is just in case you have an accident but you must try to run to the potty if you need to go and he does really good. Sure he's had a few accidents and am I ever glad I didn't need to clean up big boy shorts!|`|4ZnrBThaaa	When this happened with my daughter I went to pull ups. It made clean up MUCh easier and helped her also. When she was better, we returned to potty training again for a few days only though..... I gave her an extra treat (which I usually DIDN'T do) so she was so proud of herself. The next time she got sick, she did great and the pull ups went bye-bye!|`|FzWzHRKSaa	I wouldn't put him back in diapers, but maybe you should try pull ups.  At least they are a combination diaper/underwear.  Your son will think it is underwear and not rely on having a diaper on, but you will be able to clean him better with the pull up.  Hope he feels better soon....|`|hNIof0lbaa	I think it would be a good idea to possibly put him in a pull up/diaper until the diarrhea subsides. Let him know that its ok that hes not making it, its not really his fault, but you dont want his accident to go everywhere...! So thats why your putting him in a pull up or diaper, only because he is sick. Tell him that when he feels better, he can go to the potty again. It worked for my daughter when she was in her early 3's, I think its really hard for boys to get use to potty training though. Im sure more people will give you tips as well! Dont think your going in reverse though...hes sick, theres only a number of things you can do!|`|iu4SOin3aa	Try the pull ups, or move the potty closer to him (if you have one of the trainer pottys). <br>  <br>  Make sure to give him lots of fluids, and maybe the diarrhea will ease up.
UMzd6FHWaa	He's a teenager. It's his job to be stroppy.|`|869328b32e030e92c8be316b6b2b83ebaa	I have a sneaky feeling that skybloom was right.  He wants to be able to show off that he has a girl following and cling onto him.  As you said, before, you were "often just around instead or with them" instead of with him.  <br>  You are his trophy and he is not happy that his mates think he has lost his moll (trophy) when he goes out.<br>  Stick to your gun.  Stay at home, like your friends, and revise your homework.  You won't regret it.|`|piDDZ6Ywaa	He is probably moody because he knows you just want it to be you, and him. If you both are always together, maybe you should give him a bit of air and let him hang out with his boyfriends, other then that. Just tell him how you feel. He probably doesn't mean how he is acting (:|`|m5eNnMwzaa	I would say he was being off with you because he might have liked you to cling to him even though his mates are oing he might have wanted to spend ime with u|`|6W7nJYskaa	He's being a baby that's why lol :-)|`|LMRaSXFeaa	cause he wants you to go with him, and hed probably like if you clung to him.|`|Rs3ITS1Iaa	maybe bescause of what u did last Saturday. U know.... With john|`|tg89r7ZJaa	why would you not want to be with him that's his problem your not wanting to hang out with him my fiance is the same way btw im 16 and he's almost 18 and he wants me around him all the time and i love being around him all the time so go with him!|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Maybe he thinks you just don't want to go with him. Just tell him you thought he'd have more fun with his mates, but you'd love to go spend time with him if he wants you there?|`|MHg9JhEKaa	No, you'll have to ask him my love. It may or may not have anything to do with tonight.|`|GUuFKaaiaa	maybe he wanted to show u off or something

pXSKSS3daa	How are you making the formula? That raises concern for me if you think it's too watery(meaning it's not made properly and too much water in an infant can lead to water intoxication). As long as you are following the instructions on the can then it should be fine.<br>  <br>  He has a well baby appointment coming up, right? I'd speak with his pediatrician about starting solids then. Most suggest starting rice cereal at 4 months anyway. If he's not up to 8 oz. just yet then try it out and see if that tides him over. Noah, at one point, was taking in 8 oz. at a time. That lasted for a couple of months and then he went down to 7. Now, at almost 11 months, he only drinks 5 oz. at a time.|`|eu6UQElYaa	Really pediatricians want parents to start waiting until 6 months until they introduce solid foods including baby cereal (and you shouldn't introduce baby cereal in a baby bottle as that can contribute to choking).   <br>  However, I had my daughter before that recommendation really took hold and we started her on solid baby cereal at 4 months because she had good head control and nobody was really telling us not too.   <br>  SO really you could go two ways with this when he gets to the point where 8 oz. is no longer enough.  You could either just offer him more formula, which would be absolutely fine or you could offer him small amounts of baby rice cereal and see how he does with it (again only try it if he has good head control).|`|vue9NOhYaa	Yes, that could be the problem.  You need to be following the instructions on the can carefully.<br>  <br>  If he's still hungry after you make the formula according to directions... offer more formula.  He's still too young for solids.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	If he can eat cereal from a baby spoon and not choke on it, he'll be fine.  Give it a shot.  My 2nd started solids at 4 months and my 3rd at 3 months|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	No overfeeding isn't a good reason to give a baby cereal.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a..." rel="nofollow">http://www.drgreene.org/body.cfm?id=21&a...</a><br>  I’m much more concerned about a subtler issue. Babies are born with a wonderful mechanism for knowing how much food they need. During the early months, they take their cues from the volume of what they drink. Adding cereal derails this mechanism. It forces them to take in deceptively large amounts of calories. It teaches them to overeat.<br>  <br>  By starting with a spoon, resting between bites, and stopping when your child lets you know he’s full, you will be laying an excellent foundation for good eating habits throughout his life.<br>  <br>  A major study looking for the causes of obesity found that short-circuiting young children’s self-regulation of how much they eat is a major cause of later obesity.1 Cereal in the bottle does just that.<br>  <br>  Babies that are fed this way may appear to be unaffected – but those few weeks of added convenience may result in a lifetime of struggles with weight. This common practice may have contributed to our being the most obese generation in history.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g..." rel="nofollow">http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g...</a><br>  For many babies the urge to suck is strong during these early months and your baby's need to suck may extend beyond his need for nourishment. For a bottle fed baby there is an increased risk of overfeeding if his sucking urge is misinterpreted as a sign of hunger<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g..." rel="nofollow">http://www.babycareadvice.com/babycare/g...</a><br>  Overfeeding is a common problem for bottle fed babies because many young babies cannot control the flow of milk though an artificial nipple and/or cannot indicate when they have had enough. A baby's digestive system can become overloaded when it receives excessive amounts of milk from large volume feeds or frequent feeding patterns. The larger the volume of milk, the quicker it passes through the digestive tract. Large volumes of milk may pass through a baby's small intestine too quickly for all of the lactose to be digested.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ncane.com/vo5" rel="nofollow">http://ncane.com/vo5</a><br>  It is easy for a new parent to say that they won’t break these feeding rules; however, the reality is that the temptation to quickly quiet a crying baby in the middle of the night so that the parents can garner more sleep can overcome even the most diligent of parents. Even with the determination to never do it again, parents may turn to that late night bottle more and more simply because it works and allows the parent to go back to bed quicker. During the day when the parent may be too busy to take time out to calm the infant, the parent may give the infant a bottle, figuring that the child is hungry. To some, food is the quickest and easiest solution to quiet tears and screams.<br>  <br>  While the effects may not show right away, they can have an effect on the infant later on in life. Children who are overfed as infants have a greater chance of becoming obese as teenagers and adults. With the rising rate of obesity in children on the rise, it is best to try and curb this possibility when the child is very young. By prolonging the introduction of solids or any foods beyond formula until about six months, the parents have the best chance at keeping their child off the obese path at a young age. After the child is eating solids, it is best to keep away sugary foods. Young children do not need these empty calories as a part of their daily nutritional intake. Obesity, however, is the main concern for the future of the infant. Overfeeding can cause the infant to rely on food more constantly than the average child, thus increasing his or her food intake. If unnecessary, sugary foods are added to an infant’s diet, this too can add to the obesity factor.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,3764,0..." rel="nofollow">http://www.drspock.com/faq/0,1511,3764,0...</a><br>  ANSWER<br>  August 3, 2001<br>  Dear Dad,<br>  Yes, it is possible to overfeed a four-week-old infant since it's easy to misinterpret a baby's hunger and satiety (fullness) signals. When full, babies will stop sucking, turn their heads or push the nipple out of their mouths as a signal. Babies who are overfed often are uncomfortable and irritable. More importantly, they sometimes loose the ability to recognize when they are hungry. Parents will want to start out from the beginning to allow their baby to signal hunger and have it responded to appropriately.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lpch.org/HealthLibrary/Parent..." rel="nofollow">http://www.lpch.org/HealthLibrary/Parent...</a><br>  # The maximal amount of formula recommended per day is 32 ounces (1 liter).<br>  # Overfeeding can cause vomiting, diarrhea or excessive weight gain.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  # The average amount of formula (in ounces) that babies take per feeding usually equals the baby's weight (in pounds) divided in half (or equal to the weight in kg).<br>  # The average ounces of formula the baby takes in 24 hours is the baby's weight in pounds multiplied by 2 (or kg multiplied by 4).<br>  # A baby's appetite varies throughout the day.

Rome and Rogers say nature|`|n0WnEIopaa	For sure he would get more hungry if you mix in too much water. Because everything he needs is in the powdery part, not the water. <br>  Then it becomes dangerous because a babies kidneys aren't developed enough to process the excess water. The sodium content is also diluted and CAN cause seizures. <br>  <br>  Same thing as if you are super hungry, water won't fill you up. Maybe fill your belly for a few minutes, but your hunger would come right back. <br>  <br>  I would start off by correctly mixing formula. Because that could change everything.<br>  <br>  NEVER mix cereal into a bottle; <br>  <br>  It is a major choking hazard.<br>  <br>  It can cause obesity.<br>  <br>  His stomach isn't ready for digesting solids, babies need milk(formula/breastmilk), not cereal until 6 months, he is way too young!<br>  <br>  Lastly giving cereal before 6 months isn't a good idea. Introducing them sooner then that can cause your baby;<br>  - allergies<br>  - to be overweight<br>  - makes starting solids harder on you and baby.<br>  I know starting solids is another milestone and fun to do, but a bit of fun isn't worth causing your baby allergies, obesity, and choking.|`|UEAzzroAaa	Yes the formula being too watery will make him hungry quicker. So definitely put the right amount of formula in. 8 ounces is a lot for 4 months. but every baby has their own appetite. My daughter is up to 5 ounces and she just turned 4 months yesterday. My doctor told me that it is too much for  her age, but im not going to starve her! You could try adding a bit of rice cereal to your babies formula bottles. It works to keep their bellies full longer. At 4 months of age it is okay to give cereal.. 6 months solids. If 8 ounces gets to be too little, then you will have to probably feed every 3 hours instead of 4, but I dont think that should happen if you give cereal in the bottle, or by spoon! Good luck..|`|14JQ11AUaa	Make sure to make the formula as directed! An 8oz bottle of water requires 4 scoops of formula. If he is still hungrier, start him on cereal! I added it to my sons bottle, like a teaspoon in a 7oz bottle. This will help him a lot, my son hates cereal...unless it is in his bottle lol. Remember, DO NOT put more than a teaspoon in a 7oz bottle or he wont be able to pull it through the nipple. As far as feeding him the cereal by spoon, why not...it is only a week away. I would not start him on anything else until you have the docs consent! Good luck :)<br>  <br>  Ps. It is better to do this in the night time, when you make his last bottle before bed time......he will sleep so good and for a lot longer :)|`|j98CkMzVaa	Try him with 9 ounces for a week or so. Then every morning give him a kind of ceral thing that comes in a box (2-3 small spoonfuls). The other problem could be that the food is not satisfying him. However buy one of the made up cereals and try him with it.|`|UXhFcHCHaa	i dont know if this will help but at a week before my son was 4 months i started rice because he seemed hungrier like you are describing. he did ok on the cereals and at 5 months he wanted more than the cereals and was now drinking 10 oz plus the cereals for a few days and i knew it was time to start him on baby food. it has held him down to 8 oz now. now he eats baby food half jar and a full bottle of milk. im like wow!!!|`|QCVzUC1baa	My son was taking 9oz every 3 hours when he was 16 weeks so i started him on baby rice. And he was fine I could tell he was ready.<br>  <br>  How do you make up a feed and what formula do you feed him?|`|b34544fc1adbb12a05af0930e6aca42caa	you should make the formula as directed. you will need to talk to ur ped about cereal mine does not want me to start till like 5 months...|`|gPg7qYGIaa	then it time to think about starting weaning my baby started weaning about the same age he 6 months now and loves his food|`|eS7iQCziaa	Feed him more or get a bigger bottle until he is satisfied.

lR1vbA1faa	"Heavy" bleeding and cramping usually means an early period. What you want to watch out for is the "light" bleeding (spotting) which occurs during implantation. Stress can cause you to get off your cycle, so I'd say your safe. By the way... if he gets in you at all, even for a second, you can still get pregnant. So be more careful next time, ok?|`|G29uS152aa	Was a condom used? There is always a chance when you have sex that you can get pregnant.  Just take a test to find out.  If the test is negative, and you still don't get your period by say the 15th take another.  These are reasons that you should be very very careful if you are going to be having sex at your age.  Best of luck to you.  Also try not to stress about it too much, it will only make it worse (I know that is easier said than done).|`|cpl396lKaa	no  im serious, sometimes my period will come like wayy early.  i think you are just on your period, but wait it out and see if it continues, if it doesn't then i suggest a pregnancy test. take it in like 2 or 3 weeks or so|`|dPzXLo9uaa	Honey, I don't think you're pregnant if you're bleeding.  Sometimes your periods can change if you're under a great deal of stress, or when you have sex, etc.  If you really think you may be pregnant, go get a pregnancy test and try that-they have some really accurate ones now-first response you can use the day after.  I would highly recommend going to the doctor, because the serious bleeding/cramping could be something more than you think.  While you're there, ask them about getting the pill too.  I would worry more about catching a disease from unprotected sex than getting pregnant by the way-even if you do get on the pill, you STILL need to use a condom-it's so important!|`|ZzoOl8xYaa	you are not pregnant. you got your period early. no biggie. it happens when your young. but if you dont even understand your body, you should notttt be having sex at all!|`|KwkEvmpPaa	well if you are pregnant the bleeding and and with heavy cramps thats not good that might be a miscarage and well you should wait about two to three weeks to take a test but it should be past the 9th of feburary|`|kV9YT6bSaa	You're only fourteen. You're gunna have a weird period once in a while.

The only thing that could keep you away was when you were in the hospital or you were dieing. If you are in another country just call them and say "Happy Birthday" that will show the kids you remember their birthday and they will appreciate. And as i have heard there is a wedding. Your birthday has more of a cost than the wedding. Your dad should celebrate it or even spend time. But mostly say Happy Birthday.

Even if I had some gal stones or kidney stones, I would tough it out, and believe me, Gal bladder stones are no joke, I had to have my gal bladder removed, and when you get as bad as I did, it feels like a heart attack or a boa is squeezing you to death, even then, I wouldn't miss thier special day. :)|`|YMdYyRmqaa	Nothing...so I am going to ramble a little bit here.  so I had two girls with my ex husband but I was cheating on him with a woman named monica (yes i am bisexual) and she had a boy tommy who is 3. well my daughter molly had her nineth birthday party about 2 months ago and her dad was a no show.  half way through the party...we were leaving to go to the house of bounce. I called him and said "where the F are you" he said "I dont want to come because your girlfriend and you makes me feel uncomfortable" I than found out he didnt ever buy her a gift. what an A word. He didnt come cuz he forgot about her birthday. wow    sorry but NO nothing would make me miss a little child birthday|`|Ez4d9g3vaa	My mom missed a couple of mine (I was a teenager) because she was in the hospital but I was still able to go visit her.

I missed my youngest daughter's 11th b-day as I was hospitalized 150 miles from home after an auto accident (broken leg, broken arm, broken jaw, and other minor injuries)...  I couldn't even talk to her on the phone because my mouth was wired shut and so swollen I could barely make a sound...      With the help of a kind nurse and a large alphabet chart I could point at even with drug induced clumsiness I sent her a couple text messages..  I told her we would do her b-day when I was up and moving again...  She told me she understood and thought I should get some rest... LOL|`|AA12221392	I had to miss my son's birthday  , when my baby was in the hospital with mengitis. I couldn't leave he was fighting for his life.

I remember because it broke my heart.|`|prqrQcd1aa	insanity?? I'd say the only thing that would cause it was i had dementia, was in the hospital in a coma, if i went crazy (hence the insanity) or if i were dead... i have 3 little girls!|`|yfcJwQr8aa	The only reason would be I would have to be hospitalized or dead.

WbJPQM1naa	Filing for joint or full custody of your son is possible.  The filing fees, however, vary from jurisdictions.  So, the best way to answer that question is to call the clerk of the court in your local juvenile court.  Use your search engine to look up the law of your state.  Here is a place to start:  http://law.findlaw.com/state-laws/state-...    Without an order of custody, you or she is legally entitled to time with the child.  Have you a signed agreement as to custody, or who makes important decisions for the child, or child support?  If so, you need to review this agreement.  If you signed something agreeing to allow her to have full custody of your son, this usually includes her right to make decisions about where he will live, his education and medical care.  If you have not been paying any child support, you might not get a good response from the court if you file for full custody.    It might, however, be possible to file with the court to simply request that she not take your son out of state.  Allowing her full custody, but within the area.  Be aware, however, that ANY filings with the court will probably automatically include the court ordering you to pay her child support.      Filing fees, as I said, can vary.  If you are indigent or unable to pay the filing costs, you can usually request a form to waive the fees.  So, check with the clerk about this.  Some states have their forms online as well as the law.  So, look for this resource when you search or call the clerk and ask this as well.  I wouldn't put much stock in your ability to win full custody, unless you are gainfully employed, have good childcare arrangements in place, have accomodations for your son.. meaning a place where he has his own room and bed.  Be aware, as well, that if you do seek this, your home will be investigated by an independent person asigned by the court.  In my divorce, the court ordered my ex to pay this person $1000. for their report.  So, this is another expense you have to consider.  Take good care, read the law and be informed, because KNOWLEDGE is POWER!    R|`|E9F6qjRWaa	if you have joint legal or physical custody of your son then she can not leave unless she has you permission.    if you dont have joint custody then go to the court asap and file for joint bc if a case is opened before she leaves then they may make her stay. but if you wait until she is gone then they may over rule it    and if your son is already 18 then it doesnt matter|`|356f8f209dcd6dc30f57b5bcaa4830f6aa	Well I would assume that custody rights vary from state to state.  The good thing is that you are listed as father.  Do you have the results of the paternity test?  The best thing that I could advise is to contact a lawyer that deals in child and family law.  If you are low income and if available in your state legal aid might be able to assist you.
2N6KEoVqaa	What are the causes of stillbirth?<br>  There are a number of known causes of stillbirth. Sometimes more than one of these causes may contribute to the baby’s death. Common causes include: <br>  <br>  Birth defects: About 15 to 20 percent of stillborn babies have one or more birth defects (1). Nearly half of these have genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome (1). Others have other birth defects resulting from genetic, environmental or unknown causes. <br>  <br>  Placental problems: Placental problems cause about 25 percent of stillbirths (3). One of the most common placental problems is placental abruption. In this condition, the placenta peels away, partly to almost completely, from the uterine wall before delivery. It results in heavy bleeding that can threaten the life of mother and baby. Sometimes it can cause the fetus to die from lack of oxygen. Women who smoke cigarettes or use cocaine during pregnancy are at increased risk of placental abruption. <br>  <br>  Poor fetal growth: Fetuses who are growing too slowly are at increased risk of stillbirth. About 40 percent of stillborn babies have poor growth (2). Women who smoke cigarettes or have high blood pressure are at increased risk of having a baby that grows too slowly. An ultrasound examination during pregnancy can show that the fetus is growing poorly, allowing health care providers to carefully monitor the pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Infections: Infections involving the mother, fetus or placenta appear to cause about 10 to 25 percent of stillbirths (4, 5). Infections are an important cause of fetal deaths before 28 weeks of pregnancy (4). Some infections may cause no symptoms in the pregnant woman. These include genital and urinary tract infections and certain viruses, such as fifth disease (parvovirus infection). These infections may go undiagnosed until they cause serious complications, such as fetal death or preterm birth (before 37 completed weeks of pregnancy). <br>  <br>  Chronic health conditions in the pregnant woman: About 10 percent of stillbirths are related to chronic health conditions in the mother, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, kidney disease and thrombophilias (blood clotting disorders) (5). These conditions may contribute to poor fetal growth or placental abruption. <br>  <br>  Umbilical cord accidents: Accidents involving the umbilical cord may contribute to about 2 to 4 percent of stillbirths (3). These include a knot in the cord or abnormal placement of the cord into the placenta. These can deprive the fetus of oxygen. <br>  <br>  Other causes of stillbirth include trauma (such as car accidents), postdate pregnancy (a pregnancy that lasts longer than 42 weeks), Rh disease (an incompatibility between the blood of mother and baby), and lack of oxygen (asphyxia) during a difficult delivery. These causes are uncommon.<br>  <br>  There is more information at the march of dimes website.|`|eabe4c3a6e53ede1a2078c8d7dfcf4b7aa	cord can get wrapped around the baby's neck for one...actually when I had Jacob there was a girl who's baby was a still born BUT was revived! She was in the breastfeeding class that was offered to new moms and dads.|`|AA10196172	A serious cause of still births is "meconium aspiration". <br>  <br>  Talk about major yuck factor...<br>  <br>  It's a big risk when the baby is too long overdue. Basically, meconuin is a fancy word for when the baby has a poop in the amniotic fluid, and aspiration means it gets into the mouth and blocks the airway. The baby then chokes when it's supposed to start breathing.  This happened to the sister of someone my wife worked with.<br>  <br>  Other problems have to do with the placenta not supplying enough oxygen sometimes because it's ripping away from the uterus wall. There's also the cord wrapping around the neck and strangling the baby, or getting twisted and blocked or somehow the oxygen/blood flow is cut off. <br>  <br>  When you consider all the things that can possibly go wrong, it's amazing that 99% of the time things go just fine.|`|KOwzDLPdaa	Still births can happen at any time without any known valid medical reason, even after a perfectly healthy pregnancy. The are tragic and unavoidable. If its going to happen, it will. But the chances are so low that you should be just fine if you have had an otherwise healthy pregnancy.|`|AA10830003	A still born is when you baby comes out dead.<br>  But anything can cause it to happen.<br>  Like if you didnt know that you weree pregnant<br>  And you wasnt take caere of your body as you should!|`|AA10063059	eclampsia,strangulation with cord,distress in labor,detached placenta,birth defects,

qeQVyLW7aa	If I were you I would be straight and honest with them because they are your parents and they should know what you are going through right now. They might of went through it. Tell them that you are trying to save money and ask them to either lower the bills you pay or explain to them that they cant take your whole check. Ask them if they want you and your husband to live with them for a longer period of time. Maybe they will give in to you.|`|99393e431ca2807b40ff692bfff6c2d5aa	my husband and i went through a similar situation. we found that sitting and talking it over without seeming to put out worked alright. its better to just be honest but nice.
PRQyeOHUaa	Im 19 right now. I already have an 11 month old son, I got pregnant for the first time when I was 17 too =P I am now almost 5 months pregnant with my second child ... Neither of them were planned, however we didn't use protection and always knew there were possibilities... I was extremely anxious to test with both!! With my first I tested the day my period was due and got 2 positives...with my second I got a negative on the day my period was due and a positive 2 weeks later. I would say dont skimp on quality...get a name brand pregnancy test...I know they all say 99.9% accurate but I used a no name brand and got a negative when I was in fact preggers  =P... I know people think Im too young but I feel as long as you feel ready you'd be surprised what challenges you can take on including motherhood...dont let anyone put you down or discourage you! To tell parents...Well my mom and I are close so I told her at my first pre natal appointment when I was pregnant with my son...my dad I wrote a note to :| and everyone else found out from my mom...I was surprised with the support I recieved. When I found out I was preggers again it was easier...since I already had a son. But take care of yourself, be happy and healthy and I wish you the best |`|tbZNMfAsaa	well 17 is NOT ideal. I am soooooo glad I didn't have kids that young|`|E9F6qjRWaa	omg so am i i can test on the 12th!!  just relax and go about your life as if you were'nt waiting for something  ummm...depends how old are you?
8WbfmK5daa	I went too school with a girl named Keziah and they use to take the mick out of her for it calling her Crazi-ah or it was never prounounced right just cause of that reason I don't like it too much.<br>  <br>  I like Sarai though that is really cute.<br>  <br>  Kimaya and Jael are both quite nice as well.|`|zfZiXQ3Oaa	I love Sarai, and Jael is also nice|`|243bff959375fe2757f750ec38cc8274aa	Keziah isn't usually pronounced like that.  I knew a couple of Dutch gals with that name.  I like the Dutch way a lot better.  It sounds really awkward with the pronunciation you gave.  <br>  <br>  Sarai is nice.  <br>  <br>  Kimaya looks weird... like pseudo-Asian.  <br>  <br>  Jael isn't good looking and will be a b**** to pronounce.|`|w0eRRsoVaa	If you're in the States, those names aren't going to be pronounced the way you want them to...other than Sarai.  Keziah will be pronounced Kez-ai-ah, Kimaya will be pronounced Kim-ai-ah, Jael will be pronounced Jay-el.<br>  <br>  If you want them to be pronounced properly, spell it that way you would pronounce it , i.e. Kezeah, Keymaya/Keimaya.<br>  <br>  The only one I can stand is Sarai.|`|CRvdmFwCaa	Keziah (pro.: keh ZEE ah): I like how it is spelled... But it's probably my least favorite on the list. Not sure why... <br>  Sarai (pro.:sah RYE) : this is my #2 Favorite... Just very pretty.<br>  Kimaya (pro.:kee may ah): This is my cousin's name and she is has a BIG personality and is very smart... so when I think of this I think of strong.<br>  Jael (pro.: yah EL): This is my #1 Favorite... It's very Pretty.|`|htSZsds7aa	Sorry I dont like any of them..Remember kids have to grow up with wierd names and be teased. It also lends itself to pronounciation problems...u even had to show us how to pronounce them.|`|wdXQaATDaa	Sorry, but I don't like any of them.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	I love Sarai. I also think Keziah is kinda neat.

I guess people forget that people will ask what the child's name is (when they are younger, before they get school age). If you give them your pronunciation, they will pronounce it the way you gave them. When they are school age, when the teacher calls roll, if you attended the parent-teacher meet and greet thing before school starts, the teacher will know the pronunciation. If there is no meet and greet before school starts, then when the teacher pronounces the name wrong the child will correct them. It's not that hard. Americans can be so closed minded...we are not the only culture on the face of the planet people!! GEEZ!|`|76hhm6Quaa	nobody will ever pronounce them the way you want them to be, they are all unique and pretty names but your child will have one of these names for their whole life, so as you pick a name keep that child in mind.|`|1xsUVtzBaa	I like Sarai or another...Sarita|`|rajT9LD5aa	honey please do not name ne or your children these names they are rediculous|`|hl7Tqxjgaa	i like sarai|`|tTDvpuGPaa	I love Sarai.|`|DhmjLRoUaa	Made up

But, I like Cody better.|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I like cody, kyle is nice too. both great choices|`|heDtLdz5aa	my oldest (13 year old step-son) his name is cody so i am partial to that...ha ha|`|TEMriZfkaa	those are cute. but so is caden|`|Fx77zYhWaa	I like them both.  Too bad they don't sound good together of you could use one as a first name and one as a middle.
8lchebCNaa	if u did it last time in 3 weeks and usually with the second woman heal faster, so im guessing when ever u feel ready... the docs can never tell if u have had sex or not at your 6 week check up... its up to u its your body!   :)|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	just give your doc a ring- my sister got the ok early on becausee she was not bleeding and felt great|`|r52rfBkeaa	I'm going to give the typical doc-type answer - 6 weeks.  You may feel fine, but your body just went through major trauma and needs to heal.  There's a reason why they tell us to wait... it's not just to torture us now that our hormones have gone back to normal again. ;)|`|jNqf8HtDaa	they say 6 weeks because of stitches and healing but i think you can do it when your ready but then again i would wait a little bit so you can get tighter and you both can enjoy it more|`|jNgh3e3Faa	Go for it. I waited 11 days after my c-sections. Bleeding stopped after 9 or 10 days.   Just make sure you are on birth control!  Good luck.   Congrats on your baby!|`|qeQVyLW7aa	My doctor said that I could have sex when I was ready. Me and my husband had sex 6-9 weeks after I had my son. Yes, it hurt at first but after a while the pain goes away. It was extremely painful the first time.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	Wait until after your 6 week check-up...  While you feel fine and bleeding has stopped your body still needs healing time.... Especially the interior of your uterus where the placenta was attached...   Sex can push bacterias up into the vagina and cause an infection in the uterus even after bleeding has stopped....|`|V9pZ0t8Saa	when ever YOU feel ready just be gentle|`|6e1c76f74210d8827812865d861882adaa	whenever you want as long as you have no pain. be careful though you are very fertile.|`|eD0MVJxUaa	I'm jealous.  That's great that there was no tearing and you feel fine.  Normally they say 6 weeks before the no sex thing but if you're feeling fine then don't worry about it.  Tons of women never wait that long.  Just remember though, you can get pregnant easier right now so take precautions.  Have fun! :)|`|d6df9c3bab13d4a609d4641b785de6b0aa	The reason they tell you to wait until after your 6 week postpartum appointment, is bc in no way is your body ready to handle another pregnancy before that. Also bc your Dr will give you a pelvic exam to check and make sure you have healed properly and are ready to resume sex and get you on some birth control. But if you are careful and use good protection and there is no pain, then do what you want. I would wait though.|`|9Mr14w6Qaa	Usually most Doctors want you to wait until your six week checkup.Also I am sure that you should b e using protection if you do decide to go ahead.
vJEatJFPaa	Yes..sometimes the formula leaves a little film over their tongues....just keep cleaning your babies mouth out with a wet wash cloth here and there.|`|fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	If it wipes off its not thrush, that I agree with (though a small amount of thrush can loosen most would stick).<br>  <br>  Is it a sort of even coating on the tongue?  Does the tongue look hairy?  Is it just patches?  Does it look like curds?|`|EFYkci30aa	My 2 1/2 month old has the same thing. . .I think it's just formula coming back up and sticking.  It freaked me out at first, but it wipes off and it's not always there (but it is a lot of the time).|`|PLgNsOF9aa	Hi. I have seen thrush on others infants, but not my own. I have to say that if it is thrush you will know the difference from milk sticking and thrush. Its not smooth looking like milk on a tongue and definately will not wipe off.|`|GGBDkOuFaa	yup, its forumla. I wouldnt worry about it!
8WRnqs08aa	My baby began teething early, but did not actually break her first tooth until she was 6 months (she's 5 days shy of 8 months now) Sounds like it could be teething. I use orajel. They offer a day & a night formula. The night formula is a tiny bit stronger. I also would give her a dose of tylenol before bed, and she would sleep more comfortably. During the day I would give her a dose of tylenol only if she seemed to really need it. When I apply the orajel, I rub, rub, rub the gel into her gums. At first she would cry, but then as the med began to numb her gum, she'd enjoy the rubbing of her gums and get happy again. I give her plenty of teething toys. It's a little more difficult for you, as your baby probably is still to young to put objects in his mouth, so I use to hold the object to my baby's mouth and let her naw on it.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't seem to help, then you should seek the advice of his pediatrician.<br>  <br>  *** Let me add that when my children have teethed, they've gotten diarrhea and sometimes ear infections, so you may want to visit the Dr. to rule out an inner ear infection***<br>  <br>  Best of Luck.<br>  <br>  <br>  Mother to 4 beautiful children with Twins due Sept. 2009 (Babies # 5 & 6)|`|nmu6coapaa	Ok my son went through a few stages of this too! He had thrush the first  time and eventually discovered he had acid reflux! I think maybe a little visit to the docs might be needed!

As long as he is peeing and the pee isn't dark then I wouldn't be concerned about how much he is eating, though if it stays below 20oz per day for a week you should probably at least call the doctor.<br>  <br>  Above all listen to your gut.  If you think he needs medical attention then get it.  If you think he is in pain be concerned.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/t081500.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/t081500...</a><br>  WHAT IS DIARRHEA?<br>  <br>  There are two components to the definition of diarrhea:<br>  <br>      * Frequency – it is normal for an infant to have stools up to 10 times a day, although most don't attain this goal. The frequency will slow down as baby gets older, but even some toddlers and preschoolers still go several times a day. An increase in frequency of one-and-a-half or two times your child's normal pattern is considered abnormal.<br>      * Consistency – again, it's important to know what your child's stools usually look like. If the stools become looser, watery, mucusy, green, or runnier than usual, this is considered a significant change.<br>  <br>  WHAT DIARRHEA IS NOT<br>  <br>      * Newborns often stool 8 – 10 times a day, sometimes passing small, watery stools mixed with yellow, seedy pieces. They also may have several stools each day that are runnier and more mucusy than usual. These are all normal variations and are not a cause for concern.<br>      * Infants may occasionally have one or several stools that are much more loose and foul smelling than usual. This is probably due to a variation in diet or may be for no reason at all. It is not a cause for concern.<br>      * Some infants may have persistent loose, runny stools that never seem to firm up into a normal stool. This can go on for one or two weeks. As long as your child is thriving, not acting sick, and your pediatrician reassures you that your child is well, then there is little reason for concern.<br>  <br>  [...]<br>  <br>  WHEN TO WORRY: What to do<br>  <br>  Here are several signs that warrant an appointment with your doctor within a day:<br>  <br>      * Bloody diarrhea. This can be a sign of a bacterial illness or an allergy. Contact your doctor.<br>      * Moderate to severe dehydration – click on Dehydration for guidelines.<br>      * Severe diarrhea as defined above. Child is acting lethargic (defined as limp, and less responsive to touch or words, won't focus on you).<br>      * Increased abdominal pain.<br>      * Continued weight loss.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T081300.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdrsears.com/html/8/T081300...</a><br>  WHEN TO BE CONCERNED<br>  <br>  MODERATE DEHYDRATION – many children will progress to this stage during a gastrointestinal illness. In general, this stage is not dangerous either. Signs include:<br>  <br>      * Less active and playful, but still alert.<br>      * Will make eye contact and respond to you<br>      * Lips are dry and chapped, inside of mouth is slightly dry<br>      * No tears when crying, but eyes still appear moist<br>      * Urinating about half as often as usual<br>      * Urine concentrated like apple juice<br>  <br>  WHEN TO SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION<br>  <br>  SEVERE DEHYDRATION – seek medical attention if your child shows these signs:<br>  <br>      * Limp, inactive, makes minimal eye contact and not response to your voice or touch. This is the definition of lethargic.<br>      * Lips chapped, inside of mouth is dry and sticky with no saliva<br>      * No tears, eyes are dry and sunken in<br>      * No urination for 12 – 18 hours<br>      * Extremely unusual fussiness along with the other symptoms<br>      * Pale<br>      * Very fast heartbeat<br>  <br>  NOTE: A child is more likely to get severely dehydrated with vomiting and diarrhea – dubbed a "double-ender" than with either alone<br>  GETTING THROUGH THE NIGHT<br>  <br>  Mild or moderate dehydration –most children can make it through the evening and overnight by offering your child small, frequent sips of clear liquids such as:<br>  <br>      * Breast milk<br>      * White grape juice<br>      * Pedialyte<br>      * Frozen juice slushy <br>  <br>  Severe dehydration is too dangerous to treat at home and should be treated immediately in an emergency room.<br>  <br>  Above all, if you are not sure about how dehydrated your child is, you should contact your doctor.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	Sounds like one or two things could be going on. One, does your baby have white bumps in his cheeks or on his tongue? This is called thrush and common in infants. This condition is easily curable but causes pain when sucking.<br>  Two,  your infant may have an ear infection which causes the night crying and lack of sucking his bottle. <br>  At this young an age I would indeed take your son to the doctor to be seen. It is possible to be getting a tooth, but very rare indeed.
fHgbL046aa	I am 17 weeks pregnant and I take 300mg of effexor and 50mg of trazodone. It is because of anxiety and panic attacks. I would LOVE not to take the medication but I would not be able to function without them.   My doctor has said there are no real studies of women taking antidepressants. Some women take them and have healthy babies and some women don't.   I've heard some people take low dosage of Prozac or Zoloft and believe they are on the best antidepressants. I can't say for sure if your medication is okay or not. I Googled a lot of information about my medication and pregnancy. You can do the same thing and of course speak with your doctor.   I know nothing about smoking because I don't smoke. I've heard it is really hard to quite.This one girl I know(not sure if she was telling the truth) said her doctor told her to cut back smoking because it would harm the baby if you quite cold turkey. I'm not sure about that though.  Good Luck and Congratulations|`|xHKRGEg4aa	hey hun, try to at least slow down smoking, but if you cant quit, dont let everyone bash you for it. My mom smoked through all four of her pregnancies & we all came out just fine.  Now, Idk about ativan, but Klonopin, while thats a very nice feel good pill, I wouldnt suggest taking any more.   I'm sure your baby will be fine, but stop taking the meds unless your doctor tells you to take them for something specific, but even then, I wouldnt take them.  Good luck & best wishes!|`|m0a7Ox1maa	speak to your doctor about the med    or google effects|`|qM5JiI56aa	OMG!!! Stop smoking!! And why do you take those meds? If they aren't necessary then stop taking them.|`|irGE84Qdaa	u have DR to ask ain't u?ask ur DR all abt that and dont take any medicine without asking her did u tell her that u r using these medicine if not then tell her and i m not sure what to say cuz i dont wanted to use any depression or anxiety medicine during my pregnancy i just took em for 3 days and now i just control my anxiety v well without taking any medicine and my depression is gone cuz of my efforts and m fine now 35 weeks pregnant but many out there take medicine for anxiety and their baby just come out fine u,ll get more answers dont worry and ask ur Dr plz plz.|`|cr1cUCKVaa	being in the process of stopping smoking means nothing. jst stop it. smoking can make the umbillical cord short, have less fluid, prevent baby from growing at a normal pace, etc.   stop smoking. and tell the doctor about ur Ativan he or she should be informed

faPKwClPaa	She's just going to have to adjust, sorry.  Our son's day care is the same way -- one big room with one section for the beds -- and I know he doesn't get the best rest there because of the noise.<br>  <br>  Maybe it's just the new place and faces and toys and such that's distracting her from sleeping.  Maybe in a couple more weeks, that will all be 'old news' and she can rest better.|`|lFlapW8maa	she's a kid she will adjust.  chill out.  stop being such a stickler about the naps.  she will nap if she is really tired.  i understand your concern but it is just a nap.  if everything else is ok, then chill.|`|9ro8fiKvaa	Maybe it's time for her to take 1 longer nap during the day. My daughter switched from the morning and afternoon naps around the 6-7 month time. She's up in the morning at 6:30 and is exhausted by 12:30 when she enjoys a full 3+ hour long nap. She goes to bed at around 8ish at night and sleeps right through, no problem. The other kids at your daughter's daycare must take naps - maybe you could try to find out if they all go down at the same time and if so, try out their schedule. That's what I did with my daycare and now we practise the same on weekends. Good luck!

eytlIKITaa	No, I'm sorry, but you're probably not pregnant.  You just got your period 2 weeks ago...|`|rmQKOcp5aa	I don't think you are but i do know that it might be the birth control... i was taking the Depo shot and i have been off of it like 6months ago. I hated it because  every time i would get off of it i would always get the symptoms as if i was pregnant and then i would get excited and i would take a pregnancy test and it would come out negative. Just talk to your doctor and if it is the birth control try getting something that is better than what u were and if you are trying to conceive check for the days that u ovulate.. I hope that you get the results that  you want...|`|76hhm6Quaa	some of these are signs of pregnancy, but you can also get these symptoms when coming off of Birth Control, your body has to adjust.  When I came off of BC I had alot of these symptoms. The only part that confuses me is the fever, which could also be a sign of early pregnancy. Taking a HPT or going to the doctor would be the only way to find out. Good Luck|`|NNwEuC8paa	I just want to say that you can get pregnant at any time so do not listen to the first girl. I just spoke with my doctor yesterday and she informed me that I might be pregnant & i just had my period on 2.14. As for you signs. I think they sounds promising, but coming off birth control can really mess with your body for a little while.|`|hpRrlxU2aa	these are some of the typical preggo symptoms, but i wouldn't get too excited it could also be nothing. How many day past ovulation are you?
vz1gmSM7aa	Never heard of it.  But if you are going to play with fire then you should be using protection rather taking a pill and killing it because you made the mistake.
AA10624857	Whether you breast feed or not, pregnancy changes your breasts.  Even if you don't have kids, age changes your breasts, too.  It happens, nothing you can do about it.  Breast milk is the healthiest choice for babies until they are at least 12 months old.  Your husband sounds a bit on the shallow side worrying about saggy breasts instead of what's best for your baby.  I'd wait a while before considering starting a family.  I don't think he's ready for the commitment, yet.  ADDED:  The recommendation to breast feed at least a year does not mean that you don't give your baby anything else until 12 months.  It is recommended that babies exclusively breast feed for 6 months than be introduced to solids sometime after that.  Most babies don't wait until 12 months to show interest in eating solids, but usually sometime between 6-9 months a baby allowed to self-wean will begin to show interest in eating something in addition to breast milk.  Somehow people get the misconception that babies who nurse until 12 months and beyond aren't eating anything else and that is simply not true.  I am mom to 4 all breast fed as babies.  My youngest 2 never had a bottle or formula.  By 12 months they were eating table foods, drinking juice and water in a cup and breast feeding.  After 12 months we introduced whole cow's milk in their cups, too.|`|lQIKWXDuaa	6 months old is the rule in my family.     ss|`|p6AMoTs8aa	breast dont get saggy...i have a 8month old which i have been exclusively nursing and my breast are still perky. As far as how long, its all up to you, not your hubby (sorry but its true)  I say to give baby both breastfeed and formula so when you stop nursing its not a hard process. Good Luck|`|3klIx1Egaa	i formula fed from 2 weeks on, my son wouldnt latch and i couldnt do the pumping. Id recommend breast feeding as long as you can, breast fed or not your boobs are going to be saggy because milk will come in either way and they will englare.|`|m6C3pgChaa	"Choosing whether to breastfeed or formula feed your baby is one of the first decisions expectant parents will make. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) joins other organizations such as the American Medical Association (AMA), the American Dietetic Association (ADA), and the World Health Organization (WHO) in recommending breastfeeding as the best for babies. Breastfeeding helps defend against infections, prevent allergies, and protect against a number of chronic conditions.    The AAP says babies should be breastfed exclusively for the first 6 months. Beyond that, the AAP encourages breastfeeding until at least 12 months, and longer if both the mother and baby are willing."|`|OjDg4LW9aa	Doctor's generally say about a year. Then they are ready for soft foods(like baby foods) and mashed bananas and stuff like that. Try not to put him/her on formula if you can help it...breast milk is SO good for your baby!|`|6lm66aHtaa	Just so you know, my husband was leary about me breastfeeding too. Turns out he is my biggest support system and when I was in the hospital, he was even eager to help so our son could learn to latch on. He was pulling, guiding and holding my boob so his son could eat. Maybe your husband will respond the same way????  Breastfeeding is now very very important to us, and if you have husbands support....heck even if you dont....do it for as long as you can. I plan on adding formula to our routine at about 6 months.|`|0cx4imxHaa	Its a misconception that breasts sag from breastfeeding. Breasts sag from childbearing in general as well as age and gravity! The longer you breastfeed your baby, the better. Tell your husband that breast milk is specifically designed for your baby's needs while formula is made for all babies.|`|AA10207765	Well from my experience breastfeeding my son, when he was two weeks old, we all got a nasty cold. He recovered very quickly due to having my antibodies. Then at one month, we found out our city had E-COLI in the water for at least a couple of days before the city found out, and put us on a boil water advisory. Some infants got very ill from this and thankfully none died.  If he was not breastfed he would have been drinking sewer water with his formula. Breasfeeding is linked to lowering SIDS, etc. So think about what age you feel is comfortable for both of you.|`|93e5e66462cba8bcd411219422deababaa	breastfeeding doesn't cause your boobs to sag- pregnnacy and genetics do- not really the act of feeding its self. they are not his breasts so it's no his choice. the longer you nurse the less chance you have for breast cancer. he sounds like a pig if you ask me. your breasts are for your baby, not a sex toy for him to fondle     THE AAP recommends a minimum of one year- it's best to breast in itself     my fiance didn't care either way and never influenced my decision

H6QkoukSaa	Most kids gain weight rapidly from birth (you need to look at his overall growth, height and weight) then at some point (usually when they get mobile) they taper off and the weight gain evens out. If babbies keep gaining weight past 8 months like they do for the first 4-6 months they would end up like very chubby little cherubs.<br>  <br>  If his height and weight are similar on the growth chart then he is most likely fine. And no matter what a Doctor says, you can't make a child eat or drink. You can offer the extra bottle a day but he may not drink it, or it could wreck one of his other meals. From what you have written, he is eating lots and drinking well. Some kids are just smaller. Are you and your husband big and tall people? If not then you can't expect a babby to be on the 90th percentile for height and weight. Genes do strange things to kids heights and weight. My daughter is 4 and her 2yo brother is nearly the same size as she is. My babby is 20 weeks old and is nearly the same size as his 2yo brother. My daughter is in the 50th percentile for her height and weight, we have been to a dietitian (which might be a better idea for your son) who gave us lots of tips on how to handle food rejection, smaller children and food etc.<br>  <br>  Your son sounds healthy. Is he happy, sleeping well, and content most of the time? If so he is fine.|`|qdP5WAMgaa	that seems normal but if he isn't gaining weight give him some fatty foods, like the potatoes or mac and cheese|`|r3GIQgomaa	To me, I think he sounds fine. I was also told at our 9 month wellness check up that Bonham wasn't gaining enough weight but his hight was doing great. The doctor told us to give him rice cereal at least 2-3 times a day for extra iron and also to see if it would bulk him up a bit. At 9 months I think he was coming in at 17 maybe 18lbs. And he's just about to turn 11 months on the 6th and weights right at 20lbs. I think he's just small cause his father and I are small and he's extreamly active. Maybe that's the case for your little guy. Our weight issues started at our 6 month check up because bonham started crawling right before 5 months so he lost his chunk early haha|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Yea that seems pretty normal, it seems like he eats more solid food than my son (who will be 9 months old on Mar. 3rd).  My son drinks 5 -8 ounce bottles of formula a day, and then he eats about 16 ounces or so of baby food, baby oatmeal, rice cereal and stage 1 baby food.  Ur son is on table food  unlike my son but it seems like it's a good amount to me.   But it's kinda hard to tell since my son eats baby food still.<br>  How much does ur son weigh?<br>  Do u think he'd take another bottle durin the day?  Cuz u could try givin him another, maybe smaller bottle right before bed or somethin like that, or maybe try puttin an ounce or so more in each bottle and see if he'll finish the bigger bottles.  <br>  Unless of course u think u could get him to eat more solid food.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck, :D.|`|yBYQCYGuaa	Glad you're back!<br>  <br>  Poppy is also 9 months and at 21lbs is considered UNDERWEIGHT, this is because she is off the scales for height. Poppy may well eat more solids in a day than Sean does but he has a lot more formula than her. Granted, she is on disgusting prescription milk for allergies but we are lucky if she'll take 10oz of milk in a 24hour period and our dietitian told us to 'decrease' her formula in order to get her to eat more solids, thus gain weight. If he is otherwise happy and healthy and another child of yours had a similar weight growth, then I really wouldn't worry. He sounds like he is eating and drinking at regular intervals and that the amount he is eating and drinking is spot on for his weight and age.<br>  <br>  It always bugs me that they group every child into the same weight gain category, thank God they don't do that with adults!|`|mO2oOqZ3aa	Holy crap that's a lot of formula and food. I can see why your doctor is concerned, but he prob just has a fast metabolism. if this happened in your other child who is perfectly healthy then i wouldn't worry at all, but better that your doctor is proactive!!!!!|`|pXSKSS3daa	(Is this really you?? Welcome back!)<br>  <br>  That looks pretty normal to me, honestly. At that age Noah was eating less then your son, actually:<br>  <br>  8-10 AM: 7 oz. bottle<br>  11:30 AM: 6 oz. bottle<br>  2:30 PM: 5 oz. bottle and snack<br>  5:30 PM: 5 oz. bottle and finger foods<br>  7:30 PM: 5 oz. bottle<br>  <br>  Also, Noah gained ONE pound between 6 and 10 months. He weighed 20 lbs. at 6 months and 21 lbs. at 10 months. He's almost 11 months now and we think he weighs 22 lbs. It's normal for a baby's weight to taper off when they are older and more mobile.|`|SDjrojZXaa	well i have to say my son doesnt even eat 4 8 oz bottles and he is nine months so i would say he is eating pleanty....you may want to try some more pasta like the pasta pick up instead of as much beans...im assuming the chili isnt spicy though. my sons pediatrician said that the amount does taper off as they get to this age though because they are more active|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	That seems fine. If you are feeding him as much as he wants when he is hungry, his weight should be fine unless there is a medical issue like a fast metabolism, as someone mentioned already. Can I ask what he weighs? My son is also 9 months and seems to eat a good amount as well.|`|pqZAhBLvaa	With my older two, I seem to remember one more 8oz bottle every day than your baby eats, but they were big eaters. Everything else looks totally normal. Good luck!|`|r52rfBkeaa	My son was in the 20% when he was born and gradually went down the chart until his 9 mo visit where he was in the 3% and he's been there every since (he's now 16 mo).  At the 9 mo visit, when his weight gain stopped going up and just remained consistent, his doctor told me that this was normal at this age b/c they're significantly more mobile (pulling up, crawling, learning how to walk, etc.) and they burn more calories than they're taking in.<br>  <br>  My personal opinion is that your baby has a lot of formula in his diet and should probably eat more food instead, but I know that every baby is different.  If your doctor wants a food journal, that's what he's going to get, but to be realistic, every baby grows at a different rate.  You're going to have babies in the 1% and babies in the 99%.  Some days they'll eat more, some days they'll eat less.  I think the best gauge would be to wait until the 12 mo visit and see what happens.  Your baby will eat when he's hungry and will stop when he's had enough.  The only thing you can do is change what you're feeding him.
ebM6CxRQaa	Light bowels normally mean the liver might not be functioning properly.. OR he might not be digesting properly. When food is eaten and goes through the digestion process chemicals in the body make the stool brown... light color means there was a break down some where. But at the same time it could just be the way she was looking at the scan so I would not worry right now. GL and congrats on the little boy!

8Z7Nnr8zaa	if you can get to her page through the tagged photo, why don't you send her a friend request? write a message with it, just in case she's iffy about adding strangers.. say something like "saw you in __'s pix, you're too cute" or something flirty and light, and just go off what her response is ;) if she adds you, fantastic, get to know her (as much as you can off the internet anyway ;p) and if she writes back and says she doesn't add people she doesn't know, just reply with ''hmm.. well let's get to know each other then :)'' and, well, get to know her..... good luck dude, you'll never know unless you try|`|kRaVa0Wraa	do not add her or message her on facebook.   i've had guys message me on the internet like "youre cute" and i just think they are HUGE creepers. thats not attractive at all.    send a  message to the friend who uploaded the pics that she is in and be like 'hey who is your friend (insert name here), she's really cute." and see if maybe she could possibly arrange something where both of you could be there at the same time, or introduce you to  her at   a party or something.|`|RGC2aDf2aa	wow... wow...

I think let it go.... it's a best way for your situation....|`|k61MeNEKaa	if she knows who you are ...  like even a bitt it will be easier to get  connected with her.. but if she   totally does not know who you are  she is gonna think you are a total creeeeep.|`|mPrUYEDiaa	it never hurts to ask. i dont know anything about facebook, so do whatever you have to do to just say hi to her. "tag" her or whatever you call it. maybe she'll be into you too.     ya just never know until you ask. like pat benatar always said "love is a battlefield" ya gotta fight for what you want. good luck. hope she's into you!! :)|`|X1NVjZEKaa	About facebook and reality: Why would your friend be in a picture but not know the chick and you cant tag somone if there not your friend :S ahhaha

3bbe69adc879bee42549a9549a2f383aaa	I think your plans sound cute.  I love nursery ideas that are different from the norm.  I am going to have a turtle theme to my nursery. I may be pregnant, I am five days late and having symptoms but but a negative test at 4 dpo. I am testing again next week.  And I already have my entire nursery picked out.

9kPPmazoaa	When I had implantation cramping it lasted for about a week. Although I will say I experienced alot of cramping during the pregnancy as well.I honestly kept thinking my period was "still coming" because the cramping was so similiar to my period. But it never came...     I am now the proud mommy to alittle girl. She  will be 9 weeks tomorrow :)    Good Luck!!!|`|3oJL2Go3aa	Mine lasted for about a week. I would think that is what you are going through. Mine felt like I was on my period or getting ready to start. But there wasnt anything coming out. I thought I was having a hard time starting. Then when I didnt start I thought it was the stress of moving to a new state and then when I didnt start the second month then I knew something was up. I took a test and sure enough. I ran into our bedroom and jumped on the bed and showed my husband the test. I will never forget what he said when I told him to look at the test. He was like did you just pee on that? And he wouldnt touch it until I told him that I put the cap on it. Ya that was a classic husband moment. LOL.. But good luck and I wish you the best!!|`|819d5c265a3f5321ff36331588d9d9adaa	Well i started having cramping about 3 weeks after my period and it lasted for a good month or so but usually it only last for like a week or two you will have cramps your whole period though    GOOD LUCK    :)|`|pR4nLjyRaa	Usually just a few hours to a day.

fiUqIyVcaa	Nursery Water is fine but most doctors do not recommend that it be used after your baby reaches 6 months of age.  Don't freak out, you did not do anything that will hurt your baby in any way.  Most doctors recommend that you use distilled water to mix formula with.  Tap water is not safe unless your boil it.  Besides how often are you told by your water company that you are on a water advisory alert to boil your water before using it due to contamination?  The distilled water is your best bet after your child gets 6 months old.      Don't panic, your baby is fine.  You are a good mother.  You did not hurt your baby in anyway.|`|FLEXqVoiaa	I've always been told to use boiled water. Bottled water (including nursery water) sits for a long time, exposing it to bacteria.

If the mother is significantly younger, her body is not properly able to bring a baby to term and is more likely to suffer a miscarriage or premature birth. If the mother is significantly older, the risk of life threatening birth defects or Down syndrome rises drastically. Also, women who have babies earlier are less likely to develop breast cancer.  Socially, 20's are best, as a legal adult out of school is more able to devote time, money, energy, maturity and resources to caring for children than teens.|`|3klIx1Egaa	IMO 20's.. but then again everyone has diff opinions on it|`|E9F6qjRWaa	when ever you are in a stable situation and you can afford a baby!!|`|b6LcC0CEaa	Late 20s early 30s.

Im already married iv been with him for 2 and a half years, we have a nice appartment and were well off so i think its a nice age for me.|`|PkbPOWzsaa	in my opinion 30's the best age.at 30's you can say been there,done that,enjoyed life as much as i wanted,now i want to give love and care to the one and only true love=my baby(babies).and also at 30' you should be more financial stable and mature,and by financial stable i don't mean rich or owning a house but don't depend on your parent,relatives or don't live on the street.being pregnant is heaven but being a parent its much more.its a hard work and a continuous one,24h a day with no break.even if u do have a break your mind doesn't really have one.i have 2 little ones and when i do have a break and go out for a coffee with my friends,i still think once in a while;are they eating properly,are they ok,did they eat their veggies.that its just a small example.so yeah i think 30' is the best age|`|8lchebCNaa	26|`|vejHKjEDaa	Much depends upon how emotionally mature the parents are and whether, or not, they are financially secure enough to care for a family.  The optimum years for a woman to have a child are from 20 to 24 - healthier for her and the baby as, between 15-19, the risk of congenital disorders is higher than for women aged 20-24.  The chances of having a baby with Down's Syndrome, before age 20, are 1 in 1250 but that drops to 1 in 1400 by 20-24.  After age 25 this increases to 1 in 1,100 and, by the early 40's, the frequency is 1 in 100 live births. This information is from a statistical table in a 1983 copy of the Journal of the American Medical Association.   A few years ago, the Annual International Conference of Psychiatrists and Psychologists issued a news release stating the age of maturity for a woman is 25 and, for a man, age 27 - note, on first link, average age for bride and groom and, on second, average age of first-birth for mothers ...|`|UFLfNlDfaa	Whenever you are financially stable and want to take on the responsibility of a child and have love and support from others, then it could be time to have a baby... plus you have to want to have one. But being pregnant is no walk in the park, it's painful and exausting and it's a lot of hard work... not to mention being a parent! Kids are a lot of work, but it will be one of the best times of your life. Although pregnancies do happen unplanned, mine did, so you can't plan for everything, but you just take it in stride and make the best of things.|`|6ab3673bb81ad84f3158efb113c25ce3aa	20's
fUhVa18aaa	Here are some ideas :) :    -Make ginger bread men. The girls can decorate. You can say things like put on 3 buttons,use pink icing etc    - Make paper tiaras. Teachers cutting,colors and creative thinking and is very girly!    -When you grocery shopping make each girl a list with pictures of easy things to get eg. milk,cheese,bread etc. This keeps them busy while teaching about food.    -Play dress up! Every girl loves this and it teaches about jobs and different people.      -Color in! You can buy fun and cheap coloring books. This keeps them busy for ages and teachers about colors.     - Story time with a twist. Get the girls to help you make up a story a draw pics for it then read! Reading to kids is really good for their develpment.     I hope this helps :)  Try this site for more ideas http://www.supernanny.com/|`|CnM2U1bXaa	try this site   www.dltk-kids.com/|`|usb9nzJjaa	OK CUP CAKE PARTY I do this with my daughter and friends every month I buy like 3 dozen cupcakes non frosted buy cans of all color frostings all the sprinlkes and we decorate them and watch movies dance contest and back to the cupcakes we sit in a circle when we are don and pass them to the person on the right and say what we love about them.

2wyDALHgaa	People were probibly refering to doing an adoption through the foster care system.  Most people don't realize that there are no orphanages in North America any more (Canada and US).  Other countries as well but each country is different.  Some have them, some don't.      Children can be adopted through a number of means.  Private adoptions, agency facilitated adoptions and adoptions through the foster care system.  When children are removed from their parents due to abuse, neglect or a host of other reasons they end up in foster care as temporary wards of "the State".  If they can be returned eventually then they are but if it's deemed that it's not in their best interests to be returned then the Courts formally and legally severe the birth parents parental rights and the child can be placed for adoption.  Since, as I noted, there are no orphanages these children remain with foster parents until such time as they can be adopted.      Our youngest was that way.  Her birth parents had a long history of neglect, drug use, alcohol abuse, transiency and other issues that they were unwilling or unable to address with the assistance provided and when our daughter was born she was apprehended at the hospital (she was the 9th baby from these parents to be removed over the years and these parents were under 30 years of age).  She came to us technical as a foster child at 4 days old and remained with us while the legal process played out and we were able to adopt her by the time she was 6 months old.  There are children of all ages in the system and when people refer to adoptions from foster care or foster adoptions these are what they mean, not that you should just be a foster parent although there is always a need for those as well.    If you want to adopt privately or through an agency it can cost anywhere from $10,000 to $40,000 depending upon the agency, the situation and the child.  Nobody can give you a firm answer since every case is different.      If you want to adopt internationally it can be upwards of $40,000 but again, that all depends upon the country involved, the numbers of "middle men" required and any travel costs you may have as part of the process.  Again, nobody can give you a firm answer since every case was different.  (Our "international adoption" was $800 US but we were living in the country for three years and adopted while we were there.)    In most areas of the US and Canada adoptions from foster care are done at no cost to the adoptive parents or if there is a cost is minimal (under $1000).  In many areas (most?) there is even a monthly allowance that goes to the adoptive parents once the adoption through foster care is done to help offset the expenses of raising that child.  Again though, it depends upon where you are doing the adoption and your local DSS policies.|`|iVcaB9h7aa	The majority of domestic newborn adoptions cost less than $25,000, while more than 75 percent of international adoptions cost more than $20,000.   The majority of adoptions from Korea cost between $20,000 and $30,000.   The majority of adoptions from Ethiopia and China cost between $15,000 and $25,000.   The majority of adoptions from Russian and Guatemala cost more than $30,000.   38 percent of domestic adopters had at least one "false start," in which adoptive parents worked with one or more birthmothers before a match that succeeded.   The majority of "false starts" cost less than $5,000.|`|ETcBRko3aa	If you "actually want to make a difference in a child's life" as YOU wrote, then ADOPT through the foster care system......    There are over 200,000 children in the foster care system WHO NEED TO BE ADOPTED and need a family.  They are "legally free" to be adopted......all ages, all race, and both genders.    ....if you really want to help a child.|`|JP04HX6maa	"I think it's heartless and rude that people have such a big deal with questions about adoption."    Really?    I think they should be having a big deal about adoption. It is not a fairytale. It is not "pay the fees, get the child, happily-ever-after."    Adoption is complex. To finally understand that it IS complex takes guts and a hell of a lot of self-reflection.    I used to have a simplistic view of adoption. Then I started blogging, and realized it is nothing BUT complex. You are currently asking questions about why "we" view it as complex and why we are questioning it - that is a VERY GOOD START.    "Why is that a practice?"    Because it is - it is profit based off of the separation of mother and child.    Mothers and their biological offspring aren't MEANT to be separated. Some need to be taken out of their parents' care for a little while because their parents may be neglecting or abusing them, or even end up in foster care. But as a society, we should NOT be promoting the separation of mother & child.    Adoption is like the magical Band-Aid. It supposedly fixes everything.     No. It does not.    Children are not abandoned because they are unwanted. They are oftentimes abandoned because their parents lack the resources to fight for them. Adoption takes advantage of that. And many people cannot understand that or refuse to face that.|`|BU3A3rR4aa	im 28 weeks pregnant and i dont want to give my baby for adoption but i also can't provide for her and i would never want her to have a bad life i want her to be happy with parents that can care for her and love her as if it would be their own daughter !   are you going through an agency?|`|q4EXFhV7aa	They were probably referring to the Foster Care adoption program.   There is 'fostering' and there is 'adoption through foster care'. I am a foster-to-adopt mommy, but you don't have to do any fostering if you choose not to do so.  Adoption through foster care is free. There are children of all races, ages, and sex. You can choose what type/age/sex/race child would best fit into your family. At the most, you will have to pay for legal fees to adopt, which run from 800-1800 bucks. Many states cover those fees as well. You can contact Child Protective Services or DSS to learn more about adoption.

WxQFe0GYaa	Usually it's between 20 and 30.  In my area (NJ), they pay $8,000.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I just looked for my state and you have to be between 21 and 29, 5' 2" or taller, have a BMI under 25, be attractive, have a special talent like music, athletics, etc.<br>  And  the list goes on!!|`|G4qP2gATaa	Where I live you have to be between 20 and 30, and upon donation they pay you $4,000, and when your egg is used you  might receive more money. You also have to be in shape.<br>  <br>  Like everyone else said, the process is a long one.<br>  <br>  Just look online to see for your area.|`|OIS808Qmaa	Usually over 24, and the amount depends on the person.  Those are just the beginning guidelines - you will need to go through rigorous medical testing to see if you're qualified.  If you are, you will have to give yourself shots every day to encourage egg production so that when they collect your eggs, there are more than just one.  Please make sure that you are comfortable knowing that your child is out there being raised by someone else.  I know it doesn't seem that way, but I have a close friend who gave this gift to someone, and she has had many sleepless nights wondering if their child has her eyes or her laugh.  In no way am I trying to discourage you, I think it's an extraordinary gift to give someone, but you need to make sure you are 100% before you go through with it.  Good luck  :-)|`|mldo1vxYaa	21, its not an easy thing to do, first of all its not a morning appt to donate them and then its all over, it takes almost a month for the whole process and you are restricted what you can do during that time.

vue9NOhYaa	No birth control method is perfect.<br>  <br>  The Mirena is VERY effective, but not quite 100%. So yes, you can be pregnant. However, if the test is negative, you almost certainly are not pregnant. The hormones in the Mirena may be giving you pregnancy like symptoms, or it could be something unrelated.  <br>  <br>  See your doctor.|`|r52rfBkeaa	Yes, you can become pregnant while using Mirena.  Negative tests can be false.  If you've missed your period and still testing negative, contact your doctor.  There can be serious complications if you become pregnant with an IUD and you need to be careful.|`|vz1gmSM7aa	You can but not very likely.  I had the Mirena in for 4 years and didn't pregnant.  I hated that thing so I had it taken out early.<br>  <br>  Mirena can make your period go away completely so just because you kept getting a neg. test and no period doesn't always mean you are preggo.  My doc told me only if I'm really feeling like I'm pregnant and have the signs then I would need to see the doc.  Plus the Mirena does not effect a pregnancy test either.

He too had to spend two weeks in the NICU so I know exactly how you feel.  It's not fun.  He was on a little bit of oxygen because he got some fluid in his lungs during delivery, he was on antibiotice through an IV for that and he got jaundice really, really, bad.  <br>  <br>  The time in the NICU seems like it lasts forever, but in the grand scheme of thing, my two weeks was short, looking back now.  <br>  <br>  Congrats on your baby and I am glad she is doing well.|`|a298446e0bf2f2f5cefd59de3c347549aa	Congrats! I had a baby girl at 33 weeks. She weighed 5lbs, but like your little one she wouldn't take a bottle so we went through the tube feedings for almost two weeks, while trying the bottle. She finally took bottles and was discharged after spending almost 3 weeks in the NICU! Scarey, but the nurses were wonderful. I'll pray that your little one makes it home soon, healthy and happy!|`|mVD3TQkFaa	I'm glad that she is doing good!

b978f631fc787a963337206aa3833370aa	I think your doctor sounds like a gem and I would want to deliver all my babies with her! Honestly, you are lucky - most doctors would freak out and then do an automatic c-section. It sounds like your doctor is very level headed and reacted well and everything went fine. Congrats - and I wish all doctors were like yours!<br>  <br>  ETA: Sure, some babies are in danger - but we really have no way of truly assessing it. If the doctor reacted the way she did, she did so for a reason - to some of the thumbs down people, not every birth is an emergency. Nor do doctors have to treat women with kid gloves and make them think they can't do anything, including birth a baby. Cheated death? WTH kind of thing is that to say? This woman's baby is fine, nothing else matters.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Its very common, and some times the cords around more than once. Its really scary too. <br>  i'm glad your baby is fine|`|qStmw7qgaa	I went through that exact same thing.  My dr. had me stop pushing too because if I hadn't, my baby girl would have been strangled.  But my dr. is a lot like yours and she made it seem like no big deal.  She just said "ok hun, stop pushing for a sec...ok great, now one more push and you're done."  My husband told me later why she said to stop pushing.|`|AA10063059	very common,but this is when it is important to have help during labour as some women reckon they can do it on their own|`|Xc02z608aa	My baby came breach (bum first!) with the cord around his neck.  It's actually quite common and your baby was in no danger.<br>  <br>  Congrats on your baby!|`|a298446e0bf2f2f5cefd59de3c347549aa	Just take a deep breath and relax. That is dangerous but not uncommon. It happens when the baby moves around to get into postion to be delivered. Thats why the doctor had you stop pushing so they could remove the cord safley so it wouldn't cut off the oxygen supply. Some babies have it wrapped around 2 or three times. I have seen knots in the cord. It's weird how it happens but most to all babies are born fine and healthy. The heart rate was monitored to make sure the oxygen level was back to normal. Congrats on the baby. Relax, it something was wrong the doctors would not hesitate to let you know.|`|txv7TIgiaa	i have heard of this alot sometimes i think the doctors don't tell you everthing cuz they don't want you to freak out...yeah the baby was possibly in danger because they can loose oxigen to the brain when the cord is wraped around the neck...|`|qdP5WAMgaa	no that was a big deal, but it sounds that everything is ok.  they prob didn't say anything so you wouldn't freak out.|`|My93XR2Maa	my bby da'ion cord was wrapped around his neck 2 times n my went just like yours but i think it a common thing.

Initially, my Pediatricians nurse just called me and told me that I am absolutely not to give him anything other than infant tylenol, and I should use a humidifier and/or saline nasal spray for congestion, but I ended up taking him in, and the doctor increased his tylenol dosage, and had me alternate the infant tylenol with infant motin, one or the other every 3 hours.  It seems to be helping.<br>  <br>  I also use aromatherapy rubs for his chest congestion both california baby and little colds have baby chest rubs that don't have the dangerous stuff that Vicks has. <br>  <br>   Also I prop up one side of his crib so that his head is elevated when he sleeps.|`|dDVAUA9saa	Children's advil.

fe6fcbf713d0ed0538de9c9304001a52aa	<a href="http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2007/10/safety-commission-says-no-toy-safety" rel="nofollow">http://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2007/10/...</a><br>  Yesterday, after the summer's spate of high-profile toy recalls, the Senate Commerce committee passed the most significant legislation affecting CPSC since the agency was created more than thirty years ago. Sponsored by Senator Mark Pryor (D-Arkansas), the bill increases CPSC's budget from $63 million to $142.7 million by 2015, and raises the cap on civil penalties the agency can levy against companies that hide product defects, from $1.8 million to $100 million. The bill gives CPSC a couple of new responsibilities—the agency will credential independent third-party testing labs whose job it will be to safety-test toys, and it will have the authority to investigate and respond to safety-related whistleblower complaints made by company employees.<br>  <br>  Acting CPSC chairman Nancy Nord opposes the bill. Voicing her objections in a five-page letter to the committee, Nord argued that CPSC would be overwhelmed by its new responsibilities, and that many of the bill's provisions would do little more than increase litigation. Nord doesn't think CPSC should be in charge of credentialing testing labs, she wants nothing to do with whistleblower complaints, and, using a bizarre logic that apparently makes sense to her (and to industry), concludes that increasing the civil penalty cap to $100 million will make it more likely that truly dangerous products will not reach CPSC's radar screen. Overall, Nord said, the bill would have the "unintended consequence of hampering, rather than furthering consumer product safety."<br>  <br>  Most of Nord's complaints are identical to those voiced by industry trade groups, chief among them, the National Association of Manufacturers, whose chief lobbyist, Michael Baroody, President Bush had nominated to fill Nord's job a year earlier. (Baroody withdrew his nomination before this Senate confirmation hearings). House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-California) has called on Nord to resign. That the agency needs more resources and authority is clear, Pelosi said; the problem is that Nord simply does not understand "the gravity of the situation." <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007/11/youre-not-regulator-me-how-bush-administration-made-america-safe-dangerous-toysthe" rel="nofollow">http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2007...</a> cpsc was created in 1972 with a broad range of powers. It could impose mandatory safety standards, ban or recall products found to be unsafe and dangerous, and levy fines on companies that hid safety information. Its job was to keep tabs on more than 15,000 types of consumer goods—just about everything you'd find in a Wal-Mart except food and drugs. By 1979, it had a budget of $44 million and a staff of nearly 900, whose investigations resulted in 545 recalls that year alone.<br>  <br>  Then came the Reagan administration. Within months of taking office, Reagan convinced Congress to pass legislation that crippled the commission: Before it could impose mandatory standards on any product, it had to wait for industry to write its own standards, and then prove that they had failed. Recalls plummeted to fewer than 200 a year, and by 1988 the commission's budget was down 22 percent and its staff had been cut almost in half.<br>  <br>  But it was under Hal Stratton, George W. Bush's commission chairman (and former New Mexico attorney general, as well as Lawyers for Bush cochair), that the commission turned from paper tiger to industry lapdog. Stratton cut back on investigations while taking full advantage of the perks of his office—he turned the agency into "a little travel bureau," according to a longtime staffer. When a coalition of doctors and safety advocates asked him to look into the problem of adult-sized all-terrain vehicles marketed to kids, Stratton said he'd do a study. Three years (and more than 400 atv-related deaths of kids under 16) later, he released the results of fact-finding trips to West Virginia, New Mexico, and Alaska, where he'd met with safety advocates as well as various atv enthusiast groups. The upshot: a proposal to let kids ride even bigger, more powerful atvs.<br>  <br>  Stratton's departure in 2006 left the agency with a grim record—product-related deaths were up from 22,000 in 1998 to 27,000—and only two commissioners, one from each side of the aisle. Lacking a quorum, much of the commission's work came to a halt. After waiting more than seven months to pick a new chairman, President Bush nominated a senior lobbyist for the very industry the commission regulates: Michael Baroody, of the National Association of Manufacturers. In May, Bush withdrew the nomination after it was disclosed that the association planned to give Baroody a $150,000 severance package when he took his new job. That left the cpsc's Republican commissioner, Nancy Nord—the former director of consumer affairs at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce—in place as acting chairman; she had earlier shown her bona fides by turning down Senate Democrats who wanted to increase the commission's budget.

yNV2kRlbaa	I love these names!!<br>  <br>  I really like Soleil, it's so pretty!<br>  <br>  One name I really like (of mayan origin) is Xochitl, pronounced Soshi<br>  <br>  It means flowered or beautiful<br>  <br>  And Adelaide (isn't a very common name) but I think it's really pretty...|`|94a46d94405353b1f3f1de9ec8eeca2aaa	Unusual or interesting names are ok - but your choice may impact the child's success later on in life. (Did you know that dozens of serial killers have the middle name Wayne?)|`|1WygSLkUaa	yes i lkie ususal name my son is called kiolin its pronunced KE O LIN it is name after a type or rock spelt kaolyn but i spelt it diffrently on his birth certificate lol. so its kiolin now..|`|hl7Tqxjgaa	Soleil|`|HiT7OM9Maa	i like soleil<br>  i swear dats french for sunny?????|`|txv7TIgiaa	i like soleil|`|DHwPgw9iaa	Pet names, yes. In fact, ironically enough, I used to have a Pomeranian puppy named Bijou! :]<br>  <br>  I've also had dogs named Blitzen, Jayda, and Bella. [The other 9 dogs I've had have relatively normal "dog" names.]<br>  <br>  In terms of baby names, I'm not a fan of weird ones. Classic, easy to pronounce ones work perfectly for me.|`|tjGFRs1Kaa	Yes, I like unusual names, because they're different and unique.|`|AA11946005	I'm more a fan of familiar yet not overly common names.  I think unique or unusual names are more of a burden (having to correct spellings or pronunciation, or even assumptions re gender),<br>  Nova, Kai and Bijoux are gender neutral to me, and I can't say I'm crazy about them,  Soleil is definately female, but a bit too "hippy dippy" for my tastes.|`|T1qzML1Zaa	As long as they are not too weird I like them. I also like names that are considered boy names for girls like Ryan. (I know a lot of people hate that but I like it and don't see a problem with it) Out of your names I like Nova and Kai. I heard  the name Novalee one time and really liked it but Nova is fine even by itself.|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I like names that are not in the top ten but not unheard of, I really like the names, Lillian, Taylor, Tatum, Alaina, Bailey, Tristan, Riley, Sebastian, Austin, & Conley, so whatever type of names those are, is the type of names I like.|`|XQiH90x2aa	i dont think you came up with those names ... i heard them all before|`|w0eRRsoVaa	I like unusual names...to a certain point.  There is a line people have a tendency to cross when they want something uncommon or unusual that pertains the babies.  <br>  <br>  Kai isn't unusual.  Nova reminds me of a Chevy Nova but I can live with it.  Bijoux, unless you live in the French community, I don't recommend it.  Soleil doesn't bother me becaus I think of Soleil Moon Frye who played Punky Brewster.<br>  <br>  The names I've chosen are uncommon but not unheard of and exist with good meaning to them.|`|oEM2YL6Laa	Personally I prefer classic names, however that is my own opinion and I wouldn't inflict this or indeed be against anybody else naming their child unusually. Personally I prefer Kai- but then that is because it is uncommon but not enough so to raise eyebrows. I am of course only speaking for myself.|`|s2F6pK9Xaa	For me it depends on the name. I LOVE Soleil, I like Kai, Bijoux is a bit too "out there" for me though. And Nova, though kinda pretty, still makes me think of the crappy Chevy from long ago.|`|56365ccf12a9d3741995e9c3c1032fdbaa	Yea, unusual names are really awesome. XD<br>  <br>  I really like Kai out of the names you picked. 8D  Japanese names just catch my eye.|`|47M20WOUaa	I love unusual names :)|`|WNn8WDPHaa	i think that they are beautiful names.. the more uniue..they better|`|ValLVBcYaa	I love unusual names except when they are WAY unusual and the kid will just get laughed at. <br>  <br>  I would name my kid Kai. =)|`|KyLPuSoQaa	i think it shows that the parents arent like sheep and are willing to do something new
fYMWDQLGaa	i would suggest you to take a blood test in free or walkin clinic. HPT are reliable though.|`|gPg7qYGIaa	i have the kinda same problem test say negative but i still don't have my prides i went to gp and she said to Wait a few more weeks and test again but my and is still say no Wait another 2 test again if not go back they will do blood test|`|bKK2fPiVaa	After years of a regular cycle, 2009 dawned and changed all of that!  In January I was 7 days late and took two HPT's which came back negative.  In February I was 10 days late and same thing... two negative HPT's.  My doctor told me that a woman's cycle just DOES that sometimes.  I don't know if I buy into that or not... but it's the only hope I have at the moment!<br>  Good luck to your friend.  Stress, weight changes and a multitude of other things can be the reason for the delayed period and negative test.|`|C5uY7lIWaa	My cousin and I are both TTC.  Our periods were both 11 days late this last month.  Not sure why but it was frustrating!  I would have your friend test again in a few days if her period hasn't started and then call the doctor to get in.  Sometimes people skip periods too for no known reason.|`|UMwrgxoYaa	My cycle is usually very regular, last month when no period showed up I took 3 tests over the next few days, all negative! My period showed up exactly 2 weeks late and I can't think of one reason why it should of.|`|8os6wuQLaa	test again|`|1dNBZFPbaa	Weight gain or loss could also affect your period..
Bw1h5xAcaa	You should see a perinatologist, and if your blood pressure can be controlled with medications then honestly there is no reason that you couldn't have a normal pregnancy. Many women have chronic hypertension and can manage it with meds during pregnancy just fine. But you need to follow your doctor's instructions explicitly! <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	did you take any medication during your other pregnancies?  i am currently taking a medication safe for pregnant women that controls blood pressure.  there are not alot of medication options but there are some.  if they have not already tried that with you i would ask. The one i am taking is called Aldomet i beleive.  It has been working very well.|`|znkumaA1aa	Try the Brewer's Diet and herbs to help maintain normal blood pressure. I also suggest swimming regularly and not working.
ybexjS2Paa	Exactly the same problem I have. My little one is 14 months and for the past week or so she's been waking up about 3-4 am miserable, crying and not wanting to go back to sleep. Then it's very hard to get her down for naps during the day. I though maybe she's teething and feeling a bit down. Maybe it's just a phase they go through.|`|mPhsJ6Fjaa	my son is 14 months old. he usually goes to sleep around 8 and wakes up around 8 in the morning. the past two nights he went to sleep and woke up at 2 and wouldnt go back to sleep till630 in the morning. a guess its just a phase they are going thru. hopefully it will pass soon. good luck and rest when you can|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	My daughter was 4 weeks when she started sleeping through the night I honestly thought at that time that all these people who said their kids didn't sleep through the night were crazy or just not "doin it right" well paybacks a b*@ch because my now 10 month old son hasn't slept through the night for 10 months we just recently hit a 3 day streak where he slept all night but then we had him up at 3 am last night. My doc says if they are getting sick or getting a tooth and if they are learning a new skill they can wake up in the night... Good luck I feel your pain!|`|kY8JTDD6aa	It's really hit and miss with babies, because every one is different.  I do however remember my oldest doing this and we kept him up from his naps for a couple days.  <br>  <br>  Is she teething?  If she is you could try Tylenol.  <br>  <br>  Or the age old no no, which I remember using once.  I really needed some sleep (please don't do this more than once a month).  A dropper full of wine will help her sleep.|`|AA12227599	My daughters are 5 and 6 and I haven't gotten a full night sleep since the first one was born. They wake up every single night at least once or twice. I even tried getting them new mattresses, but nothing works. I honestly don't think there is any way to cure it, or I'd be a much happier girl. <br>  Good luck.|`|ntLqwEDnaa	Yh Im like 13 years old and my baby who is two, Just downt like to sleep on time.|`|OfolWiJsaa	my 14 mth old son never slept through the entire night. but he does sleep in his own bed now. he still wakes up twice but he wakes up really to just to make sure we are alright. once he hears me say its alright he goes back to sleep. he wakes up around ten am and naps at noon til maybe four or five sometimes six and turns in for the night around ten and he sleeps pretty good for about three hour, four if hes worn out, and when he wakes up it for only maybe a minute or two before hes back asleep. sometimes kids wake up because they have gas or just want to make sure you are okay and once they feel secure they go back to sleep. i do sometimes put my son in the bed with us, not often, but sometimes just so he will feel a sence of security.|`|AA10035322	She is problem not needing as much sleep as she is getting older. She probably needs to stay up later. My daughter used to get up threw the night so i started letting her stay up later and it worked.
vJEatJFPaa	I mix Olivia's bottles right before each feedings so they are fresh. You can also mix them and store them in the refrigerator too.

Boys; Ethan and Aiden are nice but maybe with a longer middle name|`|ddc9e2f14c0715db1f923457f6f89281aa	Some of the names don't really fit together.

But my favorites are Aeryn Sage, Bella Hope, and Sofia Elle (girls)  and Gavin Joel and Jason Cole (boys)
3I3Thz6waa	Oh goodness....how horrible. I think the first thing you should do is call your doctor right away and go in to get tested  for anything the dog could have given you. We can sort of assume that since it's a neighbors dog, it has taken rabies shots and such, but it's always better to be safe than  sorry, so please go get checked.  Also the doctor should take a look at the wound and make sure you don't get an infection. You never know how these things can affect a growing fetus. <br>  <br>  You should also make sure you talk to your neighbor and tell them what happened. Once a dog bites, you have the right to complain and file a case against the dog, it's up to you what you want to do but remember that you have EVERY right to complain since the dog did bite you and he could be a danger to not just other adults but small children. I mean, he was able to bite you and it hurt, and you're an adult, imagine if he had attacked a child....not good...<br>  <br>  So my advice would be to think calmly about what you want to do about the dog, and definitely go to the doctor to check the wound and check on your baby. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|add1238669d46216eb94b39fb19e0553aa	you need to report the dog to the police, so they can check on the dogs shot records and have something on file, this could be the first time the dog has bitten someone or it could be the fifth time you dont know. second clean the would with an antibactiral soap and put an antibiotic ointment on it and cover it with a bandage. do not use peroxide, peroxide bubbles and the bubbles will cause and bacteria from the dogs mouth to circulate back into the open wound. next call your dr and see if you need a tetnus shot.|`|v3LnJycKaa	report it to your neighbor, ask to see his papers showing that he hashad his shots get the vet name and call for verification and aks if there is anything you should do specifically, also cal your dr and just report it... why did the dog bite you?|`|kvYgopThaa	first off you should report the bite to the humain society, because if your neighbors dog bite's and is not in a fence or inside the house that's bad becuase it can bite other people. You should also go get it checked out, becuase dogs can cary a lot of diseases that you nor the baby need. if there was blood then it broke the skin and you are exposed to any disease the dog may or may not have.|`|57IDs4byaa	Im not a doctor but I would think that if you wiped it with alcohol you should be alright. You should get some peroxide and neosporin to put on it as well. <br>  <br>  The dog wasnt Rabit was it?|`|ZxCLrB1Taa	go to your doctor or call him right away
6Nv8unWraa	Actually, that IS postpartum depression.  You really need to talk with a professional.|`|faPKwClPaa	If you even have a question about this, PLEASE make an appointment with your ob/gyn or doctor and talk to them about this.<br>  <br>  You may just be sad, but it may be PPD and you do not want to mess around with that.  It doesn't go away on its own, either, so please get any necessary help you may need.|`|PLgNsOF9aa	I totally understand. You are acting very normal. You need to get out of the house and do something. Go visit people of the morning or something like that. What you are feeling is fine, you are lonely and sad...tis okay. You are doing great and you will feel more uplifted come spring! :-)|`|wqRSMSlLaa	Isolation and feeling like you don't have enough support can cause depression.  I suggest you speak with a therapist who specializes in postpartum depression.  She should be able to put together a plan of action for you including nutrition, sleep, emotional support and physical support to help you feel like yourself again.<br>  <br>  Dr. Shoshana Bennett|`|276aa285c0c3bcae2ed83a2a0b8cfa53aa	having a baby is a big thing and a little overwhelming sometimes. i too remember wanting my husband to stay with me. like i couldnt cope on my own (although i knew i could) i felt like i wanted that bit of support. when he was in work i felt alone and the burder and responsibility was huge. i suggest you get yourself to a mother and toddler group, get some support behind you. do you have either parents local? it is possible it is post natal depression, if you want medication to help, visit the Dr in the meantime have confidence in yourself. you have made 43 days and as your body, hormones and baby settle, so will the crying. good luck.|`|b8f0CfSsaa	It does sound like PPD to me. Your best bet is to tell your husband how you are feeling, it is important that he knows as you will need emotional support if you do have PPD.<br>  <br>  If you are lonely you should get your mum, sister, aunty, friend to come round every so often and spend time with you. Explain how you are feeling and that you think it is PPD and maybe get them to help you around the house a little...some women find it very surprising how a little help around the house will lift their spirits.<br>  <br>  Try and visit some mother and baby groups to see if that lifts your spirits, being stuck in the house with a baby can leave you clinging to your husband for dear life!<br>  <br>  Try and seek counselling, this sounds far more like PPD than loneliness and remember it is nothing to be ashamed of!|`|kY8JTDD6aa	I go through this after every baby. (I've had five)  I think it's depression, but I've found getting out and connecting with other moms via playgroups and community activities that keep me from being lonely help a great deal.  Try to keep busy and find something you like doing.  Good luck.  God bless!|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	I think what you are going through is normal.  I went through the same exact thing.  Every time my husband would leave I would ball like a little baby.  I hated being a lone, not to mention taking care of a little baby by yourself I was scared I wouldn't know what to do or I would do something wrong.  I did the same thing with my mom, I hated when my mom wasn't with me.  It is a phase I think you will get over it as time goes on and you get more used to your new life style.  If you haven't had your 6 week pp visit I would talk to your Dr while you are there and see what they suggest.  Mine said I was just going through the hormones and a huge life change. <br>  <br>  If you feel like you need someone to talk to you can email or IM me, I am on here a few times through out the day.
Bw1h5xAcaa	If you were miscarrying, you wouldn't have seen anything "wormlike", as the embryos at 4 weeks are only a little larger than the size of the period at the end of this sentence. <br>  <br>  Spotting in early pregnancy is relatively normal, cramps can be too. Obviously you'll want to see your doctor as we can't diagnose a miscarriage for you, but it doesn't sound like a miscarriage to me based on your description.|`|wl7tlYOYaa	It is possible to miscarry one twin and continue a pregnancy I know people who went through that. It doesnt sound like a miscarriage because you  barely had any blood just spotting. Just go and check thats all we can tell you.|`|txv7TIgiaa	well i think that it is possible you misscarried, but i had alot of bleeding when i was 7 week pregnant but my baby was fine...|`|SXRa4p8Vaa	it happened to me twice and never bother to see my doctor i think its miscarried thou.|`|WNn8WDPHaa	go to an ER..it sounds like a possibilty..but you have to get to a hospittal..ASAP!
