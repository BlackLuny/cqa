LGkb4xibaa	dancing, drama or music are notoriously hard to get into on a professional level. That doesnt mean you shouldnt follow your dream.    Theatre train are very unlikely to lie to you. If they give you feedback it will be truthful, because they wouldnt want to deliberately give someone false hope. Most people you audition for in your life will give you an honest summary of what you've done. Either voluntarily or if you ask them.    Confidence is a big thing with any performance areas obviously. The best way to get over stage fright is to do as much stage work as you can, and get used to the feeling of people looking at you. Try joining amateur dramatic groups or a local dance club. This will allow you to gain crucial experience and get genuine feedback from people, without having to pay stage / dance school prices.    Before you go on stage concentrate on your breathing. Breathe deep and even and this will calm you down. As will knowing your performance piece off by heart... Nothings worse than worrying about that last few steps you didnt master in time just before you step out in front of your audience.    When you practice at home, try and imagine how your audience would see you if you had one. If you feel they would see certain moves as not very good, get rid of them or modify them. The more experience you get from performing, the adept you'll become at knowing what an audience will like.    Also, i dont know what particular type of dance your into, but try and find choreographed pieces of work that are in your style. Then you can study and try to copy them. Also, watch other dancers in the genre and see how they interpret things.     You should definately dance with your friend. Dont worry about messing up. I'm sure you'll be fine. And even the most famous dancers make mistakes sometimes. Its life!    As for your mum... Any chance of drawing up a bargain with her? Maybe you could do a part time english course or study from home? Or maybe you could agree that if, in a few years your dream career has not been what you'd hoped, you'll study it then.|`|4scMHGGvaa	Dont worry about what other people will think. There are many girls who are like that and who wont dance because of that. Please dont let that stop you. Walk into the class and be like i am on top i can dance and i know it. Noone is going to bring me down and i wont stop. Ask the teacher for help if you need it. Dont be afraid of trying something new just go into it like its nothing even if you are a little scared.|`|G77DHjRKaa	go for it . like you say you do it at home so that's practice . and you should video your self then look back on it and see what you think your doing wrong . not like you are or anything im sure your good . but just don't drop out . i felt the same when i started rugby . i stuck to it . trained and i get better . so be the best hunny|`|7ZJ2g6TXaa	Hey,  Now I know at first things might seem a little embarrassing but the key is to keep practicing and really put your self out there. It was a good move sending that video in, because even if they send you a not so good report it's something you can learn from you know? I have been a dancer for 15 years and I got good but I wasn't always, but I practiced and I went to competitions. Take every thing that anyone tells you as advice. And learn from it. If you really want to be a dancer than that's all that matters. Clubs aren't really a good place to learn or even to practice because its not the same. I hope that this helped you a little bit.    Remember just keep practicing and be positive! :)|`|MR9Ax1WZaa	My advice would be to apply for a HND in performance and acting at college to get you started..   It has a dance module so you can get the relevant training. It is good because you will have people in your course who can't dance and prefer acting or singing so you can try it without the pressure of having lots of good dancers round you intimidating you ;) This is the time of year to apply for courses starting in August / September.. I started studying my HND in acting and performance 4 years ago and now Im in my last degree year and I love it..   Hope I've helped  Good luck babe xx    ps, the audition process is not difficult and you will be great, just pracise and have more faith in yourself.. dont let people tell you your no good anyway :)|`|MEuqT0Rvaa	Its better to just believe in yourself than worry am i goood enough. if you spend your whole life worrying wat other people think youll never gt any where i love to act and at first i lacked self confidence too. but then i just thought you no wat i probably look worse if i dont have confidence in what i am doinand just believe it. who cares if you mess up just laugh along and i am sure everyone will forget it in a hour and something else will happen. so i say just go for it and DANCE . x
aSwSyjuNaa	From 'Behind the Name':     BEOWULF  Gender: Masculine  Usage: Anglo-Saxon Mythology  Pronounced: BAY-?-woolf (English)    Possibly means "bee wolf" (in effect equal to "bear") from Old English beo "bee" and wulf "wolf". This is the name of the main character in the anonymous 8th-century epic poem 'Beowulf'. The poem tells how Beowulf slays the monster Grendel and its mother, but goes on to tell how he is killed in his old age fighting a dragon.|`|dyeIsOLpaa	Beowulf in Old English means Bee-Wolf.

LVZdzPmpaa	I'm not sure what play you refer to. Miguel De Cervantes wrote "Don Quixote" and is names in the credits for the play and the film as well, given that both are based on his novel. There are different spin-offs based on the story, and perhaps de Cervantes has a role in one of those. But in the classic version, there is no such part.

Thankfully we've come a long way since their enactment.    The term itself is subject to speculation, however.  There are stories that it may refer to a blackface slave character named Jim Crow, played by Thomas D. Rice.  It may be a reference to the song "Jump Jim Crow."  Some sources indicate that it may predate both the character and the song -- we don't know for sure when the term surfaced.|`|AA11981114	the term "Jim Crow" originates from the blackface vaudeville song "Jump Jim Crow," which depicts a crippled black man used as the butt of a joke.

Maybe twist it a bit?     For titles, just a pointer, a lot of people might be attracted toward one-word titles, but another half are certainly not. "Forever" seems too clich. Try something more unique.     Trapped Between Two,  Till death brings you back (a bit long),  Ghost boy,  etc.     By the way, sorry to say this, but your main character (the girl) sort of sounds like a Mary Sue to me.

Also, it's for fun unless you hope to publish it someday then there is some worrying to do. Just have fun and don't worry if you keep changing the story.

GqrRBZ3faa	I have the same problem. Pacing is a terrible thing with me.  Well, for my whole novel I made an outline. This way I know what I want to say in each chapter. But if you are doing it chapter by chapter and just with an idea in your head, I would make a check list for each chapter. Have you said everything for the reader to have a good idea of your character? Did you state their name, age, situation, etc? Is there a basic plot brewing that the reader wants to know more of? Try to look at your writing as the reader. Anything missing? Anything you wish you knew about the character or situation so far that the writer hasn't said yet?       That's if you *want* to get the basics out of the way in the first chapter. Another approach could be to leave some mystery. How I did mine was describing a scene and having my character kind of walk into her everyday life with the reader. If you want to read it to understand what I mean, here is a link to it.   http://www.fictionpress.com/s/2607982/1/...    Sorry, it's difficult to explain. I mean that the first chapter can just be describing a place or the home of the character or something that you, as a reader, don't really think has to do with the story, but it ends up being a big part of it.|`|AA12095483	You don't.

Instead, go into background details, let the readers learn more about the characters and how the characters interact with each other.|`|AA12071655	A writer "pads" his/her writing if being paid by the word, or it's for a class assignment.

No, I'm not being funny. Think about it.|`|ahjqc9Ifaa	I think you're probably making a mistake lots of beginners make. You've started with background instead of with something happening.    If you jump in with an event rather than introducing people and having them prepare, it's most certainly going to be more readable. Then as the event unfolds, you sneak in bits of background until the reader gets just as much introduction as in your first version, only in a far more interesting way.

No real sense thinking about publishing when you haven't grasped the basic fundamentals of starting to write.|`|SMrSII2eaa	First things first- expect a lot from your self.  Later find a  good topic/that'll attract whoever you are aiming for.  It could be a real life situation or a dream that you had that you fell in love with and didn't want to forget so soon. Start somewhere in your story that you are able to. (i.e. if you have a dream about a man who dies but comes back to life), jump in right there and then you can work before/after/middle in that. Just get your basic idea down first. Make time to write every single day. Some day's you'll have to force yourself to and only get a few sentences down. Other days you can get atleast a chapter down. Start writing in a notebook where it's easy to find your ideas and easy to change your story. Later work on typing it in WORD. Save it onto a jumpdrive or a hardrive just incase your computer were to crash and you lost everything. That takes me back to my first point- write in a notebook, too. Once you have your story typed/written get someone whom you really trust to give you constructive critism. Read back through it and tie up any loose ends. Now here's the fun part :) Name your book if you haven't already done so. Be silly and think of a cover you think will draw people into reading it. Take it to several publishers and see what they have to say.Either they'll as for more or they will send you packing. It's a dog for a dog world, the writing business. Good luck.   Some tips:  -Keep two notebooks to write character names in and plots and then one for your actual story.  -NEVER post ANY of your ideas on the internet. They'll be in some one else's hands in a heart beat.   -While your writing, don't think about the fame and glory you may get from your book. You will never get it done.  -If your first book doesn't get published, it's okay to be upset for a little while but don't put writing on the back burner. Continue with your story to make it better or start with a new writing project.  -It's going to be stressful but just hang im there.  -Most importantly just have fun writing. Let your brain wonder... turn on your active imagination.    Hope I help you, and hope you have a blessed writing career.  Madison H.

Part if it was just the nature of German bureaucrats and partly it was because of the impression that the managers of the holocaust wanted to report to Hitler the progress being made on the "Final Solution to the Jewish Problem."    It is true that as the Allies advanced into German Territory the Nazis tried to destroy many of these records, but the evidence of the deaths could not all be hidden.  Between mass graves, the tremendous piles of confiscated personal belongings, missing person's reports and other forensic evidence, a faily accurate number of deaths could be extrapolated.    It's not like the Nazis could "get off on a technicality" simply because the EXACT number could not be pinpointed.

Both go out and collect all the data they can find and try to construct a convincing argument.       Anyway, in respect to your particular question I can only recommend this link to you:    http://www.nizkor.org/features/qar/qar01...      It is actually intended as an argument against modern Holocaust deniers, but that is also why it illustrates pretty neately how historians came to the conclusion that the Holocaust was real.    Here, this is an excerpt:    Michael Shermer has pointed out that the Nazis' own estimate of the number of European Jews was eleven million, and sixty percent of eleven million is 6.6 million. This is fairly close to the actual figure. (Actually, forty percent was a serious overestimate of the survival rate of Jews who were captured, but there were many Jews who escaped.)   In any case, most of the diary is quite mundane, and interesting only to historians. Did the supposed Jewish conspiracy forge seven thousand pages to insert just a few lines? How did they manage to know Goebbels' affairs intimately enough to avoid contradictions, e.g. putting him or his associates in the wrong city at the wrong date?   As even the revisionist David Cole has admitted, revisionists have yet to provide a satisfactory explanation of this document.    (Note: The original text contains hyper links as well!)

Nietzsche was not insane. He struggled from intense migraine headaches and some say syphilis. Throughout his life he managed to produce a prodigious amount of  work which make other philosophers look pale. The myth is he went insane. The truth is that he had a complete mental seizure that left him unable to do anything at all, including speaking. But what a life. A great "free spirit".

2rqKPnn8aa	Somerset (Seymour) and Paget, his key advisor, quickly established Somerset as leader of the Regency Council and, thus, he was effectively the undisputed ruler of the country. Both his domestic and foreign policies, however, aggravaged the precarious economic situation England was already in. As two major rebellions broke out across the country, the Protector Somerset began to blame all his problems on enclosures, raising resentment from the landowning elites. In addition, Somerset began to rule increasingly on his own, using Royal Proclamations extensively to implement his own will, thereby undermining the authority of the Regency Council and nobility. The Earl of Warwick, John Dudley, was  ambitious to replace Somerset and his ruthless decisiveness in dealing with Kett's rebellion made him an alternative. Seymour was removed by a conspiracy led by a combination of radicals and conservatives, which was able to capture the minor King Edward and take control of the Privy Chamber. The Earl of Warwick was left in charch and a counter-coup led by Southampton allowed him to place himself firmly on the reformer's side in matters of religion.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	In 1549 internal unrest resulted in a Catholic revolt in Devon, suppressed by Seymour, and a peasant uprising in Norfolk, suppressed by Dudley - this gave Dudley an opportunity to present himself as an able military leader.<br>   Further internal unrest coupled with military reverses against both France and Scotland in 1549 (for which Seymour was blamed) made him increasingly unpopular, especially as he had liberal ideas about the new religion.The senior nobles were worried that, with Edward V! obviously unlikely to live till adulthood, Seymour was trying to ingratiate himself with Princess Elizabeth, presumably with a view to maintaining his power after Edward VI had died. They therefore combined with Dudley (who had his own ideas about the next sovereign) to remove Seymour from power,citing the recent military reverses as a pretext.
f4Nn0W1xaa	Nah, it's not an addiction. You can quit any time you want, right? Wait, don't answer that ...     Actually, it kind of is, for most of us, because it is something that we do very habitually and feel a little lost without. It doesn't compare to a physical addiction. The main thing that suffers from my reading is my housework, after all. By the way, I always keep a book in the car. You just never know when you'll be stuck waiting somewhere.     The thing about reading as a hobby is that it's so portable. You can really take it everywhere, you can do it for hours on end, or just kill a few minutes with it. It's quiet, it doesn't require batteries (well, usually!), but a lot of people don't do it so they notice that you do.     All I'm saying is that I wouldn't worry about it too much. Just don't let it hurt your husband's feelings, if you can help it.|`|533z6lWpaa	A bookworm is someone that enjoys reading. I don't really see it as an addiction, though. You may want to curb your reading a bit, but hey, reading is better than doing drugs.|`|9VU9tafUaa	i think i am addicted to books but i'm fine with it in my opinion i can never have to many books lol|`|LAIC5Yvyaa	Yes, and I'm guilty of being a bookworm.|`|AA11202477	Okay - I keep a book in my bathroom. I'm usually reading at least two books at the same time, switching between them. I belong to a book club and plan to join another. There's a book in my purse now. When I went through training to be a caseworker, my nickname was Bookworm. When I was little, my mother wouldn't let me read at the table so I read the Cheerios box.  On the other hand, I don't view it as an addiction. I view it as a continuing search for knowledge. I know more about England than the average person because I love British mystery authors. I've learned a lot about child psychology reading Jonathan Kellerman. And Stephen King and Dean Koontz satisfy my love of the weird.  You're not an addict, just a person who realizes there is life outside their own little world and wants to experience it in the least expensive way possible.|`|hvJQSUOQaa	A bookworm is simply someone who is often found with their nose in a book.  I don't think you can be addicted to books.
c9NuCZnaaa	i am shocked and appalled. <br>  harry potter is a much more complex story so obviously it's only idiots who like twilight as their brains can't stretch too far into the imaginative world|`|wFVLP5l3aa	people compare the not because of the stories being anything like each other but because of the phenonemon of the stories<br>  how big a sucess they are and how they both have verry serious fan followings and are being made into movies|`|pAih5juAaa	Why not?  Who made the rule that no one could compare anything?<br>  <br>  You can compare any two or more things against each other.<br>  <br>  We compare the movie against it's book or real life events all the time.  For example the above two books and their movie version.  Two different mediums...  Or Titanic against the real event.<br>  <br>  Or Shakespeare against Dickens.<br>  <br>  Or two different cars (a morris minor against a BMW).<br>  <br>  It doesn't make it right or wrong.<br>  <br>  Of my readings most people are comparing two big selling young adult series with supernatural or the writing (styles) thereof.  Kind of a bit like comparing the writings of Austen and the Bronte sisters.  Or if someone wants compare them and Anne Rice or Shakespeare and Dickens or whoever...<br>  <br>  Doesn;t mean I need to read it or agree  with it...|`|e30a9e9e5716e986b609ef9728d116ccaa	! !man you are totally right and i really wanted to discuss this problem but i fear there is too much talking about twilight these days. the way you described harry potter.. dude.. if only i had the time.. it makes me want to read them all again! and that is so contrary to my beliefs. harry potter is totally diffrent.. it is worth reading. totally a diffrent world. that's why everyone has read harry potter, and only little teens have read twilight. I think they love the fact that twilight has sex in it. Don't get me wrong, i am not against this, everything carries a message(except twilight stuff).. girly-fans, go read some porno novels and get over it. Harry Potter is the best of these. I haven't read the lord of the rings, i think it can be compared to harry potter. twilight can only be comparable to these 2 because of it's fame, but it's like comparing The Jonas Brothers to Mettalica.|`|omp5Rpqqaa	don't know myself, people keep on comparing the 2, and I don't know why, the premise of the two are totally different, might as well compare the watchmen also =)|`|alAtUXvyaa	idk..they dont really have anything in common...i love both series, but they are completely separate from one another.|`|95c460c9bbd2609530690f8e73215021aa	know the authors of both books instead. wikipedia|`|Rm9mII46aa	How dare anybody choose one poorly written, topical children's novel they read over the other - crazy!

7KcVSB3Uaa	I strongly disagree with the literal interpretation that this is about individualism and nonconformity. Nowhere in the poem does Frost indicate we should take the road less traveled, or that one road would be superior to the other.<br>  <br>  Instead, he is lamenting the impossibility of not being able to take ALL roads, and regret at never being able to know where untrodden roads might have taken us. It is the fact that a choice is forced upon the narrator at all that he is sorry for; not WHICH choice he made.<br>  <br>  As for the "sigh," I have always read it as simply a sigh of regret at not being able to go back and travel every road in life, not as a sigh of regret over the way the narrator's life has progressed.<br>  <br>  If you're really a fan of the poem, you might enjoy hearing a recording of Frost reciting it himself!<br>  <a href="http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/15717" rel="nofollow">http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMI...</a>|`|ZzYy2szvaa	When I was taught about his poem last year in 10th Grade, we were taught that it was about this:  When a situation comes up in life that requires a decision, you, and ONLY you, can make that decision, and that decision of yours will have certain repercussions (probably both good and bad), which you must face and accept, which is why it is so important to think about both paths.<br>  <br>  I completely agree with what we were taught.  Sometimes people can try and influence your decisions, but you are the one that makes the final call, and then you can't blame other people afterwards, because the responsibility was yours, not the influencers'.<br>  <br>  Robert Frost's poem, "The Road Not Taken" was a good poem, but you should read his poem "Out Out-".  I think it's very good.  It's about a boy in a rural area that dies, but then no-one has time to actually grieve for him (except his family) because it doesn't really have anything to do with them and they must continue with their hectic lives.  The title is an abbreviation of the famous quote from Shakespeare's play "Macbeth" when Macbeth realises that his wife has committed suicide and he says "Out out, brief candle..."  meaning he understands the brevity and fragility of life (although in the play, he is rather demonic about it because he is almost saying "I don't care that my wife is dead because whether it is now or in 20 years time, she would've died sometime - everyone dies eventually")<br>  <br>  That poem, "Out Out-" was a huge eye-opener for me, and I have since tried to enjoy life to the fullest!<br>  <br>  Hope that answers your question =)|`|37E2yPGjaa	My interpretation of this poem is that it is telling us although we have many decisions in life, the good choices may not be as easy to choose as the bad ones. Most people will take the easy way out and choose the bad choice, but we should take the road less traveled and take the better, harder path, and not just choose what everyone else does. In the line "and that has made all the difference" it is saying how it has made you a better person because you chose the better, harder path.|`|95c460c9bbd2609530690f8e73215021aa	a challenge that no one dared to thread|`|Rm9mII46aa	I didn't know there was more than one interpretation. It's an allegory on choice and fate. The man meditates on how his life may be different depending on the simple choice of taking one path or another. He chooses one, and realizes he must forever live with the consequences of his choice.|`|ceBTTCPwaa	The poem has two recognized interpretations. One is a more literal interpretation, while the other is more ironic.<br>  Readers often see the poem literally, as an expression of individualism. Critics typically view the poem as ironic. – "'The Road Not Taken,' perhaps the most famous example of Frost's own claims to conscious irony and 'the best example in all of American poetry of a wolf in sheep's clothing.'" – and Frost himself warned "You have to be careful of that one; it's a tricky poem – very tricky."<br>  "Frost intended the poem as a gentle jab at his great friend and fellow poet who was also best friends with Edward Thomas, and seemed amused at this certain interpretation of the poem as inspirational." Frost was making a joke when making this poem about a friend he travelled with on the path one day. He faced a huge dilemma on what path to take even though they were both the same. "Though as for that the passing there Had worn them really about the same,And both that morning equally lay"(lines 9-11) the paths being the same is proven in this quote from the poem.<br>  <br>  According to the literal interpretation, the poem is inspirational, a paean to individualism and non-conformism.<br>  The poem's last lines, where the narrator declares that taking the road "less traveled by" has "made all the difference," can be seen as a declaration of the importance of independence and personal freedom. "The Road Not Taken" seems to illustrate that once one takes a certain road, there is no turning back. Although one might change paths later on, the past cannot be changed. It can be seen as showing that choice is very important, and is a thing to be considered.<br>  This interpretation is connected with misremembering the title as "The Road Less Traveled", since it places emphasis on the choice made, not the opportunities foregone.<br>  <br>  The ironic interpretation, widely held by critics, is that the poem is instead about regret and personal myth-making, rationalizing our decisions.<br>  <br>  In this interpretation, the final two lines:<br>  <br>  I took the one less traveled by, <br>  And that has made all the difference. <br>  <br>  are ironic – the choice made little or no difference at all, the speaker's protestations to the contrary. The narrator admits in the second and third stanzas that both paths may be equally worn and equally leaf-covered, and it is only in his future recollection that he will call one road "less traveled by".<br>  <br>  The sigh, widely interpreted as a sigh of regret, might also be interpreted ironically: in a 1925 letter to Crystine Yates of Dickson, Tennessee, asking about the sigh, Frost replied: "It was my rather private jest at the expense of those who might think I would yet live to be sorry for the way I had taken in life."|`|R5UIMBvcaa	I think about that poem whenever I'm hiking and come to a fork in the trail.  But there, of course, I can come back the next time and take the other fork.  Still, Frost's image of those two divergent roads is so vivid that it's hard to see such a place and not think of the poem and its implications.<br>  <br>  A couple of times in my life, I have temporarily, as I thought, diverged from the figurative route I was following and expected to return to and continue on indefinitely, but even as I ventured onto that "side road," lines in the poem would echo in my head: "Yet knowing how way leads on to way,/ I doubted if I should ever come back."  I didn't, and I'm glad.<br>  <br>  This isn't much of an interpretation, but it may add a little dimension to what you're looking for.

bS5wpKvOaa	Well, he wasn't the first to come up with the idea, but he gave enough evidence for it to become fact.<br>  <br>  <br>  He studied how all the planets and stars moved in relation to eachother, and noticed how planets (notably Venus), and the Moon, moved in relation to both the Earth and the Moon.<br>  <br>  Things like a Solar and Eclipse, and Lunar eclipse are impossible unless the Earth revolved around the sun.  (Most at the time thought Earth was the center, and everything orbited circular)  (I am sidetracking from Galileo there...)<br>  <br>  <br>  Most of his research was through study of Venus.<br>      If Venus is between Earth and the Sun, the phase of Venus must always be crescent or all dark.<br>      If Venus is beyond the Sun, the phase of Venus must always be gibbous or full.<br>  <br>  <br>  Basically, this his conclusion.  Very similar to Lunar/Solar eclipse thing that mentioned earlier (though not his work)|`|GlteTTauaa	he confirmed his observations .From September 1610, Galileo observed that Venus exhibited a full set of phases similar to that of the Moon. The heliocentric model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the Sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth-side of the Sun. In contrast, the geocentric model of Ptolemy predicted that only crescent and new phases would be seen, since Venus was thought to remain between the Sun and Earth during its orbit around the Earth. Galileo's observations of the phases of Venus proved that it orbited the Sun and lent support to (but did not prove) the heliocentric model.|`|4IZv07D6aa	Not by proving that the centre of the universe was located somewhere else.

Biologically, there's a kind of essence of every women & men. That's why the word came: Aphrodisiac! But philosophically, I must say that the only "MOTHERHOOD" is the essence of a woman. I'm sorry, I don't know which country you are from, but in the Indo-Pak subcontinent, women are treated as Goddess sometimes due to their that very special essence. Yes, to us, mother is goddess-like & every women we count as mother. (Thanks to that special essence of the women. I'm too proud of it)|`|yUudoO1Raa	Aristotle's concept of "Man qua man" covers both men and women.

It doesn't matter whether one becomes barren or childless. The essence is there! And that's the reason, we the Bangladeshi, Indians & some other countries give HIGH preference to the women. (A funny example: we use to address a 2/3 years old female-baby as mother....i.e., "Come on mother, let me feed you milk." )<br>  I don't know about the others but I do respect women only for that essence of motherhood. I know, one of them is my sister, one of them is my wife, one of them is my love, one of them is my real mom, aunt----yet I get the same essence from them.|`|sSdbfJpJaa	Yes, it's the motherhood, I think. My grandma (both maternal & paternal) & my senior relatives (both male & female) use to say so. By reading some great novels I came to know this myself.

VFUeemgxaa	Well what you wear would depend on your living situation. Jobless doesn't always equal homeless.<br>  <br>  If your character is homeless, I agree with what Lauren said: wear dirty, worn-out clothing. You could also go for the bag-lady look.<br>  <br>  However if you're jobless but a drug addict or something, you might not be as dirty. you might have a place to crash, but when you leave the house you just don't really care about how you look. So you clothes could be clean, but not fancy or stylish and your hair should be messy.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with the play - I'm glad to hear that the school is supporting doing RENT.|`|ZuWD3SVfaa	It depends on who  you are meant to be to what you need to wear, if you are one of the homeless people or a main character.<br>  Homeless people is easy ripped worn dirty clothing larger than you would normally wear check out your nearest opportunity shop (second hand clothing) <br>  It would help more though if you said who you needed to look like.<br>  <br>  Okay you are jobless so if you were trying to find work you would look a little better than a homless person, through together a mismatch of clothes, skirt, pants, a shirt maybe t-shirt if wearing a skirt have ladders in your stocking or have bright coloured ones, flat or high shoes is up to you. Messy hair would work as well, just do not try and macth everything up too much lke I said be a mis match
EJSdI25Naa	There was horseback, for one. Horse drawn wagons for another, which brought settlers to the west via inland. The horse and buggy was the zippy personal get-around of the time and the stage coach was another innovation of the time and even exported to Australia which helped open up that country. There were also river steam/paddle ships and sailing ships to cross the oceans. The red Indians already had invented their small birch bark canoes which trappers could use. A horse and cart would have ben used for transport, too. Slow, of course, but so were they all. Several of these are shown in detail in the 1939 classic film, "Gone with the Wind."<br>  <br>  North American foodstuffs that immediately come to my mind are chili peppers, tomatoes, corn on the cob and potatoes, of course. I could tentatively include buffalo beef with that but I won't.  Sea fish are common enough world wide and America does not have any individual claim to any of them. Oh, there are are also the red and white sweet potatoes, too. Pumpkins? I do not know but you can look that one up. To get references I will leave up to you to use your Internet, okay?<br>  <br>  Oh, you did say what foodstuff was the USA renown for in 1872. I think that would have to be wheat, an introduced crop which grew so well on the midwestern prairies and in such abundance that it could be exported to the rest of the world.|`|vOay8F4Yaa	I could tell you something about Victorian food and transportation, But that's mainly about what they did in Britain.

lPqxUkLEaa	14-year old boy's response - I thought it was beautiful. I came across it as I am finishing off a poetry analysis at the moment for my coursework and I was seeking some online help. This came as really refreshing and I dunno - makes you think.<br>  <br>  I loved the contrast at the beginning - "splintered skin," "aching pose." It created this sense of surrealism - Its the world of the doll as it would appear but it is filled with a longing and desolation. The "lily white sky" you used to describe the "perfect hands" is so illustrious - you get a fantastic image and it using the metaphor of the doll maker's hands as extending from the "sky" of the doll's world is just breathtaking. Maybe because you are still, technically, a developing individual (a student). Hey, but don't let it drag you down - I get it all the time :D<br>  <br>  My Brother's read it too and he is, I think, more poetic than I am and he suggests you rearrange your last stanza to this - <br>  <br>  Watching eyes to abandon tears,<br>  A sugar soaked mouth to drink the sun - <br>  She hears the tune with pointed ears<br>  And narrow heels that cannot run.<br>  <br>  BTW I am doing this devised theatrical performance based on "The Little Prince" by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry and this is such a wonderful companion. :) <br>  <br>  This is really wicked cos usually I am responding to a poem by a poet who probably died a few centuries ago.

Its free, easy to use, and provides very professional photo editing.<br>  <br>  Its amazing|`|AA12339318	To manipulate existing images, I only use the Adobe products.  I started of in SERIOUS digtal design about fifteen years ago with the CorelDraw suite of apps.  They were a great introduction to the possibilites of digital imaging.<br>  <br>  But frankly, I outgrew Corel and found the Adobe products much more intuitive and easier to carry from application to application.  By "intuitve" I mean that I can work in both, Photoshop and Illustrator in much the same way I used to with traditional design tools.  The folks who created these apps knew how an artist and designer "thinks" and made the tools available to those who know how to use them.  The difference is that the digital tools are faster, more accurate, and have finer controls than the traditional tools.  Plus, working digitally means that corrections and editing goes MUCH faster.<br>  <br>  And I can tell you from experience, for professional designers, time really DOES equal money.<br>  <br>  But to share with you what others have told me,  I know many pros that still use Corel products, including Painter, which was bought from another company.  I know artists that have been happily using Painter since it first came out and insist that, for their purposes, Painter is much better than Photoshop.  I know folks that use Paint Shop Pro, and a very few that swear by Gimp.<br>  <br>  To each his own, I think.  And when someone stakes his professional life on a design product, who am I to argue with him or her?

But make it really scary, because she doesn't know what is going on... And the ghost is a boy who was in her class in car crash when she was 7?|`|rl4NU9Zdaa	Well.<br>  <br>  I was home alone once.<br>  <br>  Totally scary stuff.<br>  <br>  Things were moving, and my radio turned on, by itself, WITHOUT it being plugged in.<br>  <br>  <br>  Use something like that, and build your story on.<br>  It really depends on what you LIKE writing.<br>  <br>  do what you FEEL like doing.|`|UOPWz06Vaa	You could do a scenario where the teen is being pressured into tryign drugs for the first time.

A friend of mine actually sang 'Malibu' by Hole (I know...) and won a comp using that, since it covers all the vocal range. <br>  <br>  Or you could sing a Goldfraap song like A&E, 'Joga' by Bjork which has lots of opportunities for belting out those soaring notes or even better would be something by Dusty Springfield...like "Windmills of Your Mind." This is an old song obviously, but you're better off aiming for something different, classy and cool (nothing is cooler than Dusty-come on, she has (had) the hottest voice ever on a white woman) which will make you stand out.

AA12095402	~"The greatest enemy of truth is very often not the lie - deliberate, contrived and dishonest - but the myth - persistent, persuasive and unrealistic." --John F Kennedy, June 11, 1962. <br>  <br>  Keep the man's own words in mind when you read about JFK.  His myth, based on his martyrdom, ignores the facts.  You have no bad points?  I have trouble finding good points.<br>  <br>  You could discuss how his and his daddy's mafia buddies stole the West Virginia primary for him in 1960.  Winning in W.Va. was absolutely critical for him to be a viable candidate.  Sam "Momo" Giancana, Johnny Rosselli, Santo Traficanti and Jimmy Hoffa made sure he won.  Then those same folks followed up by giving him Illinois in the general election.  Illinois put him in the White House.  First order of business?  He appointed his little brother Attorney General and turned Bobby loose on the mob and on Hoffa.<br>  <br>  You could discuss his women.  He and Bobby took turns with Marilyn Monroe.  The circumstantial evidence might not be enough to convict them for Marilyn's "suicide" but it would keep a jury in deliberation for a long, long time.  Then there is Judith Exner, whom he shared with Mom Giancana.  My favorite is Jackie's story about how when she found a strange pair of panties in her bed in the White House, she simply gave them to Jack and told him to return them to the poor little girl who forgot them.  The lady he shared with Timothy Leary supplied him with LSD.<br>  <br>  You could look into Max "Dr. Feelgood" Jacobson, who traveled everywhere with JFK and kept him supplied with speed, steroids and various other goodies, both prescription meds and street drugs.  Bobby's story about how he warned Jack repeated that his drug abuse was destroying his physical, mental and emotional health would fill a few hundred words.  Don't forget to include Jack's response to Bobby.  "I don't care if it's horsepiss.  It works".<br>  <br>  <br>  Look into the truth of the Missile Crisis.  Jack didn't end it.  He caused it.  The US had nukes in Turkey, within range of and targeted at places like Moscow.   Khrushchev first asked, then demanded, that the missiles be removed.  Kennedy refused.  The CIA had just botched the Bay of Pigs and had screwed up several assassination attempts on Castro (Traficanti and Rosselli were involved in one or two of those).  JFK authorized the Bay of Pigs invasion (it was Nixon's plan and carried  over to Kennedy's term) but specifically said he would not authorize US military assistance to aid the rebels.  CIA failed to tell him that their own estimates predicted failure unless there was US air and naval support - they also failed to mention during the briefings that they had irrefutable proof that the Soviets (therefore Castro) had gotten hold of the plans and knew dates, times, landing sites and troop strengths.  For once, Kennedy kept his word.  When the invasion went south, he refused to release US air and naval assets into the fray.  In any case, Khrushchev and Castro put their heads together and decided to put Nikki's nukes on Fidel's island.  Then Khrushchev offered to withdraw them on the condition that JFK withdraw ours from Turkey within six months and also promise to stop trying to kill Fidel and to never invade his island again.  Game, set, match Khrushchev.  He got everything he had wanted before sending the missiles to the Caribbean in the first place.  Side note to history:  The Soviets wanted their missiles within Castro's grasp even less than Uncle Sam did.  They were overjoyed when the had to remove them.<br>  <br>  Or you could mention the "Missile Gap".  JFK scared hell out of every American telling us about the disparity in the number of times the Soviets could incinerate the world as compared to the number of times we could.  There was a missile gap and Kennedy had the numbers.  He lied about them.  US missiles outnumbered USSR missiles by a ratio of almost 10 to 1.  Jack's lies helped him and Robbie McNamara initiate MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) and they launched the most costly, most dangerous, most insane arms race in the history of mankind.<br>  <br>  You could go back to the early years and look into how he and Bobby were key players on Joe McCarthy's team at HUAC during the Red Scare witch hunts and discuss the people and careers they destroyed based on rumor, innuendo and outright falsehoods.  Or you could go back a little farther and look into how Jack's medical condition was so bad that he could not pass a military physical during WWII so his daddy (because Jack needed a military record if he was going to run for office) twisted arms, called in favors and otherwise applied the pressures he, Joe, had refined during his bootlegging days, to get Jack into the Navy.  Then read the official reports on PT 109 at the Tokyo Express and decide for yourself whether or not the 109 was run over by the Amagiri as a result of Kennedy's gross negligence.  Campare his exploits after the 109 went down to those of George Ross and Leonard Thom and explain why JFK was decorated and why you've never heard of Ross or Thom.  Then check into the connection between Joe Kennedy and John Hersey and see if you can figure out why Hersey wrote his article for the New Yorker wherein Kennedy is depicted as some besainted super warrior rather than as the foul-up his military record shows him to have been.<br>  <br>  Ah, civil rights.  Look into the massive illegal wiretapping he and Bobby initiated.  Look into how he and Bobby brought all their influence to bear on A. Philip Randolf, Roy Wilkins, Bayard Rustin and James Farmer to call off their planned March on Washington (and what they said to each other and their closest aids and friends about the participants and their cause) and when they failed miserably in their efforts, how they reluctantly gave lip-service to their feigned support of the demonstration.  Had JFK had his way, Martin Luther King would not have delivered the "I Have A Dream" speech from the Lincoln Memorial.  (It was not an original speech and King had rehearsed various parts of it several times before at various venues, but for some reason the world believes it was unveiled on August 28, 1963.  Such is mythology.)<br>  <br>  There is a lot more.  A lot more.  For instance, his involvement in bring the Baath Party to Power in Iraq, and laying the groundwork (or authorizing it) for putting CIA's hand-picked golden boy, Saddam Hussein, at the helm there.  The CIA sponsored coups in Ecuador, Brazil, the Dominican Republic (twice) and the Congo (Zaire) happened on his watch.  He authorized the assassination of our buddy Ngo Dinh Diem.  He ran a secret (and illegal) war in Laos.  He sanctioned the interference in Cambodia that would eventually result in the rise to power off the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot's Killing Fields (LBJ and Nixon took part in that one, too).  <br>  <br>  You could go into his health, and how he and Joe made everyone back him in his lies about the gravity of his condition.  It is very possible he could not have survived another grueling campaign and even more likely he'd have died in office had he been re-elected.  His various diseases were debilitation enough, but that damage he was doing to himself with the Testosterone and other steroids he was using like you and I might use vitamins, the speed, the acid, the other street drugs and the addictive prescription meds he was on were killing him and exacerbating his existing conditions.  The medical reports are now in the public domain, but he lied to us about them then.  During the Missile Crisis, he was one nine separate scrips.  Air Force regulations prohibited an airman who was taking even a single ONE of the nine from talking on the radio in a supervisory capacity to a pilot in flight because of the way those meds affected one's mental acumin and cognative abilities, but Jack's finger was on the nuclear button while on all NINE.  Add to that the emotional and mental and psychological deterioration that his closest aids and family members have since remarked on - and the fact that he would mellow out by smoking grass in the Oval Office when things got tense. <br>  <br>  There was a reason that JFK pressured John Frankenheimer to produce "Seven Day in May".  Kennedy had little control over his Joint Chiefs of Staff (and they despised him) and even less over the CIA (they hated him) and he was (rightfully) afraid of a coup in the USA.  There was a reason JFK was afraid he would lose the '64 election.  While he was alive, he was reviled and ridiculed and not very much respected, at home or abroad.  Lee Harvey Oswald's bullets changed on that and in death and martyrdom he has achieved a fame and distinction the never could have attained or earned in life.   It is truly sad the J. Edgar Hoover's personal files were never made public.  I would love to see how much he had on Kennedy which the public record does not disclose.  I mean, everything I've mentioned here has been available for decades, but what did Hoover have that we still don't know about?  Not just on Kennedy, by Jack is our instant subject. <br>  <br>  I'm sorry.  You need 1500 words.  I think I'm close to  exceeding that, and this is just an outline and synopsos.  Mea Culpa.  It is difficult to keep anything as short as 1500 words and to do a topic justice at the same time.  Well, maybe you can go with just one or two of the points and condense it.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	You are going to find very little if anything negative about JFK's presidency on the internet.

What, have you finally checked into the truth of the man and seen the light?  Well done.<br>  <br>  You did forget to mention how the black vote helped put him over the top in '60, largely because of the efforts of King and the major Civil Rights leaders and then how he ignored their pleas for federal intervention to deal with the violence surrounding the Freedom Rides and the Albany Movement.  It took James Meredith, the U Miss riots, Birmingham and the national media (thank you Walter Cronkite) to get him off his apathetic, unconcerned butt, finally, in 1963.  Once he was sure it was not going to cost him at the polls, he pretended to care.<br>  <br>  Remember the Peace Corps.  As I recall, he claimed it was his idea.  Doesn't the record reflect that Hubert Humphrey came up with that one and JFK campaign aids asked if Jack could "borrow" it in the final stages of the campaign?  HHH was more concerned about the program than the accolades and agreed (anyhow, Hubie had already lost the nomination).  Hmmm, brother Bobby, with no experience whatsoever is already the Chief Law Enforcement Officer (Atty Gen) in the land, who else in the family needs a job?  Oh, yeah, sister Eunice married that Sargent Shriver guy dad hired to our Merchandise Mart.  Let's give it to him.  Unlike Bobby, Shriver was eminently qualified and did a helluva job.  Of course, he was related by marraige and not by blood so he came from a better gene pool.  Can't say much for his daughter's selection of a husband tho.  Shriver founded Head Start, VISTA, Job Corps, Community Action, Upward Bound, Foster Grandparents, Special Olympics, the National Center on Poverty Law, Legal Services, Indian and Migrant Opportunities and Neighborhood Health Services, and directed the Peace Corps but his brother-in-law took the credit.<br>  <br>  His domestic policies were a flop overall and the "New Frontier" was a pipedream that never approached fruition.  The Soviets played him like a fiddle as the Missile Crisis proved.  He did foster a building and construction spurt in the US when all those fall-out shelters were built as a result of his lies about the missile gap and terror induced by MAD.<br>  <br>  The fifty mile walk phenomenon he started kind of backfired.  It gave us the stamina to hit the streets and do all those marches we did back in the good old days of the 60s when people actually gave a damn about what was going on at home and around the world and were willing to stand up and be heard.  <br>  <br>  His "The Alliance for Progress" in Latin America fell flat on its face - he said because the leaders of the region were not ready for democracy, but he failed to mention that 80% of those leaders had been put in power through CIA coups, assassinations and overthrows of democratically elected reform governments during his and Ike's tenures.  Golly Gee.   We put people like Trujilo, Armas and Papa Doc in power then wonder why hundreds of thousands (millions?) of bodies start turning up everywhere, then complain that our boys don't want their victims to be able to vote?  Shucks, that just ain't right.  Oh, well, nobody ever accused Kennedy of being honest.<br>  <br>  You mentioned Judith Exner (aka Campbell) and Marilyn.  How about Ellen Rometsch (and her close connections to the upper echelon of the East German Communist Party) or Mariella Novotny (who was splitting her time - and spreading her legs - pretty evenly between Jack, Bobby, Bobby Bake and several Soviet spies according to now declassified FBI records)  Poor Mariella.  She complained that "it was over so fast" when describing a typical roll in the hay with JFK.  The British investigation of the Profumo Affair disclosed the Kennedy Brothers/Novotny Connection in late '63.  Dallas stopped the presses on that one.  Leave us not forget Audrey Hepburn, Lee Radziwill (Jackie's sister) and Jayne Mansfield or Gene Tierney and Marlena Deitrich.  Angie Dickinson called her romp with the prez “the best 20 seconds of my life”, but Jackie said he "just goes too fast and falls asleep".  Maybe the testosterone was not for medical reasons after all.  There were scores of others that have been documented publicly, from "Fiddle and Faddle" (as the Secret Service code-named the 21 year old aids he was doing in the Oval Office and 19 year old Marion "Mimi" Beardsley (since the age of consent in DC was 21 at the time, Mimi doing Mimi was statutory rape) to Pamela Turnure, Jackie's press secretary to Suzy Chang (another disclosure of the Profumo investigation).  Brother-in-law Peter Lawford kept a pad for him in California and supplied women, as did the rest of the "Rat Pack".   In a pinch, he rented whores (apparently by the minute).  Several of the Kennedy women were murdered and the murders to this day remain unsolved.<br>  <br>  His PT 109 crew called him "Shafty" and complained he spent more time chasing women than Japanese.  <br>  <br>  Joe illegally spent $300,000 to get him elected to the House of Representatives in 1946.  In his report to the Mass Sect'y of State, Kennedy reported that  he had had no campaign contributions or expenditures.  (I suppose the campaign Joe ran was not Jack's own, so it wasn't really perjury.)<br>  <br>  Don't forget Texas in 1960.  JFK/LBJ carried the state by 46,000 votes, but tens of thousands of votes went missing and The New York Herald Tribune reported that 100,000 votes tallied for Kennedy-Johnson never existed in the first place.<br>  <br>  There is so much available about the man on-line, if you just punch a few keys it would takes weeks to read it all.  Most of it comes for personal papers of friends, family, former aids and government documents.  I've decided to lay off Kennedy bashing for awhile. It is just too damn easy there is so much corroboration.

Culturally, these can be considered part of the broader region of Ancient India.<br>  <br>  Siddhārtha Gautama  was a spiritual teacher in the northern region of the Indian subcontinent who founded Buddhism. He is generally seen by Buddhists as the Supreme Buddha (Sammāsambuddha) of our age. The time of his birth and death are uncertain: most early 20th-century historians date his lifetime from c. 563 BCE to 483 BCE; more recently, however, at a specialist symposium on this question, the majority of those scholars who presented definite opinions gave dates within 20 years either side of 400 BCE for the Buddha's death, with others supporting earlier or later dates.<br>  <br>  Gautama, also known as ?ākyamuni or Shakyamuni ("sage of the Shakyas"), is the key figure in Buddhism, and accounts of his life, discourses, and monastic rules are believed by Buddhists to have been summarized after his death and memorized by his followers. Various collections of teachings attributed to Gautama were passed down by oral tradition, and first committed to writing about 400 years later. Early Western scholarship tended to accept the biography of the Buddha presented in the Buddhist scriptures as largely historical, but currently "scholars are increasingly reluctant to make unqualified claims about the historical facts of the Buddha's life and teachings."|`|8492491d97ee630da8a149444b0b195baa	Lord Buddha was born in Lumbini and raised in the small kingdom or principality of Kapilvastu, both of which are in modern day Nepal.

You do it by figuring out what you can write that's likely to sell, to whom, and doing it.<br>  <br>  Virtually all areas are competitive, from greeting cards to magazine articles to erotica, but the best is sold to legitimate markets. Most writers do not make a living at it, but supplementing one's income is a perfectly reasonable goal.<br>  <br>  Remember, no agent, publisher, editor, etc. needs one cent from you. There are many scams hoping to trap the beginner.|`|qXREoORzaa	I'm only 13 and i can kind of understand as im busy with school and teenage life. Im writing at the moment, so the best thing is to write. Simple as that. Once you get the ideas flowing write them down and go from there. Depending on whether you want to be an magazine journalist or a novelist, i only know bout the novel side of things. You need to make a manuscript when your done, and send it off to publishing houses. Basically just write. Then take it from there :)

I quote below a few quotations from the book.<br>  <br>  "Verify, with hardship, there is relief." (Qur'an 94:6).<br>  Eating follows hunger, drinking follows thirst, sleep comes after restlessness, and health takes the place of sickness.  The lost will find their way, the one in difficulty will find relief, and the day will follow the night.<br>  <br>  "Perhaps Allah may bring a victory or a decision according to His Will." (Qur'an 5:52).<br>  Inform lthe night of the coming morning, the light of which will permeate the mountains and valleys.  Give to the afflicted tiding of a sudden relief that will reach them with the speed of light or with the blinking of an eye.<br>  If you see that the desert extends for miles and miles, then know that beyond that distance are green meadows with plentiful shade.  If you see the rope tighten and tighten, know that it will snap.<br>  <br>  Tears are followed by a smile, fear is replaced by comfort, and anxiety is overthrown by serenity.  When the fire was set for him, Prophet Ibraheem (Abraham) (may peace be upon him) did not feel its heat because of the help received from his Lord.<br>  "We (Allah) said: 'O' fire! Be you coolness and safety for Ibraheem". (Qur'an 21:69).<br>  <br>  The sea would not drawn Prophet Moses (may peace be upon him), because he uttered in a confident, strong, and truthful manner. "Nay, Verify! With me is my Lord, He will guide me. (Qur'an 26:62).<br>  <br>  The Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) told Abu Bakr in the cave that Allah was with them--then peace and tranquility descended upon them.<br>  <br>  Those that are slaves of the moment see only misery and wrechedness.  This is because they look only at the wall and door of the room, whereas they should look beyond such barriers as are set before them.<br>  <br>  Therefore do not be in despair: it is impossible for thing to remain the same.  The days and years rotate, the future is unseen, and every day Allah has matters to bring forth.  You know it not, but it may be that Allah will afterwards bring some new thing to pass.  And very, with hardship there is relief.|`|5WaZWeY8aa	Perhaps, dear, you are running away from "something".

You shut yourself off from the world but you're as reliant on it as ever- without the internet you could plunge into even more madness.<br>  <br>  Ordinarily people can live life fully. They normally can smile and joke and be. But you need to find that outlet that lets you break free from the nothingness that you call your life. For me, it was travel- travel to places so foreign and exotic that even walking outside is an assault on the senses. Being overwhelmed by something more powerful than what you're accustomed to can be a good way to overcome one's strangeness.<br>  <br>  Take a plane to the Himalayas and do a 3-week trek.
NhFRsflwaa	This is kinda difficult because if she runs away to any place like that the people are obligated (or at least I believe they are) to call the authorities.

It doesn't have to be school-related. It can be something that holds a significance in her life. Somewhere she feels safe/like a different person/life has a purpose. <br>  <br>  Say, a person she's known (the grocer's son/daughter); the park... The soup kitchen's also a good idea.

The person who would give him/her self no choice of a beautiful person with a beautiful personality has no self-esteem and willfully chooses to be seen with someone ugly. That does happen in real life.<br>  <br>  What is unnatural is that only those two choices should be available, when we know there are many intermediate choices. It's as if I asked you would you rather eat an apple full of worms or a worm that is nutritious. You would properly say something like, "I'll take a perch dinner, thank you."

A brilliant young artist tossed from her home with only the clothes on her back, Cerynise must now turn to a childhood companion for assistance-the dashing sea captain Beauregard Birmingham-and beg him to provide her with passage to the Carolinas.

So talk TO the students, don't talk AT them or talk DOWN to them. Most importantly, be yourself.<br>  <br>  The best way to "spice it up" is to make it interesting. Think about the history documentaries you've watched on TV. They all tell a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end and they allow the viewer to follow along the trail as they uncover or discover new things. You need to do the same thing in your presentation. Take your audience with you on a journey, don't reveal everything up front, but keep them guessing what might come next and be sure to leave them feeling that they've been somewhere at the end.<br>  <br>  Oh, and always speak S L O W L Y!

We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

Sorry to be blunt, but there it is. <br>  If you really love her, help her to heal by all means- by showing her not all men take advantage of her when she is weak. She wants to sleep with you because she doesn't know how else to behave with men she is close to. Prove you are different. And then when she is in a better frame of mind, put it to her you want a relationship with her, but be prepared for her to not feel the same way towards you.<br>  The risk you run by getting with her now is that if or when she changes her behaviour ( possibly through therapy or similar) she may not need/want you, and you end up very hurt and alone. And another important point- if you can 'actually get rid of her problems' you are her protector/ healer-therapist/ rescuer- if that were in a professional capacity the relationship would be taboo. You can be either/or but not both at the same time. <br>  Think about what you really want|`|nRnokrwKaa	Mate, you sound like a top bloke to be fair, she'll be lucky to have you. If you don't feel comfortable sleeping with her, then don't. Let her know how you feel about her and make sure she knows that by not wanting to sleep with her right away you're not rejecting her: that may come to be a factor as low self-confidence often comes with people who find it hard to trust others. Ask her out normally and then take it slow, she'll see how nice a guy you are compared to those other men if she sees that you don't need to have her sleep with you in order for you to like her that much. In essence, let her know how you feel, and then let those feelings guide you. If you feel like sleeping with her now would be taking advantage then don't do it, take it slow instead. <br>  <br>  Fair play mate, and good luck.|`|W7l1awFPaa	Continue listening to her and trying to sort out what is best for her and for you.

Tell her that :)|`|bc8c5c1452aca6682b2a081f91596c9aaa	First question. Do you really think you are in love with her or you are lusting for her beauty? If you love her and do not want to hurt her, you will control yourself because the last thing that a man who love the girl is to further hurt her. Spend more time with her, and telling her that you RESPECT her so much to take sex with her so casually. <br>  <br>  Sometime, beautiful girls think that people are only interest in their beauty and body and not interested in the real them. Showing constraint and control and slowly developing the love will not only win her in body but only conquer her heart. The love will then last. If not it will be just one of those spur of a moment.<br>  <br>  Hope you make the right decision. God bless.|`|bljvdBUsaa	Judging by your other questions that you've posted I'd say you're a Class 1 twat.

And when you get a relationship you want to resort back to having free sex and no relationship...... <br>  <br>  I think you have an over stretched imagination and that you should stick with online relationships.<br>  <br>  Am I right or am I right?

If it's on it may sharpen the pencil strokes too much and make the drawing look harsh.

Wi0LBsVbaa	Knowing the meaning of life is not part of Christian theology. Having faith that there is meaning is the crux. This is part of loving God. It is easy to figure out how to love other people, but to love God, you need to trust that what happens is for you, from him, out of love for you. Faith is when you can relax into the unknown. It sounds contradictory but part of the meaning of life is not knowing the meaning. If we knew the unknown what purpose would faith serve?|`|HQ1t2ayLaa	Because you are letting the devil attack your mind. You need to continue to pray until you hear from the lord.|`|AA12155794	Simply believe and reading will have no effect.Have to translate it into action in day to day life.Realisation will come but not in one day or two<br>  Its a long perseverance.|`|dbkQhA2Qaa	The love of God is not a noun.  It is a verb that must be exercised to be recognized.  Feeling down or doubtful, take a walk on the other side.  Do something for someone less fortunate than you.  Go to a nursing home and share time with those stuck in there.  Go to a Children's Hospital and visit terminally sick children.  Go to soup line and help serve the hungry.  Take food to the homeless on the streets of a large city.  We have no idea how much a mug of hot chocolate and a peanut butter and  jelly sandwich means to someone until we see people reaching out in hope of just having enough for them too.  We become real believers when we help make a difference in others lives...those less fortunate than us.  Take a chance and change your ways...jump in and go MAD....Make A Difference in someone else's life and feel your Christian joy evolve and dare it to be maintained and stopped.  You will be a bonfire for Christ and your light will certainly shine for the Lord.|`|cTvP6j7Haa	Although you proclaim being Christian still means you have to put in the work. Live like one, think like one, study like one and meditate on being one.  There are no free lunches in this world.  All is work.<br>  Peace.<br>  <br>  P.S.  The meaning of life is.... you.  Without you there will be no life. No knowing of being.|`|F8OrjeWsaa	The meaning of life is to give life meaning.|`|6zuVB1graa	Because unfortunately (or maybe not so unfortunately.  I'm not so sure) we are finite.  You may have God, but may not know the meaning of life.  It's just how we were made.  Possibly, all together, we could come up with the meaning for life, but a group of that magnitude would be very hard to gather.  Even with all these walks of life, characteristics, ideas, etc. that are offered to the table, we still may not know the meaning of life.<br>  <br>  It's okay to feel like this.  You can try to find the meaning of life, and you should try, but don't feel discouraged if you cannot.  The honest attempt is worth a lot.  Faith will help you on your way.|`|ZE88oBuuaa	Because you have doubt and disconnection from the God you belive in.  In my opinion, the meaning of life is to live, spread your offspring and die.  Just like any other functioning organism.  Would be selfish on humans to say we have some sort of special meaning just because of our complex brains.   I mention complex brains because we can't face the fact that there is no god.  So we have to make a story and lie behind why the earth was made and our moral code.   We can't just accept that there really isn't a meaning behind life behind living and dieing.  It's almost like evolution has doomed some of our minds for being so complex that we question things that other organisms wouldn't even think of.|`|OsauNtKPaa	I feel the same way.<br>  <br>  I don't think we doubt God, but we doubt religion. There is a difference. Well God is the almighty God....<br>  <br>  ...but religion is the set of rules, guides, the book that should have all the answers. But sometimes we get confused by it as its complex or we see contradictions from other religious books. or mankind's interpretations take on different point of views from others. This all raises issues and makes us insecure in religion, thus we are insecure when thinking about the in meaning of life...|`|Du8QhOmaaa	Haha nobody knows. <br>  "God" is just playing chess with little people .|`|3rhmXa66aa	DING DING DING DIIIIINNNNNNNNNNGGGGGGGGGG See?

Faith in god does not equal enlightenment.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but its true.  For most, belief in god is rather unemotional.  Some make it out to be a great, moving experience, and that makes us who don't feel that feel like we're missing out.  But we aren't.<br>  <br>  Just keep believing.

34VTIYpjaa	this probably isn't the answer you're going to want to hear...but it's going to vary significantly from person to person.<br>  it depends mostly on ankle strength and flexibility, and often you may be asked to go to a dance physio to be assessed before you go on pointe. <br>  make sure you are doing lots of rises, and pointing and flexing your feet....and it might be a good idea to invest in a theraband (a rubber elastic thing).<br>  don't worry :) you'll get there.....|`|C3OmbZi5aa	If you have only done ballet for a year, you probably have a few years to go before you get on pointe. You don't say how old you are, but generally teachers don't let you go on pointe before you're 12 or 13 years old. It really is your teacher's call, though. You have to have strong enough feet and ankles before you start pointe, though, or else you can really hurt yourself.|`|37E2yPGjaa	It varies from person to person. When i first started pointe, the second class and i was up en pointe doing pirouettes. others, they may never be able to get en pointe. some in my class never completely got on full pointe. If you have strong ankles, it may only take you a day. If you have weak ankles, it may take you a very long time almost a year to be able to get en Pointe without wobbling.  If your feet are average, about 2 weeks to a month can perfect your pointe dancing. Pinking the right type of shoe for your foot type can help also.

A lord granted land to a vassal in return for military and other services; lord and vassal swore reciprocal oaths, of protection by the lord, loyalty by the vassal; the vassal received as fief or fee a conditional gift of land, to "hold" and draw revenue from.  Older historians, including Marx, used the term feudalism for the whole medieval social order, a peasant society dominated by a military, land-owning aristocracy.  Modern usage generally restricts the word to the network of vassal-lord relations among the aristocracy.  The system governing the peasant's relation to the lord, the economic foundation of medieval society, is usually designated the "manorial system".  Feudalism meant much to the lord, little to the peasant.<br>  <br>  The cooperative relationships of the peasants belonged to what might be called the village aspect of their existence, that existence also had a manorial aspect.  In Northern Europe and in England following the Norman conquest, the countryisde came to be organized into land-management units called manors.  The manor is usually defined as an estate held by a lord, comprising a demsne directly exploited by the lord, and peasant holdings from which he collected rents and fees.  The village might coincide with the manor, or it might not.  It might be divided into two or more manors, or it might form only part of a manor.<br>  <br>  The relationship embodied in the feudal and manorial terms were simple enough in theory: In the manorial system, peasant laboured for lord in return for land of his own: ion the feudal system, lord held lands from king or overlord in return for supplying soldiers on demand.  In practice the relationships were never so simple and got more complicated over time.  All kinds of local variations developed, and both pesaant labor service and knightly military service were increasingly converted into money payments.<br>  <br>  Whatever the effects of the two overlapping systems, they did not prevent villages from flourishing, until everywhere villages began to crowd up against each other.  Where once the silent European wilderness had belonged to the wolf and the deer, villagers now ranged - with their lord's permission - in search of firewood, nuts, and berries, while their pigs rooted and their cattle and sheep grazed.'|`|65lTdKNgaa	becasue the royal family was seen as pure and decendant of god so everyone thought they were perfect and anyone who isnt in the royal family or owns and is not good..<br>  <br>  does that make sense

People were weren't very exposed to it might still have retained the sense of glory that had lured many young men to war. However, those who had more association with the war had by then learned that it was an ugly business, made even more so by the new warfare technology.<br>  <br>  Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon - whom he idolized - fought in the war, so there a good bit of confusion about how these soldiers could be so depressing about something that was their work, and that was part of their everyday lives. Some refused to believe that the situation was so bad, indeed saying that it was unpatriotic, perhaps even a form of surrender because they didn't look forward to the goodness the war could bring. (Although I doubt any 'goodness' was worth all the death.) But at the same time, there were people who had been hurt by the war and agreed that it was time to disillusion the population, to let them know more about what they'd gotten into.<br>  <br>  After the war, pacifism became much more acceptable in hindsight of the horrors of injury, and also the death toll. But before the war, and during it - particularly once conscription was introduced - pacifism or unwillingness to fight got you labeled a coward, and you could be mocked or osctracized for it. In 1918, the general impression would have been neither quite one nor the other.|`|1hvrQYWiaa	War poetry was on the whole received positively (publishers don't publish writers that don't sell).<br>   The best war poets,such as Owen and Sassoon, produced verse of searing power that could be appreciated as great literature in its own right.<br>   Post WW1, mainstream writers such as T. S. Eliot  were writing anti-war poetry ('Wasteland' being a good example) so it remained sufficiently popular to be widely available on a commercial basis.

What the best Commercial agents want to see on your resume are good commercial classes, improv, and cold reading.<br>  <br>  You can get an agent multiple ways. Here are a few common ways:<br>  -Mail in an unsealed manilla envelope with a CONCISE coverletter and headshot with the resume stapled on the back.

yUudoO1Raa	"Throughout Confessions, Saint Augustine gains, embraces, metamorphs’, grasps, utilizes and wallows in his painstaking existence as he searches out a love. His heart, his mind and his body, are consistently and forever seeking a sense of satisfaction. It seems as though Augustine was instilled with the desire to love and to be loved; without both he would be left with an empty soul and forever remain unhappy. Augustine spent much of his time loving; loving in secret and in quite conflicting manners. Charles had many loves in his life including: his mother Monica, his mistresses, evil, wisdom, church, Catholicism, Christ Jesus and God. With so many loves, what can be said about what Augustine’s true passion and desire for love, and to be loved? Augustine goes about his life with ever changing and conflicting views, however, in the end, all he is searching for is a true love that will never die and will forever be." <a href="http://www.exampleessays.com/viewpaper/40177.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.exampleessays.com/viewpaper/4...</a><br>  <br>  "Augustine’s analysis of fundamental human loves provides insight into some of the anthropological determinants of ecological degradation. This discussion is framed by Augustine’s distinction between caritas, as seeking one’s final end in God, and cupiditas, as seeking one’s final end in that which is other than God.<br>  "Augustine's central point is that we are not to seek our happiness, our final end, in things of this world. Properly ordered love seeks God as its final end; improperly ordered love seeks its rest in the world. These loves are mutually incompatible as they entail divergent final commitments. This is the essence of Augustine's distinction between caritas and cupiditas, love of God and improper love of the world." much more at <a href="http://www.quodlibet.net/benzoni-love.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.quodlibet.net/benzoni-love.sh...</a><br>  <br>  "His understanding on love and sex was nothing but pagan, twisted and corrupted.<br>  "The Church's attitude about sex goes back to  Augustine, [who's] viewpoints are one of the major reasons the Church views sex as it does today.<br>  "He believed that sex was sinful. (Can you imagine God saying to Adam and Eve, "Be fruitful and multiply," and when they did, He punished them for it?)<br>  "St. Augustine believed that Adam and Eve's problem in the Garden was because of sex. "He believed that the account of Adam and Eve's sin against God in Genesis 3 uses symbolic language, that the 'forbidden fruit' actually represented sex. He thought Eve conceived and bore children in pain (Genesis 3:16) because sex is sinful, and any kind of sexual activity brings pain.<br>  "According to St. Augustine, human beings should ask God's forgiveness for even thinking about sex and should abstain whenever possible. In fact, Augustine said, 'Men and women who want to be righteous in God's sight should live in celibacy; i.e., without sexual contact.' <br>  "Augustine's teachings gave theological structure to feelings of guilt and shame in a biological drive. However, the enforcement of the doctrine of sexual guilt was difficult. The struggle was to impose celibacy on the clergy. It was only moderately successful until well into the Middle Ages.'<br>  <br>  "In other words, Christians had a hard time accepting Augustine's ideas about sex. They weren't certain that God wanted them to live in celibacy. The church struggled to keep its leaders obedient to this rule. In fact, sexual prohibition was one of the first doctrines that Martin Luther and the other Reformers broke away from. Luther left the monastery to marry a nun." <a href="http://www.patriarchywebsite.com/bib-patriarchy/deception-augustine-love-sex.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.patriarchywebsite.com/bib-pat...</a>

You have too much of a single component in a composition then the piece may draw the audiences eye in an unfavorable manner. In some black and white only pieces, if the artist has too much of one value, it may make the overall piece difficult to read.

ZB9zkbxxaa	Mount Tambora experienced several centuries of inactivity before 1815, known as dormancy, as the result of the gradual cooling of hydrous magma in a closed magma chamber. Inside the chamber at depths between 1.5–4.5 km (5,000–15,000 ft), the exsolution of a high pressure magma fluid formed during cooling and crystallisation of the magma. Overpressure of the chamber of about 4–5 kbar was generated and the temperature ranged from 700 °C–850 °C (1,300–1,500 °F).<br>  <br>  In 1812, the caldera began to rumble and generated a dark cloud. On 5 April 1815, a moderate-sized eruption occurred, followed by thunderous detonation sounds, heard in Makassar on Sulawesi (380 km or 236 mi), Batavia (now Jakarta) on Java (1,260 km or 783 mi), and Ternate on the Molucca Islands (1400 km or 870 mi). What was first thought to be sound of firing guns was heard on 10–11 April on Sumatra island (more than 2,600 km or 1,615 mi away).On the morning of 6 April, volcanic ash began to fall in East Java with faint detonation sounds lasting until 10 April.<br>  <br>  At about 7 p.m. on 10 April, the eruptions intensified.Three columns of flame rose up and merged. The whole mountain was turned into a flowing mass of "liquid fire".Pumice stones of up to 20 cm (8 inches) in diameter started to rain down at approximately 8 p.m., followed by ash at around 9–10 p.m. Hot pyroclastic flows cascaded down the mountain to the sea on all sides of the peninsula, wiping out the village of Tambora. Loud explosions were heard until the next evening, 11 April. The ash veil had spread as far as West Java and South Sulawesi. A "nitrous" odor was noticeable in Batavia and heavy tephra-tinged rain fell, finally receding between 11 and 17 April.<br>  <br>  "    The first explosions were heard on this Island in the evening of the 5th of April, they were noticed in every quarter, and continued at intervals until the following day. The noise was, in the first instance, almost universally attributed to distant cannon; so much so, that a detachment of troops were marched from Djocjocarta, in the expectation that a neighbouring post was attacked, and along the coast boats were in two instances dispatched in quest of a supposed ship in distress."<br>  <br>      —Sir Thomas Raffles' memoir<br>  <br>  The explosion is estimated to have been at scale seven on the Volcanic Explosivity Index. It had roughly four times the energy of the 1883 Krakatoa eruption. An estimated 100 km3 (38.6 mi3) of pyroclastic trachyandesite was ejected, weighing approximately 1.4×1014 kg.This has left a caldera measuring 6–7 km (4–5 mi) across and 600–700 m (2,000–2,300 ft) deep.The density of fallen ash in Makassar was 636 kg/m2. Before the explosion, Mount Tambora was approximately 4,300 m (14,000 ft) high, one of the tallest peaks in the Indonesian archipelago. After the explosion, it now measures only 2,851 m (9,300 ft).<br>  <br>  The 1815 Tambora eruption is the largest observed eruption in recorded history (see Table I, for comparison).The explosion was heard 2,600 km (1,600 mi) away, and ash fell at least 1,300 km (800 mi) away.Pitch darkness was observed as far away as 600 km (370 mi) from the mountain summit for up to two days. Pyroclastic flows spread at least 20 km (12.5 mi) from the summit.
fzU2hP4yaa	Tambora sits near a subduction zone.  This is where one tectonic plate is being forcibly shoved underneath another (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonics)." rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tectonics).</a>  As the subducting plate slides further into the earth it begins to melt.  Because the rock in that plate contains a fair amount of water - it used to be ocean bottom - it is lighter and beings to rise, melting and pushing its way upward in huge teardrop shaped masses.  <br>  <br>  When one of these rising masses of melted rock (we call it magma) reaches the surface you get a volcano.  In the case of Tambora the magma was thick and sticky, and there was a lot of steam held in it.  When this stuff reached air it went off like a cork from a champagne bottle.  Big boom, lots of noise.|`|BTk2yLqbaa	I assume that, like all eruptions, it was caused by the intense pressure of CO2 cooked out of rocks in a subduction zone by Earth's internal heat.

RnjuNJ6faa	Ask yourself these questions :<br>  <br>  1. What kind of boutique you intended to open? I presume is a fashion boutique for Kids, Adults or infant? What you intended to sell or fashion in your boutique? T-shirt, jeans or dress, pants, suit? For working adults or teens? <br>  <br>  2. What is your customer targeted segment? Eg. Working adults, teens or mothers? Price ranges? <br>  <br>  3. Location of your shop? Is it in an up-town places or neighbourhood?<br>  Check around those shops near you.<br>  <br>  The above is just some question which in valid to your design selection.<br>  <br>  Eg. Adults & Working clothes. Classy, elegant TYPO design with 1-2 color. Eg. Black color with golden trim and afew diamond for contrast on your letters. Indicated exclusiveness, expensive and posh. Or you might use some jewellaries to trace of your name. It will give alot of sparks and colors to your TYPO.<br>  <br>  Eg. Situated in up-town shop which target mainly working adults and well off couples. You would not want to look cheaply comparing those others around you. Look around.<br>  <br>  If your boutique is mainly for teens, then you might consider a design with logo. Brighter colors, funky, unique TYPO lettering. Simple and full of life.<br>  <br>  There is alot of other alternatives....depending on your kind of boutique selection.<br>  <br>  Gd Luck|`|3959c9601f288bcc65fe36767a2df0c0aa	A logo is a graphic representation of a company name.

What they have become and what underworld followers have emerged from that. I would read more on the bible, and the scriptures that were not placed in the bible. There are a lot of scrolls in Rome and other churches that were not placed in the King James version and other versions of the HOLY BIBLE.

XvO4iLk0aa	G Most people are neurologically wired for conformity and most cultures enforce it.|`|Z4YSnC3gaa	There are many reasons. It is problematic to assume that all people who do X are doing so for the same reason -- although it is a possibility.<br>  <br>  That you chose the terms taboo and forbidden suggests that the behaviour violates strong moral codes which is likely to rouse anger and disgust in the peers. That the behaviour is natural is irrelevant generally in society when it comes to people passing judgment and then acting on it when someone doesn't conform to the social norm.<br>  <br>  It can be a targeted event that one or two people have organized and others are following suit for a variety of reasons.<br>  <br>  Many people often forget to tell some one "please stop" or to even ask the person about their behaviour.|`|xGI9z01Maa	Unfortunately, this is a part of human nature.

FEVQisMGaa	But prose description can be poetic, too...<br>  <br>  I suppose it (poems) appeal to broader range because the poem is (for a lack of better prose) simpler.

Nature contains purposive organisms, certain human beings, for example Aurelius, or Jonas Salk, or Lincoln, and it may contain non-human purposive organisms such as Whirlaway, or whales, or White Fang (see Jack London), or various chimps, apes, gorillas, etc. In the past it contained Neanderthalis and Cro Magnon, and even Homo Habilis (Lucy of the Olduvai Gorge) who may have been purposive. But nature as a rule is non-purposive, it's not even sentient, it's a bunch of exploding and collapsing stuff in a violent universe, it's  the world of Dr. Vishniak -- little one-celled organisms swimming around in your tears, and kisses.<br>  <br>  Nature, as whole, is profligate, wasteful, and non-purposive. The fact that it follows laws does not make it purposive. When a ball rolls down an inclined plane, it follows laws, but it has no purpose (see also Omar Khayyam -- the ball no question makes of aye or no's, but left or right, as strikes the player goes.)<br>  <br>  The fact that we see laws in nature that are elegant and simple -- the for example the "path of least energy" -- the watercourse way or the way of a particle in a vacuum -- does not imply nihil agit frustra.<br>  <br>  Lucretius himself observed the excess of nature, the kaliedoscopic quality in which some things fall into place, but many fall randomly, on stony or on fertile ground willy nilly.<br>  <br>  Nature moves. I'm not sure it "does". To do is already putting the rabbit in the hat -- we say people do things -- but what is Niagara Falls doing? Isn't it just water in the motion of falling. If electricity is created, isn't that a function of human "doing". Without man Niagara Falls would just be water in motion being itself -- not "doing" anything -- just being what it is -- following the path of least energy -- blindly obeying the laws that govern it. Blind obedience is not "doing" -- a ball rolling down an inclined plane is not "doing" anything. Newton's Laws of motion really tell us the story of things naturally not doing anything -- things that are in motion stay in motion -- things that are at rest stay at rest -- unless some force acts upon them. And we plainly see that the forces of the universe -- gravity, explosions, eruptions, magnetism, etc are not purposive -- they just are. Mt. Helena was trying to do anything, it was just being a volcano, right?<br>  <br>  So, it's more truthful to say that almost everything that nature shows us (I avoid saying "does") is in vain. The appearances that Nature, per se, presents, are, in the main, non-purposive. <br>  <br>  Religionists whose obsessive neurosis always takes them to a Creator want to see and find purposes in Nature, like a man in the desert wants to see and find water. But mirages are not the stuff of true philosophy -- only truth is the "right stuff" for the man or woman seeking wisdom.
8379c575798db3493c5c0194efc05e70aa	I am really not sure whether there indeed is any 'universal' meaning to life in general or human life in particular. I believe life gets meaningful only in an individual context driven by the values subscribed to by the individual concerned. It is of course religion that attempts to provide some universal meaning by standardizing a set of values amongst its followers.|`|d04ae6ff8e12fe20d1db30d24b4bc806aa	No, you don't need to be religious. In fact, in my opinion, religion more often than not gets in the way of finding a universal meaning. Please let me explain...<br>  <br>  Religion tends to force one into a rather narrow set of doctrinaire beliefs. Religion narrows the range of perspective we have. It gives us a label (Christian, Muslim, Jew, whatever).<br>  <br>  This tends to devolve into an "Us vs, Them" mentality that you can easily see if you spend any time at all on these pages.<br>  <br>  I've always maintained that religions represent one set of perspectives that force us to exclude every other perspective. I don't wish to be limited, labeled or squeezed into someone else's little doctrinaire box. I'd rather attempt to see things in a more universal way.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.

The one who knows the function of each part is the Creator. <br>  <br>  Religious does not show you who God is.

At the same time, the mystery of our existence deepens.<br>   In the middle ages, it was heretical to believe and espouse the notion that the sun, and not the Earth, was the centre of what we now call our solar system. Astronomers whose empirical observations and logic told them otherwise were excommunicated and imprisoned for speaking the truth. Likewise for early (and not so early) advocates for the theory of evolution.<br>   I find profound spirituality in nature and, by extension, in the cosmos. For eons, our human ancestors gazed in awe at the night sky. Daytime events such as eclipses and the daily rebirth of the life-giving sun also amazed them. The belief systems of many cultures were based on what its people observed in the sky and the natural world around them, and how they interpreted that. In other words, it gave meaning to their lives.<br>    As we increasingly see our tiny world as a mere speck in the vast universe, we can also wonder at the miraculous synchronicity of so many variables, which has given us a vibrant planet to call home. Mysterious, but meaningful.<br>   - P.|`|4IZv07D6aa	No is the short answer. The cosmos everything taken as is precluding any ideas we may have ourselves about its nature.

Our task must be to free ourselves from the prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty. The true value of a human being is determined by the measure and the sense in which they have obtained liberation from the self.

dsqm0x9Waa	the trick to dancing with high heels is getting used to the feeling of the balence. when you dance with high heels. you want to start out with 2 inch high heels and practice dancing with those for about 2 months once you thing that you have enough balence then you can start switching to 1 or 3 inch high heels. so what i want you to do now is when ever you dance wear the 1 or 3 inch pair of high heels for 2 weeks but only wear them when you dance and then wear the 2 inch high heels for about two weeks but only when your dancing. continue to do this process for about 3 monthes. and by then you can pretty much know how to dance with high heels on. hope i helped!

LySa1skpaa	I'm in the same boat as you because I too am deciding on whether to self publish my book, or go with a mainstream publisher as I too am a first time author.Here is my advice from what I've been researching over the past couple of weeks. Self publishing is easier than mainstream, because anyone can self publish. Mainstream, first you have to find an agent, they have to review your work, then edit it, they submit it to possibly publishers.If the book is finally released you end up having to pay the agent,promotional people and owe money to the publisher, and the book many not sell millions, so u would be inmainstream bookstores, but end up making less money. Plus fewer than 5% of books submitted to mainstream publishers actually get published.<br>     As for self publishing you basically have to do everything, and the success of the book depends on how well you can market the book, and the connections that you make.But you have more control, and take in more money. So publicity= mainstream, profit= self publishing<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a0a4b271882587e60ffff0e04ab06fb3aa	Self publishing will give any first time author a bit of exposure but not much else. Amazon's KINDLE is one way to get your name out there. If you're serious about getting published, here's my suggestion.<br>  <br>  Once you've finished your manuscript, invest $20 a month for about 3 months at Publishers Marketplace. Your PM page describes you, your books and what you're looking for, including cover art and other graphics. Lots of agents and publisher reps read those PM pages looking for gems they've not heard about yet. I've gotten movie inquiries and other requests that way.<br>  <br>  Once you actually get an agent who wants to read your material, write a knock out query letter and mail it off with "Requested Material" on the envelope. That's far better than sending query letters to people who may or may not care what you've written. This whole process takes longer but in the end is far better than self publishing.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Jon Baxley<br>  Fantasy Author of:<br>  THE SCYTHIAN STONE<br>  THE BLACKGLOOM BOUNTY|`|AVYBazOEaa	mainstream.|`|AA11485682	If you can get published by an established publisher, do so. It's a much better choice. You get professionals with connections who will be working to get your book sold. The consequence is that you have lots of competition, and that they get a share of the money.<br>  <br>  Self Publishing is only starting to become respectable. Because anyone can do it, there's a feel that self published books are usually of poor quality. But if you can make it work, it can make you money.<br>  <br>  But try established publishers first.
LySa1skpaa	mainstream any amount of time, but usually a minimum of 1 year, due to the fact of constant editting. mainstream publishers if they are interested in your work, will not publish the first or second draft. but it's a possibility they will not accept or publish your book at all.<br>  <br>  Self publishing, about a month from when you submit the work.It's a lot less time, because self publishers don't edit your work so they will publish whatever draft you send to them, as long as you pay in full.

P3kIkuyVaa	They were actually rounded up by their own countrymen and sold. They were not caught!|`|NYU37jfGaa	It would depend very much what tribe they came from.  A lot of Africans were hunter gatherers, the men would hunt for meat, the women would gather fruit, vegetables, nuts etc. Africa has a wide variety of animals, and the men would probably hunt various kinds of deer, like antelope, impala, etc, and there would be leopards and things, and larger animals like lions, elephants and giraffes, though I don't know how common it was for people to hunt the bigger animals.  Probably it would be quite dangerous to try and hunt down an elephant for instance.<br>  <br>   Other tribes had developed agriculture and would lead a more settled existence, farming the land.  In many agricultural societies, it is women who do the farming, while men hunt. They would have domesticated animals like pigs and cows.  If they lived in a community large enoug to have a market, they might take their surplus products to the market to sell. The women would be responsible for cooking the food as well as growing most of it, and they would do spinning and weaving to produce the cloth to make clothing.<br>  <br>  Many African societies herd cattle as their main form of livelihood.  The cattle provide many of their needs, for meat,  milk, leather etc.  A person's wealth is judged by how many head of cattle they own.<br>  <br>  It would very much depend on which tribe the slaves came from as to which form of life they were used to, hunter-gathering, herding or farming.  Those who came from farming societies might be best adapted to the work they would be expected to do as slaves, though since farming is or was regarded as women's work in much of Africa, there might have been problems with men not wanting to do the work. But I suppose they would quickly be persuaded once they got to the colonies.|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	the style of life would depend on the tribe. SOme tribes are cattle herders by tradition (Luo, Masai, Tutsi, Ndebele ,Zulu) others are farmers (eg. Hutu, Shona, Kikuyu) and still others are mostly fishermen (eg. parts of the Ngoni and Buganda tribes). This is the style of life considered "proper" for the men of the tribe. <br>  <br>  In day to day lives they would simply work, some would be ironsmiths, others would produce food, others would make pottery or boats or zaribas or any other thing which was needed in the village. Some would train for war (raiding was definetly part of the life style in Africa, and still remains so today) and still others would go off to seek employment in larger townships- eg. Arab trade posts (buying ivory, gold, animal skins and slaves).<br>  <br>  As to hunting- everything that walks is edible. The general name for "wild life" is "nyama" which simply means "meat". BTW. contrary to "common knowledge" there was pracically no cannibalism in Africa (definetly less than among the Celts, Germans or Slavs) and practically only one tribe (Simba in Congo) ever practiced it<br>  <br>  Once in a while came the slave raids- either as a part of a inter-tribal conflict or as a spin-off from a larger war (eg the Mahdi used the slave trade to finance his wars against Egypt and Ethiopia) if that happened it was a complete disaster because the raiders would be much better armed, organised and led by local hired guides. Moreover they were interested not in single people (like the traditional "wife raids"- which are more of a game) but every able bodied person from the tribe (they would have to walk back to the slave market or die trying) and killed every "useless" person (children and old people). <br>  <br>  Even if someone managed to escape such a raid they were doomed- alone and without a tribe to protect them they would either die of hunger or be killed by the neighbouring tribes. Apart of the tribe there was no other organisation- no law or custom or authority which would protect the weak.<br>  <br>  This also meant that any captured person could not escape- he would be in the lands of a foreign tribe and therefore automatically be hunted down.<br>  <br>  One of the results were the lands "cleansed" by slave raids- eg the so called "Swahili" culture which is a graft of Arab language and customs on the remnants of Bantu tribes on the East coast of Africa, or the so called "Arab" part of the Sudan- permanently colonised by the descendants of the Arab slave traders and their Christian Sudanese victims|`|OKPFeBtYaa	Sadly, you are all right.  Slaves were often POW's of the wars between the tiny African kingdoms on the west coast of Africa.  They were traded to Europeans for tobacco and muskets.  So I do imagine life was a little similar to the way it is now in Africa, but it was probably easier in those times, as there were fewer western weapons around.  Nowadays, armies can get ahold of landmines, tanks, and AK-47's with relative ease.  In those days, I think there was plenty of warfare, but it wasn't necessarily as bloody as today.  Also there wan't anything like AIDS then either.<br>  <br>  As for food, this is from wikipedia:<br>  <br>  Thus, in essence, the local cuisine and recipes of West Africa continue to remain deeply entrenched in the local customs and traditions, with ingredients like rice, Bambara and Hausa groundnuts, black-eyed beans, brown beans, and root vegetables such as yams, cocoyams, sweet potatoes, and cassava. Cooking is done in multiple ways: roasting, baking, boiling, Frying, mashing, and spicing. A range of sweets and savories are also prepared. Plantains, peppers and green peas, citrus fruits, and pineapples, are legacy of slave ship traffic between Africa and the New World and Asia.<br>  <br>  Cooking techniques of West Africa often combine fish and meat, including dried fish. Flaked and dried, fish is often fried in oil, and sometimes cooked in sauce made up with hot peppers, onions and tomatoes various spices (such as sumbala) and water to prepare a highly flavored stew. In some areas, beef and mutton are preferred, and goat meat is the dominant red meat. It is common to have a preponderance of seafood and the seafood, as earlier stated, is sometimes also mixed with other meat products. Eggs and chickens are also preferred.<br>  <br>  As far as beverages, water has a very strong ritual significance in many West African nations (particularly in dry areas) and water is often the first thing an African host will offer his/her guest. Palm wine is also a common beverage made from the fermented sap of various types of palm trees and is usually sold in sweet (less-fermented, retaining more of the sap's sugar) or sour (fermented longer, making it stronger and less sweet) varieties.<br>  <br>  In coastal western africa, Christianity is the main religion, while away from the coast, Islam is prevalent.  But I'm not really sure from when.  A lot of the slave trade happened in the 1500/1600's.  Probably the coastal people had more native, traditional religions before being colonized by the Europeans (19th century)|`|AmKbvgmwaa	who are you asking about the slave people or the people before which was in your original question,<br>  there were in our ancient times the roman era in Africa a lot of trade in animals for food and for use in the arenas it was a massive industry <br>  later on in the pre roots era it would have been a few species less as some were hunted to extinction trible fighting went on not sure if prisoners or slaves were kept as they would have to feed them and that would depend on the tribes status and environment you must remember that Africa is a massive continent one bit can be like the U.K. raining and green and the other end like Spain, hot and rocky,  quick example|`|7KcVSB3Uaa	Read the first half of Roots.

PTdy6TWRaa	I've used Photoshop since the beginning and always thought whatever version I was working with was just fine and did the job.

Before that Photoshop didn't have layers so it made the work flow much slower.|`|AA12339318	"Good" is a relative term.<br>  <br>  However, I agree that Photoshop 3.0, with the first layers feature was an outstanding development in digital graphic design.  I can say that anything that is currently done in the field was possible with even earlier programs, only it was much more difficult and extremely time consuming.  Let's say the having layers cut that time and effort by more than half.<br>  <br>  Versions, since then, offered more tweaking, additional filters, finer color and image controls and so on, many of these useful only to the pros who know how to use them.

Use the LDK consistently and you will start to comprehend the method.<br>  Life Decryption Key<br>  Short Version<br>  By Generalist 02-09<br>  <br>   Life often looks like a secret puzzle or an encrypted message, especially when we are facing problems. We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first is to decide if we want to control our lives, or want to rely on an outside force. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?”<br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed so succinctly in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life and exclude nothing. <br>  <br>  This formulation, used with focused intention, serves as a life decryption key to enable anyone to see the relationships that exist between good concepts and harmful ones<br>  The way to use it is to add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This is spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together to close the energy circle and focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.<br>  <br>  Since we each have our unique paths and desires, there is no prescription for what people should focus on when they use the tool.  It is all available. The human mind has vast possibilities to explore once we resolve the confusion. There is no intent to move anyone to think in a certain way. There is definite intention to help human beings to think more effectively in ways that improve their individual and collective lives.<br>  <br>  Source:<br>  <a href="http://www.sgi-usa.org." rel="nofollow">http://www.sgi-usa.org.</a> Or<br>  <a href="http://www.SGI.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.SGI.org</a> <br>   Caveat; SGI does not use the term life decryption key.

qDSvOOwBaa	Without a doubt unfortunately,some of this is true. Shaved hair,for instance, was used to make felt to line the boots of U-boat personnel. In all my years of studying the Reich examples of such needless atrocity are for the most part the exception rather than the rule.<br>  <br>  I would suggest some perspective.  <br>  <br>  The Reich doctors who precipitated in some of the worst experiments disappeared-the ones who were doing mind control with such new substances as LSD that was invented by a Swiss chemist in 1938.<br>  The files of their work were taken to America and the work continued under the OSS-later the CIA. This very work started by the Nazi doctors was used for the mind control experiments done on unsuspecting American citizens by the CIA in the 50's and 60's.<br>  Also, the horrid experiments on young black males in the south using syphilis bacteria were also a continuation of the Nazi doctors work. <br>  <br>  On January 29th 1863 in The Bear River Massacre 60 female members of Shoshoni tribe were scalped alive and hung upside down to see which would die first.<br>  <br>  My point here is yes, without a doubt, the Nazi regime did horrible things.

It's hard to combine multiple personality traits into one girl, but Stephenie manages to show quite a few traits in Bella at different times. Also, we have Alice and Rosalie, Emse and Victoria...All those females in it, even in the end, Bella was stronger and more powerful than Edward.<br>  Edward, I agree with you is a little too emotional. That, of course, is explained because of his years of existence and his love being stronger than a humans.<br>  Jake's awesome, though. What teeanged boy ISN'T a sex hound? lol.<br>  Either way, it's a fantasy book. It's meant to make you feel good. There's no logic, because vampires and werewolves don't exist. There shouldn't be any political views on it either. It's just a feel good book, to make you smile...That is, if you're into that type of genre.|`|RoLcpujNaa	u right in every accord, but:<br>  i think talent has nothing to do with:<br>  the intellectual level of the author, the orientation or the depth of the characters, etc. <br>  i have no doubt whether S.M is talented or not - she is. 'cause i also read her books and while aware of the obvious shortcomings of her work (there are much more than u listed), still i couldn't quit reading till i finished all of them.<br>  <br>  people respond to her work : either love or hate it, and this too an indicator of her talent :)<br>  <br>  and though 'mushy' is an understatement for her series, i still didn't regret that i read them.|`|ajeMVARraa	People like Twilight because they like to see themselves as Bella: An average girl who finds the boy of her dreams that happens to be a vampire. It's a fantasy romance story and the demographic that it's aimed toward has raging hormones. <br>  In all honesty, it's a crap book.

I’ve read many horrid books in my day, and Twilight most certainly isn’t the worst. It is pointless arguing about why Twilight is popular because the sheer fact of the matter is that it is. And the fact that it is means that it obviously appeals to people on different levels. While your point of view may see Bella as a Mary Sue (an analysis I agree with), Edward as emotionally abusive (while I do think this sums up his personality in the first two books, he definitely grew as a character) and Jacob as sexually abusive (I don’t really like him enough to offer a defense, even if I don’t completely agree), other people’s minds perceive the characters in a very different way. And just because you don’t like the books and cannot understand their popularity, the sheer fact is that the popularity is there. And, seeing as I know a few intelligent Twilighters who still find the material wonderfully engaging, Stephanie Meyer must be doing something right. Deal with it, don’t whine, and just move onto a book you like instead of ragging on someone else’s work.|`|dNGqKZQQaa	Twilight sucks<br>  <br>  The simple language was killing me when I was reading Twilight. All my friends were in love with it, and when I finally got hold of the book from the library, I said to myself that it would probably be good since everyone was like, in love with it.<br>  The book was killing me. I mean, I kept on falling asleep. And I'm not exaggerating or anything.<br>  <br>  As for Harry Potter, I have all 7 audiobooks on my iPod and whenever I get bored I listen to them. I've listened to all 7 books at least 4 times each over the past 2-3 years.<br>  <br>  So overall, I think Harry Potter's amazing. It's epic, it's for all ages, and it's not repetitive.<br>  Harry Potter's a classic while Twilight's just a jumble of trash with not a single drop of real literature.<br>  <br>  Peace -I'm 13|`|prjXvpL8aa	It is a book with a lot of twist and turns.

Nothing really changes ever, only the way we think about it.|`|spYpsixUaa	Enticing people to wage war has historically been a disastrous piece of advice.

fnXN6cKSaa	He saw all the unfairness around him, and how the working people were oppressed and kept down.  So he came up with Communism, from commune, community, everyone working for each other, and everyone getting a fair share.  Unfortunately, humans don't work that way.  Lovely idea, but completely impractical, as proven by every single country that tried Communism.  Without exception!  The sensible countries abandoned it (Russia, China, Vietnam) but there are still some hanging on grimly, while the people suffer (N.Korea, Cuba)

muD7o37iaa	i, personally, as a skier, think this would be an AWESOME movie if you really got the comedy/romance in it close to perfect.  i like the idea!  i can totally imagine like, the cool snowboarding scenes, him 'showing the californian girl' how to ski but falling down, and just her falling for him.<br>  <br>  i would suggest to maybe make the character a smidge younger, maybe 26-29?<br>  <br>  but i totally think you've got something here for a great movie.  personally, i read a book about snowboarding once, and i didnt like it because even though i could picutre stuff, it isnt the same magic you get when you watch the board soar through the air.<br>  <br>  i wouldnt suggest you write this unless you have WICKED description skill.  or else the book could be dry, when really, it doesnt have to be!|`|RrB51Mq4aa	I'm sorry but you need to be less vague, it's a comedy and lots of funny stuff happens is like me asking if people like my story idea of a horror film but just mentioning that 'scary stuff happens' or a thriller where 'thrilling stuff happens' I'm not purposely being mean but you are trying to pith something to us, write some of that funny dialogue etc that will make the film funny and then post for critique.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps
lErNxNWVaa	It's a good book.  It stays with you a long time after you've finished it.  This is an interesting quote, a play with words.  The book has many undercurrent themes of God.  There are elements of faith and believeing all the way through.  To say there is no god, is easy to believe, considering the conditions that exist.  <br>  <br>  My husband and I are arguing over this as I type.  <br>  <br>  I say - there is no god.  To be a prophet of nothing, means you spread what word exactly?  There is no word left to spread.<br>  <br>  My husband suggests that prophets spread the word, whether god, Jehovah, Allah, or whomever actually exists. So perhaps God doesn't exist, but those who are left, the people in this book, are still his prophets in a sense and will still spread his word.  This fits with the overall sense of hope that runs throughout the book.

You have no control over what others choose to believe and who wants to spend the rest of their life convincing people who aren't willing to see who you are versus what you might happen to look like.<br>  <br>  Even the characterist and the response that you're getting, you change some of your appearance if it you let it get to you that much.

Play up your good points, as I know they are there. Be honest but make it about something other than yourself. I am always up for a good conversation and some intelligence, which you seem to possess. You aren't going to be happy if you aren't happy with yourself. Be yourself and learn to love yourself, no matter what your short comings. Make a list of positive things and people in your life. You will see what positive means even if you think it doesn't apply to you. Look around at people. Some skinny and attractive men like big and not so attractive women and vice-versa. There is always something attractive about someone, you just need to find it. I can tell you that when you are negative about yourself, you will draw in negative people. You don't need that. Find your inner strengths and work on people skills. I just know there are good things coming from you, that you don't see.<br>  I. for one, like the shaved hair for whatever reason. If this is your pic on your avatar, you are far from ugly. I know that if I met you, I would find the good in you and tell you. The question is, are you going to believe me when I am telling you the truth?<br>  I am always true to myself and others and have lost people being honest but if they can't take constructive honesty, then they will walk away and nothing ventured, nothing gained.<br>  BTW: God doesn't make no junk.<br>  Also, I am dying but still living life. I live in poverty out of circumstances beyond my control. I had to junk my car and I am 60 now but still young in mind. My body has betrayed me but I can either live within my limits or give up. I choose life even though I don't see many people at all. Does it hurt? yes. but it could be worst and I believe in God. I put my burdens on Him to help me get through. I will go when He wants me too.|`|NCt6VrLLaa	Don't seriously its perfectly fine being yourself. Trying to put up a front will only make your life more miserable. You will have t maintain that front and after a while realise that no one around you actually truely know who you are. <br>  <br>  It will help short term but will make you feel horrid and lousy long term and the last thing we want is someone jumping off a building again.|`|kRJ7Liu4aa	Yes|`|52117dcb7416ab916ef6426b49b50ab6aa	Your question is very interesting.  Let me try to answer it first by saying yes..to me it can be exhausting to behave a way that doesn't match on the inside.  I know exactly how that feels.  I am a black woman and I am well spoken and I have all my Afrocentric features.wide nose, dark skin etc.  I have been teased all my life mostly people saying I am a white girl trapped in a black girl body.  And my natural demeanor is a professional one, that tends to hurt me socially cause I don't like doing off the wall things like partying hard.  This has been the story of my life.  I lost me job 6 months ago for doing the right thing and alerting my boss to something that was going on.  She in turn saw me as a problem and pushed me out the door.  In part of because I was the messager and the girl I reported wa a light skinned girl who was everybody favorite. So do you see where I am going with this.  I am expected to be a ghetto freak cause I am dark skinned with curves even though I am no where close to that.  Everytime I open my mouth to speak, all eyes are on me, and in a negative way cause I am expected to speak ebonics and I do not.  I am told that I think I am better than people, or I wanna be white (not true)  Everything I would consider positive about me are viewed negatively by society.  I am honest and postive and love to help other people and I don't gossip about people short comings I try to help...that sort of thing.|`|GPkcg8Rqaa	I think it depends to what extent you put thought into it. I used to hate myself and my body but it only took the love of one person to make me realize that someone can love me anyway...and the ones that have a problem with who I am or don't see the beauty in me are not people I need in my life anyway.<br>  Maybe I have a "childlike mind" (I am a preschool teacher!) but I really don't think how someone looks changes my opinion of them...how they look can definetly change their opinion of themselves though.  It also depends on what you are expecting from the people you are "lying to". People who aren't "hot" can still have tons of friends even if they don't pretend to be someone they're not.  <br>  People who have far worse problems than yours still find love.  People with birth defects or who've had terrible accidents that have disfigured their face...<br>  <br>  Update to your next question: instead of pretending do exactly what you said...if you are in a bad mood don't plaster on a fake smile...I have a chronic condition that is very painful (but from the outside I look totally normal) and when someone asks me how I am I tell them "not good".  I HATE when people tell me to smile because I'm prettier when I smile...I'll smile when I'm happy, right?<br>  <br>  Update to your comment:  I still think you are discussing how other perceive you...such as when you say" "People expect me to be someone who is the exact opposite of who I really am because of my appearance, and when I have told them otherwise, they have generally been rude and dismissive."  <br>  But if someone telling you they are attracted to you physically and for your personality doesn't change how you feel about yourself then yes you are causing damage to yourself...because focusing so much on this part of yourself is pretty egocentric and that is never a good thing.|`|OKPFeBtYaa	The psychologically damaging part is that you put so much stock into how you look.  You are comparing yourself to 1)you in the past or 2) someone else?  Either way, that isn't healthy. I certainly agree that being fake all the time is bad, but if your true self is always moping about your physical appearance, you should try to fix your true self.  <br>  <br>  <br>   "It doesn't matter what you look like if you're beautiful inside", etc., which are mostly designed for children, or people with unquestioning, childlike minds.<br>  <br>  And no, I don't think you are beautiful inside, because you seem to be quite superficial, especially if you judge others the way you judge yourself.  You say you're too smart to believe those kind of cliched, pop psychology truisms.  OK.  But you're not smart enough to see the black and white predicament you've painted for yourself.  You seem to be saying, I can be fake happy, or keep it real by being sad.  <br>  Why not just be happy for real?<br>  <br>  Let me add this:  From a rational point of view, if you worry or ruminate about your height, will you have a growth spurt?  No.  Then why worry?  You should always be true to your individuality, but being true to your insecurity is different.  You have strong points.  Cultivate them.|`|XxHVjB3Naa	i think it would be. i heard that the multiple personality disorder comes from people who have to act differently with different people. like a kid with divorced parents, one telling them they are bad all the time, and the other one telling them they are good, the poor kid gets confused and has to act differently with different people, and ends up losing thier original identity, and taking on multiple others.|`|fnXN6cKSaa	I always see myself as this good looking guy with a sharp, incisive and generally terrific sense of humour.

I'm extremely modest as well, by the way.   So I'm just going to accept the way people see me, and live with it and make the most of it.|`|ThYtk2OUaa	Be true to yourself and the rest comes naturally|`|QKkytwwjaa	Yes, it does hurt, real bad actually.<br>  <br>  1st off, I'm not an expert or professional in psyciatrist  or psychology stuff, but 2nd, I will tell you what I know from my own personal experience and what I know from other sources<br>  <br>  I'll be real honest. I had been bullied for so many times before. It hurts, but I just feel that I can't tell my family or someone who is close to me like family about it. I've also been hurt in so many other ways, like back-stabbed, lied, cheated, etc by other people, which makes me become more mature than many people in my age, but my good nature keeps me on keep believing other people so easily... ;( which is bad...<br>  <br>  Anyway, so from my own personal experience, I learn on how to make friends with other people, how to be liked by others, even if that means I have to put up a mask on my real face and be another person. It usually hurts, but it usually works!<br>  <br>  Possitive & negative effects on me:<br>  <br>  - Become another person make me feel really guilty sometimes,<br>  <br>  + but sometimes, it makes me understand that other person better, by trying to see stuff from their point of view.<br>  <br>  - Sometimes it makes me think on how sad and bad my life is, which at times results in me being less confident in myself and a bit depressed.<br>  <br>  + Sometimes I think more before I act or say something, trying to guess on how the other person would react, whether it'll be good or not, or better or worse for our relationship.<br>  <br>  - People think about me in different ways. They think I'm this other person, who I am not. They think they know me, but they don't.<br>  <br>  + I have more 'friends' than I would probably have if I acted as my true self.<br>  <br>  - Sometimes I say "Noone really knows me" (or the real me), which makes myself sad, but at times it is the truth. Because sometimes I never really let other people to know the real me, I act and say things to make them happy, to make them likely me more and more.<br>  <br>  + I become better in acting.<br>  <br>  - When I'm with 2 different people (or 2 different groups of people), it becomes kind of hard at times. Because 1 side would wants me to say or act something, which is probably the opposite of the what the other side wants me to say or act. It's harder when I have actually been putting on different masks to each group or people, because if I say or act something different, then they that I have changed and they might put on a distance in our relationship.<br>  <br>  - Sometimes it makes me feel like I can't trust almost anyone.<br>  <br>  + Sometimes, I can tell whether other people had actually been putting on a mask as well<br>  <br>  - Sometimes, I become too caution or way too caution that the people around me have actually also been doing the same thing as well. Makes it harder for me to believe in other people<br>  <br>  + Sometimes, I become caution enough in a healthy amount that the people around me have actually also been doing the same thing as well.<br>  <br>  + & - What sometimes I do when I get to know more of a person, or closer to them, I try to put off my mask a tiny bit by bit. Sometimes they can disagree or don't like my real face, if that the case, then I'll be putting the mask on again, but if they actually kind of like or really like my real face, then I would usually keep on continuing putting my mask off my real face bit by bit. (May be this is what you can do, because I've been doing this as well ;) and it works sometimes).<br>  <br>  The possitive & negative of doing this:<br>  + I know the person's personality more, and so I can guess whether I like them or not before I give too much personal information to them.<br>  + If I'm in the person's good side already, even if I don't really like them, they still can be friends-for-benefits. Even though I know that this is bad and I don't really like people who is doing this, I still do it at times.<br>  - By having friends-for-benefits, I feel real guilty sometimes,<br>  + but in other times, I feel that I'm just simply clever enough that I can do this (I think not everyone can actually do this) -I know I'm evil occasionally-<br>  <br>  I'm so sorry if this getting too long.<br>  But I really want to give you any help that I think is possible or I know of, because I'm aware that I've been doing this sometimes for at least 2 years (also before these past 2 years, but just not as often as these past 2 years).<br>  I don't know whether this helps or not, but I hope it does.<br>  Wish you all the best in every way that possible!<br>  <br>  EDIT: When I'm not happy, I usually try to remember some happy or funny memories. Sometimes it works! But in other times they just make me more unhappy, because I might remember my current situation and wanting the situation to change.<br>  What I also heard is something like this: Try to stop wanting or desiring (something that's the opposite of what is happening or what you actually have) and try to accept the reality more. I think that this 1 is pretty hard though. But if someone 100% succeed in doing this, then that one person can endure the pain or unhappiness.

There was already rampant recession in germany when the great depression of 1929 made an intolerable situation even worse. Th Nazis had ready listeners for promises of jobs and improvement. They did build the most amazing network of roads in germany itself for a people who were incapable of getting motor cars then. But it was all in preparation for war and swift military transfers. The Weimar Republic fell because it held out no hope but more of the same drudgery. Better that than the horrors of war we might easy say in retrospect. But war came tacked on the end when anybody who spoke out was immediately dispatched, never to come back.|`|vhlORK4Waa	Looks like a homework question - ah well I am feeling kind toda<br>  <br>  Here's a timeline - if you want an essay you can muck about with this, but your own words would be better.<br>  <br>  1929  Germany is ruled by a grand coalition stretching from the Social Democrats to the Peoples Party and the Social Democrat Muller is Chancelor. Unemployment is rising and the unemployment insurance is in heavy deficit, and this is directly blamed on the Treaty of Versailles and the (from the German point of view) unfair terms thereof, which placed heavy penalties on Germany following WWI.<br>  <br>  The Social Democrats want to increase employer's contributions while the People's Party want to cut benefits. A compromise is patched together.<br>  <br>  1930   Rising unemployment puts the unemployment insurance into greater crisis. Meyer of the Democrats and Bruning of the Centre Party propose a new compromise. Three of the four Social Democrat Ministers accept the compromise but the Social Democrat group in the Reichstag rejects it. On 27th March Muller resigns as Chancellor.<br>  <br>  30th March Bruning forms a minority government. By including a program of agricultural support he gets the National Party to vote for the government - against the wishes of the National Party leader, Hugenberg.<br>  <br>  July Bruning's government proposes a finance package in response to the growing economic crisis. The Nationalists are divided but mainly against. Bruning needs Social Democrat support and the Social Democrat offers this on condition of changes. Bruning rejects the compromise and the measure is defeated. Bruning then goes to the President, the conservative Hindenburg, and imposes the finance reforms by emergency decree under Article 48. Article 48, intended to be used only in times when security and public order were seriously disrupted or imperilled (but this was never defined) gave the President far reaching powers. The Social Democrats move suspension of the decree which passes. Bruning asks the President to dissolve the Reichstag.<br>  <br>  14th September. Elections are held while unemployment is around 3 million. The Nazis make sweeping gains and smaller gains are made by the Communists. To form a new coalition now would need everyone from the Social Democrats to the right wing 'splinter' parties. Bruning knowing he can rely on Article 48 dosn't even try. From now on Germany ceases to be a parliamentary regime but Presidential regime ruling through the Chancellor appointed by the President. Bruning now imposes a policy of deflation which the Social Democrats reluctantly 'tolerate' by voting against motions suspending the decrees. Unemployment continues to rise.<br>  <br>  March/April 1932: Hindenburg's term expires. Bruning persuades him to stand again. The Social Democrats and the Democrats support him as the lesser evil and he is elected on the second ballot - but Hitler gains 37%.<br>  <br>  13th April: In response to growing NAZI violence Bruning's government persuades Hindenburg (very reluctantly) to ban the SA.<br>  <br>  June 1932: Hindenburg fed up with issuing unpopular decrees on Bruning's behalf replaces him by von Papen. Papen, reactionary, stupid and arrogant, was however an officer and fine horseman and so the ideal Chancellor in the eyes of the ageing President.<br>  <br>  Papen meets Hitler and Hitler hints that the Nazis might support the new government in exchange for lifting of the ban on the SA and new elections. Papen falls for it and the Reichstag is dissolved (4th June).<br>  <br>  20th July Presidential rule is imposed on the Prussian Land - using SA-communist clashes as a pretext. This gives the Chancellor direct control of the police force of 2/3rds of Germany. <br>  <br>  31st July Elections to the Reichstag. Hitler makes sweeping gains. The Nazis, along with the communists have a blocking majority in the Reichstag and as Hitler breaks his promise to support Papen once again Germany is ruled by emergency decree.<br>  <br>  12th September The new Reichstag meets. The communists move to repeal one of the emergency decrees and to no-confidence the government. Papen, to forestall this, attempts to immediately dissolve the Reichstag but not before the vote is counted - 512-42 against the government. The new elections show some losses for Hitler but gains by the communists keep the Reichstag deadlocked.<br>  <br>  By now Germany is already a Presidential dictatorship in which any attempt to oppose the emergency decrees by the Reichstag will be met by dissolution. However Papen loses the support of his cabinet and Hindenburg reluctantly agrees to Papen's resignation.<br>  <br>  2 Dec 1932: Schleicher, former friend of Papen and former minister heads the new government. Papen then , driven by a desire for revenge, seeks out Hitler. Hitler demands the Chancelorship, the Ministry of Interior, and Commissioner for Prussia. Papen wants to be Prussian Commissioner himself but offers the Interior Ministry of Prussia. As this is what Hitler really wanted he agrees and all that is required now is to get the consent of the vir|`|GxJL9UjVaa	Weimar Germany 1918-1923: Creation and Crisis <br>  <br>  <br>  The Weimar Republic was set up in the aftermath of Germany's defeat in WWI. It was burdened with the blame for the much resented Treaty of Versailles [TOV.] Although it had a new, democratic constitution creating parliamentary government, key structures in Germany were not changed in the 1918-19 German Revolution, which was very limited in scope. <br>  Between 1919-23 the Republic faced a series of revolts from the extreme Left and Right, the French (and Belgian) occupation of its key industrial heartland, the Ruhr (in 1923) and a major inflationary crisis, but managed to somehow survive. <br>  Weimar Republic 1924-1929: Years of recovery and achievement <br>  <br>  <br>  From 1924 the economy recovered and moderate parties gained more support in elections. <br>  Stresemann's conciliatory foreign policy brought Germany out of diplomatic isolation, but it aroused opposition from nationalists. <br>  Weimar Germany became famous for its cultural experimentation but this alienated many traditionalists. <br>  Weimar democracy undermined by the world economic depression <br>  <br>  <br>  Germany's economy was already suffering difficulties before 1929 and was heavily dependent on American loans, many of which could be withdrawn. <br>  From October 1929, Germany was badly hit by the effects of the Wall Street Crash. <br>  Between 1929 and 1932 production nearly halved and unemployment rose to 6 million. <br>  Governments were terrified of sparking off inflation if they spent extra money and so they took little action to counter the Depression. <br>  The slump led to growing support for extreme parties in the 1930 and 1932 elections. <br>  Germany 1929-1933: Weimar Rpublic fails and Hitler gains power <br>  <br>  <br>  After the failure of the Munich Putsch of 1923, Hitler reorganised the Nazi Party on the Fuhrerprinzip. <br>  The Nazis used skillful propaganda techniques and exploited Hitler's ability as a speaker. <br>  In 1928, The Nazis were still on the fringe of politics. <br>  in 1930, as a result of the slump, the Nazis became the second largest party. <br>  The Wall Street Crash led to a major depression, with 6 million unemployed The Depression made it harder for parliamentary government to work, and created a mood of despair. <br>  The Nazis gained particular support from the petty bourgeoisie, but were also a broadly based party, gaining support from ALL groups. For some their appeal was emotional; others were attracted for reasons of material self-interest. Others found that Hitler's public rage expressed their own frustrations and anger. The Nazis made least impact amongst groups that had a strong sense of community i.e. the Catholics and Socialists. <br>  People supported Nazi party as a result of ; dislocation of WWI [promise to disregard TOV], fear of communism, impact of Depression, <br>  In 1930, Mueller's SPD-led coalition fell; it was the last government to be based on support in the Reichstag. This can be seen as the real end to Weimar Parliamentary democracy . <br>  Extremist parties did well in the 1930 elections; in July 1932 they obtained a majority of Reichstag deputies, with the Nazis gaining 37%; success had built up momentum. <br>  After 1930 Parliamentary government declined, as a series of presidential governments, ruling largely by decree, tried to solve Germany's mounting economic and political problems. Chancellors Bruening, Papen and Schleicher had to rely on presidential decrees under Article 48 of the constitution. In January 1933, influenced by sections in the old elites, President Hindenburg reluctantly appointed Hitler Chancellor. <br>  Thus under the dual challenge of the masses who voted for radical parties and the elites who disliked democracy, the Weimar republic declined and Hitler took over. <br>  The Nazis offered a solution to Germany's problems, were well organised, and rallied around an inspiring, charismatic leader. <br>  <br>  <br>  Further Points <br>  The above is by far the best explanation I've seen on this site. <br>  <br>  <br>  Germany was deeply divided between Left and Right throughout the period. <br>  The country lacked a conventional, broadly based conservative party. (The DNVP was extreme, backward-looking and hopelessly out of touch with its traditional supporters. <br>  The old elites were wounded, angry and resentful but still there and determined to make a come-back. Since they couldn't do so on their own, they decided to try to regain their former power on the backs of the Nazis. It was an amazing miscalculation. They discovered - but too late - that it was the Nazis who used them. <br>  For most of the Weimar period, both the old and the new elites were fearful of Bolshevism. This fear was an extremely important feature of political life during the Weimar period and it was ruthlessly exploited by Hitler as the Communist vote grew in the early 1930s.|`|8qT6zj4Haa	Well after WW1 the economy was near bankruptcy.

It was not chosen by the Germans, and was destined to fail.<br>  <br>  The depression caused Germany to blame whoever was in power at the time (as is usually the case in times of crisis). The Depression happened, and since there was no one else to blame, the current sitting government took the blame.<br>  <br>  Hitler promised everything the Wiemar Republic could not, or had not been able to deliver on. He promised to overturn the Versailles Treaty (which the Wiemar Republic was bound by), to recover from the Depression (which people felt was caused by the Wiemar), and to give the German people a government elected by them, rather than imposed on them by foreign countries.

AA11779954	Here's some information on Leonardo. By the way art historians never call him da Vinci because that just means from or of Vinci and so doesn't really make sense.<br>  <br>  Oh, before I go on I must just point out that I've studied Leonardo now for may years and HE WAS NOT ahead of his time! This is a very common misconception - I actually had to reprimand an American professor who was talking to a group of students in Florence quite recently with regard to this misinformation. Although he was extremely talented and sometimes pushed the limits of what was acceptable with his art, he essentially battled to understand the problems of his time and like other thinkers of his day struggled to find solutions and looked to the Classical past in order to move forward. (You only have to read his notebooks to understand this)<br>  <br>  It is important to remember that Italy during the Renaissance was not a united country, it was a number of independent waring city states and oligarchies whi ch were all vying for power. An artist then was important to a patron for example the Medici or the Sforzas for the prestige the employment of such an artist convey and moreover the capabilites of the artist in the casting of metals. If an artist could cast a bronze statue in peace time, he could cast canon during a war. Look at Leonardo's letter to Ludovico Sforza and you will see that he tells Ludovico of his many skills which could help to establish the reputation of this relatively new duke. Unsurprisingly Leonardo add painting to the very bottom of the list.<br>  <br>  Here are a few bits of information with regard to his abilities. <br>  <br>  He was the first Renaissance artist to take up industrial design.<br>  <br>  Leonardo was an expert in hydraulics and re designed a pilot project for the design of the city of Milan and he devoted hundreds of notes and drawings to clocks, clockwork and perpetual motion.<br>  <br>  He used a hypothesis and tests much like a scientist does today and said, 'science is the captain,practice the soldier'.<br>  <br>  Being a humanist he loved the myth of Icarus and subsequently researched flight. He did not invent the helicopter! The drawing which looks like one is actually a plan for an aeriel screw which works on the principle of a helix, although he did sketch gliders, tank like troop carriers and what could be called a submarine. A great discovery of Leonardo's was that of why fossils ended up where they did and rock strata etc.<br>  <br>  Moving on to maths, Leonardo was not a great mathmatician although he did like geometry. He was friends with the mathmatician and geometrist Luca Pacioli in Milan while he worked for Ludovico Sforza. He provided the illustrations for Pacioli's famous de divina proportione. <br>  <br>  He produced aeriel maps for Cesare Borgia which are still accurate today.<br>  <br>  In anatomy, drawings like Leonardo's had never been seen before. He drew expolded diagrams, cross sections etc and his attention to detail was very accurate. He discovered the maxilliary sinus cavity and some functions of the heart. Doctors still use his anatomy drawings today and not so long back they were used to aid pioneering valve surgery.<br>  <br>  In art Leonardo invented the sfumato technique of painting.<br>  <br>  These are but a few of Leonardo's achievements but remember not to get embroiled within the myth of Leonardo. His genius lay in the extent to which he was able to study and infer causes from that study. His failings lay in the fact that he did not publish his significant findings.<br>  <br>  A further factor that was important during the Renaissance was the renewed interest in the writings of classical antiquity, Pliny the Elder's Natural History in particular which told of the artistic and personal qualities of Greek artists such as Apelles. When Vasari writes of Leonardo during the close of the Renaissance he echoes the qualities that were important in an ancient artist in his biography. Leonardo is said to be strong, intellegent, well dressed and above all good natured. These are important features in an artist of this period as Vasari, apart from writing a biographical account to artists was attempting to elevate the status of the artist from a craft worker to that of the liberal arts (Philosophy, poetry etc).<br>  <br>  Leonardo loved animals especially dogs and horses and apparently used to buy caged birds just to set them free. He was also a vegetarian which was unusual in those days.<br>  <br>  He was friends with Sandro Botticelli and was said not to get along with Michelangelo.<br>  <br>  Here's a great link for Leonardo info.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.universalleonardo.org/index.p..." rel="nofollow">http://www.universalleonardo.org/index.p...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  P.s.<br>  <br>  All this mention of Leonardo painting himself as a woman in drag for the Mona Lisa and Mary Magdalene present in The Last Supper is just unfounded assumptions which were made popular by Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	He was left-handed, and homosexual, and wanted to be a woman.

PTdy6TWRaa	A vector is a mathematical way of describing where image information should be placed so lines, geometric shapes and curves come into play rather than pixels. Fonts are an example of vector images. Since they do not depend on pixels or resolution they can be scaled without causing a loss of quality to the image. For this reason vector artwork is a good choice for creating things like logos. It's also useful for setting up art for silkscreen or machine embroidery.<br>  <br>  If you are doing this in Photoshop then you need to create "paths". The paths are vectors. Those paths can be exported in a few vector formats such as Adobe Illustrator. <br>  <br>  Photoshop isn't an ideal program for creating vector art but can work for minor jobs. If you have much vector work to do it would be better to do it in a vector art program such as Illustrator.|`|AA11287246	It's called a vector layer. There's two kinds of layers; vector and raster.

The madness of the mob and craving for this type of entertainment finally ended in the 6th century. Public events included mock naval battles, wild animal hunts and of course, gladiator fights. Mock naval battles were held by removing the wooden floor and flooding the lower floor.<br>  <br>  The Inauguration of the Colosseum.<br>  Hundred-day games were held by Titus, Vespasian's successor, to mark the inauguration of the building in AD 80. In the process, some 9,000 wild animals were slaughtered.<br>  <br>  The Colosseum was originally called the the Flavian Amphitheatre but was given the name Colosseum. The name Colosseum was taken from the Latin word 'colosseus' meaning colossal referring to a gigantic statue of the Emperor Nero, measuring 100 to 120 Roman feet (37m) high, which had once occupied the location of the Colosseum in Ancient Rome.<br>  <br>  Edit: The first ancient Olympic Games can be traced back to 776 BC and were staged on the ancient plains of Olympia in Greece (not in Rome).|`|qgs155HNaa	If you're looking for real details, the Roman poet Martial, who was present for the opening, wrote a whole book of poems on the inaugural events, which survives.|`|31420ed41c716cbb02addca8d450fc2eaa	They did a lot of things there.

Hm0bCjYFaa	I think it's nice and don't worry about what other people think. That's why poems are so great.   NO RULES|`|Yldw8nHoaa	There is something lovely in the harmony of this poem between the meaning and the melody, which reminds me the coming of the spring season and so it is hard to criticize. Yet It seems to me that in the melody you are more successful than in the meaning, because I understand that two people are happy, but I don`t understand what are the feelings that make them happy- I feel like an empty space these parts:<br>  "We laughed, we cried, we shared our thoughts and feelings"- About what?<br>  "of life and of wisdom, through which we'd decided to move together,<br>  and stay close to the heart of one another"- What is the content of life and wisdom  through which you have decided to be together?|`|cd0AdJpDaa	hi... wow thats a very good poetry. u seem a natural in writing poetry. its perfect. its both touching and contemporary at the same time.one more like this and i ll turn into your fan. keep it going.|`|XkidpdPWaa	That second line is purely annoying, 'lovey-dovey'?<br>  But the rest of it is beautiful.|`|K7dmvLKSaa	INSPIRING!!!!but i think the last stanza dosen't fit in the poem you should change it.
rkeLJ8RAaa	its o.k. but u know, u can read it if you like. Its not horrible|`|ZuWD3SVfaa	It was not until the 5th book of Harry Potter had come out that I started reading the series an old boss of mine was reading the series to her kids and lent me the first one, within a few hours of finishing the first one I went out and purchased the series up to where it was.<br>  Forget the movies as they do not follow the book closely well bar maybe the first one which was closer tot he book than the rest of them.<br>  Following the books through you see the character grow as each book relates to one year of Harry's life, so the older he gets the darker things become.|`|dNGqKZQQaa	YES Harry Potter's is as good as the Inheritance Trilogy.<br>  <br>  Personally I like Harry Potter more.<br>  But Harry Potter's amazing. The characters are similar to the ones in Eragon, Eldest, etc|`|divHOiLWaa	Harry Potter is a great series. Read it. Afterword, see the movies. I cant believe they put off HP for Twilight.

ITS A ENHANCING JOURNEY TO THE FANTASITICLAL WORLD OF WIZARDRY|`|YUudOvk1aa	There a great sett of books fo all ages!!!!! at least give them a try...you have nothing to loose!!! <br>  <br>      Barbie Xx|`|86oPkfzOaa	YES IT'S GOOD!!!!!! It's my favorite book/series. It appeals to all age ranges, not just kids, so if you are an adult/late teen then you can still read and love it! Yeah, it has action, the first 3 books not so much [but they are good too!], but the 4, 5, 6, and 7th books have more battles and things like that. Really, you should read them, they're so good!|`|X6rFPI2laa	Yes!  There is a reason that JK Rowling is second only to the Queen as  the wealthiest woman in the UK -- a large part of that is from the movies, etc., but that would never have happened if her books had not been so well-loved by people of all ages.  Enjoy!|`|yTquTHUPaa	Yes! Of course! I am a B-I-G Inheritance Series fan, and I loved every page of the book, but if it wasn't for Harry Potter I wouldn't be the avid reader I am today! Harry Potter isn't as hard to read as Eragon etc., but the plot gets better as the books go up... After the first 3, you'll never want to stop. Oh, also, if you have seen the movies, forget about what you saw because they left out practactly everything! (If you haven't seen the movies don't bother, same with eragon). Give them a try and I'm sure you'll love them =]|`|82d0ffbf5ae0da1887861c8c50de2836aa	The Harry Potter series is great. But it's not an epic journey like LOTR or the Dark Tower series or anything like that. The first two books are short and kind of stand alone. the third book is where things happen that start the rest of the story. Keep in mind that it's not set in an ancient time, it's set entirely in the present. But there are trolls, giants, dragons, three headed dogs, basilisks, giant spiders, and many more cool creatures. Whatever you do, do not base any Harry Potter opinions off of the movies.|`|8MaRk2AZaa	Yeah its great, I'm a big fan of both it and eragon, an I have to say I prefer Harry Potter! It's a must read, but don't be put off by the first two books, because they aren't as good as the rest of them, but they are the ultimate "can't put it down series", although eragon was pretty good too ;-)|`|ajeMVARraa	Heck yes it's good!

y6uKv9GOaa	i've  read an interview with jk,she said that voldemort's boggart is his own corpse-for obvious reason..|`|86oPkfzOaa	JK Rowling said somewhere that Voldemorts boggart would be his own dead body. I think it fits.|`|uq1GXvSdaa	Dumbledore<br>   it was the only one Voldemort fear.|`|ugiUyhOwaa	The boggart will probably turn into his own corpse.|`|IWaxUqDzaa	Definitely Death. More specifically Harry Potter causing his death.|`|0jlG2clBaa	some form resembling death,because that is what Voldemort used to fear the most|`|Kf9SoNmoaa	Dumbledore, or his own corpse. <br>  <br>  Or maybe even Harry.|`|XGzC67P5aa	I have to agree with many people that have answered: death is probably his greatest fear. But I do not think it is that alone. I think it would be being defeated by a wizard he thought never had the chance, and all his followers turn their backs and pretend they never had anything to do with him. Voldemort does everything he can to be immortal, and losing it would be, the worst thing in the world for him.|`|RZQHB0g8aa	Well I think the thing Voldemort fears most is death. That's why he's gone to such lenghts to make himself immortal. I don't know if a boggart can turn into death, though... It did for Mrs. Weasly in some sort but as Voldemort has no people he cares about it can't turn into dead people to portrait death. Good question by the way!|`|uZ5xTHFKaa	i think what he fears the most is death as that's why he wanted to make himself immortal, so he made the horcruxes.<br>  <br>  it also might turn into dumbledore as he is the only wizard that voldemort ever feared.|`|za9b8cHKaa	Voldemort?|`|SFxQyTfJaa	Into his mother xD|`|F1y43Wbsaa	dumbledore probably!|`|0BRnovJYaa	it turns into Harry Potter- his worst fear!|`|TZTJRrM4aa	of course, Dumbledore:<br>  The only one he feared|`|KTzQB95Eaa	harry.dumbledore..or his own dead body?!!|`|o6IPqzrJaa	I think it would turn into his dead body or make everything go dark, because Dumbledore says in the 6th book (when he and Harry or going to get the horcrux) that Voldemort fears the dark and death. Voldemort only cares about himself, he doesn't really care if someone else dies, so it would be his own body, dead.  I think JK Rowling mentioned it in an interview, she said Voldemort's boggart would be his death.|`|sUx8kdEDaa	dumbledore or harry or his his own corpse.either of the three.<br>  he was afraid of dumbledore because he knew everything about him...even his darkest secrets.<br>  he was afraid of harry because of the prophecy.one one of them could have llived.<br>  and his own death because he took such extreme steps just to make himself immortal.<br>  <br>  bytheway...its a very good question.|`|29e7B9l7aa	it might turn into something that represents him losing the "war".<br>  Or maybe Dumbledore because he was the only wizard he was ever afraid of.|`|ZuWD3SVfaa	It would be Death as that is what Voldemort fears above all including Dumbledore and why he took the steps he did to make himself immortal.<br>  Though he did fear Dumbledore it was death he was more afraid of.|`|rtyrMPcdaa	I think that the Boggart will turn into Dumbledore as he is the only whom Voldermort is most feared|`|qXREoORzaa	Harry Potter<br>  His Father?

PTdy6TWRaa	There is an in interesting tour of Egyptian art and artifacts going on right now. Perhaps this one is coming to your town or one near you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Experience The World of King Tut!<br>  "Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs" is the renowned exhibition that has drawn 5 million visitors worldwide.   Currently on view at the Dallas Museum of Art, the exhibition will continue to San Francisco's de Young Museum in June of 2009.  The exhibition was previously presented at the Los Angeles Country Museum of Contemporary Art, the Field Museum in Chicago, the Fort Lauderdale Museum of Art, and The Franklin  in Philadelphia. <br>   <br>  "Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs" explores the figures who guided ancient Egypt more than 3,000 years ago.  The exhibition focuses on the 18th Dynasty, a 100-year period when Egypt was at the height of its power and the "golden age" of Egyptian artistry.  This was the era when Tutankhamun and his ancestors reigned.  The extensive array of more than 130 extraordinary artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun and other ancient Egyptian sites features 50 of Tutankhamun's burial objects, including his royal diadem and one of the four gold and precious stone inlaid canopic coffinettes that contained his mummified internal organs.|`|ZtGEyNJVaa	The Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto has an egyptology section|`|AA12339318	San Jose, California, is home to one of the foremost collections of ancient Egyptian artifacts.

It is an extensive collection, including several actual mummies on display. (some are at least 4,000 years old)  There are tools, toys, games and plenty of household object from royal houses do those from ordinary people.  Most of these are actual, genuine items, although, a few are very good recreations, such as the bust of Nefertitti, and a full size replica of the Rosetta Stone.<br>  <br>  Various models and dioramas are set up to help place these artifact as they might have been seen at the time.<br>  <br>  Here is their site to help you with your exploration:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.egyptianmuseum.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.egyptianmuseum.org/</a>

RrB51Mq4aa	Depends whether or not your patient, if you're not wanting to self publish you will need to be willing to wait well over a year until you see your book on a shelf. Most reputable publishers will not accept unsolicited manuscripts, they accept only those that come through agents, so step up and hunt down an agent that deals with the genre of book that you have written. Writers.net has a listing of agents. It will then be their job to secure you a publishing deal, which is why you'll have to pay then 15% of the cash you earn. BUT you have to get the agent, which means a query letter with probably three chapters of your book for them to tell if your worth taking on to their books. The whole process is long and drawn out, but it is the way it is, I wish you the best of luck.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|muD7o37iaa	if you're afraid to trust people while trying to get published, get your finished product copyrighted.  its easy, official, and you can sue the hell out of anyone who takes your story.  i recently just did this, im real paranoid about sending my manuscript out.  its cheap, too!<br>  <br>  pick up a copy of the book writer's market.  it has HUNDREDS of listings for publing companys, agents, and more.  all the listings in it should be reliable, no agent/company should steal your work, they arent allowed to.  plus, if you're copyrighted you have that sueing advocate.<br>  <br>  you gotta find yourself an agent.  once you have a trustworthy one who doesnt completly scam you, he/she can publicise your book to the companies and work to get your writing on the shelves with you.<br>  <br>  you could also self-publish.  sometiems, when you do that, other companies see your book on the shelves, pick it up, and want to sign with you.  but thats not garuntee and the whole process is expensive since you're publishing your own work and everything.  you have to be willing to take a chance and cough up the dough (plus, you'd have to edit yourself or hire an editor when a company could do that for you)

uZ5xTHFKaa	the one with the power......<br>  neither can live while the other survives.<br>  <br>  it is the prophecy that was made by proffesor trelawny, that is the reason why voldemort tried to kill harry as a baby.<br>  <br>  but it could also apply to neville but voldemort chose harry|`|86oPkfzOaa	The second answer is right. The prophecy [if you are talking about Harry Potter] tells that Harry cannot live as Voldemort survives [and vice-versa] so Harry is destined to destroy Voldemort once and for all. Voldemort set out to kill Harry after one of his henchmen [won't tell you who; I don't wanna spoil it] told him part of it [the first half]. The information was incomplete, but Voldemort believed that Harry Potter, son of Lily and James Potter, was the one person who could destroy him, so he set out to kill him when he was just 1 year old. He couldn't kill him, however, because Lily Potter died to save him, which gave Harry a type of special magic. The strange thing is, though,that the prophecy might not have meant Harry at all, it could have been Neville Longbottom also. All that is explained in the fifth book. Hope it helps!|`|IWaxUqDzaa	"Neither can live, while the other survives." It means that one of them [Harry and Voldemort] Must kill the other in the end.|`|TZTJRrM4aa	"The one with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches...Born to those who have thrice defied him, born as the seventh month dies...and the Dark Lord will mark him as his equal, but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not...and either must die at the hand of the other for neither can live while the other survives...." <br>  —Prophecy made to Albus Dumbledore by Sybill Trelawney

Research Problem<br>  * Is the problem identified clearly?<br>  * Is it significant--does the researcher provide a good argument for significance?<br>  * Is it relevant to nursing/health care?<br>  <br>  3. Literature Review<br>  * Is it convincing that the author reviewed a sufficient amount of literature?<br>  * Is it balanced, presenting literature that supports and that differs from <br>  the researcher's position?<br>  * Is the review written critically (giving strengths and weaknesses of previous work)? <br>  * Is the review comprised only of primary sources?<br>  * Are references current, or a combination of current and classic?<br>  <br>  4. Theoretical Framework<br>  * Is a theoretical framework specified?<br>  * Does the framework "fit" the problem?  Include all relevant variables?<br>  * Are concepts (variables) defined clearly from a theoretical standpoint?<br>  * If no framework is provided, should there be one?  Is it difficult to understand <br>  the relationships among variables in the study without a framework to tie the <br>  pieces together?<br>  * Are results interpreted in reference to the theoretical framework?<br>  --Note:  qualitative research, descriptive studies, and physiologic studies <br>  typically will not have a theoretical framework.<br>  <br>  5. Variables<br>  * Are the variables in the study appropriate to the problem?<br>  * Are the variables relevant to nursing practice?<br>  * Are the means to measure the variables appropriate? <br>  <br>  6.

Specific?  Testable?<br>  --Note:  qualitative research and many types of descriptive studies do not involve<br>  hypotheses.  In a qualitative study the researcher may suggest hypotheses as a<br>  result of the research.<br>  <br>  7. Design (overall)<br>  * Is the design specified correctly?  What design was used?<br>  * Is the design appropriate to answer the research question?<br>  * Did the researcher attempt to control for threats to internal and external validity?<br>  <br>  8.

Data Collection<br>  * Are the instruments or other means for data collection described sufficiently?<br>  * Are reliability and validity of instruments addressed?  Are these adequate?<br>  * Are data collection methods described clearly?<br>  * Are the data collection methods appropriate?  Could the researcher have <br>  affected the results of the study in some way related to the collection of data?<br>  <br>  10.  Ethical Considerations<br>  * Does the researcher indicate that approval was obtained from appropriate review boards?<br>  * Were the rights of human subjects protected (confidentiality, freedom from coercion)?<br>  * Is there any possibility that the subjects might have felt pressured to <br>  participate or their responses influenced in some other way?<br>  <br>  11.  Data Analysis<br>  * Is the process used to analyze data clear?<br>  * Were the processes for data analysis appropriate to answer the research question?<br>  * Do the results provide an answer to the research question?<br>  * If tables are provided, are these clear and understandable?<br>  <br>  Note:  For qualitative studies, some additional items for critique include:<br>  * Does the researcher provide sufficient examples of the data (for example, passages or <br>  quotations from interviews) to support the identified results?<br>  * Does the researcher describe processes that were used to avoid biasing or influencing the <br>  data obtained and the analysis procedures used?  (Ex.  Peer review, logs, memos, "member <br>  check")<br>  <br>  12.  Discussion and Interpretation of Findings<br>  * Does the discussion "fit" with the data?

spYpsixUaa	The only cases of metamorphosis which occur in reality are the transformations which occur inside of cocoons.  Even pupal insects transform inside of their older skins and discard the old skin when the transformation is complete.  The special effects of Brundle-Fly come pretty close, and--to be honest--the psychology of Brundle-Fly come pretty to the perspective you are seeking.<br>  <br>  However, becoming a Powerpath does not require any physical change, but rather a change in demeanor and moral behavior.<br>  <br>  A Frankenstein monster is technically a Chimera made entirely of human components.  In order to "become" a Frankenstein, one must die, be sent to the morgue, have his/her body stolen by a hunchback, be dismembered by a mad scientist (quietly insane will be sufficient), and have one's most successfully preserved members installed onto a carcass composed of more than one person's other body parts.  Then electricity must be applied to the nervous system (and cardio-vascular system) so that artificial animation can occur.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	Frankenstein was the name of the scientist, not the monster.|`|fnXN6cKSaa	You don't 'metamorphize' into anything! There is no such word!  Is someone giving you a hard time in the office?   It's easy to change into an 'office powerpath' (you do like creating your own words and phrases, don't you?)  Give some people a little power, and they become like Hitler or Stalin.  Happens all the time!
kzkjbv79aa	In early 1997 Geoff Rose was peremptorily removed from the project and retired from the navy<br>  page 260, Collins Class Submarine Story, Google Books<br>  <br>  Rose would have known more about what was needed than anyone booting him off the project.<br>  So I'd say not a lot was contributed in 1997.<br>  <br>  This fuels my suspicion that the project was not supposed to be successful.

QCejFqXgaa	Blessings,   God Question....It really depends on the person, It’s different for different people. To most people to be Happy   is to think          Positive That includes being optimistic about the future, expressing gratitude for the present and the past, and everything to do with having a more positive perspective of yourself, other people and the world around you.. A sense of control over your life: There are many ways to gain control; if you have the kind of job that doesn’t offer you control over your life, then you can try to have control over other areas of your life . To some , families friends and love ones        (Relationships):  is really critical. The studies all show that the happiest people have good, fulfilling relationships. You can’t find a happy person who doesn’t have good relationships. It’s sort of a necessary condition.  ,,,,,There are a lot of researchers who hand out surveys all over the world, and they look at the levels of happiness that people report. And there are certainly lots of differences. Some of those differences could just be due to social desirability or norms, and people might use the scales differently in other cultures so they’re hard to interpret. My understanding          is that the pursuit of happiness is universal, and most people in the world want to be happy and they do report that. There are clear differences in how people define happiness , to  some  Spiritual people    they  describe happiness in a more abstract way, as something less attainable like spiritual fulfillment or a world of peace. And to others  Happiness is          fun and a good career and having money. So you see it is all about you  how you feel and what makes you  feel relax at all time. And having    people that you care about and those that appreciate you  around you most of the time will make any one life a little happier.|`|I13rHn1Waa	True happiness resides in the soul of a person.....its a fact as the happiness criteria changes as the person advances to a more and more things he wants but as we know that our desires never get finished....and it depends on the human being itself, that how to go thru his life....there r some ppl who find happiness on the small things and on the other way, there r some ppl who donot find happiness in even the big things....its how a person thinks and how contented he is from his innerself....|`|ybtOvNs7aa	yes someone else makes us more happy or sad with their words..<br>  <br>  eg,, when happy,, they say.. arey waah bahot ache,, aakhir tumne kar dikhaya...

However, the very same people could also make you sad at times. During those times, is when you need to gain control of your emotions and be optimistic about life. People who are constantly exposed to elements of pain and sadness eventually give up the control and fall into depression. So, the good things that happen in life that make us happy, are our own choice to associate them with happy feelings and they only help to keep us in control.<br>  <br>  The best extreme example I can give, is that a mass killer becomes happy killing people while a child is happy with a toy. Each have their own elements and triggers of which keeps them in control of keeping a smile on their face.|`|5WaZWeY8aa	I would say it a bit different. We ourselves can make the choice how we react, towards what we experience. This does not mean that we can force our own happiness with this, as happiness is something which usually just happens without our conscious doing as a by product when we do something meaningful . If you love other people and you contribute to their happiness this will usually make you happy although you did not intend your own happiness. <br>  But if other people in your surrounding behave mean to you, or say something bad, it is your choice how to react to it. Do you let yourself bother from it or do you detach yourself from it? You can say something positive towards a negative word from a person. This is in your hand.|`|dd1xNSGTaa	obviously their words and opinion matter for us and it are matter how we are reacting on their words or opinion or attitude.<br>  and i think your question include answer itself because any one can not control our happiness beside us.  <br>  i want to say only that how we are reacting with their attitude of our family or who are close to us.|`|0BJWUl5raa	Our happiness definitely depends upon the people surrounding us but if we are  Strong enough and mentally stable  , we can overcome it.It is difficult to neglect others' comments and reactions completely.

FvdfK0Snaa	Hi there. Well, I'm an actress and I've been lucky enough to be mostly in work since I graduated university. I didn't study theatre I studied English Literature so it was very much like starting from scratch. However, doing an unrelated subject is really helpful because you have something to fall back on in between jobs which is an inevitable part of the career. When I'm not acting I do temping work in the City, reception, data entry, PA work etc or I work in a bar. On my days off I spend that time writing to agents, casting directors, directors and other important people in the industry to invite them to upcoming shows or ask them to consider me for a show (this has some mixed results as the industry is oversaturated). I<br>  <br>  If you want to get into the recording industry I suggest you continue in your GCSEs as you are then, if you want to continue your further studies, select a variety of suitable subjects for your A-Levels that relate to the recording industry and some other sturdy/traditional subjects and then do a LOT of research about what you want to do after that. There are a host of ways to improve your skills including specific courses, I recommend 'Point Blank' in Shoreditch who do great sound engineering courses, work experience in a studio or further studies at university OR you can do something related at university and do sound production/recording in your spare time. <br>  <br>  If you mean you want to get into it as a musician that's a whole other route to take. You can study music either academically at university or take a course at somewhere that specialises in music as a skill like Guildhall. However, I must stress that most people find that they work an average of 4-8 weeks a year. In my experience I'm usually working about 9 months a year, the rest of that I fill with other work like i said at the beginning which I get because I worked hard at university. Bar work is pretty easy and doesnt require any particular background, it's good to build up a few different areas of work (retail/bar/office) so you have a few options to fall back on.

oR0inhGFaa	Have you ever been to Camden Market? My memories of the place are from 1990-1995, but its a lot different now, so I don't know if this will help you, but smell-wise, there was always a heady mixture of pot and incense and chow-chow cooking on the open street stalls, I remember buskers playing the bongos by the Lock, and each shop as you walked passed blasted a different style of music, reggae and grunge. The people there were DIFFERENT, back when you really didn't see people like that, there were punks and hippies and rastas, and I used to sit under the bridge by the Lock and people-watch, everyone was fascinating and individual. In the summer, we would sun-bath on the Lock, it was always crowded and noisy but always very friendly, you could always meet someone interesting to chat to. It's nothing like that now any more, its a tourist place now, and all the unusual people have been replaced by depressingly normal people! I wish I could go back in time.

PTdy6TWRaa	Slipware is a type of pottery. English slipware, well, then it's slipware from England. Here are some links with photos and descriptions of English Slipware.|`|9adfd40573a5f8454356f9c074106d83aa	Slipware is ceramic ware that is made by pouring a thick liquid (slip) made of lots of clay, a little water, and a touch of flocculant into a plaster mold.  The plaster sucks the water out of the layer next to it and after a few minutes the extra slip is poured out and after a few minutes more the mold is taken apart and the damp clay form stands on its own.  With some additional drying, it can be handled to clean up any seam lines and flaws, when it is then set aside to dry thoroughly for glazing and decorating.   It makes thin pottery that would be very hard to throw and complex molded forms.|`|5OH4XPaIaa	<a href="http://www.mingeikan.or.jp/english/html/slipware-england.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.mingeikan.or.jp/english/html/...</a><br>  <br>  A type of pottery :3

Take a pair of scissors and destory the thing. Now think about the situation that would occur if he posted that video on YouTube and for some reason it really took hold.<br>  <br>  One by one other people might start doing the same thing, the idea would spread through e-mail / text and perhaps if it was big enough the media itself would draw attention to it (they do pay a lot of attention to the online world and its goings on)<br>  <br>  Eventually, if everybody who saw that video did cut up their credit cards and the idea spread through out the masses then their would be total chaos. For banks and businesses anyway.<br>  <br>  The point is the internet is the most powerful tool we have as a form of communication. It allows visual, audio and written versions of ideas to be broadcast out to the world. No matter what language a person speaks or where they are from, if they have an internet connection they can see it.

HNRAJOAEaa	Step1<br>  Begin with an idea or inspiration. Inspiration may come at any time very unexpectedly. It may be a specific person, place or thing that evokes some sort of strong emotion. It may be more of an abstract idea or release of emotion. It may be a tiny thing at the right moment, such as a leaf tossing in the wind a certain way. <br>  <br>  Step2<br>  Brainstorm. Write down everything that comes to mind. Don't think much; let instinct take over. Be uninhibited in what is written down and let all feelings pour out. Remember everything can be thrown out later. <br>  <br>  Step3<br>  Think about form and begin to organize thoughts. Poetry comes in many forms, from epic poetry that has a story to dramatic poetry intended to be performed. Try them all out. One will come naturally. Maybe different poems fit different forms. Try freeverse, which has basically no restrictions at all. <br>  <br>  Step4<br>  Remember rhythm and meter. There is a difference between the two, and both are equally important in poetry. Meter is the established pattern of the poem, while rhythm refers to the sound when it is spoken. Take both into consideration while writing a poem. <br>  <br>  Step5<br>  Use a lot of descriptive words. Create imagery with words, trying to appeal to all the senses in a literal way. Use symbolism, and metaphors. For auditory interest, try alliteration; the repeating of similar sounds in a sentence or phrase. All of this adds life and interest to a poem. <br>  <br>  Step6<br>  Get outside opinions. Don't be afraid to share work with others. Learn to accept criticism and grow from it.|`|FU6Lb5vKaa	Just go with your first thoughts, and feelings. This is what I do: I close my eyes and picture the words in my head. Sometimes I don't close my eyes. Remember you don't have to rhyme for it to be good poetry. Also use metaphors and similes.

ZB9zkbxxaa	Pyramids have been built at various times and places; the best-known are those of Egypt and of Central and South America. The pyramids of ancient Egypt were royal tombs. Each contained an inner sepulchral chamber that housed the deceased (usually mummified) ruler, members of his entourage, and artifacts. The rest of the pyramid complex consisted of a large enclosure, an adjacent mortuary temple, and a causeway leading down to a pavilion. About 80 royal pyramids survive in Egypt, the greatest being those at Giza. <br>  <br>  In 1842 Karl Richard Lepsius produced the first modern list of pyramids, in which he counted 67. A great many more have since been discovered. As of November 2008, 118 Egyptian pyramids have been identified.<br>  <br>  The location of Pyramid 29, which Lepsius called the "Headless Pyramid", was lost for a second time when the structure was buried by desert sands subsequent to Lepsius' survey. It was only rediscovered again during an archaeological dig conducted in 2008.<br>  <br>  Many pyramids are in a poor state of preservation or buried by desert sands. If visible at all they may appear as little more than mounds of rubble. As a consequence archaeologists are continuing to identify and study previously unknown pyramid structures.<br>  <br>  The most recent pyramid to be discovered is that of Queen Sesheshet, mother of 6th Dynasty Pharaoh Teti, located at Saqqara. The discovery was announced by Zahi Hawass, Secretary General of the Egyptian Supreme Council of Antiquities, on 11 November 2008|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	Many hundreds, if not thousands, but most have disappeared as they were not built of stone (as the well known pyramids of Giza are) but of baked mud which has eroded away over the years.

When it is a question of putting one person before another in positions of public responsibility, what counts is not membership of a particular class, but the actual ability which the man possesses.  No one, so long as he has it in him to be of service to the state, is kept in political obscurity because of poverty.  And, just as our political life is free and open, so is our day-to-day life in our relations with each other.  We do not get into a state with our next-door-neighbor if he enjoys himself in his own way, nor do we give him the kind of black looks which, though they do no real harm, still do hurt people,s feelings.  We are free and tolerant in our private lives; but in public affairs we keep to the law.  This is because it commands our deep respect...."

UAceROIUaa	Hey, I have read it.<br>  <br>  In the book he does meet a girl but the movie and the book are totally different! The ending is different and yes he does end up with a girl, her name is not Latikah though. The charcters names are all different! <br>  The movie features a few scenes from the book and strings them together in a different order.<br>  <br>  So in my oppinion the book is much better but I may just be dissapointed by the movie beacause it is so different to the book.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps (:

rT22hTL0aa	Purchasing the musical score does not give you rights to perform the work in a public place where money will be exchanged (i.e. your charity concert).  You get a performance rights licenese and to get it you need to look at the royalty agencies.  There are three big ones in the US:  ASCAP, BMI, and The Harry Fox Agency.  Contact the agencies to find out which artists are with them (it also may say on the music next to the composer's name (John Doe, ASCAP).  There are some links to help you out.  That's all I can offer.  I've always performed my own music or public domain (no longer under copyright)  music so I've never actually tried to get a license before.  (By the way, my music is licensed with ASCAP)

srNBx7sLaa	It's not often I disagree with the man above, but this does absolutely nothing for me I'm afraid. It seems like nothing more than a collection of sentences, most of which repeat one word. I think your creative tendencies could be better employed in another form of poetry. For all I know, it may be a good example of a Ghazal, but Ghazals, in my famously humble estimation, are not good examples of poetry.<br>  <br>  I'm familiar with the ones I like that provide a challenge equal to the results. I'm dismissive of ones I don't like and tend to forget them immediately. Haikus, for example, I do not consider poetry in the slightest - just about anyone can write them. When the bar is lowered to admit almost everyone then it's pandering to the lowest common denominator.<br>  <br>  I've got 3 poems up at the moment - have a look if you want.|`|dQmFoRRiaa	The ghazal is a beautiful, and difficult, form and your poem is novel in its imagery and rich in diction.  I am carried back to the Late Pleistocene world of our hunter-gatherer ancestors, a world where life was lived close to nature and men and women were more intuitive perhaps and also more inclined to view nature as the great mystery it is.  Our world has lost much of that sense of immediacy and enchantment; we no longer carry the Venus of Willendorf about with us.  We take the world for granted.  You have taken us a step back towards that time of wonder with your ghazal.  If you were going to rework this, I would change very little.|`|n9hRyHpqaa	I am not familiar with this style, but I enjoyed reading what you have done with it.|`|1lCUPVAkaa	I have not knowledge of the true form, But your poem is a heartfelt<br>  history lesson for reflection. well done.|`|Ko7NMfoAaa	it's ok|`|WbRuTjmFaa	You have done well with the ghauzal I have no criticism constructive or otherwise, I do not like the limit it imposed and after writing a few and being told I was not welcome in that country repeatedly  I deviated from the end words matching on some and finally stopped posting as I didn't particularly like the harrassment I was getting.|`|wWL934E8aa	I finally found information about it.<br>  As far as I can tell, you nailed it.<br>  <br>  Interesting content!

sfqwon7haa	If the looting and burning had moved into the white neighborhoods you would have seen a lot more deaths.    I live in Orange County, but worked at the time at the edge of the riots in Compton.  I was very surprised to find out how armed my friends and neighbors really were.  It was a topic that none of us had ever discussed.    People would have protected their homes and families with massive firepower.|`|AA10256080	There have been many riots which you could reference for pertinent information.  For example, the Tulsa Race riot of 1921.  While the official death count was 39, the Red Cross estimated the number killed at around 300 and others put the number much higher.      You might also find the riots of Newton, Iowa 1937 of interest.  Although they were caused primarily due to union strikes, their interest is due to the fact that true martial was instituted.  True martial law is not simply the arrival of military to control violence, but also includes the taking-over of all civilian functions including the courts.  Post the civil war this may be the only U.S. based riot where this occurred.    The Detroit Riot of 1943 is another one which is not often talked about.  This one takes on interest as it occurred during World War II (as did the 1943 Los Angeles Zoot Suit Riots).  The Detroit riots lasted 3 days and had an official kill count of 34 people and about 1,800 arrested.  (As a personal note, I had a relative as part of the military who entered the city and he always said that the dead was far more than 34).  This one is of interest because it began in one part of the city (actually on Belle Isle) and moved up Woodward Avenue to around the Fisher and GM Building locations and then moved west into the 12 street area.  It is very likely that the entire area up and down 12 Street would have been burned to the ground if the military hadnt arrived just at that time.  The military was described as federal troops ordered in by President Roosevelt and technically they were, but actually they were the federalized Michigan National Guard.    While Wikipedia credibility can be question, as a source to begin research it is often helpful and that is quite true in this case.  At  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_rio...  You will find a list (by date and country) of more riots than you can possibly use.      Your goal for the plot of a book is interesting and I would suggest looking at the details of several of these riots to augment it..|`|RQf13R74aa	Interesting theory, and best of luck with the book.  Have you read Lou Cannon's book on the riots, "Official Negligence"?  He describes an event during the riots which is much like the start of your novel....

FQLlne9vaa	Pros: we all occupy one world, other nation's problems will effect us eventually, just because the Atlantic Ocean divides the U.S. from Europe doesn't mean that WWII will eventually reach the U.S. WWII will also help pull the U.S. from the Great Depression because it'll jumpstart the economy.<br>  <br>  Cons: WWII is a war fought among the European nations, who have been fighting wars like this since the fall of the Roman Empire, the U.S. has no business getting involved in this. In addition, the Atlantic Ocean is a great enough barrier to protect the U.S. from Nazi invasions. Getting involved in the war will incur war debts and war is never a good thing. Also, there would be a high death toll.

PTdy6TWRaa	This effect is usually created by using selection or mask tools in Photoshop to select the area of the photo that you want to keep in color. The inverse selection is then simply desaturated.<br>  <br>  I don't know of any free online software designed for this task other than Gimp but you might get a light version of Photoshop for free by asking around. It seems that so many digital cameras, printers and scanners these days come bundled with a light version of Photoshop - and many people never even use it so they'd be happy to share I'm sure.

Sex is also created to procreate, which u wont do in heaven.  When u finally experience the intense sex  thru commitment and love, with only that one person, your spouse, will you see that all you have had before was garbage, something your hand can do for you.  good luck in finding that special person.|`|1e4622c41080edcef755ae0f3f517e48aa	We should probably start from near the beginning here.    Many sects of Christianity divide the content of your personality and experience into different portions:  those that arise from your soul and those that arise from your body.  To the soul they attribute your personality and pleasures like love and to the body they attribute your physical characteristics and pleasures like sex.    When you die, then, your soul proceeds to whatever destination is intended for it but your body is left behind.  A soul cannot hunger and it cannot feel lust or cold or any other bodily experiences.  It operates on a different plane.    Advocates of these notions would probably tell you that although that means that sex is a limited time offer, it doesn't mean you should seek it out.  That's like saying that because a restaurant is closing you should eat as much as you can nonstop before it does.  That kind of behaviour can only make you sick and can only inhibit your development in the long term.    Rather, they would probably say that BECAUSE sex is something of the body which comes and goes you shouldn't worry about it at all.  Focusing on that is like losing your high-paying job because you kept stopping on the way to work to pick pennies up off the street.  If the best part of sex is love and closeness, then you certainly have as much of that waiting for you and more.  The real experience that sex was only a shadow of.    And for the record, there are many humanists who might say the same thing.  Sex is nice to be sure, but it's certainly not the be-all and end-all.  Develop some understanding of the many beautiful and wonderful things in the world and you can only be ahead by anyone's estimation.  Peace.|`|26DoxkOBaa	First of all, I don't believe in Lucifer, but I believe God exists. Second, your physical body has it's own demands that impinge on you. So as a spirit occupying a body in the the physical world, in which you have completely identified with, you, of course, identify with your body's desires for food and sex and think they are you. I think when you drop you body, after is gets too worn out to occupy any longer, your body and it's demands get recognized as not being you, and for the time in heaven or hell those desires are pretty much gone away.    It's after your life is completely replayed in heaven or hell and your unconscious desires for food and sex coming from the higher part of your mind start filtering down that you begin to squirm for another physical body to satisfy those desires. You then wait in like a train depot to leave the upper regions of spiritual planes and to synchronize your karmic patterns with those who about to become your parents, all done within illusion, of course, since only God exits.|`|3eIuXzrAaa	Heaven is for non believers ;)    Love is all you need, screw heaven :D|`|lVAe2SLXaa	That all depends upon your definition of heaven and god.

Unfortunetly, the dead don't really come back to tell tales, and I won't know till I am dead and gone, and don't even know if I will be able to come back and tell you.  So you will just have to take your fun where you can, just in case there is no sex in heaven, and hey it will just be the icing on the cake if there are houries waiting there for you to please your every desire in heaven.|`|FY4cCjsOaa	Two comments on that in source; both from one writer (who seems to have thought about it, or to have run into people who took your position, fairly often).

Really, I know you didn't ask anything about this, but when you know those chords you can build off of them so quickly.

a6GA0VrOaa	Just start getting into local theatre productions. i found that really helped with my confidence, and it also trains you more. Most Theatre places are free, but you have to get a licence but its normally only about 5 pounds. Im like you and don't do any clubs in acting, singing and dancing at all, but i found just doing acting at school and making my own dances at home really helps. Once you get better and go into more acting things then you can audition for small rolls in shows, any thing is experience.   My best advice is work your away up, you don't have to rush into acting so you can go slowly. Like one small roll at a time. So you can get better and better and more confident.

8ZcGDTzOaa	rights are a fiction, but responsibility is also a fiction.  nature imposes no such rule.  nature doesn't automatically reward the responsible or those who put in effort.    It makes sense to classify certain things as rights EVEN IF IT IS A FICTION, because that confers security, which makes for a more productive society.  If you call everything a privilege, people will be too concerned about losing such privileges than to do something productive.    Free food and health care are good things to classify as rights, because IT IS CHEAPER FOR SOCIETY to do so than to not.  If you don't, you get starvation, disease, crime, which is MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE than the costs of a few or even many freeloaders.  If you want people to behave more responsibly, teach that in free schools -- they won't be taught by nature because it is a fiction.  The only law nature teaches is survival by hook or by crook.|`|AA11564934	absolutely not|`|yOK32PM9aa	Jeremy Bentham famously called natural rights "nonsense on stilts".  They are just legal fictions, meaningless and unenforceable outside of the legal code that expresses and enforces them.  There can be no "right to free education" in Eritrea at the moment, for example. Having said that, they are very nice things to have around - providing we can agree on them. One way of looking at liberal democracies is that we are in a constant process of persuading one another as to which rights come at the top of the agenda, and which are more like privileges. I like your linking of this to obligations.  Society might be better if we talked about our duties to one another!  Update!  It just occurred to me that there is one defensible conception of Natural Rights, popularised by British Kantian philosophers in the 1950s.  These are rights that flow from the application of pure reason, such as a person's right to be treated the same as another person in the absence of over-riding reasons to the contrary.|`|S318F1ocaa	I do not believe in inalienable rights or "inherent" rights. Rights are neither a physical or metaphysical thing one s born with. Both rights and "privileges" can be won or earned. But as far as a euclidean axiom in this regard I would say the closest thing you could get to a self evident truth are that it is wrong to oppress people in certain ways. There are exceptions, and the wrongness is not inherent in the act but is rather more by common nature of a certain set of perceptions and understandings.|`|FY4cCjsOaa	I'll stand with Jefferson on this one: that people are "endowed by their Creator with inherent and inalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness." [That quote differes slightly from the final form of the Declaration because it's taken from Jefferson's draft version, which he later published.]    For some reason, you're ignoring those enumerated rights and talking about economic benefits of a well-organized and prosperous society, which are clearly a different thing and, I agree, far more debatable as "rights." [Don't get me wrong; I'm a neo-liberal and regard the attainment of a prosperous society in which the benefits of that prosperity are fairly distributed as a valid objective of social organization. I just disagree with the notion of calling derivative and circumstantial benefits "rights."]    But your argument that "inalienable rights" do not exist because someone could prevent their exercise misses the point: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are rights, even if taken away. Taking them away is oppression, and the oppressor is wrong, not right--hence we use the word "rights" to refer to them. That's what it means.    Later: In case the preceding is still not clear, let me restate it. When Jefferson coined the phrase "inalienable rights," he was explicitly addressing a case in which people had been deprived of the opportunity to exercise these rights. That did not make these rights any less inalienable; it made the King of England a tyrant.    To argue that they are not rights if it is physically possible to prevent people from exercising them is to argue, quite simply, that might makes right. Such an argument also displays appalling ignorance of the source of the phrase.|`|AA11550519	I think a right is anything you can provide for yourself. If you sprout wings, you have a right to fly. Otherwise, you have to reach an understanding with an airline. Basically, no-one can take your right, but you can't demand a 'right' from someone else.    A right to free speech isn't a right to a megaphone, neither is freedom of association your get-in-free card to a private club. If it depends on someone else, it is not inalieable. It's 'alieable'    Exactly, your right to life isn't a right to be fed! Btw I agree with many of your premises, yet i DON'T agree with socialistic ideas like universal health care. Either you have a right to your property, or you don't. If the government can be 'compassionate' to the less fortunate at your expense, then it isn't your property. If you have no say on how your money is spent, it's not yours!      Why do you?|`|28c0495788bedefa03a0bf8e36f5ed48aa	The farther up the social food chain one is the better one's "rights" will be guaranteed. There are many ways to orgainze society.   I would not advocate  education for everyone. In some cases it is an absolute waste of time and a hindrance to those are truly into being educated. However, the resources may not be there to cater education properly for individuals. An old friend from grade school could barely write his name. It was quite clear things were not going to get academically better with him. Perhaps he should have been removed and put into schooling that was more appropriate to the type of jobs would be available to him.    Whether there are rights or not you will still have people who are unwilling to work.   You'll also have people in unfortunate situations due to no fault of their own.  These people will get help in our society. There may be many reasons: genuine charity, opportunity for everyone, reduces crime, aesthetics(it doesn't look good to have homeless and sick wandering the streets and regular citizens feel safer without that condition), allays anger of those afflicted(or lazy).    You cannot force someone to participate in society but where do you go from there? Cast them out and they live in disease ridden shanty towns?|`|PEVkrOVVaa	There is not such thing as rights unless you can assert them.  We give rights to ourselves and they are rights only they are asserted by us, otherwise those right are trodden upon.  So I agree with you all things are ultimately privileges, that some assert as their inalienable rights.
dXW9cPWMaa	It really doesn't matter what genre you're writing in, but on how your character views the story. If the character is the one who's the most important in the story, maybe first person is better - I'm writing in first-person present tense right now because it's essential that the reader discover things as the character does, which requires first person. But in, say, Harry Potter, the reader was supposed to be able to empathize with all three main characters, which couldn't have been done if it was in third person. This is why first person works better in Twilight - the reader learns things when Bella does, which is better for the plot and "romance."    For the most part, stories that are more character-driven can be more easily written in first person, and stories that are more plot-driven can be more easily written in third person. And generally speaking, romances are generally more character-driven, while books like sci-fi or fantasy can be much more plot-driven. Of course, there are always exceptions, but this is what's generally out there.|`|2Sjn4B9eaa	I think first works better for all genres, it really allows the readers to get inside the main characters head.|`|AA11586196	Thrid person is usually a better choice, especially if you want to change points of view or employ an omniscient narrator.

I find that writing in first person limits the perspective. If I wanted to express another character's feelings on the matter, (eg: "I thought he was cute. He thought I was too.") you can't really. How would this character know for certain that he thought she was cute? Third person lets you get in all the characters heads, but sometimes you can lose that personal voice... It's a toss up, I guess...    There is no specific way of designating which "person" works for each genre. It really is all about the authors choice.|`|4bb8aefb2a2ea8d99c78d3fbc5220586aa	depends on your plot. i'd say i'd prefer first.|`|KAVjtye4aa	Third person for a first-time novelist as it allows you flexibility and does not restrict your narrative.

I am italian so I know that if we say 'quasi", it could mean almost, resembling, in the style of, or as if it were a cello but not quite. (Pedal note effect).

0XsykyuFaa	is the source of multiplying     life is like gift that we should not waste|`|26DoxkOBaa	This is from a book review of God Speaks that expresses what I have personally found out to be the meaning of life.    The first phase of God's journey is evolution. It is initiated from a totally unconscious God as if an infinite Ocean were in a state likened to deep sleep. This unconscious God speaks the First Word "Who am I?". This question disrupts the limitless, undivided, absolute vacuum, and its reverberations create individualized souls, compared to drops or bubbles within the Ocean. By speaking the First Word, God establishes the process of Creation, in which he assumes evolving forms to gain increasing consciousness.    Individuality is the vehicle of this quest. Evolution marks a series of temporary answers to "Who am I?" The soul traverses a multitude of forms, beginning with simples gases and proceeding slowly through inanimate stone and mineral forms. These early evolutionary stages obviously have only the most rudimentary consciousness and cannot provide a satisfactory answer to God's original question.    The original query thus provides a continuing momentum for the drop soul to develop new forms each with greater consciousness, including the many plant and animal beings. Every evolutionary kingdom reveals new dimensions of consciousness and experience. Each also offers opportunities to gain different kinds of awareness. For example, when the soul identifies itself with varied species of fish, it experiences the world as a creature living in waterconversely, as a bird, it enriches its consciousness by flying through air.    When the drop soul finally evolves to human form, consciousness is fully developed, but an individual is still not aware of the potential of his or her consciousness.    So the original "Who am I?" imperative persists and inaugurates the second phase: reincarnation. Since consciousness is fully developed, there is no longer a need for evolving new forms. The individual's experience, gathered in early stages of evolution, is now humanized and expressed in countless lifetimes. The impulses gained in sub-human forms can play themselves out in the broader context of intelligence, emotions, choices, diverse setting and interactions with people.    But obviously no single lifetime can bear the burden of "humanizing" the entire evolutionary inheritance randomly or simultaneously. There must be a method for re-experiencing the pre-human legacy in manageable segments. The soul thus experiences alternately a series of opposites, organized according to themes. Accordingly, in different lives, the soul becomes male and female, rich and poor, vigorous and weak, beautiful and ugly. Through exploring the potential of these many opposites, one eventually exhausts all possible human identities and, therefore, has fully learned the entire range of human experience.    Here begins the third phase: involution, the process by which the soul returns to the full awareness of the Divine Force, which created him. As Meher Baba puts it, "When the consciousness of the soul is ripe for disentanglement from the gross world (the everyday world of matter and forms(, it enters the spiritual path and turns inward."    Like evolution, involution has certain states and stages, consisting of "planes" and "realms." But individuality continues along this spiritual path. In fact, the book quotes the Sufi saying "There are as many ways to God as there are souls...."    Each new plane denotes a state of being that differs from the states that proceeded it. The first three planes are within the subtle world or domain of energy, "pran." There follows the fourth plane, the threshold of the mental world, where misuse of great power for personal desire can lead to disintegration of consciousness.    The fifth and sixth planes represent true sainthood, which is understood to be increasing intimacy with God as the Beloved. On the sixth plane, the mind itself becomes the inner eye that sees God everywhere and in everything. "The loving of God and the longing for His union," says Meher Baba "is fully demonstrated in the sixth plane of consciousness."    The seventh plane marks true and lasting freedom. Impressions go. Duality goes. The drops burst and again become the Ocean. God answers his question of "Who am I?" with "I am God." The Infinite has returned to the original starting point. He now knows, however, with full consciousness and full awareness that he was, is and always will be infinite. And he realizes that the entire journey has been an illusory dream, the purpose of which is the full awakening of his soul.|`|37PpYx8oaa	Reproduction.

The modern version was originally published in 1960 by the Milton Bradley Company (now a subsidiary of Hasbro). Two to six players can participate in one game; however, variations of the game have been made to accommodate a maximum of eight or ten players.    The game consists of a track, on which players travel by spinning a small wheel with spaces numbered 1 through 10, located in the middle of the board. The board also contains small mountains, buildings, and other similar pieces, so the playing area does not appear flat. Playing pieces are small, colored plastic automobiles which come in six different colors (red, blue, white, yellow, orange, and green), and each pawn has six holes in the top in which the "people pegs" are placed throughout the game as the player "gets married" and has or adopts "children".    Each game also includes a setup for a bank, which includes imitation money (in denominations ranging from $5,000 to $100,000), insurance policies (automobile, life, fire, and/or homeowners' insurance depending on the version), $20,000 promissory notes, and stock certificates. Other tangibles vary with the game version.

ahjOfnIIaa	I am a HUGE Twilight fan, I LIVE, BREATHE everything Twilight, lmfao......you have no idea.........anyways......I think when he says this, what Stephanie is trying to convey is that Bella can never understand what it feels like to wait 100 years for the love of your life to come along and complete you until she has lived 100 years as a vampire and then she will understand why it is so important to Edward that he marries her , she won't understand until she has seen the world through his eyes and can "appreciate" why he feels this way......Hope this helps =) <br>  xxoo|`|jeqxygkFaa	it is important to edward bc all bella wants to do is have sex with edward, but he deosnt want to untill they are married. that was their deal, they get married and bella gets what she wants|`|0cmdnVTOaa	hmm....idk!!<br>  <br>  <br>  but i'm gonna keep comin back to this question and hopefully someone will know!! :D|`|TAN5a8iwaa	I KNOW!<br>  HE WANTS TO MARRY HER BECAUSE THE VULTRY WANT THEM TO NOT SIN...|`|n9p5cycsaa	I think it's because he wants to 'protect both of their virtues' and because he is 'the type of boy who gets married right out of high school.' He doesn't want to break any more of 'gods laws' or something like that.|`|Jv78Qxd8aa	Hello Esme.<br>  <br>  I think it was important for Edward, because he is 'Old Soul' he was raised in a time that, when you fall in love, you get married.<br>  <br>  Aro *hiss*|`|QOEkUuDxaa	we all know that she wants him....but, she doesn't really understand why he wants her so much. so, he is hoping that when they get married that she will finally understand someday why he wants her.|`|VtUPI9Lgaa	He is an old-fashion boy who has stuck to his morals about marriage (which i wouldn't mine especially if it was THE edward i was marrying so i don't get why bella complains about it.)<br>  <br>  As for the quote i have two thoughts about it:<br>  1) he wants her to have time to experiance being a vampire first and why it is important to him that he marries her. <br>  2) he probably doesn't know the answer himself and wants more time to figure it out himself. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps and i love the series!!|`|nQZEJz5yaa	... because if she doesnt marry him he wont bite her and make her vampie? i dunno... i think its cause if he doesnt marry her then he wont bite her so right now she only really wants to marry edward so that she can become a vamp but of course she still WOULD want to marry edward! WHO WOULDNT? lol but when shes vamp then she will see how hard it is to bite a human and suck their blood without killing them so shell appreciate that he was able to do it cause he loves her?<br>  <br>  LOL thats wat i think...<br>  <br>  i dunno if what i wrote made ANY sense..|`|GRzAxgfdaa	I believe its this: <br>  He states later in the book that he wants to hold on to Bella's last chance at heaven if she is to die, because your not suppose to have sex until marriage, and that is what she wants most from him at the time being. So, he is saying that in a hundred years, she will understand that after you've lost all meaning to live in the moment because you live forever, you hold onto any chance for heaven. Especially when your a vampire, you greatly conflict with some of the Bible's top sins, like killing and lying (about their ages, that they are human, etc.). I hope that made sense! If it didn' and you'd like me to explain more, just let me know! :)<br>  Happy Reading!

az2ZBy3iaa	Hey, I'm 19 and I don't have a girlfriend. The reason why I feel fine is because I have pursue something else in life (I'm studying engineering, no jokes about it please...), and I realize that having a girlfriend would only slow me down and wear out my ambition. You said you want to be a pilot? In that case, understand that having a girlfriend would only distract you from that goal, and that once you make it as a pilot, you'd be getting a girlfriend for sure (pilots are authoritative figures, girls love that).|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...join the military it will turn your life around...<br>  ...it will get you in shape, you meet interesting people and you will have money...<br>  ...and you get to travel to exotic countries too...|`|YmtNel5haa	I have been where you are before I didn't have any esteem.  It was just me....My sister was beautiful and always dated the boys I liked.  It wasn't until we were older that she told me how much she just wanted to be herself and she couldn't because she had to please everyone.  She said it pissed her off that it didn't seem to bother me that I had no real friends, she didn't know that it bothered me.  She thought because I didn't feel this urge to conform that I had it made. We are both happy with life now (more or less) and realized that high school life is crap.  What doesn't kill you makes you stronger.  I have had many dates, they were people that liked me for me.  My sister still tries to figure out how she can be herself and a people pleaser.  I am now engaged to a very amazing man, and I can tell you that this part of your life will pass.  Listen to some music-write some poetry, it's very cathartic.  Good Luck. Hang in there, better times to come.|`|qDYzdz5daa	Well, let's see...<br>  <br>  I never did much believe in God.  That's never been a problem for me.<br>  <br>  I didn't have a girlfriend until I was 23.  <br>  But I've been with my wife for 11 years now.  <br>  <br>  I can tell you, I was once just like you in being desperate for a girl, and all that.  But I realized something - girls can smell desperation, and it makes you creepy, too.  Once I dumped the desperation, and all the attendant baggage, the girls started to find ME.<br>  <br>  I didn't have friends as a kid.<br>  I had a few in college.  But only a few.  They moved away, eventually.<br>  Now I no longer have close friends.  And it really doesn't matter.<br>  <br>  Okay, fat I can't help too much with.  I'm a diabetic and I need to lose 20-30 lbs, but I'm having a really hard time, too.  Perserverence is key.  Me, I lose the weight in summer because I can walk outside, but gain it back in winter when it's too cold.<br>  <br>  So I'm buying a treadmill this year, and dumping ALL junk food.  I've lost five pounds in the last month.  Not great, but it's a start.<br>  <br>  In summation... you will not find happiness by searching for it.  It is not from without... it is within!|`|Ba5PVgHMaa	It'll be ok. LIfe does suck sometimes, but you just got to persevere. The fact that you've never had a girlfreind does NOT make you a failure.

You just have to start out by fixing small things, mabey you can go to a parent or a trusted freind and just tell them how you feel and mabey they can help you out, and give you encouragment.<br>  Hang in there.<br>  It will all work out I promise.<br>  I'll keep praying for you.<br>  <3|`|rk8MBfbLaa	1.CALM down!<br>  relax and think positively.

One has 7 kids and 5 grandchildren, the other has 2 kids and 3 grand-kids. I don't think they spend a moment of their life thinking that it was so bad that they didn't have girls at 18. What book promised you a relationship at 16???<br>  <br>  This is really no big deal and your life must be pretty amazing if you aren't complaining about being beaten, having no food or having to slave in a sweatshop.<br>  <br>  Count your blessings, and enjoy your life.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	The teen years are hard for most people.  I'll pray for you.  Have you ever asked the Lord into your life?  I did many years ago and He has helped me and blessed me a lot.  Try reading the Bible, New Testament first.  I found answers there.  Here are some verses to look up that may help you:  Romans 10:13, Romans 3:23, Romans 6:23, Romans 5:8, John 3:16, Proverbs 3:5,6.<br>  Also, Philippians 4:6,7 says:  Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God.  And the peace of God which passes all understanding will keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus.  <br>  There's another verse that says to seek first the kingdom of God and all these things will be added unto you. <br>  I believe God has a reason for all things.  He may be protecting you from some bad things.
Gfu1Nm0Gaa	make some pillows - so easy - go to a fabric store and buy some pillow forms - buy some fabric - 1 yard usually covers two pillows.  You can sew them by hand if you do not have a machine.  Cut the fabric 1 " longer and wider than the pillow forms.  Put fabric front to front and sew up 3 sides - turn right side out - put the pillow forms in and sew up the 4th side.  All done!!!!   Can't be much more creative than that!!!

KBBonf97aa	Most great guitarists don't have piano skills unless they were forced to take lessons as kids, but if you played a keyboard, it would be a good break for your hands since you've got tendinitis.  I've played bass and guitar for more than 20 years, but it became pretty painful because I've got carpal tunnel syndrome in both hands.  Since I still wanted to be able to play music every day, I got a digital piano and alternate between that and guitar and bass.  Since your hands are pretty opened up when you play keyboards, it's a nice change for them.<br>  <br>  If you're very serious about your guitar playing, piano will probably help because it's a completely different approach to music.  By stepping out of your comfort zone, so to speak, you'll think differently when you play guitar.  Some people try to dabble in too many instruments and never master any of them, but I've changed my approach to songwriting since I started playing piano.  It's quite cool.  Good luck!|`|6SwaWSoyaa	I strongly doubt it. I know that they probably know a little something on the piano, but the piano is a complex instrument. The piano and learning any other instruments are very helpful and rewarding in playing another instrument. I personally think the piano is a lot better than guitar, but I know that many would disagree with me. They are entitled to their own opinions; however, I think both the guitar and piano/keyboard will help greatly in your sight reading and music theory. Plus the drum rudiments are quite essential for your music rhythm altogether. Percussionists tend to have a better time counting and keeping a beat in any instrument they play, simply because they had too.|`|bf15d509ad8c8861312488ea09c8eb1caa	Well, I used to play piano for a few years as a child. I've been playing guitar for 15 years and I have to say that my piano playing did help me as far as theory and chord construction. Do all guitarists have any piano skills? I would have to say no to that. But it does help. Thanks!<br>  <br>  B
P1alfkrJaa	All the `decent descriptions' you need are in the poem itself. It's one of the most descriptive poems in the English language. `In Xanadu did Kubla Khan a stately pleasure dome decree where Alph, the sacred river, ran through caverns measureless to man, down to a sunless sea. So twice five miles of fertile ground....' etc - Just draw what you see described in the poem. There's this enormous ten-mile wide dome built which encloses a sacred river and gardens and forests and there's sunlight and everything is fertile and beautiful. The end of the poem hints strongly (`ancestral voices prophesying war') at the pleasure dome's destruction and the last stanza, of course, tells about the speaker in the poem losing the vision of the paradise which is the pleasure dome. So I'd think you'd want to choose the beginning of the poem to depict - although the `Damsel with a dulcimer in a vision once I saw' part could also work well. All the best to you..........|`|7WgGfObkaa	The best description is in the poem.  It was an imaginary land, so we can't really say how you'd see it.|`|WX1b747Iaa	Coleridge.

hl4kkvXhaa	OK...I looked around, because I knew the basis of the story, but couldn't remember all the details...the eating paint part threw me off, as did the mental disorder suggestions.<br>  <br>  He didn't eat paint.  And he didn't cut off his entire ear.  He cut off the left lobe.  He sent the piece of ear to a "brothel wench" and asked her to guard it with her life.  Later, he attempted to drink a quart of turpentine in his studio, and was committed and placed under hydrotherapy for acute mania and epilepsy.<br>  <br>  Later, it was found out that he had contracted syphilus due to his "appetite" for prostitutes.  They believe that this, coupled with a history of mental illness in his family is what caused his erratic behavior.  It's now believed that he had a congenital brain lesion that was aggravated by absynthe (a highly alcoholic beverage).  <br>  <br>  I know first hand (a family member) that syphilus can actually cause brain lesions, which will result in mental disturbances such as paranoid schizophrenia and other mental disorders, so I am guessing that he probably had a lesion on his brain, either at birth as they believe, or because his syphilus went untreated too long (I've heard it be called the "swiss cheese brain disease" because it leaves tiny holes in your brain, which is what my family member suffers).<br>  <br>  Anyway, I found this link because I knew that the story you had read was incomplete.  My guess is that this is about as correct as you will find because this is the story I heard growing up (and I'm sort of old...lol).  That, and the fact that this is what they taught us in art class in college.  When I was little, I'd heard it was a romantic gesture to his love...and didn't hear otherwise until college (I guess they felt we were too young to hear the truth).  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/20527" rel="nofollow">http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/20527</a>|`|MwbgbJTHaa	Van Gogh had Epilepsy and he cut his ear off during a seizure.

SygvUa0Eaa	No confirmed date for the fourth book in the Inheritance Cycle has been released yet. However, I expect it should be soon enough, because he only decided to make it a cycle, rather than a trilogy, because he felt it would be too long of a novel. So, I'm guessing that he had already began the fourth book even before the publishing of Brisingr. And you know how authors are; he'll probably add another 100 pages for more money... <br>  <br>  Anyway, I'd be expecting the book to come out in... Late July or early August... But that's just a guess. It should definitely be this year, though.|`|Rhuyvq2Zaa	There has been no official release date set for the 4th book. Everything is speculation. So far there has been a 2 to 3 year gap between books, so I would recommend patience. <br>  <br>  Paolini did say that by the time Brsingr was released, he had the first 100 pages of the next book written. Hopefully this will speed things up.|`|4Xvyq6GNaa	I'm fairly certain that there isn't a set release date as of yet for the fourth Eragon novel.  However, judging by the time it took to get the third one out, I'm betting it'll be a while...<br>  <br>  As for the movie, I highly doubt there will be any more released, at least not any time soon. The director of Eragon, Stefen Fangmeier, has several projects in the works for release this year or in upcoming years.  At the very least, no official announcement has been made about a movie based on Eldest, and no page exists on IMDB.  <br>  <br>  So basically, I'd bunker down and settle in for a long wait on the Eragon front.|`|sop6UrDOaa	I heard November 17, 2013

AA12343309	My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer.<br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.<br>  <br>  Cyndi'sList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.|`|Bp6254Vbaa	There is, and the complete URL is found below.|`|MtO5BXOBaa	the website for the church of the latter day saints aka mormons <br>  supposedly they rebaptise people when they die so they have lots of geneological info on there for people all over the world plus its free<br>  <a href="http://www.familysearch.org/eng/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.familysearch.org/eng/default....</a><br>  <br>  hope this helps and good luck

ZLWswKHHaa	What are QCSEs? If you want to be an actress you don't need to go to a college. It is really fun and you learn a lot, but it's very expensive. My advice: save a ton of money, move to LA or NY and take several acting classes, work part time, and audition constantly. If you are dead set on going to a school, you have to audition if you want to get into a conservatory program. I went to AMDA. They have a BFA program now. It was great. Our stage combat teacher used to work at Yale School of Drama and said he came to AMDA because they pay more. They have great teachers. You don't need much experience if you are good. Choose two monologues. Not popular ones, they've seen them a million times and you won't stand out. Most schools won't let you audition for gigs till your final term. You can make great connections though.

az2ZBy3iaa	Completely random in what sense? Mutations are indeed completely random, but the traits that survive are not. For example, what percentage of humanity have a dominant trait that triggers a complete autoimmunity? As far as I know, none, because such a trait would have been eliminated through natural selection (the dying off of those individuals of those traits).|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Darwin should be admired for his intellectual courage and his determination to go against all normal teachings of his day. His work is the building blocks for understanding not only for nature but religion physiology and many other disciplines of our day and generations to come.<br>  <br>  Physical facts are fairly uniform, but truth is a living and flexible factor in the philosophy of the universe. Evolving personalities are only partially wise and relatively true in their communications. They can be certain only as far as their personal experience extends. That which apparently may be wholly true in one place may be only relatively true in another segment of creation. Page 42-3|`|g4nlUfmeaa	The theory is evolution.  Natural selection is more like a law that has been incorporated into the theory of evolution.  It's a simple concept that is self-evidently true, and can be readily verified by empirical observation.<br>  <br>  Think of natural selection as a filter.<br>  <br>  When an organism reproduces, there's a chance of a random mutation that will create a new allele (basically, version of a gene).  Those alleles can be detrimental to the offspring's reproductive fitness, neutral to it, or beneficial.<br>  <br>  That's where natural selection comes in.<br>  <br>  The deleterious alleles will tend to get weeded out, because if an allele results in a trait which hurts the organism's chance at successfully reproducing (like dying early) then that allele will not tend to propagate within the species population -- the offspring produces fewer or no offspring, so that allele is not inherited and probably eventually disappears from the gene pool.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, neutral alleles might be inherited, while alleles that improve an organism's reproductive fitness will tend to get passed on, and are more likely to become the norm within the species.<br>  <br>  That's all natural selection is.  Random mutation, far from disproving natural selection, is actually part of what makes evolution by natural selection possible.  Mutations produce variation, and without variation you would have stasis.  Stasis is the opposite of evolution.<br>  <br>  So natural selection is what imposes order on what is otherwise a random process.|`|r7zdpQNnaa	Not really cause mutation happens rarely. Natural selection, passing of the genetics of the animals that are fit to survive and breed is the number one part of evolution. Passing of genetic mutation would mean that the individuals with the mutations would have to be able to breed with each other to make that a genetic feature, so that isn't as a big part of it as you make it sound.|`|wvVPMjfjaa	You could say that. But if Darwin had it his way, then there sould be no diseases and sicknesses because the weak would have died out and the strong would not have inherited those problems. survival of the fittest is what they say...|`|L86QJXzEaa	Nooo...<br>  the beneficial mutations stay, and the harmful ones go with the death of the disadvantaged creature (in general)

HUDjXVOyaa	I highly suggest tape which is acid free. It is also called "archival." <br>  Another thing to consider is to have tape which is not permanent because of restoration purposes. If a print or picture needs to be cleaned or restored many years down the road, art conservators need to take things apart. A collector may also wish to change the matting as well. <br>  <br>  If you are familiar with the brand "Scotch," they have a scrap booking tape which is available at Micheal's Craft store. It's acid free and non-permanent. Many of my friend who matt their prints use this tape. I do also. If you can find and buy this tape at a smaller locally owned art store, even better.

If you're just starting to act - and I mean REALLY just starting to act, as in, you've never been in a school play or done a drama club at your school, go to an acting school. The best of the best are the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and the Lee Strasberg Institute. If you are not located in NY or LA, the only advice I can give you is to get coaching from someone legitimate, or start small with school plays.<br>  Remember, every bit of experience you have counts - maybe not on your resumé, but it hones your talent, even if people tell you that you're a natural. Join a community theatre group, even if you want to do film. Participate in student films. Acting is about self-discovery and sensory. Start paying attention to everything around you, how certain people walk, talk, and act. Film yourself trying on different walks, and see how it makes you perceive the character you're playing. <br>  13 is not too late. However, very few professional child actors make it to adulthood still doing big-time acting. Start harnessing up your talent now, so you can show the world what you're about professionally later. If you want to act for fame and money, don't even start trying to act. You have to love to do it - it takes a lot of perseverance to make it in the acting world.|`|HkEAPJ6Waa	Oh yes, far too late.

yuuvBSKsaa	Your biggest PROBLEM is that Rand has accurately defined freedom.<br>  <br>  "Freedom needs some kind of limitation...."<br>  <br>  Seriously are you listineing to yourself?  Limintation is the restriction of freedom.<br>  <br>  The political spectrum IS  a measure of personal freedom.  The absolute personal freedom of the far right is called Anarcy.   The far left's  absoltue subjucgation of personal desire to the state is called Communism.<br>  <br>  You are correct that Anarcy is a hard state to endure.  It does constitute absolute freedom, but one's personal safety suffers.   <br>  <br>  Communism on the other hand renders you safety irrelevant because you have no freedom.  You MUST obey the state.so your life doesn't really belong to you.<br>  <br>   Money in your pocket is very much and indicator of what you are 'free' do do.  So the degree of your freedom can be pretty much defined by the degree of taxation.<br>  <br>  So here's the political players next to what they think the max tax rate should be.<br>  <br>  Anarchists (0%), Libertarians (10%), Conservatives (20-30%), Moderates (30-50%), Liberals (50-70%), Socialists (70-90%), Communists (90-100%) <br>  <br>  Ayn Rand was originally from a Socialist country and HATED the repression of personal freedom she endured there.  So while she wasn't an Anarchist, she was considered the spirtual mother of the Libertarians.  Rand believed the best society was one that maximized personal freedom.<br>  <br>  Though it's hard to see, morality is a restriction of personal freedom.  Most however would agree it's a necessary restriction for the benefits gained by it's empowering of collective action.  There is safety in numbers.  <br>  <br>  You however are likely in a Goverment school, with a Goverment teacher who likely sees their job as making you a good Socialist.  You will be relentlessly taught that the group is more important than you.<br>  <br>  In short you are being taught not only to be a slave, but also to hold in contempt those who would champion your freedom.  E,g. Ayn Rand.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Let us not bifurcate freedom into true and false category.<br>  <br>  I feel freedom means that one should remain independently (I mean without depending on anybody). Freedom also means liberation from bondage or ignorance. Freedom also means non-interference of other persons in our affairs.<br>  <br>  Above all freedom is for doing all type of constructive, positive, creative, idealistic, progressive, purposeful, valuable, useful and productive work. Freedom should not be misconstrued for doing destructive or negative type of activities.|`|F0ImwHlUaa	No one is free. Freedom is just something you achieve from people and day to day duties. This might be a joke to you but freedom is just a word that people believe that they can achieve. Really they can't because their is always something that gets in the way.|`|V60mZea1aa	Freedom to me is , for no human being having any power over another human being.|`|81f4bd177f89ba16026dc0eb51fd1cbaaa	Well, Princess. Like me put it this way, Freedom is one who can DO things -- that they are in control of their life, that they have a will to DO and has mastered themselves. The problem is man is a organic machine. As people we do not do things really, our lives are moved and usher by the happenings of external stimulus outside of us. Everything for us is accidental and we live in a state of unconsciousness, a sleep from which we do not possess ourselves as a people who can go about and do things, but everything is on autopilot for us. If you observe yourself, you will see a machine - that your life is just functions with little consciousness. <br>  <br>  Rand's theory, I do not know of it in its entirely, but from what you said of her, I would agree with her -- but my agreement is from a different perspective. Because each person must become a conscious egotist in order for real freedom to be had. And what I mean by that is, everyone must work on freeing themselves of their mechanicalness and become united in themselves first. Socrates said, "Know thy self" -- it is through ones quest for this knowing of self, that can produce the desired freedom. Freedom, peace and the like must be things which can only come to this world by means of self work -- the individual development of each person striving for a higher ideal of being. Once people do this, their change within will have its natural expression to others. Think about it, one must liberate themselves first, in order to help others to be liberated. One can be in chains physically, but be free and have freedom. <br>  <br>  In saying this I know Rand was not referring to anything like this. But more or less one has to be selfish. One can be free and still help others and live for them. Freedom is really an inner quality, as one can be free from all around them, due to their inner condition -- the outer manifestations do not bother them, but they see things as they are not as they want them to be.|`|99RUGQq3aa	According to existential psychology, true freedom is being true to the part of ourselves that is born into interconnectedness with  other human beings AND being true to the part of us that is born to realize our unique individual potential. There is no freedom without commitment.  Ayn Rand is dead but she has inspired a lot of people to step all over others in their attempt to be true to themselves, assuming the person who does this experiences freedom.  Freedom from what?  Without care of the other (vs. ourselves,) we live in fear of being swallowed up by our own vast, terrifying emptiness.  Trust me, I'm a therapist who sits with people who suffer from the illusion that freedom is the end result of self orientation.|`|LntUwSucaa	There is no true freedom, all the time we are thinking off someone elses opinions and are having to live upto someone elses expectations.|`|pnoQFcT4aa	As the song goes, "Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose..."|`|a56ea048122de747d1f6aea080469cdcaa	honesty and happiness|`|nrdPJvufaa	Knowing Jesus Christ, the risen one, brings true freedom.|`|UkaH2iouaa	I agree with you. True freedom is limitation for the sake of the whole, instead of avoiding all limits for the sake of the self.<br>  <br>  If we don't put restriction we will always want more, it will be an endless process. One may give liberation to their flesh, but their minds and selves will be in cages of the past and future, of what they want to obtain, that to them, true release of the self and the acquisition of happiness would come once they obtain what they desire, but they usually never find it in what they have sought. Eventually not only they destruct their own lives, but freedoms clash together and conflicts happen. They would have to at some point destruct someone else in order to reach their desires and claim their supposed happiness.<br>  Is there true freedom in that? Perhaps the body is operating in all directions, but the self would be in constant anxiety about those matters that it desires, if whether they will be obtained or not, and it would be in constant fear of the loss of material.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Freedom is freedom, true is a euphemism for "As I see it."<br>  <br>  Truth is mostly subjective. So true freedom means freedom as YOU understand it.
Rh7k5fxcaa	Ecstasy is MDMA, or Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (sp?), which causes a reduction in the concentration of serotonin transporters in the brain. When you come down from ecstasy, you might feel a little depressed because your serotonin is readjusting itself. I seriously wouldn't recommend long term use, because there's no telling how long it will take your brain's serotonin to fully right itself and I've seen people get temporary (like 2 weeks temporary) total amnesia from mixing it with anything from alcohol to DXM, or Dextromethorphan. When you're on it, be careful who you're around, make sure its people you trust because when you're rolling, you'll trust and love everyone and you might even tell them stuff you wouldn't normally. So as far as drugs go, its relatively harmless compared to some of the stuff out there. I like it, but I only do it once in a while.|`|YA36FUf1aa	It enhances your enjoyment of things for a while, makes you feel happy and then it wears off.

l2E4qEsAaa	I think you're absolutely right.  When reading Heart of Darkness, a lot of people merely focus on the symbolism and imperialism, neglecting to recognize that Conrad, like all other British Modernists, was examining the inherent darkness in every human.  Conrad argued that an omnipresent darkness loomed in all human hearts.  A potential for sheer evil resides in all.  I don't remember the characters in Hotel Rwanda too vividly, but I'm pretty sure Don Cheadle's character had moments where he thought of putting himself and his own family first and then chose to selflessly help others.  In other words, the main similarity is:  regardless of race, ethnicity, social status or intelligence, we all hang dangerously close on the edge of an impenetrable heart of darkness.  Humans must combat their evil insticts or be lost forever, like Kurtz or those who committed evil atrocities in Rwanda.  <br>  <br>  PS-- If you get a chance, read Ishmael Beah's Memoirs of a Boy Soldier.  It reminded me of both Heart of Darkness and Hotel Rwanda.|`|fEaNKJ92aa	They both have to do with imperialism. We are studying imperialism right now and we talked about both of those.

0HAn67yZaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheyenne</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cheyenneindian.com/cheyenne_history_001.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.cheyenneindian.com/cheyenne_h...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Indigenous people of North America whose language belongs to the Algonquian branch of the Algonquian-Wakashan linguistic stock. The Cheyenne abandoned their settlements in Minnesota in the 17th cent., leaving the region to the hostile Sioux and Ojibwa. Gradually migrating W along the Cheyenne River and then south, they established earth-lodge villages and raised crops. After the introduction of the horse (c.1760) they eventually became nomadic buffalo hunters. The tribe split (c.1830) when a large group decided to settle on the upper Arkansas River and take advantage of the trade facilities offered by Bent's Fort. This group became known as the Southern Cheyenne. The Northern Cheyenne continued to live about the headwaters of the Platte River. For the next few years the Southern Cheyenne, allied with the Arapaho, were engaged in constant warfare against the Kiowa, Comanche, and Apache. Peace was made c.1840, and the five tribes became allies. The Cheyenne were generally friendly toward white settlers, until the discovery of gold in Colorado (1858) brought a swarm of gold seekers into their lands. By a treaty signed in 1861 the Cheyenne agreed to live on a reservation in SE Coorado, but the U.S. government did not fulfill its obligations, and the Native Americans were reduced to near starvation. Cheyenne raids resulted in punitive expeditions by the U.S. army. The indiscriminate massacre (1864) of warriors, women, and children at Sand Creek, Colo., was an unprovoked assault on a friendly group. The incident aroused the Native Americans to fury, and a bitter war followed. Gen. George Custer destroyed (1868) Black Kettle's camp on the Washita River, and fighting between the whites and the Southern Cheyenne ended, except for an outbreak in 1874-75. The Northern Cheyenne joined with the Sioux in massacring Custer and his 7th Cavalry at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. They finally surrendered in 1877 and were moved south and confined with the Southern Cheyenne in what is now Oklahoma. Plagued by disease and malnutrition, they made two desperate attempts to escape and return to the north. A separate reservation was eventually established for them in Montana. See G. B. Grinnell, The Fighting Cheyennes (1915, repr. 1956) and The Cheyenne Indians (2 vol., 1923, repr. 1972); E. A. Hoebel, The Cheyennes (1960); D. J. Berthrong, The Southern Cheyennes (1963); Joseph Millard, The Cheyenne Wars (1964); John Stands in Timber and Margot Liberty, Cheyenne Memories (1967); P. J. Powell, Sweet Medicine (2 vol., 1969); John H. Moore, The Cheyenne Nation (1987).<br>  <br>  Chief Black Kettle<br>  <br>   Few biographical details are known about the Southern<br>  Cheyenne chief Black Kettle, but his repeated efforts to secure a<br>  peace with honor for his people, despite broken promises and<br>  attacks on his own life, speak of him as a great leader with an<br>  almost unique vision of the possiibility for coexistence between<br>  white society and the culture of the plains.<br>  <br>  Black Kettle lived on the vast territory in western Kansas and<br>  eastern Colorado that had been guaranteed to the Cheyenne<br>  under the Fort Laramie Treaty of 1851. Within less than a<br>  decade, however, the 1859 Pikes Peak gold rush sparked an<br>  enormous population boom in Colorado, and this led to<br>  extensive white encroachments on Cheyenne land. Even the U.S.<br>  Indian Commissioner admitted that "We have substantially<br>  taken possession of the country and deprived the Indians of<br>  their accustomed means of support."<br>  <br>  Rather than evict white settlers, the government sought to<br>  resolve the situation by demanding that the Southern Cheyenne<br>  sign a new treaty ceding all their lands save the small Sand<br>  Creek reservation in southeastern Colorado. Black Kettle,<br>  fearing that overwhelming U.S. military power might result in<br>  an even less favorable settlement, agreed to the treaty in 1861<br>  and did what he could to see that the Cheyenne obeyed its<br>  provisions.<br>  <br>  As it turned out, however, the Sand Creek reservation could<br>  not sustain the Indians forced to live there. All but unfit for<br>  agriculture, the barren tract of land was little more than a<br>  breeding ground for epidemic diseases which soon swept<br>  through the Cheyenne encampments. By 1862 the nearest herd<br>  of buffalo was over two hundred miles away. Many Cheyenne,<br>  especially young men, began to leave the reservation to prey<br>  upon the livestock and goods of nearby settlers and passing<br>  wagon trains. One such raid in the spring of 1864 so angered<br>  white Coloradans that they dispatched their militia, which<br>  opened fire on the first band of Cheyenne they happened to<br>  meet. None of the Indians in this band had participated in the<br>  raid, however, and their leader was actually approaching the<br>  militia for a parlay when the shooting began.<br>  <br>  This incident touched off an uncoordinated Indian uprising<br>  across the Great Plains, as Indian peoples fro

IvfQdMNhaa	My favourite rhyming schemes are terza rimas: aba bcb cdc ...", ending on "yzy z", "yzy zz", or "yzy zyz". and the octava rima:"A,B,A,B,A,B,C,C".<br>  <br>  I find them both very pretty.

bdnMQnVHaa	There were Russians who opposed the Bolsheviks, like anti-socialists, pro-czarists and anti-Bolshevik socialists (Mensheviks).  Also Allied Powers invaded Russia to persuade Russia to rejoin World War I.  They were reluctant to leave after the war ended.
lPxVt2XYaa	There was very little democracy in Tsarist Russia.  Before the 1905 Revolution the only democratic institutions were the Village mir - a sort of village council charged with allocating land, some legal issues and very little else and local, regional councils - the Zemstvo.  The mir was not a powerful organisation - as it had no political clout outside the village and the zemstvos established after Emancipation in 1861 were dominated by the aristocracy.<br>  After 1905 the Tsar gave the zemstvos more power, established the State Duma and did not close down the spontaneous, democratic councils known as soviets that were springing up across the country.  But he tried to rein in the Duma, dismissing it when its composition was too radical for his tastes, did not listen to the advise of his ministers and tried to carry on ruling the country as an autocracy.<br>  The effect of the long term ban on political parties, and the refusal of the Tsars to accommodate more people into the political system was that for many people felt that the only way to reform the monarchy was to overthrow it.<br>  See:<br>  Russia, People & Empire 1552 - 1917 by Geoffrey Hoskings<br>  Russia, A  History - Geoffrey Freeze<br>  <a href="http://www.studyrussian.com/history/history.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.studyrussian.com/history/hist...</a>

0sTvM6gKaa	I would say try all the classes you're interested in and decide from there.<br>  <br>  Jazz is a really good class to take for a beginner class (even though ballet IS the best for your technique,) and you'll learn many combinations, leaps, turns, and jumps. plus, all the stretching will greatly help your flexibility. after taking jazz you could try other types of dancing such as contemporary and modern which are really interesting. <br>  <br>  <br>   If you try jazz and don't really care for it, there's always hip hop. Hip hop is good if you're not the shy type of person, and like to make big movements. Personally i'm not good at hip hop because of my modest personality and the fact that I enjoy ballet and lyrical dancing more.<br>  <br>  Lyrical is another option. it's kind of a mix between jazz and ballet. it's more jazzy, but you still do most dance moves turned out to make it look pretty, and it's very graceful and emotional. Probably not a great class for a beginner, since you should be more accustomed to technique before you get into the emotion and everything.<br>  <br>  Tap is really hard to take as a beginner. I've taken it since age 5 and now 11 years later it comes naturally, but, it's one of those things you should learn as a younger child and definitely if you plan on taking it for awhile. you have to be really sensitive to rythm and sounds. I know alot of people who have taken it later and find it really challenging.|`|B8cLlmI4aa	hey im 13 and just recently started dancing too :) <br>  you should probably either take jazz or hiphop. but the thing about jazz is, some parts are similar to ballet, so if you dont like ballet, chances are you wont be a big fan of jazz. <br>  hiphop is fun and a great way to get loose ;) it's also a good skill to have <br>  <br>  just have fun. they should have some trial classes wherever you'll take class <3|`|LaCj6C8Raa	I have to come in and push my style of dancing.

PTdy6TWRaa	With downloaded pictures it's often possible to enhance or improve them with some careful work in Photoshop. But there are limitations. You cannot take a too blurry or grainy picture and make it crystal clear or take a very small picture and scale it too far without causing an obvious loss in quality.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure what you mean by "HD" but if you're thinking in TV and monitor display terms then this is refering to resolution - About 1920x1200 pixels. In order to create a picture to look its best at that size you need to work from originals that are at least fairly close to that size or larger to begin with. If you do have good original files to work with then in an image editing program you will be able to scale, crop, sharpen and adjust color and saturation to create the HD image you want.|`|LVpyaf48aa	if you are willing to break the law by editing the photo (or get a copyright license from the photographer/artist) you can increase the resolution of the image which MIGHT make it a little clearer. but you can not focus a photo with software... yet. If your intent is to make it larger you are limited by the pixels available... You cant make a passport photo into a billboard.

This inflamed the Cubans and in what they thought was defense of their homeland ordered missiles from USSR.   It was certainly a bad move on Cuba's part and we almost went to nuclear war with the USSR.  I was 12 at the time and I will never forget the fear we all had.  Duck and cover drills in the halls at school, bringing in canned goods to school, etc.  I used to lie in bed at night and each time I heard an airplane, I thought the Russians were going to bomb us.  Eventually, Kennedy pulled out the NATO missiles from Turkey and Kruschev took the missiles out of Cuba.  Kennedy made that proposal to the Russians through his brother Bobby.  That way, Kruschev could save face.|`|qDSvOOwBaa	Great answer Gail-I remember that as well. The supposed missiles in Cuba were not operational and never would be for months-if ever. When the JFK Act was passed in 1992 and President Clinton signed it into law( a decision he would soon regret) In the over 1.000.000 documents released to the National Archives were quite a few dealing with Cuba and the missiles  Of the documents I copied when I was last there in 2003 was President Johnson "Godamn Kennedy was running Murder Inc. in the Caribbean-lets just hope no one finds out it was all just bullshit with the missile crisis.  So what did I take from that-There never was any "Crisis" at all.Just as LBJ said it was all a game of ego and stubbornness played by JFK and the CIA, with Hoover playing along as well.      s_e_s|`|0abc7b6c3865e21018ce64c64d0ea018aa	c|`|0385spDQaa	It is definitely C, I've just finished the topic in history, it was really interesting!
2JOes8EJaa	If you're just starting out, I'd say just focus on getting the best drums that you can find within your price range and don't worry too much about a specific brand.<br>  <br>  Don't buy new, look for something used. The age isn't as important as the condition. Do a little research and buy something from one of the major drum makers: Tama, Pearl, Ludwig, Pearl, DW, Yamaha... there are others, and good ones, but those are big companies that have been around a long time. If you find a set within your price range, just do a little research to see if you're looking at one their low, mid, or high range kits - most companies make drums in levels or "tiers" like that, they're just called different things.<br>  <br>  Drums aren't "fragile", per se, so when you check out a used kit, just look to see whether it seems to have been taken care of. Little little scratches and gouges in the wood are annoying, but they happen if you play long enough, especially if you move them around without cases. But things like that are generally just cosmetic and won't change how the drum sounds. Definitely look for signs of mistreatment though, especially cracks. If you really want to get picky, take off the drumhead and feel both the rim and inside the shell; you'll feel cracks that you won't see. (You can do the same with cymbals.)<br>  <br>  Buying used will let you save a little money towards some other stuff that you might want to upgrade; new/different cymbals and stands, a new bass drum pedal, a throne, things like that. <br>  <br>  Once you've been playing awhile, you'll definitely develop some strong opinions on what you want out of a drum, sound-wise. There's a lot of things that factor into it: the type of wood, the thickness, the circumference and depth, the heads.. the list goes on. If you play enough and do a little reading, you'll figure all that out.<br>  <br>  Hope that gives some stuff to think about. Good luck!|`|Lk0noY62aa	Pearl.<br>  <br>  And if you drum hard rock music like I do, then you'll either want a double bass pedal to use with a single bass, or a double bass kit with seperate pedals.<br>  <br>  I prefer the double bass with 2 seperate pedals.

Mzu9bHbmaa	If you don't already know how to model in 3D, then this is going to be an impossible task. 3D modeling and animation is quiet difficult and it takes a long time to get a handle of it. Even so if you want at least want to know where to start I recommend one of the following programs:  -Art of Illusion- It's a free 3D modeling and animation program. Even though it's not that popular, it's probably the easiest program of it's kind. The interface is really simple and you won't have to bother with extra software. Basically, it's everything that you need.  -Blender-Like AOI, it's also free. But Blender is more difficult to use due to it's bigger set of feature and weird interface. The advantage of Blender is that it's more popular so you can find a million and 1 tutorials on it. Plus you should have no problems asking for help online.    Two final points:  -Do not pay for an expensive 3D software like Maya or 3Dstudio max. Blender and AOI will just as useful(Maybe more useful) to you.  -Expect to spend at least 3 hours a day everyday between now and Valentine's day learning how to do this. Even then you might to be able to pull it off.

This allows the reader to make up their own minds, without a baised view as to what was happening (i.e. during Tom Robinsons trail). Very clever!    as to the ending, for some reason it made me cry! I think it's a fantastic ending, and is really moving. It's hard to put into words, but I never get emotional over books, and this is the only one over which i have. it's beautiful! lol! =D

The Islam only been there for a few hundred years. And now they say it's theirs. I guess I fail to see the logic in that one. <br>  During and After World War II the Jews felt the only way they were going to be safe from now on is to have their own country. So naturally they tended to gravitate to the land of their birth.
xijX0yIKaa	If you want to have a regular rhythm, try iambic pentameter or iambic tetrameter I would think, they're easy to read and write and are not a restricting as they seem.<br>  <br>  Common metre may also be useful, so you'd have quatrains which alternate between iambic tetrameter and iambic trimeter.<br>  <br>  Try looking at other narrative poems and getting ideas from them, 'The Rape of The Lock' by Alexander Pope, 'Poetry my ****' by Brendan Kennelly or various translations of old poems such as 'The Cantebury Tales', 'SIr Gawain and the Green Knight' or 'Beowulf.'<br>  <br>  For free verse, I don't think you could get much better than 'The Wasteland' by T.S. Elliot.<br>  <br>  Basically, just find something you're comfortable with writing with and stick to it!

o40QqoQGaa	I think it is because of Jacob, and his love for Bella. While Edward and the rest of the Cullens love Bella and will do anything for her, so they are afraid that if the Warewolves dont protect Bella properly like they are supposed to, then the Cullens will be mad, and go after them. But the Wolves were created to protect the humans from vampires, so they have to do their job, and it just so happens that is Bellas life that keeps being put in danger.|`|0vlm2OZcaa	It was mainly  because of Jacob's friendship with Bella and it was also their duty to protect humankind  by destroying vampires who are their  mortal enemies that was why the existence of werewolves emerged. If it weren't for vampires, the werewolves wouldn't exist in the first place.|`|7OIc1Ze8aa	The wolves' law is to protect all humans from vampires. If there was a vampire on their land, they'd kill it, no matter if it was threatening anyone or not.|`|klFwButzaa	Because jacob's in love with bella and he's second in command in the pack so apparently that means shes like family|`|nOezzy5caa	because jocob is in love with her and she also became friends with the other wolves so shes like family and jacob is in second command of the pack|`|JZCbAR4Yaa	I think it's because they don't want any humans to suffer at the hand of vampires.<br>  <br>  And there's the fact that Jacob is in love  with her. If Sam and the others don't help then Jacob will go and help Bella on his own and that is as good as signing his death warrant. If the wolves want Jacob to stay alive then they have  to fight with the Cullens to protect Bella.|`|TOAiSbPYaa	because Jacob is in love with Bella and it would possible kill him if she was dead so they dont want to hurt Jacob like that .

amcqJkWhaa	Why don't you post your stuff on the critique forum on conceptart.org <br>  I've seen some very good anatomy advice on the sketches there. It would be a good idea to have a picture not too polished, to put up there, so you can integrate their suggestions and stuff. <br>  <br>  You don't need a figure drawing class to draw people. I take it that you're surrounding by a fair number of people each day. Work out your observation skills, maybe sit down some time and sketch, too. <br>  <br>  Maybe just do one drawing per day (at least, and practice can mean you do something new, each time, just trying out things)... oh, you can also get a mannequin, or an movable action figure (w/ joints), or maybe order a skeleton from a science site or something...|`|dKrLAJaEaa	Virtual Pose 1, 2 and 3 and your computer screen for viewing the models .

FZZTb7Y0aa	google books is great<br>  <br>  :)|`|zvhZ0Dsoaa	Google books.<br>  <br>  Type in the book and below the title it will give you the number of pages.<br>  Hope that works for you.<br>  <br>  Oh, and it will also provide information on where to buy the book and offer you the cheapest one. Comparing prices and all.|`|4Xvyq6GNaa	My favorite website is amazon.com. It will tell you the number of pages in a book as well as offer great reviews (and the opportunity to review). Just type the book you want to know in the search engine and scroll down to its bio.  If you sign up, you can rate books you like/dislike and they'll provide you with recommendations for other books you might like.|`|lohDMuGEaa	Amazon.com lists the pages for books, but only for a particular edition (most often amazon.com only will list the page count for the most recent/popular edition, not older editions). Goodreads.com lists the page count for all editions of a book, paperback or hardcover, old or new, and that's what I use. It's really useful if you have/want to read an older edition but don't know the page count.

ZkfL6ONBaa	Well if your teacher says you can do pointework chances are your weak foot isn't that week. It all depends on your type of foot. Do you have egyptian toes or english american? I would recomend somthing with a soft shank and suportive vamp. I have a little trouble with my right foot and have tried dancing in capezio's and had to drop out because of the shanks hardness. I finally decided to brave pointework again (of course with my teachers approval) and tried bloch axioms they are very easy to break in but do not "die" as quickly as serenades also they make my size 8 foot look gorgeous not blocky.Also a gaynor midden would be an appropriate kind of shoe for you. Gaynor middens are good fro beginners and pros becuase of the supportive vamp and soft shank also if it is available where you get your dance suplies i would go with a swayed tip it lasts much longer. Also, you might want to do the first few months en pointe at the barre. This gives you a taste of pointework and time to strengthen your feet. Another note NO dark sotas!!! they suck all the calcium out of your bones and you need strong bones to take on pointework.....  Good Luck!! i hope i helped.......|`|0aEYjVzMaa	if you have a weak foot then you'll injure yourself no matter what type you use.  i know it'll be hard, but wait and build up your feet until they're strong enough|`|Kgav4sM6aa	if you have a weak ankle i suggest that you do not do point i couldn't do it and i was very upset but i wouldn't want to risk another injury|`|MgeXAibdaa	Then your simply not ready, pointe shoes are all about the strength of your ankles and if you don't have a strong foot frankly you shouldn't take the risk of injuring yourself.|`|dnMvibooaa	id suggest something with a soft shank so that you can break it in easier. if soft is too soft, id try the grishko proflex if it fits you correctly. the proflex has a shank inbetween soft and medium.
FaX8awk1aa	Archbishop William Laud (7 October 1573  10 January 1645) was Archbishop of Canterbury from 1633 to 1645. He pursued a High Church course and opposed radical forms of Puritanism. This and his support for King Charles I resulted in his beheading in the midst of the English Civil War.
