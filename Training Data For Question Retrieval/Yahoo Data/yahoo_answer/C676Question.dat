The cane always seemed to be pretty cruel to me, but the slipper seemed to be a pretty fair punishment that got results. Quite a few friends also had the threat of it at home if they misbehaved. Do you think it should make a come back - or have you ever used a slipper to discipline? or were you on the receiving end?

20090308031616AASAn0g	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I talk to my mother who verbally abuses me if i do not go home to her every weekend from college?	I am 20 years old and have a mother who is verbally abusive. Through out my life, my mother would used different tactics to keep me under her control. I have always been a a filial daughter, obeying her wants and needs. I was forced to grow up older then all my peers, taking care of my little brother as she goes to work, keeping track of her bills, and cleaning up the house. I always try my best in school and all the things I have done was to make her proud. Until now, my mother consistently pushes me down emotionally by using vulgar language, calling me stupid and useless. Now that I am a junior in college, the abuse has not stop. I feel that my mom uses me as a punching bag to release her frustration, because I don't talk back. She always talk about her hardships and I would listen. But it is so repetitive. I always tell her to be courageous and stand back up, but she plays herself the victim. The great lesson I learned in life was to not play yourself the victim, but be a survivor. Furthermore, I am a very jolly and perky person, always trying to be optimistic, but internally I'm wilting away. My mom expects me to go home every weekend  and every week that I do come home, its the same routine all over again- taking care of her bills, cleaning after her, and running errands for her. I have always tried to do my best to satisfy her and every time I make a mistake, she polarizes the negative and never once mention the positive. I have been with my boyfriend almost close to 6 years, and she hates his guts. She does not support me with money for college  nor provide me with the positive support that I desperately need to stay afloat.  I am a full time student and work to make ends meet. But she does not understand that I can not come home every weekend. She called my boyfriend and accused him of being the bad influence and threatened to go to his work place and make a scene. I do not know what to do. I love my mom, but she does not understand that I go to school five days a week and on weekends, I still have to study. I haven't been home over three weeks and she left me over six voice mails, cussing me out, calling me a bad daughter, and giving reasons that she took care of me as a baby and now I'm turning my back on her. I cry, because I feel that I am wrongly accused.

20090308032137AAakVpa	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should we still be friends? Please i need help ASAP!?	OK, so here's the story,      Ages ago (since september) I use to have a best friend. When we joined high school, she just completely ignored, ditched, made fun of and told all of my secrets. Eventually i got sick of it and extremely upset of it, so i confronted her and said: "i don't think we should be friends anymore", then she called me a self obsessed b****  etc...      Last night i was at my friends sleepover, her name is Emma and she lives in an estate, my other to friends came too. One of my supposed friends name Ciara was there and we have been best friends since we have been born and we shared many good times. My ex-friend Hazel and this girl that follows her around called Faincha was at another girls sleepover (siofra) who lived down the road.      Emma and my other two friends Aoife and Ciara decided to prank Faincha (we didn't know about the sleepover at the time). We pretended to be people from a survey. Hazel knew who it was and said to Ciara:"oh look at the f******* ginger" (she has ginger hair)   Faincha said to Emma:"Emma, your a** is so big you need a suction, when you walked into the youth club, you should see how weird you look and you party sound s***". Emma and Faincha were best friends (before Hazel)  but Hazel prevented Faincha  from being friends anymore.   they said to Aoife:"who the f**** are you". (they don't know her)   to me they said: "Oh, is that Ally, i can hear your lisp voice, remember in the adventure centre the guy called you lispy mclisp lisp?""your nose is weird and you look like a hippopotamus you are so fat".   so my friend Aoife got upset (about them saying it to me) she said:"well Hazel, just to tell you that i couldn't tell the difference when i saw you wether you were a male or female"."you should take a look in the mirror for once instead of commenting on our appearances, take a look at your own and you might see but you might not as you are a retard how ugly, freckly and fat you look and same to you Faincha!      I just want to tell you i am 13 and a size 8 so i am not fat and i have been getting speech therapy for the last few months and the lisp is gone (says the therapist). Faincha and Hazel are size 10-12 (i know thats weird that i know their size, but they used to complain about being fat when they were friendly with me) and my nose is indeed similar to Rihanna's (as i have been told).       So we hung up and Emma and i were upset (Ciara always pretends she isn't though) and Emma said what else did they say? (Emma and Aoife didn't know that Hazel and Faincha said i had a lisp) and a few minutes later ciara says "They said you had a lisp and your nose was big". I always get low self esteem when someone talks about my speech negatively as i was bullied in the past about it and Ciara slagged me before. I feel like Ciara wants to make me feel bad about myself, whenever someone says something negative or gossips about me she always tells me and exaggerates completely about it. That really p***** me off she knew i was upset but wants to make me feel worse.Should we still be friends? When i go to school tomarrow Hazel and Faincha will be spreading rumours about me and Emma as they did before but all of my other friends will stick by me (i know that). I want to tell mum but she might go crazy if she thought we prank call! Aoife said to ignore them, it is way easier said then done. Should i be friends with ciara?   here are some pictures if you don't believe me.   me: (on the 2nd one im on the left.    http://i568.photobucket.com/albums/ss123...     http://i568.photobucket.com/albums/ss123...    Ciara:    http://i568.photobucket.com/albums/ss123...  (on the far right with pink/purple t-shirt)   Do you think i don't she is jealous (she hasn't much to be jealous about if it is me though)!
20090308032728AA7bIvc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are women who dress slutty bad/immoral?	Women in miniskirts and high-heels, super cleavage, etc...   Basically like club wear.  Anybody who has been to Times Square on a Saturday night knows what I'm talking about.      I don't think women who dress "slutty" or provocatively are immoral, or bad.  I think they are beautiful and intimidating.  Then I think, is there something wrong with these women, letting it all hand out?  But then I think, I LIKE women who are comfortable with their bodies.        I'm a pretty open-minded guy, so what the hell is my problem?    Maybe my insecurity and fear of rejection.  Maybe that causes me to complain about the very thing I love.      I feel I can never be worthy of these women.

20090308032744AAN0e7l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This girl likes me.. And wont go away..?	I started talking to this girl through myspace a few years ago. Turned out she lives only 10 minutes away from my house in a neighboring town. When I first started talking to her she was really sweet, funny and pretty. I was very interested in her. When I told her that, she went and found a boyfriend who wouldnt let her continue talking to me. Well when they finally broke up, she started talking to me again and then became interested in me. and her excuse is, she didnt have a chance to get to know me, and now that she has she feels like she is falling in love with me. Well, while talking with her, she seems to be a little.......a few marbles short.. Not to mention she is a couple years younger than me and has NO IDEA what she wants to do with the rest of her life and mine is already established. How can I tell her I am not interested after trying so many times.

20090308031809AAVEubX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm 22 and never been on a relationship. Normal?	So I'm a 22 year old girl and i've never had a "real" relationship with a guy.   I've been on some dates but they never led to anything. About 1,5 years ago i met this one guy who i dated for about 3 weeks and thats also when i lost my virginity. It just didn't work out with him, HE was too clingy (how often does that happen with guys?? :S). And i really didn't like him enough to stick around. It was more like physical attraction...      I often feel sad when i see a happy couple and i really miss having someone to hug and kiss and to hold hands with.   I just never seem to find a guy who really cares for me and who is not just looking for a "bedbuddy" etc.      Do you think this is normal, anyone have similar experiences?   And for those who are in a realtionship, where did you meet your bf/gf?   People often say i'm cute, havent heard many people call me beautiful so i guess i look younger than my age. And i do get approached by guys at bars and such but they never really seem to care for the real me.      Thanks to all who take the time to help me :)

This semester, hes in my Italian class. My best guy friend is also in Italian, and he happens to be best friends with the guy I like. The first week we all sat on the same table, so it was easy to talk to him. But now we have assigned seating and my best guy friend is on the opposite side of the room when I'm stuck with the guy I like on my table. I mean, I wouldn't be complaining if I knew how to talk to him! Usually I'm too nervous or afraid if I'm gonna say something totally wierd. We do talk but I usually run out of things to say and when he tells me jokes I just laugh like a fool. I cant seem to be my usual charming self and its really making me sad that I cant communicate with him! I think he knows I like him and hes being really nice and funny but I just dont know how to respond.   I didnt tell my best guy friend I liked him but I think hes figured it out. If he figured it out is it too obvious? Is that a good or bad thing?? Should I ask him to help hook us up for prom dates? Prom is soon too and I'm so confused. :(

20090308034622AARL1uM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should I even bother?	Now there is this girl that happens to be married to my husband's best friend. Aside from the fact that this person has a major personality disorder and no personality to speak of, I seem to find myself in situations were I do things for her that she shows no real appreciation for.       Example: Her husband was in the hopsital for a few days and since she has separation anxiety issues she had to stay at her mother's house, so we did their laundry for them and took their dog for a night and stuff. I even rubbed her back and comforted her when she started crying and all that crap. (She's pregnant)      Now..at my husband's behest, I'm throwing a shower for her and I feel stupid doing it because she shows no interest in it, or even showing me appreciation for doing it. I try to call her, she never answers; I text her (which is the only thing she replies to) and she's extremely curt and brief with me. the only person she seems to want to talk to is my husband, since she texts him and calls him whenever she has a problem with her husband or something (which is more often than not) and she will talk to him and answer his phone calls and everything. I really could care less about this woman, but I just feel really dumb for going out my way for someone that when we are in the same room, she barely says two words to me about anything. So should I even bother with trying to be at least nice to her like this again?      (I know that the situation with my husband is very strange also. Why she is always so willing to talk with him with her complaints is beyond me)

20090308034218AAwqbiA	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help please. 10pts best answer. What do I do?	Ok well I had this best friend.   We were like sisters, so close, told eachother everything etc. Theen, about a year or so ago, she stopped talking to me (on the school holidays) when I asked what was wrong she clammed up and told me that I was being hell rude to her mum and brother (total lie). So I apologised and she was still really angry.      Anyway, we didn't talk, and then she misread (literally) a message I sent a friend over myspace about me and her, and she got sooo pissed off at me. Even after I told her she'd misread it (it said 'eh' not 'ew' like she thought).      So since then we have not spoken (a whole year!)   Its really weird, because she always bitched about the group of girls I sit with, but now shes alllways coming over to our group and talking to all of them but me.      What do I do? It's so.. strange, I never pictured this happening? Whys she doing this?      Thanks

20090308035904AA401Or	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Advice on dating an autistic girl?	I met a girl recently that told me she was "a little autistic". Since she told me, I really see it. She displays many autistic traits (organisation, seems distant etc) but is extremely well spoken.       The thing is, I like her odd behaviour - she keeps me guessing!       I need advice on how to approach this from the perspective of a girl on the autistic spectrum and any guys that have dated such girls. I've known this girl for a few weeks, and she is only just starting to open up. I know that I will have to take it slow, but yeah, any other advice is welcome.      Thanks in advance

20090308034111AAxaV0M	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this an acceptable standard for a committed relationship?	I know a lot of divorces and breakups are caused by money issues.    But would you say it's acceptable to tell your spouse that if they don't make as much money as you or if they don't go into a career field that makes a lot of money you won't share a joint bank account, you may leave them and buy your own home, or possibly divorce them?    AFTER expressing you really want to settle down with them?      Do you think this sis something someone would say in a healthy, close relationship?      Would you say it's putting money before love?

20090308035434AA5EkQ6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my ex still taking advantage?	My girl broke up with me on tuesday after we had been together for over a year. we just got a house together, and she's been driving my car for months now (i have another). I still love her madly, and of course I freaked out when it first happened, but now i'm trying the "i agree with you we should break up" approach. she has been staying at her best friends house most of the time and leaving me to feel responsible for our puppy. if i take my car back, won't i seem bitter? or will it come across as "i'm ready to move on and you're not going to take advantage of me"? I def don't think that it's fair for her to do anything other than go to work/school in it, but i don't want to have this convo and it be MORE damaging to the relationship. Also, I want to cut off her contact with me...should i go shack up with my mom or stand my ground and ask her where she's staying?

[plz dont lecture me about love... im not here for that]      what's the sweetest way i can tell her to make up for all the times i haven't??  what would appeal to you most??   * she wrote me 3 love poems and a love letter for valentines day,  so i'm not gonna do a poem, i would like something really unique *      p.s. she likes all that cliche romancy stuff i.e cuddling in bed watching movies for a whole night, walks on the beach, watching sunsets, just staring into eachothers eyes for ages, lots of kissing and having baths together ( call me a retard sissy, i dont care i personally enjoy doing that with her =] ).     and she is smart, funny and sporty [if that has any importance]      plz be serious   thanks...
20090308042222AAAMoVG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	True or false - if a guy likes you he will call you?	I don't like chasing guys and I think that if a guy likes you he will contact you first.      It's also easier for me because I just don't initiate the contact with the guy and if he never calls I assume he's not interested and move on.      Do you agree?
20090308040943AAZTFK5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys - is it a turn off if you know a girl you like is dating other people?	Say you meet a girl at something like speed dating and she tells you she has still agreed to meet the other guys from there.      Would this make you more interested or less?      Until you're exclusively dating do you care whether the girl you like has been on a date with some other people? Or would it be better for her to say 'I'm not seeing anyone else' (as long as that was true)      It's just guys seem to like a challenge and a bit of competition.

20090308043813AABbJgN	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do you deal with people who always try to undermine you in public?	I have a friend that always, constantly tries to undermine me, like when we're talking about work, or anything.      She's a nice person overall but I can't stand this in her. I don't like to go on the defensive, cause it would just look stupid. How to nicely answer her, to show that I know what I am talking about while not seeming offensive?      So, for example I'd be talking about how we are working on a model at work for xx, and she'd say: "oh, haha, you now understand what xx means" and I know I am much better at it than her, I have so much more experience in the field but I am not going to tell her this to her face. I am not this immature to argue about stuff like that but I don't want to seem stupid in front of other people.      Or she'd say: "you know, you need to start learning how to be independent", when I've lived and worked alone for 4 years in college and she still lives with her parents.      You know what I mean. I just can't stand her comments no more! How can I stand up to these comments without being mean?

We have not had sex in a year, because I have been resisting it that long. He told me that maybe having sex just this once might help out our relationship. Today, he started joking around about how fragile I am. I weigh 87 pounds and I'm 5'3. He is 155 pounds and is 6'1. A long with the fact that his muscles are pretty nicely toned. <_< But he started joking around that he had a hard time having sex with me because he feels like he's going to break me. He still says it's cute though. But, I was thinking that maybe I should gain a little weight just for the purpose of him trying to be too gentle. Should I or shouldn't I?

I and my girl friend are quite persons, we do not make noise and cook. the problem is that My flatmate cook everyday at 1 a.m. in the morning, since I live in living room ofcourse it is so annoying, They all the time watch movie in the living room although they know I am sleeping, they also never turn off the tab that the water keep following all the day in the kitchen, I am the one who always turn off the tap for them. Not only that, no one wants to clean the unit, I used to make a timetable and sugest them to do it together but they ignore it so that I am the one who clean it for them.       No one appreciates what I always do for them, they even try to ask my girl friend to go away at night reasonging that I pay less and I am not suppose to have my girl friend with me. I explain that we only see once a week and it is dangerous to let her go home at night alone on saturday night but no one care. All of them threatened my girl friend and me by saying that they will crush our face if next time they see my girl friend.      Recently they created a untrue story and tell my land lord that I am very dirty and never clean anything (of course it is up side down). Since They are 3 people and I am only the one, of course my landlord believes in them and the landlord asked me to go within 2 weeks. They did this ***** thing to me only because I always tell them to be quite.      It is not a matter that I go and look for another apartment. Although the landlord does not ask me to go I also will go myself. But it is the matter of justice, i think that it is very unfair and I am so offended by them, I really want to take revenge, my grudge is very strong, If they is no law, I have killed them long time ago while they sleep. I need to do something to give them the lesson. what is the best thing I can do to them? if you were me?
20090308041854AAsaVdO	Family & Relationships;Friends	If your sisters are mean to you are they just jealous of you?	I have two sisters who are really mean to me. They do not include me in outings. They do not include me in dinners they make. At a wedding recently, one came to me and said 'look at you, looking fantastic with a prestigious job!'. I am older, studied really hard, got a good job and look fine but they look good too. They always dated, I studied more. Why do they not like me? My aunt told me that one of them told her that one of her biggest problems is that she is jealous of me. I was shocked. I always tried to help them. Now this. We are in our 30s.

20090308045459AANazfb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ineed some love advice.?	I've been talking to this girl i work with since October now, when we first started talking we got on really well and i mainly spoke to her through msn. We went out on a date and it went really well she even said it was the best date she'd ever been on but she just wasn't looking for anything else! After talking to her loads she kept saying she wasn't sure how she felt so we went out again which was ok. After weeks off constant chatting every day she said she just wants to be friends, but i've fallen in love with her and i really dont believe she feels nothing. We still talk every day i've tried to make her feel special sending her flowers for her birthday and stuff like that, which goes down quite well. But i dunno what to do next she doesn't know i love her she just thinks i fancy her, i dont know if its wise to say it as it might make things worse. Im not ready to give this up just yet any advice?

I am a junior and a guy who is very shy in high school and I am not so lucky with girls really. But I know that the girl I will love forever is out there and I plan to show her how much I care for her by making her feel like the most special person ever. But I'm curious to know, in your mind, what are the things you look for in a guy to ultimately choose them as the one for you? I mean, all girls really have a TON of guy friends, how do you know which one of them is the right one?

I have a crush on this guy who admitted that he liked me back, but he sort of restrains from freely admitting that he likes me to other people. We always do hang out, and we get along really well, but I don't want to be 'just friends'. I really want things to go well, but I don't know if he's that interested.      I'm not sure if this is self denial or some sort of teenage awkwardness stage that he's going through.      Help?

20090308041551AA9Jzuf	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	HELP what should i do about my lying boyfriend?	I'm gonna try to make this as short as possible. Okay we meet in high school when he was 15 and i was 17. he was very shy and the innocent type. i'd say a couple years into the relationship i would catch him with porn on his computer etc. and he would lie about it, which i hated!!! Please dont lie once you've been caught. but anyhoo i always let that slide, cause its just porn i guess. well now we've been together for  8 years and we've been living together for 3 years. i ask him about his job and if there are any girls there and he says no, but then one day he left a message on my sisters phone talking to a girl, i was pissed that he lied about no grils working there, and the fact that he tells me he never talks to girls like that, I wasnt mad that he was talking to her it was just a conversation about music but i didnt like the fact that he lied. Then i'll just catch him with little things, like being online when he said he wasnt, just small things, like why would u lie?? and even after i show him hard eveidence he still tried to back pedal. Now today we bought a porn to watch together but i have it stored away in my drawer a certain way. well today I noticed the dvd that was in the dvd player was taken out and placed on top and i looked at the porn and it was not the way i put it. and the thing is the only time he could have watched that is well i was waiting in the car for him downstairs when i was waiting for him to go to "the bathroom"  which i dont know how long he took because i fell asleep waiting.  Anyhoo I kinda told him about it and asked if he watched it and he said no, but he was asleep so ill ask him again tomorrow, but i know hell just lie.       all these little lies eat away at me, and i just feel like i cant trust him. if he lies to me about these little things, and even after i catch him he wont admit it, i mean that makes me wonder what else hes hiding. I feel so hurt. I dont know what to think or do.  what do you all think ?   I've been stressing out about it and feel so horrible.

20090308042418AAnCdME	Family & Relationships;Friends	I made out with my friend's crush?	Ok, so we're not that good friends, but she had had a huge crush on him for like 6 months. Yesterday, i asked her if she still liked him, and she said yes, so i wished her good luck. But the thing is i've had a small crush on him for the last few weeks. He's possibly the nicest guy in my grade, and he's really cute. He's also very popular, but on the other hand, he doesn't care if someone else isn't, and he's really nice to everyone. So we were dancing and i didn't expect anything to happen, because my friend has been trying to hook up with him for so long, everyone knows it! and she's really pretty, so i thought i didn't have a chance. But we were chatting and he made a gesture that was so obvious, so i made out with him. And he later told me he didn't want it to be a one night thing, that he actually liked me.      So what should i do? i've apologised to my friend through lame facebook, but i don't know what to do on monday! all my friends think i'm a *****! also, should i go out with him?

I asked him to call me since he we have became close after we broke up, but I slept with his friend like 6 months after we broke up and that was a huge mistake on my part. Anyways he found out just a few months ago and I confronted it and told him that I did. But all he kept on saying is that " I don't care" repeating himself over and over!    Also he has been single now since we have broken up, no girlfriend whatsoever but then he was telling me about this girl that he met, who lives 3000miles away from him, this is the first time he has ever mentioned a girl to me. What is his problem does he really not care or is he jealous and is that why he had to mention that girl?   I personally don't care anymore about what he does if he is seeing this girl good for him I just want him to be happy in life, I am just worried that I will lose a friendship out of this.   Thank you.   Please Help

20090308044918AAelWgM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I handle this situation?	I have been with my boyfriend now for 2 half year, we have had good time and bad time, its just things have not progressed, he has told me that he doesn't know if he wants to get married, he has mentioned me moving in at the beginning, I have talked to him about this but it always results in an argument him going on about money, its like he doesn't want a commitment but he happy to carry on this way forever he doesn't want kids, which hasn't bothered me much because i not sure if I want any, I was meant to be moving in with him last year but i didn't due to him going on about money there was no romance, anyway a guy i liked from a bit back has started texting me nothing ever happened with us because i am with my boyfriend, its just he started texting me again and my boyfriend has told me he doesn't want to marry me in so many words, so what have i to lose by just going on a date..

20090308045701AAHEga2	Family & Relationships;Friends	Someone at my school's who I once considered my best friend's been spreading lies about me.?	Not the petty, gossipy ****, but I mean going to the police and trying to get me kicked out of school lies, she and her new boyfriend.  I don't even know why, and can't ask her or else her parents will call the cops.  What should I do?      I just bought a tape recorder, so that I can perhaps catch her contradicting herself, but most of our mutual acquaintances have broken off contact with her as she's betrayed them all (all for the sake of a stupid asshole she probably won't like in a few months).  What can I do to prove I'm innocent of the things she's accused me of?  I have done maybe one or two of the things she's said I've done, and because of that, people are willing to believe anything she says.

20090307221802AAKqWte	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I ask him about it?	So, I've been dating this guy for two years and we're expecting a baby in a few weeks.  We've been having relationship issues lately, but right now I just don't know what to do.  We share a computer, and I just went to get on facebook and his account was logged in.  He had open chats at he bottom window, and one of the windows open was a chat from earlier this evening between him and his parent's much older and married woman, and they were talking about how they're planning on having sex in the very near future.        We don't normally share accounts, and he would probably be mad that I looked at his account, but I've seen the conversation, and now I just don't know what to do.  Should I bring it up to him?  I'm freaking out right now.  We're 22, and the woman is in her mid to late 40s, married with 3 kids.

Ever since I was in grade school black girls haven't wanted to date me because I am too nice and I don't act like the average black guy. Whatever that means I don't know but that is what I have been told. White girls won't date me in the south because of what their parents might think of them. This girl I was getting to know better told me that she can't date me because of what her parents may think. She ripped my heart out when she told me this.They feel like their parents might not accept them or accept their relationship. What should I do about this. I feel so lonely because it seems like no one will date me because of things I can't control.
20090307223117AAjuf2w	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I ask a guy friend if he used to like me without it being awkward?	I became friends with this guy and I feel like in the first few months of our friendship, he began to develop feelings for me. For some reason, he abruptly stopped giving me signals that he liked me, and I think he stopped because I told him I was agnostic, but that's beside the point.      I really want to find out for sure if he liked me then, or if I was just imagining it, because I have a huge crush on him now, so I feel like if he liked me before, maybe if he knew I like him now then his feelings would change.       I know that this conversation will be super awkward, and I want to know how to go about asking him if he liked me in the least awkward way. Thanks!!

20090307222729AALGtOp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	PLEASE HELP! didnt get enough answers last time...?	Ive been talkin to this guy a bit. We hooked up a year ago and didnt talk much since cos i moved away. Now i'm back we're talkin but only over msn and text msg on phone.       I work at a club and he came in last nite but it was so busy i could hardly talk to him. I msged him today and said sorry i couldnt talk, and he said i looked really good last nite and he understands it was really busy.       Then i msged to him "im pretty sure u were the hottest guy at the club.. u should ask me out somewhere haha" and he asked wat days i have work this week. I told him but he didnt reply.      I was thinking of msging him tonight and saying "so mister, when u takin me out? haha" so it sounds kinda flirty/joking but it also gives him an opening to ask me out. We always joke and flirt with each other and act like we like each other..       I dont want to sit around waiting for him to ask. I'm a model and a lot of guys r tryin to get with me so it's not like I can't get another guy.. i just want THIS guy but i dont want to seem desperate/easy..      Also - does it sound like he likes me?  He came over to the bar just to say goodbye to me, and was always smiling when we were talking.  Maybe I'm overthinking this.. Am i pushing too hard?

20090307234752AAjyQZG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I thought I Was Over MY EX but He Just Texted me something That Made Me Cry? means i'm still not over It?	a very complicated story. his and mine.   but we were together for  three months four years ago , then we went a year without seeing each other. got back together, and were literally on and off every month for two years straight, until finally it trickled off into just spending nights together not even having sex just sleeping and cuddling.   we both went  in and out of other relationships all during those three and a half years, but still we stayed in contact even if it had been months without talking.   so its been 6 months and i was feeling sort of strange, not sure why but i wanted to see him tonight, maybe sleep over.   i texted him   can i see you anymore?   he texted    who is this?      i've changed my number 3 times since i've known him and just a few months ago but i know he had it. we have talked before with my having that number.   he deleted it   this just made me get teary-eyed. i believe some even spilled over.   very unexpected. i thought i was way over him.. i mean he'll always have a part of my heart but i'm not in love with him. how could it hurt me still?   now he just keeps texting me to tell him who it is but i'm not gonna answer.   im so hurt that it I wouldn't even come to mind.

20090308071119AAYWS6H	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	It's a long story,would you let your wife's druggie daughter destroy your life?	My wife's daughter is 33 and hooked on drugs.She has already been denied custody of her 3 kids and they stay with their dad.She just got evicted from her house,has no car,no money,and says no place to stay.She started on prescription drugs and now shoots up or does whatever she can get.I got laid off work in Jan and my wife has not worked since last July so she could be with her family whenever she wants(they live 100 miles away),my wife goes to visit them at least once a month,sometimes more even though we are struggling to survive ourselves.   I have been keeping us afloat by spending my savings from a sale of my house I owned before we got married.Now we are having to move because on unemployment we cannot keep living in our present house and there are no jobs here.Now my wife wants to move her druggie daughter in with us who has stayed with us a few times before for a short while.She is nasty,is like living with a rat,because she gets into the food pantry and fridge into everything,leaving bags of chips open and picking at her sores then touching food,she's just nasty.   Anyway here it is:If I don't find a decent paying job soon I am going to have to sell my Harley,maybe my car,and some property we own in Arkansas which I am still paying on.All of these things I had when we got married except the property in Ark which we bought with procedes from the sale of my house,she still has a house but it is rented out.She does not help with our bills and now wants to add her daughter to our problems.I know it is hard to walk away from your child,but I feel her daughter needs to hit rock bottom in order to decide that she wants to get help.Right now she thinks everything will be ok as long as someone takes her in for the night.   So do I continue spending on us to live,until I have nothing or do I leave now while I still have a chance to salvage at least a little part of MY life?

20090308052656AAFNc3G	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do you feel in a relationship when he or she takes you for granted?	I've been going out with this girl for the past two months who was alright the first month. She really liked me and whatnot and I was nice enough to buy her a large stuffed bear for V-Day. The past several months I've been going to her house to hang out.      Long story short, I got pissed because she took me for granted, and the last time she really texted me was to ask for myspace pic comments. The thing that really pissed me off was that she decided to break things off but instead of letting me off by actually telling me, she didn't say a word and listed herself as single on facebook, which I think is very low.      So am I wrong to be pissed about this or what?

I broke up with him 2 weeks ago.      I miss him so much it hurts. I can't fall asleep, all I've done is cry and cry and cry. Everyone thinks I'm obsessed and pathetic, but they've never been in my position.      I've tried talking to him a couple times. Not about us, just in general. But he keeps on ignoring me. It KILLS inside.      You're gonna think, "oh, she's only 13, what does she know about this stuff?" Stop the stereotypes.      I'm scared that I've been so used to my mistakes being fixed that I thought that this one could be just in case. I'm also scared that I broke my own heart.      All I've been thinking about is the memories we've had and what I could have done different in the relationship itself.      I can't stop regretting all of my decisions. What can I do?

I dont talk to him in school cos we have different friends and share none of the same classes.    one night i was out with my friend and she knows i like him, anyway she went up to him saying stuff like 'you should kiss her'...but he said he was seeing someone...(he wasnt seeing anyone at the party before btw)  but my friend was kinda drunk and kept on saying it and she said he was thinking about it...but at that point i was like to my friend 'what are you doing'. so i ruined it. :(   but now every time im out..he always comes up and says hi, and ruffles my hair and stuff! so im so confused!!!   I don't talk to him in school ever, we just walk past each other and its really getting to me!!!! do you think he likes me or not.?      thanks
20090307222938AAfaIyg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A girl just texted "Come over. My roommates aren't here". But I'm a virgin what should I do?!?	Ok, so this girl I've been flirting with the past semester on campus (I am in college) and and this semester has texted "Come over. My roommates aren't here". I ran into her at a party earlier this evening and I had just left the party, and I got the text a little time after I got home. I'm a little buzzed, but I don't know her status. She's really really good looking and I like her a lot (I've fantasized a couple of times about her). And I've heard from one or two guys that's she's definitely not a virgin for sure. But I'm a virgin and I have no idea what to do if "something" does happen. Should I go over there and possibly embarrass myself just to have one night of fun, or should I tell her I'm tired and want to go to bed? Any girls or guys want to give me advice on this situation it would help out a lot. Thanks.

20090307230302AATALzl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My good friend's girlfriend...?	Well, I have a friend of about four years who's going out with this girl. He's treated her badly (dating another girl, texting another girl saying that he liked her better, etc.) but she seems to just stay with him. So one day in class she asked for my phone and put her number in, we talked the next day. Before this, we had barely said a word to each other. This was about a month ago, and we've talked for hours everyday since then. Now we've admitted that we like each other, and I already feel rather guilty. But I mean, hey, you can't decide who you like, it just happens. It's starting to feel weird to talk to my friend, or even see them together, and I don't know what to do. Another problem: if and when they break up, should I even go out with her? If so, for how long should I wait. If not, what should I do about my feelings for her? He's not all that close of a friend, so I don't know which way to go. Talking to him could jeaprodize my friendship!

20090307234654AArJkda	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can I get a womans point of view?	She is a family friend and I've known her for years. I was good friends with her brothers but lately I've re-connected with them, and gotten closer to her. When I saw her 2 years ago I sent her mail which she replied, and asked me to write back, which I didn't I was busy at the time.      Then 3 months ago I went to visit her again we went out a few times and she had a good time, picked flowers and gave them to me. She tells in the past she'd cry because she was so lonely and had no one and last in her family to get married. We went to her place so I can fix her computers I didn't make my moves. I think I respect her brother too much. I live pretty far away for work. When I decided to send her roses and mail to tell her I didn't write back before cos I was busy, and I want to continue where we left off, she tell me she has a boyfriend who has been divorced and has kids so she can't tell her parents yet. She then tells me if there is anything she can do for me to ask, and ends mail in see you next time. Since she says she has a bf, and I have met him (he works with her) I'd like to forget about her but I've known her so long and I love her - why didn't she mention this when we went out? Is she making it up to see my reaction? It's been two months since. I've fallen and don't know what to do next..

Can I start dating other people and call myself separated? Do I have to tell him if I date someone? I already told him that he could date if he wants and I may date.      Thank you for your response.
20090308001948AA1wS62	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i get over my hatred of women?	Ok i know i have a problem with women over the years due to not getting dates when asking them out, or hanging out with women when i ask to just lets go to the movies, so now i am just so fed up with them not giving me a chance and dont careless for them.. Anyways, last week i was with a friend who acrouse is a jerk to his girlfriend, i was driving them home from school and they started arguing in the back seat to the point when he started to hit her in the face a couple of times and broke her nose it really didn't faze me as i didn't even turn around to help her as she cried and was kicking and screaming, because i just didnt give a damn about women at the time. And there was another time where i was walking home from the fun park and saw a guy, which i know i would beat him to death with me being 6'8 258 pounds and him very small hitting and kicking his girlfriend because she locked the key in the car. He basically beat her into the ground as i just passed by and look and kept on walking with saying anything because i just didnt care about saving her and watching this Rihanna crap i guess it is true that women like jerks, so should i continue being a jerk and not payin attention to women getting their butts beat to death? I dont care, they are the ones choosing these losers so they get with they deserve. Thats how i feel about it..
20090308003814AAtXu7b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: Would you go to a dance if a girl asked you but you didn't reallllly like her and you were only friends.?	So I want to ask a guy to a formal for my sorority but I don't want to get rejected and we are working together on a project so if he does say no it could make the rest of the semester awkward. I want to make it sound like we can just go as friends and I want to mention that I was going to bring my roommate (we can bring female friends if we can't get dates) but stuff came up (true story). Will that make him feel like a second pick and will he not like that (would you not like that)? We always laugh and he thinks I'm funny and "enjoyable" to work with but we never hang out outside of the project. If you were this guy would you say yes? (Also it's not like any other girl would ask him because he doesn't know anyone else in the sorority). And would you like me to make it sound like we would only be going as friend?      Gosh I'm 18 I should know how to do this already! haha

20090307223931AA2iQMF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have her back, or am I just a fool?	Forgive me, this is a little long... I have several questions so please try to answer as many of them as you can.      So me and my current ex have been broken up for about 3 months now. She broke up with me because I said something stupid that made her feel that I was afraid of her. Which I'm not. Ever since then I've noticed we still have feelings for each other, however she won't admit it so easily.      She's currently dating another guy that she's already dated once before. His name is Chris. Chris doesn't treat her right. He basically acts like he owns her, he lies to her, and he's made fake promises for her. For example, he promised he'd quit smoking because of her asthma, and so far he hasn't even tried. He also has a tendency to dump his stress on her, by talking about how "dramatic" his life has been lately.      Well, just last Sunday, something unexpected happened. Me and Megan were at the mall just hanging out, we got McDonalds, and she started feeling REALLY dizzy and she decided she wanted to lay down. I also started noticing that her speech was slurred. I walked her down to one of the couches and sat her down, she collapsed onto the couch and mall security got on our case for it so we had to leave and go to a park nearby.      It was a hassle getting her there, she kept falling over and I had to carry her the rest of the way. There were a group of three kids there that were all worried about her. After I kept telling them it was gonna be okay, they still called 911 and they left just before the paramedics arrived.      See, I have a mental disorder called dysthymia(sp?) and it makes it hard for me to think on my feet, so i didn't call 911 cause i kept thinking she was going be okay. But I couldn't have been more wrong. The paramedics called her parents, they arrived and gave her a ride to the hospital. She found out that her medicines were destroying her liver and that she needed to be taken off of some of them.      A day later I called her, just to see how she was doing. Usually when I call her on the phone she tries to get me off the phone as soon as possible. I kept insisting that she needed to get some rest but she kept pushing herself to stay awake and talk to me. She kept thanking me for everything I did and telling me how grateful she was that I was there. She even started crying but tried to hold it back.      The next day i heard she missed school again so I brought her a get well soon card and some flowers with the little money i had left. When I arrived I was surprised to find that her dad had warmed up to me. She came outside and even though she was tired and loopy she pushed herself to keep talking to me.      Over the next week, she missed everyday of school. Chris waited until 3 days into the week when someone finally told him that she was sent to the hospital that he suddenly decided to finally call and check up on her. He's mad at me because he thinks i did something to her.      Then today came, she was cheery than normal and was feeling a lot better. We ended up going out to get something to eat and she was just so happy to be with me today. Her diet has to change because of her liver and I kept pushing myself to remember all the things I had to have taken off of her taco when it was ordered. And she seemed impressed which was weird.      Then she started getting cold and she wanted to go home. So i walked her home (neither one of us drive) and before she went in I unfolded one of many letters i have written her since we had broken up. This was the latest one. I read it to her and she was silent all the way through it. After the letter i told her to look at me and her eyes were really teary but she was trying to hold it back. And I couldn't hold back the tears, i couldn't help it. She kept telling me not to cry. She suddenly told me that she was tired and her stomach was bugging her and she wanted to go inside and lay down. She had this weird expression on her face, it was so strange. Before she went in she handed me the last of the food she didn't finish at Taco John's and went inside. I told her I loved her and she said "I know."      When I was outside walking home I saw a random patch of grass and I took a picture of it and sent it to her cause it made me think of her. In the middle of the desert a patch of grass is a beautiful thing.      What I also know is that ever since the breakup she's been trying to tell herself that she doesn't deserve me. And I told her I know that that's how she feels and when I ask her why she keeps telling me "I don't know, Randy". If it wasn't true I know she'd tell me, that's the way she is.      So what I need help with is what I should do next. And I also need to know why she's all of a sudden being so crazy about me. I've also been giving her days where she doesn't talk to me at all. Why have her parents suddenly warmed up to me when they used to hate me? and why does she insist on dating Chris when she still has feelings for me? I just... I need some answers

20090307223712AAt5EvO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I don't know how to read this girl...?	I'm afraid I'm over thinking the things that she's doing... for some reason, I guess I can't accept the fact that she might just be a shy girl toward guys like me she doesn't know in the hopes that she might have a thing for me. I've liked her almost since the beginning of the school year, we sit right next to each other in history class... Here are some things I've noticed, all MIXED:      -When another friend and I used to talk, she tried to enter our conversations, but we always sort of shrugged her off because she's really quiet and we didn't know if she had actually said anything   -She spends a lot of attention on me when my friend and I talk (could be that she's just interested in the convo, though); she'll consistently do it though   -She'll text a lot during the lecture   -Every time I walk up the row, she'll be staring at me like if I'm walking back to my seat after throwing something away   -However, a few times, she's even glared at me for some reason :x (trust me, we sit next to each other, she doesn't have eye issues)   -Whenever I actually turn my head in her direction to look at the teacher, she isn't looking at me and gets sort of squirmy (I guess I Would too, if a girl I Didn't know started doing that)            So...any insight? Am I probably just over thinking everything and mistaking her for just an ordinary human being? the glaring thing that's going on is throwing me off a bit and making me discouraged   We've spoken before, but it was only polite talk and school-related...

20090308003509AA0E9pI	Family & Relationships;Friends	Help! Confused, lonely (but not), head is spinning, What's going on!?	Oh my god, Im so confused right now. Im a thirteen year old girl and am going through a really wierd phase. I'm doing pretty well in school and im enjoying it and everything, Im an only child, but i have loads of friends in school but all of a sudden, I have noticed that I am feeling this wierd sense of isolation and desperate loneliness.      I'm the kind of person who's always quite interested in other peoples problems etc. not only cause by helping them you feel a sense of being a "do-gooder', but also because you can learn how other people feel about things a learn from this yourslef. I always try to be an open person and have one of my main priorities as always looking at both sides of a situation. Now, all of a sudden, its like I have all of these "issues" of my own, and its making my head spin.      Suddenly I feel like that saying "You can be in a room full of people, but still be all alone". I feel that I know myself really well, and in that sense I'm quite grounded, but now, it feels like thats ALL i have, and that no one else is there.      I've always wanted to have a best friend, someone who will always be there for me and someone who I can be really close with. I do have a group of close friends, but it kinda feels like if I wasnt there, sure they'd be a little upset, but my absense wouldnt really phase them that much. No one really cares that much, as long as there's a group to go to. It's like, my friends only ring me when they're bored and have nothing better to do. I feel like such a loner, even though, in reality I'm not.      Over the past two weeks I have been noticing that gradually I'm becoming really sad and isolated. But the wierd thing is, my mind kind of Wants to be sad... I don't know, its all so confusing.      Im the kind of person who always embraces the little joys of life and is happy in them, but recently a part of me is trying to covince the rest of me that all of that passion is a load of cr@p. I'm so alone, all by myself, so lonely, and it's not right.      What should I do? Thanks so much for all of your help.
20090308002441AAWvN6I	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need to know how to be nice about it?	well today my boyfriend wanted to know if he proposed to me would i say yes. well i would but there's a big problem. he is not ready for marriage. he's been layed off from work and is now living at home. if i were to say yes i feel that there is nothing he could offer me right now. im currently living at home as well but i am also a student and paying rent to my grandma for staying here. i feel i would be better off with us the way we are now. i just cant put up with the pressures of having a husband right now and besides i feel that i am too young. i need to know how to let him know all of this without coming off rude or hurting his feelings. i love him but right now just isnt the right time. maybe when his living situation is better but not now. what should i do or say? he also doesnt seem to be looking for another job.
20090308004222AADSoF0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How old are most boys the first time a girl kicks them in the balls?	I asked this before in gender studies - but boy was that a bunch of troll responses! anyway, i have a 12 year old cousin, and he's in a bind. In an effort to keep his friends laughing, and basically on a dare, he grabbed this girl's chest and ran off after he got off the bus. his older sister talks to the girl's sister, and the girl was mortified and very upset, but was cheered up by the suggestion by the older sister that she could kick him in the balls for it. so that's her plan.      ack!      so now its become this big thing - like, i think its going to be the first time almost any of them actually see a girl kick a boy in the balls. so its snowballing - and my cousin is approaching it all wrong. he's not worried enough or mentally prepared for what it'd be like if she does it. he's more like, bring it on. its kind of sad because its obvious he's never had his nuts hit by anything.      so what should i say to him? i think the kid deserves it to some degree - but its kind of insane, too. its like, he's become the guinee pig for a bunch of girls who were told by a teenager about kicking boys in the balls. and how old is old enough? i mean, i happens to alot of boys - but he seems young for it. you think theres a point where a kid is too young to psychological process it? i guess i feel protective of him, but at the same time frustrated he put himself in this position and isn't approaching it with the proper seriousness.
20090308005037AAhUze6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My bf's ex girlfriend claims she's  pregnant with his baby?	I've been seeing this guy for about a month and a half and his ex girlfriend claimed she was pregnant a few days ago with his baby, she said she's about 6 weeks pregnant. Today apparently she started bleeding, meaning she would be having a miscarriage, and apparently she went to the doctor and he referred her to get a ultrascan tomorow. But until then this guy is still worried. I secretely think he wanted the baby.. anyways, I think she could by lieing to get his attention, as she could easily be having a period and just say she went to the doctor... The pregnancy wasn't confirmed until today when she saw the doctor about the bleeding... she's been drinking alot (which i think she is soo stupid for)... and somehow i just find this all very hard to believe... Maybe she is really pregnant but i doubt it's his baby, unless he's lying to me... I'm just so torn with this, i have my own oppinions and i have told him but he still feels sorry for her... I know he's just being a good person, by wanting to support her through this, but i think she's trying to get between me and him... Before this all happened me and him were very serious.. and when i found out I told him I wanted out because i felt really out of place, but he begged me to give him a second change.       I just need some oppinions on this, what would you do in this situation? Run for the hills? Or stay and support him (And his ex)
20090307231622AAkB73W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GF is pregnant by another man, won't call me, owes me $$$?	My ex-GF lost her job and I helped her out financially. I gave her $3,500 in cash and she charged $9,000 on my credit card.      She and I were best friends before we became involved and she always told people that I had "always been there for her."      But now, she can't even find the time to make a phone call. We broke up b/c she cheated and became pregnant but her babydaddy wants nothing to do with her.      Why can't she make a phone call? Is it b/c she's selfish? She also slept with her sister's husband, which led to a divorce.      What should I do? I don't really want the $ back but I'd appreciate a phone call b/c we ended on bad terms and I'd like to end the beef between us. I called her and she won't return my calls. It's been almost 9 months now.      Should I curse her out? Or just walk away and forget she was ever in my life?

Well, this girl asked me for the sadies hawkins dance at our school. She seemed really happy when i accepted. She once liked me and i did too but we came to a conclusion that it would be better if we just remained as friends. Well, the other day my friends at the hospital voulunteer with her and have heard that she is still very much into me. But then again yesterday, my friend told me that she had second thoughts about her being with me at the dance. She said that i might just talk to her rather than dancing. I really know how to dance and i still like her very much. Also, she said i was a sweet guy and that i was a guy that is really hard to find. I just need to know what to do. Should i go, or should i just make a lame excuse and skipp it. I have already bought my ticket and i tried so very hard to buy hers but the school wanted her present with her id. She also said she will buy her own, but she felt flattered when i said i tried this. I still like her. What should i do please answer as much as possible.      oh yah, should i call and ask her does she really want to go to the dance with me or just forget about it. I dont iknow if she will chnage her mind for another person. The dance is 5 days from now

20090308002858AAi9YEF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i start to talk to her?	this girl in my class, which i really like. i want to get to know her and hopefully ask her to hang out and go from there.      here's the problem. she's always busy, even when i message her on myspace, she doesn't reply but when she sees me then she tells me the answer. also told me that she only goes to myspace just to pass time so i think im going to stop messaging her.      we sit apart in class and also before and after class, there is no chance for me to talk to her as she walks out and goes to other class and i go home.       from what i've seen she's pretty cool and my type of girl.      so the question is HOW DO I START A CONVERSATION WITH HER AND MAYBE SPEND SOME TIME WITH HER DURING SCHOOL.   btw i'm good with girls and always make them laugh.
20090308050115AAHwdpU	Family & Relationships;Friends	What's wrong with a moment of silence in conversation?	My friend seems really bothered by any moment of silence in a conversation whether between two people or a group of people. She always tries to keep the conversation going, and if there are signs of it stopping she immediately changes topic to something completely random, for example something funny that happened years ago that is really pointless to talk about now. And then if the conversation DOES stop despite her valiant efforts for more than 1 second, she just has to say "Wow it is quiet again ... SOOOOO" and it's so damn annoying!      I mean - I understand that sometimes silent moments can be awkward but no conversation on Earth can go NON-STOP FOREVER like she wants it to! I wish I could keep coming up with replies but sometimes I can't and once I am at a loss for words I just know that her "it's so quiet now" line is just around the corner!       Is this a problem of hers, or am I being stupid and over-reacting?

20090308004837AA7qyjC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I confront somebody who talke S*** behind my back.?	There is this is i used to like in high school but ever since we all graduated shes turned into a real *****. She likes to talk about ppl behind their back. One day me, her, some friends, and my sister all hung out. But then later that night when we were all leaving she had the nerve to talk about me behind my back TO MY SISTER! She basically said how she thinks i was acting lame that night, that didn't bother me but what did bother me was that she was talking crap about how all the friends I had with me were white (im black by the way). That pissed me off, so of course my sister told me and i confronted her, she gave me a bullshit excuse so i let it go. A few weeks later i heard she had a b-day party and she asked this guy who likes my sister "why do you like her she isn't even that cute". He told my sister and she told me. It didn't bother my sister because she knows shes prettier so she isn't gonna waste her time, but it pissed me the hell off. My sister asked me not to confront her, so i didn't. Me and the girl still talk every noww and then but every time we talk she ends up pissing me off without even knowing it. She'll end up saying something insulting but i wont show it. Now i could just ingore this person and just avoid talking to her from now on but since i used to like this girl and shes pissed me off a lil too often i feel compelled to confront her. Should I?

20090307225434AAnUGg8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We just broke up yesterday...but his birthday is coming up?	We've been dating for almost three years now, but this week was a very difficult week for both of us and so we decided to break up. But his birthday is coming up next week. I already bought him his present, but should I give it to him and wish him a happy birthday? Should I even go to his birthday party next week? He's still an amazing guy and he deserve the best birthday. But I'm not sure what I should do - what will produce the best outcome, do you think?
20090307224850AAQsCxb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I made a complete fool of myself in front of him: help me undo it!?	OK. Well, basically, I had a tiny crush on this guy, but then I started to think of him more seriously. We texted every day, but he suddenly stopped and I had no idea why. So the next day during algebra he goes up to me and says hi- but I start blushing like a tomato for no apparent reason, out of the blue, and I say really awkwardly and seriously,   "You're not allowed to talk to me."   Like, dead seriously. Though it was supposed to be a joke.   So he answers,   "What?"   And I say,   "You don't text me anymore." With a straight face.   Ahhh and I looked so stupid. He says, "I broke my phone but I got a new number."   And then I nod, then he goes to his seat. It was completely mortifying.   Now he barely ever talks to me anymore!! What can I do to get his phone number in a casual way? (Keep in mind I may be a weird nervous person when I am saying it... lol) And how can I regain our close relationship we had?
20090308000229AArdqSy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls should answer this....do you think this guy deserved a second chance!?	There's this story I know about a guy who met this girl online.Both juniors in high school. They talked to eachother like EVERY day, either through phone (six hours straight once), texting, IM or webcam. He is a poet in way because he enjoys the hobby of writing poetry about specific events in his life, because he feels that writing about them will cause him to one day find out who he REALLY is inside. Him and this girl talked to eachother all the time and they started liking eachother. He wrote her poems that she liked a lot and she always made fun of him in a teasingly way, and it went on for about 3 and a half months. They knew eachother quite well after awhile. She lived in LA and he lived about 1300 miles away from her, unfortunately. But he asked her out anyway since he knew that he would be able to see her when he went to visit his grandparents who lived near her. She agreed to it, but kept teasing him, saying she never agreed (thats the humor she had, lol). She had to travel for two hours to see him, but she wanted to, so she did. He was COMPLETELY nervous about it since he has never done something like that, getting to know someone so well and then finally seeing them in person.   The time they spent together didn't go so well for two different reasons: 1) The date was kindof controlled because she had a time limit and he didn't get to do the things he really wanted to do to with her. 2) He is normally a pretty shy person, but he knows how to be outgoing with people he knows real well, but he couldn't be his real self when he was just SO nervous about the whole thing and the situation. Basically, because of these two reasons, he didn't get to really return the "investment" that was being saved up all that time getting to know eachother, the date was not as satisfying and it was brought to a bad closing. She ended up telling him later that she didn't really feel a connection and just wanted to be friends, and she also blocked his IM, probably because she knew he still liked her and it would be difficult to continue talking to someone you just had some interesting feelings for. That's where the grief came in for him. Here he wanted to just not talk to her and give her LOTS of space and time to heal the wound that had just happened. He traveled back to his hometown and went through immense grief because of it, having lost such a great friend like that and not attempting to talk to her again since he felt it would only make things bad to make contact so soon again. Thats where the idea of his "journey" came into his mind. This girl changed him in a big way, changed his outlook on life I guess you can say. He normally lived a life with not so interesting people in his small town and has never had someone like her come into his life like that, and you can get an idea of the sense of loss he felt after she was gone. He's always had the notion of wanting to travel places and see a lot more of the world when he got older, especially once he became a legal adult at 18. He decided he was going to try and talk to her again but decided to wait a long while before doing so and when he did, he wanted to let her know how much she affected him. SEVEN months went by without any contact and he suddenly turned 18. That is when he contacted her, and he kept his message very short and simple: He told her he was writing a book and wanted to know if she'd be interested to read some of it.    The book he was writing was about his life in general and how some things in his life had affected him (keep in mind, he wasn't looking to publish it or anything big, he was just looking to write something special to himself) and she of course, said that she would like to read some of it, sure. But then he put in motion a "journey" that he had planned for quite a LONG time, all the way since about a month after he returned from california. He was going to go biking through a part of the country, which was something he wanted to do for a good portion of his whole life. He always thought that getting out there in the world in such a big way like that would make him, a good way to describe it would be, to "find himself" out there in the world. But he could only do it once he turned 18, because then he would be considered an adult. So right after he sent her that quick message and verifying if she'd like to read it, he left home and biked for 1300 miles. He wrote poems and in his journal about his experiences and once he got there, he stopped by, handed her the book, talked to her about what made the date go wrong and told her he wanted to spend the time he wanted to spend with her. He also didn't finish the book, as the "blank" parts of it were supposed to be written by HER, as obviously he was leaving it up to HER on how the story would end. Good things happened from there, but do you think he was deserving of a second chance because of this?

20090308000738AAsqFeZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to forget about a boy when you really, really like him, but doesn't have a chance to be with?	So I have this crush on my senior - he's quite handsome, smart, athletic, a vice president in the Student Council, and is funny too. I never really talk to him, and I don't remember having a conversation with him too, so I thought that this is just kind of those "fan girl" crush. I started liking him when we (along with my other Student Council friends and the ex-Student Councils) were having some workshop about being a good leader. He's so funny and I can't help but noticing him and laughing at every joke he made.      That's when I realized that I like him (first love -__-')      After the workshop was over, I off course told my friends about him, and they were excited that I finally turns in to a girl (cause I never really got in to their talk about boys and clothes lol). But, a week after, the seniors know that I like him, and that is a big problem for me. You see, my crush is like, one of the A-list in his gang, and it doesn't take a genius to spot that his friends would make my life horrible.      That's why I started to lie about who I really like, and I told them that I like this new, totally safe guy from another school. It's working out pretty good, and I can admire him from afar as long as I want to. Off course, the senior still has doubts that I like the fake boy, so I can't really MSN him like I would (curse whoever leak my secret!), but it's fine with me, as long as no one gets hurt.      But then, on the 14th of February, he got himself the perfect girlfriend (wow would you look at that, it's Valentine -__-'). When someone told me this, I'm not surprised to see myself as calm as before. I always knew I can't have him, since he barely knows my name, and we haven't talk or anything. That thought made me strong - at least, until Monday comes along.      I saw him with his girlfriend which was athletic, smart, and beautiful, and my tears started to melt. So here I am, 96 hours later, still wet and red from crying and can't get him out off my mind.      My question is How to forget about him and bear his sight with his girlfriend? I've got tests coming out and I don't want to weep and feel sorry for myself, because I know it's stupid to cry over someone that you know you won't get. I tried everything, from having a girl's night out to eating 4 chocolate bars a day, but I can't seem to make this pain go away (hey that rhymes lol!)      Please help, and thank you very much,   Katasha

20090308000828AAPphAd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	For Women only: What does it mean when a woman says that she is not interested....Read details prior to answer?	This question is for women of any age preferably 18 and up, please answer honestly.      What does it mean for a women when she says to a man that she is not interested ?      Would she say the same if the man was physically attractive ?      For my point of view as a man, if i say to a women that i am not interested is mostly because in the first place i dont find her attractive, in other words i won't say to a attractive women that i am not interested. Is this the same case for women ? Generally speaking.      Would you says to an attractive man that you are not interested ? even tough you are single ?      Therefore if the man is physically attractive to you would you "automatically" be interested ?      Could you not be interested in him even tough he is attractive and a great communicator ?      I think you understand my question by now, basically i want a general point of view from women (single or not) what you generally mean by " iam not interested" based on what mostly...looks? For men i believe its is mostly on looks.      Thank you in advance.

20090307225233AAqVvtW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	*Need some guy/sex advice!*?	Okay...Here is my story.............Me & this guy (we will call him Steve) have known eachother for YEARS. Since grade-school. We are both 22..We never really "dated" but we have always stayed in touch and hung out every once and a while.      Lately we've been hanging out more..he'll spend the night at my house or I'll spend the night at his. He has never pushed himself on me at all, & all we have ever done is kiss. But last weekend he asked me if I wanted to come stay the night and watch a movie so I said yes. Well one thing led to another and next thing I know we are naked (LOL) ..I ask him what he wants to do and he says "Well, I don't care but we probably shouldn't have sex yet"....      But I realllly wanted to..so I slipped it in, then he starts pushing me off because he is about to come. Then I ask him if everything is OK and he has the LAMEST excuse that he needs to go out to his car..clearly because he is getting a condom...so he comes back and has the condom...puts it on...puts it in...and I **** you not three "in & outs" later his junk goes LIMP!!! I asked him if he came and he said no.      I said..."umm are you ok??"...He said he hadn't had sex in a year and a HALF!! So..I turn over and go to sleep....He asked me if we would hang out again and seemed anxious.      So..............2 days pass..I still don't hear from him..so I text him and say something like "Can't talk to anyone, asshole!"...he texts back the next day and says "Hey! Sorry I lost my phone"......& every other day he'll say like "whats up" or something!       What I want to know is if I may have done something?? Did he lie when he said he didn't come?? Is he not talking to me as much because he is embaressed of himself?? I want to try it again with him but he's not COMMUNICATING! What should I do???

20090307230906AA3kGdb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is wrong with girls?	I don't get it... do girls deliberately date assholes? I don't get it, i'm an incredibly nice guy, outgoing, mature, tall, good looking :) i wear nice clothes, play sports (well lol), in great shape, good hygiene, great listener, nice to everyone, don't judge, sweet, romantic, thoughtful, sorry if i sound conceited =/  but a lot of girls tell me they see me more as a friend then they go out with douchebags who treat them like crap or cheat on them... i also don't do "stuff" with just random girls, and most girls know certain guys do that but pretend they don't mind, or say that's bad but then date them anyway... i know how to have fun at parties and with friends but i don't try to put moves on every girl i meet.

He lives about two and a half hours away so i dont get to see him too often. And he his busy a lot and i feel the need to constantly call and text. And he doesnt answer most of the time and i start to feel really paranoid. And i know not to text "are you mad at me?" because that is ultra clingy. I am 15 so i know it is not this huge love thing, but i really like him and he said he really likes me and wants to go out, but wants to get to know me better (we've known each other about 2 months). And so basically, what should i do to not be so attatched because when he hasnt called or texted i feel so alone and abandoned cause i feel that he is the one, and i have never felt this way, so any help?

If my other friend does then he win money and the girl.       I want to beat him, but I know that she is not interested in me because I was insulting her and yelling at her when she tried to talk to me or help me with my work.

20090308051354AAfpJEA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	In a first time relationship and...?	I'm quite physically shy I guess. It took me a few years before I became comfortable hugging/being hugged by my best friends. I'm not that bad anymore though. I've told him this.      We've been going out since november (I went home for the summer holidays though so only chatted to him through msn for three months).      So I like hugs and all that, but kissing is kinda weird and I'm wigging out because I'm letting him and probably thinking too much. I'm overly self conscious and it's incredibly stupid and I feel kinda bad for being newby and slow  at this. Any advice >:?
20090308051413AA50w5R	Family & Relationships;Friends	Played by my BEST friend. Help?	My best friend is also my ex. The thing is I never truely stopped loving him. Recently, he's been acting as though he wants to get back together too, talking me to meet his family (the only girl he's ever taken home), to romantic walks in the park and asking me to be his Valentine. He even kisses my hand while we're holding hands in the movies, and just generally acting like we were together. His family and friends too think we're a couple.   The thing is last night was his birthday party, and although we spent the entire night before together talking, all of his friends present were girls who I have never met before, and we barely spoke the entire night. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, seeing as it was his birthday and since his family was also present, he had his fair share of commitments and whatever, but I'm pretty sure he hooked up with another girl. I don't know what to do. I'm completely heart broken but since we weren't OFFICIALLY dating, there isn't much I can do. I really love him, and would do anything for him to be with me again. Can anyone please help me, I don't know how to get him back.

20090308053510AAYmhuO	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What does she do? Does she stay with her the love of her life or respect her parents feelings?	My best friend who is muslim is in a relationship with a sikh boy. They have been together for over a year now and they are just madly in love. They are very compatible and perfect for each other. They want to spend the rest of their lives together. However my friend's parents will not agree to them getting married and she doesnt want to loose him. She is also concerned about hurting her parents and don't want to loose them either. What can they do to be together? They need each other.   Well he is 26 and she is 22 so not so young and they are very practical about the situation but really cannot live without each other. Also most of his friends have left from here so he is quite alone. Sometimes she feels guilty because of her he is staying back and not going back to india to his family and where most of his friends are. She is supportive of any decision he will make however she doesnt want to loose him. Her parents will be devasted and will disown her. Do you really believe that eventually things will be ok?   They are both very ambitious and have passion for the same things in life. His parents will not be very accepting but there is more chance of them accepting it sooner. However her parents will be completely against it and they have worked so hard all their lives for her and her siblings it will not be a very nice way to repay them or show gratefulness by hurthing them.
20090308054823AA4k8dJ	Family & Relationships;Family	Unbelievably strict parent - is this normal?	(I don't think what my parent does is normal - but outside opinions would be really helpful.)      For example - If my sibling asks to play hockey outside, and after playing hockey for awhile, decides to play with a football or frisbee, they get in huge trouble and are lectured for hours and not allowed to play outside because they are untrustworthy, dishonest, disobedient, sneaking behind the parent's back, etc. Or if they go rollerblading with friends and later switch to riding bikes, or say they are playing soccer and decide to play tag, etc.      Example 2: My one sibling (18 yrs old) dyes their hair all the time - nothing drastic, just different shades of blond or brown, since their natural hair color is rather dull and they like to make it look nice. They've been doing this for about 7 years. And they still must ask permission every single time, and are not allowed to change their hair color without informing the parent days and preferably a week in advance, because the parent doesn't like surprises and it is inconsiderate to change their hair without 'warning' them first.      Example 3 - One sibling has a horse they bought with their own money, and they work to pay for all it's care. If, for example, they've only done one page of math homework one night (because the math problems are very hard and it's taking them longer), they're threatened to have their horse taken away. This threat is used for everything, from the sibling not getting the dishes done on time, to not wanting to come to a public function they find boring, etc - it's always 'if you don't do this I'll sell you horse'. My sibling loves that horse more than anything in the world and they compete together and the parent absolutely literally controls everything they say, think, or do by threatening constantly to sell the horse over the most trivial things. Sibling is literally a mental wreck trying to be perfect enough to keep their horse.      Example 4: One sibling had to give a WEEK's notice before hanging out with a friend. Their friend couldn't just call up and ask to hang out that day or the next day or a few days from now. And if a friend called and sibling wanted to give them an answer, parent would make them wait up to half an hour or more before answering because they 'hadn't finished thinking yet' or 'didn't know yet' all the while the friend's hanging on the line waiting for an answer. Sibling was never allowed to stay over at friend's houses even in high school.      Example 6: Sibling was not allowed to be at work if only one other employee was on that day and was a member of the opposite sex.Parent was sure that sibling would be up to all kinds of nefarious activity if ever left alone with a member of the opposite sex. Absolutely freaked out and demanded he had to leave work immediately. Yet parent accuses sibling of being gay all the time. Sibling is straight, and follows abstinence-till-marraige, and is 100% sober and clean, yet parent is always convinced sibling is out having sex or doing drugs. Also, though sibling is 18 he must call and let parent know where he is at all times. If he makes an unexpected stop during an errands run to say, get gas, he has to phone and let parent know, otherwise he is untrustworthy, lying, and sneaking around behind their back. Their rationale is that when sibling gets married and has a spouse they will have to let them know all the time where they are so spouse doesn't get suspicious and think they're cheating; therefore sibling might as well get used to doing it now.      Example 7: Sometimes we are not even allowed to step out onto our front porch or go to the basement or to our rooms without informing parent of where in the house we are planning on going. Because they claim that parents should always know where their children are, and that it's rude to 'disappear' in the house without letting everyone know where you are, and we shouldn't be just 'going off' without checking first.      Okay, this is getting really long. Thanks for reading through it all. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Honestly, is it just me or is my parent bordering on unbalanced? I think they're totally irrational, but they always have these huge excuses for everything they're doing, and make us out to all be 'rebellious' because we don't agree with their million unbelievable rules.
20090308061130AAfyN34	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really stuffed up, please help me!?	Hey guys.      Well, my best guy friend was really into this girl who we both went to school with but she was very shy, so she would never tell him how she felt. My guy friend and I both wanted to know how she was feeling. I had the silly idea of using one of my old msn adresses and a fake person's name to try and find out how she felt.       I started chatting on msn with her and soon she started opening up to me. I found out that she really liked him, but also some really personal stuff. Without thinking, I happily chatted away with her and comforted her with her problems.       Very soon after that, she began to think of me as a real online friend and now she really wants my number, so she can talk to me on the phone.       Of course, I can't give her any phone number because the person I'm pretending to be doesn't exist. To make things worse, we don't get on at all in real life at all. I'm sorry if this is all very confusing.      I know I was VERY silly to do what I did :(       Does anyone have any ideas on how I can "get out" of this sticky situation? I can't even giver her my real number and pass it off as my fake online personality, because she has my number already from a year ago when we used to be friends.      She wants to talk and txt me!       How can I make things better for myself?      I can't tell her! That would be so embarassing and the whole school would know and ridicule me :)      Please help!      Thanks xx

20090308063521AATBrNy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do when he texts me this at 1am?	I'm a sophomore in college.      the guy ive been dating for almost a month came an slept over last night. we didnt do anything we just slept lol he was sweet. BUT THEN tonight i knew he had been drinking since 7pm. at midnight he told me he was about to pass out. he had been texting me all night and he was going to sleep. THen at 1AM he sends me this: yo i just wanted u to kno that i still sleep with and hang out with my ex gf and im not looking 4 nething serious.      first of all he is very drunk.   second of all, that is not how he texts me, like he never says yo or uses abreviations   so i started to think maybe he was really drunk and they were about to hook up so he sent that.   or maybe he passed out and his ex typed that   or maybe someone who wanted to get back at him texted      my other guy friend mike texted me once that he and his gf broke up and it was horrible when he was really drunk at 2am.      then when we talked in the morning he said it never happened.      so maybe guys just send crazy stuff really drunk?      or maybe he's an jerk      i dont kno y he would take me to the movies, still talk about wanting to take me out like just yesterday, come sleep in my room, tell me to visit him over spring break, and tell me to visit him over the summer 3 times, and then do this??

Ok, I had this friend(girl) we started hanging out about 4 yeas ago we got very close, not intimate but close enough to most people thought we were always asked....anywayi went away 2 school , we had issues, we became fiends again, more issues (me being possesive @$$, i was drunk had no right consdierng we werent dating). saw other people, became single again, i sent her flowers told her how i felt, then i got drunk we got into fight a dont rmeember, basicallyi was an *** and shes started seeing someone else over over a year ago i saw her out once and she had a big smile and looked like she wanted to talk..i didnt say anything, i really couldnt just be friends again.i didnt try contacting her except her birthday then i see she has blocked me on aim, is letting my facebo0k request just sit there...so everytime she signs on it says 1 new friend request since i noticed that ive seen her twice one time she we caught eyes fro far away and we siled then last tie i was close and said hi she gave me a phney baloney smile and i just kept walking...thats really shady, whats up wth her? I can see mabye why she blocked me but why after months of no contact? its not like i was emailing, iming or stalkin her anything like that. she was prtty much out of mind until this blocking got my attention. i mean we havent really talked in over a year why would she be mad now? i mean she could have just delclines the friend request. I really didnt try contacting for so long so i dont understand the blocking, especially so long after our last arguement? I mean all the drama had long come and gone before i got blocked
20090308064717AAEqcjU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Sex problems with boyfriend?	Ok, please no jokey answers. I have been with a new boyfriend for a few months now, and we have a good relationship, but he is kinda uptight and doesn't like to talk about his feelings.      Before we got together, he was married and cheated on his wife with a secretary from his work (not with me). When he finished with her cos he felt guilty she sent his wife a really nasty letter telling her everything, and they got divorced. This is something that he feels really bad about and still beats himself up a lot about. Now, the other night we went out and he got really drunk, and when we got home the drink seems to have loosened his tongue and he mentioned the girl he cheated with. I started asking him questions as it is rare that he will talk about this stuff, and he admitted that sometimes he misses her and he especially misses the sex. I said that if he still has feelings for her maybe they should try again, but he said that it wouldn't work as she was too insecure and there was too much bad water under the bridge.      Now, I can imagine that the sex is pretty exciting when you have an affair, so I suppose I kind of understand that, but of course it was a little upsetting. He then assured me that the sex we have is very good (I think it is).      The next morning I started kissing him and went to have sex, but he wasn't physically into it, if you get what I mean - this is the first time this has happened. He seemed a bit embarrassed by this and I didn't make a big deal of it, but it has left me a little confused.      Do you think it is because he felt vulnerable cos he had told me all this stuff when he was drunk? Is there any way I can make our sex more exciting - we have a good, friendly relationship and I wonder if this makes the sex boring for him compared to the more exciting forbidden affair - is there anything I can do about that? I mean psychologically, not whips and costumes and stuff like that ;)

20090308070910AAZnfQK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this make me a bad person? (boyfriend stealer)?	Okay.... so I'm a junior. At the very beginning of the year, I met a sophomore. Let's just say his name is Mike. Me and Mike were in the same sport and so we hung out for 3+ hours everyday after school and became really close friends. We started talking on the phone everyday. I could tell him anything! He would occasionally tell me stories about problems he was having with his girlfriend, how she was mean to him. After we had been very good friends for like five months, he broke up with his girlfriend and asked me out. I didn't intend for him to dump her, but I realized I really did have feelings for him. Now, we've been in a very happy relationship for three months. But I still secretly kind of feel bad for his ex girlfriend sometimes. Am I technically a bad person, or a "boyfriend stealer", *****, etc?

I'm not invited on anything. My invitations are never accepted.       And recently, a new guy came into our group. He's fun...he's a clown basically. Now he took my place.      I want to clear that my friends are not bad people. We used to have great times. It's just that I feel out of the picture. Unimportant and taken for granted. I don't know if they mean to do this.

20090506000601AA3dpWH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Bad situation, what should i do?	I have been talking to a girl for the past six months and things were going perfect until recently her marine ex boyfriend called her. she talked to me about considering talking to him for support since he is going to war soon so i didnt think much of it because of how bad he treated her in the past. but the past week she asked if we were to not see each other because she just has to figure out wether to seek closure with her and her ex or to try to work things out. this whole week she has been stressing herself if she mad the right decision of letting me go for her ex who she admitted herself that he wouldnt treat her as good i treated her. this whole week she reminisced on the good times we had and talked about how our first date in boston was the best date of her life and that she never thought she could meet a guy like me yadda yadda yadda. then today he came to school and gave her a surprise visit and she said she talked to him for hours and he acted and said alot of things that wasnt his usual self. She is now going to give him another shot and im left here completely torn. I'm a college student, i got a week left of school before finals begin. what should i do to begin to move on?
20090307210504AAIwN1Y	Family & Relationships;Friends	Nicest way to get her to admit "no"?	Ok, so the Thursday before last I asked a girl at my school if she'd like to go out with me. We're great friends, and I was hoping to bring that up a level higher. Her reaction was as I expected: Very surprised. She said she would think about it. I was very grateful for that, it's much better than a straight "no.". It's been over a week. I'm positive this is the "kind" no, ya know, the kind where the person says nothing rather than hurt the others' feelings. I keep telling myself it's no, but the awful part is that tiny little glimer of hope that it's a yes, that she's simply still thinking. My brain says no, heart keeps on hoping. Is there a nice way to get a final answer, so I can stop trying to lie to myself?

20090307230446AA2WS9m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I compete with other guys to get girls?	girls just seem to gravitate towards other guys. sometimes, it seems like other guys don't have to do barely anything, and a girl will be sitting in his lap.   i'll finally try talking to a girl, and some other guy will start talking to her and steal her away and destroy what little progress i make. even guys who already have girlfriends beat me. other guys are just better than me. so i usually give up early on now. i think i'm at least a little attractive. i get called cute by girls a lot, but they probably mean "teddy bear cute" cause i'm shy and kinda awkward.  i never seem to get a chance to talk to girls without other guys around. so how do i beat these other guys finally?

I've been hugged by women in my family and what not,but this one girl who I had a good friendship with,well she hugged me before and has always been friendly and fun to have laughs with,and always made sure I acknowledged her when she said hi,sometimes when I said just a quick hi,she'd ask What's wrong?"And when I came back after my dad died,she just came up to me and put her arms around my neck,The hug lingered and had that soft clinging velcro feel,and then she said "Hug me"Which I did,kind of in a state of suprise that she just walked up to me and wrapped her arms around my neck,and apparently she had heard of my dad dying, I figured I'd get moral support,I wasn't expecting to find myself in her arms like that,can't complain though,it let the endorphins fly free and that's not a bad thing at all.

PLZ?	my ex boyfriend cheated on me when i was in spain, and now i really want 2 be with again, and i know what he did was wrong, but why cant i get him off my mind?. When i got back from Spain to find out what was going on, he had told me that he didnt cheat on me, and that he was just sleeping with her in a bed. I told him to **** off and that it would never work between us. A few weeks later, i found out that hes now seeing that girl. I know hes a complete dick, but my feelings for him just arent going away, i just feel like the book hasnt closed yet. He apologized more then 30 times and wanted me back, but i kept on saying NO. but now i regret it. im just rly confussed because not being with him, is making me fall in love with him. what do i do? just leave it? or go for what i want?
20090307233347AAzP6I3	Family & Relationships;Friends	Advice on a friend issue?	This is going to be a long one,, ready?      I have been best friends with this girl for about five years now.  It used to always go really smoothly between us, but in the past six months or so we've been fighting A LOT.  Every time we get into a big fight, I always go to her and apologize and fix the problem, while she never lifts a finger.  It makes me feel like she doesn't care enough about our friendship to confront me about it when we have a problem.   It all got worse when last weekend she invited her friend over that I frankly don't get along with.  They invited me, along with a couple of other girls, to hang out with them, but they mostly kept to themselves and talked to this guy, so the rest of us felt left out, so we decided to go to my house.  My best friend asked if they were invited, and I told her that the whole reason why we were going was because we felt excluded.  Angry, she and her friend storm off, only to call me ten minutes later and say "Alyssa is staying here because SHE'S a GOOD friend." and hang up.  The other girls and I hung out at my house for a little while, then had to go back to where the other two girls were to walk my friend Jessie home.  Along the way, my best friend approaches me and yells, "What kind of $#!T did you talk about me this time?"  I responded with "Are you kidding me?  I didn't say a WORD about you!"  which was, of course, true.  So the girls I was hanging out with and I walked away, and later the guy that my best friend was hanging out with told me that when I left she called me a variety of profanities and said many rude things about me.  And the worst part, the next day she pretended that nothing happened.  No apology, no explanation, nothing.      Normally, I would just forget about it and move on, but during our last fight I told her that I was sick of being the one to pull all of the weight in our friendship, and that if she started another fight with me she would have to be the one to clean it up, so I haven't talked to her since.      Besides that fight, I've been beginning to think that I've outgrown her.  Lately she's just seemed so immature in everything she does, I kind of want to tell her "Until you decide to grow up a little, don't talk to me anymore." I'm REALLY tempted to throw her out of my life completely; I just don't think it's working anymore.         PLEASE, I need help on this one.  Your opinion on the matter?

I'm not anti-social or anything...just not into romantic relationships...up until recently. So my question is, when you do ask someone out, how do you let them know that you mean it as a date? Do you literally ask them "Hey wanna go on a date?" or is it like..."understood"? How clear should your intent be? Let's say you were getting along well with a person and you ask them out to eat or a movie, would that be a "date"? What if you ask them out as friends and they think its a date and turn you down like that? How do you people go about this?

20090308003411AAe6pHj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get over her when I see her all the time?	I'm a freshman in college and (quite stupidly) I've sort of fallen in love/infatuation/whatever with the girl who lives two doors down from me.  I've known her for a few months and was convinced that she's the most attractive/interesting person I've ever known, but I've been so shy around her that she barely knows me because I never talk when she's near me.      Anyways, based on her social circle and the fact that she parties a lot on weekends and stuff I've started to realize that she might not be exactly who I thought she was.  She is probably out of my league at this point anyways, and I've acknowledged that I should probably just get over her.      The problem is, I see her all the time and she lives just a couple meters away from me and I'm finding it really hard to stop thinking about her.  Even worse, maybe it makes me sound like a creep, but I hear her go out at night and get really jealous and distracted and stuff waiting to hear for when she gets back in...      Basically, the entire situation is really eating at me, but how can I get over someone I see all the time???
20090308003449AAv95Uz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to get over my past after change?	There was a girl that I feel deeply in love with, but things didn't work out, because I was a jerk, I had lot of personal issues/troubles back then and I didn't know myself very well. Experiencing this loss changed my life, and I went through a very major self-growth, and personal transformation phase(became a better person).       Now after many months, I find that I'm still in love with her(my feelings are still quite strong) and maybe in occasions I may see her, since she's good friends with the friends that I hang out with. There's a part of me inside that is holding on because everything that I am today is represented by the change that she made me become. She reminds me everyday, when I move forward and I am always thinking, if only she could see all this, then she would come back to me. I am a fighter you know and there's this flicker of hope inside my heart that won't go away, like she was the one that got away because of the person I was, and that only if I can have one more chance.
20090308003652AAf2njO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Me and this Girl like each other but she has a boyfriend still (Read)?	Hi im 18 years old and the girl i really like she is also 18. me and her do have a past when we were like 14-15 we dated but she lived to farm away since i did not have a car.

She tells me there something about me that she like and she said that she really like me. we go to the gym 4-5 days out of the week and work out. i spend more time with her then she does with her Bf. her BF is more of the Asshole type the bad boy, i am more of the one who really cares about her and want her to do her thing and don't want to control her. She has been with her bf for about 3.5 years. during that im i also had a Gf for the same time and i left here because of all the drama with her being in collage ect. she tell me she a player and that she does this alot. like hang out with other guys behind her Bf back. but she was going to stop before we started to talk again. i was going to go over her house and play wii with her sis and my friend. she asked me if i took my wii with me while i was driving and i was like is that all you want me for is my wii (jk) she said yes that y...... im jk i really miss u to.  my sis says that she think that she is just scared to leave her current Bf for me because she doent know what will happen with us like if we will stay together or not. I tell her i dont want to be her Bf asap and that i want to take her out on dates and stuff. But we are already doing that. like the other day she like you my best friend and like my other boy friend. what ever that means. then one other time i asked how she felt to me and she said she feel just like friends and maybe more but dont push her atm. im going to still hang out with here and go to the gym and hope she see that im better then her pot smoking controling Bf is. i mean i only hear negative stuff about him and that she realy like to be with me and hang out. what you guys think

20090308005041AAhKLkD	Family & Relationships;Friends	Heres advice for everyone.?	Live life to the fullest. Dont procrastinate. Love your parents and let them know it. Always be yourself and stand strong. Never miss a phone call. Dont do stuff like not hugging your parents goodbye in front of your friends. Do everything you want to do. Dont think of the negatives of what can happen. Life is to short and you need to love it. Dont live life behind a book. Dont be afraid to talk to a certain girl/boy. Theres no reason to be nervous. Make your life worth it. I just wanted to let some people know how i feel now.. my mom and dad are split up and she lives 2 blocks from me and i never see her and im 16 and i really need to get over my hatred to her boyfriend and see her. One day im going to regret these long months that ive been to selfish to see her. Respect everyone.

20090308053337AAw2XEs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What do you think of the people in this situation? Mature answers pls?	I work in a firm which have different departments.I was working here for around 7 months so i was the latest recruite.Everyone happens to know one another and they chat up all day at work and meet outside work when they are free while i don't do any of it as I am busy with two other places I work as well. I do not enjoy small talk and I am not very great in socialising too as I am very busy. Two times the manager we have told me as passing comment " why do u come here?" i ignored his comment. I got evaluated by the senior managers and they like my work.The senior manager happens to praise my work and I am confident about myself.  This same manager always comes and tries to make small talks with me when he gets free from work. There are three other females working in the same department who happen to like the man because every word he says is of high importance to them even if he is bulls.h.iting about the latest movie he have watched. I have notice that whenever he comes and tries to talk to me one of the three comes and starts asking him some nonsense questions or comes to me and gives me papers ( kinda distracting us from talking).I have notice that for a while but don't really care much. This guy two days ago came to the office of one of the female co workers while i was speaking to her. He saw my blackberry on the table and he started asking me is this the latest looks good wow.When i answered him yeah it is he then started looking at the other female and she looked at him back and they both started laughing really loud all in my presence and he still holds my mobile. I asked them why you guys laughing and gave me a vague answer. What do you all think of this?

20090227142718AAtK4vP	Family & Relationships;Family	My parents found out about me, smokin weed...?	took my dad's credit card last night and i hung out with my friends.i bought some stuff that i needed but my parents think that they are junks >_<.then in the middle of the night like around 3:00 my mom found me in the street...she yelled at me and started screaming at me...but she didn't know about the card.So then she went and searched my room and found the weeds that i bought and slapped me and yelled at me,then my dad came and sweared at me ...   should io go?or should i sneak out?also they grounded me for like 3 months and donated the things that i bought..but they still don't know about the 130$ that i spent with my dad's card..omg what should i do?   btw im pretending im writing HW now with my laptop   im 14   srry for reposting it i think theyre gonna kik me out
20090308051712AAJFxqJ	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need friend advice...... please....?	Between my "close" friend and I, there has been a lot of tension lately.  Now a days, it seems he ignores me a lot, and claims that I'm not myself because everything he ends up liking, I do too.  I didn't think anything of it because I thought hey we're friends and having similar interests is bound to happen.  Well, he got annoyed with it and hardly ever talked to me any more.  I invited him over last night, and he ignored my texts of course, then an hour later said "I'm really bored".... It just annoyed the crap out of me.  So eventually I sent him a message that went something like this:   "Goodbye... I can't be a part of a "friendship" that is a lie.  You say I've changed, but I haven't changed one bit.  You have changed and don't even know yourself anymore.  Take a look in the mirror.  I'm moving on... let me know if you decide to catch up."      Not the exact words at all (somehow the message got erased out of my phone), but that is the idea.  .  .  .  I don't know what is even going on anymore.  We were really good friends, and .... sigh.  Comments? Help? Advice? PLease?

Yes, I still write a blog, often on sentimental issues, reflecting on the past or on a not-so-peaceful family. Sometimes I am soft-spoken. I don't hang out with big groups of friends. I prefer solitary activities: read, write, play guitar, internet.      Why is that quiet/shy guy get this "effeminate" label?   ladies, what do u say on this. Some say it's "cute", some say it's mysterious, some say it's a turn off, some say it's a lack of confidence.

20090308030023AAszkN9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys please help, as i am hopeless at decoding males lol?	i work with a guy who has become a very good friend of mine. If we are not at work together, we are either texting each other or more recently, emailing each other.   The issue here is that he has a girlfriend. Now before you all launch into a lecture about how he is taken and that i should respect that, i must tell you that i do very much respect that. I would NEVER make the first move on someone knowing that he has a girlfriend. Our conversations are friendly and we have never kissed or done anything. But what confuses me the most is that last night, i was at home and i get a text from him wondering what i am up to. i reply with, "oh not much, just going to take the dog for a walk." he then asks me if he can join me. I say yes, and then we meet up. He brings alcohol along, and we both get a bit tipsy. We walked around our area (we live 10min walk away from each other) for about 4 hours. We had a long conversation with no awkwardness or anything. we never kissed or did anything like that either. When i asked him what his girlfriend was doing thinking that she may have been busy that night, he replied with "shes at home" and that was all we spoke about her. i dont understand why he would be hanging out with me if he has a girlfriend to hang out with. He is always so nice to me and always looking out for me. I am not as physically attractive as his girlfriend but he seems to enjoy spending time with me. i DONT want to risk losing his friendship or freaking him out by asking him what the grey area is, as i fear that there might not be any grey area for him, and that he thought we were just friends. But i feel something more, adn he is acting in a way that makes me think there might be something more there. What is going on here?
20090308051217AAlqK5z	Family & Relationships;Friends	Too afraid to be open with friends?	Ever since I moved (from New Zealand to Australia), I've been a very closed off person. I only just figured out why- when I moved, I left all my friends behind, I basically lost everything. I'm dealing with that ok right now, at least better than I ever have been. But now I never feel like socialising, or being myself in front of my friends. I don't trust people anymore. I'm afraid of getting too close, because if I lose them, then that'll hurt even more. All my friendships feel like an empty shell of those which I had 'back home'. Basically, moving here has given me some major trust issues. I'm sick of being this cold, closed off, unemotional person. But I don't know any other way of being safe. What do I do?

However I have never found it easy since I was abused in my teens and from time to time still get flash backs.       I often get upset and emotionally distant after and sometimes during sex and have tried to explain myself but obviously it is really upsetting him and he now says I always get upset. Is this normal? How can I prevent it or make him understand? I feel SO incredibly guilty that I've hurt him what can I do?      I have also recently been getting the feeling he is just trying to please himself and I often don't feel anything by the time he has finished I get upset by this too. It would definately upset him too much to hear this though.

Does it mean i am hot or does everyone get these things? cause i have no idea and i suffer from Borderline PD where i seem to feel worthless all the time so its hard for me to understand it.

20090227135950AABN9Dz	Family & Relationships;Family	Is my mother wrong or should I just deal with this?	I am an only daughter, 20 years old, turning 21 at the end of March, with a single, very protective mother. My family is Filipino and is quite conservative and strict. I have been dating my boyfriend for 2 and a half years now and he has met everyone who matters in my family, and they all like him.       I recently became a commuter as I am a senior in college, and with only two classes twice a week, it no longer made sense for me to be paying the thousands of dollars to live on campus. My boyfriend, however, still does, and I only see him about 5 hours a week now, between my classes and work. My mother does not let us be in the same room alone together for very long or without her supervision in some way, and would not even tolerate the thought of me spending one night a week with my boyfriend if I have no commitments the next day. She would rather I get home at 3 in the morning, alone on the subway, than stay the night.      My grandfather's generation raised my mother's with the rule that couples are not allowed to live together while they are still in school. I find this fine, especially since I only have one year left till I graduate and am planning to move to DC (with my boyfriend). However, my friends and some of my cousins, who are a lot more strong-willed than I am, are able to move out and live on their own, spend the night wherever they want to within reason, even if it is with a significant other (who, might I add, they had been seeing for MUCH less time than I have been with my boyfriend), and just aren't subject to the same rigid and, the older I get, more ridiculous rules that I am. She tries to keep track of my passwords to my bank accounts and my grades (though I have managed to keep her out of that lately), she needs to know what exactly I am doing at any time and how to reach me, she requests that I tell her my exact work schedule and dictates to me what days she wants me to work (I just ignore her and have told her to stop trying to control that when it is my job, but the point is she still does it and thinks it's appropriate). She just does not seem to understand that I am an intelligent and responsible adult, very much her doing and for which she should be proud and able to relax, and that she must realize she has to start letting me do things on my own, instead of her doing them for me because no way is right but her own.      What should I do? I am in the process of looking for a therapist with whom I can speak about my problems with the way my mother is not letting me grow up when I am almost 21, but I am wondering if there are other people out there who have similar situations, to tell me what they would suggest or what they did.
20090227143356AA8o1hu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Playing Your Cards While Dating?	I've been seeing this guy for 3 months now and I do the unavailability thing. Sometimes I turn my phone off just so that I won't be tempted to answer when he calls and make plans to see him at the last minute.      Well Wednesday, I had my phone off the whole night and decided to do me. A quiet evening at home in front of the TV. When he called me last night he asked why I didn't answer when he called the night before. I told him the truth that I turned it off and was in chill mode. We did however spend the whole night together last night and he kept talking about how I didn't answer his call and he thought that I was maybe with another man.      He said, you not answering my calls, is that how you're playing your cards now? What did he mean by that. He doesn't always answer when I call him or jump to call me back and he hardly ever responds to my texts. So why was he making a big deal out of me not answering his call one night & what did he mean by is that how I'm choosing to play my cards now?

But we get along well so that's why he wants me to next weekend.  Will I get high the first time? And how do I control myself not to cough because he said once you cough its all over.

20090308044655AAOjPdp	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Falling Out Of Love? What to do?	I've been with my boyfriend for months, and we were best friends beforehand, and we get on really well together. I though we'd never have the chance to be together so I was delighted when we got together. Everything was great until January when he became jealous of a guy friend of mine. I chose him and told him not to worry and he's gotten over that, and he thinks he's in love with me and we'll be together forever. I know he only thinks so because we're only teenagers, and i know life goes on. I cant help but think logically about it, but now as a result i don't know what to do, i love him, but i think he loves me more, and i know that secretly he's rather vulnerable and i don't want to hurt him. Should I stay with him for as long as it takes for him to stop loving me, I dont know what to do.

When you're on the verge of beginning to date someone, and you discover something that you disagree about, how do you handle the situation?  Especially if it looks like the other party's opinion is based on a mistaken understanding of the facts?  It's not an important issue at all.  But would you try to convince them they're wrong?  Try to come to a compromise?  Drop the subject?  Agree to disagree?  How would you handle it?

Alright, this girl has a huge crush on me. So I took her out.      At the end of the date, she suddenly had a mini-flip out and starts saying, "YOU are soooo indecisive, you know that? God, you're soooo indecisive. When we were in that taxi? Remember that? You are SOOOOOOO indecisive!!!"      And I kept my cool and said, "well, Amy. I guess you're just gonna have to get used to it ;) Can you do that?"      And suddenly she had this surprised look on her face, paused for a split-second, and then she calmed down and she says "Yes I can. I can do that."      Was that a test? She's a really sweet girl otherwise and she's smart and really artsy. Do all girls seriouysly do these things? Are these to test our manliness or something?

20090308010748AAzjq6m	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do some girls hold back even though they're interested?	I've been chasing her since october and I am absolutely in love with her. She says she loves me, she flirts with me, she shows me that she really does care about me, she's made it pretty clear that she's interested. Yet our relationship is not even official.       She won't even open up to me about why she's holding back. I have fallen for her pretty hard, but I don't understand why she's making it so difficult? Is she shy? hurting inside? hiding something?

20090308033603AA41iub	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WHY WON'T ANYONE TALK TO ME???	I'm trying to word this in the best way possible as to not sound selfish or vain. I can tell that some guys find me attractive, yet they won't even make an effort to talk to me. I don't necessarily want to be asked out, but at least talked to. Even some girls find me slightly intimidating or hard to approach to become friends with, when I really am very sweet and not so judgmental as other people may be. I am NOT saying i am the prettiest person on the planet, but it annoys me that it's hard to even make new friends because I look hard to talk to.....   Is there anything I can do to maybe give off a more inviting, and warm presence?   I am straight incase you were wondering...

20090308041323AAaF0Be	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to break it off with him ........ :(            ,?	I've been dating my current boyfriend for around about a year now.    When I first met him, he was constantly on my mind. I couldn't stop thinking about him.   Now, I've got no feelings for him. He's like just a person that comes over. He practically means nothing to me. I'm not being bland, but please continue reading and see why.      I dumped him about 6 months ago, because I heard he had cheated on me more then 5 times. I got back with him 2 weeks later.      The thing is - there is a guy named Pato who moved to our school this year. He is like my closest friend, and he actually stands up for me.       On the weekend we had a party and I saw my boyfriend hugging another girl, hanging his hand around her shoulder. I started crying and ran up the stairs to where my house is close to. Pato stopped me and kissed me - it was really awkward because I didn't know whether he was drunk or not. But his breath didn't smell like alcohol.       I was just stunned and started walking back home.      My boyfriend doesn't know about this.      Pato is my boyfriends best friend and they are really, really close.      How can I break it off with my current boyfriend for Pato? I think Patos the one.

20090308013848AAxudG2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I get past looks?	I know some of the ladies might be upset with me for asking this but I'm just being honest.        I'm a 27 year old American guy and I have been dating for a while and have come up with this problem.  I've been meeting many different types of women but many of the women fall into 2 basic categories.      Some of them are beautiful, but we have nothing in common and no connection at all.      Some of them are not good looking at all, not even what I would consider 'plain' or 'ordinary'.  (Sorry for the lack of a better word.)   But they have many of the things I look for in a woman and are just great people.      Even though I believe the inside is truly most important, if that outside isn't there at all, then I can't see myself with her.        I'd like to get past this but if there are no romantic feelings from the beginning, what should I do?      If I'm not attracted to someone, 2 or 3 dates isn't going to change anything.      Have any advice for me?

In a few weeks, the lnog distance will be over bcuz im going to stay with him until hes done with gradschool       Lately, i feel myself being really clingy and wanting more of his time. It seems that hes always out with his friends, and his defense   " i hate typing on the computer, and it sucks being stuck in my dorm room on the computer while i can hear all my friends goin to dinner. Plus its one thing to leave you to hang out with my friends while we're together and another thing  to go out with my friends when ur not here"      i guess its true, and we DO talk ..i jsut wish it was more and becuase of this, i need reassurance all the time...which irritates him, and thus makes me more insecure...which then leads to him NOT wanting to talking to me. Hes said nemerous times that our conversations arent fun etc etc..But to me , it still seems like he doesnt need to be with his freinds soo much? Or is that legit since Im not really there with him? How do i stop being so clingggy?

Ok, maybe i'll get married, but I am NOT having no kids.       I tried telling him how I feel. But he keeps doing it. What should I do.

Hi, I'm 13, grade 7 and there's this girl I really like, she is pretty, she's not like those girls that are like paris hilton and stuff, she's like the perfect girl for me but I have trouble aproching her cause I don't want to be like a *** or like an *** infront of her so I get shy cause I don't want her to think I'm a wierdo and stuff. I just got to know her the begining of the school year and stuff, I know alot about her so it's hard for me to talk to her or just small talk since I don't know what to say and stuff. And if I become to flirty with her, it'll be kinda awkward if she doesn't like me since she'll prob tell other people and it'll be like a huge rumor and you know grade 7's we're almost all imature about love, well not me but yea. She likes me like a friend I guess but I can't find a way to become more than a friend like best friends or even in a relationship and stuff, when Im with her I get shy and freeze up and don't know waht to say. But like on msn I can talk to her for a long time since I'm not infront of her and stuff and if I say something I can always say jokes or like my friend wrote that ;P .Can someone tell me how to aproach a girl you like without being like shy and stuff. And ideas for small talk or something.   Please help!! A.S.A.P.

20090308032629AA0ccIn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My gf wants me 2 talk 2 some1 that likes me?	OK so there's this girl in my LA class and its pretty obvious that she likes me, and my girlfriend is encouraging me to talk to her..whats up with that? is she testing me?      Furthermore Explained:   Ok so how my gf got 2 know that she likes me is um...well here it is. My gf was sick and didnt go to school, and all my friends were either sick, or went to college in the middle of the day (running start) so i didnt get 2 see any of them. So i had a bad day. I talked to my gf and told her about my day and said it sucked because i didnt get 2 talk to any1 that i know, well i did but not really an in depth convo. So she asked didnt u talk to that 1 chick in ur class. And i was like naw, shes absent. She knew that i talked 2 her in class because she talked 2 me as we were walking down the hall 1 day and my gf was there 2. Her class is right next 2 mine (my gf's). The next day, i go off to my class holding my gf's hand as always and i give her a hug and a kiss as always, and my gf says u need to get 2 ur class, and then she tells me that i should talk 2 the girl that likes me, and i was like eh..? I asked why and she said i don't want u 2 break her heart, and i was like eh...? I told her that i'm not going anywhere like in our relationship because i already have the one that i want. and she smiled. Is she testing me? She also said that i am allowed 2 talk 2 people before as well. There has been a lot of girls that have "liked" me and that i have talked 2, but i don't like any of them, i just like my gf. So what are your opinions? why does she do this? is she testing my trust? or like does she genially think that i should talk 2 her? i am leaning more towards the side that she is testing me.

20090308040850AAOQlkR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How much of a role does confidence really play in attracting females?	Alright, I'm currently about 2 months away from being 21. Until high school graduation, I was the shy/social anxetic and quiet guy, who couldn't really stand any of the girls, since most seem like bi***es.      Then when college came and people acted more respectable, I seemed to be more social, make people laugh (in a good way), respected myself for who I was, and just felt like, "If you don't like me, than oh well".      Now, it seems girls at times with give me huge smiles and it's like their face lights up. Some even laugh in a "cute manner" at the things I do. Some girls even giggle and act embarrassed to each other when I look at them. (Yes I mean even girls my age act somewhat this way).      As far as I know, my physical did not really change, so can just a few personality changes just "spice" things up that much?
20090308033415AAabU0N	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I do this? Or is it too sweet? Help!?	A long time ago, my mother told me that the bedroom was a place to forget about all your fights with your partner and be able to just sleep together and pretend like nothing happened. Bedrooms are not places for fighting. My boyfriend is very dominant, controlling, and violent. Whenever we get into a miserable, absolutely HORRIBLE fight, I'm always still willing to cuddle as soon as we're in the bedroom. He told me that he thinks it's a really cute philosophy, but I'm trying to really get something in my head here.   Do you think this thing I do is cute?   Or do you really think I should stop doing this and worry about someone taking advantage of it?

He filters stuff/feelings. I'm tired of getting upset. It gets just worse if i go to him when I am, and he dsnt feel anything anyways. I don't think he's the one.       I feel that everything isn't real? Im moving in 4months. I don't know..End it now or when we don't get to talk/see each other often after I move? Im so tired of this crap. I don't know if it's worth waiting? If its worth anything? Its good sometimes but only because I bother? He thinks you can only be "soul mates" by having exactly the same intelligence and hobbies. When I talk about seperating, he doesn't bother? No response?       Sometimes, I just feel like being 15 and stupid again. It feels so much better that way. I love him but I don't think he feels the same way. I'm just drained.       Advice,opinions,say anything you want. thanks..

My mil talks badly about me to family members and for years, i noticed that family members just ignored her, because they liked me and I was always myself and ignored her nasty comments. After ten years of her abusive comments and everything, I eventually started getting ruder and ruder with my comments towards her, and now have had several fights with her, one being in public. Now she sits back and says, SEE everyone, I told you. Now hubby's family and sis act very different towards me. Because of my hatred towards mil, I decided to stay away from the family for a while-----but am making myself sick over the fact that my reputation is ruined and everyone believes my mil. How do i redeem myself?

20090308012248AA4URqX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Falling in love with an older man. A MUCH older man.?	So about four months ago, I started seeing this guy. Let's call him Joe. The first time we went out, we really hit it off and surprisingly became great friends. We talk about everything and he understands me more than anyone (besides my family) and he's become the most caring person in my life. About a month ago we became intimate with each other for the very first time. I didn't think it was possible but we became even closer than before. He lives about two hours away from me but we always manage to spend a lot of time together. My job as a dance coach allows me to travel often at night and his job allows him to travel weekends. Last night,Joe and I had a very deep talk, in which he expressed his feelings to take things to another level. He wants me to spend spring break with him and his family at his home. It will be the longest amount of time we've ever spent together consecutively. I was so excited for this because I think that it will give me an opportunity to know him even better (you never truly know someone until you've lived with them, right?). But then reality slapped me in the face. Joe is 43 and I am 18. I just graduated high school last year. He has teenage children who are two years younger than me. I'm hesitant about this because 1) My parents would definitely be upset. I haven't even told them about Joe's age (2) I'm afraid that I'll get too comfortable in the situation and will want more and (3) I'm going to fall in love with him but our relationship can't ever be more than this. I'll always be girlfriend material but not wife material. But I can see myself being his wife someday. But he probably can't see it. I'm really confused. So I want to know what others think about our relationship and whether you think I should spend the break with him and his children? Please be kind and refrain from stating the obvious (yes, I know I'm young, naive, silly, and he may seem old and perverted but I know him very well by now so I'm not in any danger). Thank you. Have a nice night/day.

I've fallen deeply in love again with my ex-girlfriend who I dated in early high school.  We broke up because I had to move, but I moved back in the summer last year.  We've been close friends since.  However, before this happened, I had a talk with her the previous year, about us being able to date again, and she said she would like that.  But, it's a year later, and I don't think she feels this way anymore.  What the hell do I do?  Should I try and forget about it, or should I carefully pursue this?  Please help.

20090308012911AAsmIyM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to deal with partner who is teaming up with another guy to get back at you?	Hi everyone, this may be another typical question, but I hope that I could get some good answers.   I've dated Sarah for 5 months, lately she did question me about matters over my ex. She even asked me:" Don't u like girls with such strong ambitious character, like your ex ?" I was like, "what do you mean" & she went about questioning more about the ugly side of my ex.I mentioned that I was not comfortable with the question & wanted her to switch to another topic. She look pretty unhappy with my response. Days later, she was upset with me for not able to be with her for a day (I had work). She was so upset that she called up a friend to both of us, Gerald, & was all tears complaning that I didnt care for her feelings. Well, this wasn't the 1st time. Apparently she was calling this guy all along whenever she had a problem with me & never ever once told me face to face about it. & every single time it was tears & more tears. Yet, the thing is that Gerald also DID NOT inform me about anything Sarah had complained, not even a bit! & continued to comfort her. Well, after finding out, I was quite upset with her but didnt really took it to heart, yet i feel that there is something going on between them. Yes, you might think I'm paranoid, but please read on. There was once Gerald was depressed over some matters of his own & he told Sarah. Well, Sarah went out, bought something for him & even stuck a post-it note on it saying that she's giving him her support & hope he feels better. I discovered this note when I went to Gerald's place with Sarah one day. Immediately Sarah snatched the note from my hands & I was quiet appalled. Anyway, I did caught a glimpse of the note but was not sure. So, I asked, was the note written by her to Gerald? She keep on denying & said that there was nothing between them. Finally, I did read the note when she was unaware, & yes, it was definitely to Gerald & hand written by her. I just keep this to myself. Few days later, I called Sarah up one night & she said she was doing her work in her room, thinking of not disturbing her, I went to Gerald's house few blocks away, then I discovered that she was indeed doing her work BUT in Gerald's home! I could see her through the window sitting in the living room but there was no sign of Gerald. The point is, why did she say she was in her room? It's not like she was upset with me that day. I texted her a message asking again about her whreabouts & she replied something else, totally ignoring my question, I was very upset, & asked her again, & she replied in a not so polite manner saying that she's STILL IN HER ROOM. I was by the door & looking at her! It's not spying as my intentions were to visit Gerald! I'm just too surprise to see her there & lying to me. Months later, she was away & said she would be going to her friends house followed by a visit to a relatives house. I was not with her as I was away with work. Recently I discovered she went to Gerald's house for few nights & now telling me that she hasn't seen Gerald at all for months!! It's too much & I'm really upset with her. But she's sort of back firing now & dishing out to Gerald about the downsides of my relationship with her & worse! She even told Gerald to meet up with my ex & trashing heaps of negative info about me. Considering we're still friends, my ex called me up & told me everything, she did not want to be in the middle of this but she just thought that I should know about this. Now both Gerald & Sarah are very upset with me & thinking that its my fault that I do not care enough for Sarah. What should I do?

20090308051800AAUtaH2	Family & Relationships;Friends	Where can I buy Cuddly Toys? Can this kind gesture be too much?	Hello everyone, I was just wondering if anyone knows where to buy cheap cuddle toys from, say for like a ￡1 each, just miniature. Everytime I go out say for a meal or something, I like to take the lady guests a gift each, so buying one for all of them does add up to quite alot hence why I asked for cheap :P.      Another question, some of these girls have boyfriends, but I still go and give them a gift infront of them as it's not fair to leave them out, do you reckon I might be disliked for this kind gesture from their point of view? Because last time I felt awful considering one of the girls decided to put her boyfriend on the spot asking why he doesn't do such sweet things.      Help is appreciated.
20090308052225AAoxed0	Family & Relationships;Friends	My best friends fiancé comes onto me all the time!?	he’s always grabbing me around the waist or squeezing my legs when she’s not around. The other day he hugged me and tried to kiss me. I never reciprocate and never will.   There is no way I could tell her what’s going on as it would break her heart and he is all she’s got. I feel like I’m going to have to just walk away from the friendship, but with no explanation, or to fall out with her on purpose so I don’t see her anymore. Part of me thinks if I told her she’d choose him over me anyway as she’s so dependant on him. We’ve been friend for 8 years. What should I do!?
20090308052659AA6mSCe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	CSA Back payments arrears / Assessment calculations help?	I am a 44 year old male with 2 children from my previous marriage the children are 18 yrs old and 15 yrs old.    I have a 25% equity share in the matrimonial home which is payable when my youngest turns 18 yrs old.      I had accrued some arrears several years back and the CSA had agreed a monthly payment of around ￡60 per month on top of the normal maintenance payment. In all I have been paying ￡370 per month including arrears, I have just been re-assessed and the payments are going up to ￡550 per month, partly because I have been reassessed and my wages have gone up slightly (pitty they don't reduce them when the cost of living goes up) And secondly because my arrears now have to be paid within a set period, which has taken it up by another ￡30 per week.    This has put me in an impossible situation, I am on the old system ie. 30% less certain expenses like my mortgage. I have since re-married but my wife as strange as it seem will not move in as she refuses to have anything financially to do with my children.       So heres the question.... can they ramp up my payments without any regard to my financial commitments?   My take home pay is ￡1850 monthly I have an ￡800 mortgage, council tax ￡100 per month + every day living costs, I have been accessed at ￡86 per week if I took out a pension (which at the moment I havent got one) would that reduce my maintenance payments?

20090308053615AAGRCII	Family & Relationships;Friends	Should i leave my best friend for a over posessive boy friend?	Hi People,       I am in a kind of a fix, Hope you would help me out ;       Here's my story, I have been in relation with a Guy ( Mr. A ) for the past 5 years, Initially we went out great, i passed out college and had to go some other city for my further studies. We were very happy till then, he used to come over at weekends to meet me & we two loved each other very much, till that time we were into a very good Love & physical Relation. But after i completed my MBA, i wanted to take up a job. He was against it, and wanted me to stay at home and not take up job, fearing i might bump into bad guys in the corporate world. I went against his wishes and joined a company. I had studies so much and wanted to stand on my own feet.       He always used to call me at work and would ask me to hold the phone when i talk to some  male colleague, would call me up at lunch and even then would ask me to hold the phone & listen to the talks I'm having with my friends. He wouldn't allow me to attend office parties neither would allow me to go on office trips, asking me if i have to attend the same, you can call me & then we can go together on my office trips.      In the office i met a male colleague(Mr. B), we became friends, good friends, Best Friends & one day i proposed him. But he refused, saying its just the infatuation i have and nothing else. But i insisted, that i really love you very much. Days went by we ( Mr. B & I ) became real close friends, we shared a lot of things, I shared a lot about my past relation with Mr A. ( Even the extent of Physical we have had ). Mr. B helped me everything. Slowly, we fell for each other & started out a relation (Including physical). It all was going great guns, when i realized we two didn't have any future, because we are from different communities & i cant go against my families wishes. I Conveyed this to him. Since he wanted his love & best friend ( ME ) to be happy, accepted my decision with grace & gave him self a chance to be my friend. He was proving to be a very good friend.      Now comes the time, when i again realize what wrongs i have done with Mr. A. He changed himself (for me) & had invested 5 years for me. (only wanting to get married to me). Mr. A is well settled and has many matrimonies coming for him, but refusing everything because he wants to spend his life with me. And changed all his habits for me. Just for the old time sake and the way he has changed himself for me, I went back to him & Committed.  He asked me to convey this thing to Mr. B ( that i wanted to spend life with him) , but he betrayed me and himself called up Mr. B and told him everything about our relation. Mr. B called me up asked about it, and i confronted him yes i do love Mr. B. Also, Mr. B very honestly told me & My Boy Friend that he still loves me. But wouldn't come in way of your relation anytime. All he needs is to be my Friend. All this lead to a big brawl among the guys.       Now my boy friend ( Mr. A ) doesn't want me to be friends with a person with whom i was in a relation ( fearing all the pains he might have to go again ). I broke all my relation with Mr. B ( my best friend ), who till the end, only wanted my friendship & nothing else.      But considering the pains i have given to my boy frnd earlier ( i dint want him to suffer again, because of me), I finally called off all relation with Mr. B ( including friendship ). He even accepted that and left my life sacrificing all his love & friendship for my happiness.       At this point of time, only person who is happy is my Boy Friend ( Mr. A ), I'm not at all happy, because i couldn't give a person, what he wanted till the last moment. He's totally broken. I think i haven't done justice.       Please help me, what should i do now ? I'm in a very bad state of mind

I just had an experience with my girlfriend, who is absolutely amazing.  The problem was that we were at it for a good 3 and a half to four hours and I couldn't finish.  I did eventually and it was altogether an amazing experience.  I just feel bad because I feel like she thinks she's not good.  That's not true.  I've never experienced anything like it before.  It's the best sex I've ever had.      How do I finish quicker?  Not too fast though.  It's great to have such a long lasting experience, but it's seems too much like work and not making love.
20090227140637AADMFfR	Family & Relationships;Family	My son just racked up $30 in Easy-edge Data Charges on his cell . What's a good way to make him work it off?	My 11 year old downloaded lots of "free" demo's on his phone, not knowing while the application charge for the demo was at no cost, they charge $3.00 per MB downloaded. I was so mad!!!! I wanted to spank him!!! But I don't like to do that, and I don't think I would have felt any better about it afterwards. I'm trying to figure out a meaningful way to let him see the error of his ways and also make me feel a little compensated at the same time. I thought about taking the phone away, but I like for him to be able to contact me when needed, as I go out of town a lot and he goes to afterschool and I just like to have that direct line of communication. Any good ideas?

I have recently discovered that a 22 year old guy is actively planning an affair with a married woman who is 40 years old.  The guy is my unborn child's father, and we're in a kind of messy relationship.  The woman is a close friend of his family.  I'm not supposed to know about it, and they dn't know about it, but it affects me personally as well as the woman and her family--it would break them apart.  Should I talk to someone about it?  If so, who?      I don't feel comfortable talking to the woman, because I don't know her very well and quite honestly, I am disgusted that she would be willing to risk her family's stability.  I want to talk to the guy about it, but I am afraid that he will stop speaking to me because I found out.  I just don't know what to do.  Help is appreciated! Thanks in advance

Now the boyfriend part is the biggest issue because this guy (who she met in December 2008) has stolen money and beat her up.      My friend receives SSI benefits and welfare. Her SSI check was $4000.00 in December and she spent that entire check on her boyfriend. He then stole $800.00 from her and beat her so bad he sent her to the hospital.

20090308080543AA9aavc	Family & Relationships;Family	What's wrong with my mom?	Lately, she's just seemed really distant. She doesn't kiss my dad when he comes home like she used too. She yells at my brothers and I all the time, and yesterday she burst out crying when my dog ate some pretzels out of the pantry (something that a few weeks ago would have been no big deal). What the hell is wrong with her? I'm really scared she's never acted like this before.

20090308075718AAmPseW	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Dating the wrong kind of women?	After breaking up with a woman i thought i was going to marry   I got depressed gained weight (55 lbs), then decided to move away for a fresh start. I started my own business and decided i was going to wait for a woman who loved me for who i was.   Then i started meeting/getting setup with women i wasn't all that attracted to, and realized the problem was me.   I decided to start losing weight and not date again til i felt better about myself. Now I'm labeled as shallow but guess what my weight was slowing me down and women who did want to date me had either had 4 kids or some kind of personality disorder.   Friends tell me I should appreciate what i can get but i think i can do alot better than women who have no other options.   Opinions are welcomed, and please be honest

20090308062931AAqXEt1	Family & Relationships;Family	One of my sisters accused me  of been jealous yesterday  because they have partners  and I don't?	I'm a single parent. They do not know the violent circumstances in which my daughter was conceived when I was 16 as I was always too ashamed to tell them. I was very young and scared. They all just assumed I was a dirty little whore who had shamed the family. The truth is i'm not jealous as i'm the youngest it is constantly listening to my elder siblings moaning about their partners that has just plain and simple put me off combined with how my beautiful intelligent daughter was conceived I feel as though i'm better off staying single. Now i'm left wondering if I would be better off telling them the truth about what happened in my past or keeping it where it is. My family are not a very compassionate family and make me feel as though I don't deserve to be part of a loving family. I've been made the scape goat for everything bad that has happened in my life and theirs. Should I just walk away and leave things unsaid or what. What would you do?

20090308081235AAd2R8p	Family & Relationships;Family	Can anyone understand what my mother means? What does she want?	My mother hates it when I try to be grown up, but also when I try to be a kid. I tried to do everything myself, even if I didn't know how or couldn't do it well (iron my clothes, wash dishes, wash my clothes, etc.) and I just stayed in my room and studied for school most of the time (which was pointless. It never helped me in school.). I stayed home almost all the time. Pretty much, I tried to copy what I saw my mom do. Well, she didn't like it at all. She said I need to stop trying to act all grown and act like what I am: a child (this was months ago). So that's what I did. I acted like a child. If I didn't get what I want, I threw a tantrum like a two year old. I played with my food. I made my bedroom a complete mess. I waited for my mom to tell me everything. I let her  pick out my clothes and do my hair. But she still didn't like it and told me I need to start acting like an adult. I don't get it! Which one does she want? Any help here?      By the way, I'm about 15. And the things I did when I was acting like a child, I learned from my six-year-old friend. Not sure if that will make any difference, but I thought it might help with the answers.

20090308062553AAEDd51	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it normal for a guy to break up over the phone, and never call back?	This guy and I have been going out for three months. It was going good until a few mis-communication problems occured, at which point we decided to talk.      After talking, he puts ALL the blame on me on being distant, etc. etc. and then he says that we should just continue talking and get to know each other better, since he thinks the relationship has potential.      I am fine with this, the week after I try to make things better by being less distant and calling more.  A few days after, on one of our phone calls, he just says we should play it cool and to talk less (when only a week ago he had wanted to give another chance). You could hear from my voice that I was hurt and upset about it, it's as if someone was telling you that you're annoying and to stop calling! When in reality I gave him soo much space.      Anyway, after that phone call, and after seeing how hurt I was, he never called back again.      Do I have the right to be mad? Or is it normal for guys to do that during short term relationships? Shouldn't he have done it more smoothly? Or at least called back and appologized?

Now he says its Aarons fault, because he knows Aarons type.   I don’t know what to do? I feel so bad for letting Carl down, but Carl doesn’t own me, I don’t want to lose this friendship with him, he’s so lovely.   And will & Danny called saying how I have just fuked Carl off, how could I, he’s so nice... Etc.    I don’t know what to do?

We are so close that people really thought we are real brothers, is sort of the bromance kind of thing       Every Sunday whenever his father bring him out for entertainment he will never fail to ask me along. Later on he moved house and once in awhile he will contact me and still hang out. However I did not treasure this friendship and thus lost contact.      I wish I had such friend again, a straight guy not gay and always want to hang out together. I'm a gay so will a straight guy want to be so close friend to a gay guy?      Do you have such friend?

He got all mad at me for saying it's a relationship or nothing. Does he have the right to ask me that? Am I wrong for saying no? I think he is being completely selfish, but my emotions are a lil crazy right now so I'm not sure what to do about this situation.
20090308074328AAFUAOn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Over 21 please! and this is sort of long but right now i really need advice :(?	My bf turned 22 and i guess had a reality check. We were dating for 2 years and he was telling me how he feels old etc.   then BOOM..we broke up but it was bitter sweet.   He tells me how much he loves me and how hard it is and how amazing i am and how much he wishes he was 25 so he could marry me right now etc.   but his mind is made up aboutthe breakup and even though i tried talking about it he gets mad. so i have to leave it   should i just leave him and give himhis space and let him figure things out?   Its so tough. I saw him 2 weeks ago (we broke up on feb 1st) and he cant stop hugging me and treating me like his gf again when we see each other...open my door, kiss my hands, my nose etc.   We are also both in ourr 4th year of university as well   Honestly, the relationship was so mature and great. Even he admitted that when he was talking about it..sad ofcourse.   We hvant talked since Valentines day and its hard because we talked everyday for a 2 years.But that was his choice. I alwtas told him no pressure if he doenst have the time to text or call but for 2 years he always texted me "goodnight love".. I know he still loves me and still cares. The last 2 times i saw him he couldnt let go of me and couldnt stop telling me that yet didnt want to talk about why he wants this.         ok, so its been a month and he saw my a university the other day and i waved to him...he came up to me and hugged me for the longest time and kissed my forehead. I was confused!! he sent me a msg later that night saying ti was good to see me and that he enjoyed the hug he also said that if we had started dating when we were 24/25 i would have been the one. & that right now he needs to figure himself out first.      i replied and i agreed with him that he needs to figure things out   and that 24/25 thing doesnt matter as you cannot time things like that.   I wished him luck in his studies and everything      do you think i handled it well?!?!?!      by the way, I knwo what alot of youmay be thinking. oh he wnats to party it up and see what else is out there. We cleared that up. I jokingly asked if there was someone else when we were breaking up and he said that he cant even thinkof something like that & that if i were with someone else it would hurt him beyond belief. & he partied sooo much before i met him when he was 18 and 19(legal age in Cda). He absolutely hates the clubs now too. Thinks hes passed that stage.He is stressed with alot of other stuff right now though.   Also, my friends are in a couple of his classes and they keep saying he looks really sad or somethings just on his mind.   oh, and no he did not cheat on me haha.      ok, so its been a month and a half after trhe break up. I texted him last last saying sorry i forgot to drop off his laptop and will get a friend to drop it off :)      his reeply was soo cold just    "ok"      i replied and said "by the way, you made an excellent decision. I totally agree with the breakup now:)"      his reply was "ok"      i replied again ( i know i shouldnt)   and said that i didnt think it would be so awkward between us but whatever makes him happy and that this was the last time id be texting him.      his reply was "im just busy"      Why is he being so cold ?? i dont understand. I know he is going through something but he was NEVER mean to me like this at all.   & no, he was not busy at all. How can someone who dated you for 2 years and showed so much affection and care evenn during the breakup period and be like this now??

Every time I and my bf of 6 months are together, he can't tell me enough of how much he loves me, how much I mean to him, etc.  He has even said that someday he could see us married.   I have met all his friends and his 2 kids.  We have some beautiful times together and he is so romantic... I have not met his parents since they live out of town, but he says he's talked to them about me.   Here's what's weird and confusing to me:  When we are apart, our phone calls last only minutes, he does not respond much to my romantic text messages or emails, and usually he falls asleep at night so early that he doesn't even call me at night.  I almost always go to his place, he hardly comes to mine.  Also, he's sort of a home body...when we were first dating we would go out a lot, and now anytime I ask him to do something with me, he'll reply that he doesn't really feel like it or that he's just going to chill at home.     I guess I just feel as if I'm out of sight, out of mind.

20090308075504AA770Ex	Family & Relationships;Friends	I flooded this girls basement!  Should I worry?	There is this girl named Jane that I really hate... over the last year we have gotten into so many fights I can't even remember.  So I started dating her ex and she got angry and pushed me into a table at a party, she fought me in the washroom and I smashed a bottle of perfume on her head and knocked her out, she threw at the public transit bus window while I was going to the mall and it smashed the window, and I got angry once and I went to her party and I poured vodka in her fireplace and her house almost caught fire.      We are only 14...  The vodka was her dads and it was on the ground and she was swearing so much at me so I grabbed the vodka bottle and I opened it and poured it into the fireplace and the fire got so big she screamed and omg it was soooo jkzzzzzzzz!       But I wanted to like settle this feud between us.  Friday was the FINAL volleyball game of the season and I was up against Jane's team.  Three of my teammates did NOT show up.  So I had to go up against Jane's team.  But I run sooo fast and I just like smack the ball so hard and we beat her team.  Then I found my friends locked in the change room and someone shoved a tennis racket in the doorhandle so it couldn't open.  They said it was Jane.      So like yeah, we fought so much and she was like fine lets be friends.  I was like whatever.  So she said she is having a party and so many other grade 9's are coming so I should too.  I went.      Ok so my BESSSSTTTT friend Courtney went.  But my boyfriend didn't go since he is Jane's ex.  So we went and Jane was so nice and she gave us drinks and seated us.  Then she called me in and she was like okkk Ashley can you help me with the pizza? And I said sure and she told me to run to pizza pizza and pick it up.  I thought she wanted me to make it :S  So I ran to pizza pizza and picked it up and ran back.  Then she served it (I had to carry like 6 boxes of PIZZA!)  Everyone ate and I ate and I drank pepsi and I went into the kitchen.  So Jane started acting all rude and stuff and shes like shes bringing the cake.  I went in and I ate cake and drank more then Jane started dancing.      I reallllllllllly wanted to mess her house up.  So I went to the kitchen, and like RIGHT behind the countertop with the sink and stuff, there is a vent in the floor.  I opened it up and I dropped some forks and knives inside.  Then I saw that her sink has a hose attached to it which squirts water.  So I started to squirt water into the vent.  Like three minutes later Jane came and I panicked I didnt want her to see me!  So I hid behind the fridge.  She grabbed some brownies and left.      So I took masking tape and I tied it around the trigger of the hose so water keeps coming out by it self.  Then I put it next to the vent and water KEPT going into the vent.  So I went to the living room and I stayed there for like 10 minutes.  Then I went back into the kitchen and I saw the vent was sooo full!  Water literally began to come out!  So I stopped it and then I put a towel on the floor and dried it.  Ok so Jane was like its getting cool so she is going to start the heat.  I was sooo worried that was going to make the house blow up!  So I said I'll do it for you but I never did.      I grabbed my things and I was ready to leave but then as I was about to leave, I realized that water was coming out of the vent in the dining room!  So I ran to the basement and I looked around.  The vent was like shaking and I tapped it with my nails and water dripped out.  Then as I was walking out I realized there was like a big puddle of water.  As I was going upstairs the vent kept making this weird rattling noise.      I panicked and I ran out.      Will her house blow up?  I read on Facebook last night during the party her house caught fire and there was a picture of a fire!

20090308065624AAi8oVF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boyfriend admitted missing ex when drunk?	I have been with a new boyfriend for a few months now, and we have a good relationship, but he is kinda uptight and doesn't like to talk about his feelings.      Before we got together, he was married and cheated on his wife with a secretary from his work (not with me). When he finished with her cos he felt guilty she sent his wife a really nasty letter telling her everything, and they got divorced. This is something that he feels really bad about and still beats himself up a lot about. Now, the other night we went out and he got really drunk, and when we got home the drink seems to have loosened his tongue and he mentioned the girl he cheated with. I started asking him questions as it is rare that he will talk about this stuff, and he admitted that sometimes he misses her and he especially misses the sex. I said that if he still has feelings for her maybe they should try again, but he said that it wouldn't work as she was too insecure and there was too much bad water under the bridge.      What should I think of this? What should I do? Does it mean he doesn't love me?

20090308062802AADg4nw	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I am too embarrassed by oral sex and I don't know what to do?	Basically, I am 17, have lost my virginity and stuff, that's all fine, however, I am absolutely terrified of my boyfriend giving me oral sex, i'm fine doing it on him, I actually enjoy it, however I am so embarrassed to get it myself, I just feel it is so unattractive down there and what if it tastes really bad? I hate that area of my body and the idea of being so exposed just makes me cringe. It's difficult because i've recently got a new boyfriend who's quite experienced and wants to try all this stuff like 69 etc, and i'm just absolutely terrified to, I do WANT to, of course i do, i bet it feels amazing, but i'm so scared i'm abnormaly ugly down there and he'll run a mile. What do I do? Is there anything I CAN do that'll put my mind at rest?
20090308083529AA5ZEgb	Family & Relationships;Family	Can anyone tell me what to expect at a "risk assessment"?	Hi I'm just looking for some info on what I might be asked etc at a social work risk assessment meeting. My sister in law's 2 gorgeous boys were taken into emergency care last week and I called social services to ask if the boys could come to me. I was told that I wasn't allowed to know where they were or even phone them, but that the social worker would bring me in on their risk assessment, presumably to see if I am fit to look after them. The situation with my sister in law has been ongoing for years. She has neglected them from birth, and her mother and brother and I have always picked up the pieces. I reported her to social services as soon as it became clear that she would not accept offers of help, it broke my heart but the kids had to come first. My partner (her brother) and his Mum also reported her on several occasions. Social services did nothing for years, than last year there was a serious incident with her involving the police. The police called social services and they finally took an interest, culminating in the boy's removal from her last week. I just want to know what to expect, as I am scared that all the social worker wants from us is proof that the boys were neglected, and that we wont be given custody of them at all. I think that keeping kids with family members is a priority where possible for social services but I keep thinking of heartbreaking horror stories where this hasn't happened. Any insight or advice is appreciated. Thanks.

20090308064804AACbFBf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it ok to remain friends witha girl who rejected you?	I'm still into this girl and I do still wanna be with her. But she rejected me after telling me that she liked me, but she's confused and apparently doesn't know what she wants. She says she likes to talk to me for hours on the phone and how I flirt with her, how I look at her and all that, but she says that she only wanna remain friends. Whenever I'm around her I'm a bit weak, which is understandable a bit. But my friends are advising me to stop giving her any sort of attention for my own good. Now, besides the fact that I'm having an extremely hard time getting over liking her, is it wrong to remain friends with a girl you like and she knows that you still like her? I mean some people tell me give it up man, save your pride, and others tell me if you really want her, don't let go. I'm just all confused about what should I do...can anybody give me any valuable advice here?

20090308071443AAV963P	Family & Relationships;Friends	How to deal with a passive aggressive friend?	Has anyone ever had a very close friend who resented you, and there was nothing you could do about it? This girl is really one of my best friends, and I hang out with her probably more than anyone else. We met each other at work back in 2006, but didn't really get to be such good friends until we became roommates briefly a couple years ago. We are both in our mid-20s, if that's important at all.      Anyway, this always was sort of a problem but never a big deal until last summer, and after then its just been snowballing. She broke up with her long-term boyfriend last July, and sort of latched on to me after that because she didn't have anyone else. She's very insecure, so I completely understood and was totally supportive of her. But it started getting really annoying, because she began copying me... like everything about me: my clothes, my makeup, my opinions, my jokes, etc. We would be hanging out in a group of people, and she'd spend the whole time literally verbatim repeating things I've said before, and pass them off as her own ideas or jokes. It really bothered me but I never knew how to bring it up without sounding petty, so I just kinda ignored it because it wasn't harming anyone.      So the months passed, and lately she's been saying some really ****** up things to me. They're always sort of under-the-breath comments, usually trying to undercut my self-esteem. Like insisting that guys I'm dating aren't really into me, or that I'm not pretty, or implying I'm stupid, etc. I have specific examples, but its little intentionally hurtful things like that, things I would never say to anyone, let alone a good friend. And these things started escalating, to the point where I could feel her animosity just oozing out whenever she was around. I tried talking to her, nicely asking if there was anything I had done, and she flipped out, yelling and crying. She then said that yes, I have been a terrible friend, but when I asked her what it was I had been doing so I could apologize, she said she couldn't think of any examples. So... I apologized anyway for apparently having been a terrible person, and we both agreed that we were cool again. But within a couple days she was back to the same **** again. Oh, but this hasn't stopped her from continually copying everything I wear, say, or do.      Has anyone ever had a friend like this? I hesitate to just blow it off as jealousy, but I just don't get why anyone would act like this. It really makes me feel like ****, and I keep trying to think of anything I could have done or said, but there is nothing. I have never been hurtful to her, and it is eating away at me to think I am losing one of my closest friends, at a point in my life where I don't feel like I have many. She is just so passive aggressive that I feel like there is no hope of ever solving it. And anytime I try to gradually talk to her less, she comes around and acts really nice and kiss-assy, which makes me feel like a jerk for trying to distance myself.      Does anyone have any advice on dealing with this? Thanks...

20090308080140AA7YJBe	Family & Relationships;Friends	My friends all have experience, I don't.?	ok, well all of my friends have had their share of boyfriends and kisses and all of that.   i've done nothing.   all i've done was hug my boyfriend.   i've only had one boyfriend.   but that's pretty good considering my town is gross, and all the boys are jerks.   some of my friends have never had a boyfriend at all.   but the ones who've had are.. well. im not sure how to explain.   they always talk about people who haven't had their first kiss. and i don't think they realize i haven't either.   so i just sit there and put in my voice at times too.   should i be feeling stupid right now, or just be proud that i haven't kissed or done anything with someone i didn't truly like?

20090308081145AAcpVyd	Family & Relationships;Family	How do I tell my parents that I want to go back in diapers?	I'm 14 years old and all I can think about is how sweet it would be if I wore disposable diapers all the time. I know it's crazy, but that's all I can think about. What can I do about this? I don't know if my parents would go for it. They'd probably send me to a psychiatrist.
20090308080020AA7mXf9	Family & Relationships;Family	Parents are too controlling...?	I'm 15 years old, have a 4.0 GPA, and am in the top 3% of my class. However, this isn't good enough for my parents, who control my life too much. Every time I don't get a perfect grade on something, they call me 'stupid' and 'idiot' and a 'shame to the family.' I really can't handle this anymore. The only thing they talk about with me is grades, testing, and college. They say the same thing over and over again, "Look at [this person], she made it to HARVARD. Why isn't our daughter so smart?" They constantly compare me to other people, which isn't really reasonable, because my academic profile is very strong, I do 2 sports and one at the varsity level, play 5 different instruments, have made All-State, and love volunteering (I've got 300 hours). They won't see anything that I have done, instead, they freak out whenever I do something that isn't perfect. I'm not even allowed to go on Facebook anymore, they go straight to the Internet administrator and see what time and which sites I go on EVERY SINGLE DAY. What's worse, some of their controlling stuff has nothing to do with academics. Just 5 minutes ago, I went outside to play tennis wearing a short-sleeved t-shirt and sweatpants. They were furious and called me back inside, forcing me to wear a thick jacket, under armour, and leggings. I couldn't wear them, I felt like I'd suffocate from wearing too much (It's 70 degrees outside). They gave me a lecture, screaming in my face for about half an hour, and even... hit me a few times. This is a small thing, but I really can't take their perfectionist ways anymore. I try my best to be perfect, and think I'm more successful when I'm doing things ON MY OWN. I like being independent and living a freer life. Whenever I do something, I also have to think about my parents' reactions first. I haven't gone to a sleepover since 5th grade, I've never been out with my friends, and I'm not allowed to date anyone till I'm in college or graduate school. I'm a teenager, I should have just a little bit of fun in my life. I know I'll probably get a bunch of replies saying that "Oh, you're not 18 yet, so your parents would naturally do that. Wah wah wah." I really, really, need help. Please tell me what I should do.

20090308080633AAU0ibo	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I take my husband back?	My husband and I have been married for nearly 7 years. We have one son. We have had an up and down marriage for quite a while. In December of 08, I made him leave. I started seeing someone that I worked with, and couldn't have been happier. However, this guy I work with is deploying to Afghanistan currently. He and I decided to be friends while he is gone, and see where things are when he comes back in a year to 18 months. I have a big problem with being lonely. I am still on good terms with my husband, our divorce isn't final, and we get along wonderfully since he has moved out. I know part of me still loves him, and wonders if I should take him back. However, the other part of me is glad to have this freedom and wants to see what will happen with my "friend" when he comes back. What am I supposed to do??????

20090308091016AA7qStP	Family & Relationships;Friends	Temporary roommate how do I resolve issues nicely?	Tuesday I got a call from my fiance asking if one of his friends could stay with us for a week while his new apartment got sorted out.       Turns out my Definition of " sorting out" and his are two different things. I thought it meant that the apartment just had to be made move in ready. To my fiance "Sorted out" meant that his friend needed to find an apartment.       His friend is nice enough but there are a few things that bother me, and having never had roommates before I don't really know the diplomacy of resolving issues.       The big one is personal hygiene. Now I'm not a domestic goddess by any means. I will admit my house is often pretty cluttered. While my house may not be the cleanest I take issue with smells so my home doesn't smell and personal hygiene is pretty important in my book.       My Fiance's pal smells plain and simple. I don't think he's showered since coming to stay with us and he hasn't changes his clothes.  I can tell my fiance that he needs to go take a shower but I have no idea how to tell this guy he needs to get clean. I've tried hinting, I let him know that I put fresh unused towels in the bath room for him in case he wanted to shower. I bought new body wash and soap and let him know where it was.  I don't know what else to do, and I don't want to embarrass him by outright saying " you smell get a shower."      The clothes issue doesn't help the smell either. The guy has fallen on pretty hard times. He lost his last apartment and lost his job  all he came with was a back pack and there has been mention of two or three boxes of stuff being stored somewhere. ( which I have suggested my fiance bring to our house) I don't know if he brought a change of clothes with him.  I've talked to my fiance about this issue a few times and his only suggestion was I offer to wash his clothes next time I do laundry. To me that isn't a solution because I'm not his mother. It's bad enough I'm cleaning up after the two of them and cooking their meals I'm not adding on laundry.    I'm very tempted to go down to wal-mart and pick up some socks and underwear and find some used clothing on Freecycle and just leave it in his room. But again I don't want to embarrass him.       The other issue is I don't know how long he's staying. My Fiance told me a week but so far I haven't heard any mention of apartment hunting or anything.  Right now he doesn't have a job so he spends his days playing video games and on the computer. He does try to help around the house. A few times he's cleaned out the dishwasher and he's fed the cats before we get home from university or work. ( He figured he had to because they started driving him crazy)       I feel like it's me my Fiance and my teenage son. I don't mind him staying here for a week or so but is it really too much to ask him to be upfront with his plans , keep himself clean, and maybe help out a bit more?      My fiance wants to get a roommate when I'm away for my year work term. He's been thinking about asking this guy to stay with him. This worries me because while the guy means well he really isn't that reliable.       Can someone help me.

My friend has recently been going to allot of raves and he has been getting high and doing ecstasy. I just talked to him today and he was on ecstasy and I felt bad. I don't want to tell him something because he will think that I am "boring" and continue what his doing anyways and never tell me anything again. I just feel like he is throwing his life away at such a young age of 18 and he is headed toward nowhere. he feels that the only happiness in his life is to go to the next rave.

He wants to get married when he gets back, But the thought of him not coming back home scares the **** out of me. I will be having a csection, so I would want him to get back for that.

20090308084855AATf7Gh	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do most spouses have the stamina of a male praying mantis?	Many of us will have heard that the female praying mantis may eat the male after sex. What is little known though, is that she may eat his head during sex (WARNING – don’t try this at home). What is interesting is that he manages to keep going and finish the job, something that hasn’t been tested in humans but many women reportedly suspect the human male just might be capable of the same stamina. My husband told me that is how he wants to go when he goes! How do you think humans compare?

20090308084316AAnxrnY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	What would you do i'll give 10 pts to best answer Updated details?	If you denied the good guy which was your friend because you had a bf who hits you and treated you bad (And is also a Drugi he does alot of drugs and still does as of today). She also lost virginity with him at 15 . Wanted to stay with the bad guy, and you stop talking because you tried to save her and she called you out for being jealous ( she was a total ***** to me always being fd up towards me she will bring her anger out on me). We also did mess around and kissed around back then. "Oh and one time, she tried to get with my own cousin while she had a man, and me"!. So years later you see your friend that would have treated you like a queen rolling in a lamborghini and living good.         I would like her to see me, and then to be like "Omg like what have i've done i could have done better"!.         I em that guy, and i had not seen her in years but i know where she lives. She was my first loved one. I also heard she has a kid but i em not sure. The again i'm affraid i'll land in the same spot i was before what should i do?

But it doesn't seem like that matters. We've been friends for 2 years, he's great and we've always managed to be real close friends.    The problem is, he's gorgeous and has a ton of other friends. Just recently, he's started calling me babe, baby, stuff like that. Pretty much acting as if we were dating. He always tells me he loves me, and i'm not sure what to think anymore. I love him dearly, as a friend, and I hope he's not trying to either lead me on, or play a joke on me or something immature like that.    It's really been bugging me recently, and also, because he has so many friends, I'm not sure how many other girls he says that to. so I don't know if i should take him seriously or not. Plus, I doubt he actually 'likes me'. It doesnt really seem possible, thinking of the other choices he has, but crazy things happen?    So, i'm not sure. Any ideas?    Please, mature responses only.   thank you so much   xx

I would like to make most of my senior year, at least the time that i have left in school. I would like to build a friendship with a particular girl in my school who isnt in my grade. But meeting new people scares me, especially when approaching a girl who is always with her girl friends. I'm , smart, with good grades and aspirations, but in terms of being more social, making new friend seems like a daunting task. I mean, I get along with all my classmates, even the girl who are pretty and hot. But I can't seem to approach this girl that I would like to have a friendship with and go out in the summers before I go to college. what can I do?

20090308083933AA2Rc2A	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why hasn't my boyfriend proposed?	My long-distance boyfriend and I have been dating for a year.He was so enthusiastic about moving here,getting married, and raising a family. But now after difficult job search he doesn't mention it that much. We went to Chicago for vacation this past week. I thought he would propose but he didn't. I know.a year is short but long-distance is very hard to me, not to him.      A little bit background about me and him. I got to know him right after I accepted a job offer and resigned from my previous job.I'm on a tenure-track position in a university and my job opportunity is very scanty because my major is highly specialized.Plus I'm on my working visa which makes it very difficult for me to land a job easily. If I move back I have to leave academia which I hate to do. But I told him that I'm willing to compmise if he can't find a job here.I know that he has to leave behind his daughter(12 yrs old), mother, well-established job, and house once he moves here. He's very close to his daughter and mother. We love each other very much but sometimes I can't understand some of his behavior. We talk every day and we do the calling/messaging half and half between me and him. But whenever he's with his daughter and/or mom he didn't call. I met with his family and it seems that they like me a lot. But I still get jealous of his daughter and mom because he sees them more often than me. I'm the one moving away and I felt lonely and miss him like crazy. I feel like he can't understand how hard it is for a foreigner to establish everything-especially social netwokrs- in a country she didn't have any friends or family. I still haven't found a close friend here.      Neither of us is willing to quit our jobs, especially given that the economy is in such a bad shape. It's riskier for me to do so because I just started my green card application process with my employer which will take three or four years. Without a green card I'll be out of legal status immediately if I'm out of job. I hope that we can get married so that I can have my working authorization card independent of employers.Then it'll be easier for me to look for jobs in his place. But he doesn't get it and want to wait to get married until we're in the same place.       Long story short, so if he loves me very much-I know he does-why can't he propose and we get married so that I can try to find a job there easier? Then he doesn't have to give up everything. I love him very much that I can give up my dream career to be with him sooner. I'm in my early 30s (he's in his early 40s) but my clock is ticking in terms of having healthy children. Why can't he be considerate and think the same way? I can't sense the eagerness in him. Is he too comfortable to maintain his long-term bachelor status (he only married briefly) in a city he lived for 40 years or am I too available? We take turns to visit each other once a month and I'm a very understanding person. I didn't lose my coolness when he didn't call me when he was busy, etc. I cry every time we were apart from the visit but he seems not emotional at all. He went to Mama's house for dinner last night right after he went back home from Chicago. He didn't call when I had to be alone with my dogs in a city I don't have friends nor family.   He's looking for jobs here but I sense he doesn't do it diligently.      What should I do to make him feel the need to propose,to be eager to find ways to unite, and get married? I need to keep my sanity intact because long-distance itself is already very stressful, not to mention adding the stress of changing jobs etc. Haven't slept much last night. Thanks for reading the long story and any opinions are welcome.
20090308084002AA3teaK	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My boyfriend has a tendency to want my attention one day why then for the next week just totally avoid me?	My boyfriend for three years off and on has a tendency to confuse my emotions by wanting my attention one day and then for the next week or two just totally ignore and avoid me by not returning my calls etc. As soon as I stop calling him and start playing his game (so to speak)he wants to talk to me again. Why does he do this? He says he loves me but I feel like he is just playing games with me. Can there be any explanation for this sort of behavior he is displaying towards me. Guys have you ever done this to your girlfriend?
20090308084007AAZzfZ4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you do if you're in love with a girl but you know you should move on?	I know many people have experienced this same problem because I hear it in lyrics to music all the time, but I have no idea what the solution is.      What do you do if you're in love with a girl but she's more or less told you to wait. It's not that she's seeing other people, just being together  won't work out right now though it may later. Do you wait and risk her possibly meeting someone else while you're waiting or do you forget her and try to love someone else?      I would move on but I'm seeing her again in a few months, but if I were to sincerely move on now then I wouldn't feel the same way about her.      Just thought I'd poll some minds on the topic =)
20090308084716AAljw6n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i give my ex gf the gift i promised her?	my gf an i broke up 8 months ago and we really haven't talked since.  I promised her when we were dating i would buy her this gift and i saw it the other day and bought for some reason i don't know why.  She parks next to me in school every day and its weird cuz i thought she hated me but she always parks next to me.  Should i just put the gift on her car and see what she does or just forget about giving it to her?

20090308085024AA9K40x	Family & Relationships;Family	My sister had her period and didn't tell me, should i let her know that i understand?	I'm the sole guardian of my 13 year old sister. I found out this week that she had her period last month, her auntie told me because she thought i should know. We live with her other 2 older brothers 20 and 16 and i am 23. Shes very mature, (she had to grow up fast after loosing both our parents) so i assumed she would tell us. Is this something that she needs to do her self? or should i say something?
20090308085435AAKH0ON	Family & Relationships;Friends	If your ex won't reply to a message?	i went out with this guy a while ago and there was a misunderstanding that led to a break-up. we were friends for a while after that and then he just randomly got mad @ me and we stopped talking. we were fine again and then the same thing happened where he got mad. i havent talked to him in a while, but i was going to hang out with my friend and her bf and i didnt want to be the third wheel, so i asked him if he wanted to come. he couldnt because he was out of town, but then we started talking. then just yesterday i replied to his message and he hasnt replied back (he's always on). does he want to talk to me anymore or does he not want to seem like he still likes me or something?
20090308085702AAyeNnU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What does it mean when girls wear pop can tabs around their neck?	I'm 30 years old.  When I was 15 or 16-ish, when you popped the tab off a pop can and gave it to a girl or boy, it stood for a f**k.  Is that still what it means?  Our babysitter is 16 and she's got 4-5 that she wears with a couple other trinkits around her neck.  Does that mean that she's getting laid?
20090308090158AAhwLHv	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Ex husband who has people follow me..?	I have been divorced for about 3 years now. Clearly he had moved on with another woman, but everytime they fight or break up he harasses me. I'm at my witts end with this man. I can't even go out, without someone taking pictures of me and getting back to him. I have no privacy whats so ever. Then he calls me or has our daughter ask me all these questions..If I'm correct we are divorced, and I have a right to have a life. I go out once in a blue moon, and when I'am he always finds out where I 'am and what I'm doing. My friends don't even want to go out with me anymore because of him. Is it me, or am I being stocked. He blackmales me and says I will never see my kids ever again. He told me he would make sure I have nothing. What am I to do. Im a prisoner in my own home again..
