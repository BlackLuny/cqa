Are you serious?!<br>  <br>  As you would know (actually you might NOT know this...), 1998 was the peak of a strong el-nino cycle. 2000 was the bottom of that cycle, the la nina. 2005 almost topped 1998 for global temps despite a much weaker el-nino cycle, and 2007-2008 was the most recent la-nina.<br>  <br>  The 2007-08 la-nina bottom was much warmer than the previous in 2000. We're now about to head into another el-nino peak. <br>  <br>  It amazes me how denialists like yourself use the very contentious state of global temps to not only deny AGW, but global warming full stop.<br>  <br>  You're seriously painting yourself into a corner.

They crunch the numbers and report the facts and I can guarantee you that every scientist out there who is proving AGW would like nothing more than to be wrong and would be happy to admit it because the future at this stage is bleak the way things are going. The weight of evidence at this stage suggests that the deniers and skeptics are wrong at this stage.

Several years (2000, 2002, 2003, 2004) fell well down the leaderboard, behind even 1900.

CE4hcUmhaa	An extremely simple answer to your question is that the nuclear energy is converted to steam energy (the heat generated by the nuclear fission is used to heat water) which in turn is used to drive a turbine generator (mechanical energy) which in turn produces electricity.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of intermediate steps and processes, depending on the type of reactor and which safety measures have been added to the system, but that is those are the basics.|`|y0MnsQRNaa	Despite all the cosmic energy that the word "nuclear" invokes, power plants that depend on atomic energy don't operate that differently from a typical coal-burning power plant. Both heat water into pressurized steam, which drives a turbine generator. The key difference between the two plants is the method of heating the water. While coal plants burn fossil fuels, nuclear plants depend on the heat that occurs during nuclear fission, when one atom splits into two.<br>  There are several components common to most types of reactors:<br>  <br>  Fuel. Usually ceramic pellets of uranium oxide (UO2) arranged in Zirconium steel alloy tubes to form fuel rods. The rods are arranged into fuel assemblies in the reactor core.<br>  <br>  Moderator. This is material which slows down the neutrons released from fission so that they cause more fission. It is usually water, but may be heavy water or graphite.<br>  <br>  Control rods. These are made with neutron-absorbing material such as silver, cadmium, hafnium or boron, and are inserted or withdrawn from the core to control the rate of reaction, or to halt it. (Secondary shutdown systems involve adding other neutron absorbers, usually boron in the primary cooling system.) This controls the average temperature and allows extra fuel to be added for a extended time between refueling.<br>  <br>  Coolant. A liquid or gas circulating through the core so as to transfer the heat from it. In light water reactors the moderator functions also as coolant.<br>  <br>  Pressure vessel or pressure tubes. Usually a robust steel vessel containing the reactor core and moderator/coolant, but it may be a series of tubes holding the fuel and conveying the coolant through the moderator.<br>  <br>  Steam generator. Part of the cooling system in Pressurized Water Reactors where the heat from the reactor is used to make steam for the turbine. Some reactor designs, called  Boiling Water Reactors, do not have S/Gs but instead allow boiling in the reactor core to produce steam for the turbine..<br>  <br>  Containment. The structure around the reactor core which is designed to protect it from outside intrusion and to protect those outside from the effects of radiation in case of any major malfunction inside. It is typically a meter (3ft.) thick  concrete and steel structure designed to be air/water tight to prevent any leak to the environment in the worst case Loss Of Coolant accident.<br>  <br>  Most reactors need to be shut down for refueling, so that the pressure vessel can be opened up. In this case refueling is at intervals of 1-2 years, when a quarter to a third of the fuel assemblies are replaced with fresh ones. The CANDU and RBMK types have pressure tubes (rather than a pressure vessel enclosing the reactor core) and can be refueled while still generating electricity by disconnecting individual pressure tubes.<br>  <br>  If graphite or heavy water is used as moderator, it is possible to run a power reactor on natural instead of enriched uranium. Natural uranium has the same elemental composition as when it was mined (0.7% U-235, over 99.2% U-238), enriched uranium has had the proportion of the fissile isotope (U-235) increased by a process called enrichment, commonly to 3.5 - 5.0%. In this case the moderator can be ordinary water, and such reactors are collectively called light water reactors. Because the light water absorbs neutrons as well as slowing them, it is less efficient as a moderator than heavy water or graphite.<br>  <br>  Practically all fuel is ceramic uranium oxide (UO2 with a melting point of 2800°C) and most is enriched. The fuel pellets (usually about 1 cm diameter and 1.5 cm long) are typically arranged in a long zirconium alloy (zircaloy) tube to form a fuel rod, the zirconium being hard, corrosion-resistant and permeable to neutrons. Up to 264 rods form a fuel assembly, which is an open lattice and can be lifted into and out of the reactor core. In the most common reactors these are about 3.5-4.0 meters (3ft.) long.<br>  The  uranium 235 in these pellets absorb slowed down (moderated or thermal) neutrons, becoming unstable U-236 which splits, creating; heat, gamma, neutrons, and fission fragments. The heat generated can be calculated from the mass loss in the fission process equal to the famous equation E=MC squared, also known as binding energy. The energy released from a single fuel pellet is equivalent to the energy released burning 1 ton of coal.<br>  The links below have some excellent detailed information and graphics about nuclear power. I hope this helps you to de-mystify nuclear power, it really isn't that complicated, and is a safe, reliable, environmentally friendly, economical, energy source.

Most of them think: "the planet is not warming" and/or "the planet is warming but it is natural" and/or "humans are causing a little warming but it can only be beneficial". And yes, there are a few who make all three contradictory claims. <br>  <br>  A lot of them get offended by the word "denier" because they feel it is a derogatory term that groups them in with "holocaust deniers", which personally I would have never thought of.

"Contrarian" is what I like to use.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	A denier is somebody who's in denial.

Or a denier tries to blame the Sun for the recent global warming, when the data clearly show that solar output hasn't increased in well over 30 years.<br>  <br>  It's somebody who denies scientific facts.  And contrary to what some people will claim, it has nothing to do with Holocaust deniers, except that both are in denial about something.<br>  <br>  They prefer to be called "skeptics", but a skeptic is a person who is open-minded and questions both sides of an issue, which deniers are not and do not.  Sometimes the term "delayer" is used because they want to delay action on addressing global warming.  "Contrarian" is another, as Dawei notes.<br>  <br>  In my opinion denier is the most accurate term, so that's what I use.  I don't particularly care if they don't like it.

MGHTJx0Waa	Advantages of nuclear power generation:<br>  Nuclear power generation does emit relatively low amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2). The emissions of green house gases and therefore the contribution of nuclear power plants to global warming is therefore relatively little.<br>  This technology is readily available, it does not have to be developed first.<br>  It is possible to generate a high amount of electrical energy in one single plant.<br>   <br>  <br>  Disadvantages of nuclear power generation:<br>  <br>  The problem of radioactive waste is still an unsolved one. The waste from nuclear energy is extremely dangerous and it has to be carefully looked after for several thousand years (10'000 years according to United States Environmental Protection Agency standards).<br>  High risks: Despite a generally high security standard, accidents can still happen. It is technically impossible to build a plant with 100% security. A small probability of failure will always last. The consequences of an accident would be absolutely devastating both for human being as for the nature (see here , here or here ). The more nuclear power plants (and nuclear waste storage shelters) are built, the higher is the probability of a disastrous failure somewhere in the world. <br>  Nuclear power plants as well as nuclear waste could be preferred targets for terrorist attacks. No atomic energy plant in the world could withstand an attack similar to 9/11 in Yew York. Such a terrorist act would have catastrophic effects for the whole world.<br>  During the operation of nuclear power plants, radioactive waste is produced, which in turn can be used for the production of nuclear weapons. In addition, the same know-how used to design nuclear power plants can to a certain extent be used to build nuclear weapons (nuclear proliferation).<br>  The energy source for nuclear energy is Uranium. Uranium is a scarce resource, its supply is estimated to last only for the next 30 to 60 years depending on the actual demand.<br>  The time frame needed for formalities, planning and building of a new nuclear power generation plant is in the range of 20 to 30 years in the western democracies. In other words: It is an illusion to build new nuclear power plants in a short time.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Sustainability: Is nuclear energy sustainable?<br>  <br>  For several reasons, nuclear power is neither ?green? nor sustainable:<br>  <br>  <br>  Both the nuclear waste as well as retired nuclear plants are a life-threatening legacy for hundreds of future generations. It flagrantly contradicts with the thoughts of sustainability if future generations have to deal with dangerous waste generated from preceding generations. See also here .<br>  <br>  Uranium, the source of energy for nuclear power, is available on earth only in limited quantities. Uranium is being ?consumed? (i.e. converted) during the operation of the nuclear power plant so it won't be available any more for future generations. This again contradicts the principle of sustainability.<br>   <br>  <br>  Is nuclear power renewable energy?<br>  Nuclear energy uses Uranium as fuel, which is a scarce resource. The supply of Uranium is expected to last only for the next 30 to 60 years (depending on the actual demand). Therefore nuclear energy is not a renewable energy. <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Conclusion <br>   <br>  <br>  From the above mentioned pros and cons of nuclear power plants, it should be evident that nuclear energy cannot be a solution to any problem. Even worse: it is the source of many further problems.<br>  <br>  <br>  We must not any longer shut our eyes to the consequences of our being on earth. Besides moral, ethical and spiritual reasons, at least for the pure will to survive we should consequently strive for a sustainable living and realize it in our personal life. It's time for change!<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  The actual interests of the energy industry in nuclear power <br>  <br>  Generally speaking, the electrical energy industry is aware of the substantial drawbacks of nuclear power generation. Nevertheless this industry is now spending an incredible amount of money and time, lobbying for the revival of nuclear energy. The main interest of the owners of existing nuclear power plants is however to prolong the life-span for existing nuclear plants. Because the existing plants will be amortised at the end of their originally planned life time, huge financial profits can be realised for any day longer which these plants can be kept in operation. This is much more lucrative than building new nuclear plants!<br>  <br>  <br>  However, to operate nuclear power plants longer than originally planned can be quite dangerous since any plant or technical appliance usually gets more troublesome towards the end of its planned life expectancy.|`|6Vaaqle0aa	Pros<br>  Fuel (uranium etc) does not need to be changed for a long while<br>  Easier than most other energy sources<br>  Faster to obtain and change to electricity<br>  No waste in fossil fuels<br>  Uranium has a larger renewability than fossil fuels<br>  <br>  Cons<br>  Dangerous if leaked<br>  Nowhere to place waste products<br>  Large facilities need to be built<br>  Larger safety inspections, (to stop leaks)<br>  If leaked, entire facility lost and all has to abandoned|`|qFTZ6ypyaa	Pros: It is said to be cleaner than coal.

It does not take too many degrees increase for the seas to dry up;  I suppose we could argue that this would offset the rise in sea-level, ha ha.  <br>  <br>  I hate to say it but go see Al Gore's inconvenient truth, write down those things you don't like to hear, and then go and researchthem separately.  Most universities are wonderfully willing to inform anyone who asks what their research outcomes are, I've never found them less than pleased to have inquiries.  <br>  <br>  Treat this thing like a debate.  Inform yourself your own way, and your conclusions will be solid as a rock.  <br>  <br>  I obviously 'believe' in global warming (although I must say, it's not a religion!) but you have to find your own way via investigation and primary gathering of your own knowledge.
4CMENEKnaa	No.  The escape velocity is too high compared to the average speed of N2 and O2 molecules.  <br>  <br>  CO2 is increasing because humans are burning fossil fuels.  Move on.<br>  <br>  Edit:  I didn't say they can't escape, I said the escape velocity is too high relative to the average speed of N2 and O2 molecules.  This is atmospheric science 101.  See here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/larson/Astro150b/CoursePak/cp19_atmos_esc.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.astro.washington.edu/users/la...</a><br>  <br>  As an aside, this is why skeptics get ignored.  They continually revisit known physics and act as if atmospheric scientists have never considered them before.  This question was settled before I was born, the average velocity of N2 and O2 is too low for them to escape to space.  If you don't believe me, run the worksheet yourself above.  The bottom line is that you are barking up a wrong tree, the increase in CO2 in the atmosphere is not due to other gases being removed through escape to space.  <br>  <br>  Move on.

It is an independent documentary that is not in a large number of locations so you might have to look around to see where it is playing.  Pay special attention on the explanation that gasoline actually costs about twice what we actually pay for at the pump.  Also rent or buy Al Gore's film "An Inconvenient Truth".  <br>  Obama initially wants to reduce energy usage such that we do not need to import any oil, sounds simple but it is actually rather bold.  He wants to do it by developing alternate sources of energy.  He intends to reinstate the environment rules including decreasing emissions, including CO2 and others.  <br>  Since the economy is going to take up alot of time, the environment will probably take a back seat although some laws will be passed under the radar.  <br>  Now to correct some statements of others.  <br>  To Natta T:<br>  Your comment about taxing the rich and giving it to those poor that want welfare is off subject and also wrong.  The stimulus package doesn't mention welfare, it adds funding to unemployment.  And the unemployment funding is NOT paid from citizens rich or poor, it is from taxes only on businesses, namely employment tax.  I do not believe he stated a percentage of reduction and surely he did not say 90%.  As for Germany, they actually beat their goal.  One of the ways they did it is that they reduced taxes on biodiesel and biofuels.  A much larger percentage of cars in Germany and other european countries have diesel engines which can use either diesel from oil or biodiesel with no modifications.  <br>  BTW, in the four years of the Jimmy Carter administration, the US reduced its energy consumption by over 25%, and Ronald Reagan all but killed the entire project. <br>  To Morpheus<br>  Although Nixon signed and later embraced the EPA, he initially was not that much in favor of it.

20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	Global warming is not about opinion, it's about science.<br>  <br>  Gore's film has come under some criticism not because it contains incorrect information, but rather because some of the points made in the film were not precise enough.  For example, Gore talked about large-scale sea level rise, but did not discuss the fact that this won't happen for a long time.  There are several such examples where the film was technically accurate, but could have been clearer.<br>  <br>  However, the British judge who reviewed the film and found 9 such minor errors (out of the hundreds of points made in the film) also ruled the film is "substantially founded upon scientific research and fact" and "Al Gore's presentation of the causes and likely effects of climate change in the film was broadly accurate." <br>  <br>  The film got the basic science right, so it's approprate to show in schools.|`|6Gfz125Paa	I don't think there is anything wrong with it.

FZmu6Pm9aa	What I love is the few who try to claim that the cooling is just masking the warming, which is evidently still ongoing. If that's the case then that's a good thing, since cooling at the rate of 3.6 degrees Celsius per century would be very severe and without that warming in the background we might be experiencing the return of the ice age. So, by the same logic "we're losing money at a record rate but our profits will keep us afloat", try that on Wall Street and see where it gets you.<br>  <br>  With a sun still nearly always lacking a sunspot and oceans that may be cooling for decades, it's getting harder and harder to believe in warming, though we may soon wish it were so. If only we could delay an ice age with enough CO2. Alas, it's never happened in the past since CO2 levels were 10 times higher than they are now during an ice age, which is inconvenient for the alarmist line I think. Not enough oil exists to get us back to that level of CO2 concentration, yet the IPCC predicts up to 8C of warming by 2100, which in the past required 20 times the current level of CO2.<br>  <br>  Sea ice extent proves that predictions for an ice-free Arctic were unfounded, but I didn't notice any retractions by the media. We haven't had so much ice in the arctic since 1979 yet they continue to harp on warming as if it was occurring. All the CO2 we have now adds about 3C to the overall warming the Earth enjoys, yet a small increase in that level will add another 8C? Someone needs to fact-check the IPCC or put fresh batteries in their calculators.|`|1oxBCtmZaa	I believe that the AGW proponents will continue to respond with contradictory counterpoints.   Some will respond "weather not climate - the overall trend is still warming" and some will respond "global warming doesn't actually mean warming, just extreme temperatures, including extreme cold, so this actually proves it."    Nobody on Y/A appears to have attempted to pick up the "man-made global dimming masking man-made global warming ball" and run with it - and I take credit for heading that argument off at the pass by exposing it a year ago (you may remember Nancy).<br>  <br>  And before anyone accuses me of maintaining multiple accounts (I never have), "Nancy" was deleted after questions and answers were reported over a long weekend when I was away.   I'd like to point out that AGW skeptics don't engage in the "report the other side's best debaters" tactic.   Clearly some of the AGW proponents do.<br>  <br>  Under "Randall" I had six successive accounts, each reported and deleted in similar fashion.<br>  <br>  This account I've maintained for a few months now - granted I change the name every now and then but it's not meant to deceive: each name is that of a Chelsea FC player.      <br>  <br>  By the way isn't that great that Drogba scored so late in the game?

gaXUIduMaa	The link the other poster gave is good but some of the prices can be beat.  Costco has several energy efficient bulbs out so if you are a member or can find someone to take you, you might want to drop by.  Some local power companies are actually subsidizing the cost of the bulb or even offering free replacement of lamps (Southern California Edison did both of these).  Check your power company's website to see if they have something similar.  <br>  You mentioned a couple issues that many people forget.  Although the CFLs put out a "white" light, it does have a greenish hue that you will not notice unless someone takes a photograph without a flash.  Plus the light really isn't on all the time, it is on only when the electricity is on and since we use alternating current (AC), it actually blinks 60 times a second.  That tends to give some people headaches if exposed for long periods.  <br>  Now one thing you might want to look for.  It is less available and a bit more expensive but there is a newer bulb than the CFL lighting.

Reusing or recycling will do two things: no more oil or other fossil fuel is needed to make the product and none will be released when it is incinerated. If the discarded product is dumped in a landfill the release of CO2 will take far longer than if it's incinerated, in some cases it takes centuries to be released.<br>  <br>  Recycling doesn't just include plastic bags and soda cans, you can reuse items such as appliances by getting them fixed (or doing it yourself), and that seems to be getting rare today. If it's cheaper to buy a new microwave then nobody bothers to do anything to fix an older model which is incredibly wasteful and short-sighted but that's the society we live in.<br>  <br>  It often costs money to recycle things such as old computers and other equipment so few companies or cities will do this on their own without a financial incentive to make it profitable. Some cities that require items be separated into various recycling bins often just dump most of it together instead of recycling due to budget shortfalls, once the items are out of the public view. Until their are recycling fees collected at the point of sale and used only for recycling those items this problem will continue, and such a fee might make it more likely for some items to be repaired instead of replaced.|`|ChQWhMfWaa	When you don't recycle the rubbish gets put in landfills which produce methane, which helps global warming, however, when you recycle the paper just goes through its 'creation process' again and stays in use for longer!|`|zince8g1aa	Production of industrial products like plastics, paper, aluminum cans, etc. produces carbon emissions.

uFQFRdczaa	Hold on, Kilted Cowboy.  Rapeseed oil is Canola.  Soybean oil is sold as "vegetable oil."  They are totally different plants.<br>  <br>  Brazil has mandated that all its diesel should be 2% biofuel, which is projected to use about 1260 million liters--and is not all new soy--they also use castor oil, and can use waste vegetable oil as well.  <br>  <br>  Brazil is projected to grow 57 million metric tons of soya this year.  Soya oil weighs 927kg/m^3.  1m^3=1,000 liters, and since I don't feel like doing precise math today, I'm going to round 927kg up to 1,000, or one metric ton.  20% of the bean can be pressed into oil.  With my very rough rounding,  5 tons of beans will make 1,000 liters of oil.  So 6.3 million tons will be required.  That's about 11% of the projected crop.  However, when oil is pressed, the remaining 80% is soy meal, which is still food.  6.3 million tons of beans pressed for oil will leave about 5 million tons of soy meal.|`|ppvfrHo3aa	Overall, not that much.

Lfn2LOTzaa	What the weatherman and many ppl. fail to understand is the nature of "the "politics" of science" or how the scientific studies are conducted. (not politics in regard to government)<br>  If a scientist has no funding or grants for research for their theories, he is just a dude with some "ideas". If a particular theory is "unpopular" it will not receive much funds. But the main problem is MANY scientists simply will keep unpopular theories to themselves for the very realistic fear of losing respect and credibility in the scientific community. Not just with global warming, with ALL of science including physics especially. <br>  But the fact is it has always been the "outcast" who has ever made any REAL scientific breakthroughs. Scientists back in the day who believed the earth was NOT the center of the universe were ridiculed, discredited, and ignored. Why would a scientist who studied all his life in costly schools risk losing his career, credibility, and livelihood? Thankfully some, but not many, do. But until they can present an unpopular theory, without fear of being a discredited, wacky outcast, this is just how it is.<br>  <br>  So in many cases, scientific "consensus" passes for scientific "evidence", and many ppl. do not understand the intrinsic "politics of science". The Scientific community is kind of like a suburban high school clique in their exclusion of the "different". You would figure liberals would understand at least THAT!<br>  <br>  EDIT- Case in point.. Pegminer. I am not going to call him a liar and claim he is not a "real" scientist. He may well be. But the fact is there are many ppl who have masters in science or other degrees and present evidence AGAINST GW, but they are NOT referred to as "scientists". They are just unbelievers or dismissed entirely. But pegminer can still be a considered a respectable legitamate scientist just by his belief in glabal warming.

All researchers get their grant money from somewhere.

Once you're familiar with the scientific evidence, it becomes quite clear that they're correct.|`|AsKWImpQaa	I don't know who you're talking about when you say "someone doing independent research." Obviously someone is paying them, if not the government then private money. The Bush Administration would have loved to find climate scientists that thought that humans were not causing warming--but still almost all the evidence that was found points to AGW. Frankly, lots of scientists would LOVE to be studying something else, but AGW seems to be a very compelling problem.<br>  <br>  And it does seem like you are saying all scientists lie, when you say "they are no different from whores give them enough money and they will say anything."  I find that statement repugnant.  How did you become so anti-science? If I have a choose a group of people to trust, it would certainly be scientists over politicians of any variety.<br>  <br>  By the way, I am a climate scientist, I am not funded by the government, and I completely believe that AGW is real.|`|i5H1CNgOaa	I don't really understand your question. Not all scientists lie, but they can be wrong.|`|34BQRUMqaa	I'd love to see you name a single qualified scientist studying the climate that isn't funded by any government or an industry group with vested interests.  The truth of the matter is, that most basic research is either funded by governments or by business that stand to profit from the outcome.  <br>  <br>  Does that mean all science is tainted? No. It simply means that science needs to be scrutinized by other qualified scientists. Not because scientists are corrupt, so much as that they are humans and can make errors.  Fortunately, the world has a wonderful system of peer reviewed scientific journals and major scientific associates where the truth is weeded out from the errors.  Science, as a system, is moving ever closer to understanding things, included climate.<br>  <br>  As for your claim that Britain in the 70's was touting global cooling, I'd suggest that your memory isn't as good as you think.  You were probably a relatively young uneducated person at that time, and you merely heard a few speculative claims (probably in the popular press, not in any scientific journals). Most legitimate scientists in the 70's were already becoming concerned about global warming. Most, at that stage, acknowledged that they didn't yet know enough.  But in the 30 years since then, we now know enough.<br>  <br>  You refer to respected scientists work as "hack research". If you have the intelligence to identify mistakes in their published papers, then please do so. But calling them "hacks" and insulting "liberals" only demonstrates your own political bias. It does nothing to add any credibility to your disagreement with climate scientists..|`|fwnqB0dTaa	I don't know where you get your figures from but 97% of climatologists say we are affecting the climate, so to say a similar number oppose it is completely false.<br>  <br>  We have also contributed to a 35.6% rise in CO2 levels since the start of the Industrial Revolution, taken against the original CO2 level (the 0.01% value bandied around by deniers is, to use your words, "a bunch of crock")<br>  <br>  I also don't like the word "enthusiast", how can anyone be enthusiastic about something that may have such dire consequences a few generations in the future.<br>  <br>  Now to the crux of your question, credibility.<br>  <br>  Both independant, and government funded researchers are saying we are affecting the climate, so there is no credibility issue.<br>  <br>  As for government funding being the reason for doing it. That may be the case in the USA, but in the UK government wages are lower than independant researchers wages (I should know as I work for the UK Met Office the same as the researchers in the Hadley Centre, probably earn more than a lot of them, and am still way under average non-government wages) so the argument doesn't hold water.<br>  <br>  Outside the USA this issue is seen as scientific, and is treated as such, it is only within the USA that it is a political issue.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Having also lived throught the 70's in the UK, in fact having been here all my life, makes no difference. The "New Ice Age" alarmists (to use the deniers favourite description of anyone who says the climate is changing) have had their data largely discredited.|`|6Gfz125Paa	Seeing as the government (until very recently) was against the global warming theory, I would assume that federal grants would cause scientists to manipulate their data AGAINST global warming.  <br>  <br>  Also, the deniers are not doing "independent research".  Check where they get their funding.  A lot of it comes from the oil and auto companies.

Ir0dKh3iaa	Watch March of the Penguins - you'll get all your answers!!<br>  But I'll answer some....I know a little deal about Penguins!!! :D<br>  <br>  Most people believe penguins only live in cold weather but that isn't true. <br>  Many species of penguins live in Antarctica, others live in places like New Zealand. Penguins eat mostly fish that they catch by gliding in the water - it's beautiful. <br>  Global warming definitely effects penguins lives - mostly looking at those that live in the cold weather. They use their stomachs to glide on the snow to get around and if there is no snow then it will be hard for them to get around. global warming increases the temperature in the water, and if it gets too warm for fish they'll die - which is the main source of food for penguins. if there is no fish....they will have nothing to eat.|`|4e1nRQCUaa	Penguins live throughout the southern hemisphere.  Typically we think of those who live in Antarctica, the coldest continent. These penguins live on the brink of survival.  If the world were to get 5 degrees colder, the Emperor penguin would undoubtably cease to exist.  As it is, many of them die in the harsh cold of winter (June, July, August) every year.  Their trek from the edge of the ice to the land is about as far as they can travel.  If there was more ice, they would not be able to nest.  <br>  If, however, the earth was to warm up, then the penguins would be doing great!  Fewer would die each year, nesting would be easier, they would need less food to generate warmth and insulation for the winter, and the population would explode.  They are not even close to exhausting their food supply, antarctic fish. We could reasonably expect the population to double for every 5 degrees F the area warmed up.
0uvgAKSZaa	"Environmental scientists conduct research to identify, abate, and eliminate hazards that affect people, wildlife, and their environments. These workers analyze measurements or observations of air, food, water, and soil to determine the way to clean and preserve the environment. Understanding the issues involved in protecting the environment—degradation, conservation, recycling, and replenishment—is central to the work of environmental scientists. They often use this understanding to design and monitor waste disposal sites, preserve water supplies, and reclaim contaminated land and water to comply with Federal environmental regulations. They also write risk assessments, describing the likely affect of construction and other environmental changes; write technical proposals; and give presentations to managers and regulators."<br>  <br>  <br>  Im majoring in Environmental Biology right now(idk if its the same,prob similar) and I really do not like it at all.lol Wasn't meant for me, I have no interest in it at all.

aqeWwA71aa	Yes - storage is the big problem.  We can make energy a lot easier than we can store it or ship it.  <br>  <br>  One thing they do at some huge dams is to use the excess energy to pump water way up somewhere, and then they let it go at peak demand time to make more electricity.  I know of two major dams which do this.<br>  <br>  One really interesting idea for storage of energy is the flywheel.  We might be seeing these here shortly on trains.  The brakes of the train will be generators which make power - this will spin up a huge flywheel - and then power will be taken off the flywheel as the train starts back up again.<br>  <br>  This idea could be used anywhere when there's some excess power which would otherwise go to waste.  The drawback is that if the bearings of the flywheel came unglued, the energy released would kill everybody within a block.  So the bearings better not fail.<br>  <br>  Energy can be stored chemically by getting solar energy - making electricity - using that to strip hydrogen off of water molecules and shipping the hydrogen through existing gas lines to burn in furnaces.<br>  <br>  The burning of hydrogen releases only CO2 and water vapor.<br>  <br>  It's going to be fun with Obama's Stimulus money to see the new ideas which show up.  We're going to need them after wasting the last 8 long years on republicans and their oil habit.
