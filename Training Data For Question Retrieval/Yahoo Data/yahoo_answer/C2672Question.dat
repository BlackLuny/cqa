20090203100536AAUpaDj	Pets;Dogs	BSL or raw feeding?                            ?	I am doing a speech in my college class and I know these two subjects very well.    Well now I need to decide which one I will just introduce people to(central idea) and which one I will convince people is wrong or right(persuasive).      For the persuasive, I am leaning towards BSL because I need to convince people to not support it. Problem is people in my class have no idea what bsl is so jumping to fighting it might be pointless.      Raw feeding people seem to know a little about based on responses, but I dont think there are dire consequences for not feeding raw unless you consider peridontal diseaese dire.       So for my question: Which idea should I do for my central idea and which one should I do for the persuasive speech?       And if anyone has any Anti Breed Specific Legislation links, I would highly appreciate it.

20090203101244AAZ0t5j	Pets;Dogs	My 13 year old dog now has kidney failure. She also suffers from congestive heart failure and mammary tumors.?	Her CHV has been maintained stable for the past 1.5 years taking enalapril, lasix and pimobendan. Her mammary tumors would grow only when in heat. She just recently got operated from Pyometra successfully the only setback was a blood transfusion afterwards. Now her BUN is not where it should be so they want to put her on fluids and another medication. She also takes dismutase and metacam. I'm concerned on the amount of meds she's already on and if thats the reason her kidneys are failing??? She's a very happy dog and eats very well. Honestly looking at her and the risks she has run into a feel like she's a walking miracle. Her strentgh is incredible! I want the best for her...any suggestions???

20090219182611AABJmSA	Pets;Cats	Putting my cat to sleep..?	My cat of 15 years has feline infectious perifontinus. At first we were giving her cortizone shots and she turned back to my beautiful loving cat. But she's no longer responding to the shots. She hasn't eaten in a couple days and she's getting kind of skinny. She's really just not the same cat anymore...      I KNOW it's cruel to keep her alive, I'm just having a really hard time letting go. It's one thing to find your cat dead, but it's another thing to take her somewhere KNOWING that these are her last moments. It's heartbreaking to even think about.      I'm not really sure what my question is... I guess i just need some help. Advice, kind words, stories relating to my problems... Anything really =[

20090219181625AAi9c6E	Pets;Dogs	Is my dog badly hurt? What can I do?	I have this "friend" who dropped my chihuahua. She fell about 4 or 5 feet and landed on her legs. She seemed fine, but today when I was walking her, she held up one of her back legs. After she runs or over-uses it in the house, she holds it up again. There is no splinter or anything. She can still run and jump (and she tries it), so I know it's not broken, and she lets me touch it and the paw with no problem. Is it just a bruise or a sprain? Is it a joint issue?      I have no money for the vet. At least not for a few weeks. And when I say no money, I mean it. I have 20 bucks for the rest of the month. I'm not eating.      What can I do here and now?

I have had 2 Grey Tree frogs, after I had to put my first 1 down I swore I wouldn't get another but they are such awesome frogs that I did. The problem with the one that died is that he lost his back legs, he just couldn't use them one day, he lived awhile after that but he was absolutely miserable so we had to put him down. I came home this afternoon to also find my current grey tree frog losing his back legs, they aren't completely gone yet but they are going at a very fast rate. He has a huge cage with good temperatures, humidity, soil and everything. Why is this happening and is there anything I can do?
20090219181451AAQMiUA	Pets;Horses	How Can I Follow My Horse Over Jumps?	I have been jumping for about 2 years now, and I haven't had any trouble staying with the horse over jumps in the past. I have jumped consistently up to 3'3 on other horses, and actually wanted to go higher! However, last year I purchased my four year old hanoverian mare, Rhaigan, who has an absolutely HUGE jump. I have never ridden a horse with so much power and athleticism. Since Rhaigan jumps so hard, I find it impossible to stay with her over jumps. I always end up jumping ahead or getting left behind. I have a pretty solid position, and I have actually won equitation classes, but I just can't get it right with Rhaigan. Are there any techniques that could help me follow a horse with a monster jump?

20090219183141AA83BA5	Pets;Reptiles	Leopard Gecko (again)?	I wrote a few hours ago, but things have changed.      First off, I think she is impacted. She is so skinny because she hasnt eaten. The last time she ate was like a few days ago, like two crickets. But for a while now she hasnt eaten much. So I switched her bedding from Calci-Sand to paper towels. I got wax worms and she wont touch em. She is probably still freaked about me having to take her out to give her a warm bath ( they said that could help impaction if thats what she has). Her little belly was cold so I put her heater on the bottom. She was acting so weird when I put her back in her cage. She was climbing everywhere and went behind her tree in the corner and just sat there. Which that is her favorite place to poo but she didnt. Please tell me whats going on? She is my lil baby and I am really scared.

20090219185716AAQqLkq	Pets;Dogs	I have a 13 month old siberian husky that had puppies a little over 13 wks. ago.?	Over the last 2-3wks she has really lost a lot of weight. One of her puppies was run over by a car and i think she may have seen it happen. She has little appetite and her personality has changed alot. she is even becoming aggressive towards her other puppy. I wormed her last week and will worm her again in a week or so. She only weighs 38 pounds and I am concerned. She is also losing lots of her winter coat. It is falling out in big clumps. Should I be concerned or is this natural? Any information would be appreciated.   27 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.       Additional Details   And for MrsCullen1, I did not allow my puppy to be run over. He was not in the road. He was run over in the woods behind my house by someone when I was blowing leaves and doing yard work. You can't even imagine the torment i experienced after searching for hours in the dark and pouring down rain and finding my puppy was dead. I have 4 dogs outside and 1 inside and I assure you I love my dogs and take very good care of them. Hope you never have to experience what i did that day.   5 minutes ago

But I took in one of them last year because he came up to my door ate up by fleas and malnourished. Anyways, he would go in and out as he pleased, and always came back..he knew our cars and apartment well. We moved a month ago, and we are trying to make him a housecat. He whines and begs to go out, but I am scared to let him out due to the fact that this is a new neighborhood and he might get lost, or taken by someone. Anyways, he has starting peeing on bags..he has peed on my kids backpacks, my husbands gym bag, lots of shopping bags..nowhere else, just on bags. Plastic, cotton, it don't matter what material. I want to let him out to explore thinking it might be end result of him being confined to the house, but I am just not so sure it would be wise. If he didn't come back my 9 year old would be heartbroken. My husband wants to get him fixed, he thinks it may fix the issue. I'm not sure it will. Anyone got any ideas on what to do in this situation?

I have a three month old burm and everything is set up right according to what i have read about. i have a nice substrate made of organic dirt or something, cant remember but not cypres. the owner at the pet shop said is was perfect; a under tank heater and a ceramic heater. i change it out for a uv heating light during the day for photoperiods. i have two hides...one on the cold and one on the hot. i put her water bowl inbetween the two. the temps range from 73 to 83 in the cold and 85 to 92 in the basking area. Is this good enough for her???    i also noticed that at night she is all over the place in the vivarium and always climing to the top of the cage acting like she wants out; is this a sign she does not like it in there? and during the day, she sits on the cold side wound up next to the glass. have yet to see her sitting in the basking area. note that i just put the second hide in tonight so im not sure if she will use it yet...

Also she said I need to have a grand in the bank for their frequent cuts they almost always need suturing, special anesthesia. Do you have to suture your Greyhound often like this?

When I got him, I was told that he was 18 months, and when I took him to the vet, I was then told that he is closer to 3-5 years, and also imbread back down the line.. something with his grandma...       I fell in love with my boomer, he is so sweet. I asked a question before about him, because he is hard to train.. I was told by a dog trainer that its the imbreeding.       Now my problem is he doesn't quite understand his toys. Isn't sure what to do with them.. He would will run and play keep away from me and my boyfriends kitty. And he will play with our clothes, anything he can find. Sometimes he will run in the bedroom and come out dragging a shirt thats twice his size. He couldnt care less about a ball, chew toy, rope toy, or anything.... just clothes.       I tried smaller balls to fit his mouth better, but he just doesn't care.   How do I get him to want to play with his toys, not chew my clothes...

20090219193909AAx9Nr1	Pets;Dogs	It seems my 8 month old boxer dog is not gaining weight?	I have an 8 month old boxer dog, but he's not gained weight in the last month.  He weighs 53.8 lbs.  I feed him 4 cups a day (2 in the morning, and 2 at night) of Natural Choice Small Bites Puppy and mix it with the nutro max wet food as well.  I exercise him everyday, at least 3 mile walk at a time at least once a day, and we go to the dog park.  Sometimes there are owners who would let their dogs play with mine, so he does get lots of exercise.  His coat is beautiful and shiny.  when I go to the dog park though, he seems very small.  I can see his briefcage bones still, he does have a litte bit of muscle on chest and back legs.  My husband and I are just worried that he's not gaining any weight lately.        He is up to date on shots, and has been treated for worms when he was little, and takes heartguard monthly.  I started to wonder if he got maybe worms at the dog park.  I wonder if I'm just panicing for no reason, so wanted opinions before taking him to the vet to make sure all is fine.  A couple of friends said, that's how the boxer should look like, but other puppies his age are bigger.  I adopted him from a rescue at 12 weeks old, and he was the smaller one of the two boxers.   thanks for any opinion you have!

20090219200349AAH0NtM	Pets;Other - Pets	Random questions about pet rabbits.. such as habitat and diet. 5 points for the best answer!!?	I would say that my dwarf rabbit 6 or 7 years old.. maybe even 8. I need to go through my my scrap books and double check his age! Either way.. let's face it.. he's getting old!      During the daytime, I open up his cage and close off the foyer with two baby gates. I would say the foyer is about 12ftx10ft.. I'm not quite sure. It's a tiled floor.. is this okay for the little guy too run around in? will his paws get cold? His cage floor is wire, and there's a slot underneath for the pan with the bedding.. so I know the wire must be tough on his feet! Today I just put a big cardboard box in the foyer with some newspaper on the bottom, a some wood shavings and lots of alfalfa for him to relax and dig and play in. Maybe it will even keep him warm? Is it ok to put newspaper in his playing area? Will the ink on the paper be harmful to him? I tried to get a piece with little colored ink just in case. Also, I put some newspaper in my gerbils cage too for him to shred and play in. I know this question is about rabbits... but hey if it's harmful for rabbits it's probably harmful for gerbils too.       Pumpkin is also very picky of what treats he likes. The only treats that I give him that he actually eats are raisins and pears. He LOVES raisins. But hates carrots... a rabbit that hates carrots... wtf? hahahhaa. I feed him Animal Planet Fortified Rabbit pellet-food. I give him a few raisins probably every day... is he receiving proper nutrition?      I know you must be thinking "oh, what a great time to ask these basic questions 6-8 years after she's had the rabbit" but they were just questions that all of a sudden came to mind. He's not overweight, has a nice, thick, soft fur coat and is most likely healthy because he's pretty old. I've only taken him to the vet once... A few years back he hadn't been eating for about 2-3 days and wasn't pooping or even peeing. Food and water were readily available.      Also, is it neccessary to bathe rabbits on a timely basis? I've only given him baths probably about 2 or 3 times in his life because he got into some messes and was filthy.                Sorry this was so long and I kept expanding... but thanks to anyone who read this and can help! You will be rewarded!

20090219191821AAAa1T8	Pets;Dogs	How to I stop my dog from torturing my cat?	Ok so I have a year old pitbull and two kitties who are going on three. One of my cats hides all day and waits till we go to sleep and he comes out and sleeps in my hair which is sad, but he has always been a naturally timid boy, so with the dog around it just makes him worse. Now my other cat Zakk is very playful and outgoing and quite the character. At first he would hide from the dog, but now he just dont give a ****. He will let her sniff him for a minute or so and then he starts to get pissed and gives her a few whacks. My cat likes to hang out on the end of the bed and my dog will come up on the bed and harrass him to no end. I mean, shes realy not doing anything bad, she just like basically cleans his fur with her teeth you know, like she would do with a puppy, but then she will start to get all playful and start jerking her body back and forth and you know cats dont like this fast clumsy motions that dogs do when they play. So I yell at the dog and tell her no. I have even smacked her a few times. I have tried getting inbetwen them and petting them at the same time and tell the dog easy girl and give them both poistive reinforcment when they are being calm together. But she just starts getting excited again and starts to act like a raging lunatic. I have also tried the ceaser millan trick with the neck jab thing, that doesnt work AT ALL! I have tried giving her treats when she behaves calmly with him. I even tried refusing to let her get up on the bed and backing her up by standing in front of her and not letting her move you know to claim the space. I feel like I have tried EVERYTHING and NOTHING works!! She doesnt respond to any kind of discipline! I mean its getting bad I feel like I am dealing with a couple of two year olds!! I am not going to just point  the finger at the dog because I know Zakk does instigate some of this, but I just DONT KNOW what to do anymore! She is making me so mad I jsut want to whack her!  Its not that they are scared of eachother, its just the dog doesnt know when to quit. The other day i witnessed the cat scratch her eye, and his claw got stuck on her face. not to met the multiple times he has given her a bloody nose... and the dog doesnt even react!! She just goes right back like nothing ever happened! So it is  getting kind of dangerous So anyone have an ideas?? I am not down for seperating them cuz I want them both to have their freedom throughout the day you know? What is a good way to train the dog to leave the cat alone, or at least get her to play gently? Thanx in advance! Please help me and my kitty! He needs to be able to roam freely without getting ambushed by my psycho puppy

I want to get a dog over the summer, so then I have at least a good month of being home 24/7 with the dog. I can properly introduce them and keep them separated for awhile and let them come on their own terms. Not to mention I plan on either crating my dog or putting up a baby gate (a tall one) in front of the kitchen while I'm gone so they aren't ever alone.       How do I convince them it can work?

20090219191603AAW1wf8	Pets;Cats	How to make my cats love people?	My cat is currentley 2 1/2 years old. She was born on the streets and we rescued her when she was a newborn. She was very close to dying but my family and I saved her. She is a very shy cat now and always has been. I think its because she was born on the streets and didn't see very many people but Im not for sure. She loves my other cat and they cuddle together a lot and she'll stay with you if shes already there and you come. And when she does stay, shes very sweet and cuddles and rubs up against you. But when you try to hold her, she'll always run away and we have a huge screened in backyard with a kitty door to get out there and shes out there 24/7. I really want her to like people more and not be so afraid. She loves my family because shes used to us, but with new people and things, she is just so terrified. Example, one time my mother was pressure washering and she got so scared, she hid in the gutter outside!

20090219182029AAYyhpo	Pets;Dogs	My roommate is really mean to my dog?	My dog is really terrified of my roommate. She has dropped her from a high space, smacks her on the top of the head to tease and punched her. I don't want to be a douche, because most of the time it's just small antagonizations, but now it's really starting to bug me. She doesn't take confrontation well/avoids it, and we don't get along perfectly to begin with. What can I say that doesn't sound condemning. I feel bad for my dog. I think her leg is bruised from the last teasing.

I have a torishell cat who is a sort of mottled black and ginger with  white underneath, she also has a white bib and four white socks.   She has one ginger front leg and the other is the mottled colour.   She is quite a moody girl, so i was hoping for a name to suit her personality.   The only one's we have thought of are 'Marble' and 'Checkers', but these only account for her colouring.   What do you all think ?

I have had a SBT since December, she is great in the crate (just one accident, LAST NIGHT) but here is the problem.....she goes outside, pees and poops, I then bring her inside and anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes later she poops and pees AGAIN.      I have a second dog, APBT that is 22 mo old and when they both rough house she must pee two or three times in the process while playing.  I don't know what else to do (BTW she is very healthy).  Could it be she needs some more exercise?       Just when I think she is completely done, she comes back in and poops AGAIN and some additional pee pee comes out!!!      Oh BTW they play lots together, so I don't think its lack of exercise.

20090219183233AAoHAdK	Pets;Dogs	Is my Doberman fully grown?	Hello everyone,       I'm new to this thing.  I have a Doberman who is roughly a year and a half old, she weighs 55 lbs.  I understand that she is full grown height wise, but will she gain anymore weight?  She is the smallest dobe I have ever seen.  She is very proportionate, prob perfect, but I was hoping she may get a little bigger.  Is she full grown, will she gain more weight.  I hope she does because one of the many reasons I picked the Doberman breed was that they can be very intimidating (she's really a "happy go lucky dog") but looks are not intimidating at all due to her size.  Thanks for all your answers in advance.

Seriously now, I read A lot of traumatic stories on Yahoo Answers, and A lot of people that have no time on their hands to post a real answer. They post an answer on the pets section like "take it to the vet!" NO that's not right what if its something minor, I don't know, maybe just like a flew or something. Why don't you actually be helpful and not say anything or at least back up your answer. Its basically spamming and im sure the person that's asking the question doesn't like it.

20090219190144AA72nwd	Pets;Fish	Table Salt In Freshwater Aquarium?	me and my friend got in a fight and he threatened to put table salt into my freshwater aquarium, i attempted to restrain him from grabbing the table salt from my desk near the aquarium but he got his hands on it and i have two tanks on a stand one above the other, so anyway he grabbed the salt shaker and threw it at the top of my tank on the top shelf of the stand witch has a 1 inch space at the back of the lid, the shaker hit the back edge of the tank and then hit the wall and landed RIGHT BEHIND the tank on the bottom shelf that has NO LID im not sure though if any salt got in the tank and if it did it only would of been a very TINY sprinkle into the tank, i was wondering if this would have a chance of harming my fish, the top tank contains a blue dragon goby, mollies, pink kissing gourami's, iridescent sharks, balla sharks, a serpae tetra, some neon tetra's and a few sucker fish i dont know the name of. (this tank has been set up for a good 6 months) and the bottom tank contains goldfish (feeder fish for my oscar's) i dont really care about the goldfish but im worried about all the tropical tank, so i would like your opinions on if even a LITTLE TINY sprinkle of table salt got into the tank would it harm any of my tropical tank.      Also please note that it was only over the gap on the tank for the blink of an eye so it would of only been an extremely small amount of salt.      Please Post Your Opinions.

She has never once pooped outside the box, but I don't know if she has ever has peed in it.  She tends to hide when she pees on the carpet.  We think she knows she's not allowed so she hides.  We've tried moving her litter box to her pee spot, but then I even caught her peeing right beside the box.  A brand new box with brand new litter!!  She has more than one box too.  We spray and clean the carpet in hopes of getting the smell out so she doesn't smell it.  We don't know what else to do!!! I don't want to get rid of her, but we can't have a cat peeing on the carpets.  Also, she's getting spayed in 2 weeks.  Do you think that will help solve any of this?  Any ideas at all as to what we can do would be greeeaaat!! Thanks!!

20090219193125AAhwpqA	Pets;Dogs	My vet thinks my Labrador has a liver shunt what is this and is it easily treated?	I have talked to the vet, and done tons of research online but still don't feel like i know enough. She does not show any of the signs that they say a dog will show with a shunt but in a recent ultra sound done they said the liver looked small. She had been in to the vet with a case of giardia and they said the small liver could be due to dehydration that often accompanies giardia. But even after an iv was administered to hydrate her the liver still looked small. She is a three year old black lab and liver shunts usually begin showing signs when they are young but as i said she still does not show any. She always is begging for food and is completely aware of everything. The vet is going to do a full liver exam to be able to tell but I am just looking for any other explanations for her small liver. If anyone has any information that has to do with liver shunts and whether or not they are harmful to the dog i would appreciate you sharing. I love my dog and am looking for any way to keep her as healthy as possible. Please share any information about liver shunts or any other condition that would account for her small liver. The vet said this could just be normal for her, but i am very cautious when it comes to my baby and want to make sure everything is ok! thank you so much!

I have been massaging his neck and trying comfort him but I don't know what to do.      Have any of you every dealt with this with your dog and if so, what was it and what did you do?!?!
20090219195332AAh67Rv	Pets;Dogs	Aussie lovers! Is the stray that I found actually an Aussie?	I picked up a stray with a worn-out collar, no tags, on the side of the road two years ago because she was almost dead, and I didn't want her to have to die on the side of the road. Took her to the vet and it turned out that the only thing wrong with her is that she was starving and had mange, so I ended up with a dog.       I had just assumed she was a Heinz 57 because I found her in Nowheresville, Tennessee, in a very rural area. So I posted on YA, just for fun, what breeds people thought she had in her, and the answers that got all the votes were Australian Shepherd answers.      Having no idea what Aussies looked like, I googled images, and while the coloring of most of them was completely different, I came upon these. These look exactly like my dog; I mean, this dog could be her twin:       http://www.starstruckshepherds.com/Mini%...        http://www.starstruckshepherds.com/Mini%...       Here is my dog. By the way, her hair crimps when it is damp, and she's super-soft:       http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v705/a...        http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v705/a...        http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v705/a...       Now, the pictures are from a BYB or something in Canada, who breeds "miniature" Australian Shepherds. I know that Aussies come in one size and the mini stuff is a bunch of crap, but... Are "mini" Aussies just runt Aussies bred together to produce smaller dogs (e.g. "teacups"), or are Aussies bred with another breed of dog to make smaller mixes that look like Aussies (e.g. "miniature Dalmatians), or are they really not Aussies AT ALL but just a cross that looks like an Aussie (e.g. Miniature Pinschers)?       She weighs 50 pounds so the "miniature" part is questionable, but I'd like to know if she is ACTUALLY Australian shepherd because... she's kind of a weird dog, and if she IS an Aussie (or mostly a single breed), I'd like to read up on the breed so that I can better provide for her needs. For the most part I have only had hunting dogs for my entire life, and I've NEVER had a herding breed.       So please no mean answers... She's not worth any more or less if she's an Aussie versus a Heinz 57, and I would certainly never tell people I had a "miniature Australian Shepherd." I just want to care for my dog in the best way possible, and I'm wondering if some of her weirdness is a herding instinct that she can't express properly.

I thought she was over weight with all her fur and pot belly. Now that I am aware I will fix that problem, but I do not know how to help her lose her pot belly. I asked what I could do to help her and the vet said not to be to concerned about it, but I am. I do not want extra weight on her spine. We go for one mile walks right now 2-4 times a week. Mainly to help her get used to different situations. She does not do a lot of running around in the field and I do not know how to help her lose her pot belly. I know she is to young for lunging. Any ideas on what might help?? Thank you.

20090203102310AAgL1lD	Pets;Dogs	Due to human error my male cat got our neighbors cat preganant ?	he was due to be neutered but she came into heat before and due to a lack of supervision on our parts, she got pregnant (he is now neutered). I offered to pay for the neighbors to spay the cat and abort the kittens as she is only 10months old, but they refused. She is due any day and we are being given half the kittens. The cat will be spayed (I will pay for it myself if they can't find the money)       I don't want the kittens to suffer and end up contributing to the overpopulation and will therefore find appropriate homes for each and everyone (including home checks and vet referces)       I will unfortunately have to advertise online and was wondering whether this would work;       "A deposit of ï¿¡90 is required and will be fully paid back once kittens have been Spayed/neutered. PROOF will be required. "       Will people do it or will they rather part with the money. If it might not work, any other way to make sure the kittens are all S/N?       ________________________   Please don't be telling me what an idiot I was, I know and I am trying my best to fix it. The neighbors refuse to give me all the kittens, which is unfortunate. ALL the money from the sales will go to the local shelter, to make up for my stupid miskate.       Thank you all.

20090219194545AA2yuQq	Pets;Cats	Cat allergy question?	I might get a cat soon, and I already know that my entire direct family is not allergic to cats. However, my cousin is allergic to cats. If she were to of stayed over for a few days, how much would the cat affect her? Are there ways to reduce the reaction or even terminate it? Possibly a treatment to do to the cat every few days, like brushing it? We would only get a shorthair, just because we dont want alot of cat hair all around the house. THANKS SO MUCH 4 HELP!!!

When I first got her she exhibited signs of separation anxiety which over time dissipated without me really doing anything other than keeping a schedule.  We just moved into a new apartment a week ago and her separation anxiety has come back and it seems worse than ever!  She has already dug a huge hole out of the door from frantic scratching and when I return home she can barely breathe and is freaking out.  Does anyone have any good tips on dealing with this?  It's very frustrating because obviously there are times she is going to have to be alone.  Thanks!

We have tried barking collars, barking mussels and are now out of ideas.

My upper body is usually flat and relaxed, looking ahead, and giving sufficient rein. BUT my leg is horrendous. With a capitol H.    I have tried everything to fix my leg.. because I want to be textbook perfect so bad. I've tried riding without stirrups for months, reading every possible George Morris book, and many other futile things to maybe help me. But nothing is working.   I think I over-do jumping. My heel is usually always down, but my leg slips horribly! I don't get it. My trainer tells me that my horse is a hard ride -- and he is -- but still. I want to fix this! It has gotten so bad that sometimes when we go over a jump, my horse ends up taking off after it because I accidently get him way too far back on his stomach because of my leg.    PLEASE help!

20090203102527AAvqiTt	Pets;Dogs	My dog has a constant staph infection in his nose...?	About 2 1/2 years ago I noticed a little booger forming around my dog's left nostril.  It kept coming back, so I took him to the vet.  Every time he was given Cephalexin (antibiotics) and it would go away for a bit, but then always came back.  He was referred to a different vet for a rhinoscopy.  The vet removed the part of the nose that the booger formed on, and had it tested.  It turned out to be a bacterial staph infection (not MRSA).  It wasn't actually a spot at all, but mucus coming down through the nose and settling at the end.  So, he lost a piece of his nose for nothing.  Anyway, I decided I didn't want my dog to live his life on antibiotics, and he doesn't seem to even know there's something wrong with him (no mood or behavior change what so ever with this), so I've just been putting the occasional bit of triple antibiotic ointment (vet recommended) and pulling whatever boogers form on his nose.  Is my poor guy going to be dealing with this forever?  Will this affect his quality of life at all?  Just want to know if anyone out there has seen or heard of anything like this?  I know our vets had never seen it before...

Not, OH MY GOSH YOU NEED TO TAKE YOUR DOG TO THE VET RIGHT NOW hysteria.  I already have a vet appointment regarding this problem and am just looking for insight before I go in tomorrow morning.      So I got home from work last night at 5pm and my dog (a 15 month old dachshund/poodle/possibly terrier mix) was acting completely normal (barking at neighbor's noises, playing with toys, etc) but he came in the kitchen where I was around 6pm and sat down and I noticed he was wobbly and his back legs were acting funny.  I made him walk to the living room to show my boyfriend and he was walking all crazy like he had no control of his back legs and they were slipping all around and his rear end was swaying dramatically from side to side.  Then when he stood still his head was bobbling and his body was mildly shaking.  It only lasted about 3 minutes and he definitely had awareness since he turned his head when I called his name and followed me to the living room when I asked.  And ever since heâ€™s acting totally fine and normal.  Does anyone have any clue what might have happened?       Thanks for any help!

I have a female rabbit who is only 7 months old. How necessary is it to get her spayed? How much does that cost? Does it really help with their bathroom habits? (We let her out of her cage to run around in the kitchen for exercise.) She used to be somewhat potty-trained, and whenever she did pee out of her potty, it was a puddle in a corner (her potty is in another corner), but the past few weeks she has been splattering pee all over the place! Maybe it's a hormonal thing? What should I do? Any help would be fantastic. Thanks in advance!!!!!

So i just got a betta fish today.(male,dark red)   and he is in this little bowl(i heard that they like small spaces)   i'm going to petco tomorrow and i might get another betta.   i might get another male(i know i have to keep them separate)   but if i got a female i might put them in the same bowl.   if i put them in the same bowl do you think they would necessarily breed?   do you know what color bettas are most common?   least common?   easiest to find at petco or petsmart?   i also have a question about the food.   i have Betta Bio-Gold fish food.    i gave my betta 4 pellets.   i was wondering if they eat slowly or if you think he's just not hungry? (lol)   but also he seems very shy.    and my mom's friends gave him to me.    they bought him today though.   but like they said they would like recognize the owner and caretaker.   so i was wondering if your betta does this, and if it does how long did it take for that to happen?      thanks everyone !

20090219203954AAyO9bE	Pets;Cats	Petsmart Authority Brand Cat Food?	About a year or so ago I switched to Authority (sorry but it's the best I can afford with three cats and four people in the home).  One of my cats had hairballs so I got the hairball treatment.  Well it seemed like his hairballs got worse.  So I switched to sensitive formula.  When I went to purchase a bag of sensitive formula the other day they were out so I got the hairball formula.  Well they didn't like it very much and I swear two of my cats were coughing up hairballs all the time with that hairball formula, so I switched back to sensitive forumla.  I am almost done with the bag, but they don't seem to be liking it.  In fact sometimes I will leave the conainer accidentally in the garage and the racoons get in it, but with this bag they don't seem to want it. Anyway, next to the food bowl is a huge pile of vomit like one of them ate the whole bowl and threw it up.  So what should I do????  I have to stick with Authority, I feel like it's better than grocery store no byproducts, please do not criticize.  Also, several times a week I give the canned food.  With three cats I can't afford canned food all the time.  Other than that they seem to be fine, other than sleeping alot, which I believe is normal.

I just recently learned that adopted greyhounds have difficulty maneuvering stairs as they have probably never seen them before and must be taught how to go up and down stairs properly (for fear of injuring themselves). This may be a silly question but, due to their high-speed nature, as puppies grow older do they too need to learn how to properly walk up and down stairs? In case they might decide that the stairs are too frightening for them and might jump instead of walk?

20090219204750AAXZFR8	Pets;Rodents	My rat is dying, should I get a new rat to keep my 2nd rat company?	Sorry if the question is confusing, I didnt know how to phrase it.      My rat Lily has a large tumor. The vet cant do anything for her other than have us wait til she is in too much pain and put her down. She's 2 years older than my other rat, Fern. Fern has never been without Lily and I worry that Fern will make herself sick from depression when Lily goes.   Fern knows Lily is sick and doesn't leave her side, eats less than she used to and doesn't do any of the things she used to think were fun (play with me or my dogs or in run in her wheel)      What do you think would be better, get a new rat now and let Lily, Fern and the new rat bond (there is plenty of room in the cage) and hope it helps Fern through it; wait til Lily passes to get a new rat; or just let Fern be a lone rat for a while and shower her with affection after Lily goes and hope she gets through it?      My last pair of rats, after one passed the other got very sick very fast. he was older and I think he was hanging on for his brother and just gave up once he passed. Fern isnt old, but Im quite worried about a similar thing happening.   Any advice? I just dont know what to do.
