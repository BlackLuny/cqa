NOx is formed by reaction of nitrogen and oxygen in the air so is pretty much unavoidable. It can be reduced by decreasing the time that combustion occurs for and this is why aeroplane jet engines have become shorter in length over the years - a shorter combustion path through the engine will produce less NOx.    2.

1Wc2cnifaa	I'm not 100% sure about this but anyway here goes    Bacteria can form colonies called biofilms, which is basically like a slime layer in which different types of bacteria (or even just the single species) will form 'coral-like' structures which confers them strong resistance to environment/antibiotics/immunity because the structure prevents them from being killed.    To form a biofilm, bacteria 'talk' to each other, and when a consensus (quorum) has been achieved, signals will be secreted and they will start the formation of a biofilm.    This is one of the reasons why quorum sensing is important in determining bacterial competence.  Quorum sensing is where bacteria sense signals from each other..and this helps the bacteria undergo conjugation/transformation etc etc, and as such when the correct signals are received, the bacteria can become competent

Your question said that an employee who produces x units per HOUR earns an HOURLY wage of y = 0.35x + 11 (in dollars).    The rule says that WE CAN ONLY WORK ON TWO VARIABLES EQUATIONS IF WE HAVE TWO EQUATIONS AS WELL.    E.g.  a + 2b = 6  b = 2a    We can subsitute b with 2a, so:  a + 2a = 6  3a = 6  a = 2    Other ways are to use reduction, graphing, or elimination ways.    Thus, it means that your answer can't be answered.    So, from your question I can conclude that the hour is ONE because we can't solve the problem. Beside, you say that an employee produces x units per hour... and he earns an hourly wage of y = 0.35x + 11 dollars. This means that he works for an hour.

GhHJ68gcaa	Lots of questions here... I'll do my best to help you out with as much explanation as I can. Congrats on being back in school!     ------------  Q1. How do you set point (3,1) with a slope of 4/3 into  y = ? in-order to graph it?    The best part of all of this... you don't need the equation to graph it! Yeah! Start with the point (3, 1) on a coordinate plane... put a big dot.     The slope of 4/3... use the "rise over run" concept. From the point (3,1), go up 4 units and over (right) 3 units... put a big dot... you should be at the point (6, 5).     On the otherside, you can do just the opposite from the point (3, 1): go down 4 units and back (left) 3 units... you should be at the point (0, -3) on the y-axis.     Do it again... you should be at the point (-3, -7).     Connect the dots... you've used the graphical interpretation of slope to help you graph this line "RISE OVER RUN IS HOW IT'S DONE" :-)     However, if you had to have the equation... y = mx + b works fine. You know y = 1, m = 4/3 and x = 4. Now all you need is b... Plug these in and solve for b.   y = mx + b   1 = 4/3*3 + b  1 = 4 + b [Subtract by 4 on each side]   -3 = b     Put this back into your equation, this time only replacing the m and b, so you'll have the linear equation   y = mx + b  y = 4/3x + -3   y = 4/3x - 3     To graph it from this equation, identify your slope, m = 4/3 and the y-intercept b = -3.     Begin with b on the y-axis (move to -3 on the y-axis and put a big dot).     Move with m = 4/3 from that point using rise over run (rise 4, run 3)... from -3 on the y-axis move up 4 units and over (right) 3 units... put a big dot... you should be at the point (3, 1)...     Do it again... put a big dot... you should be at the point (6, 5)... [Hey... didn't we get these same dots earlier?!?]     You can go the other direction as well, by doing just the opposite... start at -3 on the y-axis still and move down 4 units and back (left) 3 units... put a big dot... you should be at (-3, -7)... [Hey, I've seen that point before!?!]... connect your dots and you've got a lovely straight line that goes up from left to right!    Using the y = mx + b method, I tell my students BBBBegin with bbbb and MMMMove with mmmm.     ------------  Q2. How do I express 2x - 8y = -4 in slope-intercept form?    Slope-intercept form is a way of writing a linear equation so that it's really easy to graph, usually. Slope intercept is the form y = mx + b.     Notice that the y is by itself on the left hand side and everything else is on the right hand side and simplified.     It's called slope-intercept form because the coefficient of the x-term, m, is the slope (if you graphed this line)    The stuff that remains is, b, is y-intercept of the graph.     For your particular problem:  2x - 8y = -4 [move the 2x by subtracting 2x from each side]  -8y = -2x - 4 [divide by -8 on each side]  y = -2/-8x - 4/-8 [simplify the fractions]  y = 1/4x + 1/2    The slope is m = 1/4 and the y-intercept is b = 1/2. Actually, this is not the easiest thing to graph from this form. :-(    ------------  Q3. How do I put (2,3) and (14,-6) into an equation?    Most people will find m and then use point-slope form. (There are at least three other methods.)  This is y - y[1] = m (x - x[1])... The [...] thingies mean that what ever is inside is written as a subscript (lower and smaller to the left, like where the commas are in this parenthetical notation, only smaller).    So you need m, x[1] and y[1].     The slope, m, is how we move on a graph, but when all you've got is two points, you can use   m = ( y[2] - y[1] ) / (x[2] - x[1] ) = ?y / ?x  ... the difference of the y-values divided by the difference of the x-values. The ? symbol is the Greek capital letter Delta and means 'change'. Mathematicians use this a lot and it means to subtract values.    The difference of the y-values... subtract the y-values in each coordinate pair: -6 - 3 = -9.     The difference of the x-values... subtact the x-values in each coordinate pair: 14 - 2 = 12.     Write this as a ratio and simplify: -9/12 = -3/4. This is the slope, the m.     y[1] is the y-value of a coordinate pair (typically the first coordinate, but it really doesn't matter).  We'll use the coordinate pairs (2, 3) . So, y[1] = 3.     And x[1] is the x-value of the same coordinate pair. We have to use x[1] = 2 since we used the first coordinate pair...     So we have m = -3/4 , x[1] = 2 and y[1] = 3.     Use these values for the point-slope form:  y - y[1] = m (x - x[1])  y - 3 = -3/4*(x - 2)    You could stop here b/c technically, you do have an equation, but most instructors will ask you to simplify this into slope-intercept form.    y - 3 = -3/4*(x - 2)    [distribute the -3/4]  y - 3 = -3/4x - 2*(-3/4)    [multiply]  y - 3 = -3/4 x + 6/4    [simplify fraction]  y - 3 = -3/4x + 3/2    [Add 3 to each side]  y = -3/4x + 3/2 + 3    [add like terms]  y = -3/4x + 9/2    ------------  Q4. How do I solve the system of equations: x + 2y = 6 and y = -x + 1?    There are several ways to solve this system. I'll choose substitution because it's the easist method with the equations you gave in your problem, because of one of the variables in your two equations is already isolated.    ***THE SUBSTITUTION METHOD***  ***1. replace a variable of one equation with an expression of the other...     In your example, the y= -x +1, so that isolated variable, y, is the one that will get replaced in the first equation:   x + 2y = 6 [replace the y with -x + 1]  x + 2(-x+1) = 6    ***2. Solve for the remaining variable...   |`|4bfzjgbzaa	1. If the slope is 4/3, then the equation y=mx+b has 4/3 as the value of m.  Given the point 3,1 is on the line y = 4/3 x + b, you plug in the values and find 1 = (4/3) 3 + b which simplifies to 1 = 4 + b. Therefore, b = -3. So you graph y = 4/3 x =3.    2. Solve for y.    3. The slope, m, is delta y divided by delta x, so your equation would be y = (14-2)/(-6-3) x + b. That simplifies to y = -4/3 x + b. Plug in the values for either point to get the equation.    4. Substitute (x-1) for y in the first equation to get x + 2 (x-1) = 6.  That wil get you a value of x. Then plug that into y = x+1 to find the value of y.    Alternatively, you could graph both of those equations, and see where the lines cross.    5. The line -y = -2x + 2 isn't an inequality. Neither side of the line is shaded - the line itself is the only thing that's dark.    6. An integer is a whole number, which includes zero, and negative numbers. An even number is one that's positive, and a multiple of 2. So look through the expressions, eliminate any that are negative, and any that don't have a factor of 2.    7. This is a trick question. Don't look at hours per room. Look at rooms per hour. Dale paints 1/5 room per hour. Chip paints 1/7 room per hour. With a common denominator, Dale does 7/35 room per hour and Chip does 5/35 room per hour. Together they do 12/35 room per hour, or 35/12 hours per room. It'd take them 2 hours and 55 minutes. Except that their elbows would get in each other's way, Chip would get mad and storm off, and Dale would do it in about 9 or 10 hours.    8.

Start at point (3,1), which is 3 right from origin in the middle, and is up 1 unit.  Now go right 3 and up 4.  (3 + 3, 1 + 4) is next point.  (3 + 3 + 3, 1 + 4 + 4) is next next point.  (3 + 3 + 3 + 3, 1 + 4 + 4 + 4) is next next next point.  Draw a line through these points.  Now y = (4/3) times x  is a line parallel to the right one, but it needs  to be moved over to the point (3,1) instead of  going thru the origin (0,0)  Hence y = (4/3)x then  becomes (y - 1) = (4/3)(x - 3)  Ain't that a cool way to do it.  The minus 1 to the y moves the line up 1.  The minus 3 to the x moves the line right 3.

Are you being asked to find the slope-intercept equation of a line that contains (3, 1) and has a slope of 4/3? If so ...  Start with y = mx + b  The m is the slope, so that's 4/3. So far, we've got  y = (4/3)x + b  Now, (3, 1) is an (x, y) pair. So you can substitute the 3 in for x and the 1 in for y, and use algebra to solve for b  3 = (4/3)*3 + b  ...etc...  b = -1  So your equation is y = (4/3)x - 1    2. slope-intercept form simply means you use algebra to solve for y. That is, get y by itself on the left hand side of the = sign, with everything else on the other side.    3. Problem solving technique is similar to  1. But you have to figure out the slope first. Use the slope formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). Then continue as in 1.    4. the system is all set up for the SUBSTITUTION method. The equation y = -x+ 1 tells you that you can substitute the (-x+1) in for y in the first equation.  Use algebra to solve for y in THAT result, then back substitute to find the matching x.    5. When shading sides of lines, there's usually an inequality symbol, a less-than or greater-than symbol. . Check the problem again?    6. It's a concept question. All even numbers are multiples of two. So if n is an integer, 2n MUST be an even number.    7. Think about it in terms of HOW MUCH of the room is painted in one hour ...  Dale gets 1/5-th of the room done in one hour. And Chip gets 1/7-th of the room done in one hour. Let's say it takes x hours to get the job done when they're working together. If that's the case, then they get 1/x-th of the room done in one hour.  That 1/x must be the 1/5 that one guy did plus the 1/7 that the other guy did ... gives you an equation!  1/5 + 1/7 = 1/x    8. Solving inequalities is pretty much like solving equalities. Just always make sure you move all the x's to the side where they'll be positive, and you won't have to worry about a pesky rule of switching the direction of the inequality.  So for this example, move the 2x to the right, and the +4 to the left ... -7  -7. That means x can be any number bigger than -7.  Common set notation (that you probably learned in the 4th grade and have never used since) looks like this ...  { x : x > -7}, read aloud is "all real numbers x, such that x is greater than negative 7"
2fqwC58yaa	hola: Mira antes que nada tienes ke saber un pokito de electricidad. En la corriente electrica lo que mata son los amperes, no los volts, si tu agarras unos cables con 120 volts no pasa de ke brinkes i te de cosquillas, pero si tiene un amperaje alto te puede matar esto por que el voltage es la cantidad de electricidad que fluye, y el amperaje es la fuerza, entonces mientras mas volts, mas electricidad, pero mientras mas amperes, mas fuerza. Los clasicos juegos de toques solo aplican voltage es por eso que hasta son un juego por el cual algunos pagan. Entonces, si un rayo cae pero contiene muy poco o nada de amperaje, es probable que no pase nada y que la gente solo sienta un cosquilleo o se le erizen los cabellos.

Calculating the moles of acid and base will tell you the exact amounts you need to completely neutralize them. This relies on your accuracy of weighing out the solid and the exact molarity of NaOH you used. If not, then you will have a slight excess of acid or base.
GASTNilgaa	It depends a little bit on the school, but at most schools I know of (colleges or universities in the US), the class called "calculus II" does indeed cover essentially the same material as AP Calculus BC.  <br>  <br>  Whether something is a prerequisite for something else is usually up to the (completely arbitrary) decisions of individual schools.  At the college I went to, you could get college credit for Calc II if you had passed the BC exam (ie, you got a certain number of units added to the minimum total you needed to graduate), but if you were _majoring_ in a subject that required Calc II, you still had to take the class on campus, because that's the way majors worked.  (Completely random!)<br>  <br>  At most schools, though, "Calc II" is roughly the same set of mathematical topics as Calculus BC.

AA10164889	For that question, "g" would be the correct answer.  There are other units of measure used on very large scales by astronomers and astrophysicists.|`|cKzfxE0Zaa	Well, a light year is exactly 9,460,730,472,580,800 meters, if you use the Julian year. But a parsec is 30,856,775,813,057,289 . 53 meters, to the nearest centimeter, which seems plenty accurate. Accuracy isn't the result of the unit. It's the result of the measurement. So the answer isn't f. On the other hand, there's nothing really uniquely practical about light years, either. Parsecs can be used as easily. Or petameters, for that matter. So g isn't right, either. The correct answer is that light years (and parsecs) are conventionally used. Astronomers have acquired the habit of using them and have a feel for those units that they don't have with substitutes.|`|2181567251632c4e5445096bb9761f26aa	Neither f or g are correct, but g is certainly more correct than f.<br>  <br>  Light years are not the only practical unit (there are AUs and parsecs that may be more practical in some situations).<br>  But the light year is easy to understand, simple to visualize, and a convenient measurement for comparisons between distances.<br>  And it has the added use of also measuring how long it takes light to travel that distance.|`|J3TGyOnDaa	g)<br>  <br>  A parsec is 3.26 light years.

Light year is used on popular literature and media.  Instead, astronomers use:<br>  <br>  - astronomic units (AU) for distances within our Solar System.  The average distance between Earth and the Sun is 1 AU<br>  <br>  - parsecs (pc) and megaparsecs (Mpc) to measure distances between stars, as well as distances on the galactical and inter-galactical scale.  For example, the distance between the Sun and Alpha Centauri is 1.34 pc.<br>  <br>  - redshift (z) to measure extreme distances that are significant on cosmological scale.<br>  <br>  Note for Geoff regarding the use of light years by professional astronomers.  Light years are frequently used in popular science publications, but if you refer to articles in Astrophysical Journals (University of Chicago) or The Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, Mpc are used much more frequently than light years to measure distances between galaxies or LSS.  Also, it's not a coincidence that, for example, the Hubble's constant is most commonly expressed in km s^-1 / Mpc and not km s^-1 / ly.|`|AA12305050	Because the speed of light does not vary and light travels a very long way over the course of a year.<br>  <br>  Since the distances involved are so huge then it's pointless to measure them in km or mega-kilometres.<br>  <br>  Another useful point is that a light year is also an indication of how old the "image" is that we are looking at. For example if we are looking at a galaxy which is 2 million light years away then we are actually seeing it as it looked 2 million years ago because that is how long it has taken the light from that source to reach us.<br>  <br>  Objects in and close to our own solar system are measured in "astronomical units" which is a multiple (or fraction) of the distance between the earth and the Sun.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	I'm surprised by the answers which say that professional astronomers prefer parsecs to light years. Parsecs are mainly used in talking about distances to stars in the immediate neighbourhood of the Sun. For galactic and intergalactic distances, light years are always used.

The fact that the starch solution in the Dialysis bag turned a blue/black colour indicates that some of the Lugol’s iodine from the beaker diffused into the starch solution in the Dialysis bag.  <br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  DIFFUSION is the passive net movement of a substance (e.g., starch, glucose, or Lugols IKI iodine molecules) from an area of high concentration of that substance to an area of low concentration of that substance. For example, if you spray perfume in one corner of the room, in time, that perfume will spread (or diffuse) throughout the whole room.  (In your experiment, the Lugols iodine molecules  and the glucose molecules were able to diffuse freely from one porous container to another.  However, the starch molecules in your experiment were too large to diffuse out of the pores in the Dialysis bag).<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  Some people talk about the diffusion of water: In your experiment, the water was able to move in and out of the various porous containers, but when water passes through a semipermeable membrane, the process is called “OSMOSIS”.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  Which substance diffused from the Dialysis tube into the dilute Lugol's solution in the beaker? Provide laboratory evidence and suggest a reason to explain this. <br>  <br>  The glucose molecules (and the water molecules) were small enough to diffuse through the microscopic holes in the Dialysis bag).  <br>  <br>  The glucose indicator should have indicated the presence of glucose in the water in the beaker.<br>  <br>  By osmosis, water from the beaker should have entered both of the Dialysis bags, and by diffusion, glucose molecules would have diffused out of the Dialysis bag (that you filled with a glucose solution) and into the beaker (that you filled with water and Lugols solution).<br>  <br>  By osmosis, the volume of water in the beaker should have decreased, while the volume of water in each of the Dialysis bags should have increased.  (How much the volumes increased or decreased depended upon the concentrations of the various molecules involved).<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  OSMOSIS is the passive net movement of WATER (never solutes) from a region of LOW concentration OF SOLUTES to a region of HIGH concentration OF SOLUTES through a SEMI-PERMEABLE MEMBRANE along a concentration gradient. (The solutes in your experiment were the starch, glucose and Lugols IKI molecules). <br>  <br>  You could also say that OSMOSIS is the passive net movement of WATER from a region of HIGH “concentration OF WATER” to a region of “LOW concentration WATER” through a semipermeable membrane along a concentration gradient, but the "concentration of water" is an awkward concept.<br>  <br>  **************************************...

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	Warmer moisture laden air has encountered a cooler object. Removing some heat from the warm humid air is what causes condensation to form. The spider web is not unique. It is not that the dew forms only on the spider web, but rather it forms everywhere and you just SEE it more easily on the web as droplets. Run your finger over a leaf next to the spider web and you would see it is covered with a film of water. The same thing happens in a bathroom with the mirror when you take a shower. Warm humid air loses some heat to a cooler object and vapor condenses into liquid water.
ESvJ5JMXaa	As mass increases, the dispersion forces increases. As the dispersion forces increases, so does the boiling point. Therefore, HI has a molecular weight of about 129g and HBr has a molecular weight of about 81g. This causes the boiling point to be greater in HI because it has greater dispersion forces.
LVOPlHquaa	The rule of mixtures applies for elastic modulus.  <br>  <br>  This could be written as:  E(overall)=Ea*Va+Eb*Vb<br>  <br>  where:<br>      Ea is the elastic modulus of material a<br>      Va = volume fraction of material a (=.5 if both are same size)<br>      Eb=elastic modulus of material b<br>      Vb= volume fraction of material b (=.5 if both are same size)<br>  <br>  Therefore, if two equal size materials are glued together, neglecting the imperfection of the glue, the overall elastic modulus is simply the average of the two original values.

High resolution satellite imagery is available only to the military and intelligence services, as the ability to zoom in on a particular area requires the satellite's orbit be altered, a very expensive proposition.<br>  <br>  Sources like Google Earth use images from many sources, primarily aerial photography (from airplanes rather than satellites). Higher resolution imagery is sometimes available on a local basis. For example, Simcoe County, in which I live, has an interactive mapping service online, which uses relatively up-to-date (April 2008) colour aerial photographs of the entire county. This is far more detailed and up-to-date than images of the same area in Google Earth.

(the 3 has a positive exponent originally (+1), so when we take the (-1) of the exponents outside the bracket, we have to make it 3^-1 to keep it the same)<br>  <br>  Now we can invert the whole thing and dispose of the minus signs outside the brackets :<br>  <br>  (2 m^3 n^-7)^2 / (3^-1  m^5 n^3)^3<br>  <br>  Next multiply out the brackets<br>  <br>  2^2 m^6 n^-14 / 3^-3 m^15 n^9<br>  <br>  Now cancel m^6 top and bottom, and tidy up those negative exponents<br>  <br>  2^2 · 3^3 / m^9 n^9 n^14<br>  <br>    =  108 / m^9 n^23<br>  <br>  (I like to do it two different ways, because it is easy to make a mistake with complex expressions like this, and one way is a check that I have done the other way correctly ! )

ViZH5twNaa	organic matter =/= life    Organic matter is any sort of compound that contains carbon. Life is a self replicating cellular organism that can metabolize. Two different things. Life just happens to be made up of a lot of organic matter on Earth.    Anyways, EVERYTHING is controlled by physical laws. Every last photon that hits your eye and every last neurological impulse that flows through your brain and nerves, it is all just a series of dominoes. It is a rock falling down a hill.     "Choice" is an illusion to put it bluntly. For a long time people saw the human mind as an intangible supernatural cloud that worked beyond the limits of the physical universe. The Egyptians didn't even know what the brain was for and just threw it out during mummification! Now we know that the entirety of our consciousness is held within the organic computer we call a brain. Our consciousness is completely dependent on our brain, our brain is made up of physically bound material, thus our consciousness is purely physical. We have no greater consciousness than computers; we just happen to be more complex than modern day computers.    When computers do reach human level intelligence and become just as unpredictable as human minds, what exactly will differentiate their consciousness from ours?|`|yaq7oaH6aa	I agree with your opinion of it's 'strangeness' but organic matter   is not immune to physical laws.

Deformed children ... we can't kill them.  b) It might result in brokering of tissue of talented humans.

s9ZQqhDxaa	If gravitons exist, as per string theory, they are not bound to our dimensional framework (our "brane"). Even though they interact, they are themselves massless (like photons), but unlike photons, are free to move along any dimension. Thus they are not lost in the black hole, and hence there is gravity.    If gravitons don't exist, and gravity is caused by the curvature of space (as per general relativity), than there is no issue of "non-escaping gravitons."    This points to the main problem in theoretical physics. How do we reconcile gravity with the other forces. The other forces of nature can be described as fields quite successfully. Gravity, however, produces infinities in field equations. String theory is one of many theories that attempts to overcome this difficulty. Infinities in the equation violates the planck limits of quantum mechanics (nothing can be smaller or shorter than the planck length, nothing can be hotter than the planck temperature, and nothing can be of shorter duration than the planck interval. These limits are as inviolable as the speed of light and absolute zero for temperature.)    The problem with string theory is that it permits an infinite number of solutions. So what does it do for us? It can't make a valid prediction, because it can't narrow down acceptable answers.    Other (less-known) theories, such as the quantum-loop theory, etc. have other hurtles and aren't as popular right now.    |`|iay43l4qaa	ok gravitons are the thing that causes the gravity of the black hole and they are not hindered by there own force |`|AA10222010	First of all, no such thing as a graviton has ever been detected. They're strictly theoretical.    Better to think of gravity as exactly what Einstein proved it to be...a change (...distortion...) in the geometry of spacetime. Saying that another way...the "force" we call gravity is actually the bending of spacetime caused by the presence of mass; the more mass, the more extreme this bending.    The mass of a black hole is so immense that spacetime is literally curved back on itself,  and since everything like light is embedded in spacetime nothing can escape back into regions of 'normal' spacetime.

i0ypGmlQaa	You calculate a special quantity: the "sum of divisors" for some number.    Call the number "n" -- the quantity you want is called (n). The character  is the Greek letter "sigma" (lowercase).    (n) represents the sum of all the divisors of n (sometimes people don't include n, since n obviously divides itself evenly -- let's assume this is what we want to do).    So for example:    (12) = ??    What are the divisors of 12, besides 12 itself?    12 can be divided evenly by 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. So we add up:    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16    There are three things that can happen:    If (n) = n, then n is called "perfect." The divisors of n add up perfectly to be the number n itself.    If (n) > n, then n is called "abundant." It has lots and lots of divisors, so that they add up to be more than n.    Otherwise, (n)     There are only a few perfect numbers (46 total) that are known. The first few are: 6, 28, 496, 8128. The largest known perfect number has almost 26 million digits.    For more about perfect numbers, read here:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfect_num...

SQGtLHzUaa	First of all, you need to use proper grammar and explain yourself clearly or you won't get anyone to answer you.    TNT is an explosive.  It will not produce a "flame" that you can really measure - the explosion happens too quickly for that.  A bunch of small balls of TNT wouldn't explode simultaneously, literally - but to the human eye/ear it would probably look simultaneous.    TNT is poisonous and requires professional handling.  If you should come upon some of it, just leave it alone and call the police.

asaeVSehaa	It's almost never a good idea to use the range equation, actually.  You're better off splitting the velocity into x and y components, then use the height difference between launch and landing (which may be zero) to find time aloft, then the time aloft to find the horizontal distance traveled.    The speed in the range equation is just the overall magnitude of speed, not a component.  But the equation ONLY works if you land at the same height you launched from.  The method described above will still work when you get a case where the landing spot is at a different height.
J36arjZeaa	You would be doing literature research here, because measuring those differences requires access to a good calorimetric laboratory.  Many of those substances are liquids, which are not very easy to handle in a standard calorimeter.      Why don't you see if you can estimate the efficiency gained by the regenerative braking cycles of a hybrid car in typical city driving? That would be a good project for a science fair.

So the expression described here can be represented by a function with 10 components and each component is defined by a parameter t. That can describe the change to a point or the change to an object at a certain time t.      
ef6cf3191ff018b12219365a4568a2ccaa	Ok. I'll try to be short and understandable. So you'll get it more easily, I'll include the reactions.  Compound A is iron(II)sulphate(VI): FeSO4. If you add solution of BaCl2, white precipitate appears. This is insoluble barium sulphate. Reaction is:  FeSO4 + BaCl2 -> FeCl2 + BaSO4 (s)  If you add NaOH to starting solution, insoluble iron(II)hydroxide is formed. It is usually white but in presence of oxygen you get green color of precipitate. Reaction?  FeSO4 + 2NaOH -> Fe(OH)2 (s) + Na2SO4  If you increase the temperature, water goes out and oxidation occurs also. You get brown powder, which is iron(III)oxide. Reaction is:  2Fe(OH)2 -> Fe2O3 + H2O.  If you add carbon and heat up, reduction occurs and you get iron powder which is magnetic. The reaction that you were actually looking for is therefore:  2Fe2O3 + 3C -> 4Fe + 3CO2  So the compounds, need to be identified are:  A = FeSO4  B = Fe(OH)2  C = BaSO4  D = Fe2O3  E = Fe  Good luck with your test.  Katja|`|HwFRsAahaa	I'm making awild guess here.  A: Ni2+ or Fe2+ (2 more common green solutions)  C: SO4(2-) (White BaSO4 is formed, BaCO3 is ruled out, as it is acidified)  B: Ni(OH)2 or Fe(OH)2  D: Fe2O3 (Rust is formed)  E: Reduction of rust to give iron (paramagnetic)    2Fe2O3 + C -----> 4Fe + 3CO2    Good luck then.
AWPaPV4Eaa	It doesn't lower the melting point of aluminum.  The melting point of aluminum is no problem: it is relatively low at 660C.    The problem instead lies with the melting point of the aluminum oxide (the raw material, produced from bauxite) that will be electrolyzed.  Aluminum oxide melts at 2054C, which is very high.    The cryolite doesn't lower the melting point of the aluminum oxide though - it just dissolves it.  When the aluminum oxide is dissolved in the molten cryolite (melting point around 1000C), its ions are free to move around, and it can be electrolyzed.  This is similar to dissolving common salt in water.

By blowing on the hot wire, you introduce some amount of cooling, and the cooler electrons will be more easily influenced by the applied current; so when you blow on the hot wire, the measured current increases.

Therefore you have half a mol of methanol, and so it will produce half the -170.9 kcal produced in one mol of reaction. Therefore, 85.45 kcal of heat are produced.    so one calorie of heat will heat one gram of water 1 degree celsius. one kcal (= one kilocalorie, or one thousand calories) will heat 1000 grams (one kilogram) of water.

Whether a substance floats or not is due to its density relative to what it is put into. Density is unit weight (mass) per unit volume. For example kilograms per cubic meter. Water's density is 1 gram per cubic centimeter. Wood has a lower density, therefore it floats. Steel has a higher density so it sinks.     When water freezes (turns to ice) it expands (unlike most other substances, which contract). Because it expands, the same weight occupies a greater volumer, so it's density decreases. Hence ice's density is lower than water's so it floats. (Ice floats in freshwater too.)

99b9d77532164e17cd232b5ac3234a62aa	The question is basically asking how far the car goes before the driver applies the breaks.  The driver's reaction time is .75 seconds.  The car is going at 58 km/hr.  First convert that to seconds so that it's compatible with the driver's reaction time.  Remember that units can cancel.    58km/hr x 1 hr/3600s = .016 km/s    Now that you know the speed of the car in terms of seconds, multiply by the driver's reaction time.    .016 km/s x .75 s = .012 km    But you're still not done.  Convert .012 km to meters.    .012 km x 1 km/1000m = 12 meters    The car travels 12 meters before it begins to slow.|`|EZfHq18Taa	ok average speed is = distance travelled / time    so just rearrage the formula and multiply 0.75 s by the 58 km/h >> convert to m/s to get the displacement.

QKO4f5q0aa	Because of the tides.    The moon causes tides on the earth.  The rotation of the earth moves the bulge of the tides eastward of the moon.  The bulge has it's own gravity, and it pulls the Moon eastward a little bit, which transfers some of the angular momentum from the Earth to the Moon.  This causes the Moon to be accelerated in its orbit.  Orbital dynamics dictates that this causes the Moon to rise up in its orbit (forward takes you up).      So, the Earth is gradually slowing down (about 1.70 ms/century), and the Moon is gradually getting farther away (3.8 cm/yr)|`|159af8323864a89fbd6da78461d571f4aa	The earth is rotating faster.  There is a bulge that forms form gravity or tidal forces of the moon.  That little bulge pulls a little bit more and it accelerates the moon about and inch or two a year farther in orbit.  That energy is taken away from our rotation or day length.  That effect is why it is common for objects like the moon to become gravitationally locked.|`|ftwGaZ4Uaa	Because the moon gains momentum from Earth by the tidal forces. The moon slows Earths rotation down, with it's gravity. As there is a reaction for each action, the moon gains momentum at the same rate, Earth looses it. the Moon becomes faster on it's way around Earth.     When the moon becomes faster, and by the gravity of Earth staying constant (constant centripetal force), the curve the moon makes around Earth (the orbit) gets a larger radius - the moon spirals away from Earth.    At 4 cm per year.    This process will stop and possibly reverse, when the moon needs as long for a orbit around Earth, as Earth needs for one rotation. This will happen in about 7 billion years, when the length of a day on Earth is equal to 48 days today.|`|gqaZP4R3aa	maybe its either a full moon or the one with no lite reflecting i think its called a new moon aint sure.

We also know that Y is equal to -10x-5, right? If we set these two equations equal to each other, we can find out what "x" is. If we know what "x" is, we can solve the equation and find out what "y" is.     Here's what that would look like:    Solving for X:    The goal here is to combine the "x's" or "variables" and set them equal to a real number like "5" or "16". To do this, set the equations equal to each other like this:    Step 1:  5x + 15 = -10x - 5    Now we need to simplify the equations we have and we do so by undoing whatever is extra. Here's a quick example: "x + 8" If you wanted only "x, we would need to get rid of the extra part which is +8. What is the opposite of adding 8?  Subtracting it. So in order to undo the +8 we need to subtract 8. But here's an important rule to remember:    When you undo something on one side of a function you also need to do it on the other side of the equals sign. This will all make sense in a minute.    Here's what that would look like:    Look up at the equation under step 1. Now pick a side. (Either the side LEFT to the equals sign which would be 5x + 15 or the side to the RIGHT of the equals sign which would be -10x  5.) I'm going to go with the RIGHT side.     Here's the right side:  -10x  5    Looking at the X, what are the extra parts? Remember what we learned before? The extra parts to the x is the -5 or subtracting five AND the -10 multiplied. You need to undo what is happening to the x. What is the opposite of subtracting five? The opposite is ADDING five. So to undo the subtracting 5, we need to add 5.     Remember the rule though, whatever happens to one side also needs to happen to the other side. SO, if we add five to the right side, we must also add five to the left side.     Step 2:    Before Adding 5 to both sides:  5x + 15 = -10x  5    After Adding 5 to both sides:  5x + 15 + 5 = -10x    Now you can simplify the left side. 15 + 5, we can solve that on our own.    Our new equation is now:  5x + 20 = -10x    Do you remember our goal? When we're done, we want to problem to look something like this:    x = some number    That means, we've reached a point where we can COMBINE the number of x's we have. Right now, on the left side, we have 5 x's cause it's 5 times x, right? On the left side we have negative 10 x's. How would I undo 5x on the other side? If we subtract 5x, what will that look like? Solve this simple problem:    5x  5x = ???    It's equal to zero, so we undo the x, BUT REMEMBER, whatever we do to one side, which in this case was subtract 5 x's, we need to do to the other. So it would look something like this:    5x  5x + 20 = -10x  5x    Once we simplify we get:    20 = -15x    Now, if we had only x by itself, we would know what x alone is equal to, right? How do we undo -15 time x? What's the opposite of multiplication? Division, so we would divide by -15. Remember our rule!     20/-15 = -15x/-15    -1.33333 = x    We now know what X is!!! So if we know what X is, we can go back to ONE of our original problems:    y = 5x + 15            or             y = -10x  5    Lets pick the left problem. Just replace X with what you now know it is, (-1.33333).     It would look like this:    y = 5*(-1.33333) + 15    When solved, it looks like this:    y = 8.3333333    Now we know Y!

05e0c89d259c567203ac41de8d961e11aa	Let me show you think with a smaller number: 4    To get 10 blocks total, you add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.    So you need to add all of the positive integers up, up until your final step number. With a small number of steps (like 4), it is easy to add 1, 2, 3, and 4. But with 10, 50, and 100, it would take a long time to add the numbers.    But...there is a pattern. Let's try this with 10 steps. Add the first and last numbers:  1 + 10 = 11  Now add the second and second-to-last numbers  2 + 9 = 11  etc.    You will note that with an even number of steps, you just need to add the first and last number, multiply it by half of the larger number, and VOILA!!!    Let me show you the long way with 10 steps:  1+10 = 11  2+9 = 11  3+8 = 11  4+7 = 11  5+6 = 11    Now, half of the largest number is 5 (half of 10 is 5).    So, multiply the sum of the extremes, 11, by half the largest number, 5 to get a total of 55 blocks.    The formula would read like this:    total number of blocks = (n+1)*(n/2)  where n = the total number of steps.    Using the formula for 10 steps:  n = 10  total = (10 + 1)*(10/2) = (11)*(5) = 55 blocks.    We can easily verify this. Just add 1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8+9+10 and you'll get 55.    For the other two:    n = 50  total = (50 + 1)*(50/2) = (51)*(25) = 1275 blocks    n = 100  total = (100 + 1)*(100/2) = (101)*(50) = 5050 blocks    The formula works for even AND odd numbers.

However, spring force is calculated as F = -k*x. Where F is the force (lbs), k is the spring constant (lbs/ft), and x is the distance (ft) the spring is stretched from it's position without any weight (or force) applied to it.     A real-world spring has many more variables involved. You'll need to know what material it is made of, what the diameter of the "wire" that makes up the coil, etc, in order to know if it can handle 15 lbs of weight. I hope that helps you some, even though it is not a definitive answer. However, I believe you should be able to contact a company that makes springs, and give them the 15 lb figure, and they should be able to match up a spring for you. But remember, from the equation above, 15 lbs will stretch your spring according to:    x = F/k    They might want to know how far you expect your spring to stretch given a 15 lb load on it.

R0Ogy5qlaa	[sinx] takes on only three values.  It is 1 when x is at the top of the unit circle (but that will contribute nothing to the integral since it happens only at isolated points), it is 0 when x is in the first and second quadrants, it is -1 when x is in the third and fourth quadrants.      So the only non-zero contribution to the integral happens when x is in the bottom half of the unit circle.  From 0 to (2n-1)pi this happens (n - 1)pi of the time and the value of [sinx] there is -1.  So the answer is     -(n - 1)pi.|`|K6QlFoo0aa	This is really pretty straightforward.  Let GIF be the greatest integer function.    Over the interval(0, 2), sin(x) is positive in the first and second quadrants and negative in the third and fourth quadrants.    Since GIF(sin(x)) takes on the value 1 in the first two quadrants, the area under that part of the function from (0, ) is .  In the third and fourth quadrant, since the sine is negative GIF(sin(x)) = 0 nothing is added to the area under (0, 2).    Thus the area under the GIF(sin(x))  from 0 to 2 is .    For (2n - 1) , there were ((2n - 2) / 2) = (n - 1) complete cycles and the sum of their areas was (n - 1)*  Since over [2 -2, 2 - 1] the sine is positive, that adds another  to the sum.    So the answer is (n * ).....  -------------------------
WPPIaLORaa	The genomic comparisons of the DNA from different organisms show the changes in the DNA that differentiate among species.   That is, one can construct a genomic tree that shows how new life forms have different DNA that previous forms.      When many species are sequenced, one can see that there is a tree-like arrangement of relationships based on the number of changes to the DNA.  The more closely the DNA matches from two species, the more closely related they are and the more recently that they had a common ancestor.|`|77412bb9d7b8758e0a32f247da6eaed4aa	Actually, I'd say its a good argument *against* Evolution.

cqidLRdqaa	When a person is in a coma, they are completely unresponsive, meaning their will be no open eyes or communication as far as I know. (It is said that people in comas can still hear, but whether or not this is true is unknown to me.) I don't think there is any way of telling how long a coma may last. It is possible to die while in a coma, but unless the person was seriously injured, there isn't much chance of it as long as they're getting proper care. Good luck!|`|PdxMOlcaaa	Your answer would depend on a lot of factors.  Some coma's are induced by medication when there is serous head trauma.  Coma doesn't mean certain death.  You should talk to a person in a coma, but if the person is in ICU trauma unit that might not be possible, because of the level of care involved.  You need to talk to someone who can give you more information about this person.  It takes time to heal and the brain is amazing, coma is not a death sentence.

If you know an angle and a side, but don't know the other side, use the inverses which should be on your calculator.

Then add 15 to both sides. get 7n = 4n + 13. then subtract 4n from both sides. get 3n = 13. divide by 13. Your answer should be n= 3/13    4. Distribute. get 6n-12-12+6n= 2n+1. Combine like terms. get   12n-24=2n+1. add 24 to both sides. get 12n = 2n + 25. Subtract 2n from both sides. get 10n=25. Divide both sides by 10.

siQjKX0laa	Hm, a "toughie" as we used to say back in the day. Well, let me get out my pad of paper and a pencil, he-he. Looks to this old-timer like    f(x) - f(a) = (a^2 - x^2) / (a^2 x^2)    Well, so far so good, but gracious you'll certainly want to check my work. Can't find my readers so I'm really not sure what I'm typing on this computer. Well now young lady, I hope you remember your lesson on factoring? If you do, then by jings you'll recall that a^2 - x^2 = (a - x) (a + x). Now we're getting somewhere. That lets you know that    f(x) - f(a) = (a - x) (a + x) / (a^2 x^2)    Still with me? Never thought this old timer could hang with something like this so long LLO! So if you divide that by x - a, like your teacher assigned in the first place, you end up with something like    (f(x) - f(a)) / (x - a) = - (a + x) / (a^2 x^2)    Looks like your were correct all along! Congratulations.|`|185b6ca0821b85808a5f7b89593e1f97aa	f(x)= 1/x^2 find [f(x)-f(a)]/(x-a)    [1/x^2 - 1/a^2]/(x-a) =  (a^2 - x^2)/a^2x^2/ (x-a)  = -(x+a)/x^2a^2  as a^2-x^2 = (a-x)(a+x) = - (x-a)(x+a)    so Yes your right   its better(??) to have the sign at the top.

a9dd122f6e9e49753e088e4b5d0b3c65aa	There are too many variables to give you an accurate answer.  The road surface or coefficient of friction would change the distance of the skid.  Did the car stop at the tree, hit it and stop or hit it and keep sliding.  If so, how far and what is the weight of each?  Are all wheels locked and sliding? ABS?      Long story short, determining vehicle speed from straight   skids only, only gives a minimum speed, not true speed.      EDIT:  Now that a few hours has passed and I read the question again, I realized I mis-read your question.  The answer is 3.0971 m/s    I figured the initial velocity based on the skid distance, time and acceleration.  I then figured the ending velocity based on initial velocity, acceleration and time.  To wit:    Vi= initial velocity  Ve= ending velocity  a= acceleration  d=distance  t=time    Vi= d/t - a(t)/2  Ve= Vi + a(t)    Oh, and I converted to feet to do the math, its easier for me as I am a metric neanderthal.  sorry about the confusion early on.|`|RZF5KgiEaa	3.097 m/s.

So you start with 6 feet/sec. there are 5280 feet/mile, so you divide by 5280 so that the feet will cancel out and you get 6/5280 miles/sec. Now you get rid of the sec with 3600 sec/hour. Multiply 6/5280 by 3600 and you end up with 4.09 miles/hour. When canceling unites out, just remember that one needs to be above the line, one needs to be below.|`|s2z7PCAeaa	so you got 6ft/sec  and there is 5,280 feet in miles so you divide  6 by 5,280 (your scale factor)  you get approx .00114mile  so now you got .00114mile/sec  and there is 3600 secs in an hour so multiply  .00114 by 3,600  you get 4.104miles/hr    so answer is.....    4.104miles/hour

We got to the moon first because we were losing the space race. The russian were the first to send a probe in space and send human in space. It was during the cold war that cause us to get in the space race fast as possible because we don't want to be beaten by other counties. Hope this help.

cb36d71046b7619f8bf36c9cf3890c61aa	Question 1:  The base of the triangular prism is a right triangle.  This means that the two shorter lengths given are the height and length, and the longer length is the hypotenuse.  So, 3 and 4 are your height and length.  Now, the formula for the Volume of a prism is the area of the Base times the height, or V = B * h    So, we need to first find the area of the Base, which is a triangle.  The area of a triangle is 1/2 the base times height, or A = 1/2 b * h  A = 1/2 * 3 * 4   A = 6... which is the area of the Base...plug this into the first equation.    V = B * h  V = 6 * 7  V = 42 in^3      Question 2:  You are wanting to find out the surface area of the exact shape as above.  Well, you already know the area of the base, which is 6 in^2.  This would also be the area of the top of the prism, which is the same triangle.  Now, you need the area of the 3 vertical sides.  Each has a height of 7in, and the lengths of each side are 3, 4, and 5.   SA= 2B + 3h + 4h + 5h  SA= 2*6 + 3*7 + 4*7 + 5*7  SA = 12 + 21 + 28 + 35  SA = 96 in^2      Question 3:  We already know that the volume of any prism is the area of the base, times the height, or V = B * h...therefore  V = 125 * 5  V = 625 cubic units

Note:  Since it is a regular pentagon then each interior angle would be 108?.    An easier thing to remember is that for any polygon the sum of the exterior angles equals 360?.  Then if the polygon is regular the interior angles are the supplements of the exterior angles.         GL   ?   ?

If this property is met, a triangle is possible.    14 + 9 = 23 > 6  14 + 6 = 20 > 9  6 + 9 = 15 > 14    The reason the triangle inequality is required is this: if two sides summed to the same length as the remaining one, the two pieces would have to be in a straight line to go that same distance - you'd have 3 overlapping line segments instead of a triangle!  And if two sides were to sum to less than the third, the two together couldn't even reach from one side of the third to the other.|`|z6ZNrN2paa	Yes

It's a lot easier to type that method here than Newton's:    Solve the equation for one of the x's    x = 2 - exp(x)/4    guess x = 1    x2 = 2 - e/4 = 1.32043    x3 = 2 - e^(1.32043)/4 = 1.06374    x4 = 2 - e^(1.06374)/4 = 1.2757    x5 = 2 - e^1.2757/4 = 1.1047    x5 = 2 - e^(1.1047)/4 = 1.24542    If you continue this, it'll eventually converge to the answer you want.

IUmAflSqaa	So we're assuming that N is a normal subgroup (so we can take the quotient group G/N).  Also, I just like to keep my notation consistent: G/N typically denotes left cosets, i.e. cosets aN, while N\G denotes right, i.e. cosets Na.  Not a big deal, since normality implies aN = Na, but it's good practice to be careful with notation.    Suppose a has finite order o(a) in G.  This means the cyclic subgroup  has order o(a).  Furthermore, note that the image of  under the map G -> G/N is the cyclic subgroup generated by .  So we have a surjective map  ->> , which implies that  is finite (being the image of a finite group), say of order m.  This means aN has finite order m.  Also, we know that:    o(a) = || = |kernel(->)|*|| = nm    where n is some integer.  So m divides o(a).
dbXGxntYaa	Yes, you take the remainder.  So 10 MOD 78 is 10, because 78 goes into 10 zero times and leaves a remainder of 10.    The true/false expressions are called "Boolean" expressions, named after George Boole who was the chap who formalised the technique for handling them.  Look up "Boolean algebra" on wikipedia.org for a full explanation.    The result of the expression (A and B) is true only if both A and B are true. If either A or B is false then the result is false.    The result of the expression (F or G) is true if either or both of F or G is true.  If neither F nor G is true (ie both are false) then the result is false.    Your expression "A and B or C and D" is evaluated as "(A and B) or (C and D)", because conventionally an "and" is evaluated before an "or" just as multiplication is evaluated before addition in arithmetic. Substituting the given values of A, B, C and D gives "(false and true) or (false and true)" which produces the result "(false) or (false)" which produces the result "false".

aIBc4faGaa	The proposition can be restated as if p is a prime number > 3, then     p^2 - 1 is divisible by 24.     First let's factor the expression, since it is the difference of two squares.    (p -1)(p + 1) = p^2 -1    We know that p is an odd number, so both of the terms on the left must be even, and since they are consecutive even numbers, one must be divisible by 4.  This gives us 3 factors of 2 altogether.    We also know that p - 1, p, and p + 1 are three consecutive integers, so at least one must be divisible by 3, but p is a prime greater than three, so it must be either p + 1 or p - 1.    Therefore we have shown that the product of p + 1 and p - 1 has factors  2*2*2*3 = 24.    Q.E.D.
AA10927246	Let x represent Mr. Zero's house number.    Since he is in the middle:  To his left will be x-2.  To his right will be x+2.  Two houses left will be x-4  Two houses right will be x+4  etc.    We immediately notice that for every house to the left, the house to the right will cancel out the +/- term to get 2x.    But they didn't tell us how many houses are on either side of Mr. Zero.  Let's say there were k houses to the left and k houses to the right.  They will add up to 2k(x) and then Mr. Zero's house will make it 767.    2kx + x = 767    Factor out an x:  x(2k + 1) = 767  x = 767/(2k + 1)    2k+1 is an odd number.  The factors of 767 are 1, 13, 59 and 767.    We know x can't be 1 or 767 because that would mean we would either have negative house numbers or only one house in town (Mr. Zero's).    That leaves 13 or 59.  Again, with 13, we will have negative house numbers, so the answer is 59.  That means k = 6.

All 7 of the people they hired were from the EATM graduating class of May 2001.  Many of our students want to train marine mammals - we send graduates all over the world to do this. Especially to the Caribbean - a new Dolphin Program hired 4 graduates in the summer of 2001, and more in 2002, 2003 & 2004.  The May 2003 graduates currently have many wonderful jobs. One is working in Shamu Stadium at Sea World in San Diego, training the Killer Whales! (His photo is to the right) Several others are with Universal Studios - both in Orlando and Hollywood. Others are with various Marine Mammal facilities in the U.S. and abroad. Graduates from the class of 2004 are working training Guide Dogs in California, with marine mammals at Sea World Orlando, Sea Life Marine Park in Hawaii, Six Flags Marine World in Vallejo, California - and many other facilities. Graduates from the class of 2008 have jobs at - Sea World San Diego, the U.S. Navy training sea lions, Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut, Universal Studios Hollywood - and many other places.

zCSUlmmPaa	The reciprocal of something is just the number flipped. For example, 5/8 would be 8/5.

qaMPEdL2aa	With addition and subtraction each place value is a coefficient of a different power of ten and you must add and subtract coefficients of like powers.  In multiplication and division, the you operate on both the coefficient and the power of ten. You just need to keep them in the correct order.|`|1SILUqDtaa	in adding and substracting, you have to add and subtract the correct place values    in multiplying and dividing, we multiply and divide each place value as many times as needed, so it does not matter where you place the decimals|`|Ja9pLb6xaa	Because you can't subtract/add inaccurate place values from different place holders    With multiplication and division the place values are taken care of after the problem by adjusting the decimal's position depending on the amount of numbers behind the decimal.|`|hx3BRsoXaa	You need to line up the columns when you add and subtract because you need to add and subtract from the correct place value.  You need to subtract the 1's from the 1's and the, 1/100's from the 1/100's.    When you multiplying and dividing it doesn't matter because you move the decimal place backwards places to however many places values you have after the decimals.  For instance. If 1.1x.5 is the problem you can multiply 11x5 and get 55, but since in the orignal problem we have 2 place amounts total after the decimals, it moves our decimal to the left from the end and it makes our answer .55|`|763210585cf90b03db2c09e7d2e2154daa	That's because in addition and subtraction, you're subtracting decimals and if you didn't, you would mess up your answer because you could subtract tenths from a number in the ones place, etc. If you multiply, you can line them up, but it wouldn't make a difference because at the end, you get a number and you add in the decimals.|`|ypyuMPYYaa	When you subtract, you have to line up the decimals because if not, you would have to subtract diagonally. Ex:      +31.2         .31     if you subtracted this, there would be two decimals..        Now when your miltiplying, it doesnt matter because one might have the decimal in a different place than the other   Ex:      x 3.31       1.2      if you lined up the decimals, you would have to put a zero on the top number. Essentially, 3.1 is the same thing as 3.10, so why put the zero if you dont need to?|`|oRdw13XEaa	because when u add there are more possibilitys then 2 numbers behind the decimal point
MGDV8Q8vaa	A "formula unit" of an ionic compound is analogous to a "molecule" of a covalent compound. So there are 6.02 x 10^23 formula units in a mole.    4.22 moles MgCl2 x (6.02 x 10^23 formula units / 1 mole MgCl2) = 2.54 x 10^24 formula units.    Each formula unit of MgCl2 contains two Cl- ions.    2.54 x 10^24 formula units MgCl2 x (2 Cl- ions / 1 formula unit MgCl2) = 5.08 x 10^24 Cl-ions

KHjYq2bHaa	Very happy to help.    In addition and subtraction of any numbers, you have to line up the place values, i.e., the ones line up, then the 10s column, then the 100s colums and so on. Like this:     1 0 0  +  1 0  --------   1 1 0  --------    Adding and subtracting decimals are the same. You need to line up the tenths, hundredths, thousandths,... columns.    Multiplying decimals, as you're probably aware of is just straight-forward multiplication. The final answer has the total number of decimal places of the two numbers you were multiplying.  0.2 (one decimal) X 0.12 (2 decimal places) = 0.024 (3 decimal places).    Division of decimals, you still do have to line up the decimal point. Especially doing it this way:           5 . 2 8     ________  2 ) 1 0 . 5 6    Hope that helps!    Umm the formatting is wrong, just a quick edit. I can't fix it up, so the above division might not line up properly!|`|51f4071a07575af477379fe0714d0914aa	for subtrac/addition its to make sure that u dont add/subtract the wrong digit and for multiplaction and division it doesnt matter bcuz u have to do either digit anyway.|`|CjY63J7paa	http://www.math.com/school/subject1/less...    I don't know if this link will help, but my thought is that adding and subtracting you are staying with the same number of decimal places and with * & / you put the decimal in after you do the equation

DVUbaABNaa	The problem is that sin 0 2/2=1.|`|D4Ko5ll2aa	Assuming that by 0 you mean the greek letter theta, we can solve this either by:    a) using a calculator  b) simply knowing what the answer is (it's something that most people learn in their maths education sooner or later)  c) constructing a triangle with an angle of theta    We will do c). The sin ratio is opposite over hypotenuse, right? So if we had a right-angled triangle with a hypotenuse of 2 units, and a leg with the length of the square root of 2 units, then the triangle will contain the angle.    Now, if that's the case, what would be the length of the other leg? Let it be a, and we'll figure it out based on pythagoras's theorem.    a^2 + (sqrt(2))^2 = 2^2  a^2 + 2 = 4  a^2 = 2  a = sqrt(2)    So, in fact, what we get is an isosceles right angled triangle, since the legs are the same lengths. That means that the "base angles" (i.e. the angles that are not 90 degrees) are the same, right? It's a rule in geometry. Another rule in geometry is that all angles must add to give 180 degrees. So, if we let a base angle be x, then:    x + x + 90 = 180  2x + 90 = 180  2x = 90  x = 45    Hence, both angles in this triangle containing theta are 45 degrees. Hence, theta is 45 degrees.    You also, perhaps, could have figured it out by reverse rationalisation of the denominator. All you do is take sqrt(2) / 2 and multiply sqrt(2) on the top and bottom (it doesn't change the fraction if you multiply the same number on top and bottom).    sqrt(2) / 2 = [sqrt(2) * sqrt(2)] / [2 * sqrt(2)]  = 2 / [2 * sqrt(2)]  = 1 / sqrt(2)    You might recognise sin(45) = 1 / sqrt(2) more easily than the original equation.

ycbkzprjaa	Magnesium is a metal of the alkaline earths (group II). That automatically makes it at least a reactive metal. Sure, you may see Mg ribbon, magnesium wheels and other sorts of products made with magnesium, but these are usually alloyed with another element to make it more stable. Pure Mg will, in good time, oxidize, get wet from moisture and combine with other elements. There are very few elements that are found free in nature. Magnesium is definitely not one of them.

Religion is based on a set of beliefs that teach you that if you follow out set rules you will get to heaven or get a superior beings blessing .

Also, like with anything in life, we tend to feel comfortable with people or things we are familiar with or understand. We often view differences or things we dont understand as threatening or challenging.     It is not necessarily religions fault, more the way some people interpret it.

So you should start thinking of another question now, before I start getting bored.......|`|yNvA3Wreaa	I think you're mixing things up.  There is no one selfish gene, all genes can be thought of as selfish.  It's just a description of the fact that genes exist to propagate more genes, and the genes that do this the best at all costs spread most effectively through the population.      Religion probably does have a genetic basis, resulting from the construction of our brains and their way of interpreting the world.  But there is no gene that dictates the person who possesses it has one religion or the other.      People tend to treat those of their religion preferentially because our brains classify people with key similarities as people in our ingroup.  Ingroup members are treated with more kindness than outgroup members, who are often persecuted.  This tactic of favoring the ingroup while ostracizing the outgroup was evolutionarily a good strategy, since it propagated a person's genes by favoring those of the ingroup, who were most likely genetically related, while acting to destroy the outgroup, who are not genetically related.      Things have become more complicated than they were in the Pleistocene when ingroup favoritism/outgroup eradication was a winning strategy, but we still retain these attitudes.
WRyHOEjSaa	It's unlikely that giving to charities would help others with similar genes more than it would help others with dissimilar genes. Other, more likely reasons include:     1) The giver actually gains at least as much as she loses in terms of fitness. She doesn't give up anything she seriously needs, and she gains a reputation as a "good" person who would function well in a coalition.    2) The giver encourages others to give as well, and is thus more likely to be able to depend on those others for help when she needs it.    3) The altruistic behavior is a side effect of other behaviors that were the actual driving force supporting selection of the genes involved.

It's the ideas that genes that act in ways to propagate themselves (hence "selfish") - which can include "non-selfish" things like helping others and gaining through reciprocation - are the most successful and thus multiplied.    In any case, while the term works perfectly fine when understood.  Regardless, I think it still sucks because it's not a particularly robust term (as many people misinterpret it - and who can blame them).    Human's are a terrible study subject for evolution in the manner your question asks, because we have culture which includes 1. cultural selection 2. just plain higher thinking.    Animal charities certainly fall in to this, and both cultural selection (1) and a greater sense of morality (2), both apply.    And while I can think of scenarios where the "selfish gene" and "animal charities" go together, I think it's simply that it's the right thing to do, and we humans can do it.
31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    On every type of factoring problem ALWAYS look first for a GCF, a greatest common factor. There won't always be one, but if there is, you should divide it out first. A GCF will carry along through the problem and be the first thing in an answer with a GCF.    Now we are going to look at problems with only 2 terms. Even on these, always check first for a GCF. Then the problems could be the difference of perfect squares, the difference of perfect cubes, or the sum of perfect cubes. First we will look at the difference of perfect squares.    Suppose you had 4x2 - 81  This is the difference of perfect squares. 4x2 is really (2x) squared. 81 is 92. So both factors start with 2x and both end with 9. One binomial has a "-" and the other has a "+".    The factors are (2x - 9)(2x + 9).    Suppose you had 16a2 - 49  This is the difference of perfect squares. 16a2 is really (4a) squared. 49 is 72. So both factors start with 4a and both end with 7. One binomial has a "-" and the other has a "+". The order does not matter.    The factors are (4a + 7)(4a - 7).    Suppose you had 18x2 - 50  18 and 50 are not perfect squares because no number times itself equals either 18 or 50. The problem is that we did not look first for a GCF! This time both terms are divisible by 2. If we divide that out first, we get:  2(9x2 - 25) Now we have a difference of perfect squares!  Keep the GCF of 2 out front. The parentheses has a difference of perfect squares. 9x2 is really (3x) squared. 25 is 52. So both factors start with 3x and both end with 5. One binomial has a "-" and the other has a "+".    The factors are 2(3x - 5)(3x + 5).    Suppose you had 16x^4 - 81  This is the difference of perfect squares. 16x^4 is really (4x2) squared. 81 is 92. So both factors start with 4x2 and both end with 9. One binomial has a "-" and the other has a "+". The order does not matter.    (4x2 + 9)(4x2 - 9) This is correct so far, but it is not done this time. Notice that with x2 in terms with 4 and 9, that they are perfect squares again, so the factor that is the DIFFERENCE of perfect squares can factor again. (The sum of perfect squares can not factor.) So (4x2 - 9) factors again into:    (4x2 + 9)(4x2 - 9)   (4x2 + 9)(2x - 3)(2x + 3)     Now we're going to look at the sum and difference of perfect cubes. Again always look first for a GCF. If there is one, factor it out. Perfect cube problems will always factor into a binomial times a trinomial, like this:     x3 + 125 = (x + 5)(x2 - 5x + 25)    The general rule for these is:    1) Factor out a GCF if there is one.  2) Make 2 parentheses for a binomial and a trinomial.  3) The sign from the problem goes in the binomial. The opposite sign from what you just used goes in the trinomial, and is always followed by a "+" as the second sign in the trinomial. This is the only step where what you do is different on the sum of cubes from on the difference of cubes.  4) Figure out what you would cube to get the first term of the problem and put that expression as the first term of your binomial. Then figure out what you would cube to get the second term of the problem and put that expression as the second term of your binomial.  5) Your trinomial already has its signs, so don't worry about the signs. To find terms of the trinomial, write the first term of your binomial 3 times followed by the second term of your binomial 3 times out to the side. Multiply the first 2 things together to get the trinomial's first term. Multiply the next 2 things together to get the trinomial's middle term. Multiply the last 2 things together to get the trinomial's third term.    So for, x3 + 125, there is no GCF.  Parentheses would be ( + )( - + )  To get x3, you'd cube x.  To get 125, you'd cube 5.  So your binomial becomes (x + 5)( - + )  Now write x x x 5 5 5  x*x = x2  x*5 = 5x  5*5 = 25  So your trinomial becomes (x + 5)(x2 - 5x + 25)    Here's another example:    So for 8x3 + 27y3, there is no GCF  Parentheses would be ( + )( - + )  To get 8x3, you'd cube 2x.  To get 27y3, you'd cube 3y.  So your binomial becomes (2x + 3y)( - + )  Now write 2x 2x 2x 3y 3y 3y  2x*2x = 4x2  2x*3y = 6xy  3y*3y = 9y2  So your trinomial becomes (2x + 3y)(4x2 - 6xy + 9y2)    I' m going to explain factoring trinomials the way that I teach it, which is probably different from what you've done. Try to follow the steps. This method will work on any trinomial.    3y2 - 13y - 10 Look for a GCF None this time. If there was one, factor it out. Then temporarily start both parentheses with the first number and variable.   (3y.......)(3y..........) First sign goes in first parentheses.  (3y..-....)(3y..........) Product of signs goes in 2nd parentheses.  (3y..-....)(3y...+.....)     Now multiply your first and third numbers together. Ignore their signs - you've already done them. 3 x 10 = 30 So, out to the side list pairs of factors of 30.     30  ------  1, 30  2, 15  3, 10  5, 6    Now you want to pick which factors go in your parentheses, using these rules:    If the signs you put on your parentheses are the SAME, find the factors that ADD up to the middle number in the problem.   If the signs you put on your parentheses are the DIFFERENT, find the factors that SUBTRACT to the middle number in the problem. (Note you look at signs in the parentheses, not in the problem.)    (3y..-....)(3y...+.....) Your signs are different, so you want to subtract factors to get 13. Those factors are 2 and 15. ( Notice that 3 and 10 would have added to 13, so you HAD to know to subtract this time.) When you put the number

This happens because the waves travel at fixed speed through the medium and the source is also traveling through the medium (though slower than the waves). Take a look at the diagram in the link below.    When the waves are compressed, the wavelength is shorter and the frequency is higher. The opposite happens in the other direction.

f0WUWKDraa	try u=5-2x in the first integral.   then 2x=5-u, x=(5-u)/2 and du=-2dx.   limits become u=5-0=5 and u=5-5=0 ie from 5 to 0.  integral becomes  ((5-u)/2)sqrt(u)(-du/2) = -(1/4)(5-u)sqrt(u)du  we can remove the minus by changing the order of the limits.  and we can replace u with x, because u is a "dummy variable" (it doesn't matter what name we give it, it's the form of the function which matters).  so the integral is equal to (1/4)(5-x)sqrt(x)dx from 0 to 5.
w2nfvZ0caa	Related rates ftw? Sike.    So what you do is you have to first find the equation for the problem. The problem says that the tank is being filled, so I'd say go with the volume equation for a cylinder:    V = r2h    Leave that alone for a while. The problems tells you the volume that is filled up per minute (the change in volume with respect to time), which is 3 m3/min. It also tells you the radius. The radius of the tank stays constant throughout the problem. Knowing this, take the derivative of the equation with respect to time (it's like implicit differentiation with EVERY VARIABLE). Use the product rule:    dV/dt = [(2r*dr/dt)(h) + (r2)(dh/dt)]    Now you can distribute "":    dV/dt = 2hr(dr/dt) + r2(dh/dt)    Now we can start plugging in. I'll use lots of parenthesis to keep all of the terms separate:    3 = (2)()(h)(0) + ()(52)(dh/dt)    Simplify and solve for "dh/dt":    3 = ()(52)(dh/dt)  3 = (25)(dh/dt)  3/25 = dh/dt  0.0382  dh/dt    So, the height of the water is increasing at a rate of approximately 0.0382 meters per minute.    I hope this is the right answer because we just learned this in class, so I'm not a complete expert at it yet. :) Good luck though.

31f743411a42c3a8de21b1c9c1b15871aa	Hi,    f(x) = (x+1)2 - 2 is a quadratic function. This equation is written in vertex form, f(x)= a(x - h)2 + k, where (h,k) is the vertex and "a" is the value that tells whether the graph opens up or down, and how wide or narrow it is.     The vertex is at (-1,-2), and the graph opens up because "a" is positive.  That means the minimum y value of f(x) = -2 at the vertex (-1,-2). The axis of symmetry is the vertical line at x = -1, which is always at the x coordinate of the vertex. Since the graph is symmetric on each side of the axis of symmetry, the graph goes up from the vertex by the same amount on each side. It goes through the points:    (-2,-1) and (0,-1)  (-3,2) and (1,2)  (-4,7) and (2,7)  (-5,14) and (3,14)    This graph continues on up in a widening U shape forever, so there is no maximum value.     Its domain is all real numbers and its range is y  -2.    I hope that helps!! :-)

Plasmids can be taken up by an organism, at which point that organism will transcribe and translate the genetic code on the plasmid into proteins.  If you have a plasmid which gives an organism resistance to ampicillin, that organism would not grow on a media containing ampicillin unless it had taken up that plasmid.  Therefore, any colonies will represent plasmid positive cells.

AA10927246	You have two known points:  (100%, 44)  and  (75%, 40)    If you think of these as (x, y) coordinates, you have two points on a line.  First find the slope of the line.    m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1)  m = (44 - 40) / (100 - 75)  m = 4 / 25    In other words, the result changes 4 units for each change of 25 units in the percent.    From that you can start writing an equation:    y = mx + b  y = (4/25)x + b    Okay, but what is b?    Here you plug one of your points back in again (100, 44) --> x = 100, y = 44:  44 = (4/25)100 + b  44 = 4(100/25) + b  44 = 4(4) + b  44 = 16 + b  b = 44 - 16  b = 28    The final formula is:  y = (4/25)x + 28    Or as decimals:  y = 0.16x + 28    Let's solve this equation for x:  0.16x = y - 28  x = (y - 28) / 0.16    Now plug in your value of y = 42.7:  x = (42.7 - 28) / 0.16  x = 14.7/0.16  x = 91.875%    Formula --> x = (42.7 - 28) / 0.16  Answer --> x = 91.875%    Perhaps an easier way to see this is:  The percent ranges from 75% to 100% --> 25%  The score ranges from 40 to 44 --> 4 units    If the score goes up 2.7 units, how much will the percent go up?  Let's call the increase P:    Using ratios:  2.7 is to 4 as P is to 25%    2.7/4 = P/25    Cross multiply:  4P = 25 * 2.7  4P = 67.5  P = 67.5 / 4  P = 16.875%    Add this to 75% to get the answer:    X = 75 + 16.875  X = 91.875%|`|d504fb438e337821573b41867430f71daa	take 42.7 divided by 44    that is X    X=97 percent (about)|`|h9xKfbVKaa	100/44= 2.27273  2.27273 times 42.7= 97.04557    X%= 97.04557%

So in general, for a weak acid of known Ka,  [H+] = [Ka*c],  where c is the concentration of the weak acid. Formic acid is just about the strongest acid where we can get away with this shortcut, any stronger (larger Ka) and it's more accurate to rearrange the initial E line substitution into a quadratic.

gZPxJpSVaa	Since the number of girls stays the same, and we can't have a fraction  of a person, the number of girls must be divisible by both 3 and 5,  the numerators of the fractional values of girls.  The number of girls  must be a multiple of 15, and the only multiple of 15 in the given  range of girls is 30, so originally the club had 30 girls & 10 boys.  Two more boys joined, making the total 42 members, of which 30  are girls, which is 5/7 of the total now.  So now the drama club has 42 members, 30 girls and 12 boys.

Let x represent the width and y represent the length. So now the perimeter of the rectangle will be all the sides added together. So the two widths and two lengths are added together to 72 cm.    2x + 2y = 72    Now that you have the perimeter equation, you need to know the ratio of the length and the width. You said that the length is twice as long as the width. So two widths equal the length.    y = 2x    Now that you have two equations, you can solve for the length and width.    y = 2x  2x + 2y = 72    So substitute it in.    2x + 2(2x) = 72  2x + 4x = 72  6x = 72  x = 12 cm    So the width is 12 cm.    What about the length?  The length is twice as long as the width.    y = 2x    Now that you know the width you can substitute it in to the above equation to solve for the length.    y = 2(12)  y = 24 cm    Therefore the length of the rectangle is 24 cm and the width of the rectangle is 12 cm.|`|72EZj7OTaa	I have my own homework to do..but its done already(: I'm not going to sit here and do yours...and yeah i am gunna waste my time saying this...cuz i have the time..unlike someone whos a mister LAZY pants!!!!! do your own homework!|`|859f648d165965de3a9ed92f5090ca4eaa	2w+4(2l)=72  6l=72  l=12  w=24

If not the pig would probably die from the bite, so either way the pig would end up dead. I think during Shark Week of 2008, there was a program that showed people throwing in whole turkey and ham.

ilTCDOpIaa	There is no "ready to use" formula to find the area. That means you should do your own.   Since we don't have any given, I would do the following steps :    - Draw a line from each centers of the circles to join them together. You will have a scalene triangle if the radius of the circles are not the same. Each side of the triangle is the sum of two different radius. The idea is to find the area of the triangle minus the area of the three sectors of the circles inscribed in the triangles ;    - Use the law of cosines to find one angle ;     a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc*cosA     AngleA = Arccos((b^2 + c^2 - a^2)/2bc)    where a is the opposite side of angleA, b for angle B and c for angleC ;    - Use the following formula to find the area of the triangle :    Area = bc(sinA/2)    - From the area of the triangle, substract the area of the three sectors of the circles inscribed in the triangle as follow :    Area of sector of circle A = pi*r^2*angleA/360    and the same for circle B and circle C.

3c5f2316d7b180d5f45a6448d9b9def0aa	Glycolysis is the sequence of reactions that converts glucose into pyruvate with the concomitant production of a relatively small amount of ATP.   Glycolysis can be carried out anerobically (in the absence of oxygen) and is thus an especially important pathway for organisms that can ferment sugars.   For example, glycolysis is the pathway utilized by yeast to produce the alcohol found in beer.   Glycolysis also serves as a source of raw materials for the synthesis of other compounds.   For example, 3 phosphoglycerate can be converted into serine, while pyruvate can be aerobically degraded by the Krebs or TCA cycle to produce much larger amounts of ATP.     Pyruvate:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyruvate_ki...|`|Gdcc62cZaa	It is the result of the most common pathway for Glucose degradation. For every one glucose molecule it can be broken down into two pyruvate molecules/pyruvic acid via the Glycolytic Pathway.     Short Overview:     1) Glucose converts to Glyceraldehyde-3-P and Dihydroxyacetone phosphate USING 2 ATP along the way.    2) Those break down further to pyruvic acid/pyruvate, PRODUCING 10 ATP along the way for a TOTAL (8) ATP    A lot of major steps were skipped but that is a easy as it gets w/o getting too confusing. These are the steps of Glycolysis.|`|rdENr9BWaa	Basically what happens in glycolysis is glucose, a six-carbon sugar, is broken down into two three-carbon sugars (pyruvate is the final product).  Along the way, two molecules known as ATP (used for energy within the body) are produced.  Also, hydrogen is released and carried to the electron transport chain, which produces many more ATP.  Pyruvate goes through another cycle producing more ATP and hydrogen for the electron transport chain, and as it's broken down carbon dioxide is released.|`|GueE0to5aa	First link in google says Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway to convert glucose into pyruvate.    Pyruvate, also the first link in google says it is an acid used in biochemical reactions. "Pyruvic acid is a colorless liquid with a smell similar to that of acetic acid. It is miscible with water, and soluble in ethanol and diethyl ether."

yxnUBSJqaa	You need to tell people if its just a theory problem where you're trying to figure out how to use resistors or if you actually want to use it on a CD player.  Everybody else that answered is correct.  You can't use resistors on the real thing.  The power drain is not constant.    Instead of using a resistor, look for online electronics parts and find yourself an AC to DC transformer that supplies the 9VDC I'm assuming you need.  You still need to know the minimum and maximum current drain, even if you go that route...|`|X8LNbaKQaa	It is a poor way to reduce the 12 volt supply to 9 volt.  If the player had a constant current consumption, a single series resistor that wasted 3 volts at that current is all you would need.  But the player almost certainly uses different current depending on the volume setting and whether the motor is running faster or slower or starting or stopped.    Using two resistors in a voltage divider (what your question asks about works a little better by consuming current, itself, so reducing the voltage swing caused by a given current variation through the player.  But itr also dumps power, constantly and produces heat.    Besides, I don't know what even the average current requirement of the player is, let along the maximum or minimum.    Better would be a device that changes its resistance with current through it so that it wastes almost the same voltage over a wide range of current.  A zener diode connected with the cathode end (the banded end) to the +12 and the other end supplying ~9 volts to the player will waste almost a constant voltage even though the current through it is not constant.  Standard voltage ratings are 2.7 volts and 3.3 volts.    See:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_diode  http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/BZ/BZX85...    Better still is an integrated voltage regulator.  There are adjustable ones you program with a pair of resistors in a voltage divider, or fixed output ones that have this setting divider built in.  http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/LM/LM317...  http://www.fairchildsemi.com/ds/LM/LM780...    --   Regards,    John Popelish    P.S.  There is a beginner's electronics discussion group in Yahoo where you can get lots of hand holding.  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Electronic...|`|sRl3pWG8aa	You need to know what current the CD player needs.    Regardless, it is a very poor way to obtain the required voltage drop.|`|8f1645b57626d40f1d90691f3e9c2772aa	Practically speaking, there is no solution with those 2 resistors.  Because the load varies from the CD player you will need another method.    The most efficient would be a switch type power supply called a "buck converter".  You would get in the eighties percent range and for 1 amp could use a device that has an internal power switch.    Coming in at 75% efficiency would be a linear regulator.  There are probably single device solutions like a LM7809, or LM7808 with a couple of diode drops on the ground terminal.|`|da272101b7893568698b361994ea9699aa	Maybe what you're thinking is voltage divider, right? In theory, considering a very small or negligible load current, you can get 9V out of 12V supply just by voltage divider.....   9V=(12*R2)/(R1+R2) ; just decide for a fix R1 or R2 values then solve for the unkown resistor value......    unfortunately, this can't be possible if you have a significant changing/varying load current like CD players.... If you want to get a 9V from 12V supply for your CD player, then, make a voltage regulator.... you can choose a lot of them, most circuits available in the internet, from a very simple one to a complicated one.....

zYQFpJWNaa	if you understand the principle of the Coriolis effect, you'd see that the effect would be very VERY slight.<br>  <br>  The principle is simple. You begin at some radius from the axis of the earth, and due to the rotation of the earth, you are moving tangentially to that circle at some speed. If you begin, say, at the equator, then you would be moving at roughly 1000 miles an hour due east. <br>  <br>  If you move up into the air, or down into the ground, the radius changes, and so while YOU would still be moving at 1000 miles an hour, whatever was around you would be moving faster if you went up (larger radius), and slower if you went down (smaller radius). So you would move up and west relative to everything else, or down and east.<br>  <br>  If you move north or south along the surface of the Earth, towards one or the other pole, you would  also be getting slightly nearer to the earths axis, so the radius would be smaller, and the speed of everything else  will be less, and so you would, in both cases, move east.<br>  <br>  Back to the bullet: since it would only traverse a very small arc on the  surface of the planet, it's east/west speed would not change very much at all, especially as, since it is moving quickly, any small speed difference would not have much time to translate to distance.

kep1iGHpaa	I'm not going to do the math because I'm lazy but I'll tell you how to do it.  1) figure out how many new servers you need to accommodate how many  hits your getting at the moment.  2)then you need to figure out how many new servers you need to buy each month to accommodate the increase in hits.    Using a proportional equation means to set up the equation like     how many hits your server can take / over one second  is equal to  hits your getting per second / over one second  (Setting a problem up like that, X over P is equal to W over N is called a proportional equation.)    that way the denominators [bottom numbers] are equal.  Do that to help you understand what your dealing with    But you need to figure out how many people your not accommodating     How many hits you get minus how many you can accommodate = X   Now take X and divide it by how many people each new server can take which will = N    Your company now needs to buy N    Since you get 2500 additional hits each month, W, your company needs to buy W each month.    If you need to show your work just do all this on the paper or find a way to use a proportion equation. The way I think I don't use them to figure out this kind of problem. I doubt your teacher will mark you wrong for finding out the answer and doing it in the right way, whether you use the proportion or not the math you do on the paper still gives the right answer every time.|`|WG4zNIlTaa	The answer is 5.|`|0oOquvruaa	hmmmmm boba|`|IJTcXbvdaa	re5443543543543543|`|RVVctVFVaa	I don't think anyone is going to help you cheat.

hHVMrnK3aa	It means that the 40 questions are ranked by score.  First the ones you got right (2 points),  then the ones you got wrong (1 point),  then the ones you didn't answer (0 points).    Then the  bottom 10 are dropped, and the overall mark is based on the remaining 30.    Suppose you got 21 right, 14 wrong, and didn't answer 5.  The raw score is 42 + 14 = 56/80 or 70%.    The 5 no-answer's and 5 of the wrong answers would be tossed out,  leaving you with 21 right (x 2), 9 wrong (x 1) and overall score of  51 out of 60 possible or 85%.

rdENr9BWaa	The previous answers are both correct, but only part of the story.      Proteins are synthesized by combining specific amino acids in sequence determined by DNA.  There are some amino acids that the human body is incapable of producing itself, but there are also many elements required to synthesize amino acids that the body requires from other sources.  Sulfur and nitrogen are two common elements found in amino acids that the body can't obtain other than by consuming food.  Meat has extremely high levels of proteins, meaning there are lots of amino acids and elements available.  Amino acids can also be obtained from plants, but they aren't in as high concentration because meat (muscle tissue) is basically just protein molecules.|`|yrEuZXSOaa	You are right: humans can make proteins (using transcription and translation); however, we need to eat proteins for the amino acids, that the tRNAs use to create proteins.|`|6zr8aRUdaa	Humans don't have all 20 amino acids.

AA10929714	First, put the equations into standard form, which is:    y' + a(x)*y = f(x)    The integrating factor, p(x), is then given by:    p(x) = exp(INTEGRAL of {a(x) dx})    and the solution is then given by:    y(x) = (1/p(x))*INTEGRAL of {p(x) * f(x) dx}    For  1, the standard form would be:    y' - y = exp(2x) - 1    so a(x) = -1 and f(x) = exp(2x) -1    p(x) = exp(INTEGRAL of { -1 dx})     p(x) = exp(-x)    y(x) = exp(x)*INTEGRAL of {exp(-x)*(exp(2x) - 1) dx}    y(x) = exp(x)*INTEGRAL of {(exp(x) - exp(-x)) dx}    y(x) = exp(x) * [exp(x) + exp(-x) + c]    where c is a constant of integration.    y(x) = exp(2x) + 1 + c*exp(x)  ---------    For   2, it's easier to solve this for x in terms of y, rather than the other way around.  We have:    dx = (sin(y) - x/y) dy    dx/dy = sin(y) - x/y    x' + (1/y)*x = sin(y)    so a(y) = 1/y and f(y) = sin(y)    The integrating factor is then:    p(y) = exp(INTEGRAL of {1/y dy})    p(y) = exp(ln(y)) = y    x(y) = (1/y)*INTEGRAL of {y*sin(y) dy}    Integrate by parts to get:    x(y) = (1/y)*[sin(y) - y*cos(y) + c]    x(y) = (sin(y))/y - cos(y) + c/y

This is also called the set of numbers for which this function is defined.    y= sqrt x-3     So plug in any number that gives you an answer that is not impossible  In this function there is no square roots of a negative number, so your domain will be all real numbers except those which make a negative square root for y.

gCn6bXAFaa	"Here's how some scientists think some eyes may have evolved: The simple light-sensitive spot on the skin of some ancestral creature gave it some tiny survival advantage, perhaps allowing it to evade a predator. Random changes then created a depression in the light-sensitive patch, a deepening pit that made "vision" a little sharper. At the same time, the pit's opening gradually narrowed, so light entered through a small aperture, like a pinhole camera.     Every change had to confer a survival advantage, no matter how slight. Eventually, the light-sensitive spot evolved into a retina, the layer of cells and pigment at the back of the human eye. Over time a lens formed at the front of the eye. It could have arisen as a double-layered transparent tissue containing increasing amounts of liquid that gave it the convex curvature of the human eye.     In fact, eyes corresponding to every stage in this sequence have been found in existing living species. The existence of this range of less complex light-sensitive structures supports scientists' hypotheses about how complex eyes like ours could evolve. The first animals with anything resembling an eye lived about 550 million years ago. And, according to one scientist's calculations, only 364,000 years would have been needed for a camera-like eye to evolve from a light-sensitive patch."    plagiarized!|`|5uFXCBpraa	Ants have simple eyes that can only detect light and dark -- they can't actually see anything.    Water fleas have an interesting microscopic eye -- you can easily imagine that thing evolving.  The human eye has a different (and more complex) structure, though.  Try imagining a microscopic cavity with the light sensor in the back.

They still have organelles for sure though so please please please do not listen to that guys comment. All the organelles well known to man that are contained commonly in any prokaryote are the: Ribosomes, DNA, RNA.

cbPqCpWOaa	Take a close look at each statement.  First statement: a/b =3. That just means that a is 3 times what b is. So if a is 6, then b is 2. if a is 3, b is 1.  Second statement: b/c = 7. That just means that b is 7 times c.    So let's say c is 1. Then, b is 7. If b is 7, then we know that a is 21 (because it's 3 times what b is).  So, (a+b)/(b + c) is (21+7)/(7 + 1).

From a/b=3, we can multiply by b to get a=3b  From b/c=7, we can multiply by c to get b=7c  Also, we can combine those two to get a=3(7c) or a=21c  Now, replace all the variables to get only c's  You get (21c+7c)/(7c+c) which simplified is 28/8 or 7/2|`|qvVfIrhDaa	It's a logic question.

The new strands begin to be made here, and the bubble gets bigger and bigger as the replication goes in both directions (like if you pull Twizzlers apart from the middle until they separate at the ends).  Since it goes in both directions at the same time (and in some cells several bubbles can go at one time), replication is much faster than if it just went all the way down from one end to the other.|`|SgAYfsaRaa	Doing Homework on here?

z8xYANiJaa	So that the question doesn't go to waste, here's a solution:    ?f/?x means that y is a constant, so for the sake of clarity, I'll use k instead of y to make it explicit.    f(x) = (1 - x2 + k2)    Now we differentiate as if it were a single variable function:    f'(x) = 1/[2(1 - x2 + k2)] ? -2x  f'(x) = -x/(1 - x2 + k2)    Lets replace k with the y again and using proper notation we'd have:    ?f/?x = -x/(1 - x2 + y2)    Hope this helps!

g5M5Ivhgaa	Density is the grams per cm^3    Since you already have the grams, the only part missing is the cm^3    When the experimentor took away the substance, he or she can only fill the empty volume with the exact same volume of mercury.  when filled, it weighed 124g less.  so that means that the mercury that filled it weighed 241g - 124g = 117g    once you have that, solve for the volume    (1cm^3)/(13.6g) * 117g    8.60cm^3    now that you have the volume, just divide since the volume taken out must be the same as the volume placed back inside    (241g)/(8.60cm^3)    28.0g/cm^3

To do this, use parts:    u = ln x, du = dx/x  dv = dx/x^2, du = -1/x    You get:    int(1,infinit,(lnx/x^2)dx) = [-lnx/x from 1 to infinity]+int(1,infinity,dx/x^2)    The integral on the right converges--we know int(1,infinity,dx/x^p) converges whenever p > 1--and the other term on the right is finite.  To see this, use l'H?pital's rule to show that:    lim_{x->infinity} lnx/x = 0

xpyQZba7aa	The percentage comp can tell you the ratio of atoms in the molecule. But it cannot tell you exactly how many of each atom are in the molecule, only their ratio to each other    For example:     25 % H; 75 % C  Since it is a percentage, assume you have 100 g    So 25 g H  75 g C    moles = mass / molar mass  moles H = 25 g / 1g/mol = 25 moles  moles C = 75 g / 12 g/mol = 6.25 mol    ratio C : H  6.25 : 25    Divide by smallest number  6.25 / 6.25 : 25/6.25  = 1 : 4    This gives the empirical formula (simplest ratio of atoms in the molecule)  CH4 - methane    Now, lets look at ethane, which has the same ratio of C : H  C2H8 - ethane    The percentage of C in ethane is  24 g / 32 g x 100/1  = 75 %    The % H in ethane  8 g / 32 g x100/1  = 25 %    Which is the same composition as the CH4. we can't tell if it is one or the other from % comp alone.

i0ypGmlQaa	Start with the low possibilities and break down the number.    It's not even, so you can't divide by 2.    You can divide by 3 though. The test for that is to (repeatedly) sum the digits. If the final outcome is divisible by 3, then the original number was. Try that:    2 + 1 + 8 + 3 + 1 = 15  1 + 5 = 6 [yes!]    So divide it by 3:    21831 / 3 = 7277    Here is where it gets to be pretty much guess-and-check.    It's not even, nor divisible by 5. The test for divisibility by 3 fails:    7 + 2 + 7 + 7 = 23  2+5 = 7 [no!]    So what about 11? 11 is the same trick, except you add/subtract the digits (in backwards order):    7 - 7 + 2 - 7 = -5 (not divisible by 11)    Now, what else do we have to test? We only need to go as high as 7277 because if we haven't found a factor by then, there can't be any factors -- two factors higher than that would multiply to get you higher than 7277:    a > 7277  b > 7277  ab > 7277    So what is that? 7277 =  85.3053339    It's also not divisible by 7, we can figure that out just based on the digits (if it were, 200 would be divisible by 7, but 200 is not). only have to check primes of course. The primes to check (that we haven't yet checked) are: 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, ...    I won't list them. You should just start checking. You will find only on your third try that it's divisible by:    7277 / 19 = 383    From there, we already know 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19. And now we only have to check up to:    383 = 19.5    OH NO. That's too small. We've already checked all the candidates. We need to re-check 19 to make sure it's not still there, but it's not. So 383 is the biggest.

He2WsvBcaa	b. greater than the energy stored in the bonds of the products  Why?  Because when a chemical bond is formed, the resulting compound has less potential energy than the substances from which it was formed. Energy is always released when a bond is formed. The greater the energy released during the formation of a bond, the greater its stability. Consider the following reaction:  B + C ==> BC + 100 joules  The bond formed has less energy than the reactants because it released energy to form the resulting compound.    Exothermic means energy is being released. More energy is stored in the reactants, because that energy was released to form the compound.

1Q9ldcWSaa	1.  Find all the prime factors of each denominator.  2.  Using information from part 1, find the least common multiple of each denominator.  That gives you the least common denominator.    Example:    3/16 - 5/24    1.  Find all the prime factors of each denominator.      16 = 2^4  24 = 2^3*3    2.  Using information from part 1, find the least common multiple of each denominator.  That gives you the least common denominator.    The highest power of 2 is 2^4.  The highest power of 3 is 3.  Therefore, the least common multiple of 16 and 24 is 2^4*3 = 16*3 = 48.  Therefore, the least common denominator is 48.

GWP measures how much heat one molecule of a gas will trap relative to a molecule of carbon dioxide.     Methane has a GWP of 21, which means it's 21 times more effective at preventing infrared radiation from escaping the planet.     So, although methane emissions may be relatively piddling, they're definitely a cause for concern. (Their one saving grace is an atmospheric lifetime of just 12 years, versus between 50 and 200 years for carbon dioxide.)    As with many of its fellow greenhouse gases, methane has become far more prevalent in the Earth's atmosphere since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution.     By analyzing the chemical composition of air bubbles trapped in ice sheets, scientists have estimated that the atmospheric concentration of methane has increased by 150 percent since the mid-1700s; over that same time period, the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen by "just" 35 percent.
wBbasieQaa	To find the perpendicular line you'll need the slope of the tangent.    y = x^2 + 6x + 4  dy/dx = 2x + 6 = 2(-2) + 6 = 2    Since the tangent slope is 2 at the point (-2,-4), the perpendicular line has a slope of -1/2.    y = -x/2 + b  -4 = -(-2)/2 + b  -4 = 1 + b  b = -5  y = -x/2 - 5    That's the perpendicular line.    y = -x/2 - 5  y = x^2 + 6x + 4  -x/2 - 5 = x^2 + 6x + 4  -x - 10 = 2x^2 + 12x + 8  2x^2 + 13x + 18 = 0  (2x+9)(x+2) = 0    Since the intersection at x=-2 is already known, the other point is at 2x+9=0, or x=-9/2.    y = -(-9/2)/2 - 5 = 9/4 - 5 = -11/4    The other point is (-9/2,-11/4).

Therefore any even number squared results in an even result.    So if you square m and get an odd integer, you must have started with an odd integer m.

i0ypGmlQaa	The projection of u onto v is:    (u?v) v / |v|2    u? v tells you how much of u is in the v direction.    v / |v|2 is the unit vector in the v direction.    [Originally, when I wrote this down I neglected the 2 and of course, worked the problem that way. See below for a note about the correction. What follows includes the error.]    Hence that's what you want to calculate:    u?v = (-3)(-1) + (-8)(2) = 3 - 16 = -13    |v| = ( (-1)2 + 22) = 5    So that is going to be:    (u?v) v / |v| = (-13/5)  =     Then you just use what's "left over" from u, which is:    u - (u?v) v / |v|  =  -  =   ? ? ?     That's it. In the direction of v, you have:  ? ? ?   orthogonal to v, you have:  ? ? ?     The other person is correct. I am bad with typos. Why they didn't bother to (1) write out their own solution instead of copying mine or (2) have the courtesy to message me in private so I could fix my own typos... I will never comprehend such an act. Why I have also received a thumbs down... well that is just pathetic. Change 5 to 5 in every formula. That's the minor typo correction. Answer becomes:    In the direction of v, you have:  ? ? ?   orthogonal to v, you have:  ? ? ?  = |`|D0znfBeXaa	cheeser1, the vectors you got are not even orthogonal!    Nevertheless the method is correct and just one mistake in the first formula has spoiled everything:    The projection of u onto v is:    (u?v0) v0 = (u?v) v/|v|2    u? v0 tells you how much of u is in the v direction,    v0 - unit vector in the direction of v.    Hence the answer  is  a = (13/5 ; -26/5)  in the direction of v;  b = (-28/5; -14/5) orthogonal to v.

t5Nrj6Txaa	I started a writing a textbook to accomplish this goal, but I began to realize that no one would be interested . . . because it's not easy.  If you are really intent on pursuing this goal, start reading a good calculus text and a good physics text simultaneously.  This will be all you need to be on your way.  The first problem is that real college level textbooks are not cheap--you'll likely find them for $90 in used condition.  Here are some examples:    http://www.amazon.com/Physics-Principles...    http://www.amazon.com/Calculus-Analytic-...    If you can find these at a library (most likely a university library) that would probably be the way to go.    Otherwise, Dover publishes a lot of old titles that will be slightly dated, but much more affordable, such as:    http://www.amazon.com/Theoretical-Physic...    The book by Joos also, very briefly, covers the elements of calculus necessary for the material.  It is a great deal for the money.    Otherwise, if you want something easy, popular literature will be the best way to go, something like    http://www.amazon.com/Dancing-Wu-Li-Mast...    can give you a taste of the field.    Work hard, and good luck!|`|2q8kXR8Vaa	Hi!    Your question brings back the memories... namely: me, a dozen-odd years ago! Physics is a lot of fun and I strongly approve of your goal. I will warn you however that this task (ie, learning Physics) can be frustrating, especially if you happen to believe you don't like math... Math is more than just calculations- for physicists, it becomes a language- more even- a way of seeing, a world-view! Your progress in physics will largely be determined by how much math you know at any given point. So I guess before recommending any particular course of study, I'd have to ask you what level you are at and what you have studied so far. BTW, besides re-posting on here, feel free to drop me an email: rjtucke AT gmail DOT com. (I don't use my yahoo mail account much.)    (By the way, as for my credentials- although I feel quite comfortable calling myself a Physics-guy, I am still on The Path myself; I have earned my college degree (Bachelor of Science) in it, but don't have my PhD, which is usually the 'ticket' to being a full-fledged "physicist"...)|`|VKLoX2Lzaa	I am about were you are, but I only have learned a lot already. The best thing to do right now, is not to study, I'm taking a wild guess that you aren't too old. But to just think about things. And a method of doing this, I strongly recommend, is to view the Physics for Future Presidents lectures for free by Richard A. Muller. Its him teaching a live class and recording it. He is almost perfect for beginners because he only does conceptual physics. Not so much math, so you can understand the physics before you study it. This has given me an awesome advantage. Even though I only started to really like physics about 2 years ago, I'm already able to slowly study classical mechanics. Considering I'm not particularly fluent in math in any form other then basic skills for it. I do understand it easily, even though it takes me a while to really understand a problem once I do It gets just that much easier. After I watched the history channel, the science channel, and Richards lectures for a while, and looking on the internet at physicsworld.com and anything I could find on google. And answering physics questions on this site. I decided to buy a book on physics and decided to get classical mechanics. I believe that is one of the most basic things you need to know in physics. How things move. After that I really don't know where I'm going with it. I'm thinking about physics simulations, or some other field in the area of programming, which I will be going to college for. I'm probably going to work as a programmer but study as a physicist for my whole till I can actually call my self a physicist. I would suggest something like that but changed for your situation and direction.

Every chemical reaction is an insanely complex process. When you chew on something the enzymes in your saliva reacts with the food, converting the taste into neuro-signals and producing responses. All this is done through chemical reactions. When you breathe, sit or move even, chemical reactions are producing those actions. Chemistry is everywhere. If you still thing you need to do simple chemical reactions, try burning sugar to produce water and CO2. Try mixing sodium bicarbonate and acetic acid which is basically baking soda and vinegar. We give these everyday reactions awesome names and make them sound so complicated but remember this. Everything around you is Chemistry!!!! nothing exists outside of it!
