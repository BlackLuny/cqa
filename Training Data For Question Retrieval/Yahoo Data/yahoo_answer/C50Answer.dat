CNSGz12zaa	Norm Coleman is delusional and I am not surprised by his statements, I am surprised he didn't declare himself the new ex-Jewish Messiah! He seems to think that he and he alone is fit to represent his state. The people of Minnesota have no right to vote for anyone but Norm. He cannot fathom losing which he has and that the people were just wrong in their votes for Franken. He is as bad as Roland Burris, neither of the two are fit for the Senate and they should both just go away. Imagine someone with such an Ego that he thinks God chose him! What a joke the guy has become.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	God is still pissed at Coleman for abandoning the Jewish faith and becoming Catholic. Why do you think he lost to another Jew?<br>  <br>  Coleman is a useless worm and has never represented Minnesota, he always just represented himself. He only got into the Senate by taking advantage of the tragic death of Paul Wellstone.|`|aGNjZmyJaa	Notice how the Republicans stay away from this question because it exposes their flawed ideology on God. lol|`|YIWKPXokaa	No<br>  <br>  That is just crazy.|`|h9Q9fJOaaa	He's just pissed that he lost to a comedian.  God told George Bush to run too and we see how great that turned out.  A politician saying God told them to do something should be held on the same standard that we hold serial killers when they say that God told them to do it.  What I'm trying to say...don't believe them.  If God wanted him there, then he would have gotten enough people to vote for him in the first place.|`|V44ARW4maa	the problem with norm coleman is he actually believes he knows what God wants. In reality, norm will soon join rove, cheney, bush, gonzales mccain, palin , limpballs, hannity and joe the plumber in the growing line of worthless sewage.|`|VsaEOX9vaa	It's just BS!

t3QAaSN9aa	We certainly knew that we had sold WMDs to Iraq.  The question in 2002-2003 was whether Iraq still had WMDs.  <br>  <br>  The UN inspectors were in Iraq looking for them in March 2003 and they weren't finding any.  They nevertheless had to leave because Bush was determined to invade Iraq. The UN inspectors should have been allowed to finish their inspections.|`|5rXzu0IWaa	Could it be that George the Chimp told them that and made it sound like he had some secret information to back it?<br>  <br>  I read today that he is suicidal and that his wife is going to write a tell all book outing him.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Because Democrats are chimps.<br>  <br>  They voted for War.<br>  <br>  Then they Betrayed us and supported the enemy.<br>  <br>  They did the same thing during Nam.<br>  <br>  Democrats are phony hypocrites.|`|B6c7BeDnaa	because clinton said the same thing.even saddam bragged about it and threatened to use them.|`|um87XJvmaa	Because that was what they were told and they were too lazy to find out or think it out on their own.<br>  <br>  Add:  I agree with Tribeca.   Yes, there were WMD at one time, but not when we were told.|`|19L99wvCaa	Bush told us there were. Once the US invaded and none were found, we were pretty ticked off that he lied to everyone.|`|X9VDzvo4aa	I thought that way because I couldn't put it together in my head that the President would lie right to my face(through the TV).  I was never a Bush fan but I couldn't believe that after 9/11 a president could start a war that wasn't necessary.  Turns out I was wrong.|`|nz8U5rNaaa	Because he did have WMD's we saw them during the Persian Gulf War. So Clinton certainly knows he had them. Now people won't admit that they were there and were smuggled out of the country like their generals tell us they did, but that is not good enough for a liberal.|`|58pYf74Vaa	I don't know.

Please, honor him.|`|c3vPZfghaa	uneducated people think Hitler did not give lip-service to the people of faith to gain their support.<br>  They think he didn't inspire blind patriotism and nationalism to gain support.<br>  They think the Nazi party was composed of a bunch of socialists, rather than a bunch of rich elitist business owners.<br>  For some reason they also think Italian fascism is socialism rather than the rich and large corporations driving government policy.<br>  because of talk radio misinformation, they think elitists are arrogant liberals rather than people who think the rich and big businesses should drive government policy.<br>  They also don't realize Hitler was anti-liberal.<br>  <br>  Must be from the schools where children were left behind.|`|KcAehrrKaa	If they do, it is false.

Hitler did that too.|`|Nejnh1Bqaa	I would hesitate to compare anyone to that failed artist from Austria, whose name will not be mentioned.

Hitler was a (I believe the term is) Megalomaniac. I think Pres. Obama has his own agenda but basically I believe he has the best interests of the country at heart. I just think he has been listening to the wrong people when it comes to setting policy.

That is why all the human rights issues, fair trade issue, job outsourcing issues, currench exchange issue, ... have become much less important comparing to the issue of borrowing money from Uncle Communist.|`|1hOTlMvaaa	Yes, and I suspect that Bush somehow made out or he purposely had motive of destroying this nation as well as problems around the globe|`|6cd7cae3f8d44a82dd6c9bf47a165cd6aa	No she makes friends and money by trading in national secrets and technology.

AA11001708	Why unpatriotic. No, perhaps a bit naive and at the peril of even being called stupid, but not unpatriotic.   One needs to step onto the stage of policy  sometime and even in an engagement with no particular expertise, one learns from being cut off, cut down and sent back to his corner wounded.   For the next time you can take on an issue after you have prepared yourself for the fight!.  <br>  <br>  Actually one could be called unpatriotic for not addressing issues, policies that concern us all.

WKBK4BI8aa	I know a few, and I would say that you really need to push yourself. From listening to a S.E.A.L., I'd say:<br>  <br>  By cardio, you need to do roughly 10 miles a day, as if you were training for a marathon.<br>  <br>  By weights, I'd say just train train train.<br>  <br>  Also don't just stick to a gym for excercise and fitness. If you think you'd be running around or swimming long distances or something, then do those things.<br>  <br>  The best advice I can give you is: train like you'd fight, so you fight like you'd train.|`|29izngqXaa	Don't worry about weight liftinf its more of how you can push your body through situps, chinups, and push ups. Do a good amout of cardio daily like a twice a day or something related to track or cross country at school. Find a swim team to teach you the proper way of swimming and try to learn the combat stroke. All of this will help you with the PST and BUD/s also SEALS are the top of the top so not ever one is capable of doing it less then 1 percent of The United States meet the requirements for the PST.|`|8KxNa0eVaa	Like the first answerer said, A LOT of cardio.  Push yourself harder than you knew you could.  Might I recommend a DVD.  It is called SEAL Fit.  It walks you through the various exercises SEALs do, and it is all shot at real SEAL PT sessions and a SEAL instructor easily explains on how to perfectly do each exercise.  Good luck!|`|6PBGAp7Raa	read the book "lone survivor" by marcus lutrell or watch any of the stuff about the SEALs on the military channel and you will get a good idea. just lift and do alot of cardio. alot|`|V3rdxOOTaa	well basics just run 3 to 4 miles  do  like 200 push ups and eat healthy. pretty much it the rest of the special training they will teach you when you get in. but if your not even pyshicaly in shape theres no way in hell you could make it. It will be almost impossible.

It reminds of the Bush Policy of attacking countries that you think just might possibly be enemies. He thought it was the American responsibility to spread Democracy throughout the world.<br>  <br>  This was a good way for the rich to get richer and the poor to grow in huge numbers. As you can see, the United States has its hands full trying to police itself, let alone try to be the police force of the whole world.<br>  <br>  There have been times when we have gone out to help people in trouble, as in Kosovo. There have been other times, as in Africa, when we have sat back and did nothing.

MUkC93kUaa	My thoughts on it are this:  <br>  <br>  Those who are physically / mentally disabled, too ill to work, etc., do "deserve," as human beings, basic necessities -- and I look highly upon the organizations that work to ensure they have it.<br>  <br>  The same goes for children -- regardless of what their parents do, every child deserves clothing, warm shelter, nourishment, and a good education.  <br>  <br>  When it comes to people that are able to work but cannot find a job, I judge them on a case by case basis.  Some truly do look for work -- they ask friends, family, and anyone they come across.  They fill out application after application, and really do their best.  I don't mind if someone is doing the best they can, and still need assistance.<br>  <br>  It's those that could work, but don't.  I've seen people in new, high-end brand name clothing, driving expensive cars, with the newest everything, yet using food stamps for groceries simply because they don't want to have to work a little harder to make that extra money.  I have no sympathy for those that could support themselves, but don't.<br>  <br>  Similarly, someone who works at a minimum-wage job all their life, never even TRYING to move up, can fend for themselves, as far as I'm concerned.  I admit, there are exceptions -- but for the most part, I believe that those who are unhappy with their current position in life should look only toward themselves to improve it. <br>  <br>  It doesn't always take a college education -- I know someone who started out as a worker at McDonalds, who now owns two of the restaurants, herself --  she supports her family very well.  <br>  <br>  I don't like it when someone says they did not go to college because their parents could not afford it, or that they do not have much money because they didn't have any opportunities.  You have to FIND the opportunities.  Every day, someone new steps into the world of higher education with only themselves to look toward, and every day, they get a step closer to success.  <br>  <br>  Aside a few choice cases, anyone can be successful if THEY put an effort into it -- but looking towards others isn't going to get them far, and they shouldn't expect it to.|`|ed3479cd30aa26d0499c9236b905e198aa	I wasn't aware that the stimulus Package "included" a new big home, fast car, and vacation's for the unemployed!<br>  <br>  Thanks to the incompetent Bush's policies I have been out of work for almost a year!

He became a Republican when he ran for Governor of California against a popular Democratic opponent.  He was the head of a very Democratic Union at this time, the Screenwriter's Guild, a very large and very respected Union.<br>  <br>  Republicans always curse Hollywood, simply because most of Hollywood is Democratic. But they never fail to try to get a movie star to run for office.  Ronnie and Arnold are both examples of this. <br>  <br>  Reagan...and, I presume, Dole...never considered doing away with Social Security, which is a good program that protects our Elderly from complete poverty at the end of their lives.  The Social Security Fund is not a part of the General Fund, which is the budget for our country.  The Social Security Fund is separate from the budget, is compiled from contributions from all of the country's workers, and would be in no trouble at all if the various Congresses had not dipped into the fund to finance various projects.<br>  <br>  If they repay the money they have borrowed from the fund, there would be no shortfall at all.|`|aiyU3Qf9aa	According to the media of the time, he was a rabid, war-mongering, cowboy who was going to destroy the planet because he wouldn't accommodate the "reasonable needs" of the Soviet Union!|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Not unless Obama is a Rabid Communist.<br>  <br>  Oooops.

It was designed to be a personal savings account for each payor, so that at age 55 (now 65 and soon 70+) they would receive payments from the interest on that money and part of the principle to guarantee a certain level of income and standard of living to the payor in his/her retirement years.<br>  <br>  This would prevent a horrendous drain of crucial venture capital from the market in support of elderly relatives whose retirement funds couldn't carry them through tough times.<br>  <br>  It meant that poor young Hector Hadnapenny didn't have to mortgage his home to take care of old Aunt Fannie when Uncle Abner passed on and could no longer support her, and he could focus on building a level of family income that would allow him to be a stimulus to and not a leech upon the economy.<br>  <br>  It meant that instead of having to go sell half the company to bail out Grampa when his pension wasn't enough, Johnny the enterpreneur could get on about the business of growing his company and stimulating the economy (DOH! Did I say stimulate the economy? OOOH! I must be an Obamabot! No, this is actually the proper source of economic stimulation, not tax funds)<br>  <br>  The brilliant part of the plan is that it would leave a huge amount of money in each account at the passing of the payor, which could be used by his/her surviving relatives, and under the right of eschief, once there was no longer a familial call upon those funds, they would become part of the federal treasury, which, if left alone, would have grown into a means by which the government could have enhanced the interest paid on those Social Security Accounts.<br>  <br>  It was also a vehicle by which FDR hoped to forward the incremental descent of U.S. politics into a totalitarian socialst colony of the new world order's regional and global government. It provided public dependency upon government-administrated funds (which desensitized the public to the realities of the welfare state), made the government a big brother, opened the door for governmental intrusion into personal finance and established a number by which each person's records and opportunities could be controlled.<br>  <br>  It was rejected until long after FDR's death, and JFK insisted upon a provision that the SSAN would never be used for anything but adminstration of Social Security Acoount funds to the account OWNERS (That is why the designation was changed from Social Security Account Number / SSAN to Social Security Number / SSN).<br>  <br>  Democrats, though, love anything socialistic and communistic and strive to strip it of any semblance to capitalism. <br>  They balanced the expenses of all their gimmiegoodie programs against the Social Security trust accounts, but first they had to transform it from personal accounts into one giant slush fund. That is another part of why my original social security card said "Social Security Account Number." and pre-1980's tax forms asked for SSAN, not SSN.<br>  <br>  Reagan and Dole attempted unsuccessfully to return the Social Security funds to a personal account status and dismantle the growing, abusive and increasingly intrusive governmental and private misuse of the SSAN  (renamed SSN for this and worse purposes) , but the Demagogue National Carcass had screwed it up so badly that not only was there nothing there but IOUs but there was no hope of  repairing it in 12 years, much less the 8 golden years of Reagan's presidency.<br>  <br>  Thanks for pointing that out, though.<br>  <br>  I like to be reminded how good Reagan was, how bad democrats are and how gullible, ignorant, hypocritical and uneducated the bubble-gum pop culture really is.

Kennedy might have seemed liberal in his day, but if he were alive now, he would be seen as a moderate.  <br>  <br>  <br>  if you look back far enough you see that the political party lines have almost completely reversed from where they started in.  The entire south started as democrats, and those republicans up north were hated.  <br>  <br>  <br>  so as you can see we can't judge parties based on the past, we need to look at their actions today, and the democratic party is moving further left than ever, that is why people are saying all those things you listed above.|`|zftm6qkKaa	What is going on is the democrats want to make American life a level playing field for the middle class.

54504a97dd79a59f0b20d02a99e4afbaaa	Lola,<br>  The problem with pro-life campaigners is their apparent lack of humanity.<br>  <br>  I am not qualified to speak on the rights and wrongs of abortion, but it is in my own opinion morally wrong to allow a child to be born into a life of misery and pain, with no hope of a cure.<br>  <br>  I take the view that the Law Lords who recently refused a woman who is terminally ill an assurance that her partner would not be prosecuted if he assisted her to commit suicide, when her illness became too much for her to bear, revealed themselves to be self opinionated nincompoops in wigs.<br>  <br>  How dare they say that she must either kill herself while she still can, or choke to death.<br>  <br>  They are sick, sick, sick and who the hell gave them the power or the right to deny the woman the same rights as a dog?<br>  <br>  That's the probem with the pro-life brigade, they believe their opinions are not only the right ones but must be obeyed.<br>  <br>  My advice to the woman is this: Live as long as you can and allow your partner to assist you to die, and let's see if a jury would ever convict him?|`|LJkPRqN0aa	the only reason i think abortion is acceptable is in the case of rape, even then in the case of rape. the mother still has the choice to keep the baby or give it up for adoption incest, or the pregancy/ birth will kill or severely harm the baby or the mother. that does not make me pro choice. but i do see acceptions because in those situations the mother in question did not have the choice to have sex (rape) and in the death situation the mother has the right to choose life for herself. other than that i am 100% pro life. <br>  <br>  abortion is never acceptable in my eyes if the girl just got knocked up and was careless during sex. she made the choice to have sex and was careless so she and the father made the baby, they thought they were responsible enough to engage in sex so they should take responsibility and take care OR give the baby up for adoption to someone who will actually love the baby. and im sorry if you have had a bad experience but at least your mother and father cared enough about you to give you life and not kill you. think of that.....|`|W8aiAWe2aa	A woman that is raped should not be forced to have the baby as this could be very mentally damaging to the women. Yes it is not the baby's fault if she was raped but the interests of the women have to be taken on board.<br>  <br>  I am strongly opposed to women having terminations owing to not using contraception or it not working. Convenience terminations are not an option but are still (sadly) done.<br>  <br>  If a baby is going to be severely disabled and suffer then again i do not feel the mother should be forced to continue the pregnancy.|`|AA11995584	Abortion prior to Roe V Wade was allowed in cases of rape. I do not believe she should have to keep the baby, but why punish the child for a crime someone else committed. There are hundreds of people who would love a child but can not have one. It is still a life is it not?<br>  <br>  There are a number of tests preformed during pregnancy that give false results. I personally know 3 women who were told their child would be downs syndrome and when the baby was born it was fine. Who are you to decide the quality of life of another? If we could ask every child ever aborted if they wish they had been born, I bet it would be almost a 100% yes.<br>  <br>  I am sorry your experience has been less than perfect in your eyes. We have a friend that has adopted 4 children all from less than perfect situations, and of the 4 all but one were over 8 years old when they were adopted. Each one would tell you they love their life now as opposed to what it was.|`|ffJcrsmLaa	I think first-trimester abortions should be an option for victims of rape/incest. If the child will be in pain for his/her whole life and will die young, it is reasonable to say that it would be in the child's best interest to die painlessly. Note that the above two cases are extremely rare, so I still think abortion is wrong in the vast majority of cases.<br>  <br>  "I know that addoption is always an option but addoption isnt always a good path for some children. I was addopted so i know the system."<br>  <br>  So you are saying that you would rather have been aborted than still be alive now? Adoption (notice the spelling) may not be perfect, but it's surely a much better option than death.|`|dYQUQGflaa	I'm not "pro-life," I'm pro-choice, but I still think abortion is wrong.<br>  <br>  I don't think the government should get to make decisions for women though, it's their problem (or w/e you wanna call it) and it's up to them.<br>  <br>  I think abortion laws are bad anyway.  There was one that was going to be passed in my state in November and the way it was set up if a women was going to have twins and there were complications and the only way to save one of the twins was to abort the other, you couldn't do it and they would both die, and the mom could die too.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	1.

pcHp7Dgkaa	The fact that you have been working in Australia in a SOL occupation will help with your ACS skills assessment, but the skills assessment and the DIAC requirements are two separate things. DIAC say that you must have a positive skills assessment and that's the end of it - you will need the assessment for the points.<br>  <br>  The community language requirement is easier. The university at which she has done her master's has presumably already accepted her undergraduate degree as equivalent to an Australian degree. Submit the evidence as required and I believe it will be OK without skills assessment. You might find it useful to also attach something proving the equivalence. There are published charts which will show it if her original uni isn't too obscure or you could get a statement from her university. <br>  <br>  You could also go for state government sponsorship if your state is offering it for her occupation.

m5J36D28aa	They are actually nicknamed "titless WAFs" and their numbers were only enough to handle office tasks no more than in the other military branches.  I did aircraft avionics maintenance and spent half my time on the flight line working on aircraft and the other half in the shop repairing electronics inside black boxes.  My "chair" in the Air Force was often a cockpit seat in a F-4E or the navigators seat in the bottom of a B-52 while working on the Doppler or inertial navigation system.  In the shop, I didn't have a chair, I stood all of the time working on high benches to repair electronics.<br>  <br>  People who use the term Chair Force are only showing their gross ignorance and think you have to carry a gun to be a man.  If you knew anything at all about the Air Force, you would know their career field is an AFSC, not MOS.<br>  Many people I've known who carry guns are only looking for an extension for where they are insufficient.|`|4VzVfKvdaa	I sure am glad jg is there to carpet the beach with his body for me to walk on to my nice shiny desk so I can call his wife and tell her he's dead.

Working on the ramp in extremes of temperature for long hours with little reward, and dealing with PO'd fighter guys (like I was)  is not for the WD.<br>  The AF does have it share of admin, finance, base-operating support specialties, but so do the other services.  The AF also does its job ALL the time:  launching, recovering aircraft, and operations planning don't change from in-garrison to deployed environments.  This is very different from the Army and USMC who differentiate between garrison, and field duties.<br>  The Army likes to use that term, but keep in mind only 20% of the Army are in direct combat MOS's, the rest are combat support and combat service support.
4iJzH4klaa	Are you kidding me, you cant judge which party is more racist, they both have racist and not racist people in them, and just cause some one did not vote for obama does not mean you are automaticaly racist, it means either you dont belive in his views or you thought mccain would be a better president, which i agree with, The problem with obama actualy isent his fault, its the media, for starters they totaly gave him a free pass in the election race, they dident say crap about him for fear of being called racist, no and after he was elected, they praised him and compared him to the likes of lincon and jfk, the man has done nonthing! and were setting our selves up for a hard fall if we keep telling our president that he cant mess up, then hes gonna relly screw up and were gonna ignore it until its too late! and to answer your question, its a stupid question and it has no true question, if you want to know the answer, then take a national survey and see how many people admit to being racist and ask them their political party, its not going to happen so shame on you for asking such a stupid question|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Both have their share, but for the time being...given that the media and Obama instructed the loyal minions to get in people's faces--it's pretty obvious right now it is liberals. They don't like any dissent, of any kind...therefore, the playbook says to automatically insult and attempt to discredit if you don't have an answer. Calling people racists, rednecks, and white trash based on party affiliation is blatant racism. And anyone who gives themselves a pat on the back for being the white guilt crusader needs to get a clue. FIRST...they don't give a crap about you, they just want to go about their business--SECOND...what is your purpose and intent when you go after anyone who disagrees with you? The purpose is to discredit and have others attack them.

I live in NY state, and I can tell you, in my area, there are more black conservatives than there are white conservatives.  Most of the blacks I know think Obama is way too liberal, someone who doesn't represent their views on pretty much everything.  They don't appreciate the race card that is being thrown out there by the Democratic Party.  They also don't appreciate it when people say things to them like the people have said to you--such as "You can't be black, you're conservative!"  If that isn't thinly veiled racism, I don't know what is.<br>  <br>  But there are plenty of racists on both sides.  So it would be hard to discern what side is more racist.|`|02sblnZGaa	Conservatives...because they are a lot in the south, the south is where segregation started. Let me ask you this question, when obama won the presidency where was there much violent and burning of obama's pictures and anything that has obama in it. IN THE SOUTH. They' re racist over there, why do you think I haven't traveled down there. Here in the midwest we are not as racist.|`|ZlsUXNSGaa	The answers to this question alone show that both parties are equally racist/prejudice.  Not all Republicans/Conservatives are racist.

I can't give you an "average" racism figure for a Democrat and a Republican, partly because I haven't polled people and mostly because I don't think it's that black and white (no pun intended...).<br>  <br>  I don't think all Republicans are racist, I don't think all Democrats are racist, and I don't think race determines which party you align yourself with.

I don't think I have met a racist Republican, personally. But I've met a few racist Democrats. <br>  <br>  All my professors have been Democrats. But I'm only in my first year of school. So not all of them are in Section 8 and living in the hood. <br>  <br>  What really irritates me is that some people think that you have to be a Democrat if you are black. If you are black and conservative by nature, then you should be Republican.|`|ciqAXgCgaa	conservatives are because they didn't vote for the black guy.  liberals aren't because they didn't vote for the white guy.|`|iTetA3oCaa	Because they have no ambition or original ideas.

We conservatives follow the teachings of the Bible to love our neighbor.  The Bible does not tell us what color they are.  We conservatives also believe in the constitution as it was originally created and not the current one modified by liberal judges.  The original constitution stated all men (women) are created equal.  The real problems are not from color, sex, religion, but on ones life choices that has more influence on how your life unfolds.  <br>  <br>  Liberals tend to blame others for their faults.  Everyone, needs to take responsibility for their own actions and don't blame others.|`|AA10690306	Actually, it really does not make much of a difference whether Black/White/Chicano there are racist in all walks of life and all races.  The main difference I have noted is that if the parents are more willing to accept others the children are also.  And for some reason I have yet to figure out the more education someone has the less chance they are racist.<br>  <br>  Former, Republican Christian now Independent Atheist.

You'll get answers to questions you never asked. I think it's partly because there are a lot of children here.<br>  <br>  Racism takes different forms. Patronization of a race is more insidious than open hatred, but to me they're both taking another's race into consideration as a factor in how they treat that other person. In both cases, it's racist. <br>  <br>  I don't think it's a liberal/conservative thing.

They were better off under Sadam than they are now.  Captain Bush and his cronies really screwed up, not to mention the unnecessary war and over 4000 soldiers killed.  I hope murder is added to the list when he is charged with war crimes.  Socialism?  Let's see:  social security, medicare, medicaid, unemployment.  Did I miss any?

It starts straight down the line, and then people get soft, and kind, and concerned, and kinder, and softer, and then they legislate against firmness because it's not nice, and then tehy legislate against the next thing, and the next, and then you wake up one day and find you're in a fascist state: the only difference being they'll shoot you now for a different bunch of things than they would if you were in a 'real' fascist state.  Society becomes so weak it can't protect itself and then it is overrun by the next bunch of barbarians that come along.  Yay.  This one goes round and round and round.  <br>  <br>  Guard your own family.  You can't change this process: you can only protect your family, raise them to be honest and straight, show them the ironies and ambiguities that you see.  None of you have to change it, you just have to OUTLAST it and hopefully at the end that when all the nice cheek-turning drones society has created are all being slaughtered by the people taking over your country, your kids or their kids still have a broad enough morality, a realistic enough understanding of life and justice and power, that they fight back and survive.  <br>  <br>  Or at least, that's what I'm doing.  Although we've got a national government, after years of pinko left-wing, so we're actually seeing the pendulum go the other way, which is nice....

Americans have felt the consequences of the give-to-the-rich, unrestrained markets, philosophy of the Republicans and now they just want any hope of a way out.<br>  <br>  Most seem to understand that our current problems are at least partially fueled by American' understanding that the last administration was unable and/or unwilling to bring positive change for the majority of Americans.

BrZVjDn2aa	You could, but I think it's more difficult to get hired after the cut off age<br>  <br>  The FAA values and hires men and women who already have air traffic control experience. We hire three types of experienced controllers:<br>  <br>  Veterans with military air traffic control experience<br>  Retired military controllers<br>  Current and prior civilian air traffic controllers<br>  At a minimum, experienced controllers must have:<br>  <br>  52 consecutive weeks of air traffic control experience in a military or civilian air traffic control facility that shows you have the knowledge, skills, and ability to perform air traffic controller duties<br>  Comprehensive knowledge of air traffic control laws, rules, and regulations<br>  Veterans with Military Air Traffic Control Experience<br>  <br>  The FAA can use a Veterans Recruitment Appointment (VRA) to hire veterans with military air traffic control experience. Some veterans with this experience can apply for a VRA appointment but they must be discharged from active duty or on terminal leave, and have not reached age 31. These types of veterans are eligible to apply for a VRA appointment:<br>  <br>  Disabled veterans<br>  Veterans separated from active duty within 3 years<br>  Veterans who served on active duty in the Armed Forces during a war declared by Congress, or in a campaign or expedition for which a campaign badge has been authorized<br>  Veterans who, while serving on active duty in the Armed Forces, participated in a military operation for which the Armed Forces Service Medal was awarded<br>  Retired Military Controllers<br>  <br>  The FAA hires former military air traffic controllers who retired from the United States armed forces. Retired military air traffic controllers can apply if:<br>  <br>  They are on terminal leave pending retirement from active duty military service, or<br>  They retired from active duty on or after September 17, 1999|`|cbIxKGZVaa	FAA does have a cut off and I think 31 is right because I was looking into cross training into ATC and then getting out and doing it for the FAA but I was advised that by then I would have been passed the age limit|`|JOXQrsw0aa	The FAA cut off age is 30 not 31, unless a controller is retired military. Then he can be hired and work till he is 56. There are going to be a lot of FAA jobs coming available very soon  and a lot of opportunity for advancement, because  most of the current group of controllers were hired in the wake of President Reagan's firing of all PATCO controllers who participated in the illegal strike in 1981:<br>  <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5604656" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story...</a>

I agree we need to go back to the old ways 20% down and honest applications that have actual proof of income etc.  People that bought with those terms and no ARMs just to get what they wanted more than anything!

y8b86tTEaa	California penal code 653k defines what's a legal pocket knife and switchblade.<br>  California Penal Code 12020 covers street carry of knives.<br>  <br>  In short, statewide there is NO length limit neither on folding knives, nor on the fixed blades. However, folding knives CAN be carried concealed, while fixed blades have to be  carried in open.<br>  Local towns and cities may have their law limiting the length. I know that San Francisco and Oakland have 3in blade length limit on the folders.<br>  <br>  Sadly not all of the police officers know the law, or at least this section of penal code. I've never had a problem, but I've heard stories about cops giving trouble to folks carrying fixed blades on the belt.<br>  Eventually it's gonna sort out, but it's a hassle.<br>  <br>  So, you can carry folding knife of any length as long as it's not a ballisong(butterfly) or switchblade knife.<br>  For fixed blades the banned type is dirk or a dagger. In simpler words, no double edged stuff. <br>  <br>  you can also check out <a href="http://knifeforums.com" rel="nofollow">http://knifeforums.com</a> and <a href="http://bladeforums.com" rel="nofollow">http://bladeforums.com</a> for more on current knife related laws.<br>  <br>  P.S. John S. Can you elaborate on your statement regarding dirks and daggers? As per penal code: "As used in this section, a"dirk" or "dagger" means a knife or other instrument with or without a handguard that is capable of ready use as a stabbing weapon that may inflict great bodily injury or death." It's extremely vague and can be applied to a screwdriver, ballpoint pen or whatever else. "other instrument" opens wide possibilities.|`|48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	Visor was going fine until he got to the meaning of "dirk or dagger."

I can tell you as a female that I got respect from male Marines by not whining and crying, by not being  a slut and by pulling my own weight.<br>  <br>  As a female in the Marine Corps you won't get respect you'll have to earn it like anything else in the Marine Corps. <br>  <br>  But remember women have their place.. The infantry isn't one of them, so know your limitations and let a man be a man.  If a man wants to hold the door for you be a lady and let him, don't try and be all hard.  But at the same time, know when to stick up for yourself too, don't be a wet noodle.<br>  <br>   I got a lot out of the Marine Corps and it shows in my civilian life. I am the most organized and squared away of any of my co workers. I show up on time and looking professional.  I get more done in less time and with better results.  But more is also expected of me, because I was a Marine, which is fine by me.  Hope that helps.

These media outlets never question or raise questions about Obama, his past, his associations or they never question his judgment on his selections for his Administration... That sounds like bias to me! When Bush or Clinton were President they criticized, scandalized them to hell and gone, they even demonized Palin and McCain, but they kissed Obama's *** and turned into a rock star, God like Messiah and never question anything about him. They never even mentioned Michelle's racist "whitey" comment during the campaign. They never questioned or criticized Obama over Rev.

Cabrera was soon invited to a December 1995 pre-Christmas event at the White House and was photographed with First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. The next month in January 1996, undercover agents arrested Cabrera with three tons of Colombian cocaine. Prior to Cabrera's January arrest, he had been arrested twice on drug charges, and pleaded guilty to non-drug-related charges in both cases. Cabrera is serving a 19-year prison sentence.

Trie plead guilty to a felony charge of causing false statements and a misdemeanor count of making political contributions in the names of others.<br>  <br>  It was Charlie Trie who arranged for international Chinese weapons dealer, Wang Jun, chairman of CITIC, the chief investment arm of the PRC, and Poly Technologies (a "front company for the PRC military") to meet with Mr. Clinton at a Democrat Party event at the White House on Feb. 6, 1996. CITIC Ka Wah Bank includes 28 branches in Hong Kong, a branch in Macau, a branch in Shanghai and its PRC-incorporated wholly-owned subsidiary, CITIC Ka Wah Bank (China) Limited, which is headquartered in Shenzhen with branches in Shanghai and Beijing. The Bank also has branches in New York and Los Angeles.<br>  <br>  At the time Clinton met with Wang, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Customs Service were wrapping up an investigation which caught Wang's company smuggling at least $4 million worth of 2,000 illegal AK-47 assault weapons destined for gang members in California. President Clinton later admitted Wang's attendance at the White House was "clearly inappropriate."<br>  <br>  Grigory Loutchansky, linked by Interpol to the Russian mafia, money laundering, drug trafficking, nuclear smuggling across the Baltics, and international arms trading, attended a Democrat Party White House dinner in October of 1993. Loutchansky got a private two-minute meeting and a picture with Mr. Clinton. (The Washington Times, 2/11/97; The Detroit News, 2/16/97; New York Post, 11/1/96; Time, 7/8/96) Loutchansky was invited back to a second DNC dinner in July 1995. A year before, Canada had blocked Loutchansky from entering Canada because he had failed a background check. Canadian officials also had questions about the source of Loutchansky's Nordex company's assets. (The Washington Times, 3/1/97) Both of Clinton's CIA Directors James Woolsey and John Deutch described Loutchansky's Nordex company as an "organization associated with Russian criminal activity."<br>  <br>  <br>  Eric Wynn, a twice-convicted securities promoter who pleaded guilty to stock manipulation that benefited a member of the Bonanno organized crime family and who served two years in prison for theft and tax charges, attended a December 1995 White House coffee with Clinton. In 1996, Wynn attended four other DNC fund-raising events involving Clinton. Wynn has been arrested five times during the last six months while out on bail for aggravated assault on a police officer, resisting arrest, aggravated assault with a motor vehicle, violation of a restraining order, terroristic threats and driving while intoxicated. At least one of the arrests occurred between DNC fund-raisers Wynn attended in 1996 with Clinton.

Tamraz is a former financier wanted, according to a 1989 Interpol warrant, in Lebanon for embezzling $200 million from his failed bank. On June 2, 1995, Tamraz was briefed by a National Security Council (NSC) expert on Russia at the same time he was negotiating a multibillion-dollar deal to build a pipeline from oil reserves from the Caspian Sea to Turkey through Azerbaijan and Armenia. On July 26, Tamraz contributed $20,000 to the DNC. After the meeting occurred, then-DNC Party Chairman Don Fowler called an NSC official to try to overturn a recommendation that Tamraz not attend high-level White House meetings. Tamraz went on to attend four more White House events with Clinton which included receptions, dinners and the premiere of the movie "Independence Day." Tamraz, through his New York-based oil company, gave $50,000 to the DNC after going to a DNC sponsored White House reception on Sept. 11, 1995, and a dinner four days later.

What it does do is provide a one stop shop for people and countries who want to invest money. When that money is invested in U.S. companies, those companies can grow larger, be more innovative and hire more people. A market crash does just the opposite. It creates an unwillingness on the part of investors to risk their money...thus shuts down companies who would otherwise depend on the financial input that a raise in their particular stocks would bring, thus shutting down their ability to be innovative. The more the market drops, the less money is available to companies....and when you combine that with the general population becoming afraid due to the market downturn, spending comes to a halt. That halt in spending then takes away company profit margins and cuts production needs...thus people lose jobs.

The national debt is what is owed to investors; the budget is what's spent in a fiscal year. If expenditures exceed receipts, the budget is said to be in deficit; the Treasury then issues bonds and T-bills for the difference, which are then sold on the open market. Selling these securities adds to the national debt (what we owe creditors).<br>  <br>  President Clinton entered office with a budget deficit. In 1993, he signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation package, which put the budget on what's referred to as a "glide slope" for surplus; had he attempted to balance the budget in just one fiscal year, it probably would have induced a sharp recession. It took a while to actually bring the budget into balance (during which time there were additions to the national debt), but he left office with a budget surplus.<br>  <br>  What's more important than the absolute number though, is the national debt's size relative to GDP.

I don't want to see that again, here in the US, in London, Madrid, or anywhere else.<br>  <br>  Think about why we are there, and you'll have your answer. There are people who used, and still use, that country that hate us, and all we stand for, and will do anything, including killing themselves, to harm us.|`|moe1CJTyaa	The Taliban would take over Afghanistan again, making life miserable for the innocent people there.<br>  They would then build up power over the coming years, putting the US and UK at high risk of attacks again, maybe something even as bad as 9/11.<br>  That's why we can't just pull out whenever we please.|`|00edd366abb2b33249aae666469aaa31aa	Great idea.

I laugh to myself when people say it is all George Bush's Fault though really. It definitely took more than 8 years to get to this point and it will take probably that long or longer to get back to where we were. Although poor decisions by George Bush helped fuel the decline in the economy  he did not do it alone.<br>  <br>  I truly believe we will see the great depression off the 1930's repeat itself. My mother and my grandparents talk about waiting in line for monthly rations of things like sugar, meat, butter, flour and even pantyhose which is something no decent women left home without then. They tell stories about how they shared with neighbors because my uncle owned a farm and they had things like milk, eggs, chickens  and how they ate horse meat because they did not have beef. People pulled together to get through with neighbors and friends. I think that is one elements we lack now a days as Americans, that our relatives had back then people looked out for each other. <br>  <br>  I a a nurse I coach and cheering at local high school and I live in Massachusetts. On my way to work which is a 17 mile ride there are about 65 foreclosed homes...on my way to local high school two and a half miles away there are 17 foreclosed homes. <br>  <br>  So the answer to your question is it is worse than many Americans realize..Obama is an intelligent man, a great public speaker, and has some great ideas on how he whats America and How to achieve it Can he do in in 4 years absolutely not... can he do it in 8 we should start to see things getting a lot better by then.....if the world was smart the would re-elect him and eventually do what they did for Roosevelt who was president from 1933 to 1945 and allow Obama to remain in office until we are economically stable and securely recovered<br>  <br>  hope this helped|`|AA12121752	It is a complete mess - the Labour party have run the economy into the ground.|`|AA12349988	I guess I am one of the lucky ones.<br>  <br>  I got made redundant at the beginning and have found a new job which I hope will ride out the downturn.

The poor are getting blamed for buying homes without being able to pay for them and that's not what happened! The banks were pushing sales at a rate that couldn't stand against NAFTA and big business! They were crying to congress about labor cost and got NAFTA passed so they could do away with American labor wholesale! Well they did and many sent company's south of the border thinking it would be cheaper to hire Mexican labor and are now getting burnt by doing so! Put the American work force out of jobs and no one will buy what your selling! Next company's start laying off workers that can't find new employment and can't make their payment's on their homes and it starts like this and where will it end? When the people at Wall Street find out that it don't work this way and they are big time now! Look at the stock market! Falling like a rock and they only have themselves to blame! No one keeping an eye on the markets and shifty people like Madoff can steal a fortune and no one knows until its too late! Ain't life in America great? I know that Bush had something to do with the price of oil going up so he could have a nice little retirement check along with his presidential benefits! Americas asleep at the wheel and don't even know it until the car runs off the road, kinda like now! Oh by the way I have your stimulus package! If you want it just turn around and bend over!

In the western world it is mostly taught that North America is one continent, South America another, whereas in some places it is taught that 'America' is one continent and Oceana is another (we don't see Oceana as a continent, either.)  However, America typically refers to the United States of America, just as Brazil refers to the United States of Brazil and Mexico to the United States of Mexico.

dpSr0icwaa	what you have here is a conflict between ethics and laws.<br>  <br>  Now, the law has to place some very bright and quantitative lines in it's text.  In this case these would be drinking age and % alcohol driving age.<br>  <br>  However, these values are somewhat arbitrary and no ethics hang on them, just laws.<br>  <br>  The underlying conditions have the ethical implications...being too young to responsibly consume alcohol, and drinking enough to be impared while driving.<br>  <br>  Now, the tricky thing about drunk driving is just a few beers can start to give some impairment.  However, it varies from person to person, depending on body size and how often they drink.  Note, a person need not be 'drunk' to have thier abilities be impared.<br>  <br>  What you need to do is to decide if this person is buzzed or drunk enough to be impared for later driving, and if so, what to do about it.<br>  <br>  you have a 2 hour window.  Normally even a light drinker of average size of the female gendercan handle 1 drink an hour and be totally fine.  A larger male, or a guy who drinks somewhat regularly should be able to handle 2.  A guy who drinks a fair amount can handle 3.<br>  <br>  I suggest you get him to bring the beer in right away.  Say 'might as well grab your 6 pack right now and toss it in our fridge, you'll be back out here for it in about an hour anyways'<br>  <br>  Follow this with 'hey, remember you normally grab those about an hour in, you got to strech them out a little more this time...besides I'd feel really guilty if you got a ticket after stopping by to see me' if he starts drinking them with gusto.<br>  <br>  Heck you may even want to ask for a single beer yourself, and just sip on it, maybe not even finish it and dump it after he goes.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	If he drinks 6 beers in 3 hours or less, then wants to take off driving and you won't call the cops, you're no real friend of his. The next best thing would be to drive him home yourself.|`|AA11729094	Get him to drink the beers first then start talkin so he won't be drunk when he leaves.|`|AA10500537	even if he is your friend dont answer the door and that way you wont be responsible when he does get caught,|`|5CPgTpXeaa	next time take his keys and if that doesn't work. call the cops anyway. sure he's ur friend but i am sure you would want him alive rather tah dead. driving buzzed is still the same as driving drunk|`|6pUzzsuhaa	a 6 pack will usually get someone over the legal limit. and having a buzz is being drunk (just on the way to getting drunk drunk)<br>  <br>  the right thing to do would be to ask/tell him to drink the 6 pack first and talk for a while then leave- it's safer for everyone.  [i know someone who is now mentally challenged because of a car wreck with someone who was drinking]<br>   <br>  (my dad got pulled over for a DUI from drinking beer.. me and my lil bro were with him.. so i have a good idea)<br>  <br>  also, how tall is he and how much does he weigh? that affects how the alcohol is processed in the body- someone who is bigger (height and weight wise will need more beer, whiskey, etc to get them drunk- like me for example- because of my size- 5'1 and 120 lbs, it would take a lot lot less to get someone my size drunk than someone who's larger/taller than me)|`|RkfIPD7Iaa	A six pack in a hour will probably make him over the legal limit.<br>  <br>  But, since you don't want to call the cops, I guess you just let him drive away.  Expect one day to visit him in jail or a hospital, though.

They will deny their losses and live in the fantasy land that they have created for themselves were everything runs fine and is paid for all without any taxes. They will claim that WMD is still in Iraq and that we just haven't looked hard enough and that Katrina,famine and all the worlds ills are caused by Nancy Pelosi....they will remain as delusional as they are today!

Republicans dont ever plan on losing. Repubican put all thier planning efforts into winning. Here's why: You can lose without spending time and money on developing a plan to lose.<br>  <br>  Republicans plan for victories- not defeats. It's why Republicans have NEVER said that the war in Iraq was lost, even when the Democrats did.

In deployed locations, that's another story though: there military members run LANS/WANS for operations centers, UAS systems, and base-operating-support.<br>  Also, keep in mind that as an "Engineer" in the AF, and other services too, you aren't "doing" the engineering.  Instead you're supervising the said DOD civilians/contractors and acting more as a project manager.<br>  Also, engineering-types aren't normally on the fast-track for promotion, and are usually the first on the chopping block for any involuntary separations to reduce manpower. In the AF this happened just a few years ago.|`|bDmBOwNRaa	I work as a voice network systems and we deal with a telephone switch and deal with the voice and data side.

Crime rates depend very much on the social structure of a country, a region (state) or town. According to our profiling (one of my professions) you usually have lower crime rates in rural, prosperous areas as opposed to the poorer, more violent districts of big towns. Our efforts  to reduce these rates aim at the roots of these problems (poverty, poor schooling, joblessness i.e. lack of jobs), curing just the effects gets only short term results. Violent action by  the authorities, such as an increase in punishment, only creates a more violent reaction, it is not a solution. The US government and the authorities know this and  have long term plans to improve things, such as increased surveillance (humint and techint) In Italy, where I have a Nat-Security role, we have just passed a law to utilise retired police and security officers in the role of  unarmed Volunteer vigilantes, in combination with Video surveillance. Crime rates have been going down recently, but a great deal still has to be done. I agree with your Dad on point one, and I’m for  a stricter law enforcement (we were releasing criminals too readily – one particular delinquent was arrested 84 times; a raper was released on parole and promptly raped a 14 year old), without, however, corporal punishment, tempting but not part of our culture.|`|BF27cDnbaa	Deporting illegal aliens would not only lower crime, it would also save millions in tax dollars. Illegals don't pay taxes but they still go to our schools and hospitals since those places cant refuse anyone. Having longer sentences for serious crimes and bringing back the death penalty in more places would also help. Put the military, preferably the USMC, in charge of the police force. That will solve a lot of problems.|`|yiPZ1UZAaa	I would like to see Obama's administration place a ban on guns and change the 2nd amendment.|`|exOOXAkBaa	It's all about the illegals from Mexico killing our home grown Americans.|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  1) The only thing a country can really do when crime is out of hand is to suspend parts of the constitution temporarily and set up a police or military state.<br>  Certainly rights of speech and assembly go but then again you can safely walk the streets at 2 AM. In countries that were former police states from South Africa to Argentina, you can say what you like and run for office now but the crime rates are just dreadful and many are immigrating for that reason. You are changing one type of freedom for another.<br>  <br>  2) As a form of capital punishment, bring in the guillotine. Now some Christian sects will be scared of this given the New World order and all but decapitation is quite frightening and perhaps criminals will think a good 10x before doing their deeds. <br>  <br>  3) Anyone caught with over 200 grams of a illegal drug, especially celebrities ought to face the death penalty like Indonesia. Demand is a big part of the drug problem.<br>  <br>  Finally a country like Saudi would fit this bill. Nevertheless, a colleague of mine working their in the oil industry went for a leak in a restaurant washroom in Jeddah. He took off this 30 k Rolex President and left in on the sink. To his horror, 3 hours later, he realized what he had done. Upon returning with little hope, there was his watch still on the sink... it hadn't moved an inch!<br>  <br>  Sadly I cannot stomach these harsh measures I mention but at the same time people seem to understand fear as opposed to love and benevolance. So long as there is no fear of authority, many dangerous criminals will continue to operate with immunity and impunity.<br>  <br>  Please pass my point on to your father; see what he thinks!<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|dc2cb706f625bf4f0720140360b38e90aa	I think prisons should be harsher.  Why should the inmates be allowed cable television and exercise equipment?  They can get their news from the newspaper and do exercises that do not require fancy equipment or weights .  The inmates should be forced to work and take continuing education classes, GED)  if they want parole.  There is no reason why the prisons can not grow their own foodI realize that some prisoners are well educated and/or not physically able to do hard labor, but for most inmates, these will be positive lessons.  I would also demand psycolocgical counseling for the inmates.<br>  <br>  Boot camps are an acceptible option to replace caning lesser offenders.|`|Shp5riE6aa	Deport all illegal aliens.

Most people repay violence with violence.<br>  <br>  As it is, prison sentences are too long already.  In a recent case, judges were BRIBED by privately-run prisons to give overly-long sentences; as long sentences for prisoners mean more profits for prisons.  It's an isolated case, but from this we can tell that a privately-run prison system  encourages long sentences.<br>  <br>  The long sentences don't do much to protect society, because they don't deter criminals...since most criminals don't expect to be caught!<br>  Once they get past 30 years of age, there's very little chance of them re-offending.<br>  <br>  Most prisoners are in jail for drug-related charges; they commit crime to pay for their habit.  Therefore, the best way to prevent crime is to get more anti-drug programs; in other words, make it easier for people to get off their drug habits.  A couple of month in rehab is a lot cheaper than 10 years in prison.|`|AA11707728	We need to eliminate the prison system and replace it with citizen militias that are armed to the teeth.  The slightest hint of criminal behavior from someone should result in their immediate death and disposal.  Troublesome populations (example: the entire population of New Orleans) should be fenced in and not allowed to leave.  Illegal aliens should be rounded up and killed.  Their bodies dropped from the sky by aircraft over mexican cities....to make a very clear point....don't come here...or else.<br>  <br>  The ONLY reason there is alot of crime is we tolerate it.  To the extent it is not tolerated, it disappears.  Good example....every time a municipality adopts open and easy gun carry laws, crime plummets....why?  Simple.  It becomes too dangerous to be a criminal.  About 1 million times a year, a gun is used to stop a violent crime, by the way.  Violence is the solution to crime.  The more, the better.|`|QvSwo3X9aa	If beating on people and killing them would deter crime then third world countries would be paradises free of crime. I personally don't think it would be an improvement to go from being afraid of criminals to being afraid of the "good guys" who have too much power (like in dictatorships). The root of crime is hopelessness and lack of guidance. If we improved the school systems and strengthened peoples core values crime would improve.<br>  <br>  Proverbs 22:6<br>  Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old, he will not depart from it

The only solution is to let our economy recover naturally, and that can be accomplished faster by cutting spending.<br>  <br>  Instead Obama is increasing spending.  He's taking money from the winners of the business world and redistributing it to the losers.  There's also quite a bit of pork in his plan that they shoved down our throats.<br>  <br>  When the republican party was in power they did not cut spending either.  Instead they increased government spending while cutting taxes at the same time.  Think about that.<br>  <br>  How do you have tax cuts, while at the same time increase government spending?

Iran is a radical country that has publicly stated their intent to destroy another country. The step from nuclear fusion to produce electricity and nuclear fusion to produce a bomb capable of that destruction is very small. It is just a matter of upgrading to the next level. Israel knows that Iran WILL use nuclear weapons if given the chance. Radicals will do anything...even if it means the likely distruction of its own people...and devastation to the rest of the world. That is why Israel may take action before that can happen and that is why WE should be supportive of them if they do.

We need to raise holy hell.  I live in Ca. We are gathering signatures to recall Arnuld and we have been calling Hollingsworth and asking him to oust Maldanado. He is a traitor.  We have so much work to do still.  Here is something interesting.  I checked it out and it is true.<br>  <br>  Obama Decrees: Massive Immigration of Hamas Refugees from Gaza<br>  <br>  by Lou Dobbs<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Obama has signed a presidential determination allowing  hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to resettle in the United  States. Sure, what can go wrong when we allow hundreds of thousands of people who have been, as Mark Steyn memorably described, "marinated" in a "sick death cult," who voted for Hamas, and 55% of whom support suicide bombings live here and<br>  <br>  at the American taxpayers' expense:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  By executive order, on January 27, (Federal Register on February 4) Obama has ordered the expenditure of $20.3 million in urgent migration assistance to the Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza to resettle in the United States.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Few on Capitol Hill took note that the order provides a free ticket replete with housing and food allowances to individuals who have displayed their overwhelming support of the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) in the parliamentary election of January 2006 at US taxpayers expense.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Let's review some of Obama's most recent actions since he was inaugurated a little more than two weeks ago:<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  His first call to any head of state as president was to Mahmoud Abbas, leader of Fatah party in the Palestinian territory. <br>   <br>  <br>  His first one-on-one interview with any news organization was with Al Arabia television. <br>   <br>  <br>  He ordered Guantanamo Bay closed and all military trials of detainees halted. <br>   <br>  <br>  He ordered all overseas CIA interrogation centers closed. <br>   <br>  <br>  He withdrew all charges against the masterminds behind the USS Cole and 9/11. <br>   <br>  <br>  Today we learn that he is allowing hundreds of thousands of Palestinian refuges to move to and live in the US at American taxpayer expense. <br>   <br>  <br>  So We can't pay our own bills. Our economy is dying, hundreds of thousands of people are losing their jobs, and now we will pay to move terrorists and their supporters to live free in our country? What about the thousands of our brave soldiers who gave their lives to fight these terrorists?<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Obama insulted the Medal of Honor Award winners at their Inauguration Ball by being the first President in over 40 years to not show up and now he's inviting their very enemies to come live in our country at our expense? Why not just send all of our weapons over there and allow them to kill us now? Dead, It will be less painful!<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Now you see why the founding fathers wanted to protect us from a president with devided loyalties! Now do you see why congress and the Supreme court should have made Obama show proof of natural born citizenship.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Read more  <br>  <br>  And we will pay for these low life scum bags.

There was no union labor nor was there overtime and holiday pay.  If the job was not completed on time, or if it ran into cost overrun, the company contracted had to foot the bill.  In the case of falling behind schedule, the company was fined X amount of dollars (Yen) per day until the work was completed satisfactorily.  People there actually take great pride in their work and accomplishments.<br>  <br>  When I was stationed at Camp Pendleton, my kids initially were enrolled in the Oceanside schools.  There was a uniform the students were required to wear.  The elementary school had a problem with both gangs and drugs.  My son came home, beat up every day.  He received the beatings because I made him wear the uniforms.  I went to the school and spoke with the Dean of Discipline.  He informed me that the uniform policy was unenforceable, that while all of the parents initially agreed to it, they began calling upon special interest groups who would threaten to sue the schools for discriminating against those who are poor.  Learning was not taking place there and so I moved my kids to the schools situated on base.<br>  <br>  Those on base schools were funded by the same public schools, had the same school administration and the same pool of teachers, yet there was a huge difference -- that being that the parents of he students all believed in the same basic principles of how to get ahead.  There, learning took place.<br>  <br>  I tell you about this school experience because it is the foundation of the "what's in it for me" mentatlity that has gripped this nation and driven it to its knees economically.  It begins at home with what IS and is NOT being taught and spider webs out from there.  Can you imagine having an open bid contract that first requires that you only accept bids from companies who only hire union labor?  Want to kow why NAFTA came about?  It was an attempt to circumvent the high cost of shoddy production, charged by union labor.  It actually costs less to send raw materials overseas, have it manufactured and then sent back than it does to just have it built here.  Gas prices too, have been a symptom of supply and demand.  Jimmy Carter raised the EPA standards on the building of oil refineries to the point that it no longer makes good economic sense to try and build one here.  At the time he upped the standards, there were over 600 refineries in operation throughout the country.  Today, there are less than 150.  Supply and demand.<br>  <br>  I too have been forced to raise the cost of my services.  Every year my state (Florida) raises its minimum wage.  If I don't raise the cost of services, I cannot afford to stay in business.  If I give the lowest employee the raise as required, then everyone above them demands a raise as well to reflect their time in service and seniority.  Something, somewhere has to give.  I'd say let the change begin with the mindset of the people, but they'd rather blame anyone other than themselves and so they elect officials who contrive to treat the symptoms of the economic situation rather than treating the root cause.  Bottom line, you don't throw money at money problems.  Currently, the plan is to give you each a $13 dollar a week break in taxes.  You are not to be trusted with actual cash, so instead, you just get the reduction.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	I'm not reading your question....way too long.  The fact is that we already pay a gas tax to cover this.  The gas tax  revenues are decreasing because of use of public transportation and more fuel efficient cars.  If they enacted this mileage and did away with the fuel tax it would be a total loss to the community who is concerned about global warming.|`|f702cfc86c32f9c4c16e495b7e47297aaa	That might not be a bad solution.

aFC72tLZaa	McCain was the first person to admit that he knows absolutely nothing about economics.  The party of NO wants to cut taxes, which is like spending, but takes longer to take effect.  The top 200 economists in this country agree that something has to be done now.  That's why Obama made history with his plan. Beside opening his big mouth about not knowing anything about economics, his 2nd mistake of many was picking Sarah Palin for VP.  This ruined any credibilty he had left.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	ship all the libs to north korea for reindoctrination!|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	Real Republicans didn't want McCain either.  But to answer your question.

3caq6SFxaa	It was the battle fought primarily in the Atlantic Ocean (again mainly Northern Atlantic) to interfere with the supply routes between the US (which was producing the war materials) and the Russian and English ports where they were unloaded for use.  The convoy system of putting large groups of merchant ships together with destroyer and other war ships to protect them was one reason for the change in the balance (in 1942 more material was sunk then made it through) and caused a dip in 1943 which was then changed back to the German favour in 1944 with the German adoption of the wolf pack strategy and the snorkel.  The capture of the Enigma machine, by the British in real life was a factor in the end defeat of the German U-Boat threat, but not a major one-the breaking of the code allowed planners to know in what areas U-Boats were operating but the areas were very large expanses of ocean and the location of the U-Boats was not exact.  Honestly the reason the allies won the Battle of the Atlantic was simply put that we could produce and ship it faster then the Germans could sink it.  Much the same reason the Sherman tank beat the German panzer's made enough so that losing three to five Shermans per panzer knocked out didn't really matter since we made 10 to one; it was not the Sherman was better then the Panther or Tiger or even the late model PkZ III we just had a lot more and could lose more.|`|Gc8ORtMuaa	It happened because in the Second World War there were a lot of merchant ships crossing the atlantic carrying supplies (some military, but lots of other goods too) between the UK and America. The Germans sent out U boats to destroy as many as possible. They safest way for the merchant ships to travel was in groups, escorted by naval ships armed with depth charges. They used a code (called enigma) to send messages. A lot is written about the codebrakers in Bletchley Park, but there were also many others involved in the attempts to break the code - a spy named Hans Schmidt who stole enigma manuals and gave them to the French, the capture of parts of the machines and codebooks from captured german u boats and other vessels, and Polish codebreakers who later in the war worked in France and England.|`|uXrQxxWMaa	Firstly you need to see the film "Enigma" with Kate Winslet, Jeremy Northam, and Dougray Scott.  It's a work of fiction, but the backdrop is real.<br>  <br>  The Battle of The Atlantic raged from 1942 - 1945 between the German U Boats, and the Allied Convoys whose mission was to keep the allied war effort supplied.<br>  <br>  At a huge cost in boats, supplies, and men the Allies won through, mainly due to the brilliant work carried out by the cipher experts at Bletchley, (see film).<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|7b71287270d8cb608d239de158f4a044aa	It seems to be wrongly called a 'battle'. It was actually more of a campaign. When the 'Battle of Britain' (itself another campaign) was won by the RAF the opposing Germans realised that due to the strength of the Royal Navy - then the largest Navy in the world - the only way to beat the British was to starve us into submission. Starve us not only of food but also of the means to fight back. Large numbers of 'U' boats (unterseebooten) or submarines were built with the object of of sinking our merchant marine ships and denying us the materiel to fight the war. It was waged from 1939 right through to the end. Britain's immediate defence was to form a system of convoys of merchant ships protected by a screen of RN warships including aircraft carriers. As the war drew on improvements in aircraft design and technology meant that land based (RAF) aircraft were able to play their part. Basically in 1939 the Germans were sinking our ships faster than we could build them but by the end of 1943 this was reversed and the allies (USA and Canada as as well as the British) were sinking the U boats faster than the Germans could replace them and train their crews.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	The battle of the Atlantic was fought between 1939 up until Germany surrendered in 1945, however, for all intent and purposes it was over by the middle of 1942 when the convoy system and increasing US sea power and air patrols made the German submarine crews miserable and began to send many of them to the bottom..<br>  <br>  During the early part of the war German submarines roamed the Atlantic pretty much at will and sank millions of tons of cargo.  The Germans named this Operation Drumbeat (Operation Paukenschlag).  You can find some good information about it here.....<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.uboat.net/ops/drumbeat.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.uboat.net/ops/drumbeat.htm</a><br>  <br>  For a more comprehensive look at the whole battle you should try this web site...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/second-battle-of-the-atlantic/" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiritus-temporis.com/second-...</a>|`|96a318bea85eb2aa7d0b38b893875fb9aa	The battle was germanys intent to stop all merchant ships reaching britain with food and other vital supplies. They hoped to starve the british into submission. That was when food rationing was introduced. The method was to attack and sink merchant ships and sink them. <br>  Despite having Naval escorts, this proved very succesful for the german U boats, and they hunted in packs in the North Atlantic sea. They devised new methods of attack against the merchant ships. They knew that a merchant ship fully laden would lie low in the water, but a warship would not lie as low. They would then fire torpedos underneath the warship and hit the merchant ship it was guarding. germany U boats (underwater boats) were verysuccesful in this campaign and sent over a million tons of Merchant shipping to the bottom of the Atlantic. However we eventually broke their secret Enigma codes and were able to intercept the U boats before they attacked.
HQFfb1Vvaa	you need to determine whether you are charging someone with murder OR manslaughter. you cannot charge someone with both! every crime is composed of two elements: actus reus (the actual act) and mens rea (the mindset or intention to commit the act). in  murder, you intend to kill someone so if you wanted to show both actus reus and mens rea for murder you must establish that they caused the death and also that they intended to cause the death. if they are pleading not guilty you would need to show that they are lying and that they did actually commit the crime through medical evidence etc. <br>  <br>  if you want to convict someone of manslaughter then the mens rea element is missing ie: they did not intend to kill the person. in this case you would need to establish that the deaht was caused by the accused and also that the accused lacked the intention to commit the killing. <br>  a lot of the time in murder or manslaughter trials there wont be much questioning of the accused except for on the facts of the case. after that, its up to legal counsel to battle it out over the points of law.|`|QvF8dR7Taa	most people wont just tell you the truth,so either you have to have overwhelming evidence of you have to force a confession,there are chemicals that make a person answerer questions with out the ability to think of any fabrication,also whats called water boarding is fairly effective.there are many ways to get a confession that government people use all the time till some one squeals and then they stop that one and invent a new way to coheres people into talking.|`|1b9d6f92644c7ecc734f3330365356a8aa	You can't ask them any questions until after you have advised them that they have a right to counsel and don't have to answer any questions you may pose.  5th Amendment|`|BmnwsvfOaa	why did you kill him?.. use specific facts like .. why did u dump this girls body in the river right after u cut her body into tiny pieces?

So when you graduate there will be LOTS of applicants. My suggestion to stand above the rest is to join the Army Reserves. Also A Criminal Justice degree isn't worth it because if you don't get hired on there isn't much else you can do with that degree. At my Dads Office there is a guy with a degree in physical education and one with a degree in one in primary education. So it doesn't matter your degree.

You keep huffing and puffing about this you should go with the flow.|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	Very true. I was in the army from 2001-2004 as commo, and we still had primitive 80+ pound cellphones still in use. I mean I understand that the army has to make everything reliable for field use and able to withstand an emp blast, but still, they were way behind in some areas of technology despite spending outrageous amounts of money for other areas.<br>  <br>  Although the specific grip about body armor isn't exactly true though, since I remember them updating the body armor when I was in the military. Still, I think there were some problems coming out with the new body armor though.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	Body armour has been updated at least twice since i retired in 1993.<br>  Military has nothing but the latest and greatest equipment. And when they need something better they usually get it. When did you have your first cell Phone? The Army had them in 1988 or sooner.<br>  <br>  <br>  SFC<br>  U S Army<br>  Retired|`|AA11858035	Wasn't this brought to Rumsfeld's attention like six years ago? He didn't seem to concerned at the time.|`|3caq6SFxaa	To start with updating military gear is not like updating your phone; one problem right now is everyone wants to panic and update things for one situation that does not work in another.  The body armor the rush was to improve works great in Iraq on vehicle patrols but in Afghanistan where foot patrols and rough country is more common it is too heavy and slows reaction time down, the heavier anti IED vehicles are too big and heavy for quick/easy movement by ship or getting to shore in amphibous operations.  Military gear is or should be the best gear for  variety of uses and not the very best for one thing but bad in the rest which is why research and development is important though pointing the fungers at Generals for many of the decisions is not really accurate-most of those decisions are made by civilians in the DOD and some times military concerns are not pad attention too.   Is this a surprise or should it be a surprise as far as budget cuts go?  No he stated it rather clearly when he was running just phrased it to sound like it would not hurt the military, Clinton administration people are making Clinton administration decisions and much of the short fall and out dated equipment blamed on former President Bush is actually the result of the defense budget cuts under Clinton and the use of Hummers as combat escort vehicles is because the vehicles for that purpose were not available-Hummers were not designed to be used in combat but as rear echelon support.  Armor was added to "protect them and reduce causalities" which caused increased wear and more breakdowns and took away speed and mobility so they could take more damage but also were getting damaged longer because they could not move out of the danger area fast enough.  This was talked about more then once by military people but ignored to get a "quick fix" to a plitical hot potato.|`|Nejnh1Bqaa	Was worried about that in the 1980's when I joined the Navy.  Our shipboard small arms were, even into the 1990's old compared to those of the other services, our pistols were .45's, even after the other services switched to 9mm, our rifles were still M-14's decades after the other services adopted the M-16.|`|024e057726e56ac8f27fea7f5379e549aa	BO plans to end all wars and bring our soldiers home.

We have technology that other countries would and have killed for.  In my 2 going on 3 tours to Iraq I have seen vast upgrades in the equipment that we are receiving.  Not everything is perfect or easy to maintain, but that is what happens when you have to make equipment that will withstand the rough and tumble lifestyle that it will have to endure.  R&D tends to take a while as well, so the equipment that we need may take months or years to develop, produce, and issue.  Therefore, the Army has begun procuring equipment directly from the civilian market.  Overall, I have to say that I am quite impressed with what we routinely receive, and we are still the best equipped amd most capable fighting force on the planet.|`|JlyYRBCIaa	Well, the military is used so that the super rich international bankers and other super rich people, can make even more money. The military is only used to further the agendas of certain politicians in order to incite unnecessary wars which will make billions of dollars of revenue for a few privileged people. If the government wants you to be worried about the military gear, they will flash it on the American media(which is controlled by the government), and everyone will be consumed; so don't worry.|`|dZHSL1lKaa	The American military is one of the best in the world. There is not much need for them to "upgrade" their equipment. (Although some of their weapons are based on designs dating all the way back from World War 2.) Where America is spending a lot of money right now would be in intelligence gathering and air superiority. (It costs TONS  to make a stealth fighter.) <br>  <br>  If you look back in history, the only real time that anyone has ever upgraded anything pertaining to military was when they needed to: in war. The small skirmishes in the Middle Easts don't warrant better equipment. When a truly devastating war on a massive scale breaks out, then look for TONS of military upgrades.|`|WqIeF3nAaa	We update all of our military! We have nuclear air-craft carriers that do not have to be refiled for 26 years. Obama wants to take all of the troops out of war, but that is stupid because the enemy will potentially regroup and strike back again like what happened September 11.|`|8358nCxBaa	Dude we do update it.

YkZeA3Jvaa	They did more than allow it.  They CREATED it, and used the anti-Republican sentiment to get away with it.|`|33ppbrMJaa	It isn't Dodd and Franks who failed to regulate the banking system.  It isn't Dodd and Franks who started the War in Iraq with a dire warning of eminent disaster, nor did they drain the Treasury with the expense of this war, which wasn't even made a part of the budget, but was tacked on like some uncontrolable, money-eating monster.<br>  <br>  As a Democrat and an Obama supporter, I think that Barney Franks and Christopher Dodd should be investigated for their various activities that may or may not be aboveboard.  But cause the mortgage crisis? No way.  <br>  <br>  Remember this country was in financial trouble when Republicans had the majority and most of them were lining their pockets with deals along K Street!  As the "Arm of the Presidency," they allowed Bush free rein in spending this country's money in what has been called a "looting" of our Treasury.<br>  <br>  Good try, but your theory doesn't hold water.  I'm afraid the Republicans have to shoulder the blame and, somehow, at some time, have to admit that their ideology just doesn't work.  <br>  <br>  Republicans hate to face the truth and so they keep seeking scapegoats, but these two old Congressmen didn't cause our problems.|`|c3vPZfghaa	NO<br>  the financial sector crisis is more than just a mortgage problem and it stemmed from deregulating created by the Gramm-Leach Belily Act of 1999.<br>  You have to be delusional to think those 3 guys are responsible for credit default swaps and aren't the richest men in the USA.|`|aGzLO9Oraa	I would go so far as to say the two of them failed in their jobs and should not be reelected.

During my Junior year I joined the Army Reserves under the split training options Basic during the summer of Jr.-Sr. year and AIT after High School. This has made getting into schools very easy because I'm pretty young (Airborne and Air Assault).|`|C3LiKhm8aa	The ROTC in college would be a good option.  You would have the opportunity to get a college degree and a commission.  You could then apply for the training and schools you would need for Special Forces.<br>  <br>  The enlistment option, while attractive, eliminates some life options that you should consider holding open.  Consider these questions.<br>  <br>  What happens if you don't make Special Forces?  You're then committed to the Army and don't have a degree.  You'd have to serve out your term and then apply to college, without the ROTC option, probably.<br>  <br>  What happens if you are injured in training and can't make SF, but are able to continue in the service?  Same problems.<br>  <br>  What if you get in the service and decide that it's really not for you, at least not for a career?<br>  <br>  Is it better to serve as enlisted or commissioned?  I can't answer that for you.  I will tell you that life is usually better with a college degree than without a college degree, as the earnings statistics indicate.<br>  <br>  The recruiter is going to take one look at you and decide that you would be a great recruit.  Just remember that his job is to bring young people into the military, not worry about what's best long term for you.  You have to look out for you and not let a silver tongued salesman sell you on one course of action when you could achieve your goals another way and preserve a lot of good long-term options along the way.<br>  <br>  My vote is to go to college, take ROTC, get a commission and go through the schools and training as an officer.|`|PVnKQG8Waa	I would recommend going to ROTC, getting commisioned, then when you become 1LT (P) or CPT(promotion to CPT is automatic at 3yrs) then go SF. The route is a little longer, 4 years of college and 3 years as an officer, but you will be in charge of your team. The other option of enlisting and going SF is quicker, but you won't have any say in what the team does because you will still be green behind the ears. It will probably take just as long (7 years) to get to a decent rank where you have any influence on your team. Talk to your dad, he is retired and should be your best source for answers.
icRwgQ7waa	I am a lawyer and if I had it to do again, I would be a doctor. Perhaps it is just that the grass is greener on the other side, but most of my day is spent gathering and analyzing evidence and passing that information on to my clients who decide how to evaluate their cases. (I defend people getting sued for money). Sounds cool but in reality lawyers are a transaction cost, nothing more, and most of my job means trying to move as much paper as I can from the left side of my desk (in box) to the right side of the box (out box) before tomorrow's mail comes in. Salaries of lawyers have dropped preciptiously since I got out of school 25 yrs ago and we are under a lot more stress and have a lot less staff to do our job and the demands are higher than ever. I am well paid and help some people in my job but the demands on us (return everyone's call in 10 min, taking calls on weekends while the fax machine buzzes away....) are increasing and the satisfaction I get from my job is decreasing, and that is common in our field and people are leaving law to do other things.<br>  <br>  I think being a dr (particularly a trauma dr, surgeon, etc.) must be awesome. To be able to come home from work and know I made someone stop hurting, I saved a life, cured a disease, fixed someone's body and helped someone today must be incredibly rewarding for the doctor and the patient.<br>  <br>   I would be interested in seeing what other drs and lawyers say!

Keeping up to $13 dollars a week of your hard-earned money is a tax cut? No. Furthermore, it's merely a loan by which the interest will cost you way more. So much....it's at an interest of about 3.5 generations! So....hate isn't the correct word. Shock is more like it. Why? Because too many of you are keeping a score card on so-called kept promises that are nothing more than lip service so it qualifies technically. Don't know about you...but when it comes to my livelihood and future...technicalities are not that useful.|`|PGLZ3LiYaa	The tax cuts are letting you keep a little extra in your check, if you pay taxes. This will amount to enough to buy a gallon of milk and a loaf of bread each week.<br>  <br>  The tax cut is going to also give more money to people that do not pay any taxes. This is called income redistribution. You are taking money from the tax payer and giving it to a non tax payer.<br>  <br>  If you want to build an economy, you need jobs that produce a desired or needed product, like cars, homes, clothes, food, computers, cell phones and such. The Stimulus package does little to non of this. Many of the few jobs being created are temporary and produce no product that you would be willing to pay for. TOO much of the money is going to the Democrat party support groups, Acorn, Move-on, Trial lawyers, Unions...Not one of these produce a product. In fact they syphon money out of the economy that could be used to help the "needy" (I mean needy, not stupid, lazy and selfish)<br>  <br>  These so called tax cuts will be followed by one of two things, A tax increase on the successful making it harder for them to succeed (when you drive around, stop looking at the big names like BOA and McDonald's, and start looking at the small businesses. They are the successful that will be hurt. The guy that fixes your car or the small store will have to raise prices or lay off.), <br>  <br>  The other is printing more money, which makes the money worth less. (mix your sugar bowl half sand and half sugar, You will have twice as much, but you have to use twice as much to get the same sweetness). <br>  <br>  The Obama economy will be paid back in the near future. Hold on to your wallet. I would rather have a warehouse loaded with non parishable food than a 401k right now. It will be worth more in the future than money. <br>  <br>  Many people have worked hard all their life and are getting by on their pension, IRA and Social Security. If we get the Carter like inflation, their money will not let them survive. <br>  <br>  When I was a kid, a loaf of bread was 20 cents for the large loaf. Today that same loaf is over 200 cents. TEN TIMES more.  A car was $2000, the same type of car is now $16,000 up EIGHT TIMES. Yet, minimum wage was $2 now it is $6.55? up 3 times.<br>  <br>  Yes, I can honestly say I will give you a tax cut, but what I won't tell you is the cost of living will go up and off set it. If you make $10 per hour, you will make about $20,800 a year.The 2008 inflation rate was 3.8% you would have to get a raise of $790 this year just to break even (38 cents an hour). Obama's tax cut will be eaten by inflation alone. My company is not giving raises this year, trying to remain in business. <br>  <br>  Life is simple, you have to work to survive. If you want to survive well, you need to work harder or smarter. Get an education or skill. You are competing with other people, get a skill that is in demand. This makes the world a better place. Or you can become a politician and get rich off the back of the people.<br>  <br>  THEY WORK FOR US!!!!!!!|`|My65doewaa	Two things..<br>  <br>  1) He promising "tax cuts" for people who DON'T PAY TAXES.<br>  <br>  2) The opposition is mostly towards the trillions in waste Obama has already engaged in, and promises to carry out in the future.|`|c1y6cmAraa	Because people that work hard should be able to keep their money so they can stimulate the economy.

The earned income tax credit gives back all of the money an individual paid out, plus the credit, wich equals a...handout! Tax cuts are meant to put money back in the hands of the individuals or better yet -small businesses- who pay a humongous portion of their working capital to the federal government. Your EITC doesn't reduce the tax burden on anyone, in fact, it raises the burden placed on the shoulders of those who already pay the vast majority of all Federal taxes...the upper middle class, a.k.a. small business owners, a.k.a. entrepreneurs, a.k.a. the source of 89% of all jobs in the US. That's why it is so hated. It is not the tax cut that was advertized, but it was the one that Obummer promised during the campaign. He is bound and determined to kill our drive to work. Why would we? It's all going to get lit on fire anyhow, and only make us pay even more! A ten year old kid with a lemonade stand would run a better business model than Obummer OR Bush.

You'll hear lots of things you don't understand, like PT, LES. bulkhead, scuttlebutt and lots of Marine-speak.  You can also expect that he'll want you to be in some sort of good physical condition and understand when he gets stressed out.  <br>  <br>  Just don't freak out when you're around other Marines and don't understand what they're talking about, wait until you're alone and ask him... don't get all pissy right there... his buddies will encourage him to dump you.<br>  <br>  I can tell you from experience if you got out with him and his buddies, don't get drunk and act like a fool or a ****.  Don't flirt with his buddies ever!  If you sleep with one, they'll tell.  <br>  <br>  Don't assume every female he's friends with he's sleeping with and get all jealous and freaked out, because their are women in the Marine Corps and some of them are quite good looking.  Don't constantly nag him if he's late coming home, it's not a 9-5 job.  Don't get pissy if he can't spend time with you when you want.  Let him have his time with other Marines, it's vitally important.  Don't worry, he'll make time for you,<br>  <br>  For the love of all that's holy don't ever make him choose between another Marine and you, you'll loose ever time.<br>  <br>  Just be sweet and understanding, be what you'd want him to be, caring and supportive.<br>  <br>  If you have specific questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them for you.|`|f153f5c587854a64f0b19f95ee388282aa	Realize that he may have to work long hours without having a choice and that he can't just "call off work".|`|57N8Ls5Oaa	You will always become second.

l5HI6NFoaa	President Barack Obama has yet to announce his nominee for the Bureau of Indian Affairs but a potential pick is already generating some fire.<br>  <br>  Larry EchoHawk, a member of the Pawnee Nation of Oklahoma, is a familiar name in Indian Country. After two terms in the Idaho Legislature, where he worked on tribal issues, he became the first Native American elected to a statewide office when he was attorney general of Idaho from 1991 to 1995.<br>  <br>  The EchoHawk family is known for their Indian advocacy too. Larry's brother, John, serves as executive director of the Native American Rights Fund, where a cousin, Walter, also works. Along with his two of sons, Larry EchoHawk runs a law firm in Idaho that specializes in tribal representation.<br>  <br>  But that record isn't enough to convince Scott Crowell, another attorney, that EchoHawk is the right man to serve as assistant secretary of Indian affairs. After word of the potential nomination spread among tribal leaders who were in Washington, D.C. last week for Obama's inauguration, Crowell accused EchoHawk of not being committed to Indian Country.<br>  <br>  "I urge you to look behind the euphoria of the new administration, and the great respect that rightfully belongs to the EchoHawk name, and look at the specific facts regarding this specific man, and call upon the Obama administration and [Interior] Secretary [Ken] Salazar to choose someone other than Larry EchoHawk for this important position," Crowell, whose law firm exclusively deals with tribes, said in an open letter.<br>  <br>  The missive drew a quick response from the Shoshone-Bannock Tribes of Idaho. A letter from Chairman Alonzo Coby on behalf of the tribal council cited EchoHawk's long history in Indian issues, including his work for the tribes as their general counsel and his tenure as Idaho's top law enforcer.<br>  <br>  "As Attorney General, he supported legislation and efforts to protect native religious freedoms, salmon treaty fishing rights, and other legal matters impacting tribal sovereignty," Coby stated. "While Attorney General, Larry also lead efforts to improve state-tribal relations through the Conference of Western Attorneys General."<br>  <br>  The debate centers on EchoHawk's stance on Indian gaming, an issue that falls under the BIA. According to Crowell, EchoHawk pushed Idaho lawmakers to change a state law in order to avoid negotiating a Class III gaming compact with tribes.<br>  <br>  "Imagine that, while at the table with a federal obligation to negotiate in good faith, Larry EchoHawk instead headed up the extraordinary effort to change Idaho law to deprive tribes of their federal and inherent rights to operate Class III games on their lands," Crowell wrote in a second letter.<br>  <br>  In EchoHawk's defense, Coby said the attorney general has a "legal and ethical duty" to provide his legal advice on state issues. "He did this according to his oath of office, and he did not advocate against Indian gaming specifically at any time," the Shoshone-Bannock leader said in response to Crowell's initial criticism.<br>  <br>  With Indian gaming a $27 billion business, it's a big issue at the Interior Department. In addition to approving land-into-trust applications for casinos, the BIA must review all gaming compacts and, in some cases, can step in and help a tribe when a state fails to come to the table.<br>  <br>  In Idaho, Republican lawmakers have never embraced gaming despite court rulings in favor of tribes and strong backing from state voters on ballot initiatives. Former Interior secretary Dirk Kempthorne, a Republican, finally negotiated and signed four Class III gaming compacts after he became governor in 1999.<br>  <br>  It's not known when Obama will announce his pick to lead the BIA. Although Ken Salazar, a former senator from Colorado, was quickly confirmed as Interior Secretary, the new president still has to fill other top posts at Interior.<br>  <br>  Salazar spoke to over 400 tribal leaders last week before the inauguration and said they would be "very proud" of the BIA nominee. He indicated that Obama already made a decision about the post.<br>  <br>  John Echohawk, of NARF, served on Obama's transition team, helping the new administration with Indian issues at Interior.|`|a2aafb60224488f9314dfd227d2cdb18aa	What secretary?

The government isn't the economy. We aren't in a recession because the government isn't taking in enough tax money. Under the Bush tax cuts, the economy boomed from 2003 to 2006, even to the point of setting record highs for money taken in by the Federal government. With taxes low, businesses grew and thus surrendered more money to the Feds. I'm not sure about the "flat" tax, but the "fair" tax would have a tremendous positive impact on the economy. Taxes are a huge overhead for business. Remove that and you automatically streamline. It has been estimated that prices would drop about 25% on retail because of it. True, sales tax would be higher than they are today, but only on new items and they wouldn't be 25%.<br>  <br>  So I don't see income taxes providing more stability, they are still a burden.|`|b32jC7pGaa	There is no such thing as a flat or fair tax.

e27a0140d6c769e130a863ab1952f2b9aa	I was in ROTC and was in the SMP program in an engineer company in missouri.  Yes it is all golden if done correctly.  To ensure that you do not get deployed with your unit, join ROTC first.  Once you are in then look into the SMP program.  I went to a Military Junior College and attended ROTC Basic at Fort Knox, KY.  The ROTC basic took care of the first two years of ROTC.  You may have to wait until you are contracted in your third year of ROTC before you are eligible for the SMP program.  For the best details, contact the military department at the local college for the best answers.  It has been about 20 years since I went through all of this.  I learned quite a bit.  I got paid as an E-5 in the National Guard for the time I attended drill and since I was "enlisted" I got a full issue of uniforms free.  Officers pay for their uniforms.  If you want to look into early commissioning, you can contact a military junior college recruiter and look into the program.|`|3caq6SFxaa	As above and while you are in the National Gaurd you can be called up and put on active duty so you might be "regular Army" for a while.  Too many college students joined the National Gaurd forgetting that, the one weekend a month and two weeks in the summer and look at how much you'll make plus scholarships, and got beiiten when they were deployed to Iraq; no being a college student will not get you out of it unless you are in the green to gold program which is after a period with the National Gaurd and is a selective program meaning you might apply and get told that you can't do it.|`|2c1a8a9aabd32bac9934bcf7277144d8aa	you can only be on the SMP for two years,  but what you can do is get an active duty ROTC schoolarship for the first two years, then switch over for the last two|`|HCFPHlF4aa	When you join the National Guard you have to go to basic and AIT. Then after serving a little while (1 to 2 years) you can apply to the Green to Gold program and go to College ROTC and not be deployed and no you can't be paid by both and yes a kicker is a 1 time thing.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	To get the maximum benefits, you have to select an MOS and complete Basic and AIT in the Guard.  Once you have completed your MOS training and gone into school, you'll be getting your state (if available in your state) tuition assistance, Federal Tuition assistance (if your state doesn't offer it for the Guard).  If you do not do split option training (meaning you do basic and AIT concurrently, traditionally) you may be elligible for the College First program.  This gets you two years of non-deployability and maximize your income.  This will get you drill pay (I think starting pay is a little under $200, check www.military.com), the Reserve GI Bill of $329 a month and the College First GI Bill Kicker of $350.  (Note: The GI Bill Kicker is yours for four years, just like the GI Bill.  It is not a one time $350 payment)  That means over $800 a month in income during the school year.  You will get that for four years of school.  After your two years of college first, you will be approaching your Jr year and you can contract ROTC.  at that point, their contract will replace your Guard contract and you will begin getting their stipends which should increase your monthly in school income a little more.  You will be getting at least $4500 a year in tuition assistance, 100% if your state offers a program for the Guard.  There is no green-to-gold delay or whatever else.  With the Guard, you can begin ROTC immediately after completing your initial entry training.  The "catch" would be you most likely have to delay the beginning on your freshman year of college by 1 semester.  The enlisted experience with the Guard, the increase in pay scale (elligible for O-1E w/ 4 years service pay upon graduation), and the non-deployability until you have commissioned are, in my opinion, worth the initial time investment.<br>  <br>  There is another SMP program that let's you attend drill with the Guard or Reserves as a cadet, but you do not attend Basic or AIT and make a couple hundred extra bucks a month.  You're non-deployable in that scenario as well because you have no enlisted qualifications and you are not an officer yet.  You wouldn't qualify for the kicker, and I don't think you'd get the Reserve GI Bill, but you may still get Tuition assistance.  I can't remember all the ins and outs of that, you'll have to ask a current Guard recruiter.  I'm really tired but I tried to answer coherently.

They propose that the ‘non indigenous’ population should have their own segregated schools so that they can ‘learn about their own cultures’, the bottom line is of course ghettoization, and we can learn lessons from history by looking at what happened to the Jews in Nazi Germany here.  It is also worrying that the BNP advocate that citizens should be trained in the use of and allowed to own a gun but that the police would still be unarmed and the BNP say in their manifesto (page 24)<br>  “we will reverse the trend of recent decades whereby<br>  the State has sought to grant to the police a total monopoly on the enforcement<br>  of the law and acceptable standards of behaviour. This will entail changes in the<br>  law and the ‘culture’ of law enforcement.”<br>  Which sounds to me like a green light for vigilante groups.<br>  <br>  People who are considering voting BNP because of their immigration policy would be better off, after they have studied facts as opposed to propaganda, and still want tighter immigration controls, joining or forming a campaign to put pressure on the main political parties, likewise with other issues.  If they support the BNP because they believe they represent the interests of working people against big business they would be better off with the left-wing socialist parties and campaigns, and the Green Party for environmentalism.

Nah, they're not quite that bad. The BNP are the ones who turn up where there might turn out to be a racial flashpoint and apply a big spoon to stir the pot with. That's why they got 'encouraged' by the locals in part of Glasgow to leave when they started distributing literature while the Kris Donald murder trial was on. They thought the white Glaswegians would be all up in arms because Asian blokes murdered a white kid; they failed to realise that when it's scum we're talking about up here, race, colour and religion become utterly irrelevant. Scum is scum, no matter what colour it is.<br>  <br>  Oh, by the way, the only people saying the BNP will be coming into power are the BNP members, voters and sympathisers.

dJ1cAGUEaa	Where would WE be without socialism?  We have many socialized programs.  Social security, medicare, medicaid, public infrastructure, education - the list goes on and on.<br>  <br>  Health care is a huge concern.  We could all fund it in much the same way as we do Medicare.  It'd be much easier on us all.<br>  <br>  I think socialism in pure form has many virtues. In its essence, the direct product of the recognition, on the one hand, of the class antagonisms existing in the society of today between proprietors and non-proprietors, between capitalists and wage-workers; on the other hand, of the anarchy existing in production.<br>  <br>  Life becomes less complicated when there are rules to follow.<br>  <br>  I look at our socialized neighbor to the north (Canada) with admiration.  Sure, there are problems, but it's a great country!  So are the Nordic countries!  So is the UK.<br>  <br>  Capitalism is a wonderful idea but at this time, it has gone the same way of the communistic ideals of Russia.<br>  <br>  A few corrupt people made a lot of money off the whole of us and we're hurting because of it.  And while it burns us who have always followed the rules, that we must help those in need who have not followed the rules - it is because that concept is "Un-American".  (It wasn't always so in this country though.  There was time when people gathered in numbers to help each other survive.)   It's gone by the wayside in favor of "each man for his own" which went on to a type of primitive tyranny.<br>  <br>     Americans love rugged individualism and freedoms.  It is what the country was founded on.  It's too bad those freedoms have eroded because of the actions of those who have exploited, and taken advantage of "full protection" of them.<br>  <br>  Through that protection, they took full, unbridled and unconscionable advantage of it.  Is that American?  No - it is not.|`|yNBYhDyfaa	It's pretty damn obvious by what is transpiring in D.C. now.

Until there is no incentive left and no one to earn the money.<br>  <br>  But you need to really read the history of the Democratic Party to understand what their agenda is.  Conservatives did not cause this collapse. Yes, Bush added to the deficit but the real causes were made by Carter and Clinton.|`|jlXPsVfdaa	Neither.  There would never have been such a situation if the markets were truly free.

No individual, group, or government may initiate force against any other individual, group, or government. Our support of an individual's right to make choices in life does not mean that we necessarily approve or disapprove of those choices.<br>  <br>  1.1    Expression and Communication<br>  <br>  We support full freedom of expression and oppose government censorship, regulation or control of communications media and technology. We favor the freedom to engage in or abstain from any religious activities that do not violate the rights of others. We oppose government actions which either aid or attack any religion.<br>  <br>  1.2    Personal Privacy<br>  <br>  We support the protections provided by the Fourth Amendment to be secure in our persons, homes, and property. Only actions that infringe on the rights of others can properly be termed crimes. We favor the repeal of all laws creating "crimes" without victims, such as the use of drugs for medicinal or recreational purposes.<br>  <br>  1.3    Personal Relationships<br>  <br>  Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the rights of individuals by government, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws. Consenting adults should be free to choose their own sexual practices and personal relationships. Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict personal relationships.<br>  <br>  1.4    Abortion<br>  <br>  Recognizing that abortion is a sensitive issue and that people can hold good-faith views on all sides, we believe that government should be kept out of the matter, leaving the question to each person for their conscientious consideration.<br>  <br>  1.5    Crime and Justice<br>  <br>  Government exists to protect the rights of every individual including life, liberty and property. Criminal laws should be limited to violation of the rights of others through force or fraud, or deliberate actions that place others involuntarily at significant risk of harm. Individuals retain the right to voluntarily assume risk of harm to themselves. We support restitution of the victim to the fullest degree possible at the expense of the criminal or the negligent wrongdoer. We oppose reduction of constitutional safeguards of the rights of the criminally accused. The rights of due process, a speedy trial, legal counsel, trial by jury, and the legal presumption of innocence until proven guilty, must not be denied. We assert the common-law right of juries to judge not only the facts but also the justice of the law.<br>  <br>  1.6    Self-Defense<br>  <br>  The only legitimate use of force is in defense of individual rights — life, liberty, and justly acquired property — against aggression. This right inheres in the individual, who may agree to be aided by any other individual or group. We affirm the right to keep and bear arms, and oppose the prosecution of individuals for exercising their rights of self-defense. We oppose all laws at any level of government requiring registration of, or restricting, the ownership, manufacture, or transfer or sale of firearms or ammunition.<br>  <br>  2.0    Economic Liberty<br>  <br>  A free and competitive market allocates resources in the most efficient manner. Each person has the right to offer goods and services to others on the free market. The only proper role of government in the economic realm is to protect property rights, adjudicate disputes, and provide a legal framework in which voluntary trade is protected. All efforts by government to redistribute wealth, or to control or manage trade, are improper in a free society.<br>  <br>  <br>  2.1    Property and Contract<br>  <br>  Property rights are entitled to the same protection as all other human rights. The owners of property have the full right to control, use, dispose of, or in any manner enjoy, their property without interference, until and unless the exercise of their control infringes the valid rights of others. We oppose all controls on wages, prices, rents, profits, production, and interest rates. We advocate the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of prices, products, or services. We oppose all violations of the right to private property, liberty of contract, and freedom of trade. The right to trade includes the right not to trade — for any reasons whatsoever. Where property, including land, has been taken from its rightful owners by the government or private action in violation of individual rights, we favor restitution to the rightful owners.<br>  <br>  2.2    Environment<br>  <br>  We support a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of our natural resources. Private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining natural resources. Pollution and misuse of resources cause dama|`|y4yVmcOVaa	Libertarians do not believe in abolish government. The American Libertarian party has a well set out policy of limiting the scope of government more in the conservative tradition.  Other libertarians may have different views about the proper scope of government, but abolishing it completely would be anarchism- not libertarianism.<br>  <br>  As far as the corporate elite problem, it seems like many libertarians apply the idea of small government to business as well.  A lot of libertarian ideas focus on small business and limiting the scope of corporate entities, which also serve to limit individual liberty.<br>  <br>  With regards to being taken seriously, the American Libertarian party is among the most successful of all third parties.  It is not uncommon for Libertarians to win office in local elections around the country.<br>  <br>  For information on the American Libertarian party, check out their platform: <a href="http://www.lp.org/platform" rel="nofollow">http://www.lp.org/platform</a>  .|`|bgoxnyUMaa	Libertarianism is not.

As times changed, their conditions didn't change as promised, they started voting democrat, because the whites started voting republican, which continued for many years and then came the civil rights movement of the '50/'60's. Under a republican regime they fared better and began voting republican mainly because the white southerners started voting democrat again. <br>  I know this is not true in some places but it is in many. I have lived all over the south for many years and have seen these changes first hand.<br>  In Missouri this year the vote was split nearly down the middle, with the cities of K.C. and Saint Louis going almost solid democrat but the rural areas went republican.

Go outside of Y!A, and you will find thousands of websites dedicated to the fact that many regret voting for him. Those people, I can respect. Instead of blaming it on the other side when the crap hits the fan--they choose to see the facts, unite with others and try to do something about it. However, on this site....you wouldn't know it. I have no problem with someone if they sincerely believe he is the best man for the job. The problem I have is the blind loyalty that somehow has turned a lot of his followers into loyal warriors hell bent on discrediting anyone who speaks out against him.

That was the time when 'this is a failure' was reaching its crescendo. With all the missteps the previous administration made (success could have come a lot sooner with out some major blunders) they had to oppose what was happening. I think it is typical that you haven't heard not one say that they were incorrect in their thinking.<br>  And what should be understood is that Afghanistan has a greater chance to become more like Vietnam than Iraq ever did. <br>  The current administration is now committing more troops to that effort. <br>  Without any viable industry (poppy cultivation excluded), with infrastructure that is so far behind (not in need of repair but never there to begin with) where Iraq was, where tribal loyalties and local chiefdoms have so much more power and influence over the population than in Iraq, that unless tens of trillions of dollars and dozens of years are committed a viable central government will probably not succeed. And until there is a viable central government that can support itself both financially and politically, the Al-Qaeda and Taliban will eventually return possibly with even greater influence over the local population.|`|A5RunUIkaa	Successful elections?

There is still no national party that cuts across ethno-sectarian lines. <br>  <br>  Also, looking back at Iraqi history, both the Kurds and the Shia have repeatedly revolted against Sunni-dominated governments. <br>  <br>  Although the government is now Shia-dominated, the recent, dramatic sectarian violence between Arab Sunnis and Shia has left deep suspicions between the communities and has resulted in ethnically cleansed and walled-off enclaves for each sect. <br>  <br>  In the north, provincial elections in the volatile and oil-rich province of Kirkuk had to be postponed because the area has been a powder keg of rival Kurds, Arab Sunnis, and Turkomen. <br>  <br>  So don't live in a 'fool's paradise' because this election has done nothing to wipe away deep historical fissures nor an artificial country physically divided among ethno-sectarian groups.<br>  <br>  Although Saddam was a despot, during his 'reign' he managed to keep the 'hornets in the hive' and Iraq 'worked' as a fairly successful country for the majority of its citizens ... Bush's interference destroyed the 'hive' and unfortunately, not withstanding this supposedly 'successful' election, the 'hornets' are still at large ... with the probability of death and destruction still in their sights.|`|9w9UHyCNaa	They are reporting successful elections, where have you been? <br>  <br>  And just because the elections there are successful, doesn't mean Iraq was successful.

The administration does not want anything positive coming from Iraq...although we will not know until our troops are withdrawn whether or not the efforts have been a success. If it is done to soon (like Obama wants to do), it is likely that the insurrectionists will cause a lot of problems and possibly topple the new government. Iraq has stated that they want us out by 2011...and frankly, I think we should stick to that. I do think however that it would be wise for us to pull our troops away from the most dangerous areas and let the Iraquis themselves do the policing of those areas. After all, they will ultimately have to assume the full responsibility so why not give them some practice. I know that some areas are already under total Iraqui control...but if we want to pull our troops within 16 months, it is better to pull them no further than what is necessary so they will be available if the insurrents make a bid for the country.|`|u23sBafTaa	You are right, they are not about to report anything that would reflect well on Bush !

c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	Assuming you will be an officer, as enlisted guys aren't engineers but technicians.<br>  Not really, but there are a few jobs where blue-suiters write code.  Again, most of that stuff is handled by civilians (either DOD or contractor).  You are more of a manager/supervisor.  Those jobs also are not normally considered good for promotion-and tend to get schwacked in drawdowns.  Keep in mind that you don't join as a "Computer Scientist" you would join as a Comm/Computer systems officer: which could mean you're working on Tactical UHF networks to call in airstrikes instead of wearing blue-suits in an office...<br>  In the military "Engineer" is a very distinctive specialty.  There may be places where Computer Engineers write code: Wright-Patt, EDIT:  Meant Hanscom AFB sorry RADC is pretty much shut down, SSC to name three-but that is not their primary job.<br>  In your specific example, the AF doesn't do that.  That is handled by defense contractors-if you wish to work in that world, that would be your best bet.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	You heard correct for the most part.

P055DfvBaa	I just took my psych for the CHP last week.  One piece of advice that I can give you, is dont listen to what others are going to tell you.  I know it sounds weird, but I had friends that went through the psych with other agencies and I went into mine thinking it was going to be like what they had gone through.  It was'nt.  Just know that it will be nerve racking and you will be nervous.  I would review your entire application packet and your background just to refresh your mind about certain events in the past. I stumbled on a couple of guestions about my past because it was a fast interview.   Also be ready to answer questions from the MMPI test that you took.  Stay alet and stay focused.  He will throw questions at you quick and fast so make sure you listen to what he will say.  Every department is different.  It may take 15 minutes, it may take 30 minutes.  It just depends on the interviewer. Remember, they want to see how you act under pressure.   I know that when I was done, I felt like I had been hit by a truck.  Now the worst part is waiting the month to get my results.  Good luck.|`|ct3FueuAaa	Seriously there is ONE question.

This is not unusual, since much of Europe has already done this years ago.

JOXQrsw0aa	Do NROTC. It will pay full tuition regardless of amount. Many universities offer nrotc mids free room and board. If your school does not have NROTC, transfer to a school that does.  I wonder if you will think you are doing more when instead of expanding your knowledge in college you are chipping paint, swabbing the deck or cleaning the head. And berthing with 100 or more guys in the same room with absolutely no privacy. Many of whom you cannot hold an intelligent conversation with. Your direct supervisor will not be an admirable  Captain and Professor of Naval Science that heads an NROTC unit and may be a loud mouthed petty officer who has  few  of the qualities an intelligent guy would imagine in his dreams of a father figure.

I wish I wouldve but that's neither here nor there.  Also look into the ROTC, that also looks good joining more strips, better pay, and the more will have to salute you LoL.  Andrew's right, try it and if not, depepnding on your credits you get extra strips when enlisting. So if you decide to join, you can get more strips depending on your credits amount.
ab0507069beb3cfdfdcee35075af07feaa	I always thought so. I spent 21 years in the Navy and always had good chow, especially on the ship (aircraft carriers). The best stuff is sent to the fleet first, shore stations get the table scraps (as it should be). It's my understanding that the Navy sends people to special schools to learn how to become actual chef's now; that should make things even better, eh?|`|VjVWw0x5aa	When I was in the Navy the food was not bad but the Marines had the better chow hall while I was stationed in San Diego.|`|m5J36D28aa	I've always heard that the Navy and Air Force have the best chow.

Not ME! roflmao|`|bcc62a4f188c1522006cc8ba2c7b102aaa	Of course. Me? Not so much. Hope in Obama was a convenient shortcut for the people tired of Bush and refusing to see the severity of the situation, ie the impossibility to get real change within the corrupt money driven duopoly. To anyone who really payed attention none of this comes as a surprise.<br>  <br>  Edit Obviously but Obama will never do that and that was always clear to me. You asked about hope. I don't do illusions and never had hope in Obama.<br>  Obama took office under conditions of a deepening worldwide financial and economic crisis. His economic policies, the major focus of his first 30 days in office, consist of a series of initiatives aimed at propping up the profit system and safeguarding the economic dominance of the giant banks and billionaire investors, at the expense of working people:<br>  ? The economic stimulus legislation, a $787 billion stopgap measure to prevent a complete collapse of consumer spending and state and local government. While business benefits from tax breaks and infrastructure contracts, and a large swathe of upper-income families get exemption from the Alternative Minimum Tax (worth more than $2,000 apiece), most working people will receive a miniscule $400 tax cut<br>  ? The second round of the bank bailout enacted last fall by the House and Senate (including Obama’s vote), which provides another $350 billion for the financial elite. Of this, the bulk is to be used in another round of cash handouts to banks, hedge funds and other lenders, including the launching of a Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF, which will underwrite $1 trillion in low-cost loans to major hedge funds and other speculators<br>  ? The auto bailout (using funds from the bank bailout), which will require, as a condition of new loans to GM and Chrysler, the destruction of the living standards fought for by generations of auto workers. Wages, pensions and health benefits will be gutted, while the United Auto Workers union will be retained as a police force directed against rank-and-file workers.<br>  ? The housing bailout, announced by Obama February 18, which provides relief to relatively few of the millions who are now or will soon face the threat of foreclosure. The measure is so carefully crafted to safeguard the profit interests of the mortgage lending industry that BusinessWeek magazine headlined its report, “A Mortgage Rescue Banks Can Love.”<br>  These facts rip to shreds the ongoing efforts of liberals like the Nation magazine to present the new government as an expression of popular opposition to Bush and the right wing. The Obama administration constitutes an effort, on the part of key sections of the ruling class, shaken by the failures of the Bush administration and the financial debacle, to delude the American people with vague rhetoric while the most intense efforts are made to safeguard the position of the financial oligarchy, both at home and abroad.<br>  The Obama administration demonstrates the impossibility of effecting any significant change within the existing political institutions and the two-party system. These are wholly dominated by two forces: the military-intelligence apparatus and big financial interests.<br>  <a href="http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb2009/pers-f23.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wsws.org/articles/2009/feb200...</a>|`|swiOhDo2aa	People forget the obvious truths:<br>  ...Obama is an American. He is in there to bat for the USA - not for truth, justice, equality or any other abstraction however respectable.<br>  ...Obama wants to be reelected in four years. That means that he has to appeal to a wider range of Americans than when he was in opposition.<br>  <br>  I was personally not surprised, though I was a bit saddened, when he announced that prisoners from Afghanistan will not necessarily be granted their human rights. <br>  <br>  It is still not too late to change tack. If he were to do what should have been done from the start and treat all prisoners from the war as - well, as prisoners of war - things would be better.<br>  <br>  They should be securely and humanely contained in decent accommodation, to be released at the end of the conflict. When a peace deal is agreed, they could go home. Until then, they could simply be imprisoned, under Red Cross supervision, with letters and comforts checked for contraband, but not interfered with.<br>  <br>  It would have left the hands of the USA a lot cleaner.|`|Iqt83k0daa	Me. I voted for him and I have never been more disappointed about another decision in my life. Not for the reasons in that editorial but for his spending. He SAID he was not going to spend wildly like the Bush administration did and the first thing he does is rack up more debt. He lied.<br>  <br>  To add a little salt to the open wound, he then decides to give those who are in jeopardy of losing their homes some federal funding so they won't. Well I'll be damned! So, my wife and I cut back on expenses and live by our meager means and others who did not are getting helped. This just doesn't pass the smell test. There is more to this than meets the eye.|`|XxUByikJaa	I am pretty realistic when it comes to Politics and Politicians .

Of the liberals, only one said he agreed with the stimulus bill, and only 2 others were happy with Obama thus far.  The rest (11) said they were disappointed.|`|2KNzw0Rbaa	He is not what I thought he would be.

A million years ago it wouldn't have mattered as there were not than many people.  Now there are six or more billion of us.  A small change in climate can have massive effects on agriculture, rainfall and ocean levels.   Proof of rapid climate change is obvious if you check out what the US Navy has incorporated into its 21st century forward planning.  They're planning, along with Canada, Russia and other northern European countries for an ice free artic ocean.  Do you think they would do that if climate change was a hoax?  The oil industry likewise has plans to drill under the artic ocean just as soon as the ice clears from favorable spots.  None of these people give a hoot about the 'liberal left' or anything of a political nature....The military cares about military matters and commercial interest care about money.

Liberty "University" advertises its censorship of anything it defines as "liberal" and discriminates against anyone who challenges their ideas.<br>  <br>  That's NOT a smear--the administration at Liberty U advertises this policy publicly.

These gases can come from waste from a car and things like that. <br>  <br>  Also, if you look at the North and South Pole, the temperatures there have gotten significantly higher resulting in the deaths of polar bears and other animals because the ice is melting.<br>  <br>  Global warming doesn't always have to be the "warming" of a climate either. It can cause places all over the world to get colder or warmer. That could explain the extremely harsh winters in places around the equator.|`|SR6jnjdIaa	Well, first of all, there is very hard evidence that there is more CO2 in the atmosphere and other greenhouse gases. Also, even if you think this is not man-made, and its just a natural cycle of the earth, look at how polluted the earth is getting. <br>  Also, id like to see the evidence you have that its just a hoax to get votes, then i might think about believing you.|`|Ku5EIzamaa	I learned just enough about science in high school to hold suspect any scientist who is "certain" about what the future holds.<br>  <br>  If you indeed have an extensive science background, then you would know that declaring something to be "without a shadow of a doubt" requires more than what either side of the argument is offering.<br>  <br>  Perhaps there is global warming, man-made or otherwise. Perhaps there isn't. We will not know what the temperature is going to be 25 years from now until 25 years from now happens.

Winter, fall, SUMMER, and spring.<br>  It's obvious that global warming is a load of crap.|`|XNFvoIGxaa	Global warming is exactly that, and no it's not 100% scientifically proven. Al Gore the POLITICIAN I repeat POLITICIAN, released his video using half the info from digs that the video below used. He ommitted to include vital peices of information. In other words he spoke half truth to get votes. The Earth simply goes through stages. Man made green-house gases represent only a minute percent of greenhouse gas.<br>  The biggest contributors to the greenhouse are a: The sun and especially solar flares... b: Falling rotting leaves, and c: The ocean being the biggest contributor.  The idea of Global warming came from a crackpot scientist in England who Prime Minister Margeret Thatcher endorsed to help push for nuclear power to stop the coal miners strikes.<br>  The Earth isnt actually getting warmer on a whole. Summers are getting more intense but shorter due to increased solar activity. At the moment we are in the wake of a huge solar flare that will last a few more years. Antarctica is indeed melting in its usual cycle (Approximately 1000 years) but the glaciers in New Zealand (under the worst part of the ozone hole) are actually growing. Winters are becoming more intense and longer in many regions. So I can see how there is global warming. <br>  In fact in most industrial revolutions in the last 2 centuries, the times that were more polluted heralded colder bleaker weather because there was more of a barrier from the sun.<br>  If you watch the video `the great global warming swindle', you also discover that 2000 scientists were approached and asked if they would put their names to the global warming theories. Those who refused were put on the list anyway because they had been approached.<br>  Global warming is an industry bigger than all the national sports and international sports income combined. <br>  The revenue created by this industry internationally way surpasses the US national debt pa. Of course theyre going to keep trying to convince people to back them.<br>  Global warming nut-cases are ruining this world. In Victoria Australia, Globalists prevented the government from back burning forests. Now the whole state is burning and people are dying. Global warmists should learn that there are limitations to what is feasible and what is dangerous...Like fanatics, they don't really care. In the last fortnight, 200+ have died because of global warming fanatics. I'm not talking third world countries in civil war, I'm talking people like you and your neighbours, that have worked all their lives to have a good life. All dead because global warmists and their rotten ideas.<br>  And all because Al Gore released a movie based on half truths to get votes.

Massive unemployment, and home losses?|`|Z9jtdw17aa	Actually printing money is a problem when inflation is the threat, but right now, with the economy contracting, deflation is more of a threat, so printing money isn't as bad as it normally would be.<br>  <br>  As to the question of the headline, it depends on the particular job.  If it is building bridges, then obviously when the bridge is built, the location won't need another one.  However, if the construction company is able to survive the down-turn, it will be around to make jobs through growth in the economy, as it did before this downturn.  If the job is in the green economy, that will continue, since the need for green technologies is only going to grow.  The problem with starting those businesses with no public support is that private industry usually looks to the annual report, or even worse the quarterly report, for the "bottom line."  Those one year or even three month increments where someone doesn't turn a profit is too much for most investors.  That's why the government had to intervene after Katrina.  The "Bottom Line" just wasn't there until government guaranteed payment for things like hauling off trash and clearing building sites that the land owners or local businesses just couldn't afford, but they had to be done before the land owner or local businesses could start over.<br>  <br>  The idea behind the stimulus is that when the money runs out, the economy will be strong enough to generate its own money.  It's like a transfusion.  Without it, the patient will die or be very sick for a prolonged period.  With it, recovery will be faster.  Ultimately, the goal is that the patient is restored to health, and makes his own blood.|`|XxUByikJaa	Creating Jobs is a generating force . And actually Money really does not represent resources or goods accurately. Money is just a tool and symbol of trade . All the resources,  Labor , Goods etc. still exist in abundance .

I think Carter missed a chance to make a point and establish a new tradition by  pardoning Ford as his first official act as President. Think of the way the French Revolution went bad with the executions afterwards with each splinter party trying to execute the one before in order to hold power. This is also why I believe we should not put Bush and Cheney on trial.

The Democratic party has not made any in-roads in working in this issue, but several state and local groups have.<br>  <br>  Stimulus Plans:  Democrats tend to support stimulus in different ways than Republicans.  While Republicans would rather lower taxes, Democrats prefer to have government spending used to spur the economy.  This is a result of the New Deal policies from the Depression and is the major source of departure from the Democrats and liberalism.<br>  <br>  Taxation:  Democrats tend to prefer graduated tax plans, which mean that poorer people pay a smaller percentage of taxes and richer people pay higher percentages.

And droughts are hardly within the control of the population or the leadership.<br>  The California population voted to limit social services and education be limited to legal residence population. The ballot measure passed but was declared unconstitutional. The Government had done little to stem the flood of illegal immigration. It would be "bad" for the U.S. businesses who have cut their expenses by using this cheap labor instead of legal residence population. Even the fence that Bush had promised to build (not that it would have done very much good) has never been built. So is it not unfair to punish the population of these States for what the Government refuses to do to secure this countries borders?

Demand classes on American culture in the Mexican school system. Demand a local Mexican driver license. <br>  <br>  This will afford other legal rights and will go far to legitimize your unauthorized, illegal, presence in Mexico Drive around with no liability insurance and ignore local traffic laws.

Pro choice means women should have the choice to abort, adopt, or become a parent.  The first time she got pregnant she might have felt scared, angry, upset, etc.  She might not have felt she was financially or mentally capable of carrying a pregnancy and having a baby.  <br>  When she finished her education, got married, and was financially stable she was totally ready for her first child..tried, was successful, was probably incredibly thrilled and excited, and then had a miscarriage.  Don't you see the difference in feelings in the different situations?  That's not hypocrisy.

Yet, when asked if she will help this poor, pregnant woman to pay for her medical costs throughout the pregnancy, she declines. When asked if she will help with labor and delivery costs, she declines. When asked if she will help with sex ed, family planning, contraceptives, and parenting courses, she declines. When asked if she will help to feed and care for the living child's medical needs, she declines. When asked if she will support the 3 million children already born who are living in foster care and who will need to be supported through her tax dollars until the age of 18, she declines.<br>  <br>  Are children only 'valuable' when they are in utero?<br>  <br>  There are an estimated 250 million children in this world who are 'unwanted'--in orphanages and foster care awaiting homes. 9 million children starved to death in 2008. While it is perfectly fine for you to care about fetuses, you are ignoring children in actual need of aid and help. If you want every single fetus to become a living child, then YOU will have to double your taxes to support millions of children....as women who have unwanted pregnancies are FAR more likely to neglect/abuse their children. That means that more employees will be needed for social services, more foster homes, more developmental and physical therapists, more adoptive parents, more screenings for drugs, background checks, and homestudies, more money for WIC, Medicaid, and foster care allowances. All of this would cost a HUGE amount of money....until all of these children are 18 years old.

There is no particular order, you will all have been told to get there at the same time so it depends on the list caller who is first.<br>  <br>  If you are pleading guilty, you probably don't need a lawyer which will mean you probably get on faster.

bgoxnyUMaa	Yes they are.  The reason they are growing so fast is because they have massive amounts of labor, tons of capital, and they've abandoned a lot of the main tenets of communism so they can advance in the world stage.|`|ZDyKFoinaa	They were never technically communist to begin with, they just called themselves communist same with the russians, cubans etc.  To be truly Communist (the way Marx envisioned) you must first have industry. none of the so-called communists had industry before they had revolution.  what they turned into because of this is various forms of totalitarianism and dictatorships were instead of the bourgeois controlling the capital the government did.  This is not communism according to Marx and he would have wanted a second revolution.  So part of the answer is yes they are still a communist country but only because that's what they call themselves.  Wealth isn't evenly distributed they have poverty and they have rich (something Communism shouldn't have).  The economic system in china is more like state run capitalism.  The major exception of coarse is Hong Kong were true capitalism reigns.  Their economy is growing because of their peoples willingness to make the worlds stuff.  Plus i personally think that given were china was a decade or two ago they had no where to go but up, not mention they have so many people that they can sort of do what they want.  They hosted the olympics because they made a bid to the Olympic commission and won.  then they met the financial requirements put for by the commission.|`|c2hfVjxgaa	They are communists but realized that they needed to be competitive with the world and have started adopting capitalistic ideas (meanwhile we are abandoning ours)|`|wdBY1fWaaa	Yes, they are still communist.

That is like if you don't have long distance service on your phone, and you get a call from a telemarketer that wants to save you money on your long distance. Since you don't have the service, you can't save money on it, UNLESS THEY FREAKING PAY YOU TO USE THE SERVICE!<br>  <br>  Fiscal Fact No. 54<br>  <br>  With the April 17th deadline for federal tax returns looming, Americans are sharply aware of their federal income tax liabilities. However, one aspect of federal income taxes they may not be aware of is the growing number of Americans who pay zero federal income tax after taking advantage of deductions and credits.<br>  <br>  During 2006, Tax Foundation economists estimate that roughly 43.4 million tax returns, representing 91 million individuals, will face a zero or negative tax liability. That's out of a total of 136 million federal tax returns that will be filed. Adding to this figure the 15 million households and individuals who file no tax return at all, roughly 121 million Americans—or 41 percent of the U.S. population—will be completely outside the federal income tax system in 2006.1 This total includes those who pay no tax, and those who pay some tax upfront and are later refunded the full amount of the tax paid or more.<br>  <br>  Who Are the Non-Payers? <br>  Using IRS data, we are able to create a profile of these individuals who are outside the federal income tax system. As Table 1 shows, those who file as single or head-of-household are much more likely to be non-payers. One-third of single filers pay nothing in federal income taxes, and almost two-thirds of those who file as head of household pay nothing. In contrast, just 22 percent of married filers are non-payers.<br>  <br>  Why do many single filers face zero tax liability? One reason is that single filers tend to be younger and earn lower incomes than married filers—especially single parents who file as head-of-household. As a result, married taxpayers pay roughly 75 percent of all federal income taxes, despite filing only 40 percent of returns.|`|CkwmXnHiaa	The small tax cuts are not for welfare recipents. They are meant to make the tax payer keep more money and spend more on themselves to "stimulate" the economy. No one is buying things like cars, furniture clothes etc.The rest of the taxes we pay go for welfare and other programs. If welfare recipients aren't working they aren't paying taxes. Taxes we pay are what provides them with welfare benefits, food stamps and Medicare. I'm sure you're smart enough to know that money doesn't grow on trees. It's coming from US. Oh by the way President Obama overturned the Clinton welfare reform, so there is no incentive for people to get off of welfare. I hope you don't mind supporting other people with your hard earned money but I mind. I don't mind helping but don't want to support them for generations while they reap all the benefits.|`|92ced9f9c476e4864883a72b7d1d4c07aa	Here is what I suggest, wait and see who gets tax cuts, watch the stock market for reaction to stimulus pkg (down down down. . . ) also see who get tax increases. <br>  By the way, what is the point to your question?

8bdDRKQ6aa	I have seen many of the postings on the TheirSecrets.info page.  Many of the posters who favored the death threats and proudly announced they were Catholics defended the wars.  How is it then that posters can here tell us that the Popes were against the wars?  I saw pages that documented the Jesuits there being reminded that Pope John Paul II was against the Iraq War.  They responded with the mental diagnoses, "Anti-Catholic" accusations and the tinfoil hat dilemma that would have stopped the most ridiculous wars of treason.  Most of the Catholics there were saying how the wars were necessary for freedom and then constantly gave brash insults to all who disagreed with them.<br>  <br>  The idea that Rome openly opposes something is never a proof of what she actually thinks nor the positions that she holds.  There is even a discussion with American soldiers on that website doing the same thing: attacking people who notice bold threats of death against billions of people merely for not being Catholic.  Links are right there on the home page.<br>  <br>  Why suffer on in confusion?  Look at the evidence.  Just as persistently as thousands of years Rome has not changed will propagandists on the internet persist in ranting lies.  You can usually detect them based on their lack of adherence to the issues in discussion.  It is best to go to the actual links and then make comment, for, if the Pope speaks against the wars but then her loyal followers all support it with reminders of the Pope's wishes not accomplishing anything, we may want to research on what the Papacy actually thinks.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/alt.religion." rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/group/alt.relig...</a><br>  christian.adventist/msg/77214feff568d5...<br>  <br>  Maude:  "Whether or not you realize it, we already control your nation.

And George Bush, who started the Iraq War, is a Methodist, so where's the Vatican there?  And the war wasn't started to kill non-Catholics.  It was started because we wanted their oil.

What, haven't we already found out that the Constitution of the United States is "outdated?"  What better can come from such conclusions than to take us back much further?  I mean what is the comparison between such threats and Timothy McVeigh, Ted Bundy, The Green River Killer and all other serial killers of the 20th century combined?<br>  <br>  All history in fact shows that only the militia of the Papacy can make such threats and can also not notice them from a civilized standpoint.

It's IRR (inactive ready reserves) which means you do nothing except maybe get called back like your brother.|`|fe57457146ff1608077b527bfec6f2dcaa	It can all be a little misleading.<br>  <br>  All US military service contracts are for a total of 8 years.  What is negotiable is how many of those 8 years are spent on active duty (or in active drilling status for Reservists).  If the website says 5 years, that's 5 years active duty and it's probably not negotiable as a minimum.  Medics require a lot of training and it's expensive.  They have to limit the revolving door in some way, not only for costs, but also to get a certain amount of active use from any occupation that requires a lengthy trianing time.|`|K8qAniReaa	For most rates in the Navy the minimum active duty time is 3 or 4 years.

Right now many people are having their service terms extended beyond what they initially signed up for.|`|NZuJR79oaa	There are contracts as short as 18 months, however you must read the fine print.  When I was looking into this years ago, I found out that all the contracts are for 8 years, The first part is active duty, and the rest is active reserves, which in wartime, is active duty.  <br>  <br>  If you are going to sign up, sign up for the longer commitment to get the full bonus.  Don't blow your money.

Y0ICuJa1aa	The title tells you why it was written..it is a declaration of independence. The colonials felt like they needed to do this to get badly needed help from France and possibly Spain.

It gave many examples of how the government of Great Britain had violated the rights of the colonists and so lost their consent. It then proclaimed that, as a result of this, the colonies were free and independent states. <br>  <br>  To be specific, there were two reasons for the Declaration: <br>  <br>  <br>  To declare to the world, that the British Colonies in America were declaring themselves an independent nation. <br>  <br>  To explain (by listing the grievences against the King) why the colonies were declaring independence. <br>  <br>  Have a great Sunday....|`|hZVhRjMPaa	lets see....to declare our independence from Great Britain.<br>  <br>  It is a statement of secession.
FKJaQXQLaa	Perfectly normal.  It is called the fear of the unknown.  Joining the military is a life changing event.  Either you are ready or you are not.  Look deep down inside yourself.  If this is something you really want to do, then go for it.  The military will be whatever you make of it.  Go in with an open mind.  Embrace what you learn.  You will not be alone in this.  Every recruit in your platoon will be in the same situation as you.  If you go in with a preconceived notion of what you believe the military should be and find out that it isnt like what you expect, then you may be in for a rough ride.  I loved my time in the USMC.  You will get to go places and do things that ordinary people will never get to do.  I climbed Mt. Fuji, in Japan.  Was on a small carrier at sea during a Typhoon, got rocked for 36 hours straight.  Got to fire some of the coolest weapons made, and got paid for doing all this.  Spent time in the arctic, tropics and desert.  You are young.  Get out and experience life.  Do some things that you will remember and cherish the rest of your life.  We all were scared when we first joined up, but that goes away rather quickly.  If this is something you have wanted to do, then go and do it.  You wont be disappointed.|`|pYRZcfsJaa	if your not 100% sure then you shouldn't do it|`|80f46f96ec87da284c65875f2a90422daa	It seems like your are just like most who join. Of course you are gonna be worried and afraid of "the "unknown". You are human. Just know that in your heart its what you want and it will happen. Do it 100% always and no matter what happens you know you didn't quit. Boot Camp is changeling but you wouldn't want to become a Marine if it was easy would you? Hell No!!! If that was the case you'd want to join the boy scouts. You gotta be a hard charger at all times and always lead!. You are ready and you should go. You want it dint you? Than Attackk with everything you got. Now talk to a recruiter and check out your options. Choose a job you would like to really do. <br>  Good luck! remember nothing in life is free. NOTHING!<br>  <br>        “Some people wonder all their lives if they've made a difference. The Marines don't have that problem.”|`|G19Fo9jYaa	joing the marines is most deffinately a sacrifise, and you have to remember what your sacrifising for. nobody can make the choice to join the corps but you, and a majority of people in it will say that it's the most difficult experience they've been through in they're life, but it was worth it. there's going to be times in the corps where you'll wanna quit, and you'll question if its' worth it. but the sacrifises you make, are nothing compared to what you gain in return. don't be scared. based on what you've said about your shape, and your reason for joining, you'll do fine. :)|`|HXIIbVN8aa	It is normal to feel some trepidation at entering a lifestyle which is new and different from what you have experienced. If you want to prove , to yourself, that you can handle it, go for it.<br>  If you're doing it to prove something to others, your family included, forget it. The Marines do not want nor need anyone who joins to prove something to others.<br>  Join to serve your country and to become a man and a Marine.<br>  Being accepted by them is a great honor which few achieve.<br>  Butterflies in the belly are normal and heathy.<br>  It means you think clearly.<br>  Take your time, think it out, talk to a Marine recruiter.<br>  My nephew chose the Navy and enlisted. After 4 years they sent him to college thru the NROTC. Now he is a Lt Commander in Naval Air<br>  and loves it.|`|eMXIQaQlaa	It would be smart to talk to a recruiter. They can tell you what you can expect and how things will work and what you'll have to do and then you can decide from there whether or not it's right for you. It's very normal tho, my boyfriend just recently decided to join and I support him, I'm sure he's nervous and he says he'll miss me and his family and friends but it's a good decision for him, he's talked to a recruiter a few times now and says they're very helpful.|`|HCFPHlF4aa	The military is not a waste of time. You will have respect, honor and a life time of memories. Also it looks good on Work and College Apps. Find something you'd enjoy the military and work towards it. Mine is the Army Rangers and I'm on my way to becoming one but it takes a lot of hard work.|`|lP04jzv6aa	change is scary. I would go talk to a recruiter and let them answer your questions then go and think it over. its not like joining a club or anything. it is life changing. Good Luck|`|rI9vdCYAaa	Honestly if your scared you can't be a marine... Not dissing or anything it takes a lot to be The Few, The Proud, The Marines.. That's why a lot can't be Marines ( The Tip of the Spear). Brother I think you will be fine after boot camp where they don't train or make Marine you are born as a Marine. If you have a family and you want to stay safe go with the Air Force or Navy ( I'm at the Naval Academy working my way to become a Marine or Navy Fighter Pilot or maybe a navy seal). Just saying why do you think when a Marine walks through the air port or walk to places people come up and shake their hands? Because they are the Brave men and women that fought for freedom and fought for liberty. They are the Few The Brave The Proud The Marines. They Know every time they wear that uniform they made a difference in the world and their country. Good luck on your mission of becoming a Brave Proud marine. If you do join the Marines or Navy I'll be your officer guiding you through trouble. HOO-RAH! GO NAVY BEAT ARMY! AND ALL!  TOP GUN!

aeiP74PLaa	did the police come to the scene and take a report?  if they did then the police report and officer can be proof.  They won't accept your witness because it could be someone you know or someone that was in your car.  Was there another driver involved? If so the company would call him and verify the date/time of the accident as well.  Also if you bought insurance after the accident online you should withdraw the claim because you'll be in a lot of trouble and then they go after you for making a false police report.

ivsKcwwvaa	Several major factors.  The U.S. government, and U.S. corporations had major financial investments in France and Britain. If fact, we were financing the war for them. So an invasion by Germany, would have devastated, possibly collapsed, the American economy.<br>  <br>  Another was a civil was had just ended in Mexico. We had troops there. The Mexican government demand we remove them., Most Americans wanted them out also. The fear was Germany would ally itself with Mexico. Sending troops back in was not an option. So defeating or at least weakening German forces and influence, was a better method.<br>  <br>  The deciding factor however was the sinking of the Lusitania. <br>  It was a  luxury liner cruise ship. A German  submarine fired and sank her, killing over 1000 civilians, over 100 Americans. It was somewhat like the "twin towers" attack on 9/11.

Not just an,  I think that the person did it and then so they are guilty and lets put them in prison.<br>  <br>  I believe that it is better to let ten guilty men go free,  than to send even one innocent person to prison for a crime that they didn't commit.<br>  <br>  If some one is found to have committed a crime then they should pay for that crime.  They should be sentenced to what ever our system deems right as their punishment.|`|0PmIz1Gkaa	You cannot punish someone based on nothing, of course the need for physical evidence is necessary to actually prove that the "perpetrator" committed the crime.<br>  Killing someone is never justified even if the criminals have done great evils. No one wants murder on their conscience, you have to learn to forgive even if you cannot forget.|`|AA10029188	I agree with you to a certain extent.  If there is no doubt a person committed a crime (DNA evidence, video tape, etc) then they should be punished according to the crime.  For murder, they should be given the death penalty.  And they should not get what the victims did not get.  No appeals.  No chance to say "good-bye" to loved ones.  No last meal.  Death should be by hanging, that is nice and cheap.  For rape, they should be castrated. (And if it is ever found out a woman lied about being raped and an innocent man was castrated, her tongue should be cut out and "LIAR" tattooed on her forehead. That should eliminate that chance.) Stealing: Make them work for and pay restitution for the REPLACEMENT value of what they stole.  Animal abuse: What they did to the animal should be done to them.  And prison should be just that - prison.  Not a country club atmosphere with a gym, cable TV, etc.

We do not have pogue Marines and we do not have female Marines and we do not have infantry Marines, we simply have Marines.<br>  <br>  To mess around with this is fun and good times, but when they are serious they get no respect.<br>  <br>  Watch this USMC video.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_beLE6K9XJw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_beLE6K9X...</a>|`|AOaHaRvBaa	Everyone who serves deserves respect.  Every MOS is important and needed.<br>  <br>  The Infantry are respected because their mission is to CLOSE WITH and destroy the enemy.  The infantry is expected to operate in almost any terrain, with little personal protection, and kill the enemy.  Infantrymen are constantly exposed to the elements and traditionally endure more physical hardship than the other branches.  They don't shoot at an enemy miles away like the artillery.  They don't have several tons of armor to protect them like the tankers.    <br>  <br>  The grunts are NOT the bottom of the Army.  Soldiers in the Infantry wear distinctive items on their service and dress uniforms.  The Army Infantry has its own badges separate and distinct from others in the Army.  Many of the Army's top generals and sergeant majors started in the Infantry.|`|FKJaQXQLaa	In the military, especially the infantry, every MOS respects the other.  I was a grunt in the USMC.  While we picked on each other alot, we respected the hell out of each other.  The AAVs gave us rides so we didnt have to walk all the time, the tanks came in and blew the hell out of hard targets, and the artillery blew stuff up for us at long ranges so we didnt have to deal with it.  So yes, they do get respect.  As a grunt we loved them.  We all worked together.  If we didnt do our jobs, then the tanks and AAVs will get killed because there will be enemy grunts with anti armor around.  The enemy will be able to overrun the arty positions.  We all helped each other out and did our jobs so that we all come home.|`|3caq6SFxaa	Too many people and especially those with no or limited actual experience with the military really make a lot more out of the "Army hates Marines" "Grunts hate everyone else" stuff then is actually their.  I served in the Marines as both infantry and later lateral moved to the Air Wing-we do ride each other but with the exception of a few, and usually very junior "boot campers", it is just that riding and joking about it.  Same is true of the rivalry between the services-you would notice most of the really "ignorant" answers here are people who never served, getting ready to go to recruit training or just got out of it with a strong emphasis on "Wannabees".|`|Q7ovix19aa	They do in the army.  Grunts were on the bottom there.  Think about moving over.<br>  <br>  Or wait until the grunts are pinned down and need fire support.  You'll be mighty important then.|`|HCFPHlF4aa	I've found units that are Mechanized are a little lazier than guys in Airborne, Air Assault or standard Infantry but still soldiers like me. <br>  <br>  I'm in the Airborne and we drop into a DZ carrying 80 pound rucks and have to hump it to our objective. I have no problem with them, they were the smart ones who chose the proper MOS.|`|llqFKBpAaa	Because they don't have to walk.<br>  <br>  Really, grunts are on foot and fighting the enemy face to face.<br>  Doesn't get more dangerous or difficult than that.
c34895fb3078ed6b839d8ec9443a9ab2aa	An E & E route is a pre-planned way to avoid capture and attempt to get back to friendly lines (or make contact with friendly forces).<br>  Rally points are designated places to meet, usually at a specific time.  This way if you get separated, you start moving to the closest rally point. That does two things. It lets everyone know where/when you'll be somewhere AND to start looking for you if you're late.  <br>  In your scenario, my "E & E" route would be to get a cab, and let the others know so they aren't waiting.  I would brief that to them, "If I'm not back at XXX by the rally time I'll execute my plan." <br>  If we were on a pub crawl, and guys went off on their own-the rally points would help gather folks together.|`|dVQdswtTaa	Escape and evasion
fe57457146ff1608077b527bfec6f2dcaa	Get over it.<br>  <br>  Congress has the right to delegate that authority, and has done so to the Fed, a wholly legislatively created entity.<br>  <br>  The Congress can change it any time they like.  The President has nothing to do with it aside from signing any bill to that effect.<br>  <br>  For those who have "gold standard" fantasies.  Going back to a gold standard, while it would impose greater discipline on the economy which would be a good thing, is impossible without triggering a for real global depression.  There's not enough gold in the world to back our present economy, let alone in US holding (unless we can get gold's price up to over $9000/ounce).|`|qEYYHNyyaa	Kennedy tried to with the silver certificates, backed by over 4 billion in silver.<br>  He was assassinated a few months later. Coincidence?|`|11dGXLchaa	First, saying that Congress has the "power" to do something means only that it may pass legislation relating to that power.   Legislation always incorporates a delegation of power.   Congress itself must delegate.    We could not have Congressman walking around the country collecting taxes or building roads.   It was never envisioned that Congress itself would print our money.   However, they have the power to pass laws controlling the printing of money.<br>  <br>  Second, the Federal Bureau of Printing & Engraving prints money, not the Fed.   The Fed receives the printed money and charges interest on that money which it loans to private banks.   The Fed charges varying rates of interest in order to expand or contract the money supply as circumstances warrant.   Under ordinary circumstances, this "monetary policy" prevents inflation from occurring, and inflation can damage an economy.|`|xMfMTRQDaa	Like has already been said, Congress has the power not only to create money themselves, but more realistically, to give another body that same power.<br>  <br>  The Federal Reserve does in fact not print money: that task is left to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, part of the Treasury Department.<br>  <br>  The interest rate that the Fed changes is on inter-bank loans, it does not directly affect the consumer, but is a way to manipulate the economy and try to have an effective monetary policy.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	You are right to be mad.

I agree with public places such as government buildings but not in privately owned businesses. As any bar, casino or adult oriented business. Adults can choose whether or not to patronize a business that allows smoking or not.  We already have a state wide ban and some bars and clubs have had to fire employees or close. Government should not infringe on private business.|`|0PmIz1Gkaa	1. It's bad for those who have to be around the smoker.<br>  2. Bad for the environment.<br>  3.

48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	The information you provide is really not sufficient to answer the question.  You cannot be cited to appear in court if you are not the person to whom a citation is issued.  However, Queenie is sort of right.  It is an infraction to allow an unlicensed driver to drive your car (Veh C 14604), but, as I say, I don't see how you could have been cited for that, but it is probably in your best interest to go to court if the citation says you must do so.  The far more serious problem is that your car can also be impounded for 30 days.  (That is what Veh C 14607.6 is about.)  You will want to get it out of impound ASAP, because impound fees are exorbitant.  <br>  <br>  The citation may have something to do with the impound, but you are supposed to have notice of that within 2 days and then a hearing within two days of demand, so I don't know where 60 days would come from.  From what you say, you don't have a defense to the impound, since you did knowingly allow an unlicensed driver to drive your car.|`|zrthZOCdaa	No, but somebody will have to pay the impound fees|`|AA10029188	Yes, you can and should be held responsible for allowing someone that you know does not have a license to drive your car.

BAH is based on DUTY station, not where your home is.  If you live in Base housing all your BAH is taken right back out as an allotment to housing.  you are only entitled to housing if you have deponents.  90% of the time you have the option to live in town if you choose.|`|6389fc55051a8e265f2d4105be69a514aa	First, if you enlisted in the Navy Reserve you might find it VERY difficult to go Active Duty.

This is definitely a good idea if you are of low rank with several dependents. If you live off base you will Receiver BAH with dependents according to the location you are stationed.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Okay.  I won't answer the Navy based questions, because I honestly have no idea.<br>  <br>  BAH is Basic Allowance for Housing. It's to provide you enough money to cover the cost of a residence off base.  If you live on base you do not receive it, since they are providing you with a home.<br>  <br>  If you are single and are authorized to live off base (because they don't have room for you in the barracks) you will get single rate BAH.  If you are married, you will get BAH with dependents.<br>  <br>  BAS is Basic Allowance for Sustenance.  You receive that any time you do not eat in the dining facility or on the ship.  So if you are married, you will receive it as long as you are not deployed (at least that's my understanding, that the Navy doesn't give you BAH while deployed)<br>  <br>  Oh and you don't get any extra money for children unless you live OCONUS (Outside of the Continental United States) and receive COLA (cost of living allowance).

Too many people have changed their buying habits and are finally cutting back to what they believe is a sustainable life style in hard times. That is what is known as a self-fulfilling prophecy.

261e200ff9afed850c06278f61c34b85aa	Up to the point where Obama ran for president, politicians from Illinois had a good record. The first president from Illinois, Lincoln, was a Republican and he freed the slaves. Obama will tax us into slavery, he will spend us into bankruptcy and he will continue to refuse to drill for oil domestically so more oil dollars will fall like manna from heaven into the hands of terrorists who are, right now, plotting to destroy more American lives. The First President from Illinois freed the slaves, the second president from Illinois will make us into tax slaves - go figure.|`|2kgTdNRQaa	Because he is better than the aged, confused senator from Arizona, whose brain is about as arid as the desert.|`|m5J36D28aa	I like him because he wasn't stupid enough like McCain to say on camera several times that he knew nothing about the economy and that he planned on invading more countries with our troops.|`|9w9UHyCNaa	Obama isn't just an Illinois politician.

Just for insurance, don't let anyone read it before the vote.<br>  <br>  This is a devious stroke of genius. Pork barrel politicians are now the good guys and they get all their worthless projects passed at one time. They can even give their contributors big government projects.<br>  <br>  There is no risk if everything goes bad, they can just blame everything on Bush who really set himself up by making some poor decisions.<br>  <br>  I do not know if this is Obama's idea or not.

2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	I've gone back and forth on this most of my life, and finally looked at the death penalty system in action.  A lot of what I found surprised and disturbed me.  Sources below.<br>  <br>  Most disturbing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, can’t guarantee we won’t execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.<br>  <br>  A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.<br>  <br>  Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative. <br>  <br>  Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty. <br>  <br>  The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that don’t.<br>  <br>  There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.<br>  <br>  The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?<br>  <br>  Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Sources:<br>  <br>  Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.<br>  <br>  FBI   <a href="http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/table_04.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2006/data/tab...</a>  <br>  <br>  The Innocence Project, www.innocenceproject.org<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcosttestimony.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/COcostte...</a> page 3 and 4 on why the death penalty is so expensive<br>  <br>  And, for statements of victims’ families:<br>  <a href="http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statements.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nyadp.org/main/70308Statement...</a><br>  www.mvfhr.org and www.mvfr.org|`|w2LKUYWMaa	First of all, I think that our first concern should be that life should be protected for both the victims and those guilty of the crime.  With that in mind, I believe that though the death penalty is a valid action of the state as a fitting punishment for heinous crimes and as a possible deterrence factor, but I think (from a Biblical perspective) that it is best to exercise grace whenever possible and that it should not just be an option we jump to whenever we are mad.  It is a serious business in the taking of human life, and it should not be taken lightly.  But, in the end, it is my opinion that the state has a right to exercise the death penalty in EXTREME cases.|`|xbez1qBPaa	I'll save you alot of blabber about it not being a deterrent. <br>  It obviously is a deterrent:That particular savage is guaranteed never to hurt another soul again.<br>  <br>  In short: They should install an electric couch. That way we could off the animals three at a time!|`|c2hfVjxgaa	No question that the offender won't offend again if he is executed.  Justice for the victims!|`|YTasscmKaa	There are some people who deserve the death penalty. I'm not talking cases where there is a doubt or your "average" act of violence. People like Ted Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffery Dahmer, for instance, who should be executed for their crimes.

It was done to break the bank of the confederacy because at that time slaves were a valuable commodity and traded like any other commodity.<br>  The effects are far reaching and well beyond the scope of what I can even begin to write here, but it did change our fundamental beliefs and values as a nation. There is no doubt about that.|`|MB1oT04maa	he was losing the war...so he freed the slaves to fight for the north|`|ezQ44NqAaa	What did Lincoln do?For one,he killed the entire concept of States Rights,and buried over 500,000 Americans with it,after what was the most destructive War to the US in it's History.By doing so,he took all of what were our Founding Fathers worst nightmares regarding the Federal Government,and made them come true.<br>  <br>  The Slavery issue is secondary really,after all it was a dying institution anyway.Because as we advanced,slaves would have become less and less valuable.Any advance in farming,like any machinery,would make the slaves less valuable as a work force.And even in the South,sentiment about whether slavery was acceptable was slowly turning against it.It would have died out naturally no matter what,and we could have avoided the scars of the Civil War,and the decades of violent racism that followed it.<br>  <br>  Oddly enough,even the "Great Emancipator" Lincoln,didn't really think much of the slaves.He thought they should be sent back to Africa,because while he opposed Slavery he didn't really believe we could live together.So much for the myth of this great humanitarian.<br>  <br>  AD|`|QCEHA6d6aa	Abraham Lincoln (Republican) is known for the emancipation proclamation which freed the African Americans from slavery during the U.S. civil war between the United States of America and the Confederate States of America.<br>  Jefferson Davis (Democrat) was appointed at the Confederate President. The southern states broke away from the union because they didn't want to have the Federal Government controlling the State Governments in regards to slavery.<br>  Even though the Union won the war they had to compromise with the southern states about African American rights. This issue didn't get resolved until after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.<br>  Well to answer your second question I think slavery was doomed to fail anyway (Oppression leads to revolution).|`|ilzMZNTtaa	On January 1, 1863 the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect. This was Lincoln’s declaration of freedom for all slaves in areas of the Confederacy not under union control.<br>  <br>  What made him a strong leader was his faith.<br>  <br>  Considerable uncertainty arises... when Lincoln's own religion is examined... it is obvious that Christianity exerted a profound influence on his life. His father was a member of Regular Baptist churches in Kentucky and Indiana. Lincoln himself read the Bible throughout his life, quoted from it extensively... during his years as president he did regularly attend the New York Avenue Presbyterian Church in Washington.|`|akvrwpywaa	He violated the Constitution and waged war against his own people.<br>  And most historians agree he was the greatest President our great nation ever had.  (He was also the first Republican president.)<br>  He also freed the slaves, which went against what the Democrats stood for.|`|hZVhRjMPaa	Lincoln wanted to preserve the union and slavery was used to justify that.

While other countries depend upon the U.S. for exporting various products (agricultural goods, iron and etc.) and services. In general when one country's economy suffers the other countries that have business with them will also suffer. However there are some products and services that can't be exported or imported. <br>  A country that is loosing economic growth because of another country's economic collapse will often find another country to trade with to make up for the loose of income.|`|fe57457146ff1608077b527bfec6f2dcaa	Globalization is the reason that economic consequences, good and bad, in one country are felt in many other countries.

Its easy to hide in an allies country where the US can't interfere in. Recently during the Gaza war with Israel, there was a footage sent by Osama Bin Laden calling for a Crusade against Israel, but it is not known if it's actually him or not in that footage.|`|bvUkgXsHaa	I'm convinced he's dead. How and why I'm convinced... well it's a long story.<br>  <br>  But both sides need him to seem to be alive.<br>  <br>  Naturally the terrorists need him to seem alive because he's their rallying point. If he were to die, he would have to go down in a hail of "infidel" bullets. Then he would be a martyr... and we'd be fighting him for a hundred years. I'm willing to bet that, when he was alive, he had one of his cronies standing by with a US weapon loaded with US bullets, so, in the event he was in CQC, they could put a few bullets in him and make it appear we'd taken him out. But he died of natural causes -- probably from kidney failure. That doesn't serve their purpose. So, every once in a while they borrow from Hussein's bag of tricks and put a double in front of the camera and play a doctored excerpts from OBL's old rants, or fool enough with the sound to make identification impossible... and that keeps him alive in the minds of the people.<br>  <br>  Oddly, the US government needs him to seem alive for the same reason... he's a rallying point. He's the ultimate "bad guy." We have a bunch of wimpy so-called Americans who think the phrase, "When the going gets tough, the tough get going," means "When the going gets tough, leave." They're chock full of platitudes and epithets they direct at people with common sense. But they generally want to "get Bin Ladin." That's all they know about the war. Now the US has a job to do. The government's spent a lot of money... and the lives of a lot of soldiers and sailors... trying to get the job done. They only have to hold the wimps at bay for a little longer. So, they appeal to limited intellect with, "We really need to get Bin Ladin." If Bin Ladin were to die, before the job was done, the limited intellect of those so-called Americans would demand immediate unilateral withdrawal... whether the job's done or not. So, they're glad when the terrorists throw out another OBL "bone" (tape). "See," they say, "he's still alive. We still need to get him."|`|47ddda29b6896ce72acab50c6bef43fdaa	I doubt UBL is dead. He's just in hibernation. He realizes attacking America or anyone else right now, with a president with a Muslim surname, would be detrimental to his image.

W93nvnY2aa	For one thing, the $780 Billion "stimulus" package would not have been nearly as large. It would also have had more in tax cuts for "common" wage earners in this country.<br>  <br>  This would also mean  a much lower deficit to have to deal with in the future. Obama's plans have already doubled the deficit from what it was when Obama took Office. The deficit is only going to rise until and unless Obama makes good on his promise to control wasteful spending.<br>  <br>  Jason is on the right track. Clinton did away with the deficit because he had a Republican Congress willing to hold down spending. Not only that, but they did control wasteful spending. Don't be too quick to give Clinton total credit for what Republicans did between 1994, and 2000.<br>  <br>  We also can look to the past to see what will happen with a Liberal Democratic President, and a Democratic controlled Congress. Look at the Carter years. This country has double digit inflation, double digit unemployment,  a top marginal tax rate of close to 70%, and a misery index, so the government could keep up with how bad Americans felt about life in America.|`|rephaDjLaa	We would've been screwed and nothing would get done. <br>  <br>  Basically, the Republicans would've made certain President Obama accomplished nothing during his term in order to regain the WH in 2012.|`|0s09peMQaa	He'd try to do whatever he wants by giving them a blank check like what happened with the dems.|`|3c91df9cab412a7ca4201cdaf64121e3aa	Honestly, if you hypothetical was in place, the GOP would be easier to work with.

Our friend Mr. Hannity barely belongs in this group.<br>  <br>  Part 3 : Corporatists - these guys are pretty bad news, presently heavy industrial representatives (coal, gas,oil, manufacturing, defense and banking industry guru's these guys were perfectly content to have arranged no taxation for their corporations decades ago, and have had politicians paying to develop "domestic" infrastructures so they don't have to pay to build them. <br>  <br>  While I'm all for distributing costs that benefit all (roads, schools , the internet etc), this is different in that they have used the GOP to turn the public treasury from a societal support system to one of private interest support where the public dollars benefits individuals and corporations with subsidy and tax dollars revenues.<br>  <br>  Discrete media control on stations like "Fox News" and our friend Mr. Hannity, means that the Johnny come-lately of Neoconservative thinkers which speak from "on high" over at Fox guys like Bill Kristol, Richard Perle, Paul Wolfowitz, Lawrence Franklin, who basically pimped the Gulf War on the US and have a hard-on for destabilizing as much of the middle-east as might be hostile to Israeli Likud &/or US corporate interests. Notably Franklin & Perle were or are under investigation for espionage. <br>  <br>  Part 4 : Religious Conservatives - clearly the group which was "brought along" for what they could offer the rest - electability.<br>  <br>  Ultimately - in so far as their religious convictions are only marginally represented - at best when the candidates themselves are evangelical or personally religious. They might have a firey speech or two, speak lovingly about the virtues of "Church and state, perfect together" , Intelligent Design, or whatever sounded good at election time, so there was alot of talk about religiousness but no real action on agenda items or at least no action that was particularly healthy.<br>  <br>  In 2006 when religious conservatives began to realize this they stopped voting , and the balloon busted for the GOP.<br>  <br>  The time has long come, however, when the conservatives, thinking deregulation and tax cuts will save us really cannot comport that ideal with the Keynesian Laizzez-faire apocalypse which occurred on Mr. Bush's watch. I'm sure they will try to say it was Obama-fatigue or whatever.<br>  <br>  From a fiscal perspective, at the moment, Republicans are unelectable in the near term. If they could however make an example of one state, where tax-cuts will "miracle" the economy back to competitiveness, while having "miracle away" the deficits of decades of "tax-cut" based policies. <br>  <br>  From a military perspective, the total failure of the previous administration to efficiently use our national power abroad to police  loose nuclear materials or biological materials or actually apprehend or kill Mr. Bin Ladin and company, to say nothing of the internal destruction of our fighting forces, by virtue of stop-loss, medical mistreatment in the VA, and other policies which kept soldiers and officers in harms way for YEARS longer than is prudent from a mental health perspective, to say nothing of boondoggle projects like missile on missile SDI projects.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, the scope and scale of decades of mismanagement , corruption and cronism caught up to the GOP. <br>  <br>  So 40 years out, what started with fiscal conservatism and an anti-war agenda has been totally corrupted. At a minimum what need to done is loose some of the BAD baggage and remember who they really work for.<br>  <br>  At a realistic level, it may very well be that the Republican Party more or less ceases to exist in it's present form for more than a few years, and breaks up into some variant of the parts mentioned above.<br>  <br>  I think that's a bad thing considering that now more than ever someone ne|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	They're not in exile until they go away, which means leaving the country.

IgVBVcibaa	I used to live in Whatcom County (Bellingham and later, Ferndale) for many years.  I was familiar with the barking-dogs law at the time, though it may have changed.  I can't imagine it would be more lenient, though.  If dogs barked continuously for more than approx. 5-10 minutes, it was considered a nuisance and could be reported.  If reported, animal control or the sheriff, depending on if you were in city or county, would come warn the person complained against.  After a few warnings, the dog or dogs could be taken away, fines are issued, etc..  It can also be reported as animal neglect or cruelty, as a dog barking enough to be a nuisance is not (or wasn't under Whatcom co. law a few years ago) considered to be properly cared for.  Some people end up calling authorities just to make sure the dog/s aren't injured or the owner hasn't abandoned them, or the neighbor's house is being broken into, etc.,  if dogs are barking too often.|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	You will get a ticket for disturbing the peace.<br>  <br>  I work nights and people dogs bark all day long.<br>  <br>  So I decided if my sleep gets interrupted, so will theirs.<br>  <br>  So I started using a ultrasonic dog whistle at nights on the weekend.<br>  <br>  I would use it to get every dog near me barking like crazy, about every two hours during the night.<br>  <br>  It didn't take long, before the dogs stopped barking.<br>  <br>  A whole lot of people decided to get rid of thier dogs, after thier dogs started keeping them up at night, instead of me up all day/.

Besides, they would have to know HOW MUCH profit they were going to make in order to cover the amount they will be taxed.  And the drivers of the nation have found some ways to save money already and use less gas.  You don't think we will see the prices reflect the drop in demand??<br>  <br>  Face it - in order to stimulate the economy one has to spend money.

wrLu93C9aa	50/50%|`|3woyz5ucaa	Possible. Here are a few possibilities.<br>  <br>  North Korea - Just left all peace agreements and cease fires with South Korea, and will test an ICBM missile which the US calls a provocation which I think the US should just leave N.Korea alone.<br>  <br>  Iran - Claimed today actually that it will start using its nuclear power plant which the US is also against (yet again, I think the US should just leave them alone).<br>  <br>  A low but very possible, a war with Russia over pure water and resources such as oil. Very low, but if it does happen then there is no survival.<br>  <br>  However, a new cold war is a very high possibility of happening. Although Obama said he will halt on putting missile defenses in Poland which in response Russia would place Topol-M nukes that can penetrate the shield, Russia isn't our largest concern, but China is. It is already almost confirmed that there will be a space race between the US and China. It was a possibility even before Obama was president since China is countering the ISS (Internation Space Station) with its own space station, and recently making its first space walk, Obama in January said he will fund NASA to land on the moon before China in around 2020. I really think its weird though since we already have a flag up there.|`|XA69SIvnaa	Very unlikely. IMHO the U.S. military is overstretched, particularly in the CENTCOM theatre of operations. Unfortunately (maybe fortunately) if we do end up in another conflict, I think the draft would be reinstated. Again, IMHO, it should have been prior to the 23 March 2003 invasion. DoD should have also put recruiting ceilings on the non-combat services like the Navy and Coast Guard so the Army, Marines, and Air Force (services actually doing something in the Middle East) could have most of the manpower. If we had more boots on ground in Afghanistan and Iraq right now instead of paying Navy and CG officers the same amount of money to sail around a ship out of harms way for 6 months at a time than maybe we wouldn't be in a conflict at all right now.|`|K2WwTNJyaa	i'd say that its fairly high, depending on what you consider the "near future" if the near future is this year, then no, i highly doubt it. if it is the next 10 years, then i can almsot guarantee it. the US has been entering a new war every few years since world war 2|`|RNkQ9qPQaa	Slim to None.

VjVWw0x5aa	All branches fight in wars, with answering the 2nd question you should talk to a recruiter, it has changed since I was in, and the third when I was in I had to get up early in the morning, march to the chow hall, drill which is marching and other movements, you will take classes on such things like the history of the Army, you will eat when they say eat, sleep when they say sleep, do a lot of exercising which is called PT.  Good Luck.|`|5qFmukWwaa	You "want to fight in war"...?  NOBODY in their right mind actually WANTS to fight in a war - least of all people in the military.  <br>  <br>  All the eager young recruits say they are willing to die for their country but very few of them think about the killing they might have to do.  Are you willing to be responsible for the deaths of children and babies?  Before anyone gets mad about this question, stop and think. I am NOT calling our military baby killers (see my source) I am saying that in ANY war babies and children are going to be casualties - its just a cold hard fact.  <br>  <br>  Ready to die for your country?  We all were.  Are you ready to come back as a quadriplegic?...as an amputee?...with permanent brain damage?<br>  <br>  As a woman you will not be assigned to a combat unit, but you will still be in harms way.  Women in Iraq are being wounded and killed whether they are in a combat unit or not.<br>  <br>  If you want to go into the military, then by all means go, but go in with your eyes wide open and not all fired up by too much TV and too many movies.|`|htaxf1jJaa	You can get deployed in any and all branches of the military. Reserves are actually less likely to deploy, but still have a high chance. <br>  <br>  You need to meet the requirements of basic training or boot camp of whatever branch you want to join. <br>  <br>  Boot camp is tough and challenging both mentally and physically. My brother graduated Parris Island for Marine boot camp in August 2008 and he said it was the toughest but most rewarding 13 weeks of his life. He really enjoyed it and he doesn't regret joining the Marines. My boyfriend is at Air Force basic right now in Lackland and the first letter he wrote to me said that basic wasn't what he expected, but he's strong. But as time went on, he started writing about how it was getting easier by the day and stuff, but his flight is doing really well and is really ahead of their brother flight, so their TI's are probably more "chill". Basic training / boot camp is not easy to go through, and prepare yourself physically, but don't forget to prepare yourself mentally too. Remember they're just playing a mind game with you and everytime they make fun of you, it's not really "real". Good luck.|`|q0gnYRPKaa	- All branches fight in war.  HENCE THE MILITARY!  Even the Coast Guard has had 1 death in the War on Terror.<br>  <br>  - The Army is pretty easy to get into.  Just be fit for basic/don't screw up too terribly bad.<br>  <br>  - Boot camp is rough, tough, but fun.  It sucks while your there but you will have plenty of stories to share when you get out.|`|jinAwMGNaa	If I were you, I would talk to the Military Recruiters in your area for specific information on all the requirements.  Also I would go into either the Air Force or the Navy as they have better living conditions and combat environments than the Army or the Marines.  If you want combat, check out the C-130 Specter Gunship.  It ROCKS, and they have Female Gunners!  Also they have the unmanned drones that you could fly if qualified.  Talk to the Air Force Recruiter first and then the Navy.  Personally, I'd stay away from the Army and Marines as jobs in those services are mostly non-combat for Women.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	As a female, if you want to fight or be engaged, then your best bet is to be an MP or Truck driver in any of the componenets of the Army or Marines (Active, Guard, Reserves).  Talk to some recruiters and find out what you qualify for and to figure out if active duty or reserve components are better for you.  Good luck.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	If you are a woman you will not be able to go into a "combat arms" MOS, which means you won't be able to fight in the wars.<br>  <br>  Every job is different and depends on your ASVAB scores and your physical fitness level.|`|9ujZijBPaa	Women are in combat, too. There are no front lines in this war. You can go active, reserve or national guard --- the guard deploys all of the time, too. If you get a job like 88M (truck driver), or as a combat medic (which there are a lot of female combat medics), your chances are really good for going. Women can't have some jobs, but that doesn't mean you won't see any action.<br>  <br>  You need to meet the basic ASVAB and physical standards for the Army. The recruiter can tell you whatever you need to know about that.|`|wrLu93C9aa	As an Army Combat Medic  -68W, chances are high that you will be near the front lines of Afghanistan or Iraq!

If you lived with them for six or more months of the year, and didn't pay any rent to them, then I think it would be fair to let them claim you.  If you make 80 grand a year, you could get by without a refund this year.  I don't know why they are worried about it if they make as much as you say they do?  Maybe they would have to pay less in taxes if they claim you?|`|t3QAaSN9aa	I don't believe your story.  In that income bracket there are easier ways to avoid taxes than an outright lie about a dependent that is easily checked by the IRS through social security numbers.|`|DgfEkFGLaa	So sorry your parents are that way. I do not believe in cheating on my taxes and didn't attempt to claim my daughter as a dependent once she graduated High School and began working full time. I supplied all of her basic needs so she could save up her money to buy a brand new car. Did your parents also supply all of your needs while you saved money to buy a house? Did you  contribute anything to the household income for living there or the food you ate? If not then perhaps they are not cheating, you are. If you were paying room and board that would be different but I suspect you just lived there sponging off of them.|`|MKrNZMVDaa	Mmmmh ...

The demand of consumers determines what is marketable and what isn't. The government doesn't, nor do any elected officials.

We have almost all had bad times but we didn't cry for the government to come and help us we worked it out and lived with it !

President Obama is trying to increase our family values. Because after this stimulus plan kicks in, all we will be able to spend is time with our families.|`|AA10672842	I don't understand how big corporations can  come to the government with hat in hand and basically beg to the gov't for access to public funds for loans.If these companies mismanaged their own money and stockholders money to the point of near bankruptcy  how can we suddenly believe that these corporations will be able to pass Business and Finance 101?They weren't responsible with their own money why should we believe they will suddenly have some epiphany now? I understand that these loans are to meant to avert a worse  economy because of the ripple affect a bankruptcy would cause to other businesses.I think part of the problem with companies such as the auto sector has been the exorbitant buy out packages employees have been given to reduce their workforce.Large lump sums of money, cars, etc.Seems like those employees would have the resources to ride out temporary  unemployment and the financial ability to pay for their own retraining in a new field. When Joe or Jilll Average works at  a small independent company the only severance package they get is several weeks notice in lieu of pay and a reference letter.Some people who lose their jobs are lucky to get their last paycheck never mind getting any sort of notice or separation pay.Those employees must rely on unemployment insurance and you only get that if you've waited for a period of time and have spent every last penny you have.These workers also stand to lose their homes and everything else they've worked for and the government isn't offering them any special loans to help them stay afloat.Those workers also paid taxes for many years, who speaks up for those workers who also need help in these difficult times.The auto sector has been given research  money  and tax incentives from the government to help them keep viable.It seems the companies did not think long range in staying solvent.I just want to know where Joe  and Jill Average signs up for government loans?|`|Ne3XNDRJaa	The whole point of Capitalism was to let rich people get richer, we accept capitalists into what we now call a "free market economy" where the big capitalists are forbidden from anti-trust, insider trading and monopoly, if this were a straight up capitalist society there would only be royalty and serfs...<br>  <br>  <br>  Semper, ROnald Reagan seemed to know what to do. When this tinkering that Obama is experimenting with was tried  it failed, the best thing is to let the market decide who fails and who succeeds, <br>  <br>  The problem now lies with the bottlencking of the credit markets,  banks have money to loan (TARP)  but they are afraid of lending it because they just made a series of bad decisions which got them where they are.  People who own homes they could barely afford, bought them without really qualifiying for those loans, now, people like me who lives in a house that is well within the means of my and my wifes incomes will have lower home values,  and we will be taxed heavily after 25 years of saving and studying and getting better at our professions, we are going to be taxed out of our home so that others can live in theirs.<br>  <br>  Socialism only works in a diminished role in a free market with capitalists kept in check.<br>  <br>  Its a tightrope Obama is woefully unprepared to walk.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Your point is correct except one cannot change the rules and then cry "foul"!  The banking industry collapsed because of Federal Government interference.  Does anyone really believe that any bank or other lending institution would grant low interest mortgages to anyone who was not qualified?  What would be the sense in that?  If you could make a profit loaning money to people who were not able to pay it back,  I would be a wealthy man.  <br>  <br>  The answer is obviously, that they were forced to make those loans by the Government.  Now that the whole scheme blew up, we cannot go blaming the banks.  They needed to be bailed out because if they were not...well, I will let you hear for yourself.  The first video below, is of a Democrat Congressman on C-span explaining about the banking collapse.  The interesting part starts about 1/3 of the way into it. The second video, is the Senate hearings while the Republicans still were in control of the Senate.  It was an investigation into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac due to concerns from Wall Street.  The people testifying are all Liberal Democrats who proceed to bash the regulators and laud how sound the two institutions are.  It was back at the end of 2004.  Four years later, they collapsed.  <br>  <br>  Franklin D. Raines is the CEO of Fannie Mae who drew 90 million dollars in salary and bonuses in 6 years.<br>  <br>  *

AA10504968	The sole reason for a business to exist is to make a profit.  The ethics of business is to deal with customers and investors in an honest way.

It could have been me. Still I wish I wasn't in that position. Not everyone who signs up expects to kill someone but it is something I thought I prepared for.  <br>  <br>  I still have nightmares from it - I sometimes wonder about their families and who would be missing them. I went throgh some counselling and trying to get on with my life.<br>  <br>  I've now left the army and work as a state trooper.

Army regulation states the separation policy for pregnant soldiers is strictly voluntary (unless discovered while in basic training then the separation is involuntary). Once pregnant, Soldiers may choose to remain in the Army or separate. Officers may choose to remain in the Service or request release from active duty, unless they are under obligation to the Army due to education or incentive pay. Soldiers may request ordinary, advance, or excess leave in order to return home or to another appropriate place for the birth, or to receive other maternity care. Leave is at the discretion of the command. T he Army allows a female Soldier to take 6-8 weeks of post partum maternity leave. In addition, the Soldier is not available for deployment for four months following the delivery date for parenthood. The post-partum soldier would also be exempt from taking the Physical Fitness Test for 180 days following the termination of pregnancy.
rHwE5Rkbaa	This happened repeatedly when I was up on the DMZ rotation in the summer of 1987.  Several nights, the North would come on the loudspeakers and say stuff like, "Hello Staff Sergeant John Smith! How are you doing tonight as patrol leader of the ambush patrol just west of Guard Post Oullette?? I hope things are going well for you."  Then the voice would run down all the rest of the members of the patrol.<br>  <br>  It was a constant battle there - and a constant pain to root out who was sending the info to the North, because the patrol members and locations weren't decided upon until about 1700 the day of the patrol, so between 5:00 p.m. and 1:00 a.m. SOMEONE was leaking the info.<br>  <br>  I heard this myself on at least a half a dozen occasions.

They don't spend MOST of what they earn (no stimulus).   <br>  <br>  What this is called is FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY - paying for what you spend.   We need to account for our spending increase, as close as we can, something Republicans have NEVER DONE, which is why they tend to set record deficits (going back to Reagan and 'Starve the Beast' policies).|`|x12mMdApaa	a person will get whip lash watching this guy.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	I don't think you have been paying adequate attention.  Obama said all along that he was going to raise taxes on those making over 250K but that the timing might not be right.  Obama is concerned that over time the deficit will make it harder for the economy to grow and create jobs.  His flexibility in addressing the current situation is one thing I admire about him.  Being stuck in inflexible ideology is a certain road to disaster. <br>  <br>  Wealthy people are not the job providers because our economy is consumer driven.  The wealthy can't invest in and make money on businesses that are not selling goods and services.  Businesses are not selling goods and services because people don't have the money to buy.  We need to create jobs, save jobs and put money into the hands of most people.|`|Ne3XNDRJaa	He will ony raise taxes on those evil rich people who earn over 125k a year. <br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and he will let Bush's tax cuts to everybody expire in 2010...effectively rasing taxes on everybody..<br>  <br>  <br>  BTW the 250k number lied about during the campaign was only for COUPLES earning that much , it was revised down as Obama took office to 200k and so now anone earning 100 to 125k is a target of Obama;s "Redistributive justice"|`|WCkOUF9aaa	He is an idiot if he raises taxes on business owners now.

What she said about the spending, I mean "stimulus" package was probably true, just not flattering, I didn't see her on The View but I can imagine she wasn't warmly welcomed, I also like Rush Limbaugh since he tells the truth that you liberals don't like to hear and don't want the world to know, and she must be somewhat popular or she wouldn't be able to get her books published at all, let alone have a syndicated column in the newspaper, or even be asked to be on "Larry King Live" while Joy was hosting it. <br>  <br>  I'm sure she knows all the lies and nonsense that you libbies spew about her, because she also tells a great deal of the truth that you people would prefer the world not know, but that doesn't make her transgendered and/or delusional simply because you libbies claim she is. That's pretty arrogant to think that because you libbies say it that it must be true. Not that it's new, though. <br>  <br>  Why is it so hard to believe that she once dated a Democrat, though I myself couldn't imagine why she'd want to do such a thing.

I think that calling her delusional is an insult to delusional people.  I have a problem with the whole "she's a man" thing.  It seems like the same kind of cheap, stupid argument that she would use.  Interesting thing.

Everyone sees right through the statements of the Republican Governors stating that they would refuse "parts" of the stimulus money for their states.  No governor that is doing what is best for their state would refuse ANY money at this moment - at least do so and expect to be re-elected.  But I find the humor in those that are stating they will refuse part of the money are those that are striving for the 2012 GOP nod.  <br>  <br>  The purest form of selfishness and narcissism.

xoK87yuGaa	To all Americans Yes, <br>  <br>  To the ignorant far right, he will never be an American, nor will he ever do anything good for this country.|`|8ad6fQiNaa	Well I've never seen his BC and there is a poorly done video on you-tube that shows his grandmother answering a question about barak obama being born in Kenya, that cuts out before you find out she was refering to the SR Obama. There were also all those lawsuits that against Obama that went to the SC, and then were thrown out. So there's some serious doubt as to whether he's a citizen or not.<br>  <br>    Lets use logic to solve this problem. We know for a fact that he ran for POTUS, and won. That's a high profile postion, with lots of opposition. First he had to compete against other democrats in the primaries. Each of every one of them would have researched Obama's history to find any dirt they could in order to beat him. None of them apparently found anything that would make them believe he isn't a citizen. The Dem party overall would have vetted him, to make sure that he had the best chance to win the election. Apparently he passed their inspection as well. <br>  <br>      Then Obama faced off against Mccain. Towards the end of the election 100% of his ads were negative. If Obama wasn't a citizen his campaign would have discovered this and all the ads would have been about the Dem party having an ineligible candidate. That never happened. In fact Mccain applauded Obama for being a great AMERICAN as well, he said they only had differing ideas about how to run the country.<br>  <br>      That's 2 major groups who had a lot to gain or lose if Obama wasn't a citizen. They both have the means to research and get a definate answer about his birth, and neither of them saw anything worthwhile to bring up. Then we have the media. We can claim that the media is "liberal biased", but Fox news would have ran with that story if it were true. <br>  <br>       So that's 3 major groups. The biggest one of all to think about is the  Government. Not only the federal gov, but each state as well. Obama had to provide documentation to the government to get on the ballot. Each state had access to those documents in order to verify his eligibility. Nader wasn't on every ballot, because some states felt that he didn't meet the requirements. Why would those same states allow 1 candidate who was ineligible and stop another? <br>  <br>       So the 4 major groups who had the ability to verify Obama's citizenship and to expose him if he was ineligible all found no reason to stop his candidacy. So logically Obama is either a citizen or all those groups are in collusion with him.<br>  <br>     I'll go with the idea that Obama is a citizen.|`|PwR7SWbCaa	Obama was born in Kenya, just like his Kenyan grandmother says..go to youtube and watch her admit it herself!|`|hexzaIGgaa	You know what I hope.

His medical and university records have not been given up form examination unlike McCain who gave his up. <br>  <br>  NO Federal agency or branch of government has declared Obama to be a natural born citizen but the Senate passed a resolution last year declaring McCain to be a natural born citizen because both his parents were U.S.cotizens while he was born in the Panama Canal zone.   <br>  <br>  This issue has to still be resolved and there are court cases still filed on this. you can write to the Third Circuit court of Appeals asking them to hear the cases on Obama's citizenship issue at:<br>  <br>  Third Court of Appeals <br>  P.O.

VVCpJFxtaa	Being that you are female, there are no primarily combat positions open to females in any branch with the exception of pilot so you have little to worry about there. Sorry but, I fail to see how being in the band is helping your country. You should try either the navy of the air force. They may have what you are looking for with regards to environmental science jobs.<br>  Just my opinion but, nothing you stated sounds like you are really interested in joining the military. It sounds more like you are trying to uphold a family tradition. There are plenty of other ways to get what you are seeking without joining the military. Being a soldier, sailor, airmen, or marine is serious and takes a serious dedication on the part of that individual. You must know that when you join, your life literally belongs to the military. They will tell you what to do, where to go, and if necessary who to kill. It is like no other job in the world. Make sure you are truly ready to make this commitment before you join. Good luck with whatever decision you make.|`|PBq7ODPzaa	Keep in mind that unless you intent to go to one of the Military Academies the military education system is mostly based on training someone in a trade and isn't a college type education.<br>  <br>    Also, all of the services have musicians.  These are not "Band programs" in the sense that you have in schools.  The people in the bands are full time musicians.  That's their job.<br>  <br>    Have you thought about joining ROTC?  That way the military will pay for your college and you can serve as an officer after you graduate.  The navy or coast guard would be best if your want to pursue a career in Biological Sciences.|`|b21fc34917b458cf7b37456bede7feb9aa	I personally believe you should not go into the military for those reasons.

Education and civilian resume building programs are provided for but that is SECONDARY.  if the primary purpose of the military was to educate you, it wouldn't be called "military"... it would be called college.  Go to college.|`|lizxjPKFaa	I understand that I will be trained in combat, but I don't want it to be my primary duty.<br>  <br>  Are you kidding? This is a time of war, you tool. <br>  Do not join MY military to get a free pass --- and yes, that IS what you are trying to do.|`|K8qAniReaa	Whether or not the military is a good choice for you is entirely up to you.  You are the only person that can answer that question.<br>  <br>  Which branch you choose depends on what kind of career you want, what type of missions  you want, and what kind of lifestyle you want.  They are all very unique.<br>  <br>  If you want to join the military and get your BA you can join as an officer.  With a degree in hard science like the one you are pursuing your career options are endless with the military.  You can join any branch and you are eligible for just about any specialty.  <br>  <br>  Which branch you choose depends on what you want the most out of your career.  The only thing is you can't join the Coast Guard as an officer because they only take officers that served as officers in other branches.  You could try applying for the Coast Guard academy if your grades are good enough.  If you are accepted that would entail a five year obligation to the Coast Guard.  Every branch has a service academy.  But the Coast Guard is the only branch that gets their officers almost exclusively from that source.<br>  <br>  If you decide you want to join one of the other branches you can get a scholarship in ROTC.  That will cover the cost of tuition and books and they would give you a monthly stipend that increases every year.  <br>  <br>  You also have the choice of going to college and getting your BA and MA on your own then applying for Officer Candidate School after graduation.  If you do this the military will not repay your student loans but you will get the opportunity to be an officer.<br>  <br>  Whichever choice you make I must warn you *do not* go to an enlisted recruiter to discuss officer options.  Enlisted recruiters just want to make their quota and getting someone with a college degree to enlist will certainly make them look good.  Just go to your preferred branches website and fill out the form saying you are interested in becoming an *officer* and an officer recruiter will contact you.|`|vQD5IX9daa	Each military branch has college funds available, but from what I understand the Coast Guard is one of the toughest to actually qualify for.<br>  My suggestion would definitely be to talk to recruiters from EACH BRANCH before you make a decision. They are great salesmen (they get about $2000 for each recruit they sign up), so don't agree to ANYTHING upfront. Take the ASVAB  and see what MOS's you actually QUALIFY for, and then make a decision. <br>  You will find out at that time what, if any, enlistment bonus you also qualify for. Some are now as high as $60,000!  <br>  When you do make your decsion, make sure you get WHATEVER  they promise you IN WRITING.<br>  (I'm not insinuating that recruiters are dishonest, but everyone makes mistakes, and it's your future that's important here. This is a life/changing decision and you don't want there to be any snags) <br>  <br>  And all branches of the service have rules AGAINST  women in combat, so that shouldn't be a big concern. <br>  (not to say you'll NEVER see it, if you're assigned somewhere where combat is happening it could come to YOU, there is no guaruntee you'll NEVER see it). <br>   <br>   Like I said above, this is a very big decision, so don't take it lightly. Do alot of research and make an informed decision.<br>  Hope this helps:)<br>  Todd

Don't you wish, Obama has only solidified the Republican Party, listen to Queen Nancy whine about it.  BTW, Rush Limbaugh said he hopes Obama's "liberal policies" fail.  He wished Obama the best.  You would learn if you listened to his "education in broadcasting"|`|kJM65nXJaa	The republicans are so confused right now, they don't know whether to wind their *** or wipe their watch. They are so used to lock step, towing the party line, they have no way to cope with dissension. Yea, it is fairly amusing.|`|noo8vpvzaa	So when 2 Democrats (who aren't even politicians) have a disagreement, there is 'infighting in the Democratic party'?<br>  <br>  Give me a break<br>  <br>  Hey, btw...Did you happen to catch the Dem primaries?|`|HHv2qGGcaa	I just wish they'd get their act together...this GOP is unrecognizable from the party of Lincoln...|`|yKycwvf8aa	Just goes to show how much of an idiot Rush is.

fKFvzlzQaa	I recommend that your friend hire an attorney who specializes in the defense of DUI.<br>  <br>  If your friend only had two beers he should not have been considered to be operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol.<br>  <br>  I would say that your friend probably has a good defense but he needs a competent and ecperienced attorney to make the defense for him.<br>  <br>  A DUI conviction could be devastating to him. He definitely needs to hire an attorney.|`|rHwE5Rkbaa	Okay, you say that the driver was "sober like crazy" but he admitted to drinking at least two beers.  How long before driving did he have them - or at least the last one?  If both were consumed within one hour of each other, then it would take two hours or more for him to come up with a BAC of 0.0... if more than an hour between beers, then at least an hour to process each beer to get a BAC of 0.0.  <br>  <br>  You don't specifically know how he did on the field sobriety test - he may have been borderline on several of the tests.  Also, even in Portuguese, M doesn't follow E - so he just screwed it up.  You also don't know how he was doing on the horizontal gaze nystagmus - so his eyes could have been bopping all over without you knowing - and the cops picked up on it.<br>  <br>  Secondly, when the kid was arrested, you offered to drive, because you were "pretty much sober."  Sorry - pretty much sober is the same as pretty much drunk, and you were in no condition to drive.<br>  <br>  Was he given a breathalyzer at the police station?  If not, then there is nothing to prove he was over the limit.  Is there any possibility that he was too drunk to remember getting it at the cop shop?<br>  <br>  I recommend getting a lawyer to represent him.  Also, the driver's license can be forfeit, depending on the jurisdiction.|`|9hhxojfZaa	I don't know if your friend has the money for an attorney, but I would definitely fight this.  I don't think the miranda rights thing is considered a valid reason to dismiss a case.  I think that's only on TV.  I mean the officer will just say he did anyway.  I think an officer can make the determination if someone is drunk or not, he doesn't have to administer any breath or blood test, but if he does want to, the driver can't refuse.  When arrested for a DUI, you automatically lose your license!  Tell your friend not to go to a DMV hearing without an attorney, otherwise he is screwed!  If I was your friend, I would say that he told the officer he was sober and demanded a breathalyzer to prove it, but the officer wouldn't give him one.  The car thing too, is BS I would fight to not have to pay, or get refunded any impound fes too.  The officer should have let someone drive it, or at least determine if someone was sober enough to drive it.<br>  <br>  Sounds to me like this cop dropped the ball on this one.  If all he has to go on is a ABC test from a person that does not speak english well, than it is a weak case.  I bet, if your friend gets an attorney, that the DA will drop the case.  Oh, also see if police in your town have dash cams on their cars.

They want to know if you're going to go nuts and blab everything to the Soviets.  Just ask your recruiter what he thinks, but I think you should probably just stay quiet about it.  I wouldn't even call circumcision "surgery".  A lot of kids are circumcised and you don't put it on your MEPS physical.  What difference does it make if the kid is a day old or nine years?|`|XA69SIvnaa	Don't do anything, even if the military actually did investigate every recruit's medical history (they dont) you wouldn't be kicked for that.|`|3caq6SFxaa	That is not a problem-if you want tell the doctor when you go back to MEPS but will not actually effect anything.|`|47ddda29b6896ce72acab50c6bef43fdaa	You won't be kicked out.

5f52c5c3d1d0deab80192fb888e39e9aaa	I'm for legalization of pot, but none of the other illegal, recreational drugs. I don't see any more damage being done by pot than by alcohol. Other drugs are physiologically addictive (crack, heroine, etc.), and most hallucinogens can cause some pretty serious damage. None of these things is true of pot. Even my neuroscience professor at one of the largest universities in the country agrees with me on this, and supports the fact that there are some heath benefits to using pot once and awhile.|`|T2JlDJD7aa	Give up the pot for good.

I can't wait to see what is going to happen, and how his ideas work.  <br>  <br>  I am sorry that not everyone likes him.  And I also know that some things are not going to work.  But at the moment, I see him doing a good job, and listening to those advising him and trying to work with others that may not feel the same way.  But there will be those that no matter what he does, they will not like the idea and/or fight him.  That is their cross to bear.  But I don't really see how the GOP has any hope when people are playing politics rather than actually look at the millions out of jobs and trying to do things to help them out.

Look at this chart:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ourfuture.org/files/economic-benefits-of-stimul.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ourfuture.org/files/economic-...</a><br>  <br>  This shows the return on investment from various govt. spending.  This chart is not just liberal claptrap, it was done by one of John McCain's top economic advisers.  Everything above the middle pays back more than we invest in it.  Everything below the middle is a net loss. What it shows is that tax cuts are not a good investment.  Infrastructure, extending unemployment benefits, etc. are good investments.  All the Republicans want to do is cut taxes, even though that was what got us into this mess in the first place.<br>  <br>  Secondly, every Republican since Reagan has promised to cut spending, reduce deficits, reduce the size of government, etc.  But they all left the debt much bigger than it was before.  The ONLY president since Reagan who actually DID reduce deficits, make government smaller, cut spending, and give the middle class a tax cut was Clinton, a Democrat.  The Democrats have become the party of fiscal responsibility.<br>  <br>  So if that's what you really want, to reduce deficits, a Democrat can do it easier than a Republican.  If you just want your little tax cut and don't care what happens after that, well that's what Republicans do.|`|SGwkPy62aa	It is just more of his 'make you feel good' speech.  He has learned to say what he thinks folks want to hear, regardless of logic or reality, and there are those in America (drooling Obama groupies) that believe anything he says as gospel.  It is illogical to increase spending, massively increase the national debt, state you are going to cutting taxes for 95% of Americans, increase welfare and entitlement benefits, while unemployment is increasing, then say you are going to cut the deficit in half.  Even my 10 year old daughter understands it is an illogical claim.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	By printing an extra 10 billion 100 dollar bills<br>  <br>  He can't do any of the things he says he will do and has no intention to do them.  He only has to mark time for a while until he is ready for the next step.|`|spuz7DvNaa	Lie lie lie. He is planing on spending even more. This jackazz will say anything because he knows that his liberal supporters live in a dream world or are too stoned to care.|`|w8owmaDGaa	Easy.<br>  He'll just make a speech saying that he just cut the deficit in half.<br>  <br>  The media will all say what a wonderful, superior job he did in cutting the deficit in half.<br>  <br>  The Obamabots will all chat "Change!" "Change!" "Change!" <br>  <br>  Someone will point out that the deficit has doubled and promptly be hooted down.<br>  <br>  The Puppet and company will move on to the next project.<br>  .<br>  .|`|2KNzw0Rbaa	Well he is tripling it in his first year, so by 'cutting it in half' he is really only going to increase it by 50% by the end of his term. Of course, not including any other 'stimulus' packages.|`|hXwqKidraa	It's simple math. Your allowance is $20. I give you $400 more for two years. Then I take off $210. See? I can now claim I reduced your allowance by half. (%50) <br>  <br>  Almost like magic, eh?<br>  <br>  What's a few Trillion among comrades?|`|EAqQXm7Oaa	Well, considering all republicans since Eisenhower have increased the deficit and all democrats except carter shrank it, I don't find it hard to believe.|`|M77i6Kdnaa	just keep taxing the rich<br>  98% taxes for the rich seems like a good idea to me<br>  <br>  oh and print more money. just keep printing it nonstop put the speed on high that will surely solve everything|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	National defense will be the first to go.|`|hChhOhOGaa	Because by the year 2012 it will be too late to impeach him so he can say whatever he wants...whether it is true or not.|`|KtJmEx1zaa	He is being consistent. He broke every other promise, why would this one be anything but a load of bull too?
t3QAaSN9aa	Yes, as long as he ran on the Democratic ticket and was opposed by McCain/Palin.  He may even have gotten more votes.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	I still would have voted for him|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	That is hard to say for sure but I think probably not. The increase in the black vote alone would have put him ahead I believe. But, I would have to look back on the election records to be sure. Obama won...more or less ...fair and square...so he is my President. I disagree with his policies but will want to see the results before I pass judgement on him.|`|um87XJvmaa	Given the choice of Obama/Biden or McCain/PALIN, I would still have voted for the democrat ticket.|`|teeQmWsBaa	Not even considered.|`|pgdTmT6caa	We will never know.|`|caEUniHKaa	Absolutely NOT  ! he was elected because he is black..black people voted for him because he is black. and no other reason.....and white people because they don't want to be considered racist.<br>   He has no experience..he may be intelligent but there are alot of intelligent people in the world..and he is a good speaker..but that is about it..he came through Chigagos dirty political  machine/shenanigans and he and otheres paid for him to play..period.|`|sHWh47jFaa	nope, probably not. He wouldn't have gotten nearly as much media coverage, which was the only reason he got any following to begin with.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	Interesting question.Not to take anything away for him but I think he had a huge advantage with the majority of the black voters being predisposed to vote for him because of his race.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Seriously, who gives a ****!  The election was in November and he's been president for a month.  Let it go already.|`|nx7QtF0paa	To answer your question, No- Because the white guy running against him had more credentials and more experience and lost.|`|wdBY1fWaaa	I think he would. The minority population helped him win, but it wasn't the biggest factor.|`|7031265d0531963ae96124dd73a8cd85aa	I doubt it. <br>  He doesn't have a track record! He hasn't done **** and look at the giant clusterfuc* going on in Illinois... WHERE HE'S FROM!|`|HfPT0nSsaa	No. If people looked at what he stands for more before the election he never would have made it.|`|b34cA7bVaa	probably because if the right "organizations" want someone voted in they will get them voted in. Anymore our vote seems to count for nothing but a warm fuzzy feeling inside
JrrDtwVZaa	Basic is 8.5 weeks, and depending on the job the tech school could be a month up to 23 months.<br>  <br>  Here are the listings for tech school|`|htaxf1jJaa	Well my boyfriend is at Lackland AFB right now for basic training and he left for meps on January 5th and got to Lackland on January 6th, and he graduates March 6th. It's 8.5 weeks long. Tech school depends on what his job is going to be. Security Forces is 65 days, im not really sure about the others. I hope I helped. Email me if you wanna talk =)|`|Cx8EKcemaa	Basic is 8 weeks for the AF I think. And tech school is different for every school. Anywhere from 2 weeks to 2 years. Google his job and you may find out how long the school is.
yb4FbFiSaa	If the last General Election had been based on number of votes, instead of parliamentary seats, they wouldn't be in power now.  It doesn't look too good for Labour.  If they can think up a new 'Big Lie' they may be back sooner than that.  The recession isn't going to last forever, and when things improve they will want to take the credit somehow.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	What Labour needs is a spell out of government.  3 terms is too many for any colour of politician.  <br>  <br>  The next Parliament will probably be hung and end up with a Lib/Lab pact.  I'd actually prefer a short Tory government.|`|VfYvJypEaa	Hopefully never again .|`|AA11500002	Won't bother me - I will be pushing up daisies or going up in smoke before this bunch of idiots get another chance.|`|YHPYg7pWaa	I would agree with the questioner's estimate of 20years.<br>  This Labour Government is like a rudderless ship  drifting from one catastrophe to another led by a political 'has been' Labour Prime Minister who in turn is being led 'by the nose' by Peter Mandelson;The sinister 'black shadow' of British politics.|`|NnY1wG11aa	The Labour party in its present form, never, the chances of The Labour Party surviving 10 years in its present form slim to zero.<br>  <br>  The Labour Party as it is, is doomed, and you know what I think they know-it, its just that there isn't one with a stiff enough backbone to anything about it.|`|4BeKVZsPaa	i think your estimate of twenty years is pretty good.<br>  two conservative terms whilst the public are still p1ssed off with labour, then a term of the lib dems whilst labour are trying to find a worthy leader<br>  then one more of the conservatives because everyone will realise that the lib dems are U/S and then step forward the new tony blair all smiles and ******** and the voters will think he is the messiah.<br>  welcome back labour after twenty years in the wilderness.<br>  its enough to make you puke hey?|`|jqLWuLkDaa	A very long time I hope.  It is quite possible that the Lib/Dems will overtake this shower on nu labour ess aitch one tee and be the second largest party after the next general election.|`|fyhl3TQgaa	If they do anything worse, it'll be 30 years, but, certainly, it'll take a generation.|`|4eLzY2hfaa	you can bet your mamma's burka that you'll have sharia law before that happens!|`|wE8NppnLaa	YEAH, similar to the Tories' time in the wilderness; at least 12 to 15 years if Labour are lucky.|`|wt5HFemMaa	Hopefully never - and I will rejoice.|`|67FNEU6Haa	Won't be a Labour government for a very long time...<br>  they had to rebrand themselves as "New" Labour to get in in 1997, now anything tagged with the name "labour" will despised so they'll have to come up with a new name|`|AA11422300	NEVER, I hope.Gordon Brown ought to go down in history as the worst UK PM ever .|`|713e0a0443aa5228739b2185d0ed90a8aa	the way their going never.|`|JhC6BvPpaa	Knowing the lilly livered so in so's that vote in this country, they'll be meowing to Labour to make a comeback within 4-5 years of the Tory tax increases, just like they always do.<br>  <br>  VOTE UKIP|`|AA12121752	Never
YFzprqqgaa	I wrote my congressman recently and asked him to not vote in favor of the stimulus bill.  I explained to him that our grandchildren would have to pay for it with crushingly high taxes.  He replied, saying that he was going to vote in favor of it, regardless that the majority of his constituency is against the stimulus bill.  Notice my name.  I advised him that I was going to actively campaign against him when he came up for re-election, and I will.|`|IG8s8UnSaa	I would make time for two topics.  Illegal immigration and the insane spending bill.  I would commend him for fighting both on our behalf.
