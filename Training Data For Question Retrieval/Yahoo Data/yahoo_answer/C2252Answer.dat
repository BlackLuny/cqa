PZqP1TBUaa	you can make custom armor to get you stats that high but thats the only way i know cos i dont go on private servers anymore <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdzxAN55B7Y&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdzxAN55B...</a><br>  <br>  thats the video which showed me how to add custom armor if you dont know how to do that already|`|5NpI6rLwaa	Well, you cant get your stats that high! unless your playing on a private server.....oh wait, did u say "your" server? as in your own private server? cuz then i guess you could get stats like that, but i'm not sure how. but in the Real WoW, you cant get those stats|`|6cwJi5kxaa	how are your stats at 99999?? i play wow and for some reason im not understanding your question :(
WSFJToYMaa	The various people that sometimes show up are part of the new, updated interface that was included in the previous update of the site.The don't really mean anything, it's just something to add realism to the idea that it's supposed to be a real medieval city.<br>  <br>  As for the statue, you have to be playing on a world that allows a paladin to be built; not all worlds included this feature. I'm pretty sure that if you're playing on a world that allows paladins, there will already be a statue in the first city you get when you start in the world.
iWKn0wSiaa	I play it at my boyfriends house and it really is addicting. I've been playing it for a good while now. Level 35 Warlock!!|`|rUbnCCDhaa	i think so|`|PY160XO7aa	NO Its stinks plus pay to play|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	Um... You could. But why?<br>  <br>  You can buy a 'trial' disc for next to nothing in most shops, depending on where you go, some places will give you the thing for a quarter.<br>  <br>  You're still going to have to pay for monthly service, so it's not like you beat the system here.<br>  <br>  But yes, the game is well worth it, it's a fantastic game absolutely BRIMMING with content.|`|C62F31Dwaa	Maaaaaaaaaaaaybe,lol. Depends how much you would use it a week....or month...or year...or century.|`|6cwJi5kxaa	17 hours to download??? yes it is definately worth it!! i have an epic 80 warlock and a 62 priest....|`|OnMrGKtEaa	I believe its worth it. The trial shows that it is a really good game... If you actually BUY the game though, it's definitely worth it (considering you have to pay monthly) but you can also get access to private servers (you can find them by looking online) and play for free. It is a really good game, I think its worth downloading. If you decide to download it, you might want to start it on a weekday when there is school and start it in the morning, letting it run all day and the night. Then, you can play it the next day! ;) Good luck!<br>  <br>  -Robert|`|PZqP1TBUaa	well if it takes 17 hours and its from one of the wow disks and you haven't played it on that computer before i would check if your computer meets the system requirements but iv been playing wow for 3 years now(73 hunter 68 dk^^) and if i had to install it again and it was going to take me 17 hours as well as having to go buy the original disks and tbc i would still wait all that time. just leave your computer on and go and watch tv or sommit^^|`|a2ba4be746681f93bc35fe00ef232558aa	Depends on how much you like MMORPGs. If you like them a lot, then yes, from personal experience with several MMORPGs I settled on WoW about a year and a half ago. I will admit at times it can get incredibly addictive and incredibly frustrating, but overall, it is an extremely fun game, just make sure to play in moderation so you don't get sucked in.|`|IdCJMrhKaa	just go buy it at an electronics store the digital download can take a while depending on your connection etc...|`|ZXkmsCT4aa	Nope. Because unless your using the CD its probably has a crap load of virsues and probably illegal.|`|eZj1qCd7aa	It's a good game it is pretty fun. HOWEVER make sure you don't play TOO much or else you will get SERIOUSLY addicted.|`|rm2kykQEaa	Depends if you wanna play it :P<br>  I personally dont want wow because of my laptop.|`|SjGpbohiaa	NO it isn't.|`|KBGbpjdmaa	yes it is worth waiting because you can download the free trial and save it to your hard drive and you want have to pay for the game|`|G5WCJonxaa	DONT DO IT!!!!! its not worth it but if you like the game go ahead. there are planty more fun games to play then world of warcraft

RjGtp41Zaa	Crap! I just packed away my Brood War strategy guide! Well, if I remember correctly, the new units are:<br>  <br>  Zerg Lurker: Ground Unit; evolves from Hydralisk; must be burrowed to attack; uses spines on back to make a devestating attack against Infantry units and Seige Tanks.<br>  <br>  Zerg Devourer: Air unit; evolves from Mutalisk; only attacks air units; has splash damage; slows enemies down, increases damage with future attacks<br>  <br>  Terran Medic: Heals infantry units; uses Solar Flair to "blind" long range attackers (Guardians, Overlords and Seige Tanks)<br>  <br>  Protoss Dark Archon: Ground Unit; no actual attacks; can paralyze Infantry units using Energy; can convert any unit to the protoss faction (use against Builder Units to create a new army)|`|E8MUtC52aa	www.gamefaqs.com<br>  <br>  theres too much information to post here.<br>  <br>  the game has been out forever, and with all the new maps that are out, theres tons of different strategies. <br>  <br>  at this point, hit points dont mean anything, but what units they do weell against and which they dont.

cZaLXgEEaa	Every single one of my games involves guns...besides Little Big Planet.<br>  <br>  Trust me, boy, girl, FPS shooter lover, action lover whatever. This game is for EVERYONE. It's amazing. The story mode is pretty cool but multiplayer is where everything goes epic. Literally millions of levels created by other users, you can create your own levels too. And it's soooo easy to create your own levels! You can make platforms, winches, pistons, rods, springs, strings, bolts, spring bolts, moving bolts, set things to timers, custominze your own vehicles (make rockets, cars, or whatever your imagination can think of), buildings, literally, you can literally create anything you want on Little Big Planet. When you made your level, simply publish it.<br>  <br>  Seriously, this gotta be in my Top 3 games. It's sooo worth buying. It doesn't matter if your only into gun games. Buy it.|`|BiMeb75Gaa	The Play section of LittleBigPlanet consists of a number of levels that have been created by Media Molecule, and are based around different themes that draw inspiration from real-world locations, such as Japanese gardens, dry deserts, New York City streets and icy Russian stages. By completing the levels available to them, the player may then advance the story and play further unlocked levels. The story mode comprises eight themed areas, with each area containing three or four main levels, and some of these levels in turn contain collectable keys to unlock bonus mini-levels;[thus, the main story mode comprises more than 50 pre-built levels in total. It's great and it is worth buying, it's great!|`|0wQF2Gw2aa	It's more than worth it. It's a lot of fun. It's not intense like FPS. For the most part, you can take your time and get to know the levels. The levels are pure genius. It's amazing how things look so different from a miniature point of view.<br>  <br>  I don't know why, but the game remind me of the TV show Pushing Daisies. The TV show is kind of quirky and the game is kind of quirky. There's also the narrator telling you what's going on and offering you hints, much like how the TV show has the narrator telling you what's going on.<br>  <br>  If you have an artistic side to you, you can create your own levels and upload it to PSN and share it with other people. You can also download other people's levels.|`|972OdSIJaa	depends if you want a game where you create levels and jump around.<br>  <br>  but in my view. no aint worth it. unless your a girl.|`|AA10836670	its more worth it if u have friends/family memebers that play with you often. it was made for multiplayer. <br>  <br>  the main thing is the cuztomization of your sackboy (main character)<br>  as you collect items, anything look is possible. <br>  <br>  other then jumping, u hang on to stuff, ride vehicals, and (this is for fun, doesnt help with completion of stages), slap each other around. move ur body however u want, and change facial expression, where ur sackboy looks, move ur hands so it looks like ur dancing.<br>  <br>  its fun but much better with all 4 players.<br>  <br>  hanging onto each other and dragging the other player is also fun. <br>  <br>  graphics are supurb and if u have HDTV, godly.<br>  <br>  thats just my take. u might not like multiplayer games that are kinda straight foward and easy. but i do.
2GNFQPdmaa	Everyone playing in an online game has to have the same version of the game. If you don't have it patched, you could only play against other people who don't have it patched. Finding a server specifically for an older version of a game is usually pretty difficult, so for practical purposes, you can't play online. Unless you have a bunch of friends who don't have it patched, then you could set up a server and play with them, I suppose.|`|0wQF2Gw2aa	yes , you have to donwload them , when you load the game it will tell you to update

72UTm6qAaa	Without making a schedule or getting hurt? I'm afraid you're somewhat screwed on that one. The schedule is probably your best bet, but I doubt it will go well.

tezNJNGKaa	They are married I think, so, get their relation ship up to 100 again, because it usually isn't.<br>  Get them both to relax on the bed and click 'Try for a baby'<br>  Sometimes it doesn't work. Just keep on trying and make sure they are in love and their relationship is high.<br>  If that STILL doesn't work, you could always use a cheat.<br>  Type in boolprop testingcheatsenabled true<br>  Press shift and click on Priya, then click 'Tomb stone of L and D' <br>  When the tombstone comes up, click 'Make a baby' or something along those likes, and it will come up with the names of the people in the household, so click Sanjay, and Priya will automatically become pregnant with Sanjay's baby!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|8q82dLS8aa	Just keep woohooing<br>  <br>  they have to woohoo first to get the baby option<br>  <br>  maybe they haven't ever whoohooed yet<br>  <br>  try that|`|G7SL3YuLaa	Firstly, check their relationship status with each other. If it is at least more than 90 on both scales then there should be a 'Try for Baby' button.<br>  Also, they may be too old. I found that if a Sim gets really close to being an Elder then they can't have a baby, so check the time line of the sim in the control panel where everything else is. If they are too old then get your Sim's aspiration metre to at least gold, and if you have enough points, you can buy this drink machine thing in the rewards panel and this will reduce their age if you make them drink it. If you do this, (if this is the case) then there should be a 'Try for Baby' button.<br>  Another thing, if they both fail is just keep clicking on 'WooHoo'. That sometimes works.<br>  I actually have this couple on my Sims 2 Seasons game and I managed to make them have a baby, but try these possibilities and see if they work. Hope I helped! :)|`|5wcgYT8uaa	have you tried before?<br>  if not either they are elderly or one is elderly and one is young.<br>  if she starts being sick in the loo then she will probs be prenant.
eae407c249076a56758cc99d008a9d3baa	In terms of gameplay and genre, there are countless games following Killzone's storyline and gameplay factor, from the bit era to our 3-D era. Halo, Contra, Gears, Battlefield, and many others are just like Killzone.<br>  <br>  However Killzone has the ability to boast for now superior graphics, gameplay system and Usability of that system. At this time Killzone cannot be compared in this field.<br>  <br>  Killzone, like other revolutionaries in the gaming world, is very common. One example is Final Fantasy 12 which introduced the "free world" system.|`|sSDJLUzOaa	none 360 is beat|`|AA10911952	I honestly don't think there is a game like Killzone 2 on the xbox 360.

AA10911952	If you own both games then you don't need to patch them to play single player campaigns, but you will need the update/ patch if you want to play multiplayer.<br>  <br>  If I remember correctly, when you choose the multiplayer option the game updates for you|`|RxHb1P4Faa	Are you talking about the update patch so that it will get rid of all of the errors in the game?

ZIc7aGJTaa	I would defiantly buy Pokemon for the DS.  You can even buy a used one for about $20 now and the game can give you 600+ hours if your like me and enjoy battling and trading with people online. It takes you at least 40+ hours to beat the game and then you have to work on collecting almost 500 creatures so for 20 or 30 dollars I think its a great buy|`|khDRIKaOaa	If i were you i would get Diamond.Because you catch Dialga in it.Plus there's more Action Replay Codes For Pokemon Diamond|`|6hpL9TAjaa	Well, it depends what you mean.  If you're asking if its worth it to buy a DS for pokemon diamond/pearl ONLY, then probably not.  If otherwise, sure.  I would go with diamond,  because its slightly better than pearl in the way that there are more good pokemon in diamond.  Plus, like others have stated, it has GREAT gameplay hours, with 40+ hours to complete the main game and 150+ hours to catch em' all.|`|k8h2kAd1aa	yes.Diamond
sWKGUPziaa	You can try this site. There are codes on here that might work for you, besides a whole lot of people asking for them.

AA11850311	First, my favorite site is <a href="http://modthesims2.com" rel="nofollow">http://modthesims2.com</a><br>  All content is free, and there are new items daily.  Everything there is scanned to be virus and hack free, unless of course it specifically states that it is a game hack or mod.  It is the only site I trust 100%<br>  When you set up your account, you can have the site show you only items that are compatible with your configuration of expansion packs.<br>  If you download and install the custom content correctly 99%+ of the items there will work.  The basics are as follows<br>  Only get items that are compatible with your games.  If the item requires Pets, but you don't have Pets, don't get it!  It can seriously mess up your game at worst, or at best, just not show up in-game.<br>  Custom Content must be placed in the correct folder  <br>  My Documents / EA Games / Sims2 / Downloads  <br>  or User / Documents / EA Games / Sims2 / Downloads on Vista  <br>  Putting CC in your Program Files or on your desktop will not work.<br>  Custom content must be extracted.  Putting .zip or .rar files in the Downloads folder will not work, you must un-compress those files.<br>  Most files when uncompressed will be .package files, but sometimes they will be Sims2Pack files.  Sims2Pack files will have a round blue icon with a person or house in the middle.  These are most often complete sims, or lots.  You must double click on the blue icon to get those files to install.<br>  Sometimes custom content requires a separate file called a mesh to be downloaded as well.  Creators should make a note of that, and provide a link.  (Custom content showing up as the same default clothing or hair style often means you did not get the required mesh)<br>  The guide below has more complete instructions on installing custom content.<br>  <a href="http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Downloading_for_Fracking_Idiots" rel="nofollow">http://www.sims2wiki.info/wiki.php?title...</a><br>  Additionally, be extremely careful about getting anything from the Exchange on the official Sims2.ea.com website. The objects there are fine, as they are made by Maxis, but I would not trust any of the sims, and certainly not the houses. Anyone can upload anything and they are not checked for hacks. You could easily download something that you don't know about or want, and it could really mess with your game.

YoyGzi2Aaa	Here's the bottom line, the Wii should not be compared to the other two. So between the 360 and PS3, I vote 360. <br>  Why? Better games, more games, greater online community, graphically equal, if one is better than the other graphically it's not by a very big margin. <br>  The Wii is on it's own level. The Wii is NOT a good PRIMARY system. It's great for all those Nintendo exclusive titles like your Marios and Zeldas and workout games and such. Obviously you can't just own a Wii and expect to one day get Resident Evil 5, Gears of War, or any of the bigger titles. <br>  I own both a Wii and 360 and I LOOOOVE them both for their own reasons.<br>  PS3, whatever. Blu-ray? Big deal. I don't want to pay over $400 for a game system simply because it plays blu-ray movies. I don't care for blu-ray right now. If I ever do, blu-ray players aren't that expensive anymore. I want my game console to be A GAME CONSOLE first and foremost.|`|9qiLZp50aa	XBox and PS are great for mature games. Good for graphics, and more challenging games. The Wii is more for children who are looking for a fun time.|`|1WgOj89kaa	PS3 BY FAR! The only reason the 360 is cheaper is because you are getting so much less than you get with the PS3. With free online play, blu-ray support, internet browser, the best titles, including Killzone 2, Uncharted, Resistance, Little Big Planet. etc etc etc. Overall, the PS3 is by far the best.|`|fZqvuKHuaa	I love my wii because I like the controls of it and the choice of simple games available. I just can't complete anything too difficult!<br>  <br>  A lot of people like xbox for the online community, if you have friends with xbox live you'll probably have hours and hours of fun. It adds more excitement to the game.<br>  <br>  Playstation 3 seems like the ultimate man toy though. Most of the games are completely 'macho' like war games, fighting games, driving games etc.<br>  <br>  Have a look at the choice of games available on each console before you buy one; different consoles specialise in different game types or have the rights to certain series. :)|`|gn17EjNHaa	Xbox 360 kicks butt! get it! :D<br>  Wii sucks it`s for little 9 year olds! all the games are really lame. the graphics are terrible!!<br>  Xbox is for more mature audiences.<br>  online play on xbox is amazing its totally worth the money! trust me. :)<br>  ps3 is very nice amazing graphics but is it worth the money? i think not. xbox is fo sho your best option!|`|Vb92NEJtaa	360 deffinetly elite versinon u get a wirless controler headset 20 gig hard drive xbox live adapter what do u get with the ps3? only a wirless controler|`|khDRIKaOaa	I have a wii and i think it's awsome.If i were you i would go for the Xbox Live or Nintendo Wii|`|AA11822877	I own a Wii, an XBox and an XBox 360.<br>  <br>  Graphic quality is amazing on the XBox 360. The console also has a great variety of games.<br>  <br>  The Wii is a different kind of gaming experience. It's more ...active. The Wii system was designed to get people moving and off the coach. I love our Wii and I recommend it for anyone but the gaming experience is entirely different. You actually move your arms, feet, etc. instead of just pushing a keypad and joystick. <br>  <br>  In terms of which one is better, it depends on what you are looking for. If you want a classic gaming experience with amazing graphics and a wide variety of games, I recommend the 360. If you want something new, cutting edge and more interactive, go for a Wii.|`|WbjMz3Pwaa	I have a wii and a ps3, and i never play my wii.<br>  Yes, xbox 360 is cheaper but you have to pay for the internet wire and for xbox live subscription too. <br>  And i prefer the ps3 exclusives such as resistance, motor storm, little big planet, killzone 2, uncharted and mgs4.<br>  Hope i helped.|`|lmg1Ksl9aa	xbox 360 its cheaper and has basically the same graphic as ps3 and all the same games to.|`|PCYV0ldyaa	i would say ps3

x7iYis9Saa	Well at the beginning when you did your training, did u do kick return? You also might b able to edit your roster, but I'm not sure.|`|2GNFQPdmaa	Are you asking, why doesn't the game automatically make him return kicks? Because star running backs in the real NFL aren't kick returners, because it's silly to risk an injury to them on a big, dangerous, endurance-sapping play like a kick return. Special teams is always made up of 2nd and 3rd string players so that the starters don't get worn out or hurt on plays they don't need to be in for.|`|aELTVlQvaa	Very Simple really. Take Brian Westbrook as example he was a great kick and punt returner but it is too risky in case of an injury so it the same in madden. There is away to return kicks with your player though. Change to options so that you play when your superstar is off the field for you play as the team for the kick-off returns and then change it back so you can sim when you are not on the pitch. Anyway when you have changed the option before you pick the play kick return press y or triangle which brings up the subs menu. This should mean your player will return kicks and may even end up being a very succesful returner :) hope this helps|`|sFp88e0Zaa	they usually dont put starters at kick returner <br>  <br>  see here<br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&ssPageName=STRK:MESELX:IT&item=280316795166" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?Vie...</a>
T3nvV9G3aa	Maybe the game is too big for the computers memory.<br>  The Sims 2 Deluxe took 4 GB out of my computer. Double Deluxe is probably worse.
cO10thlnaa	The games are in my opinion, as well as many others, amazing.<br>  It's a very in-depth yet simple turn-based strategy game with near endless replay value. Aside from the main plot, there is the Dark Court which you can get a jury to decide if you can create new characters, unlock extra maps, enhance character abilities etc. You can bribe the jury members as well as beat them into submission. There is also the Item World which is as it states; a world within your items. Here, you complete certain objectives and move "residents" around to upgrade items and enhance their abilities.
2GNFQPdmaa	Well, they are turn-based tactics games. If you're not into long, strategic battles, it doesn't matter how much of the anime is in there, right? Unless you're into things like Advance Wars or Fire Emblem, you're going to hate them.
2GNFQPdmaa	There are craftables that are naxx-ready. Saving up the mats for them might be a real pain, but they're the easy way to go. Between rep gear, craftables, and badge gear you should be in good shape. Also: if your main is for PVE raid content, DO NOT spend badges on heirlooms for your alts. That's what stone keeper shards are for.<br>  <br>  Another recommendation I would have is this: Go to elitist jerks or the wowhead forums or some other reputable source of information to make sure you're using an efficient spec and rotation. <br>  <br>  One more thing: all of the Druid, Warr, DK, and Pally DPS I know just specced tank to get into as many heroics as possible then rolled for off-spec gear. If you can find groups without other plate wearers and you know your tanking this is an easy way to get drops when you can't really put down the deeps.|`|qJNevpELaa	Well, you need to run heroics. Run the ones you need for gear first, and then random ones for more Badges of Heroism. Get the badge items (such as the necklace, trinket, etc). <br>  <br>  Craftable epics are important too, but make sure you're wearing those tabards to get the awesome rep rewards that you get for running heroics while wearing the tabards. <br>  PUG 10 man Naxx, and/or find a guild where you can run Naxx. /pray that items drop for you, and find out the best rotations for your class. <br>  <br>  Maybe even tweak your spec a bit, I know nothing of warriors, I'm a hunter, so yeah.<br>  <br>  Visit the sit I'm gonna link and try to find out how to good dps, but from your Armory you really need to hit the heroics hard and start doing Naxx and Sartharion. <br>  <br>  Good luck. <br>  <br>  and please, if this helped you, in 4 hours choose this as a best answer to reward me! :D|`|98EXXItdaa	I have to disagree with pmjenn85 here.  You don't go tank to gear for dps, you go dps to gear for tank.  If you're not fairly well geared going in as a tank, you're not going to handle heroics.  DPS can get away with being undergeared, but a tank cannot.<br>  <br>  I know nothing about warriors.  But all DPS classes I've played ( I have 3 80 dps ) were all about learning the rotation.  Get some kind of damage meters and try using different tactics and see what difference it makes.  Keep track of where you're getting your damage from, and what skills are getting used the most.  Gear helps, but it's only part of the picture.
AA10233094	ok, when you open up your menu, you will se your party. now, next to everyones name should be an element, such as marta. youll see the yellow bright symbol that stands for light. you must match an element from your characters to an element on the elemental grid, which you'll see in the lower left of the battle screen. you can change the element by using  a spell of the prefered element during battle. when the element of one of the characters in battle match an element on the grid match, they will attack as well as emil.<br>  <br>  such as marta again. use a light spell, and the symbol for light should appear on the grid. then use the unision, and she will attack as well. hope that helps!|`|yjOedbLyaa	well im not sure what you are doing wrong when i use my unison attack marta and my dragon and wolf pet join in the attack which results in maximum damage try using an animal in your party

uctxzjIIaa	I'm not entirely sure what you are asking. The Super Game Boy doesn't reall yupgrade the games at all. It has three effects:<br>  <br>  1) It lets you play Game Boy games on a TV<br>  2) It lets you put a border around the game screen (the games already looked pixelated just taking up about half the TV, so they let you choose a border to put on the rest. Some of the later Game Boy games had a custom border in the cartridge, like Galaga having the artwrok that went around the screen in the actual Galaga arcade cabinet).<br>  3) It lets you change the colors. Game Boy was limited to white, black, and two shades of grey. The Super Game Boy let you change each of those colors to any of I think 32 colors. So when playing Mega Man, you could change light grey to light blue and dark grey to dark blue, and the main character would look right (though that would color everything else blue as well...)<br>  <br>  It's still a regular Game Boy game, and therefore rather limited in what the game could do.|`|N3tr1SYsaa	don't think so just try!!!!!!!!!

7ZrhsPHPaa	You really don't need a big paragraph. The incident at cloud's hometown was a big thing for Shinra. So Hojo would to seal the whole project so they sealed Zack and Cloud after that big battle with Sephiroth. The way fate had it for them, Angeal freed them and they ran for freedom. <br>  <br>  The reason they killed Zack who caused he known too much and he resisted going back to Shinra. As you can see at the end, he died a hero's death. The thing that sucks is the fact that the only group that was willing to help him were the special fighter in the black suits.<br>  <br>  I guess I did give a long paragraph. Lol.<br>  <br>  As for Aerith, She felt when Zack die and she cried. Not realizing that Cloud would fall in the same way Zack did. She also listened to Zack advice and started selling her flowers that grew in the church. The same church where the people were healed of the Mako Virus. Cloud saw Aerith and Zack one last time.
7W5JCf4Naa	Level really doesn't matter. It's your stats, like strength, vitality, spirit, etc. Cheating is also unnecessary. Besides, I don't think cheats exist for crisis core anyway, and they take away the fun of the game.<br>  <br>  Since you're already at the end of the game, I'd suggest you go and do some missions. Well, not some...maybe a lot. That'll help you level up and get better stats.<br>  <br>  If you want to do 99,999 damage, then you'd need to fuse materia and some materia fusion items together to get a Curaga + HP 999% and Costly Punch HP + 999%  to boost your HP up to the max, which is 99,999. The Costly Punch will allow you to do that max damage, as long as you have genji gloves or something that will let you do max damage.<br>  <br>  Focus on leveling up for now, or maybe switching your materia and equipment around to find the best combination.|`|FYsbOrLoaa	You can't do damage like that on your level. You have to cheat to be like them.

weMxzwXXaa	Your gamerscore is made up of all of the points you earn for earning achievements in Xbox 360 and Xbox Live Arcade games. Each achievement has a certain number of points associated with it so your gamerscore is a way to show other people what games you have played and what you have accomplished. Each 360 game has around 1000 points to earn while arcade games have 200.<br>  <br>  Gamerscores are a fun way to compare your devotion to your Xbox 360 with other people, but a high score doesn't necessarily mean you are a better gamer than someone else. Some games, such as King Kong, Fight Night Round 3, and all of the other sports games, have very easy achievements so it is easy to earn all of the points that particular game has to offer. Other games like Perfect Dark Zero, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, and Burnout Revenge give you very hard goals for achievements and require real dedication to get all but the easiest points. Once developers get into the groove of creating achievements, things will get better, but for now don't take gamerscores too seriously.|`|AoxkInedaa	its your gamerscore when you get achievements your number goes up achievements can be awarded to you while in game by say... beating halo3 or unlocking a map for something

Halo 3: ODST will contain the Heroic, Legendary and Mythic Map Packs as well as 3 new maps.|`|3eQhA8nraa	i don't think so... it should come with a code on a paper like xbl cards.<br>  <br>  nice try|`|qSQ9dxOPaa	you will be able to rent the standard edition<br>  <br>  and the mythic map pack will be the new maps that come with<br>  halo 3 recon,<br>  <br>  not for halo wars

And finally, try making sure WiiConnect24 is on. Those are the only things I can think of for why me personnally is recieving these messages, so maybe it will work for your friend.
rTcBGe9eaa	Well I haven't got it yet (tommorow) but you should get a free live trial card, scratch the silver covering off and there should be a code for the mythic map pack and 48 live hour free trial. Thats what it was like with Gears 2 LE. Hope I helped.

P6lYtjMIaa	aight halo....theres a halo 1 combat evolved, halo 2 , and a halo 3. i love them all.<br>  the games story line is basically about a superspartan dude named Masterchief. hes a kickbutt kinda guy that every one porbably sees as a role model, maybe y ur bf plays it but prob not. masterchief lives his life fighting covenant, brutes, and the flood. these are all alien type creatures. masterchief works with the unsc and they fight the alien guyz from taking over their planet earth. so...the object of the game is 2 kill! kill! killlll!....i know definetely though y ur bf likes it....u ready? i got one word for u lol MULTIPLAYER! the games multiplayer is beyond outstanding for all three of the games and it is so addicting and stuff. i mean theres so much arsenal(guns) and a bunch of action like "omg i just made a headshot, or omg i just stuck that noob with a grenade!" u cant blame ur bf for liking the game. its just plain cool witha ll the vehicles and teamplaying action!|`|2k3DYSiZaa	halo is an amazing gaming experience, wether talented, tactical, or new to the FPS genre, its story line is gripping, its gameplay is solid, its an addicting game. <br>  <br>  praise aside: you play as a cybernetic soldier in a distopian future, where the human race is besieged by a group of aliens called the covenant, the covenant see the human race as an abomination, and want to exterminate them, using this relic weapon*which is a planet sized structure, shaped like a ring, called "halo"* built by the forerunners, who the covenant see as their god. halo is actually designed to wipe out all sentient life in the universe, to combat a second enemy known as the flood<br>  <br>  so you wander around killing crazy *** aliens, or your friends in PVE, or your friends in co op...if you're that kind of person.|`|895nCJWnaa	Well, you basically stop aliens from destroying the entire universe. The reason why people would want to play it is because they're first person shooter fans. Other games from this Genre are Half-Life and Counter-Strike.
HTZMJOSXaa	It is probably something to do with your internet connection.  If your internet goes out, even for a tiny amount of time, you will be dropped from the race.  Then it subtract points as if you came in last place.
lPRPh7TBaa	2 things: There are no cheats on Runescape.<br>  <br>  It's probably refering to runescape classic
gF1qkAJJaa	Sweet game for sure. The graphics are great and i actually love the game play it makes the game way more challenging online as well as in single player. I actually didn't change the controls to alt 2, i did in the demo but found out i play much better with the default controls. nonetheless the game is great and i loove that it sets itself apart from most other FPS|`|GFAgYMYsaa	I played it all night and I also find it a good game.  I also use Alt 2 controls because its more like cod and i'm good at that game.  the guns have recoil a lot but it takes getting used to.  If you could answer me back.  Is using alternate 2 controls alright or do the normal controls make the gameplay better?|`|sSDJLUzOaa	i havent played it yet i think it will be a great game and it will beat out cod 4 by a long shot|`|BZm2XdLxaa	1 word-------------------------Amazing|`|wV1xDq1yaa	its amazing mate but the control sucks man i mean it it really dispointed me i mean if the control was good then ill give it 10/10 but really the control keep holding it to 9/10<br>  i wont talk about graphics coz really its the best graphic iv ever seen on a game|`|RxSe8Mtjaa	this is a great game. I've played through the first three levels and the graphics are great. The gameplay is fun too. The only thing I don't like a re the controls, but I'm getting used to that.  <br>  <br>  p.s. good username
x7iYis9Saa	I like polar white because it's the original|`|Y5RrnswGaa	You should get the Crimson or The White one.<br>  The White one lets you see dirt spots but its hard to see in the Crimson<br>  Dont get Colbat, thats for girls <br>  and dont get onyx one|`|yjOedbLyaa	I like the crimson because its a mix of my 2 favorite colors red and black resulting in a perfect effect that stuns you every time you look at it

It is pointless to put it into HP recovery because of the new item, Beach chair(+50 HP every 10 seconds), unless you are also working on endure.<br>  In the face of the new item pain reliever(+30 Weapon Def for 30 min, 1200 meso at omega sector) which actually conflicts with the use of iron body. So you have two choices.<br>  <br>  The options below will decide what happens to your character at level 60 and above:<br>  -If you want more DEFENSE +3 to endure +2 to Iron Body.<br>  -If you want more RECOVERY (AND OFFENSE(Level 60+)) +5 to Endure<br>  -If you want more DEFENSE (AND OFFENSE(Level 60+)) +5 to Endure.<br>  -If you want more DEFENSE (AND RECOVERY(Level 60+)) +5 to Endure.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck :D|`|30GklpTYaa	First, you should put some points on 'HP recovery', only enough so that you can max 'max HP' - this is so you can have the highest amount of hp possible for your warrior. Well, you can put some points onto endure if you want so that you could heal while on ropes and ladders, but you don't need to. Next, power strike and slash blash should be maxxed, it depends whether you train in areas with large mbos or not. Either way, but should get maxed. You'll only have a couple points left (5 points left, unless you already put some points onto endure), afterwards, you should either put the remaining points onto endure or hp recovery.

Watch out though, there is a very good chance they are fakes. From my experiences, 2 out of 10 have been real. If you can't get in Redd's you need an invitation. Try going to the city, go up the stairs and take a sharp left. Knock on the door. After the talk, go back to your town and talk to some villager and they should talk about giving you an invitation.

Maybe Call of Duty World at War.  That game is a pretty good online fps.  House of the Dead Overkill is also very adult and good for playing with friends but has no online play.|`|fGaa8yc9aa	Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess and Animal Crossing City Folk and you will not be disapointed.|`|or9ajX7Maa	Resident evil 4, the best game for adult player.|`|d7zvx1x8aa	The Wii sports range without a doubt.|`|Nl5PZXK4aa	I think that wii play and wii sports is for a casual game player---<br>  By the way - - if you have the nintendo channel for the will - you can browse games online!|`|KnSUc3n1aa	Call of duty World At War<br>  (not sure if Fallout 3 is out for wii)<br>  You could Download porn -.-|`|ewomLk55aa	Wii Fit might be good too :) Get to loose some weight and have fun|`|AA12220250	dont know, the wii has boring games, the wii sport is ok, it gets boring fast.

It's called the Jasper build.  google it.  I'll bet you a million dollars the reduced price xbox you see online are the OLD versions that are susceptible to RROD.  my advice: avoid.  Earn some extra money and go buy a jasper.

If i were you, i would wait and keep that wii of yours because at least you have a gaming console that you can play games on with your friends. i bought a 360 around christmas and paid about 200 for it, then 20 for a hdd, and i still need all these accessories and more controllers. what irks me most is having to pay for the interet service to play COD4 while the people on PC and PS3 can play for free.|`|e9695c75152e6d757a83f3e1f8134384aa	sell the wii the xbox 360 is by far the best system, it has loads of great games and xbox live is awesome for playing online, the wii has about 2 good games

XrGFZ2LJaa	Hey again Havoc.<br>  <br>  * The Intel Pentium 4 running at 3.00GHz is decent, but next time you buy a PC, make sure you opt for an AMD CPU chip instead - they are better suited for gaming, because they calculate faster.<br>  <br>  * 1022 MB of physical memory (RAM) is the bare minimum for running the latest modern games, and it will struggle with Empire: Total War, which seems to be much more demanding in every field. I recommend you buy another two sticks of 1 Gig RAM and have them installed.<br>  <br>  * As before, the ATI RADEON X300 won't cut it. It's to old and obsolete to endure such a heavy task, and you experienced this with the demo. Again, a NVIDIA 8600 GT or ATI RADEON HD 3200 will work a treat for you now, and in the future.<br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  There's simply no alternative except upgrading. The problem for gamers worldwide is the expensive payments every 2 years (on average) to keep up to date with new titles. Due to the economic crisis, prices have plummeted, and this is the best chance for you to capitalise. Computer parts are being sold with massive discounts globally - hundreds of Euros, Australian/American dollars or British pounds less!

It sounds like you guys really enjoy RB 2 and it is something that everyone can play if you get Halo Wars that is just you. So what are you more into? Have you played Strategy games before, have you played the demo? Maybe that is part of the answer, play the demo and see how you would like it and decide after that. I would lean toward the RB 2 but that is just me. My family and I really enjoy it and play it almost every weekend. There is my 2 cents, good luck|`|8lRRigDtaa	DUDE HALO WARS!!!!

3cIx5DjNaa	Currently player 2 stats dont save.  The makers of R2 have publicly stated that they were waiting for Sony to release some new firmware that would enable P2 stats to save, as the firmware available at the time of launch wouldnt allow it(not sure why or how myself).  Read this on their own website <br>  <br>  QUOTED<br>  (Now you may be asking, “But what about adding the option to save the second player’s character progress?” Truth be told, it required a certain PS3 firmware that wasn’t available at the time of Resistance 2’s release. We now have that firmware and are currently working to implement the feature. As soon as it’s ready, we’ll get it out to you)<br>  <br>  Whether they will be compensated or leveled up due to lost XP is anyones guess

AA11084698	You want to downgrade your PSP.<br>  <br>  To downgrade your PSP to custom firmware you must…<br>  <br>  1) First format your memory stick (Whether your PSP is a slim or a fat).  [Warning: Formatting your Memory stick will delete EVERYTHING on the Memory stick. I recommend that you backup all of your files by copying them to your computer. You can put everything back later]<br>  <br>      a. To format your memory stick, just plug your PSP into the computer using the USB cable.<br>      b. Click “My Computer”<br>      c. Right-click your PSP. (On the computer, you will see it as a “removable disk”. On my computer, it’s called ‘Removable Disk (H:)’ However, yours may be different)<br>      d. Scroll down and click format…<br>      e. Make sure you select : File system: FAT32<br>      f. Click Format.<br>  2) Now your memory stick should be cleared of all its files.<br>      a. Keeping your PSP plugged into the computer, Click my Computer.<br>      b. Open to your PSP. (Now you should see nothing, since you formatted it.)<br>      c. Now, create a new folder and name it “PSP”. [Without the quotes and all capital letters]<br>      d. Now double click PSP and create a new folder inside of PSP. Name it “GAME” [Without the quote and all capital letters. It is “GAME”. Do not name it “GAMES”. There is no “S”.]<br>      e. Now download this file:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/96630083/pan3xx_Rev3.rar" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/96630083/pan...</a><br>  <br>  To extract this file, you will need a program like “WinRAR”.

Now once you downloaded it, Extract the folder onto the desktop. The folder is called PAN3XX_R3.<br>      g. Once you have the folder, move this folder into the “GAME” Folder you created a few minutes ago.<br>      h. Now download this file:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/96635073/150.PBP" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/96635073/150...</a><br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/96632174/340.PBP" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/96632174/340...</a><br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/96636306/371.PBP" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/96636306/371...</a><br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/96638006/380.PBP" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/96638006/380...</a><br>  <a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/195156516/UPDATE.PBP" rel="nofollow">http://rapidshare.com/files/195156516/UP...</a><br>  <br>  <br>       i. Now place all of these files into the “root of your PSP”. That just means to place all the files into your PSP. Do not put them into the PSP file. Do not put them into the GAME folder. Just put them into the PSP.<br>      j. Now, disconnect your PSP from the computer.<br>      k.  Go into the GAMES underneath the PSP menu and click memory stick. You should see a program called PANDORA INSTALLER<br>      l. Launch the program<br>      m. Ignore all the weird messages and just find your way to the main menu.<br>      n. Go down to “Install a DDCv7 MagicStick (For Fat + Slim) and click it<br>      o. After it finishes installing, go back to the main menu and go down to battery options.<br>      p. Click it and chose to “make battery Pandora”<br>      q. After that is complete you can quit.<br>      r. VOW-LAH! You have a magic memory stick and a Pandora battery.<br>      s. Now, take out the battery from the back of your PSP. <br>      t. While holding down the “Down-arrow button”, carefully put the Battery back into the PSP.<br>      u. Once the PSP turns on, you should be on a screen where you can downgrade your PSP.<br>      v. Install 4.01 M33 Firmware.<br>      w. Now you have custom firmware. Congrats.  <br>      x.

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Didn't you just answer your own question?  If Walmart is going to sell you the game before the release date, why don't you go to Walmart and ask them to get the game from the back?<br>  <br>  I don't think any store will sell you the game before the release date.

V7pXzNKNaa	The * means special timing. Depending on the move, you have to push the second part of the combo when the * occurs. You have to find out yourself, when the special timing is though. For example, Superman's groundpound kombo (which is so annoying) you press down down circle and immediately you press the corrosponding button(s). I hope I helped, good luck and farewell. Some kombo's can be tricky.

J3iTNFsGaa	7 out of 10, it's okay, but can't beat any of the new decks (light sworn, monarch, whatever) You have too many cards and probably won't get the right draw when you need it. Dark Magician is so bad it's worthless, unless you can summon him with his apprentice or with something like a hero emerges or ancient runes, and even that's not so great. Also, Ookazi can be replaced with poison of the old man, or ring of destruction. I really don't know some of the cards in your deck, so i'm not so detailed, but hope this helps.Reaper of the cards sucks, replace it with something like penguin soldier. you could kill giant orc for gene warped werewolf, 200 less, but no effect with it, and it can kill 1900 atk monsters. Also, there's a chainsaw something it's awesome 2400 atk, the only thing bad about it is the effect. Also you could throw in some cyber dragons. I'm just doing some general stuff,not much.|`|f6rHiAe2aa	I kind of like it 7/10...I have a Reptile/Alien deck that includes the newest cards from the Japanese Raging Battle....I also have a Alien Synchro: Cosmic Fortress Gol'Gar....I also have the Alien version of the Crush Card named Planetary Contimination Virus...which works best with Mass Hypnosis!|`|on8MjVTcaa	Well, 1 - 10 is -9.

127766aa9c415a074e2f444c6c56e4b4aa	The series date on a note is the date the note was authorized not the date it was printed. They add a letter like series 1988A when there is a new signature. The 1996 series was printed through 1999 but all say series 1996. The only way to get a date a note was printed is to have a listing of the serial numbers that were printed and look the numbers up. Such lists exist for modern notes, but not the real old ones. It means little to know what year anyway. The 1996 notes should have an FW on them for all were printed at the Fort Worth Texas plant. they are too new to have collector value as of yet.|`|xtosLCS5aa	no , and I think they wouldn't be worth more than regular 20 bills , they're just regular 20 dollars that got one mistake , but if you were talking about 2 dollars bill that would be different.|`|oncXuOSCaa	Well, I don't know. I've never heard of that- and besides, it might be hard to value them, seeing as they really could be just from 1996.<br>  I would go to a coin collector and ask to have them appraised. But don't tell them that you are looking to sell- if you do, they are more likely to offer you a very low price for them if they are worth anything. I would just tell them that they are of high sentimental value, but you would like to know how much it's worth. This way, you'll be more likely to get a true appraisal.
ZiMkydtHaa	They are not out yet. They will be out late February or early March 2009. They will cost about $5-10. There will also be a music pack after and that will be free.|`|4oyDKNHAaa	they have not released them yet for the 360 so im assuming that they will release it the same time as them, im assuming that treyarch is going to allow the release of the map pack at the same time
FPsMtmThaa	What the? Why would that be weird?  It's 2009.  Pretty girls who play on the 360 are a dime a dozen.  Nothing weird, unusual, special or rare about that.|`|oQ5oKILHaa	Yea it is weird.

e0Oa5Vg4aa	No, that won't work.  You'll need a new controller.<br>  <br>  If you are playing GH3 on the 360 then it must be a Guitar Hero controller, the Rock Band controllers are not compatible with GH3 (though they work fine with GH:WT)|`|3eQhA8nraa	ps2 guitar does not work with the 360|`|yIsdNNDeaa	I doubt that the PS2 GH3 controller will work with GH4/RB on the 360. Even with an adapter. It's worth a try though. I think you'll have to buy a new controller, or, buy an XBOX 360 version of the GH3 controller and yu shud be able to use that wiv GH4/RB (im not 100% sure, but im 90%) itll be cheaper than buying a brand new GH4 one too.|`|cooRrVzVaa	well i never tried it myself but it does make sense. maybe it will read and you'll be able to play with it. but who knows....... you should try it out. but i would recommend you buy the real thing just incase it dosent work =)|`|GgpUmFwbaa	unfortunitly that does not work. we have both in the house and they are not compatable.

0dbbb948636ec1c95b44b9e48d12e2cfaa	I took a picture for you. You can view it here.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://craftwhenyoucan.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://craftwhenyoucan.blogspot.com/</a>|`|154dzJ1Faa	If you looked closely at a crochet stitch, it forms a kind of V at the top.  See it?  You may have to turn that row a bit to see it.<br>  <br>  When you crochet, you sometimes push the hook through only one strand, or both strands of that V.  Usually, in the normal course of making stitches, you push the hook through both strands, or under the whole V of the previous row.  But for some special effects, you use only one strand -- either the "front" loop or the "back" loop.  Can you tell which is which?<br>  <br>  If you use only one loop, you tend to put more tension on one side of the work, and sometimes you get a bit of distortion.  Sometimes, on the next row, you counteract those forces, and it pulls in the other direction for a balanced look.<br>  <br>  These are all such small subtle things, but they do make a difference in your work.  Knowing what each stitch does is the basis for a creative craftsperson -- you can make these stitches work FOR you instead of having to fight them all the time.<br>  <br>  I know -- more than you needed to know.

The answer is conditional: IF by capturing the king will not undergo a new check, then he can. IF capturing the piece will put the king under check again, then he cannot. Say a bishop checks the king. If there is a queen behind the bishop then the king cannot capture because the queen will cause a new check. If there is no queen (or any other piece protecting the bishop, then he can capture. It does not mean he will because sometimes it is better to move away or to protect itself behind a new piece.|`|fPavekfeaa	Yes a king in check can capture the piece that has him in check providing the move is legal IE it won't put the king in check again.<br>  <br>  Technically a check mate is when the King can not legally move because every move he makes would place him into check.|`|hOC1Wrbhaa	absolutely, as long as no other piece covers the one the king needs to take...|`|AA10566329	yes, as long as the piece isn't protected by another piece|`|WRL6VcrAaa	surely yes|`|N33PlPwHaa	yes|`|mPCNUXLCaa	yes

A little bit of everything.|`|yy122maTaa	definitly take a rogue so u get a little taste of everything. they are great for pvp.  if u are in alliance, make a a gnome rogue, horde make a blood elf rogue.|`|3CxoAfbCaa	I agree, I would roll the rogue also. since u already have a dps/tank toon.  Plus the sneaking around is great fun.  you could also get the bind on account gear for your rogue with your hunter/dk.  you won't have to worry about upgrading your gear/weapons the whole time you level.  Enjoy the rogue.|`|GI3t6ZYMaa	i think you should make a rogue since they deal quicker damage. i think theyre best in pvp and pve for melee, cs, etc. go rogue ;)

43zXRpLYaa	Don't be scared, it's all in the dark. It really doesn't go very fast. Try to sit in the middle of the back if you're scared. If you want to see what it looks like with the lights on, on Main Street next to the annual pass center is the Main Street Opera House. There is a bunch of pictures and Disney stuff in there and one of them is a model of Space Mountain. You can also search on YouTube for videos of Space Mountain with the lights on, there's a lot of them.|`|su37vnIXaa	omg! I went on that this summer in Disneyworld.  I hated it. I usually like roller coasters but this 1 was totally un-enjoyable. its completly dark & you feel like you going to run into stuff . you cant see anything ... i'd never go on it again. but thats just me. my dad thought he was goona fall out but my brother loved it.|`|2n6HSiF0aa	the top speed is only about 25 mph. they say it is faster, but my english teacher has been behind the scenes and she saw it running with the lights on lol. try to sit in the middle. just have fun, and remember tht more people die in car accidents than they do on roller coasters.|`|AnzssI8Zaa	basically, space mountain just whirls around in a circle while dropping slightly, then there are some larger drops (only a couple feet, but it feels like more because the ride goes pretty fast), and you should expect some changes in direction between left and right, though these don't happen too often. You'll know you're at the end when you end up in a red tunnel with lots of light in it, and that's when you get your picture taken. It's pretty easy to handle, just realize that it does go pretty fast!|`|cCAGstnpaa	It is boring in my opinion. I think you will love it. When I was afraid of roller coasters, that was my favorite ride! But now I am used to the rides at Six Flags.|`|JH2P2AMsaa	ooo space mountain is fun!<br>  its not bad at all...im always scared of roller coasters too..but its dark and stuff..but really fun!|`|JLu7C24Jaa	Umm, its not really that fast it has like alot of twist and turns. But if ur claustrophobic it will suck because you have to wait in line in like this tiny enclosed hallway........ Also, there is only one person per row. In other words, you have to sit alone, and there are only people in front and behind you (unless you are in the front or the back). Check out some videos on youtube or something of people riding it. It might be hard to see though, because (did i mention?) its in the dark. Sounds like someone who hates roller coasters worst nightmare! Look, I hope you don't get sick tomorrow and remember -- It can't be that bad if you are in Disney Land!|`|mVpVzodEaa	Its sooo fun.. but i was on it when i was 8, 9 years ago.. so this discription is from then lol idk if it has changed.but...<br>  <br>  you get up there and sit 3 people to a car i think, front, back, middle ways. and its pretty dark the whole time except for stars and stuff so you dont really know whats coming except when you go into a tunnel and then after is the big drop im pretty sure. but its nothing like really steep or anything. just go on and you'll love it!|`|0xmN2R44aa	Space mountain is just a roller coaster that is very dark and it just moves you around. So don't worry! There is nothing to be scared of ! Take it from me who is a real scary cat at roller coasters and don't worry, It'll be over before you know it ;)|`|FAlZFYwnaa	It's really fast and it jerks your head around a lot.

I apologize for being 10 minutes late for the job interview we scheduled today.” After the person has admitted to not being Mr. Waldo, look embarrassed and look around the diner and try to search for the real Mr. Waldo.  Pretend to point at him, but then decide (outloud) that you don’t care about the job position anymore and run out of the diner. Purpose: to leave the fake Mr. Waldo perplexed and confused.<br>   <br>  <br>  -walk around and pick a couple to run up to.

Same hapened to my friends guitar hero. the mic probably just broke after 6 songs, u were probably lycky enough for it to work 6 songs. goto wal-mart or other stores and u can get a new mic. i think. i no they sell them. if not goto nintendo.com and try to order one online. if they have it.if not email them and ask them were u can get it. plz vote mine best answer.

It's essentially a free enemy monster, being that Spirits just return to your hand at the end of the turn anyway, and can get you some big monsters like Stardust and JD in the process.  Also run more copies of Mirror of Yata and Mausoleum of the Emperor while taking out Double Summon.<br>  <br>  Now for monsters.  Take out The Tricky and throw in another Izanagi.

The punkbuster kicks out laggers to keep everyone else from slowing down.<br>  <br>  To fix lag, you have to speed up your computer, obviously. If you can open it up, try vacuuming all the dust out of it. That usually helps, depending on how dirty it is. Other than that, the only way to speed up your computer is to get more RAM or a better processor. And those cost $$.|`|kxVnFHtPaa	Ram is pretty cheap in some places.
d0f5RJ8Jaa	AnswerDu has already given you some great ideas :-)) and i like the scrabble tile idea too.<br>  since you are interested in recycling, here are a few more -<br>  - all the plastic & some other components from your old electronic gadgets like computer, mobile, remote, etc. If you have a proper cutter, fine; otherwise, heat an old knife & use it to scour through in desired shape. [and as mentioned, cover with scrap fabric if they are not cut evenly or smoothly.<br>  - any plastic buckets, tupperware, etc. Use the above technique.<br>  - shells<br>  - seeds of watermelon, etc.<br>  - bunch up your used aluminium foil into cute spheres, adding a loop at one end for the attachment.<br>  - broken pieces of glass, ceramic, tiles, vases, .... bevel the edges or cover with fabric or glue satin ribbon or embroidery floss or yarn as couching along the edges.<br>  - old plastic bags, bunched up into spheres & covered & tied with burst balloon bits.<br>  - lego & other bits & pieces from kids' toys.<br>  - artificial flowers - you can use the smaller flowers as is. for larger flowers, you could use the petals folded & tucked decoratively; or the centre without petals. <br>  - twigs collected from your garden or during your walk. they shouldn't be too brittle tho'. or use pieces of swizzle sticks, toothpicks, wooden skewer sticks, ballpoint pen rifles....since they are thin, tie them in bundles & use.<br>  - plastic cutlery that you get with take-home food<br>  - nuts & bolts & screws<br>  - scrap wool or string - dip entire length into glue & roll into balls, with a little length of loop hanging out. leave to dry.<br>  <br>  hope these inspire even more creative ideas<br>  all the very best & have fun :-))|`|5vgnrvcmaa	the cookies I tried to make yesterday.|`|0RBiVF20aa	Almost anything with the right tools! You can get specialty drill bits online for this type of drilling but you can use round pieces of glass (like aquarium glass) thin stones, coins, quartz, multiple sheets of paper glued together or to paper board (book board), old jewelry (think pins or brooches and earrings), and of course, don't forget you can fabric cover any existing button with a bottom loop. All you need to do is take a circular scrap of fabric, hand stitch a running stitch around the outside, and pull it to gather it around the button, and tie it off. I've done loads of custom buttons that way. Have fun!

"Putting a creature into play tapped and attacking" is setting a characteristic of the creature (in this case, attacking), is not actually declaring an attack.|`|Yb32iebMaa	I'm pretty sure that ninjitsu doesn't count as declaring an attack. It comes into play "tapped and attacking". The card puts itself into play already attacking, so you don't have to declare its attack.

In fact at some online casinos that don't have limits it will work perfectly as long as you have an unlimited bankroll.<br>  <br>  But trust me, don't try it, it will only end in tears. I have just started using this <a href="http://aroulettewinner.blogspot.com/2009/03/roulette-systems.html" rel="nofollow">http://aroulettewinner.blogspot.com/2009...</a> and I am having some success. It is basically employing a number of systems at the same time. You can do this on paper but as they offer a free trial (1 hr) and a money back guarantee (30 days) why would you bother. Give it a crack just start out small and be sensible.|`|Xxviy63Paa	You can't win over time at Roulette, no matter what you do. This is because the payoff does not match the odds.<br>  <br>  To explain simply, imagine a roulette wheel with 21 numbers. and nothing else but numbers. You bet on 1. Each spin has a 1 in 21 chance of getting your number; the odds would be written as 1:20.<br>  <br>  A fair payoff would give you $20 every time you win with a $1 bet. Over time, you'd lose $1 20 of 21 times, and gain $20 1 of 21 times, for a net expectation of zero.<br>  <br>  I'm not going to go over the math cause real roulette is more complicated, but it's basically like if that simple version above gives $19 for the win instead of $20. Most of the reason for this is the no-number slots. The rules are complicated enough that people don't realize they don't get a fair payoff. They see numbers, and figure the payoff matches the numbers, but there's more slots there than numbers.<br>  <br>  As for blackjack, you can win at blackjack, but you gotta be good. And you gotta be experienced. And if you are good enough to be a professional blackjack player, casinos will regulate your stakes. Easy enough for them to do. Even a pro can make no better than 10 percent profit on a good day, and can have bad luck just the same as everyone else.<br>     If you practice and play at a table with tough rules on the house, you might be able to make a bit of money. But not a whole lot. You won't walk out with twice what you walked in with, unless you've got a whole lot of luck on your side. It's a slow game.<br>    If you want to learn a game where you can make a lot of money in a short time, poker would be it, but for the first few years you'll more likely lose a lot of money in a short time instead. <br>    Best way to make money is still to work.|`|XA7adCMFaa	You can not win at "gambling" the casino edge prevents this.  Only table games of poker or blackjack (skill games) can be beaten in the long run.<br>  <br>  Blackjack requires at least,perfect strategy called basic strategy. Then card counting after mastering basic strategy.  Strategy cards are available in gift shop and can be used at the table in many casinos.  <br>  <br>  Poker also is a skill game and requires expert play to win in long run.  Many good books on market.  Start start at beginner level and work up.<br>  <br>  Free lessons and low cost workbooks for both poker & blackjack available on my website.<br>  www.thegamblingschool.com<br>  <br>  Forgot about the other games in the casino for winning in the long run.

B9JwxyRfaa	First things first, Dark Armed Dragon >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Dark Nephthys<br>  <br>  Your trap lineup is also a mishmesh of random cards.  Most decks pack in this:<br>  <br>  3 Solemn Judgment/Dark Bribe<br>  1 Mirror Force<br>  1 Torrential Tribute<br>  <br>  along with three of some other trap card, like Bottomless Trap Hole, Phoenix Wing Wind Blast, Royal Oppression, or Compulsory Evacuation Device.<br>  <br>  Get an Emergency Teleport in there; gives Krebons more speed.  Definitely take out Kuriboh, and if you're running Spirit Reaper, Marshmallon, and CyDra, add in some more Monarchs (Raiza, Caius, and Thestalos are the best ones.

y02PZj22aa	Mark the beginning of the round.  That marker will already be there when you add the other three markers to separate the 100 stitches into four groups.  Then, when you start decreasing, decrease one stitch before and after each marker, including the start-of-round marker.  Then ignore the instruction about the back seam--there won't be a back seam.<br>  <br>  Addendum:  In knitting hats, one most often finds the decreases occurring on alternate rows.  On this hat, the decreases occur on *each* decrease row (each row after you change back to Color A, knit one round, and place markers in the next round).  Thus, it will take 11 rounds of K2tog before and after each marker to decrease from 100 stitches to 12 stitches.|`|154dzJ1Faa	You can convert any pattern from flat into circular knitting.  In this case, with fairly generic directions, you don't have to do any converting.  You would just cast-on, join, and knit according the directions you have already given us here.  Rib is the same circularly or flat -- learn to read your knitting to know which stitch to use.  Use stitch markers (very important) and follow the directions exactly.  Decrease is the same in any direction.  You will be doing the decrease rounds on every second round (I believe) rather than every round. Check those instructions once more.  And the rest should be just fine!

AA12042448	If you mean you want socks that can be knit on single-point needles, you may not realize what you'd end up with.  You'll have to have a seam somewhere, for one thing, and you can't shape a heel at all for another.  This will be a very awkward sock to wear, you have to understand.  <br>  <br>  Instead, I would suggest either making something else (slippers, perhaps, which can easily be knit on single-point needles) or learning to use the equipment necessary to knit socks the regular way.  For tutorials and other helps (and patterns on various skill levels) I would suggest trying a yarn manufacturer's website.  My favorites are www.coatsandclark.com and www.lionbrand.com, but use any you know.  Yarn manufacturers want to keep us knitting happily along, of course, so we will keep buying yarn.

f3b6c192f7f7186b48a7ef3f38930bfaaa	Shiny pokémon can be found just about anywhere on all of the current Pokémon games, but the chances of finding one are roughly 1 in 8000, though I'm not 100% sure of the exact odds.<br>  <br>  To give you a general idea, I've been playing the third generation games since they've come out and I've only seen three shiny pokémon.  the first was on Leaf Green, when I decided to buy the Magikarp near Mt. Moon just so I could get a Gyarados, and it was shiny.  The second was also on Leaf Green, and it was Mewtwo.  The third was on Sapphire, and it was a Zigzagoon.<br>  <br>  Oh, and by the way.  It is perfectly possible for you to have a shiny starting pokémon.  It is also possible for the Poochyena that you fight at the beginning of Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald to be shiny.  It's also possible for Wally's Ralts to be a shiny.  It all depends on luck.|`|AA12144055	Its completly random, they're very rarily seen and you can't really do anything to increase your chance of finding one.  however, if you use gameshark you can get them, but its very dangerous for your game...|`|26edcea1c2c53362fab20cde4589f766aa	well, you have to find them yourself, but its like looking for a needle in a haystack,a very large one,but just to tell you, i caught a shiny goldbat and a shiny lairon in victory road in Emerald, so i guess its similar|`|7b3b38fdde0990ea059851875526834faa	you have to look the chances are about 8000-1<br>  the chances are better if you put a starmie/staru in the front of party|`|d91bb08e4c6efdf3534e69fb86da6408aa	catching a shiny pokemon is almost mpossible. u have a REALLY REALLY small chance of finding one. u can find one anywhere

You search emulators on a search engine. ( I like <a href="http://www.emulator-zone.com/)" rel="nofollow">http://www.emulator-zone.com/)</a> If it is a popular console, they are likely to have it. You download the emulator, and install it or set it up. Now that you have the emulator set up you can begin getting roms. search roms of go to romhustler.net. This websote has the most, and best roms out there. Download the roms to a specific location, then put them in the desegnated forlder that the emulator provided. (it is possible that there isnt any specific folder, if not just put it in a place you will remember). After this, open the emulator, and go to file, and click open rom. Then you select the downloaded rom you want to play. Then it plays it.|`|AA10539237	Emulators are software that is able to simulate a console like Super Nintendo or GameBoy or any other.

1f98483c8379cefb4835d42011d464c5aa	It sounds like you should go to a book publisher. Go to the bookstore and look at pop-up or other similar books, Make a note of who the publisher is. Submit photos of your book by notarized letter stating that it is your design, and see if they will publish it.<br>  <br>  Or, you could get a loan and have it self-published. Just do an internet search for "vanity press" and many will pop up.<br>  .

dQBAqXCPaa	That's a rather personal question. I'll tell you about some and then I'll state my favorites. First I'm going to tell you about the browser based MMORPGs, then I'll mention somewhere you can see the downloadable.<br>  To play games in flash, there are Dragon Fable and Adventure Quest (In both you have to pay to have full access to the game, and notice that Dragon Fable is still under construction and that it's hard for non-members to login into AQ). There are also those community based flash games (that some people consider to be MMORPGs) that are becoming really popular: Gaia Online (that I already played and that is really cool), ClubPenguin, PuzzlePirates, and i think that Habbo goes the same way; in all of this games you create an avatar and play games like fishing to get money and personalize those avatars.<br>  There’s also the pure browser based ones: Tibia is a fairly popular game, BiteFight and Knightfight are OK. Travian is a strategy MMOG, also pretty good. There’s also pokemon crater (but it has a lots of publicity) and, my personal favorite, FallenSword (it’s much like pokemoncrater, only that it doesn’t have lots of publicity, and has a guild system that stimulate interaction, not to mention the lottery and the auction system).<br>  The downloadable... well, i think it's harder to speak about them. I'll also give you a link for the "List of free MMORPGs" on wikipedia, where you can see the downloadable games out there (in this list you can read about other browser based MMORPGs as well). Take a look at the websites and check the screenshots, maybe you'll find some that interest you. My favorites are MapleStory, Anarchy Online, Monsters and Me, Flyff and Silk Road. Seems like Rappelz is also pretty good.<br>  See you.|`|TqFM3suOaa	The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar<br>  Guild Wars|`|2wlUTv2jaa	www.rpdragon.com, its called legend of the green dragon and it's a text based MMORPG it is so much fun you should try it|`|3mGqBWVKaa	Tales of Pirates|`|bVO91CSvaa	there is some put trust me they are sooooooo gay|`|nszupULeaa	WORLD OF WARCRAFT!!!!!|`|AA12299742	Most would say World of Warcraft,<br>  but since I've never played that game I would say Runescape.<br>  And if you have a Xbox 360, try Phantasy Star Online($10 a month)<br>  Or tey Final Fantasy for 360(it takes forever to load the first time you play)<br>  Hope this helps.|`|MPfx0Lspaa	I think Guild Wars is the best. You buy the game, install it, and you DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR ONLINE TIME! I've never tried it, but it looks very good, the Final Fantasy game for online play (I don't remember what it is called...)|`|UwnWNy0Eaa	www.darkswords.com

AA10817230	Try GameFaQ
moOh4HXpaa	The games tend to be region free (nothing to do with PAL, NTSC etc) As for this game, well I purchased an english one from the US and they use NTSC, not what the UK use, and it works fine for me. Absolutely perfect!<br>  <br>  So you will have no problem in getting this to work for your DS!<br>  Enjoy the game, it's fantastic!|`|IqlPDDxKaa	PAL is a broadcast standard, and not a region encoding. As neither connect to the TV it's not relevant.

8KabegVuaa	press r and then turn which way u want to go. then keep pressing left-right-left-right fast and rapidly. first the flames should turn blue. go longer and then it should turn red. thats when u let go and u should have a turbo boost|`|sVsOELUEaa	Slide then press side to side till the sparks change color<br>  then let go of r and you will boost|`|4d88122c1fb0b42cacd8560cce20937faa	I think you have to powerslide for so long until your cart exhaust turns a different colour, or some other telltale sign.  Either way, you must powerslide for a few seconds to be able to boost out of it.

434d15b6f68ef2643756c532647ee71aaa	it's not all about notes correct, it's also about using star power, and note streak. if you improve on that, you'll get 5 stars sooner than expected.

You did not say what your state is..<br>  <br>  NOTICE: Game closing procedures will begin when all top prizes have been claimed. A scratch-off game may be sold even after all top prizes have been claimed. For more current information on prizes claimed in a scratch-off game, call 1-800-37-LOTTO. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.txlottery.org/export/sites/default/Games/Scratch_Offs/details.html_252734209.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.txlottery.org/export/sites/de...</a>|`|AA11349925	If any of us knew do you think we'd be here answering this or sunning ourselves on a private yacht in the Caribbean?|`|iT31pFLqaa	those things are a crock, in fact don't gamble at all. the house always wins just look at vegas.........|`|I5SypMlsaa	you dont, just keep scratching for fun|`|zUduWsPfaa	The best techiques to win a scratch ticket is to play a set of cards/tickets in the same booklet successively. There are more chances there than going from one type of booklet to another. It's like in the slot machines in the casino. They are so programmed that there is a frequency or intervals of winning cards, Another technique is to get the next card after you win one because more often people stop there. But again with experience the next card may be the bigger one or the lesser amount. One thing I am very sure is to read the letter codes (3 letters scattered around the scratched area) I know how much I won if I see the letters, except perhaps the biggest one or rare amounts.|`|AA12395964	buy a lot of them and get lucky. if you lose by more. you have to win eventually. but you might spend more money than you win. so technically you might call that a loss. but then you can use that money to buy more and probably win.|`|QwiGDmqAaa	theres no special way to win other then actually scratching lol. scratch the code only if you dont wanna play the actual game. other then that theres nothing that you can do|`|dbBbPnbraa	Scratch the tickets then read the rules and see if you won|`|L8yKZ1TRaa	Luck. Or try a ini-mini-miny-mo.|`|29f9384a4b337057b6cdde94e49404c0aa	You're kidding right?

nBUDjyhgaa	I would go with the Afrikabraun, with a few drops of yellow to lighten <br>  it.Your final color should be a Yellow-tan,not quite brown, but close.I <br>  would also dry brush white to hilight raised detail.Best of luck.
g7gdB2JAaa	No one will buy old common cards, the fastest way to sell them all is to sell them in lots of like 20 to 100, on ebay. Put some of the rare cards in some of the lots so people will buy them for sure. I've done it on many times, sell a card lot of 50 cards with 2-4 or so holograms granted in the lots and people will buy them more often. The really rare cards like a Charizard sell those by themselves at a fair amount you think works, check what other people are selling them for and match their prices or make it better.|`|K8tucvCwaa	i don't think they are worth anything, but you may have some rare ones, check out ebay, and see how much the rare ones goes for.|`|CYwvuqclaa	open promo cards go from a dollar to ten dollars on ebay depending on the card unopened cards go for around 5-15 dollars. I'd need more information on the type of the other cards i.e shadowless/base set/jungle/fossil to determine their value. Probably easiest to go to ebay and look around.
f5f4879a8f8160c19eb69d40a846ad2baa	Gamestop doesn't take original Xbox anymore.<br>  It hardly seems worth it to sell it for a few bucks on ebay.<br>  <br>  You're better off hanging onto it, or giving it to a friend or family member.<br>  <br>  Make sure you hang on to the games you can play on the 360 tho!|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	At a place like gamestop or the like? Probably ten or fifteen bucks. They sell it for about $50, so they're not going to offer much.<br>  <br>  It's a shame too, if you know how to do it, those things are one of the most effective media centers you can buy in most countries, you'd spend between $500-$1,000 trying to get the same features from other electronics, and it wouldn't work as well.|`|G5WCJonxaa	well it all depends on where u trade it in at and if it is still working. I cant really tell you a price but u should just go to gamestop or some other game store. DONT go to wal mart its a waste of time|`|iqJWCfQIaa	The trade-in value @ GameStop is around 30$. Instead of trying to trade it in at GameStop, post an ad on CraigsList or try selling to a pawn shop.|`|fKco44yxaa	￡5.....<br>  <br>  Like nothing....<br>  <br>  Try Ebay (might get 20ish there)

ivzhA4Bdaa	I lived in Las Vegas for quite a few years.  Dealing is not at all glamorous, or it wasn't back then.  Dealers had to deal with drunken, unhappy, losing gamblers all the time.  The dealers I knew didn't particularly enjoy dealing, it was like working as a cashier in other places, only with more abusive customers.  It was just a job to put food on the table.  It's certainly nothing to aspire to.<br>  <br>  This was 20 years ago, and some things might have changed.  However, dealers are standing on their feet for their entire shift.  They aren't allowed to sit down.  This causes back and leg and circulatory problems (hemorrhoids, varicose veins, bad back, etc.).  They had to put up with a very smoky workplace.  Even a non-smoking table will have a lot of smoke around it.  This MIGHT have changed over the years, but I rather doubt it.<br>  <br>  Most of the customers are decent people.  However, just one aggressive, abusive drunk can ruin your entire shift, and usually my friends averaged several nasty drunks in each shift.  Dealers MUST be able to take a lot of unwarranted abuse, all the time, and without being able to defend themselves.  The supervisors would allow quite a bit of abuse towards the dealer, too, as long as it didn't go too far and the gambler was spending money.  Can you take that?<br>  <br>  Dealers made a lot of money on tips, or as they called them, tokes.  Again, most people are decent about tipping when they win, but some either don't know or don't care that it's customary to tip the dealer.<br>  <br>  Back then, a dealer had to get a card from the Sheriff's office, and I imagine that something similar is still required.  One of the jobs I held was as a cashier in a convenience store, and because our store had slots in it, I had to get a sheriff's card too.  It wasn't much, I just had to fill out a form and let them take my fingerprints and agree to let them see if I had a criminal record, but some people regarded this as an invasion of privacy.<br>  <br>  You won't be able to work in the big, fancy casinos at first.  Instead, you'll have to work in the little shoddy casinos, where you won't make much money, unless you have some influence in a better casino.  Back in the 80s, it was called "juice", and probably it still is.  You will also, as the newest hire (IF you get hired) work the worst shifts.  And this means that you will not necessarily work all midnight shifts, either.  You might work a graveyard shift, midnight to 8 AM, be off for 8 hours, and then be expected to come in again for the swing shift, which is 4 PM to midnight.  Assuming that you live about 20 minutes from the casino, this meant that you had to grab a meal or two, grab a nap, shower and dress, and do any chores in the span of 7 hours.  This can be done on an occasional basis, but if you do it long term, then your health will suffer.<br>  <br>  Also, casinos didn't hire people off the street.  They would only hire people who had gone to dealing classes, and no, the casinos did NOT pay for these classes.<br>  <br>  Basically, people who dealt cards (or spun the roulette ball, or whatever) did not have exciting, glamorous jobs.  The people I knew didn't particularly enjoy it, it was just a way to make a little money without hard physical labor or a college degree.  Nor are the jobs particularly high paying.  EVERY dealer who worked for any amount of time started to hate the game they dealt, too, and often related games.  For instance, one of my best friends was a 21 dealer.  He used to love the game.  But after a few months of dealing it, he started to hate it.  The poker dealers were the same way.  After the initial thrill wears off, it becomes very boring and distasteful.<br>  <br>  You have to consider the current economy, too.  These days, people are getting their clothes and shoes repaired instead of buying new things.  Gambling is very, very much a discretionary spending item.  It's going to be one of the first things most people cut back on.|`|85AoQYh8aa	Man i would love to do that.  I would love to be a black jack or poker dealer they could pay me nickels and id still be happy.  I would say if you enjoy it which you prolly do o 4 it

I hope it helps.<br>  <br>  Tingle, Dark Link, and the Giant Turtle in Majora's Mask make appearances as Non-playable characters as well.  <br>  <br>  The object of the game is to knock opposing players off the battle field.  Depending on what mode of the game you choose, this will cause you to win the match, or get a point.  If you are playing for points, the player with the most points when time runs out wins, otherwise, the last man standing is the winner.<br>  <br>  Each character has four basic special moves, which can all be used by pressing "B" and then pushing the control stick in a certain direction.  Each of the characters has their own special moves, but Link and Young Link share the same moves.  <br>  <br>  The control stick will let you run around and jump (up and down, depends which direction you push), as well as help do certain moves. Z will grab people (and items when jumping through a platform), as well as throw/drop items (depending upon what you doing with control stick). A will do normal attacks and pick up items, and be will do special attacks. If you slam over and hit A at the same time you can charge up for a large Smash Attack by holding down, or release immediately. C-stick will let you do one quickly if you are in multiplayer, but in single player changes the camera. R and L will make a shield come up around you, making you only hit by grab attacks. If it breaks you will be stunned. X and Y let you jump. Every character can double jump, and most have an Up and B attack that lets them go once more. Every character has so many moves to master that to list them all would take several hours. The following is a list of the characters and a characteristic/move for each one.<br>  <br>  Super Smash Bros. Melee - Non-playable<br>  There are many non-playable characters in Super Smash Bros. Melee, though through usage of a Debug menu, these characters may become playable:<br>  <br>  Master Hand: Originally starring as the final boss of the original Super Smash Bros., Master Hand makes a return as the last enemy in Melee's classic mode and Event Match 50. Unlike other characters, Master Hand does not accumulate damage but rather has a set amount of HP, depending on where and at what difficulty the player fights him. Master Hand floats over the right-hand side of Final Destination. <br>  Crazy Hand: Crazy hand is the left-hand counterpart to Master Hand and is impulsively destructive. He is reached by reaching Master Hand and halving his HP within 15 minutes without using continues on Normal difficulty or higher. Crazy Hand floats over the left-hand side of Final Destination. <br>  Giga Bowser: Giga Bowser is a huge version of Bowser that can be reached in two ways: either by clearing Adventure Mode in less than 18 minutes without using continues on Normal difficulty or higher, or by unlocking and attempting Event Match 51. Though much larger than Bowser, Giga Bowser is not appreciably heavier or stronger (except in Adventure mode, when he, as well as the other ending Bowser, is given a handicap), but his attacks are much longer-ranged, some of his attacks have elemental side-effects and different knockback/damage qualities, and he cannot be grabbed. <br>  Fighting Wire Frames: Possibly descendants of the original Super Smash Bros.' Fighting Polygon Team, the Wire Frames are wire replicas of Captain Falcon (Male Wire Frames) and Zelda (Female Wire Frames) who lack special moves. They generally appear in Event Matches or Multi-man Melees under handicaps that greatly weaken them, although Cruel Melee reverses this situation, allowing the Wireframes to one-hit KO the player character with many attacks. <br>  Sandbag: a tall sandbag characterized by a pair of eyes. Player characters wallop on him in Home-Run Contest, racking damage and ultimately hitting him thousands of feet away with the Home-Run Bat (hence the name) or other attacks. Fortunately for him, Sandbag enjoys seeing other characters let loose on him - he doesn't seem to be injured by other characters' home-run endeavors.|`|ZOqmNZIyaa	you have to do adventure mode and beat classic|`|x6ZV68Bnaa	dude goto www.supermariosmashbrosmeele.com or search 4 it it lists all the characters and how to get them or email this question to nintendo.com

If you have all the expansions then the one you want is located at<br>  <br>  Program Files>EA Games>The Sims 2 Bon Voyage>CS Bin<br>  <br>  The reason you are getting all those notices is because Body Shop started the first time you clicked it and each time you clicked it you were starting another instance.  It doesn't like that.<br>  <br>  Make sure you don't have game or SimPe running when you start Body Shop and be patient.  The more downloads you have the longer it will take to start.  It takes about 15 minutes to start for me.<br>  <br>  If you want it to start faster and you're not planning on cloning any of your downloads, rename or move your downloads folder before starting Body Shop.

AA10847167	Aunque tu pregunta --supongo que por delicadeza de tu parte-- no es clara, entiendo que deseas que tu hombre dilate mas tiempo antes de eyacular.   Hay opciones para lograrlo.  Enterate y explicale de como ejercitar el esfinter (musculo cerca del escroto).   Puedes tambien ayudarle a practicar un ejercicio que consiste en llevarle hasta cerca de eyacular y entonces interrumpir el modo que sea que esten empleando, esperar un rato  en lo que la excitacion disminuye y volver a hacerlo.  Esto es necesario repetirlo y no se logra  en un dia.  Tambien puedes utilizar algun anestesico de uso externo para disminuir la sensibilidad del glande.  Existen varios y no es necesaria la receta de medicos.  Prueba con algun unguuento a  base de nupercaiina, pues no disminuye la capacidad de la ereccion pero como desensibiliza hasta cierto punto, tu pareja podra estar mas tiempo en el coito contigo sin llegar a la eyaculacion antes de que tu tengas tu(s) orgasmo(s).  Una de las maneras de ejercitar el esfinter para desarrollar control y poder dilatar la eyaculacion consiste en cortar o interrumpir el acto de descargar la vejiga (orinar) repetidamente sin la ayuda de las manos.  Es probablemente el mejor ejercicio al alcance de todo hombre.    Espero que lo dicho les ayude.  Suerte, Adian.|`|mlYqgunXaa	Ja, ja tu pregunta suena tan ambigua, ?Aguantar qué? ?Números?

rSt1GqWUaa	Sicuramente hai visto il filmato iniziale del bellissimo FF7, ma da quanto ne so la SquareEnix non ha intenzione di fare nessun remake. Quello era per far vedere le prestazioni grafiche della PS3. Hanno fatto la stessa cosa per la PS2 ma col filmato del ballo fra Rinoa e Squall di FF8 ^_^<br>  Da parte mia però non mi piacerebbe un remake, dopo porcate (scusate se offendo qualche fan accanito) del tipo FFadvent children o i vari Crisis Core, Dirge of Cerberus e Last Order non vorrei che si rovinasse una perla dei giochi di ruolo.|`|jrAiHjILaa	il filmato di FF7 è stato creato x dimostrare le enormi potenzialita grafiche che puo sviluppare la ps3.. in questi giorni però gli sviluppatori del gioco starebbero pensando di accogliere le nostre richieste e quindi rendere il video un gioco vero e proprio, ma senza xro prima aver finito giochi in via di sviluppo come the last remnant e kingdom hearts 3!!!<br>  sinceramente non vedo l'ora che esca, secondo me sara il final fantasy definitivo!!!!!!!!

PR0vWC0Qaa	What Michael W said.. build a crafting bench.. or.. you could use the one at the 1st island-First Beach.. It's 2 rocks, when you go up to it, it'd say something about using driftwood.. just put the drift wood there and it's a make-shift crafting bench.<br>  <br>  Just for your information. you can build items and instead of deleting them, choose to put them in your inventory to save your resources instead of having to build them all over again..|`|PxhzjeMlaa	To get the sewing kit you have to make it, to make it you have to go to a crafting bench.
