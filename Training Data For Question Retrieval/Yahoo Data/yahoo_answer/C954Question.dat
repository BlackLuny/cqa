20090130151853AAjPZJQ	Business & Finance;Insurance	What constitutes 'liability' in an auto collision claim?	I was in an accident last Friday in which I crashed in to a red-light-runner. I was Northbound in the far right lane. There was a vehicle beside me in the left lane and just ahead of me. The other driver ran the red light headed West. The driver beside me in the left lane caught most of the impact. The roads were wet, it had been raining. I stepped on my brakes and ended up in the right inside corner of the 'T' that the two other cars made. As soon as we all made it out of our vehicles, the red-light-runner immediately admitted fault. The police showed up and took their report. 1 witness statement was taken. The red-light-runner was cited, and no one else. All of our vehicles had to be towed. Since then, I have been in contact with the other drivers insurance company and my own. I thought that this would be an open and shut case because of the obvious fault of the red-light-runner, however, his insurance company is giving me the run-around. They do not want to authorize a rental car for me, and although they had my car taken from the tow yard to the body shop (and sent in an appraiser) the claims adjuster told me today that they are "NOT EVEN SURE THEY ARE GOING TO PAY MY CLAIM" because of "CONFLICTING" recounts of what happened during the accident. WTH!? Please, somebody, correct me if I am wrong, but doesn't the fact that this man ran a red light make him/his insurance company liable? She says that they are still conducting their "investigation" and that the "whole thing is a mess". This is some division of Century insurance. They have given me no indication of when they will be done with this investigation, and how they are going to "investigate". They did tell me that they have been unable to get in contact with their insured because they have incorrect contact info for him- so they haven't been able to get his statement. Claims rep has also stated several times that they "only have $10,000 to work with". HELP! I cannot afford to pay for a rental car for the 15+ days that my car will be in the shop! How do I deal with these people and what are my rights? But mostly, what constitutes "liability" and how does an insurance company make these types of decisions?

My father WILL NOT be claiming me as a dependent this year.   I do not live at home, I am a full time student at an accredited college in my sophomore year.   When school is out, I live with family.   I held two jobs last year.   My student loans are in my name alone.   I provide 100% of my own support and pay for school/car/phone on my own.      So, I ran through turbo-tax deluxe two scenarios.  One in which I said "I can be claimed as a dependent, but I will not actually be claimed."  The other, I said "I cannot be claimed as a dependent."   My refunds in these two scenarios differed by $600 - the better of the two being with box 6a checked, or "I cannot be claimed as a dependent."      Can I do this? I feel that legally I meet the guidelines of providing my own support.  Please advise.      Also, I ask for possible citations.  I'd like a confirmed answer.  Thanks.

20090130165912AAhAolH	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	I Need Help filing out California unemployment claim for the week!?	Hello! I am filling out my first unemployment claim and, as it is nearly impossible to reach the California office by phone, I am hoping someone here may have a reputable answers to my two questions. They both regard question 6b.      1. I am a writer/editor and while I'm looking for another full-time position, I am taking freelance writing assignments. I need to let the EDD know about these. However, they only give space for one employer per week. What do I do if I work for multiple employers (multiple magazines, sites, etc.) in one week?      2. What do I put in for "date last worked" and "total hours worked" since each article takes a few days (at least to write)? Do I put the date I completed and turned in the piece and how many hours it took me? I'm fine with doing this, but I don't know how I feel about them reaching out to the places I'm writing for and them saying, "so, we need to confirm that this writer took 5 hours writing this piece for you."      If you are knowledgeable about this, I would appreciate some guidance. Thank you.

The rent paid is all utilities included, everything, electric, gas, a/c you name it all included.  He leaves the lights on all the time when he is not home.  I have told him to turn off the lights when he is not home.  By this, meaning for hours every time he is not home.  I understand going out and leaving one light on when you return home, but it is the lights, the ceiling fan, the TV.      The rent is due any day now, or whenever he feels like paying it, I was thinking of increasing the rent.  Good idea or not?      How much electric does it waste to leave everything on?      Thanks.

Tax year 2007 my mom claimed me as a dependent, and I know she shouldn't have. I filed my taxes properly, but since she filed hers before mine, she got the credit for using me as a dependent. To give you some background... I am 20 years old. I lived with my mom until middle of April 2007. I moved out and was supporting myself completely with a full time job paying all my own bills. I was NOT a student. December 12th 2007 I moved back in with my mom, payed her rent, payed all my own bills, and bought my own food.

This change made a huge difference in the refund amount I was supposed to be getting. Is there anthing that I can do now in order to receive the full refund that I should have a year ago?

I recently applied for a Discover card that I was supposedly "pre-approved" for, but ending up getting declined anyway. The reason they gave me was that I have a charge-off on my credit report. I looked up what this means, and found that it's a payment that has been deliquent for over 3 months. This can't be right, because I only have 1 other credit card and I've never missed a payment, in fact it's not even maxed. The only other thing to ever be in my name were some utilities, which were always paid. The only thing I could think of was that my student loans might have trigged this, because I'm still in school and haven't started payments yet. That being said, I'm not required to start payments on them until I graduate. Could they still have triggered the charge-off or was there a mistake somewhere? Thanks.      -Matt

But Google Ads will only let you display up to 3 of their Ads on a page at a time. However, when I visit some other websites, I notice that they have the usual 3 other Google Ads, plus many others.      So my question is, do any of you know any good sites that are similar to Google Ads, so that I am able to add more advertisements on my site? I am looking for something that is more vertical than horizontal, something like 300x100 or the like. Thanks in advance.

20090130204023AAoGi8a	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Is it wrong that Liberty Tax Service withheld or deducted the stimulus rebate, received from 2008...?	What I mean is, my friend went to a tax service called Liberty Tax Service and they told him, that they were told by the IRS to deduct the stimulus rebate that he had received and to show it as an earned income, when figuring his taxes. Something does not sound right. Could someone who works in taxes please explain and/or could anyone else please give or provide there experiences related to there taxes and the stimulus they've received? How can the government want the stimulus money back, since they gave it to those to stimulate the economy? Do you think that Liberty Tax Service is up to no good?
