IuCT3TjGaa	This problem can mean many things, odds are the problem is with the operating system itself. I'm going to give you some instruction of some things I would do if I was working on this computer.   Questions you should consider:   Do you get any error messages? If so contact Microsoft with the error message.   Is you computer under warranty? If so, it's best to let a technician handle the problem. Note: Sometimes they will reformat or replace your hard drive. You could loose all data so it would be a good idea to backup first.   Re-pare Steps:   1) Restart Windows in Safe Mode. As you computer is restarting, hold down F8 and once the menu appears, select Safe Mode using the arrow key and selecting by pressing enter. Note: If windows does not boot in safe mode then seek help from a train technician, the problem may be too complex to go into decision in the message.   2) Consider a system restore. You will loose all data and changes you have made to your computer after the restore date. Open system restore by clicking on the start menu and selecting help and support. System restore should be one of the options assuming you have system restore turned on. (It's windows default so you should.) Select a restore date prior to the problem occurrence. Restore your PC. If you do not want to do a system restore then skip this step.   3) Update any and all ad-ware, spy-ware, and most importantly, Registry Cleaner programs that are running on you computer.   Use the tool:   http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... [if you do not have one]    http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]    4) Run a virus scan, then spy-ware scan, followed by ad-ware.   5) Your problem should be resolved by now. Restart your computer and see if it works, if not then restart in safe mode again (step 1).   6) If all else fells you can reformat your hard drive by reinstalling windows. You can do this by inserting the windows disk or system restore disk that came with your computer. Follow the instructions given by the manufacturer. WARNING: This will wipe the hard drive of all data, it will be like you just got your computer. You will loose all software and everything.   I hope this helped.

In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|uuDloQnCaa	Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.

It's less common than with Windows though.|`|nqbcJjHyaa	Limewire itself does not give viruses. The files you share are what contain the viruses. There are over 1,000,000 Windows viruses, there are no released MacOs X viruses. So any viruses you get in a file would only affect Windows computers. You could by accident pass those viruses on to Windows users. There are 6 Mac trojans, they do not replicate, they do not harm a Mac unless you download them, agree to install them and use your admin password to activate them. There's a fake Mac poker game, a fake Mac anti-virus, a fake Mac malware remover, a fake Mac porn viewer. There's Mac trojans attached to illegal torrents of iWorks 09 and Photoshop CS4. So unless you have one of those and install it, you are fine.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|TpJbtJCfaa	How bout the Dell Inspiron mini 9?

Vt0xnuWpaa	Yes. If you're a casual gamer, then it might be the right laptop for you - costing just about $1,000. Try to look for special offers for a better deal online.    However, do consider that the optimum setup is at least 2.4GHz Processor, 4 GB RAM, and the upgrade to the GeForce 8600M GT card. This setup will be able to run pretty much all the games out to date, however some of the newer ones will need to be run in lower resolution and quality. Don't settle for the 8400M; you won't be satisfied.     XPS is Dell's highest tier line right under Alienware. Their support website is one of the best on the web when it comes to major PC manufacturers.    GeForce 8600M GT Profile  http://www.notebookcheck.net/NVIDIA-GeFo...    --    Geeeyaaa really doesn't know what he's talking about. If he took a moment to look at the figures, he will notice that MSI GX610 can barely handle Crysis at low settings (averaging a measly 20FPS) and cannot even hope to try medium settings. He would also realize that the XPS M1530 has the option of equipping the 8600M GT which is a much better Class 2 Card than the Mobility HD 2600.    --    If you do not meet those requirements, you won't have a very enjoyable experience. As the others have expressed, it depends on your configuration. The 8400M will not be able to run games as well as the 8600M GT option, which is a very decent 2nd Class card.    Do note that the 8600M GT can run games pretty well, but sometimes you will need to turn down settings. For example, modern games like Crysis and Assassin's Creed will force you to play at a lower resolution and graphic detail. However, the 8600M GT should easily run older games like WoW, Source/HL2 Engines, Left4Dead (on medium).    After having a look at the requirements for NFS:U, I can pretty certainly say that the XPS M1530 will easily be able to handle the graphic demands.    --    If you plan on spending around $1,300 customizing the XPS M1530 without any warranty, consider getting the Gateway P-FX series laptop. It's a huge bang for the buck considering hardware and price. http://www.gateway.com/systems/series/52...    If you're not looking specifically for a Dell, there are many other very capable laptops with good graphics cards for around the same price made by Acer, Asus, MSI, and others. Check out online retailers like http://www.newegg.com and http://www.tigerdirect.com to see what kind of laptops there are. You might also want to check the websites of local retailers like BestBuy/Walmart/Fry's for any deals on similar laptops.    Also, if you plan on doing some serious gaming, you might take Prime Evil's advice on building a desktop. Desktops are cheaper, last longer, more upgradeable, and generally cheaper for the same setup. True gaming laptops are heavy, break more easily, and do not last long very on battery power.|`|3FXJtjq6aa	your not rly giving us enough feed back.. What kinda GFX card, what operating system, how much ram, and what processor is in it.. Are some pretty good details you could give us.|`|YNoTqr0uaa	you want to play older games, it's fine! Will it run crysis smoothly, um no. Keep in mind you will not be able to upgrade the GPU in a laptop either.      If you are a huge gamer, always go with a desktop.|`|FONse7Ijaa	Overall it is a decent laptop and should play most games smoothly, however it depends on the spec's.

nV3CTelWaa	Blogs are personal, online equivalents of a journal, diary, bulletin board, column or forum. A contraction of the term "web log," a blog is a web-based running commentary. It usually has a single entry, on which readers can comment. People blog about politics, technology, sports, media and religion. Learn how to join the world of bloggers by creating one of your own.    Step1    Get started by choosing a site that hosts blogs, often free of charge. Blogger.com, Typepad and LiveJournal are just a few places to get acquainted with.     Step2    Buy blogging software if you'd like a more involved blog, or would like to learn more. The software isn't necessary to get your blog started, but it can be an added element down the line.     Step3    Consider registering a domain name that redirects others to the URL of your blog page. You may get more visitors this way.     Step4    Start writing. A blog can be a great way to share your opinions and tell stories. The more frequently you write, the more visitors you'll tend to receive. Some bloggers try to write daily if possible  .   Step5    Remember that a blog is made public. Never share anything that is too personal or you risk having regrets.     Step6    Add graphics, animation, polls and other features as you become more acquainted with the world of blogging.       www.blogger.com/         http://www.bloggingtips.com/2007/11/29/b...      www.blogtopsites.com/|`|lw8n5BFeaa	I would go to wordpress, It's fun and easy.

Ev6WQRmzaa	The 64bit one is the only one that will be able to actually address all 4GB of RAM|`|j3Px4JXfaa	Hi kugarweb05@btinternet.com,    My names Ron. Im a member of the Windows Outreach Team and thought Id just stop by to drop a couple links in here that might help you understand the 64-bit computing a bit better.    Like some people have brought up, with 4GB of DDR2 you can definitely take full advantage of the 64-bit version of Vista, especially if youre planning on expanding on that 4GB anytime in the future.     Here are a couple links that will explain everything in pretty simple terms (from Microsoft):     First, here are the general system requirements for Vista: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...    This second link takes you to a page where you can compare the different versions and it tells you a little more about the 64-bit version: http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...    Also, just as a note, it was mentioned that you might just wait until Windows 7 is released; I wouldnt advise that you do that. Windows 7 is in the Beta stage right now and has no definite release date set as of now.     If you still have some questions, feel free to reach out. Id be glad to help anywhere I can.    Cheers,  Ron  Windows Outreach Team|`|JQGvqXASaa	Go with the 64-bit version as you ahve 4GB and assuming you have more space, it'll work even better.|`|Z0EWleKraa	64 bit.|`|M0HTIeutaa	64 bit version.

If you don't have any 64-bit applications, then go with the 32-bit version.    The "A 64-bit OS can use all 4gb" is a red herring argument because 32 bit applications won't use more than 2gb anyway.  The downside of a 64-bit OS is that there may be that you have some hardware items that don't have driver support for a 64-bit system, which will make them unusable. That would be the determining factor for me.    You certainly need to run the Vista Upgrade Advisor to see what problems you may be facing.|`|dn825Y13aa	if you go above 4gb of ram you will need the 64bit version. most apps that you install on the 64bit version will run under the 32bit (x86) emulator. I have the 64bit and I am very happy. if you use it to connect to a work VPN then you will need to look into an alternative to cisco VPN, such as the NCP secure client.

m0fU0H7jaa	Seeding is the most fundamental part of torrenting. When you download a file from a tracker, you are acquiring it from all of the "seeders" that are giving the file back at that time.    If you are used to person to person filesharing such as limewire, then you would know this as uploading.  However, when you seed a torrent file, you are pointing the tracker to the specific location on your computer in which to throw back to the tracker, and forward to the leechers (those downloading the torrent - the antonym of "seeder"). Unlike person to person, these torrent files are split up into hundreds of individual "pieces", and when you seed a file, you are transferring random amounts of small pieces of the file that you give out, and when the leecher receives all pieces, the file is put together and they have received a perfect digital copy. Think of it like...willy wonka's particle machine.    Hence, the file is acquired by the "leecher" by many different sources (different seeders) at the same time rather than one person at a time (p2p)    Currently, you are sharing 20 torrent files that others are able to download off of you [if you have your connections correct]        So to answer your question, YES, seeding will slow your connection speed because it is obviously using up more bandwidth and maxing out your transfer speeds.    You can set a maximum upload cap on your seeding files if you start to see a decrease in your download speeds.    However, remember to always seed your files, because that's the way the torrent world works. Without seeders, there are no leechers. Don't be a hit-n-runner, pls. share the love.|`|WUZai7K6aa	when you "seed" a torrent you are sharing with other people so they can download the torrent. It is only fair to seed something for awhile after you're done downloading so other people can get what you have already downloaded. It shouldn't slow down your connection speed too much...

Elobl7qdaa	A graphical user interface is a type of user interface which allows people to interact with electronic devices such as computers; hand-held devices such as MP3 Players, Portable Media Players or Gaming devices; household appliances and office equipment. A GUI offers graphical icons, and visual indicators, as opposed to text-based interfaces, typed command labels or text navigation to fully represent the information and actions available to a user. The actions are usually performed through direct manipulation of the graphical elements.    The term GUI is historically restricted to the scope of two-dimensional display screens with display resolutions capable of describing generic information, in the tradition of the computer science research at Palo Alto Research Center (PARC). The term GUI earlier might have been applicable to other high-resolution types of interfaces that are non-generic, such as videogames, or not restricted to flat screens, like volumetric displays.

gjMJzfoeaa	No they typically do not have an individual label. Various products of the same brand for example will have different UPCs or store codes, but all HP Pavilion DV1234 will have the same UPC, but will be different from HP Pavilion DV 5678.     One of the main reasons for the UPC/bar code is for the store to inventory what products are sold. This way reordering for items takes less time.     The only instance I can think of where the bar codes might be different would be states with bottle deposits versus states without bottle deposits. For example if I purchased a case of Pepsi in Ohio (non bottle deposit state) I cannot return the bottle at a Michigan store to get the $0.10 refund.|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	A UPC code is assigned to every mfg'r who applies for one, and is tied in with the Fed. Tax ID, & some other stuff.  The first series of digits represents the ID of that mfg'r, and the last 4 or 5 represent the individual product line, not a single item.  Useful for inventory, or in some cases, product recall, because the mfg'r keeps track of the production of the product items (dates, ingredients, sub-contractors, etc.), making re-call somewhat less painful.  P.S.; bottle deposits can be made across state lines; I do it in Wisconsin > Michigan.|`|YVE64dJUaa	this scam is called the white house scam as a white house official was caught doing this very scam    it is why most stores will put a sold sticker on sold items or put them in sealable bags with a sold sticker on them    but for every time a store comes up with ways of preventing theft criminals work out ways around it and always will, such is life|`|M0HTIeutaa	If its the same item it has the same whats called UPC. The barcode is the same for each item that is the same.     so a box of brown cinnamon pop tarts has the same UPC as another box of brown cinnamon pop tarts but a box of brown cinnamon pop tarts has a different UPC than that of a Strawberry box of pop tarts    see what I'm saying?    so that guy bought brown cinammon pop tarts, his friend put another box close to the exit, then the guy went back in and got it but walking out instead of getting busted for stealing they see brown cinnamon pop tarts on his receipt and let him go

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|jwurmVbVaa	try the dell studio models     http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...    or maybe a Asus  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...
bed556c412329f084e39442c54231151aa	If you are building a high end gaming machine, you will need to get the obvious graphics and sound cards etc, but do not forget to get yourself a UPS for battery backup, and a very good surge protection device to protect the whole package.  When looking for surge protection, look for a product which has a replacement warranty, as well as a connected equipment warranty (without a connected equipment warranty- it doesn't have to protect anything).  Steer clear of the likes of Belkin and Monster, and go for more specialised product.|`|5zSSGKBpaa	Here is the best of the best.  Good luck

GuTWbZn4aa	Netbooks to date are designed to do little more than write e-mails, do word processing, and do a little web surfing (streaming HD video is tough). On the plus side they are ultra portable. If you can wait until March or April, I would hold out and get one of the new machines that ASUS is going to be putting out (Eee 1000HE or T91 or T101). These machines will have more power and will have more features. As far as Linux is concerned, Easy Peasy is the best OS for these machines. Windows can be more memory intensive and can be harder on the battery. When Windows 7 comes out it might be a different story, but Linux packs the most features for a smaller "footprint". Hope this helps and good luck in your decision.    Also: NewEgg.com (or even Amazon.com at times) might offer a better deal.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	The Eee PCs are pretty good, but the version of Linux they come with is terrible.

And, yes, you can write papers on it.|`|5P0yQm6Qaa	ASUS is a great company.... never heard anything about their Laptops but there other PC products are great.

It just has a smaller keyboard. The available colors that I know they have are black and white. If you look at other places rather than Target, you can find more brands and varieties with more storage space. There's also a Windows XP version of netbooks. You'd get more for your money this way. The Asus Eee Pc is not the only netbook on the market.

hgPCZ3UUaa	Well, in my opinion the answer would be a mighty NO!    Ok, so you can download music, but even if you pay for subscription,its not really legal.     Limewire, infact most P2P software is plagued with spyware/malware, which in turn will mess your system up incredibly. There is an older version of Limewire which contains no spyware.However, its the systems you download music from which will have the major sorce of Virus' and spyware to help mess up your system and time.    When you download a track from limewire,you do so by downloading it off someone elses PC, in turn they could be infected,passing on the infection to you. Also,with it being P2P, they will have access to your system and all of the music that you have, not very safe hey!    If you want to download music, i would suggest doing it off a legit music site, like itunes or HMV for example, this way your getting music pretty cheap and staying safe in the process. There are even some sights that for a small sum,let you download as many songs as you want over 28days.    My advice is keep it safe,even if its an old PC you dont really care about. Piracy laws have really been clamped down,and you never know, the officers could come knocking on your door.|`|079130329272342dd420898082096aeaaa	Limewire is not illegal. Downloading songs is illegal but you wont go to jail. You can just get sued.    The only way you get caught is if  the RIAA is the one who is hosting your song download to catch you in the act.     Right now RIAA has gone away from lawsuits because the record companies dont have money to keep the RIAA legal fund afloat.   The RIAA is currently trying to make deals with ISPs to have them cut you off.    Limewire the program itself wont put spyware or viruses on your computer but the stuff you download could.  Theres ways to mask a computer virus to look like your downloading a song.    Yes you'll find anything and everything on it. If you don't put a search term in the box to find it you wont see it.|`|ZPOOV8uvaa	well lime wire has been found to give you a pc virus, happened to me but it takes a while.|`|7kKlaF5Laa	no its not but if you download a song or something who ever put it on that can look at your computers files  get frostwire its like limewire but limewire you have to pay for limewire pro and frostwire is like limewire pro|`|R1NHUuyzaa	1- yes, it's illegal; and there are hefty fines if you are caught, although millions of people use it and are rarely caught    2- it very well may be carrying malware    3- there is some bad material, but usually it's only found if you search for it.

But, certain motherboards are picky as to the type of memory they use. So there are absolutely no guarantees that it will work.    If the memory is on their qualified vendors list, then it will probably be ok.

It is recommended that you upload wmv file format... good quality and smaller size.. so faster upload... and also faster processing.    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is wmv file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..      --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.

No    When i clicked it twice it said it may install antivirus or anti spyware to ur computer. So does it mean i have to uninstall the anti virus software ?  You have to install it for free scan, but once you install it, you have to buy it to remove the virus.     does it do its job or it breakes the computer ?  Whether it works depends on its database.  If it's large enough, it will work.  If not, it can't delete the virus.

Once you've done that, get some real security.    Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups.

Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.

zorYTX59aa	If you know of other vids using the same music, either YouTube will  take them down eventually, or someone who's jealous will flag them.  If you're willing to take the chance and re-upload your video with the   same music, do not write the name of the song or artist in your title,  description, or tags. Also avoid irrelevant phrases like "no copyright   infringement intended", "I do not own the music" or "I don't take any   credit for this song". The upload servers at YouTube actively search   for words and sentences like that. As well, it also reaffirms that you   have knowingly taken, used, copied or maybe even stolen someone   else's copyrighted material.    You should also consider the fact that the music-recording industry   is starting to use hidden "watermarks" or "fingerprints" buried within  their music, in order to uncover and identify their illicit use. As such,   it is possible that no matter how many times you try to upload your   video, it may always be rejected because of "copyright infringement".  You would thus be better off trying to find a different recording of the   music you want to use. If you've noticed that other videos are using   the exact same music, those videos were probably uploaded before   this new technology really started coming into being.    The only possible exception to everything that I've just written above   is for you to use music that is shorter than 30 seconds. If you listen   carefully to any talk-show on radio or TV, they will never use or play  other people's music for longer than 30 seconds when introducing a   guest or going into/out of commercials. Can you guess the reason?  (Hint: it has to do with "licensing fees" and "royalties".)    I hope my info has been helpful to you.|`|ajvSggX1aa	If it is from a cd or download it is copyrighted.

zorYTX59aa	If youre using Windows Movie Maker, there is  the possibility that you mistakenly saved your   video as an "MSWMM" file with "Save Project"  rather than save it as an "AVI" or "WMV" with   "Save Movie File" (Win XP) or "Publish Movie"   (Vista).    There is a world of difference between the first   example and the others: not only is MSWMM   considered a "work-in-progress", it is not even   a "true" video. The other 2 examples are what  you need to properly save your file and upload  it to YouTube.    The best way to save and upload your video is:    1 -- click the blue "Tasks" icon.....(you'll get the "Movie Tasks" menu)    2 -- click "Finish Movie", the 3rd option.....(it will expand to 5 choices)    3 -- click "Save to my Computer".....(the "Save Movie" wizard appears)    4 -- enter the name of your movie.....(it is best to stay in "My Videos")    5 -- click "Next" at the bottom.....(you'll see the "Movie Setting" page)    6a -- for regular video, click "Best quality for playback".....(the default)  6b -- for 16:9, click "Compress to" and tweak it until you see 640x360    7 -- click "Next" at the bottom.....(you will get the "Completing" page)    8 -- click "Finish" at the bottom.....(the saving may take quite a while)    9 -- click the blue "Tasks" icon again.....(you'll get the "Movie Tasks")    A -- click "Finish Movie" again, the 3rd option.....(you'll get 5 choices)    B -- this time, click "Send to the Web".....(I'm sure you know the rest)    YouTube suggests that the video format be  MPEG4 at 480x360 recorded together with   sound in MP3 audio, all at a rate of greater   than 24 frames per second. Other files that  are accepted include AVI, MPG, MOV and   WMV (which is Windows Movie Maker).

9Zxks6cBaa	Well than, another one of these. I haven't answered these to people on here before but I have to my family. You can't make one using Microsoft Word. You have to to use Microsoft Publisher. It comes with your PC if you go to Start then all programs then if you search you will find something that says Microsoft Office, NOT MICROSOFT WORKS!!! Then you will have a list of things that start with 'Microsoft'. You will see Microsoft Publisher if you scroll down. You should see a screen with a heading that says Getting Started with Microsoft Office Publisher 2007. Note: You may have an older version or younger such as 2006 or 2008. That does not effect the title though. Then you will see things with manila folders that have papers that say the things you can make with them. For example, one says Brochures. There is also a bar along the side that will say all the stuff in the manila folders and more. Just click on one and it will take you to a seen with sizes colors and more. It will also let you pick your layout or background. Then on the bottom right corner. It will take you to another screen that lets you customize and when you are done you click either save or print. Print is the sign with the printer and save is the little square disc. Also an easier way to save is to just click exit if your going to then it will say 'Do you want to save this?' or something like that. I hope I helped.|`|YxCRA5N7aa	to make a brochure you need   MICROSOFT PUBLISHER    i think that will help much better!

zc3BoaWgaa	First can you at all read the blue screen to determine what error message you are getting??  This would be key to further problem resolution...  Which specific registry file is getting the error?  Or are you getting a different type of BSOD error    There are numerous articles published on Google on how to disable this reboot so that you can see the error message.    Your personal folders such as (pictures, documents etc) should be okay as long as you do not reformat the hard-drive and as long as this error is not a hard-drive hardware error.    Worst case you would need to remove the hard-drive and either put in an external usb kit and attach to a second computer or attach as a second drive to a different computer.  This is a safety precaution to ensure that your critical files are safe.    Next depending on the registry file error or other BSOD error do a Google search to determine the appropriate recovery option.    Most likely you will have to reboot from the install disks and get into the recovery console to either run chkdsk or copy backup registry files into their proper location.    Then after reboot do a system restore to get the computer back to a current state.    There is much good documentation out on the web on this but all steps must be done in order and very carefully.    Post back if more assistance is required.      **************************************... info on stopping the auto reboot/restart    On some PCs that I've recently installed and/or worked on, in the boot options (press f8 before the windows logo and after it boots from the HDD), there is an option at the bottom of the list to disable the automatic reboot.    I don't know if it's a patch or a service pack edition as I've only had cause to take notice of it once, but I can tell you that it's on some, but not on others.

FTvkahKWaa	When the file cannot be converted or too small size, it means the file is in the wrong format...    Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|t5Mz1aLvaa	ok this happened to me all the time, but that was a long time ago...    1) you make the vid *done*  2) you save the vid correctly... *did you do this? if you do it right, then then a timer should come up saying how  long you have to wait... length of the timer depends on what you did in the video...*   3) upload to youtube...  4) wait til it uploads  5) enjoy the vid on youtube...

uuDloQnCaa	A lot of people are having problems with AVG 8 its a very poor AV switch to Avast which is also free, its lighter and provides far more protection.    Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.    What AVG does not do: http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...|`|FBQZ06vraa	AVG may not have told Windows that it was on the job.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|rMs4WBfcaa	www.radioshack.com check the compaq|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Pay more and get a lot more for your money. Here's why you should get a Mac:: There are NO CONS. The MacBook does both WinBloze and OSX, no other computer can make that statement. You have the best of the best. Apple Stores are popping up all over and you can make an appointment for a time and date, bring your computer there. They will troubleshoot it and fix it if it's a software problem it's FREE. What other computer company has stores and can make that statement? Get the 2.4 GHz with 4Gigs Ram and you got a speed machine like mine. The WinBloze people may not like a Mac computer but I'll bet they all have iPods. Go Mac and Never Go Back.|`|txBvcT2Raa	How about Netbooks? They're smaller and cheaper. Of course they can't run games and stuff but great for surfing and all that stuff girls do on the web.|`|GNpCY9Dnaa	Don't get a Mac. You won't find anything in the $500 range. Also, I'm always hearing that they are such an awful corporate company - they screw their customers over, the haven't given 10 cents to a chairity in 20 years, and they removed all of their handicap parking spaces at their offices. Not a good company give your money too.    When people say there are no cons - there always are. Mac's cost 3x as muchh as other computers; and NOBODY in corporate amercia uses Macs - only schools and Apple Computer.

There's a lot of risk you'd damage the screen, and you'd have a tough time putting it back together without introducing more dust. I don't recommend trying.

A router does not care what Operating System, what File System, or what Data Path is inside your computers. It all goes into the same types of Wi-Fi signals as soon as it leaves the PC (or Mac, for that matter). All can share the same router.    Where you may have difficulties, is if you use local network Shares. That can run into compatability issues, which are beyond my pay grade to resolve with you. Sorry.|`|6OFf4mKFaa	Absoluttely it will work. A router just assigns your computer an ip address that will be used to conect to the internet or your home network, regardless of the Operating System. I have 4 pc and I am running 1 Xp, 1 Vista and 2 Linux. They are all connected to the internet via router and can all conect to each other to share files.

HVQFVtelaa	Going out on a limb here, but surfing the other day I saw a "gizmo" for sale that was small and plugged into the front USB port. It had a funny name, I can't remember. It gives a computer Bluetooth compatibility, kind of like a modem, as a means of transporting data through radio waves. Yeah, I think it was advertised as a means for your computer to communicate with your phone to download ringtones or whatever. Anyway, pressure is so high to keep computer costs low that I doubt most computers have it internally. Try Parts Express .com and use their internal search for "bluetooth". They or someone will have it.   Good luck.   Magyver  P.S.

Eventually all small sellers will be driven away which is what eBay management appear to want. The site will be for large sellers only and buyers will then see prices as 'buy it now' only.

FBQZ06vraa	It's possible Webroot Spy Sweeper was installed at one time but the files were deleted rather than uninstalled.  This would have left traces in the Registry that McAfee may be detecting.    This is one of the few cases where I would actually suggest getting a registry cleaner to remove the traces -- and only those traces.  I don't trust registry cleaners for general purpose cleanup.  It's too easy for them  to be overly-aggressive and remove something that shouldn't be or to remove only part of something and cripple the rest.    Good luck.|`|pOrwteQUaa	It does this to me to some times to. You just have to uninstall one of your antivirals programs or turn one of the two off.

It is safe so long as she is conscious of the dangers and keeps the privacy settings so that only her friends can see her profile, photos, information etc.    The option to 'Add as Friend' or 'Send a Message' can be removed from the information that appears in a search for profiles, so no one can actually add her, and she can set it so that she won't appear in a search at all.|`|ofC4JQIhaa	YES are you kidding?! everyone has a facebook these days even my 9 year old cousin has one so go ahead and let her make one and im sure she will enjoy it|`|ANf5FzTXaa	Yeah, I think it's okay!

I've heard from some of the news , that facebook did sell some of the people's information , even if it's true or false , make sure she doesn't put any important info . And that's it .She'll be safe .|`|wt42Ppdaaa	Yes. My friend just had that problem. His parents were having the same question. As long as you set the privacy settings to Friends only, and be careful not to put your phone number or address, it's fine. It's a wonderful way to contact friends, and I love using it. Please let your daughter use it.|`|mwcaGj06aa	yeah as long as she sets her profile on private i think it would be okay i am 13 and i wish my parent's would let me have one but i think it would be better if she made one with your permission then without   i would let her i bet she would be happy.|`|UOGuAJ5iaa	Yes it is!

Likewise, if you visit http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows... you can review the system requirements for the different versions of Windows Vista.    Hope these helped a bit. Good luck.

These recommendations are specific to the Beta release and are subject to change.  1 GHz 32-bit or 64-bit processor  1 GB of system memory  16 GB of available disk space  Support for DirectX 9 graphics with 128 MB memory (to enable the Aero theme)  DVD-R/W Drive  Internet access  Note: Some product features of Windows 7, such as the ability to watch and record live TV or navigation through the use of "touch," may require advanced or additional hardware.   A few notes about Windows 7 Beta- The download cap is almost in place for Windows 7 Beta so if you want it you should download it within the next few days. Once August 1, 2009 comes around, the Beta will expire and you will need to reinstall your previous OS. Here is an FAQ page to check out if you are interested.  http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows...  Cheers,  Jeff  Windows Outreach Team|`|8aGeMalXaa	easily, i have windows 7 running on a computer with 256mb of ram, not very good on mine, but usable.    also, thats about the same speed as my laptop running vista, and windows 7 is supposed to run a lot faster, so you should be good|`|uYUGdcfzaa	XP would run well, Vista would struggle on 1GB it's happier on 2GB and Windows 7 ?? Who knows, but it is out in the public domain and you can download a beta version. Google it and see what the specs required are.  Remember you have to move with the times, and although I liked XP a lot I realised that it will not be supported for much longer and got Vista. Don't believe all that you hear about Vista, and remember that we used to think the planet was flat...

JSGJ8nV2aa	To start off, you need what is known as a "web host" - basically a company which will hold your website files for you, and display them online. I'd recommend one like http://www.dataflame.com    They will also be able to provide you with a service to purchase a domain name, like http://www.yourwebsite.com, and give you what is known as FTP access - this allows you to upload files to your webspace    The web host should be able to give you instructions on how to connect to FTP and add your files. There will most likely be a "public" directory, named something like "public_html" into which any files you upload will appear when you try your domain name live on the internet    e.g.    www.yourwebsite.com/hello.html    will display the contents of any file called hello.html uploaded into the public_html directory    (public_html could be called something else, like "home", or "www" or anything similar like that)    Robin  http://www.solarisedesign.co.uk|`|4d3Ie5lCaa	If what you are saying is " I know the code but I don't know how to get the code online", then here is your answer.    Buy a domain name and server at godaddy.    Download FileZilla: this will allow you to upload files to the server    Using the domain you bought, user name and password at godaddy, sign in to your server using FileZilla.    Filezilla consists of a window split into two parts, the left side is your computer files, the right side is your sever.    Go to a folder where you have a file saved as index.html on the left side of FileZilla, double click on that file to upload it to your server, the file index.html should appear on the right side or overwrite the current index.html file.     Now visit "yourdomain.com" and there it is! what ever content you had in your index.html file should now be on the internet. Good luck.|`|7igxiGrAaa	www.brinkster.com is also a great hosting site in addition to the ones above.|`|x6gWCjgyaa	freewebs.com  godaddy.com|`|2SQxX4oSaa	some of the hosting companies have videos and tutorials which explain it.

SozbX01Paa	Type your IP address into your browser search bar to access your hub. It should give you a list of items connected to the network. If you see an iregularatory, then you know something is wrong. My advice: Change your hub security. If you're using WEP, upgrade to WPA because it's safer and make sure you know who has a computer near you because chances are, it's them.     Hogging internet without permission is theft and therefore a crime. It can be reported if it gets worse and they continue to use it even after warnings. You need to do something because if the person downloads something illegally and your ISP (internet service provider) finds out, they will send YOU the warning letter.|`|uoajT3Wdaa	Always have your wireless protected!

zorYTX59aa	Unfortunately, YouTube doesn't let people  make their channel private, nor can others  be blocked from seeing it. However, if you   want, you can limit all the information that   is shown about you on your channel page   and in your description box.

jkG6tbseaa	It sounds fine to me. The RAM is plenty and 10.5.5 is nice (The newest). It depends on what you want to do with it (Nice to know). Tell me that and then I can tell you if it will work for you.    And as a little side note, Macs in my opinion are the easiest to use.

2SSA9e9Naa	Found this definition below. Basically, to me, the value of the collaboration diagram shows everything that is envolved in an interaction. Not just the sequence of events or interfaces, but all objects that are involved in the action    ------------------------------    UML Collaboration diagrams (interaction diagrams) illustrate the relationship and interaction between software objects. They require use cases, system operation contracts, and domain model to already exist. The collaboration diagram illustrates messages being sent between classes and objects (instances). A diagram is created for each system operation that relates to the current development cycle (iteration).     When creating collaboration diagrams, patterns are used to justify relationships. Patterns are best principles for assigning responsibilities to objects and are described further in the section on patterns. There are two main types of patterns used for assigning responsibilities which are evaluative patterns and driving patterns.     Each system operation initiates a collaboration diagram. Therefore, there is a collaboration diagram for every system operation. An example diagram for purchasing a bus ticket.

There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|i1T8yKhpaa	DELL   DELL  DELL  DELL  DELL  DELL|`|gCvMS2KEaa	apple; mac book  i loveee mine  :D|`|XlyLakYAaa	It depends on what you want.

All can be trusted and download one to clean your registry..|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	To keep a Windows system running at peak efficiency, registry cleaning is one procedure to do using "CCleaner": http://www.ccleaner.com/  Freeware.    Download; create a 'Restore Point;  install CCleaner; then:  On the main CC window, the 'paintbrush' tab is for the Windows components that you can clean; tick the bottom right box (Run Cleaner) an it will delete (or overwrite option) those files.  Same for 'applications' tab.  Next, down from the' paintbrush' is the 'Registry' icon (like a Rubik's Cube); first tick 'Scan for issues' button on the bottom; wait for the process to run.  it'll show a long list of entries for the first couple of cleanings; (Back up your first couple of registry cleanings, and if your unit gets ungovernable, restore those files. I've never had to do it, so I can't tell you how. After that the cleanings will be for empty folders or other junk so backup likely won't be necessary).  When ready, tick the 'Fix Selected entries' and CC will take care of those.  For your 1st few uses,  have checked the 'show prompt to back up registry files'; open CC> Options> Advanced> check the 'show prompt...' box; then tick the 'yes' or confirm to back up the registry.  (It gets saved to the 'c' drive, as 'ccxxxxxx')    Also, it's handy to put a shortcut to CC in your recycle bin folder so you don't have to open the app. every time.  CC> Options> Settings> tick the 'Add Run CC Option to Recycle bin'  And, if you use your browsing history a lot, you may want to un-check that box on the 'Cleaner> Internet Explorer' > History box; (otherwise, it clears your history file).|`|m0a7Ox1maa	defrag your drives|`|CqUcBJfRaa	http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/artic...

3w1NPZlzaa	The problem is that learning ActionScript requires learning a lot of other programming concepts. Usually these concepts (OOP concepts) are taught with more meat and potatos languages like Java and C .     But don't be discouraged because if you are willing to learn than you can do this no problem. If you don't know Flash pick up Flash Professional 8 by H.O.T at lynda.com. ISBN 0-321-29388-6. Okay, and the next thing you need to do is just pick up an ActionScript book. Just go to your local book store and look in the computer section. Look for the book with the most code and fewest pictures. If you buy one book it'll be about $50 and if you buy two it'll be about $100. That might seem like a lot but it's well worth it.    You may come into problems where you don't understand the terminology. Just read up on OOP (try Java, it's not hard) and then come back to ActionScript once you get it down. If you actually work at this you can be making websites in a week and games in a few weeks.     Good luck!|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	How long?  That depends on how good a programmer you are already.  If you're not, figure on 6 months to learn programming first.  Then about 3-6 months to learn AS.  Then it's up to you how long it takes to become good at it.|`|HOk7NHAiaa	Most colleges don't teach Actionscript. But there are two type of people in this case :    The person with no programming experience, it will take this person over a month to understand the concepts and basic about Actionscript because they don't have any previous programming knowledge.    The person with programming experience this it will take this person less than a week to under how to program in Actionscript because they know how a program works.    To learn Actionscript you can just buy a book they are pretty cheap now or days it should cost you about 10 bucks or you can check out this website http://www.ahfx.com/ which has a basic tutorial and if you don't like to read just check out youtube they have tutorials there

SJM0rzHtaa	The Intel P45-chipset is an 8x Crossfire chipset.    When you have a single PCI Express graphics card installed on a P45 board, it will transfer data to the card at 16x speeds.  When you install two ATI cards on that board to Crossfire, it drops both cards down to 8x transfer speeds only.    If you want full 16x Crossfire capability, you want a board with either the X38 or X48 chipsets.    I heard of people running nVidia SLI on these Intel Crossfire chipset boards, but they have to use hacked drivers which are buggy, unstable and not supported.  YMMV.

While Microsoft hasnt announced any dates for release, they have announced the different versions that youll be able to purchase. While not a date, like everyone is asking for, this lets consumers know the process is moving forward.

rTTRsSLraa	Assuming you have Windows XP, 2GB of memory will run very smoothly. Hard drive capacity, and memory are two separate components of the computer. Hard drive space mainly concerns how much data you computer has on it, such as programs, and documents that you have. Usually hard drive capacities are large enough to store all of your data for quite a while, but if you are ever concerned go to 'My Computer' and right-click on the 'Local Disk' and select 'Properties' If the pie chart shows that you have more space used than more space available, you may want to consider buying a larger hard drive to hold all of your documents and programs.|`|vo42ZRPdaa	it will make windows run better|`|AA12182548	very good|`|FM7STaCWaa	its good enough for what your using it for.  you can right click right click your hard drive to find out how full it is, doubt it is tho. =]|`|2kdt25ijaa	The more RAM u got the fast the programs will run.

If you are running XP, then 2gb is great.    If you are running Vista, then 2gb is mediocre.      To understand how memory works, it is best to think of your computer like a car.    While you are driving the car, you put things that you want to be able to reach easily in your center console, or some other compartment close to the reach of the driver. Things like drinks, insurance information, maps etc.    This location is like the memory in your computer. You put the stuff there so it is easy to get to just as the computer stores data that it needs to get to quickly.    Things that you are not going to need right away, you put in your trunk, such as luggage, spare tires etc. That is like the hard drive in your computer.     It is stuff that you need to keep with you, but you don't need it right away. Just like in a computer, the hard drive (trunk) holds stuff until you need it.

m0fU0H7jaa	Welcome to the private torrent community, friend! I'm glad that you are concerned about your ratio.    You can definitely continue seeding your files, but you will have to manually change their target destination [where they pull the information from - the source].    You can find out how to do this easily with any popular client.    With Azureus you can right click and change the file location.  If you have uTorrent, you should just re-download the torrent file and point it to the new location [depending on the version], and same with transmission.    ***CAUTION***    IF YOU ALLOW ITUNES TO COPY / ORGANIZE YOUR LIBRARY:    It is dangerous to use these files as your seeding source. The reason for this is because iTunes can add ID3 tags to the actual files, especially if you change the song name, capitalize, correct the album name, etc. If you do this, the original ID3 tags that you are seeding will no longer match your source files, and your client will tell you that your file is corrupt.    For best results, copy your iTunes library - one copy to seed from, and the other copy is one that you have iTunes automatically copy and organize, from which your library is constructed. Therefore, your seeding files remain untouched.    Hope this helps!|`|2kdt25ijaa	Not if you set the original download location to the folder that you wanted.

After a few moments, the System Properties dialog box closes.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, as you already have a scanner, make sure its virus database is updated.    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings.

Running "flash" on a hosting package is not an issue.      Now, as for website design, personally unless you know flash very well or are willing to pay for a professional flash design I would leave it alone.  Flash is slow loading, resource intensive, and quite honestly just not very good from a "viewers" perspective.  You will find the majority of users loath flash websites.     If you're goal is to show a gallery of your artwork & you want to keep your costs low my suggestion would be to use a CMS and get yourself a decent template.   This would give you all the tools you would need business wise and a pretty easy administration back end.   I prefer to use Joomla CMS and it's quite easy to find templates at low cost.

Next, for each web hosting X, do a X sucks search on Google. Read some complaints and see if you may encounter the same problems like them. Some of the complaints may relate to certain groups of users only such as VPS, dedicated server users or resellers. So you may not be affected if you are not from these categories.       3. Eliminate those hostings you feel uncomfortable with, and look for the best bargain hosting for your money.    Fatcow, Justhost and Webfaction (you can even pay monthly with Webfaction) are some of the cheap good ones where you can host Flash files. Good luck.

It was the generation before us that invention the PC.  Don't use your age as an excuse not to learn something.       First of all you need to state which operating system you have.  If you have XP you can do a system restore and that should reset whatever was done to the computer.  If you have Vista you probably just have to right click on the icon of whatever program or action (such as "uninstall") and select "run as administrator."    All this can be found on Google.    Remember people can't really diagnose your computer without actually seeing it in person.    EDIT:  No need to be so snide mrhw21--If he/she has Vista, you need to run most programs as administrator whether or not you are one.|`|85a713567f6b7a60be0ef9d72bf0790daa	Ok, dont listen to the computer tech expert.........DONT DO THE RESTORE. You need to find out which account is the administrator and log onto that one. Once there open your control panel and user accounts or account settings. find your account and the buttons will tell you how to change yours back to an administrator account. Then your account should be able to administrate everything. Hopefully you have a guest account..........your computer will not allow itself to go without at least one administrator account.|`|AA10843948	There is a security hole in Windows XP (you didn't say which OS you are using - I hope it is XP).

I believe the key is F10 when you see the system logo comes up when you turn on your computer, you gotta be quick.. If you were smart and created another account aside from administrator, the first administrator would be hidden and shouldn't have a password. You could change your settings from there, let me know if you have more problems. Some computers still have the old glitches, even with the updates they send out.|`|GzJLIHvTaa	If you are and have been the only one who uses this, then you probably are the administrator "user".  However, with XP, you are not the actual administrator account 'namer'.  They have groups, administrator, power users, users. Thats for XP professional.  For XP home, its administrator and limited.  So, assuming you are an administrator in either OS, you still need to log on as the name administrator.  You probably never set a password, so while on the computer, go to start, shut down and choose the drop down arrow for Log off YourName.  Then when it comes back, for user type in administrator no password.  That should work,  Assuming the conditions already stated.
FXhBwQZ3aa	Assuming you are using Windows XP:    Make a duplicate of your Works shortcut and place it on the desktop.    In My computer or Windows Explorer, drill down to the following directory (folder):  C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Programs\Startup    Drag the duplicate Works shortcut in to the Startup folder identified above.

KnDkfBwkaa	Physically, yes. Legally, yes, if you have a multi-user license. If you do not have the multi-user license, there is nothing that can stop you from loading the software onto 2 computers (or more). You can register the software on one computer, but not the other. The computer with the registered software can receive updates on-line, the other should not (going on-line to receive updates with a hacked version is risky).    Anyway, if you do decide to load the software onto 2 computers, without a multi-user license, both computers cannot be connected (hard line or otherwise) to an intranet and use the software at the same time. When the software is started, it looks onto the intranet that it is connected to to see if there are any other computers running the same software under the same license. If it finds a computer with that software running, it will disallow the software to open.    Some other answers give suggestions for alternative office software. Here is another. "Open Office". Its free and can open any MS word document and save documents that you are working on as MS word documents.|`|oXkNGOaWaa	yes, if u dont register it|`|foCWBdpuaa	Yes. All you have to do is keep the serial code, and use it twice. Just don't register it, and you should be fine.    Also, if you don't want to by the software you can get an app called iSerial Reader or Serial Seeker, to get the serial codes for various software.    But I would recommend getting iWork, it has everything that Microsoft Office has, but It is much easier.

KRTPJP2baa	Any site that attempts to get confidential information out of you by purporting to be something it is not. Usually initiated by mass emailing saying they are so and so bank and you need to verify your account by going to the bank's website. All they need is just a couple of people to be taken in by this and those people will find their accounts cleared out.|`|meysHMilaa	An example of a phishing e-mail, disguised as an official e-mail from a (fictional) bank. The sender is attempting to trick the recipient into revealing secure information by "confirming" it at the phisher's website. Note the misspelling of the words received and discrepancy. Such mistakes are common in most phishing emails.    In the field of computer security, phishing is the criminally fraudulent process of attempting to acquire sensitive information such as usernames, passwords and credit card details by masquerading as a trustworthy entity in an electronic communication. Communications purporting to be from popular social web sites (YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, Windows Live Messenger), auction sites (eBay), online banks (Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Chase), online payment processors (PayPal), or IT Administrators (Yahoo, ISPs, corporate) are commonly used to lure the unsuspecting. Phishing is typically carried out by e-mail or instant messaging,[1] and it often directs users to enter details at a fake website whose look and feel are almost identical to the legitimate one. Even when using server authentication it requires skill to detect that the website is fake. Phishing is an example of social engineering techniques used to fool users [2], and exploits the poor usability of current web security technologies [3]. Attempts to deal with the growing number of reported phishing incidents include legislation, user training, public awareness, and technical security measures.    A phishing technique was described in detail in 1987, and the first recorded use of the term "phishing" was made in 1996. The term is a variant of fishing,[4] probably influenced by phreaking,[5][6] and alludes to baits used to "catch" financial information and passwords.|`|hoPk1RRmaa	fake website that emulates a real website for example myspace it looks like it and w/e but its made by a hacker. when u type ur login info into it, the hacker recives the info    or if u didnt understand that.     a website that looks like another website like youtube and when u log in it will send the info to the server giving the hacker ur info which equals GG|`|gmQTb4HPaa	Hey i had that same question and i searched it on google you should go here  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing|`|zc3BoaWgaa	Phishing is when a site  misrepresents itself as someone else    A common example is when you think you are going to a bank website  and you are really router to a fraud site of someone trying to steal information from you

Its like this. if you had a friend who always told you everybody else's secrets, and you felt like you could have access to all this information e.g what they love, who they're friends with, even though you knew it wasn't healthy, wouldn't you want to hang out with them all the time?

meysHMilaa	Yes malwarebytes it is safe to use.  Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware is an anti-malware application that can thoroughly remove even the most advanced malware. It includes a number of features, including a built in protection monitor that blocks malicious processes before they even start.    Version 1.33 adds safeguard option to prevent users from losing scan results.        * "Bite back at malware"    Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is a surprisingly effective freeware antimalware tool. It's a relatively speedy malware remover, with the quick scan taking about 10 minutes. The heuristics engine proved on multiple computers during empirical testing that it was capable of determining the difference between false positives and dangerous apps.    The app has some nice features rolled in, too. It supports multiple drive scanning, context menu options including a scan-on-demand for individual files, and the FileAssassin option under the More Tools section for removing locked files. The interface is simple, but pleasant-looking and well-organized. Tabs live just below the oversized logo, with few options per tab to keep down the clutter. The installation process was fast enough, but interestingly offered up the well-kept changelog and an instant definition file update.    Do note that the real-time protection is restricted to the paid version, as is the scheduler for updates and scans. Overall, though, Malwarebytes Anti-Malware is a responsive malware remover that does what it should with a minimum of fuss. http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant...|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Affirmations to start: 1) Yes, the REAL malwarebytes is safe (see download link below).    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|kpyecsaUaa	Yes it is safe to download and use but run it in safe mode because it blue screen while trying to remove certain kind of viruses unless its in safe mode.

You can either reinstall windows, or do a windows repair. Either one will take the same amount of time.

I worked in IT in college and saw quite a few people come in for help because limewire messed up their computer. you could try to disable your firewall altogether and see if limewire works but that will leave you open for as long as the firewall is down. if limewire works when the firewall is down then you know its the firewall, if not there is something else going on with limewire. i cant really be more thorough than his without being able to see your computer, what operating system you're using, or limewires internal preferences.    that being said, try to get a torrent application like bittorrent, azerus, uTorrent (my personal favorite), or tomato torrent (for macs) that you are comfortable using, they take a little bit of effort to set up but work way better and are way safer.     good luck

It is another problem altogether, but it would not cause the dark screen issue.    If the screen is too dark to even see the screen, then the CCFL backlight that illuminates the screen has burnt out.    This happens from time to time, though fairly rare. If the computer is under warranty, it would be covered. If not, you will have to pay to have someone replace it.    As far as the missing DLL file goes, that is a file associated with MyWebSearch which is a piece of spyware/adware that is pretty annoying to get rid of.

They are always trying to improve and the stuff is a little buggy as if it is in beta. I am a gmail user (I needed ymail for a forum) and I haven't seen a single time where it seems like they are done with the thing. Google Chrome will probably stay in beta too. I believe that Google is just too lazy to make different versions of software like v.1,v.2, etc. But that is just my opinion on things. Google also can't get rid of glitches in the programs so they are in Beta until almost all of the bugs are fixed. Now here's a quick fun fact: The term bug was first used when someone found a fly in one of the first computers and it jammed the machine. So the person said that the bug was out nd the name just stuck like "a booger on a wall." And there may be legal reasons to why it is beta but I think they are using the term beta according to it's definition. If you notice, most google apps don't have more than 1 version.|`|M0HTIeutaa	google has commitment problems :/|`|079130329272342dd420898082096aeaaa	Google divides its resources between many products.

Yes,  I am more forgiving for errors because its a beta.  I appreciate that they come out with new features every couple of months.    I love the Labs area where they allow users to turn on test features.     I'm a diehard grandcentral user as well.  The word on the copper wire is that  grandcentral 2.0 is on the pipeline.

Actually, there's CHANGE POWER SETTINGS (vista) then from there you can change when your laptop goes into sleep mode.  You can select never and it should take care of the problem.  Also, you can change how your laptop reacts to when you close the lid.     Well, none the less this is the right area, RIGHT click on your desktop and find the Personalization/Settings area.

What I'm not seeing is info as to what type graphics processor you have. Some integrated graphics are better than others, but as a general rule, they aren't good for gaming. As far as upgrading your graphics, let's just say that if it was a pc, no problem, but for a laptop, I'm not going to say it can't be done, but I've never heard of it being possible.

zorYTX59aa	The basic rule is: if your "reply" is for a comment that does   not appear on the very first page, then by default it appears   as a "new comment". The exact same thing happens when  an entire sub-thread of "comments/replies" does not wholly  fit on that first page.    That is why people's "replies" to video comments often end   up as "new comments" at first but, days later, actually find  themselves underneath the comment they originally replied   to, particularly when you click on "View All Comments".|`|zWqKuIQuaa	It happens to me too, but if you check back the next day you will see that it is then placed correctly under the other persons comment.|`|6N5OjItIaa	Sometimes it doesn't do that anymore, youtube decided to make it in a different format, but what ever comment you replied to the original commenter will know you replied to them!|`|AFy5LyaGaa	it dose the same to me sometimes..    i dont know why sometimes it goes under that person you replying and sometimes it just post a comment like you are not replying..    youtube has so many glitches problem..

HcgCmPy2aa	A GUI is much easier to use, especially for people not familiar with computers.    A command line is much faster and straight forward.    Edit:  The graphical user interface (GUI) is what allows you to use icons, your mouse, windows, and almost everything else on your computer.  Because it is essentially everything that you see and is another step away from machine code (what is actually on your computer as 1's and 0's) it takes a lot longer to load and do stuff than a command prompt.  These are easier for people not that familiar with computers, because it shows people everything that they need, like icons and they can use their mouse to do a lot of things intuitively.    A command line is just text and can be compiled (turned into) machine code fairly easily, so it is a lot faster if the user knows what they are doing.    Another way to think of this is that a graphical interface is like painting everything while a command line is like just writing what it is.  It takes a lot longer to draw a picture of a tree, but it is easier to understand than just the word "tree".    I hope that clarifies things for you...

TqZWjFgEaa	a floppy drive should b 3.5 inches not 4.  you can buy a card reader for all types of memory cards.  that hooks up to a USB header on your motherboard so make sure that you have an extra one.|`|PpuOab4Gaa	The space was only designed for a floppy drive. You may find a cover for it at your nearest computer accessory store.|`|9mVjm7K1aa	honestly I'd leave it.  never say never.  been using floppies for 16 years and even tho I don't store data on them anymore, I do use them for lil memory tester and formatting software that loads onto a single floppy.    It's a boot option still on the very latest computers and you may need it someday to reload, test memory, or format your harddrive.
xMd11t6jaa	You need your "file from the internet" to be the minimum resolution as what's required by your custom poster printer (whomever they might be..). A -very- simple way to find out the resolution of the picture your interested in is to save it, then right-click on it and go to 'properties'. Under 'details' you will find out information about the photo, including it's resolution.    You also might want to read up on "EXIF Data"..    FYI, you're going to need a very high resolution photo to make into a decent poster..

a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	When you installed XP on the first partition, it automatically installed a Master Boot Record on that partition telling the computer where the operating systems are located. That includes information on where the Vista installation is located.    When you deleted that partition, you deleted the MBR with it.     To fix this, you can put the XP disk in and run "fixboot" or "fixmbr" in the recovery console.    I am not 100% sure that will recreate an MBR that will work with Vista or not, but it is the only way I know of short of reinstalling Vista completely.|`|TqZWjFgEaa	i think what happened was it configured your boot.ini file with both versions of windows and since u deleted one version u need to reconfigure the boot.ini file.|`|hH6XnjXBaa	well... as soon as the computer starts press f8 n then choose the partion that you would like to bootfrom and if that doesnt work you should like re format the HD and put vista in the operating system again|`|kpyecsaUaa	Ok you ether accidentally deleted the wrong partition or you some how damaged vista. I recommend inserting the vista instal cd and running the repair function or using a bart pe cd boot try to manually repair the damage if a file was just deleted|`|upb6PHY5aa	If I were you, I would attempt to dl the Linux Live CD so that you can rescue you files and save them to an empty hard drive, flash device, mp3 player, cd/dvd w/e.

gea8RhvYaa	I have the antec 900 case, yes it is amazing how it keeps things cool. However, I have two main criticisms on the case. You cannot turn off the blue LED lights on the fans. And the fans are not connected to the mobo, they are molex connectors, which means that you hae to manually adjust their speed. This can be a bit awkard, having to open up the case each time you want to adjust the speed. Oh yea, the fans are loud- very loud!     I went with a ATI HD 4870. As far as I know it has the best price to performance ratio on the market today- it can hold its own against Nvidia's 200 series, but doesnt cost as much.     About the Processor and the Mobo, I am not familiar with that mobo, but it what I would research is the FSB (Front side bus) in the mobo and the processor. More so than the processor speed, its the FSB speed that matters- thats the best you are going to get out of the processor. For gamming it is recommended that it be at least 800 mhz.    *can't beat newegg.com btw, my favorite site ever !|`|jwurmVbVaa	first off dual cores will always be better/ out perform single cores.    that case looks cool. nice choice :).    a nice 630 Watt PSU: it has a nice fan, 4 SATA, a 20+4 motherboard power cable and 2 Pci-e + other cables    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    a great graphics card: if you don't mind spending a lot of money you could always splurge and get a much nicer one, but for its price this card performs great.    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    if you have max ram, and that graphics card with a dual core processor, any new game should run at or near high settings.|`|TqZWjFgEaa	i have also heard that that case is really good for airflow.      i recommend coolermaster powersupplies and u can get good deals with that on newegg.com (sometimes after rebates)    a GPU i would go with a 9600gt if u want to run new games pretty good.  u can also go with an 8 series (nvidia chipsets for both) but i would go 8600gt or higher.

You can easily see what parts are being downloaded at what kB/s and how fast you're uploading when it's done.    Basically download Utorrent and use that as your default torrent program and your question will be answered.    Use Mininova.org to download your stuff if you don't know websites that host torrents.|`|AA10146029	well basically when you seed, your allowing others downloading it to take files from the file you downloaded. not nessessarily will any downloader need your seeding, so you wont always be seeding. when you remove the item off the list, it stops seeding. btw, im not a very fair p2per =) ive probably seeed 5 minutes in my entire life.|`|idNLewPDaa	what kind of torrent client are you using? that's kind of important to know.

If people in your area can connect fine then it is limited to your connection. You can flush DNS cache by going to start > run > cmd > ipconfig /flushdns I don't think you would need to do that though. Remember the basics when you first hooked up your router? Turn off the cable modem and router, if you have a battery backup you must remove that also. Wait about 1 minute. Then put battery back and plug in. After the lights go solid, plug the router back in. Connect to the network manually if it doesn't auto connect.

If youre using Windows Movie Maker, there is  the possibility that you mistakenly saved your   video as an "MSWMM" file with "Save Project"  rather than save it as an "AVI" or "WMV" with   "Save Movie File" (Win XP) or "Publish Movie"   (Vista).    There is a world of difference between the first   example and the others: not only is MSWMM   considered a "work-in-progress", it is not even   a "true" video. The other 2 examples are what  you need to properly save your file and upload  it to YouTube.    The best way to save and upload your video is:    1 -- click the blue "Tasks" icon.....(you'll get the "Movie Tasks" menu)    2 -- click "Finish Movie", the 3rd option.....(it will expand to 5 choices)    3 -- click "Save to my Computer".....(the "Save Movie" wizard appears)    4 -- enter the name of your movie.....(it is best to stay in "My Videos")    5 -- click "Next" at the bottom.....(you'll see the "Movie Setting" page)    6a -- for regular video, click "Best quality for playback".....(the default)  6b -- for 16:9, click "Compress to" and tweak it until you see 640x360    7 -- click "Next" at the bottom.....(you will get the "Completing" page)    8 -- click "Finish" at the bottom.....(the saving may take quite a while)    9 -- click the blue "Tasks" icon again.....(you'll get the "Movie Tasks")    A -- click "Finish Movie" again, the 3rd option.....(you'll get 5 choices)    B -- this time, click "Send to the Web".....(I'm sure you know the rest)    YouTube suggests that the video format be  MPEG4 at 480x360 recorded together with   sound in MP3 audio, all at a rate of greater   than 24 frames per second. Other files that  are accepted include AVI, MPG, MOV and   WMV (which is Windows Movie Maker).

It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???

Check the IP address of the computer running Windows 7.  If you are getting all 0's, try renewing the IP address.    If that doesn't get the problem fixed and you cannot get any help on Yahoo Answers, try posting this problem with as many details as you have about the situation on http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Foru...

zorYTX59aa	Unless you're prepared to pay big bucks to the corporations and  copyright owners for "licensing fees", "distribution rights", and/or  their "expressed written permission", I would not consider trying.  Don't forget that later, you'd also have to pay "royalties" for every   single time that somebody clicks on one of your videos featuring  "their music". The only possible exception to all this is if you are   the legal representative or bonded commercial agent of the artist   whose music you want to use -- but if that were indeed the case,   you probably wouldn't be asking this question on Yahoo!    Whatever you do, DO NOT write the name of the music, artist or   record label in your title, description or tags. Also avoid pedantic  sentences like "no copyright infringement intended", "I don't own   the music" or "I do not take any credit for the music." YouTube's  computers servers actively search for phrases like that. Besides,  all it does is reaffirm that you have knowingly taken/used/copied  or maybe even stolen someone else's copyrighted material.|`|AFy5LyaGaa	you can only use song that is not copy rights.. i know youtube being a lately..|`|D4cY5FwLaa	I'd upload it how it is then mention the artist and title then add in the comments pretty sweet song and i do not own just thought it was good song people aren't as offended and wont report thats what i do for most mine but someone got pissed off over my souldja boy video that was pretty funny cuz someone tackled while they were doing it but i didnt say any of that so you know maybe i should of.|`|oMDWK71raa	Best bet is too try an find songs that can work on you tube before postin or makin the amv--- it doesn't seem fair but the legal system says it is.

SkpRC2Nmaa	Try to run a scan of scandisk    go to my computer >> right click at the HDD unit >> properties>> tools tab >> scandisk check now option
dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !    And as a bonus, your computer will be cleaner and probably a bit zippier ( all that for free ! )|`|I4nM5QyTaa	thats what i have.. i have no idea how to remove it
UV8bN0Giaa	I do a lot of EBAY (608+ feedback) and my wife lately has had me buying computer software programming books (3) so far.  I use BookFinder4U as my primary ISBN search engine and 90% of books I buy are on Half.com, EBAY and then Amazon.      FYI on the 3 recent computer programming books, after I paid them with my credit card HALF.com sent me the Buyer an email with the subject line: ORDER CONFIRMED that the body contains the Transaction .  Then a day or so later, I received separate emails from each of the 3 HALF Sellers with the subject line: SELLER CONFIRMATION: Your Order Has Been Shipped that also has the same transaction   and date shipped etc.    Hope the Above Info Helps!
1yov0JF9aa	sounds like you have a registry problem too. something in the registry is restoring the index.dat file.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	In Microsoft Internet Explorer (IE), The index.dat file functions as an active database, which runs as long as a user is logged on in Windows.     It functions as a repository of redundant information, such as web URLs, search queries and recently opened files.    It is always there and can make you feel that you are spied on !      Here are two programs I use for removing these pesky things !    I have included the links and the descriptions for them.    http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/Index-d...    Index.dat Suite allows you to find, inspect and delete all index.dat files on your computer. The index.dat files are used by Internet Explorer to store references to previously visited web sites and cookies. They are not deleted by simply emptying the browser cache, but require manual deletion and a reboot. This little tool makes it easy to find the files, view the content of them, and then optionally delete all or selected index.dat files.      http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/indexda...    Index.dat Analyzer is a simple tool to view and delete the content of index.dat files that contain references to cookies, browser history and cached pages. The entries are normally not removed by simply clearing the cache in your browser. Index.dat Analyzer enables you to review those entries, and optionally delete them, or extract files to a different folder.      WARNING: As with all powerful programs, please TAKE CARE in using them unless you know what you are doing.     Read the help and instructions first or you might end up unable to log into windows.      And remember, they will ALWAYS be there as they are a part of the "Windows" system, the programs I listed will erase the data in them by deletion but on the next boot up, Windows will replace them with new empty copies !

XXyc6t6oaa	Free way if your on a wireless network:  Hook both computers up to the network and run HFS server on your sons computer.  (no installation need, its one single exe)  http://www.rejetto.com/hfs/    Drag and Drop the files/folders you want to transfer on the menu screen.    log onto laptop > enter your sons internal ip address into your internet browsers url box, should say it on the hfs screen (ex 192.168.2.3)  You should come to a webpage that listed the files you added click on them to download them.    A lot simpler than it sounds|`|f9gcRmhGaa	Sure! You can use a USB flash drive.     You can put all your data on the flash drive and just keep it there and then access it from whatever computer you may be using.  There's no need to be copying files back and forth from the flash drive to the hard drive and back again.     When you plug the flash drive into a PC it will recognize it and assign it a drive letter. So just use your software and open the file straight from the flash drive and then save it back to the flash drive.    Get the biggest (and best rated)  one you can afford.  Those video files use a lot of space.  www.newegg.com is a great source, if you're in the US.|`|5jfzvw7oaa	make sure the computers are far enough apart for the file cabinet to fit through........lol|`|TqZWjFgEaa	i would say an external hard drive also.  yes u could use a flash drive but its better to have an external hard drive.  I say that becuase u should always back up your files on your computer to protect in case something happens to your computer.  backups can really save time and prevent data lose.  it is worth it to spend it because u will b using it more then once.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Flash drive will work, I just bought two 16 gig drives at Amazon for $32|`|YVE64dJUaa	yes you can use a flash disk that will be fine    if all the files together are more than the capacity of the flash disk then transfer the files and delete the files off of the flash disk and repeat make sure that the files transferred are not shortcuts to the originals (i've done that before :S) also make sure you transfer the files to a place you can find again the desktop is a good place :D    enjoy your new computer|`|3tYt8aF8aa	Flash drive should work
AA12194329	It depends. I'm assuming with network connection your referring to your internet speed? Either way both the airwaves from your wireless router and if you are using a cable modem they are shared bandwidth. If uncle is downloading lots of DVD size movies and you get on to do anything then that is your issue. Also with cable modems the time of day and peak usage is a factor. Again shared bandwidth. If ATT does DSL then you have to remember you only have so much bandwidth even if 8Mbps sounds like a lot. Are you guys doing peer to peer file sharing software?|`|AA11947951	kick uncle off|`|5P0yQm6Qaa	Yes it will effect your bandwidth if he is downloading or on a big website/page.

If its a lot slower than its your connection.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Yes, it's normal. It's called SHARING.  You have a finite resource - a wireless connection.

Keep tapping the button and see if you get a screen for Starting the restore.    If neither of those work then you need to use the disk.Place the disk in the DVD drive and reboot.Go to bios and look for Boot Sequence and choose CD ROM as first boot device.  save settings and exit bios.  A screen will appear asking if you want to boot to the CD.Tap any key to start the install.

Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    In your case, try to do it in Windows "safe" mode or if you have a router, do step B  8 first and then start from the beginning.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|uuDloQnCaa	By blank do you mean when you reach the desktop theres no icons? if you can access the task manager try clicking file > new task > type: explorer.exe > press enter. should bring your icons back.

How to stop pop-ups and remove fake software, spyware, trojans and viruses:    Download, install, update and scan your computer with both Malwarebytes and SuperantiSpyware, delete anything they find, if this fails to completely remove the virus/spyware download then update Avast and run a boot scan (click schedule boot-time scan and restart your PC), all the software below is free and safe to use.

Download, install, update and scan with the following free:    AVG Free from http://free.avg.com/ - this is an anti-virus, ensure that you only have one anti-virus program installed on your computer    You can have multiple anti-spyware/malware/adware programs to scan, ensure they are legitimate.

38MPmsaKaa	This is a safety advice to protect yor system in case installing  service pack 3 fails. In 99 % it will not fail. The Servive pack 3  stores any replaced files in the windows directory, therefore an  undo or uninstall is not a problem. Once you installed it, test the  function of your programs (usually no problems, shutdown may be  slower). When you are sure that service pack 3 causes no failures,  you even can delete the backuped files in the windows directory.  Uninstall of Service pack 3 would not be possible then.  But you can free a lot of HD space, if you need it.|`|veMA1a6paa	what you need to do is go to the system restore and just set a restore point. Then download service pack 3.

If you want to start your website I recommend purchase your domain and hosting together. In this way it is possible to get your domain for free. Some hosting services offer this gift today.    As an experienced webmaster I recommend BlueHost service which Im sure it would work for you and fulfill all your requirements.

meysHMilaa	Sounds like quite an issue. Let's start off by running the System File Checker Utility (SFC):  Hold the Window key and press R. Type sfc /scannow in the Run window, and press Enter.    If SFC does identify missing or corrupted Operating System files, it may ask you to insert your Windows XP installation CD so a fresh copy of the correct file can be copied and pasted into the system files.    If you do not have your Windows XP installation CD, or if errors in the process occur, please post back with specifics or questions.    SFC scan and replacements take about 8-12 minutes depending upon the size of your file tree and the speed of your CPU/RAM. If SFC opens and then closes within a few seconds or under one minute, It did not complete, and must be repeated.    Sometimes, a second scan run of SFC is necessary, even if SFC completes the first time, in order to replace all missing or corrupted files. If SFC completes, you can safely run it a second time for good measure.    A good way to tell whether you should run it again is if you look in the Event Log and see the following Application event entry after running SFC:|`|vo42ZRPdaa	you did not get the whole program try re downloading it|`|a2ZUE0U5aa	Yes I agree.

AedQcjKUaa	About the only thing you can do other than replacing the processor is adding more memory or deleting programs and files to free up memory.  There are certain things that you can do to increase load time for programs (such as using speek disk or other programs that stack your data to access it more quickly, or overclocking as was mentioned) but to get the computer to operate more quickly in general, memory or the processor is it.|`|vHxauOyeaa	look into overclocking.  or get 200 dollars together and buy pos vista machine.    go into your bios and change the processor speed and the FSB (Front Side Bus) speed.|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	For the most part, there is not much you can do.     There is an option of overclocking the CPU, but it is not an easy task on a pre-built computer like Acer.    What you are going to want to do is find out what the current clock speed of the processor is, and then find the FSB and multiplier switches or pins on the motherboard while the computer is off.    Then simply increase the multiplier a few notches. You are not going to be able to go very far, but even a 66mhz overclock is going to be a decent performance boost considering the base clock speed.    Don't expect this to make the computer amazing, it is probably going to be about 10% faster tops.     But it is better than nothing.    The good thing is that Windows 2000 (not Windows ME, there is a BIG difference) will run relatively smooth on a PII computer. It does not require a lot of Ram to run and should be your best option.    What exactly are you planning on using it for?|`|jaAolejUaa	delete viruses  defrag  delete programs u do not need|`|79fa22b0bfcb741ebea37f6761d4896aaa	overclocking and decreasing ram usage.

Since, you said you do not have "no money" then try to install less programs/software, simply install those software or programs that you use the most.  This procedure would help you to load software little faster.  Since, Pentium II is out of date and it is impossible to make it run as fast as Pentium III.|`|55c1d74ea3f28f36e0572a05769f11d3aa	then keep away from Windows period,  there are other operating systems better. faster, more secure, and most of all FREE, with all the free software that you will ever need free including lots of educational software, that is used in schools Linux will run on old 386,and 486 as well as new computers, and you don't need loads of memory to run it     have a look at the links below to download free linux operating systems and software|`|7vh5fOeRaa	First thing I would recommend:  do NOT upgrade to Windows 2000.    Think of it this way:  at 11 years old, your computer was built in 1998.  Windows 2000 came out two years after that computer was built.  If you are looking to speed the computer up, you certainly don't want to put an operating system on it that will have HIGHER hardware requirements than the current operating system you are using.    What you really should do is completely reformat your hard drive so it's totally clean and then re-install Windows 98.  Once you have a nice clean copy of Windows 98 installed, go to these links:  http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/...  http://www.litepc.com/98lite.html    Follow the directions on the links; they will help you optimize your operating system for the best possible speed.    Overclocking the hardware is an option... but I wouldn't recommend it.  Overclocking is very hard on the hardware, and is best left to enthusiasts and people with LOTS of experience tinkering inside a computer.  And, since you say you don't have a lot of money to work with, you definately don't want to take a chance overclocking and end up breaking your computer!  You'd then be out a working PC with no money to replace it.    Long story short... blow out the hard drive, re-install and optimize Windows 98 and stretch as much out of that computer as you can until you can save up to buy a new one.  Most importantly... don't spend another single dime on that old computer!  Any money you'd spend would be much better set aside for a new computer down the road.    Hope that helps!!|`|XVpq4tOQaa	You cannot upgrade the actual speed of a processor, but the person above it right, if you are not going to speed any money then just try and clean up the computer all you can!|`|ZdZlNAa2aa	How much money do you have?

Just save up money to buy a new computer. You can go to your local library and the computers will be 10 times as fast as that thing.    Just, look on your local craigslist. Somebody, will be selling a stolen computer... Take that thing off his hands for a few hundred bucks.     Putting money or Time into that computer would be like trying to outfit a sunken titanic for another passenger trip.    Old things should have the dignity to RIP. Old people know this.

AVCeK28Faa	the monitor is not actually connected to the server i think, it still has to be connected to a different system unit that is connected to the server.it is a server centric network so you should need a client and a server.unless you have a monitor that has a built in system unit like the ones with apple.i dont know if i got it right but itts just my opinion ^_^|`|AVDTZ63Oaa	You are talking about Thin Client systems. Or maybe Thick clients.    I can tell you that the Library isn;t running any Q6600 3 gig with gigs of ddr 800 behind it. You will be FINE with that as a master server.     Here's an article from Bill on how to set it all up in Windoz:  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/...    If you REALLY want to have some fun though you will do this with Posix. My Suggestion would be to do it using the Ubuntu LTSP system since it sing like a nightingale on that machine:  http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/...|`|LFWWPgpQaa	There are two ways this is done.    Options 1 is in hardware, where you are running thin clients that really have no OS and boot off the network. This is not really feasable at home.    Option 2 is to run a form of terminal server which is basicly a server that allows multiple remote logins.  You could set this up via Linux or Windows (and more im sure that Im not experianced with).    For Windows you will need Windows 2000/2003/2008 Server and when installing select terminal server.  Each PC can have Windows or Linux installed which automaticly opens an RDP (remote desktop connection) to the server.    For Linux install your fav distro e.g. Fedora or Ubuntu and look at setting up remote access to X server  Then using PC's with Linux (tiny cut down distro's that have just enough to login in to a remote X Server are best).    The schools from when I was a kid used Novel Netware as their login/thin client system, Novel now own Suse Linux which you could use as an alternative.    To clarify though, this would be a huge pain in the *** unless you have a really really good reason to be doing it, you cant play games or anything accross a thin client system.  This is normaly done so that you can have a very powerfull back end server handling 100% of the load instead of paying for High end desktops, each year or two instead of having to replace every desktop you just upgrade the server and suddenly everything is faster. Its a great system for buisinesses but I dont see what benefit you would get at home.|`|0fb8bc0361a3c044e8ab71aede839879aa	The ones I've seen use Windows XP that login to a domain.

TXJXcVu0aa	As the first poster stated and as i answered your question a couple of days ago this is your codec.    A film comes with compression and to read that film a de-compressor is needed. This is called a codec. The reason you can hear sound is because the film you have downloaded most likely has video encoded in DIVX and sound encoded in MP3. Your computer already has the sound codec so it needs the divx codec.    All the codecs you will ever need are included in this pack:  http://www.free-codecs.com/k_lite_Codec_...    Download the basic codec pack and you will be able to watch your film in both windows media player 11 and VLC.    Its strange why you chose a best answer for your question last time when you said downloading VLC solved your problem when clearly it did not.|`|MxculX2Daa	It is nothing to do with the media players - its your codecs.  Codecs are decoders for video formats and there are a lot of them around in common use.    Suggest you download "k-lite codec pack" - the basic or standard one will be enough. Do a google for it.  You will then find that your videos will play on all of the media players you have.|`|AolmUGQxaa	I had the same problem with Vista and I contacted Support who were able to fix this problem within a matter of hours.|`|UpcGpCm9aa	you might have to choose vlc or media player 11 as your primary media device. and it could be in conflict with other devices such as real player and others that you downloaded.. there could be a problem also with the size and format of your videos and music that you use so they need to be converted to a type that works for your chosen path   there are so many video and music converters out there to download freely but not always as free as they say and you need to register and even pay a price for the full versions that work fully in syncronicity

meysHMilaa	Mozilla Firefox is a fast, full-featured Web browser. Firefox includes pop-up blocking; tab-browsing; integrated Google search; simplified privacy controls; a streamlined browser window that shows you more of the page than any other browser; and a number of additional features that work with you to help you get the most out of your time online.    Version 3.0.5 added official releases for the Bengali, Esperanto, Galician, Hindi, and Latvian languages; replaced the End-User License Agreement with a new "Know Your Rights" info bar on initial install; fixed several security and stability issues.        * "A skillful and secure Web-surfing tool"    Read CNET senior editor Rob Vamosi's extended review of Firefox 3.    No longer a fledgling upstart, Firefox 3 is full-featured, lightning fast, and an able Internet Explorer foe. Previous versions have seen Mozilla's approach to features such as tabbed browsing and extensions become extremely popular. Even though Firefox 3 lacks a killer feature, it offers significant improvements not to be missed.    Version 3 introduces a multitude of safety and usability features. The location bar drop-down menu now includes URLs from both your browsing history and your bookmarks. A new Add-Ons manager includes a built-in plug-in search engine, saving you the previous trip to the Mozilla Web site. Single-click the star icon on the right of the location bar to bookmark the current page, or double-click on it to simultaneously add and edit the bookmark entry. You can tag bookmarks, too. Other impressive new features include password confirmation before adding it to the saved passwords list, the ability to pause and resume downloads, and merged forward and backward history lists.    Firefox 3 now runs faster and, according to Mozilla, is less susceptible to hacks and other vulnerabilities. The browser now warns your system's antivirus program when you download a file, and anti-malware and anti-phishing utilities now throw up a warning page before allowing Firefox to load risky sites. The favicon reveals Web sites' ownership details and displays the security level of your connection to that site.    Developers will appreciate that Firefox 3's new graphics and text rendering code provide rendering improvements in CSS and SVG as well as improved display of fonts and complex scripts. Firefox 3--still open-source, as ever--is a browser that all users should consider making their default Web-surfing tool.http://www.download.com/mozilla-firefox/...|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	A handy arrangement is 'dual browser' session:  You can have as many different browsers open as you want at the same time , without significant slowdowns (if the site is not overly 'robust').  Attacks from the internet, using 'blended' methods are becoming more pronounced & Windows users are especially vulnerable due to the systems flexibility which permits remote machines to enter & access other 3rd party applications on your machine and get it to do something it was not intended to do.  This is especially true of using browsers as 'launchpads' for payload delivery.  IE, being deeply woven into Windows, is a prime target, and makes using Firefox, with 'noScript' add on even more urgent.     Use Firefox for general & everyday surfing needs, especially to sites you don't know anything about.  Depending on how many plug-in's and add-on's you "hang" onto FF, it's faster than IE, & inherently safer.  Download site: http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/    Try viewing a site with FF first, and if it does not allow the interaction you require, switch & use IE (via "copy" the URL from FF & "paste" into IE) but only when it's absolutely necessary; or to use 'Active X' or 'Flash' scripting: Use these at your own peril.    Flip back to FF when finished.  Special note for both browsers:  "Logged In" sites must be "logged out" when finished, to terminate 'session cookies'.  **************  Note:  Current threats include 'Antivirus 2009' or variants.  Because architecture of the Internet (notably 'Flash' scripting), vulnerabilities are readily exploited in Internet Explorer, & it is now >>urgent  NoScript: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox...|`|pdW8jMQoaa	Definitely.

Firefox is faster, more secure, doesn't remind you of Vista (which in my opinion is a sin against humanity), and conforms better to website coding standards, so theoretically it will work better.  I think Google Chrome is the best browser, because it is faster and cleaner than any other common web browser.|`|1uJ9oy0Haa	It's a lot faster and a lot more safer.

I can hack the hell out of internet explorer. There was just recently a virus that basically infected only internet explorer users and stole all there saved passwords, remembered sites and many other items of value. Also I would like to add, If i wanted all your information i could plug a usb device (ipod, zune, flash drive etc.) into your computer and I would have more information than your can imagine.  You should have your dad ask there head IT guy at the office if he uses Internet Explorer. He will tell you no way. If he still will not believe you do this.    Get a usb drive. (it does not have to be big)    Download this     http://www.usbhacks.com/wp-content/uploa...    and open the folder and put it on the flash drive. Now next time you plug it into his computer you have all his information. It is stored in the "Dump" folder.      This is just the start of what is possible to hack on internet explorer.      Move to FIRE FOX NOW !!!!!

Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	When PC's (personal confusers) misbehave, one step to help reduce annoying pop-ups & unrequested websites from being displayed on your machine is to turn off 3rd party cookies, and always leave them off.  ****************  INTERNET EXPLORER: Tools> Internet Options> Privacy> Advanced:   here check 'Override automatic....'; 'Allow session cookies';  'Allow 1st party cookies' & 'Block 3rd Party Cookies'.

The 9500gt is a step down from the 9600gt, which can handle Crysis on medium.      The 2.6ghz is a decent core speed, and nice cpu.  The only thing holding you back is the graphics card.    Yes you can play Crysis no problem on medium settings, I'd turn down water and shadow effects for more detail in other areas.  I would also leave Anti Aliasing off.

Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !

Of course, if you do wish to agree with other users instead of using McAfee or ZoneAlarm, give a try with avast!, Avira (only if you pay, it is useless with only antivirus engine), AVG if prefered, or check up VB100% awards and see which one is currently passing a lot.
WS95be3Raa	You manipulate the function, until you can find simpler function that's always greater at some point.    For example, I will do the function that you've posted:    1/2n^2 + 3n + 4     Notice that I just made every coefficient to be n^2. Such function will always be greater at some point. Ignore the constant (15/2) and you get the answer - n^2.    EDIT: I got 15/2 by adding all coefficients in the right equation (1/2 + 3 + 4).

dd972fe41498b1facdc135b671c1d469aa	Stage lighting board operation and programming.     I don't know exactly which board was used, but probably either an Avolites Perl or a flying pig systems (yes really) hog II. There are however multiple possibilities but in reality most boards have the same kind of facilities. In many cases you can download an 'off line editor' from the desk manufacturers web site that you can play with on a PC to learn your way around.     There probably would also have been media servers involved,  but there are a huge variety of possibilities there.     Now, if you meant that you wanted to know how to design such shows, as opposed to merely being the guy who programs the show (a skill in itself), then that gets into the field of 'lighting design' about which much has been written and would also touch on such things as event power distribution and (these days) computer networking.     For lighting for telly (which is a very different animal to lighting for a live audience) you might want to find a broadcast specific course, but for general event lighting here is a somewhat UK centric perspective: http://www.ald.org.uk/training/    HTH.

You can change the color by going to cell format.|`|g62ATenqaa	Conditional formatting is the way to colour certain cells, but this will be based on a value.  If, however, you have 2007, colouring of cells is on the ribbon under the Home menu, but you could alwys in any case simply format cells to be a certain colour without conditional formatting.  However, as far as I know there is no automatic way to count those coloured cells automatically. You could set up a macro I suppose to do a count or sum function and then click in the relevantly coloured cells, but if the number of coloured cells changes a macro wouldnt work and would have to be done each time. I suppose though if you used a countif function in the cell where you want to give a value again this would have to be done on each occasion, rather than macro.

g7M1DxFCaa	Browse the internet for a program called 'VistaBootPRO'.  Many sites sell it but I know that it exists for free because I downloaded it myself but unfortunately I don't have a link for it, you'll have to look yourself.    Install it, then when you run it you'll be asked to make a backup of the boot system on the drive.  You'll probably have no choice on it's first run so just do it, then you can delete it anyway once everything's fixed.  Now, Click the 'System Bootloader' button/tab at the top of the window.  Select the 'Windows Vista Bootloader' option on the first line and 'All Drives' on the second.  Uncheck the 'Force Bootloader Install' box at the bottom.  Click the 'Install Bootloader' button at the bottom of the window.  Now if you restart it should all be fixed, this is the easiest way to do this that I've found, a great little program and simple to use.  If it still hasn't set up both your operating systems then use the options on the 'Manage OS Entries' tab to make it find them all.    Two good points about this program are firstly that it doesn't matter whether you install XP or Vista first, it'll work.  You have to be logged in with administrator rights in Vista or logged onto the actual administrator account in XP (with 'administrator' as the user name - press CTRL-ALT-DEL on XP's welcome screen and you'll get a box you can put your name into - password should be blank unless you set one)    The second good thing is that there's no need to mess about with BCDedit or any command line work.

There are thousands of online scams that have you do a survey just to get your information or to give your malware or a virus.

There are so many sites online like hulu and http://www.ovguide.com that you can just stream movies from for Free.     But having boxee on your aTV makes it so that you can access sites like that through the aTV - which is really unique. It just depends on what you are looking for i suppose.    You should be able to download the program (dmg file) to your desktop if you really want to use Boxee on your laptop ... once downloaded you should be able to access the application..

GuBnmZ8naa	Question seems pretty clear to me.  You want a core 2 Duo that matches your old processor in horsepower.    benchmarks  p4 at 2.4ghz = 349  Intel Core2 Duo T5270 @ 1.40GHz = 674    The lowest end core 2 duo i could find scored twice as high as your p4.      note that core 2 duo is a more specific then dual core.  core 2 duo is a specific line from intel.  there are probably amd dual cores, and other intel dual cores that score lower.    http://www.cpubenchmark.net/|`|a00a78740b4cb65d519bfb84e169590eaa	Wait,    Are you asking which processor will fit in a laptop that used to have a 2.4ghz P4 installed?    If so, then you should know that only a P4 processor will be able to be installed in that laptop, and you probably could not go much faster.    Or are you just asking which processor will perform about the same as the 2.4ghz P4?    I would say ANY core 2 duo CPU that is clocked faster than 1.8ghz.|`|XlyLakYAaa	Any Core 2 Duo would be faster than a Pentium 4 2.4Ghz.  Most Pentium Dual-Cores are also faster than a Pentium 4 @ 2.4GHz.|`|I51RUYZraa	The reason why an equivalent processor to the Pentium 4 is because it is old technology that can be outperformed at lower clock speeds.  The last chip to get similar architecture to the Pentium 4 would be the Pentium M which performed a good bit better and ran a bit cooler.  Even the lowest end Core 2 has more FSB then the very fastest P4 and the cache sizes a roughly larger as well reducing bottleneck at the ram.|`|8nLuyDmPaa	Okay.    I see this question and ask myself why are you looking for an older processor for a laptop that is "like" another older processor.    Are you looking at specifications on a software package that states it runs on the processor mentioned?  They should always include the two words "or better".  I know it probably does not, but any new Dual or Quad core Intel chip runs circles around an old P4.  Don't pay attention to the 2.4 Ghz since it was talking about for a P4.    If you need to buy a processor for an older laptop, you would have to find out exactly what kinds of processors would work on the laptop you are looking at.  More than likely, you are stuck with what it has.
FBQZ06vraa	Your best bet is to turn off Track Changes and accept all current changes.  This will not only get rid of the markup, but save space in the file.  Here's how:    1. Click the Review tab on the Ribbon.  2. In the Changes group, click the arrow under "Accept".    3. Click Accept All Changes In Document.  4. In the Tracking group, the Track Changes icon should be selected.  Click it to unselect it.    Hope that helps.
dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT do not use AVG free (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|uuDloQnCaa	Check your system for a trojan called TDSSserv.sys which can prevent you from downloading and running security software.    start > run > type: devmgmt.msc > enter > view > show hidden devices > non-plug and play drivers > TDSSserv.sys > right click > disable > restart computer.    How to stop pop-ups and remove fake software, spyware, trojans and viruses:    Download, install, update and scan your computer with both Malwarebytes and SuperantiSpyware, delete anything they find, if this fails to completely remove the virus/spyware download then update Avast and run a boot scan (click schedule boot-time scan and restart your PC), all the software below is free and safe to use.    Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    SuperantiSpyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/    Avast Anti-Virus: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    To protect your PC in the future you'll need to install anti-virus software and a firewall, id recommend using Avast and Comodo Pro firewall both are very effective and completely free, you should also switch to Firefox 3 if you are browsing with IE as its much safer and a lot easier to use.

cLzxtmpCaa	I am not sure with macs, because i deffintly prefer mircosoft, but you can try to defragment the harddrive.   All this does is rearange the data on your harddrive which will also speed your computer up.  This may take a very long time and when it is running DO NOT DO ANYTHING with you computer, even move the mouse, as it will cause it to restart.    This may also be helpful, whenever you delete a file or folder on your computer is is syill on the harddrive, but the directory is deleted, so you cant see it but it is still there.  Your computer can write information over it thou.

HBAMQJPLaa	I run MS Office 97 on my  one of my VISTA computers.    But the XP version is just for XP, I think.    Just buy MS office 2003 or 2007.    Or get openofffiec which is free.    PS There is a Run As Older Version of OS option in VISTA too.  That might work.|`|a4LWildhaa	Hmmm. This could screw up your computer, as they are not compatible operating systems I was told. Better have a competent IT guy do it. My IT guy (and my son who works for Apple Computer) do not advise installing Vista yet. They say it's still got major flaws.
E5mFWOqqaa	The T6600 is better. Here's why.    1. Clock Speed. It's 2.4GHz, while the P7450 is 2.16GHz  2. Cache size. The T6600 has a 4MB cache while the P7450 has only 3MB. Not a large difference, but still a difference.    There are other reasons why the T6600 is better, but these are the main two. Note though that these may not also be 100% correct- I just quickly Googled the specs of the two processors, so the specs may be slightly off. I'd still go with the T6600 though.|`|G1WYQFMRaa	Go here for the answers.    http://www.intel.com/consumer/learn/proc...

2iS8SooIaa	The first one with the Intel Core 2 Duo. This processor is good and fast for your basic needs. 2GB of ram enables faster use. Plus it has a bigger hard drive for storage of school work. The Intel Celeron has slower performance. It has less RAM for slower processes. And it's only a 4-cell battery that can last up to only 1hr30 - 2hr. The first one is a much better choice.|`|3pMVVZ3Taa	If you don't need a computer for games, graphics intensive apps(CAD, photoshop, etc.) or HD media, my suggestion is the cheapest laptop you can find. I would recommend wireless, but for surfing the web that is the only real thing of any importance. Celeron is always going to be slower than core 2 duo, but not necessary. 1 or 2 gigs of memory should be good.

However, the bottom one is clearly a Dell Vostro, which is a pile of crud piled together.     You could probably survive with the bottom one- a lot of people probably could- but the top one is much better.    That being said though, if you are looking at buying a Dell for college, you're insane. The specs you quoted on both laptops aren't found in the Dell laptops that could be considered. Any Dell laptop that's under about $900 is going to be made with as cheap parts as Dell can find, which means that you're going to end up in about 2 years with a laptop you want to toss out the window.|`|BAvysFrGaa	I'm on a Mac Book the internet surfing is insanely fast.

Fp0jrUtOaa	Relational queries like this are much more easily handled in a database program like MS Access.  Excel can give you an answer but it's not going to be as elegant or simple as Access.    That said, there are several workarounds that jump to mind to answer this in Excel.  An easy one would involve creating two hidden columns in your first spreadsheet.  In the first open column (which in your example above would be column F, I believe), type    = A2 & MONTH(C1)  which will return "Trainee 12" - Trainee 1 in second month  In the next column, add    = A2 & MONTH(E2)    On your new tab, fill cell B2 with    = SUMIF(Sheet1!$F:$F, $A2&MONTH(B$1), Sheet1!$B:$B) + SUMIF(Sheet1!$G:$G, $A2&MONTH(B$1), Sheet1!$D:$D)     (Note:  The value "January" in cell B1 must be entered as the actual date, not as a text value with the name of the month.)    Copy that formula to your other months and trainees.    If you like, you can go back and hide columns F and G on the first tab.
4MYWPD9Yaa	It's a desktop publishing program, so any kind of printed thing that requires a layout would be appropriate for it.    Unfortunately, Microsoft Publisher is just about the last program you should use for desktop publishing (apart from Microsoft Word, which people often use for layouts, even though it is only a word processor).    InDesign is the best desktop publishing program, but it is expensive.  Scribus is a good desktop publishing program and is free.  Microsoft Publisher is an okay desktop publishing program but costs money.    So if you're going to shell out cash, I'd recommend InDesign. If you can't afford InDesign, I'd recommend Scribus.    The only situation in which I could recommend Microsoft Publisher is if you're exchanging documents with people who insist on using Microsoft Publisher.|`|XlyLakYAaa	It's for making all kinds of things like banners, cards, fliers, brochures, etc.  I suppose you could make a book cover with it as well.
Fp0jrUtOaa	If your row of values is in row 1 and starts at column A, the simplest formula that jumps to mind is    =offset( A1, 0, COUNTA(1:1) - 1)    That will always pick the right-most entry in row 1 which is what I assume you meant by "most recent".|`|WwXrTQgaaa	There is no built in function to do this.

FBQZ06vraa	A product key is a 25-character string Microsoft uses to let its programs know you've paid for them.      It sounds like you have a trial version of Microsoft Office that was good for 25 uses or 60 days.  At the end of that time it stops letting you edit your files or create new ones.  You have to purchase Microsoft Office 2007, or at least Word 2007, to do that.    Note:  The 25-character product key on the computer case or laptop bottom is NOT the key for MS Office.  Its only for the Windows operating system.    First, if you're a student, you may qualify for the Student edition of Office at a pretty good price:    http://www.microsoft.com/student/discoun...    Second, if youre interested in buying Word, check out this URL, especially the second group of listings.     http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/produc...    Note that the higher of the two prices quoted is for a full version of that program and the lower, for upgrades from existing software.  Read the list of upgrade-qualifying software carefully:  MS Works is often one, and may have come on your machine.    Finally, if you have files that are locked up in the new Word 2007 file format (.docx), heres a possibility for salvaging them.  Microsoft offers a free Compatibility pack that allows earlier versions of Word to read Word 2007 files.  If you have access to an earlier version, this can at least give you back your documents.  Some new features of Word 2007 will be lost or converted to straight text in the conversion to the earlier version.    Good luck.|`|7igxiGrAaa	The product key is the serial number.

VSqk5zpnaa	Unfortunately, there is nothing you can do. Myspace does this so - for example - once I used a sound recorder program on my computer to get a band's song off myspace and it sounded terrible, if it were better quality I have a feeling myspace would think users are doing the same thing as I - you can't change anything. When you download the song though everything should sound the same but when uploaded myspace screws with it.

Crossover cables can run $25 easy, and a basic workgroup switch is $20 with a regular ethernet at $10 or so, plus you can then put a few more devices in.

80e9b302f1ee300cac6fea79c460458faa	First, there is a difference between RAM and disk drive.    RAM is the memory of the computer.  This is where the computer program are setting when you are using one of them.    Disk drive is where the computer stores things.    The next step will vary based upon your operating system.  On my Windows XP, I select MY COMPUTER.  Then select one of my hard drives and click on it.  Look at the list of names you have - is there anything you can delete or erase (there is a difference.  ERASE removes the file - wipes that storage area clean.  DELETE really just removes the Table of Contents pointer to that file - it does not release the space the file is using nor does it remove the data in that file).  Be careful that you do not delete a file required by one of your software packages.    Once you have deleted as many files as possible, then you might want to run a disk compression or de-fragmentation software.  Basically what this does is you now have a disk drive that has places that are not being used - most of these probably came where you just deleted those files.      If you go to SAVE a new file, and there is not a piece of disk storage big enough to handle your request - the operating system pieces together several empty places to obtain the total amount of space you need.  Some people call this "daisy chaining" the storage.  Problem with daisy-chaining is when you go to read that file - the system has to read each piece seperately - it would be more efficient if there were fewer pieces or/and if all of the pieces were side-by-side of each other.  So defragmantation re-writes all of the files together - one right after the other - and by doing this - it eliminates all of the little pieces of empty spaces - when it finishes it has put as many of the empty spaces together as it can.    A good thing to do before you start any of this - is to make a back-up or recovery copy of your disk drive.  Just in case you erase or delete something you should have kept.|`|LFWWPgpQaa	First thing first, goto My Computer.  Right click your C: Drive and select properties, this will show you how much space you have free, not much im guessing.    The first thing you should do is run Windows XP DiskCleanup tool. It may not be super effective but it will happily go along and delete all files you dont need (this is the safest place to start you cant BREAK your computer doing this). - see sources for a link to Microsfot Knowledge base on how to use this tool.    Once you have run this, go and check your free space again, you need at least 1-2GB or 1-2000MB for Windows XP to have enough room to run well, otherwise you can run out of virtual memory.    The second thing you can do is go into your documents/pictures/downloads/movies etc and delete some, then empty the recycle bin to really get them off your PC.    If you still have no room it might be time to upgrade your hardware.|`|sXgg2si7aa	get a new hard drive, it has too little room, go to bestbuy and ask those mindless goons about it|`|saWJM651aa	That would mean that your RAM is almost out of storage room on the hard drive.      Go into the control panel and clean up your system.  Find a title like system and maintenance.  Defrag also, just look around in the control panel if you don't find it in the system and maintenance.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Assuming you truly don't have much disk space left, you need to delete files and folders that you are sure you don't need.  Don't delete anything unless you know exactly what it is and you're sure you don't need it (like things you created yourself and no longer need).  If possible, back everything up to a safe place before deleting it (that is, copy it to another disk, or burn it onto a CD, before deleting it).    If that doesn't free up enough space, you may have to buy a bigger disk. If you're not a computer geek, you'll probably need to get professional help to install the disk.|`|a2ZUE0U5aa	If you are using a windows machine you should go to     Start > Control Panel > Add Or remove applications    In this menu you can remove old programs that you no longer use.     The other option would be to purchase an external hard drive for data backup.     You could move over all your important files to the external hard drive.   Note: these are also nice to keep in a safe or any ware you keep important information.    Some of the best sites to find a good price on external hard drives are  http://www.newegg.com/  http://www.tigerdirect.com/  http://www.buy.com/  http://www.amazon.com/    If you need a step by step email your question and what operating system you are using to me at c4bjenglacious@yahoo.com|`|RxMXfMotaa	Some short term solutions.  You might also consider putting some of your data onto a DVD or flash drive.  DVDs hold about 4 Gigs of data.  That way you can delete 4 Gigs from your hard drive without losing anything.  Sooner or later though, you are going to need a new hard drive.    You could also set up a gmail account and and sent the files as attachments to your gmail address.  This way you have an off site backup.    When you decide to get a new hard drive you can either a) just plug in the new hard drive into your mother board giving you extra storage capacity or b) get a much bigger hard drive and transfer your whole system onto the new one.|`|I7gP7KLGaa	First of all, your full of space on your computer.

Thats gotta help.|`|GDxXxh46aa	It might be time to use one of my favorite utilities: CCleaner    But first figure out how much space you have left on your C: drive.    You do this by double-clicking the "My Computer" icon which will open up a dialog box that will show you all your drives, move your mouse and hold your mouse over the C: icon for a couple seconds, and it will tell you how much free space and how large your drive is.  You probably have less than 5 or 10% space remaining, which is why you are getting a warning bubble.  Remember how much free space you have.    Go to this website http://www.filehippo.com/download_cclean... and download CCleaner  You can also go to www.ccleaner.com and follow the links to download it.    Once you download it, then install it and run it. Click the Analyze button, then click the Run button and it will clean up a lot of stuff off of your hard drive.  Everyone will tell you you should back up all your valuable files first before running this which is always a good idea. I run it about once a week with no issues.     Now go check your free space again and see if you have to go find more files to clear off.

dkpIjt5jaa	Two affirmations to start: 1) Do not reformat or use system restore to start from new as it is too harsh and you should do it only as a last resort.    2) Do not copy your documents elsewhere as this will only spread the Malware and do NOT use your Email until this is cleaned.    Now for the main part: This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (this one also hides in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    If you have a router, go directly to and do Step B  8 and then start back from the beginning.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     TRYING MBAM ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH AS YOU NEED A COMPLETE SOLUTION, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Clean browsers junk.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) Use a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ) BUT do not use AVG free, in fact you should get rid of it (Too many false positives).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|meysHMilaa	To Remove d**n Vimax in you Computer First Use  Manual steps to turn off or turn on System Restore  Steps to turn off System Restore       1.

It is a powerful piece of software with capabilities not found in any other free software product. It can be used as a simple paint program, an expert-quality photo-retouching program, an online batch-processing system, a mass production image renderer, or an image-format converter. GIMP is modular, expandable, and extensible. It is designed to be augmented with plug-ins and extensions to do just about anything. The advanced scripting interface allows everything from the simplest task to the most complex image-manipulation procedures to be easily scripted.    You not want to download, but GIMP is a pretty light download.    This is the download link http://www.download.com/GIMP/3000-2192_4...

With the extended warranties a lot of times they'll either send you a new or refurbished computer or they'll give you a credit to whatever store you bought it at.     4.  Call HP again.  Do NOT tell them you've called before.  Tell them that you would like to have restore disks sent to you.  If they tell you that you'll have to pay for them, anything under $50 is worth it, better than buying a whole new OS.      5.

8THJ9hz3aa	I'm not entirely sure that you can print on black paper. Another idea would be to use the black paper as the background and have the invitation printed on matte transparent paper and decoratively attach said paper onto the black. Otherwise you might could get a pastel or other light color printed on in raised letter ink, but keep in mind that you want your graduation invitations to be formal and sophisticated and not too overwhelming. I would try to find a local business in either your phone book or online as they are usually more accommodating to special requests than large corporations. After meeting with an employee at the printing store, you should have a better idea as to what is possible. I would call one morning and ask a few simple questions and see if someone could meet with you - and possibly set up a time to discuss.|`|32dffe7e0eba9eb2c4e6c9418ec99ba5aa	Printing on black stock requires opaque, pigment-based inks.

If it does, all you need is a good boot manager and your 10 different OS's.  If any are Linux then you'll want a Linux boot loader, like LILO or GRUB; Windows boot managers ignore Linux partitions.

I use this method to share a printer between 4 computers and it works well.    If you have a wireless printer then all your computers should be able to find and use it, but using one computer as a print server works very well - and saves having to buy a new one.|`|jf8mkGE9aa	Both computers need to be connected to each other in some way, e.g. wireless or wired through the router. You then need to need to share the printer on the computer that is connected directly to the printer. Choose an easy to remember but unique name for the shared printer.    On the computer that is not connected to it, all you need to do is add a new printer. Choose network printer and not local.    Lastly, be careful of username and password authentication for both computers. Make sure they are the same and that there is sufficient privileges to access the printer|`|Rnsgs9nuaa	Yes you can, although the method can be different from each operating system.    In Vista you would have to enable printer sharing (I think both computers) in Network and Sharing center and install the driver in the second computer if it is necessary. Then on your second computer, go to "Printers" in the "Control Panel" and click "Add a Printer", then "Add a network, wireless, or bluetooth printer". It should be able to detect the printer on the first computer. Follow the next instructions, it shouldn't be that hard.    If it doesn't detect it, you gotta find it manually. Search it in the first computer's network printer folder, which should be in your "Network" folder.    In XP I don't know exactly how, but it should be pretty much the same thing. Look at these links:  http://uis.georgetown.edu/software/docum...  http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using...    Mac, Linux, and other OS I got no clue. Sorry. =/    Oh, one other thing. If your first computer is off, your second computer CANNOT print through network printer. If your first computer is off often, you should just connect the printer with the second computer.    EDIT: Oh, and another thing. Your computers must be connected by a router of some sort, ones from  like Linksys and Netgear.

Yahoo Small Business currently uses PHP 4.3.11|`|8y4Uwo9Haa	You cannot upgrade your PHP version. I am sorry to hear that you host with Yahoo. They have the worst customer service and their apps are not up-to-date.    Your only choice now is to move your host. If you are having problem choosing a web hosting to use, I suggest you do the following:       1. Go to the webhost review sites and list down about 3 common top hosting companies.       2. Next, for each web hosting X, do a X sucks search on Google. Read some complaints and see if you may encounter the same problems like them. Some of the complaints may relate to certain groups of users only such as VPS, dedicated server users or resellers. So you may not be affected if you are not from these categories.       3. Eliminate those hostings you feel uncomfortable with, and look for the best bargain hosting for your money.    You can try Fatcow, Justhost or Webfaction. They have the latest PHP5.    Good luck.
