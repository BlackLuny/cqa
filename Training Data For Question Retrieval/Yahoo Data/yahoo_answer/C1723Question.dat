20090223032604AAhfr4S	News & Events;Current Events	Would  zero tolerance help the youth of today?	120 children who were roaming the streets after dark have been picked up by police in a national crackdown on youth crime.      Some as young as eleven were caught by the police and Child Welfare officers out 8pm, some had clearly been drinking!      Home Office figures show that during the national operation on Friday night, more than 1,200 young people were stopped by police and 103 referrals were made to alcohol awareness and parenting programmes.      Parenting programmes? Isn't it common sense that an eleven year old should NOT be out in the streets after dark, let alone drinking alcohol!    Do you think these 'parenting programmes' are really going to change the minds of these so called parents,  should there be tougher penalties for parents, or should the councils provide more activities for these youngsters,  to keep them off the streets?       http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/UK-News...

Bush raised the national debt by almost triple--Singed into law the biggest entitlement in american history to help seniors but i think was only to help big drug Companies. Had his share of stimulus money which he gave to banks. Instead of making them borrow like car companies-who had to beg fo it and promise to pay it back.--we were told they had to give the banks money or credit would freeze and people would loss jobs -then people lost there jobs anyway. Credit and people loans slowed stopped anyway. If you are going to criticize obama for something why will you not criticize anybody for that--like bush when he did it. I know he a Republican but he just did the same thing.--Spent tax payer money increased the debt-spent --bush did the same. Do you get that Republicans BUSH SPENT MONEY-INCREASED THE DEBT TO A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE. Why did you not complan then when your partys man was doing it-allow it go along with it defend bush as he was doing it-vote in faver of it With Bush as president. But, Now that we have a democrate as presendent like obama you now want to critize and reclaim the high ground as if you never left there to bigen with when it comes to stimulas money being spent. Now all sudden the national debt means somthing to you. because you say we can not aford toi ncrease it when as Bush was doing it it was ok. You republican bush lovers make me Sick. You should have been against it from the begining no matter who the president was.that was spending to much money and incresing debt. Does anybody fell the way i do. If you are going to critize then do it to everybody the same Don't have a double standard. sound off if you fel like i do--And give Obama a break he has his work cut out for him thanks to a horrible president Bush-the big spender-and Obama Just stared as president Give him a break he just started. By the way voted for obama --Never the Spender Bush.

PITTSBURGH – A jail warden said Sunday he will ask a judge to move an 11-year-old boy accused of killing his father's pregnant girlfriend from an adult lockup to a juvenile detention center because the jail cannot accommodate the boy.      Houk was eight months pregnant with the child of Brown's father and also had two daughters, ages 4 and 7, who lived together in the rural home where authorities said she was slain as she lay in bed Friday.      The boy was being held in one of four 10-by-8-foot cells in the jail's booking area, where officials check on him every 15 minutes.      The boy cannot receive visitors — except for his attorney — because doing so would require him to mingle with adult inmates. Even something as simple as letting the boy shower would require locking down a cellblock, most of which hold up to 63 inmates, Adamo said.      Elisco said jail officials couldn't even find clothes to fit the 4-foot-8-inch boy. "They put a shirt on him; he's swimming in it, and his pants are cuffed up about 10 times," he said.       http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090222/ap_o...

I was walking through the city (Chicago) at night to get home from a late showing of Milk with a friend when a homeless man tried to mug me and my friend. He was obviously high on meth or crack or something and he had a welding torch and he threatoned to burn us if we didnt give him our money. We did not have any so he got angry and used the torch on my friend. My friend marks clothes lit on fire and I ran to put it out. He had burns all over him, not too bad but obviously hurting. We are both only 16 so I freaked out, because I thought he was going to die. He was my friend since my birth and I was in a rage, so I ran towards the fleeing hobo (mugger) tackled him*Im on the football team* when he was on the floor he tried to stab me with a switch blade he took out of his pocket, I through it away and took the blow-torch which rolled to the ground when I tackled him and I unloaded it on him. His clothes started to burn and he ran away, I went back to Mark and took him to the hospital. He was ok, but we were in soo much shock from the attack that we never told the nurse that the homeless man was burned in the attack. (We didnt care, especially him he was in a lot of pain) The day after I saw on the local news that a man had found a dead homeless man in an alley two blockes from where we were assulted covered in burns. This was as of five days ago and no-one has found out yet, Mark said he would take it to his grave and I said so to, but Im thinking about coming clean what do you think? Im 16 and I never said before could I go to jail for life!!!!

A small concrete pulpit atop a hillock in this remote village of Nongnah, about 130 km west of Shillong, has been christened as 'phone booth' by the locals. For, this is the only place where they get mobile phone network.       "We have to climb up this hill and reach this 'public booth' to make and receive calls. Most of the villagers have to walk for about 20 minutes to reach here," one of them said.       There are about 3,000 residents in this nondescript village of Meghalaya's West Khasi Hills district and the nearest PCO is more than 15 km away.

An investigation into the British NHS has found, that thousands of people have become infected with HIV as a result of buying infected blood from the US. -     http://uk.news.yahoo.com/21/20090223/tuk...       In the UK , there are stringent controls for donors - many potential donors are excluded because of medical conditions or medication, so why on earth would they buy and use blood without testing it?    I agree they may import blood if they are seriously short - but it should be more rigorously tested if that is the case.    Someone - somewhere is responsible for infecting thousands of people by their actions, and should be held responsible for murder by incompetence.      Was this actually planned? - the deliberate infection of thousands, and the abnormally slow process of damage control? Thousands of people were mis-informed of the safety of the product - and died as a direct result of it.   Will be just get a "we are sorry" and that's the end of it?      Will they do the same when the HPV vaccine makes millions sterile?   "Oops - sorry"?

There were 24 dead and 177 maimed. F-4 phantoms were enroute when President Johnson stopped the rescue.   Israel's plan was to blame Egypt, and have the US retaliate against Egypt.   ----   Lockerbie ....Dec 1988   Mossad blew up Pan AM 103 and blamed it on Libya. Unfortunately, the plane was late and blew up overland, and all the evidence pointed towards Israel.   Israel's goal was to demonize the Muslims, and lay the groundwork for 9/11.    ----   Khobar Towers ...1996   Khobar Towers was bombed. It housed an F-15 unit.   Israel said it was done by Hezbollah, but US military investigators linked it to Mossad.    ---   Flight 587....2001   Mossad blows up a Fl 587 out of NY, and it crashes in Rockaway.      Bali Bomb   Mossad sets off a micro nuke on the island of Bali, killing 182.   Israel blamed the attack on muslims, and the USA invaded Iraq.      Manila.... 2003   Mossad planted a bomb on a Manila ferry, killing 103.   Israel blamed the attack on Al Qaeda.      CIA Bomb In Gaza....2003   Three CIA agents are traveling in Gaza, when a Mossad bomb exploded.   Palestinians were blamed for the attack.      Madrid Train ... 2002   Mossad killed 198 in the Madrid bomb blast.   Al Queda was blamed.      2004   Mossad bombed two airliners over Russia.   Israel claimed it was Al Qaeda.      2005   Mossad bombed London buses   The general public is so suspicious, that Israel leaders have been told not to talk publicly. The news media pushes the story it was Al Quada Pakistani bombers.      etc etc, none of this information which was proven to be Israel has ever been cross examined by American investigators, just a few things here have, the rest was by passed thanks to AIPAC.

I have always had a knack for writing and people have always encouraged me to become a writer. However, I always thought that there was not enough $ to be made in that field. I never cared about what made me happy, just the paycheck I was bringing home. Now I want happiness!!!!! I want to learn how to be a good writer, not just submit writing and hope someone likes it. How should I go about this? Can I do it online or Part-time? THANKS!!!
