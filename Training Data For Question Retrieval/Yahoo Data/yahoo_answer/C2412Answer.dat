3239658cb83aa0d1138737497004ec9aaa	La ideas vienen de la razon, y logico los grandes pensadores las sacaron de ahi despues de mucho filosofar, el de donde vino la iluminacion pues de ningun lugar en particular, cuando uno quiere dejar de estar enajenado por lo que te dicen los demas saca sus propias conclusiones de lo que sea. Las ideas no han sido dadas a la luz en su totalidad... cada cabeza es un mundo y cada quien tiene su cosmovision solo que hoy en dia la vida va deprisa y ya no se nos permite detenernos a pensar y mucho menos compartir nuestras ideas. En cuanto la ultima pregunta, claro que si, la mayoria prefiere vivir enajenado con lo que les dicen, tragarse esa basura que les dieron como "verdad" en vez de tratar de abrir los ojos.|`|c3e2f613cb41aa1d271681f6d36ace5eaa	DE UN MOMENTO DE INSPIRACION...|`|70c395efe0ace85e7356df2c20342e03aa	De su historia personal.    Yo creo que eran muy notables sus ideas, porque tenian el cuaderno en blanco en lo referente a ideas universales.    Ahora, hay ms personas que piensan de forma original, pero como existen muchas ideas anteriores, ya sus ideas llenan las pginas 1,000,000 en adelante. Esta multitud de ideas y pensamientos hacen que dichos personajes pasen un tanto inadvertidos al comn de las personas, ya sea por la falta de tiempo que tenemos para apreciarlas y por la cantidad de ideas que nos bombardean dia a da.    Considero que los "mediocres" somos los que constituimos la masa de la humanidad, pero somos tambin los que hacemos los grandes cambios, inspirados por ideas de aquellos pocos que poseen una idea original y transformadora.    Se ha dicho que "no hay nada ms poderoso, que una idea a la que le ha llegado la hora", y es que para que le llegue la hora se requiere de una masa crtica de seguidores calculada en el 75%.    As que para que una idea verdaderamente transformadora e innovadora tiene que llegar a los "mediocres" y que estos en un 75% estn de acuerdo con sus postulados bsicos.    Esto hace que la velocidad de la transformacin sea un tanto ms lento, pero como ocurre de forma constante, casi imperseptible todo el tiempo, slo somos capaces de analizarlo al paso del tiempo.|`|a7edb6e0a377c8f2b646c7327abb7356aa	Las ideas a veces son innatas es decir adquiridas en otra vida y puestas en manifiesto en otra, otras veces estn basadas en lo que se es como ser esencial y se recibe una inspiracin del mundo espiritual que nos rodea, es decir cuando la idea es buena es indudablemente que proviene de un sector espiritual elevado y que se une a m por cuestin de afinidad. Los filsofos y pensadores han sido seres elevados para su tiempo y que han sabido escuchar sa voz que les indicaba que era lo mejor para su progreso espiritual, es decir hacer el bien e infundir ideas beneficiosas para la humanidad. Constantemente hay ideas ya sea para la ciencia como para la moral lo que pasa que so no se da a conocer porque no vende pero nos damos cuenta que es as si nos podemos a observar en que situacin estbamos hace a?os y como estamos ahora aunque parece que hemos involucionado no es as, tenemos en comparacin mucho que aprender pero tamben mucho que analizar y observar, y sino comparmosnos con la era cuaternaria o con la edad media , paso a paso, todo depende de lo que trabajemos para ser mejores como espritus.|`|7861b1d1ff0fff27543dbb5f988bbeaeaa	no somos mediocres, lo que pasa es que los pensamientos de los grandes pensadores actualmente estn enfocados a la tecnologa como solucionadora de las necesidades del ser humano y no a los temas espirituales y morales como fue en otra poca.    recuerda que este mundo en el que vivimos no es para siempre, sus recursos se agotan y tenemos que mirar en direccin de las estrellas para perdurar en este viaje llamado vida.    los pensadores actuales te podra decir que son mas pragmticos que so?adores, se la pasan inventando y mejorando herramientas para perpetuar la especie dentro o fuera de este mundo.|`|dd328805c29b037879e8387f9b16e0ffaa	Yo creo que las sacaron de adentro y de afuera. Eran grandes pensadores, pero por sobre todo grandes observadores.     No s por que extra?a razn no nombraste a mi preferido, 'Scrates', pero l bas todas sus teoras en lo que vea a su alrededor, y simplemente le puso sentido comn, algo de lo que la mayora en aquellos tiempos careca.    Hoy en da existen muchos pensadores, a los cuales no voy a nombrar porque todava no los he ledo, pero ahora nos tenemos que ocupar de otras cosas. Es por eso que la filosofa cambi, pero de ninguna manera desapareci.     O acaso no lees las preguntas que hace la gente ac?  Pura filosofa (barata, pero nunca se sabe quin ser el prximo gran maestro).|`|2d803c82e24161bccc10861a2396b0f5aa	Las sacaron de sus estudios y de su creatividad.  En aquellos tiempos bastaba con algun tiempo de estudios para estar en las fronteras del conocimiento. Pero la ciencia es compleja cuanto mas se sabe mas caminos a recorrer se van abriendo. Ahora hay tanto para estudiar y saber que es mas dificil estar en la frontera de lo desconocido. As y todo ( y con grandes costos que no cualquiera puede ) hay pases que hacen investigacion cientifica y sus logros llegan : ahora se cura el cancer por ejemplo. y nadie se muere de gripe.

Viajes a la luna, a otros planetas, medicinas contra el cancer, etc.    Lo que pasa es que hoy somos millones de gentes en el mundo, hay mucha competencia para las personas brillantes, muchos tecnicos muy inteligentes, doctores que descubren virus y ya tienen la solucin para esa enfermedad.    Tanta competencia y la vida tan acelerada que debemos llevar, no permite que sobresalgan, pero de que existen, existen.    Hay grandes filsofos, poetas, chinos que han descubierto la solucin a un problema que llevaba miles de a?os sin resolver, etc.    Antes no haba tantos habitantes y menos brillantes, es por eso que esos grandes personajes pudieron sobresalir y continuar vigentes.    No somos mediocres, al contrario, hoy el nivel de estudios en Mxico ha crecido, antes era muy raro que alguien pudiera llegar a la universidad, ahora el nivel mnimo de estudios es la preparatoria y muchos, muchos jovenes son universitarios, la mujer tiene libertad de expresin y de competir por trabajos que antes estaban destinados a los hombres, cada da somos ms inteligentes y mejores.

Le septime art est une expression propose en 1919 par Ricciotto Canudo pour dsigner l'art cinmatographique.    Ricciotto Canudo tait un intellectuel italien, install en France, ami d'Apollinaire, qui fut l'un des premiers critiques de cinma. Il crivit un premier livre en 1911 qui s'intitulait ? La naissance du sixime art ?, dans lequel il considrait que le cinma ralisait la synthse des ? arts de l'espace ? (architecture, peinture et sculpture) et des ? arts du temps ? (musique et danse), soit 5 avant lui. Le cinma appara?t donc comme une synthse de tous les arts qui l'ont prcd (arts du temps et de l'espace).

Also Prosa und Musik.   Und dann muss ich wieder sagen - wenn wir da so unterschiedlicher Meinung sind in so einer Sache - kann man das wirklich beurteilen?  Ich bezweifle das.

2587ab6d7b17fb1d07c2c1365c7af266aa	Das ist eine sehr gute Frage!    An einer Seite ist der letzte Wunsch sozusagen heilig, man sollte ihm folgen. Moralischer Aspekt.    Anderseits, wenn es Kafka wirklich so wollte, warum hat er seine Werke nicht selber vernichtet gleich nach deren Verfassen? Ich denke ihn fiel diese endgltige Entscheidung zu schwer. Die Werke (die ich las) reflektieren seine innersten Gefhle und ?ngste, daher wollte er vielleicht nicht, dass sie ver?ffentlicht werden. Aber sein zweites Ich wollte sie gleichzeitig teilen, warnen.     Hier kommt der kulturelle Aspekt -- der Verwalter kann ja solche Werke der Menschheit nicht vorenthalten, oder? Daher musste er mit seinem Gewissen ins klare kommen, und ich pers?nlich halte seine Entscheidung fr richtig und bin dankbar.|`|a0b198151cdba49cc041ea6ef88d0c52aa	Ja, unbedingt, denn er war ein Meister der deutschen Sprache.|`|826e27ea3eee7baf8df4dd46b4b2d8ceaa	War nicht Max Brod der Nachlassverwalter von Franz Kafka?

El tema, o sea la corta historia la voy a llamar:   "La llegada".    No lograba concentrarme en la alegra de volver a estar en mi hogar, las caricias emotivas deslumbraban sobre m al acercarme hasta el picaporte. No rozaba la herradura cuando acord la reaccin del taxista que me devolvi a mi sitio, pero ya estaba lejos de profundizar ese instante cuando percib la presencia de un individuo que se encerraba dentro del sitio aun oscuro. Dud en girar la llave y decid que poda hacerlo algo ms silencioso. Aun motivado reaccion a recostarme de pi sobre la puerta de madera, tal vez eso absorbera el sonido al abrir. Finalmente, con absoluta dureza en mi cuerpo, fui penetrando lentamente la luz del faro nocturno de la calle Almeida en la oscura sala. Nada indicaba un movimiento cuando repentinamente cre ver una sombra que atravesaba los cermicos, cre la nostalgia fantasmal de un ser que extra?aba pero olvid repentinamente esa cuestin llenndome de fobia al pensar que se trataba de una laucha que hua de la iluminacin, estorbndole el placer de la libertar en la soledad de mi hermoso hogar.

It would be hard enough to fully explain why person A believes X even if it was a specific person and a specific belief.      So I will only attempt to give you one point of view, presented by Aristotle in a book called "Rhetoric". He thought that there are three elements in a belief "logos" (reason) "ethos" (character) and "pathos" (emotion). So holding a belief is not purely a matter of facts and reasoning, but it needs all three elements. People have different dispositions and accordingly they believe in different ways. Some are more reasonable and tend to follow logical explations easily. Some are more emotional and tend to believe things because they fear or are repulsed by their opposite,  or intuitively feel that something must be true. Beliefs can also be affected by sympathy. If you feel sympathetic toward someone, you are more likely to believe what they say.    I can't explain this as well as it could be explained. But what appeals to me about it is the idea that for a genuine belief you need all three. Reason alone may be enough to tell you that 1+1=2 but to have the kind of conviction you need to act on a belief, you need more than that. How much more depends on your disposition. Anyway, if you're interested, you can probably find better expositions of the theory by using google.|`|f0fe0137988e8531a224ad5618c47692aa	People have different reasons for what they believe.

efb313de27571e7ea53261f20f552a01aa	Hm. Ich versuchs mal.   Walter Faber hat den Spitznamen "Homo faber" von seiner ersten Liebe, Hanna Piper, bekommen. Er selbst ist ein rein rationaler Mensch, glaubt weder an Wunder noch an Zuf?lle, sondern daran, dass alles logisch, technisch und naturwissenschaftlich erkl?rbar ist. Gefhle sind ihm ein Greuel, er erkl?rt sogar Liebe rational und lebt sein Leben rein pragmatisch.   Das ?ndert sich jedoch auf einer Reise. Das Flugzeug muss in der Wste notlanden, er folgt einem Passagier in den Dschungel und findet dort seinen ehemals besten Jugendfreund Joachim erh?ngt in einer Htte. Dieser Jugendfreund ist auch gleichzeitig derjenige, der seine Jugendliebe Hanna damals geehelicht hat.   All dies erschttert Faber, aber er bleibt weiterhin rational. Schlie?lich verliebt er sich aber in ein junges M?dchen, Elisabeth. Es stellt sich heraus, dass Elisabeth Hannas und Joachims Tochter ist.   Die beiden beginnen eine Liebesaff?re. Faber wird angesteckt von Elisabeths Begeisterung fr die Welt, fr die Kunst, fr das Leben. Sein Weltbild beginnt sich zu ?ndern und wird schlie?lich v?llig erschttert, als Elisabeth t?dlich verunglckt und er von Hanna erf?hrt, dass sie nicht Joachims, sondern seine eigene Tochter war.|`|9bf9433df7e88fd6eafb4456be60c4daaa	Homo faber ist:     Homo Faber!

Falta el alma de Pink Floyd, Roger Waters, el creador del sonido tan especial de la banda, te dars cuenta si lo escuchs, que hay gran diferencia entre los temas clsicos de Floyd y lo nuevo (compuesto sin Roger Waters).  Tambin pods buscar otros DVD como Live at Pompeii, de la dcada del '70, con un sonido mucho ms experimental.  Te recomiendo el DVD In The Flesh de Roger Waters como solista, tocando temas de su carrera solista pero mayormente de Pink Floyd, con una banda que suena excelente.

If you cant spin with the brace, use an ACE bandage wrist brace, it;'s like an elastic sock. at the very least tape it up     I've also seen a chiropractor who was able to fix my wrist problems.

He just popped this little tool up and down my arm and it fixed it all.|`|3331cf16d944d6e25fdb82bfbdfed4c8aa	It's not carpal tunnel, it's just that your muscles are not developed for this activity.  Tape it up like football players tape their ankles.  Be sure to go around your thumb. This will provide support.  Wear the tape at every practice, but of course, not for performances.    The more you spin, the stronger you will become.  If you like the activity enough to do it every year, there are exercises you can do in the off season to strengthen your wrists.  Check with a personal trainer ot physical therapist - or even your family Dr. for exercises.|`|f3d2ba11c156b7323621b1f49ba578a6aa	You could tape it but there are also "brace" type things that work for practicing and wearing when you are not twirling.

This happens to me early each season and I noticed that rolling and stretching out my wrists for a few minutes before practice helps warm up my wrists and reduce pain. But if this has been a problem all season, thats not normal and you may want to contact a doctor.
AA10665012	Well, from what I've seen in my 20 years of watching people learn and 10 years of teachingpeople how to play, the hardest instrument to play is the one you like the least. I've found that when people like the sound of what they're playing, they play it more, and get better faster.     Just so that doesn't sound like a cop-out answer, I've also noticed these things -    Flute is the hardest instrument to start, especially if it is a younger or smaller child. It isn't that you have to blow so hard or do anything funky to get a sound, but the balance of how you form  you mouth and how you hold the instrument is very important. Anyone who has a hard time managing the instrument has a hard time getting the sound down.   Clarinet and Sax are both relativly easy to get started on, but as you progress, there are issues with controlling the sound. Since tone quality is so important, you could say that is the hardest part.     Brass instruments - Again, it is all a matter of how you hold your mouth and breathe. If you have a teacher that you can understand, it shouldn't be difficult. I had 2 students switch to the trombone before Christmas and they picked it up in 2 days.     Oboe and bassoon - tricky litle critters. Mostly your sound depends on your breath support and embochure (mouth shape) If you understand how to breathe properly, it isn't so hard to pick theese up.     French horn - now this may get my vote - the partials are so close together, and I saw many people struggle with this all through college. I think if you have a good sense of pitch and you have a good understanding of what your music is suppossed to sound like, you'll do better with this 'beast'    Stringed instruments without frets - If you don't have a good sense of pitch, again, this is going to be very difficult to play well. Using an electric tuner can help solve this problem though.     So, to sum it up, each instrument has its own trials and joys. The trick to finding the instrument for you is using your strenghts to overcome the technicalities of the horn. And remember - just enjoy it. That's what music is all about anyway. It's not suppossed to be the inate character battle within us that all the old fashioned teachers make it out to be. Pick something you will enjoy practicing, and you'll find you 'practice'/play all the time. You'll get really good really fast, and any one of them can be ' easy'.|`|2f68340938260121d10ebac3317ff1abaa	Easiest- Recorder.  Hardest- Piano.|`|70731046163942f02cc59bcbd25d732daa	I would say the hardest is the flute or any brass instrument (trumpet, trombone, tuba, french horn). To get different octave notes on these instruments depends on how you blow into them. I played the clarinet and thought it was the easiest. If you know how to play the piano, you could go for drums.|`|fac1c1b0480daf119d1ce16187b99d42aa	Th easiest is prolly the saxophone.... or if you dont want to be a musician percussion... (haha sry little band joke)... the hardest would probably have to be the French Horn.. 1st because it is brass and you have particals (where you can change pitches with the same fingering) and 2dn the embrouchure is very tight becuase it has a very small mouthpiece.....

9f61a68d8013c5a709711b666f7a06c4aa	Chief Obafemi Awolowo (1909-1987) was a Nigerian politician and leader, a Yoruba and native of Ikenne in Ogun State of Nigeria, who started as a regional political leader like most of his pre-independence contemporaries. He founded many organizations, including Egbe Omo Oduduwa, the Trade Unions Congress of Nigeria and the Action Group political party. He was an active journalist and trade unionist as a young man, editing The Nigerian Worker amongst other publications while also organizing the Nigerian Produce Traders Association and serving as secretary of the Nigerian Motor Transport Union. After earning a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Nigeria, he traveled to London to earn a law degree. He was the first indigenous Premier of the Western Region under Nigeria's parliamentary system, from 1952 to 1960, and was the official Leader of the Opposition in the federal parliament to the Balewa government from 1960 to 1963.    Chief Awolowo was a leader who believed that the state should channel Nigeria's resources into education and state-led infrastructure development. Controversially, and at considerable expense, he introduced free primary education for all in the Western Region, established television service, and expanded electrification projects in the region using proceeds from the highly lucrative coacoa export industry. His investments , amongst others,led the region to produce the most highly-educated populace in Nigeria at the time. Although popular in the Yoruba west of Nigeria, his left-leaning politics made him unpopular with the nation's largest political bloc - the northern, Muslim-conservative, and Hausa-dominated, Nigerian People's Congress (NPC)...............    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Obafemi_Awo...|`|JBcxCWUSaa	Obafemi Awolowo, Nigerian nationalist politician and leader of the Yoruba ethnic group.

He escaped at the end of the war to South America, but I don't know of any woman pilot flying him there.    The famous female pilot of the Nazi era was Hanna Reitsch, who was the test pilot for many of German aeroplanes, the ME 163 rocket plane, and most notably test flying a modified V1 'Doodlebug' to help engineers fix stability problems.    Her most famous exploit was to land on a street in Berlin during the final days of the Nazi regime under the noses of the Russians in a fiesler storch. She hoped that Hitler had agreed to a crackpot plan to fly the Nazi elite to Madagascar, but was annoyed to discover that the reason was for Hitler to promote her co pilot (who nearly lost a foot from flack) to head of the lufftwaffe after Goering had tried to sue for peace with the allies.  She went on to win several gliding records after the war and died of a heart attack in 1979.|`|AA10821602	Who is Doctor Mendeler?|`|ZnvSBQ3baa	Hi....

Redenzione tanto pi forte quanto pi insufficiente ad una salvazione tangibile e totale - ed in effetti agente solo all'interno delle emozioni umane.  Stoccolma 1954: Jan sbuca all'improvviso nel mezzo di un gruppo di ragazzi intenti ai loro giochi; da quel momento la vita di Krille cambier recisamente, conducendolo verso una maturit dolorosa eppure piena di amorosa consapevolezza. Bench, infatti, l'amicizia che li lega raggiunga quelle profondit impensabili nei rapporti degli adulti, fra i due rimane qualcosa di non svelato, ed  l'identit stessa di Jan.  La voce narrante  quella di Krille, resa credibile dal linguaggio non privo di ingenuit e di slancio umoristico. Quella voce ci accompagner alla scoperta della vera esistenza di Jan, la cui storia si inscrive in una realt poco frequentata in letteratura, e per ci stesso sorprende.  Un romanzo bellissimo; un libro per ragazzi che, per forza di contenuti e intensit e verit descrittive, sarebbe consigliabile ancor di pi agli adulti.    molto bello anche se alla fine non ho capito bene chi era Jan.|`|WUzGEJF7aa	molto bello "la lentezza" di kundera.....|`|d4xcCJudaa	ma....... perch non ti leggi topolino che  meglio????????????|`|5d6f932995a8c21766ad8cdb21ddb456aa	La versione di Barney di Mordecai Richler|`|6f9513343e6210449d3863dd2b41801faa	se nn l'hai ancora letto leggi il terzo d moccia " scusa ma t chiamo amore"...   se no:  -" ad un passo dal sogno" - riccardo sfondrini e luca zanforlin- parla d una storia d amore all'interno del programma televisivo "amici"...  - "occhi di tempesta"- joyce carol oates- parla d due ragazze vittime della tragedia del genitori divorziano...  - " riflettori su audrey"- t. price-  nn l'ho ancora letto x m hanno det k  bello qnd ade lo compro...  ...  buona lettura... provali sn bellix...  baci..eli..|`|406a7959d41514c6e3edcec5ca1390c1aa	"siddharta" di Hermann Hesse|`|new5GzuDaa	"Le nebbie di Avalon"|`|Cn10HMlaaa	L'ultimo di federico moccia?

aImg4VPOaa	Ich mag Richard Friedenthals Biographien. Sie sind recht umfassend und akribisch. "Goethe. Sein Leben und seine Zeit" ist als TB. im Piper Verlag erschienen. Alternativ und um vieles umfangreicher ist die auf drei B?nde ausgelegte Biographie von Nicholas Boyle "Goethe. Der Dichter in seiner Zeit", von der aber derzeit nur 2 B?nde (erh?ltlich als Insel TBs.) erschienen sind. Band 3, der von 1804 bis zum Tod geht, steht in beiden Sprachen (original = englisch) noch aus. Die Wahl einer Biographie h?ngt auch immer vom verfolgten Zweck ab. Fr ein Schulreferat k?nnte es auch ein Band aus der Reihe Rowohlts Bildmonographien tun, fr umfassende Einblicke in Leben, Denken und Werk, sowie die damaligen Zeitumst?nde sind die von mir erw?hnten B?nde besser geeignet. Hinweisen m?chte ich aber auch noch auf Goethes "Dichtung und Wahrheit", seinen autobiographischen Text, dessen Lektre zumindest immer beigezogen werden sollte. Die Biographie von Sigrid Damm "Christiane und Goethe" ist insofern speziell, indem sie ihr Hauptaugenmerk auf die Ehe Goethes mit Christiane Vulpius richtet.  Damit steht Christiane Vulpius im Mittelpunkt dieser (ansatzweisen) Doppelbiographie, zumal sich das Buch vor allem auf den Nachla? der Familie Vulpius als Quelle bezieht.|`|52d134b230ab0fe210084756bf0854b7aa	Die  Bcher eines Schriftstellers/Dichters sind die beste Biografie.

Es gibt eine Unmenge von Goethe-Biographien; Sigrid Damms Buch "Christiane und Goethe" beleuchtet anhand von Tagebchern, Briefen und Berichten sein Verh?ltnis zu seiner Frau und anderen Frauen.    Ich habe selten mit so gro?er Begeisterung ein Buch gelesen wie dieses. Spannend von Anfang bis Ende und sehr aufschlu?reich, da wir hier vor allem dem "Menschen" Goethe begegnen.    Natrlich ist seine "Dichtung und Wahrheit" nicht zu vernachl?ssigen, will man etwas ber diesen Dichter erfahren.     Immer sind es auch Briefe und Tagebcher, die uns Dichter/innen aus pers?nlicher Sicht n?her bringen.

Man kann es eben.|`|c0998070bced6de899f7cc9ebe3780eeaa	Wenn du dich an die Anweisungen h?ltst, probierst und bst, dann sicherlich. Empfehlen ist so eine Sache. Das kommt darauf an, was du malen willst, wie weit deine Techniken bereits fortgeschritten sind usw.     Geh am besten in eine Buchhandlung und bl?ttere verschiedene Bcher durch. Danach kannst du fr dich pers?nlich entscheiden, welches fr dich geeignet ist.|`|mxHib8haaa	Also ich Zeichne schon sehr lange.  Ich habe bis jetzt kein wirklich gutes Buch gefunden.  Geh mal zur VHS, da gibt es jede menge guter Kurse.  Das machten 1. mehr spa? und 2. lernst du nette Leute kennen.  Ansonsten immer Stift und Papier mitnehmen und berall Zeichnen, was dir vor die Augen kommt.|`|MlD4Bt9Baa	Ich habe mal vor einige Jahren mit so einem Buch angefangen zu malen. Es war fr den Anfang ganz gut, ich habe einige Techniken gerlernt, aber letzendlich hat es nicht wirklich was gebracht, weil bei mir nichts wirklich so aussah, wie es laut Buch sollte. Schlie?lich bin ich vom Zeichenne zum Malen bergegangen, was besser ist, weil es da nciht so schlimm ist wenn alles krumm und schief ist ;-)    Wenn du zeichnen wilst und noch keien Erfahrung hast, dann ist so ein buch hilfreich, wegen der verschiedenen Techniken. ansonsten wrde ich dir eher einen Kurs empfehlen (Volkshochschule), weil du dann einen Lehren/eine Lehrerin hast, die dich darauf aufmerksam machen kann, was du eventuell falsch machst. auf jeden Fall hilft eines: ben, ben, ben...|`|fBbXQmOFaa	Diese Lehrbcher zeigen einem Anf?nger einen Weg. Sie geben einen berblick ber Materialien die fr den Anf?nger geeignet sind. Die ersten Bilder werden nach gezeichnet und das Ergebnis ist zufriedenstellend. Nun ist aber das Buch zu Ende und dann kommt das gro?e schwarze Loch. Keine neue Anregung, was zeichne oder male ich jetzt nur? Nun ist es an der Zeit einen Kurs zu belegen. Unter fachlicher Fhrung kann man nun das bisherige im Selbststudium erlernte vertiefen und Fehler ausmerzen.|`|lEmGJ9Dxaa	naja, ich glaube die meisten zeichenbcher sind nicht besonders gut...   aber was ich dir wirklich empfehlen kann, sind die bcher von gottfried bammes... die sind echt klasse und nicht so`ne 08/15-Malanleitung... da kann man echt was lernen (z.b. anatomie des menschen etc.) dort sind viele studienbl?tter und grundlagen drin. bammes war brigens professor an der hochschule fr bildende knste in dresden und ist auch heute noch fr kunst-studenten "der" fundus was zeichnen betrifft.  also such dir doch mal ein paar bcher von ihm raus (z.b. "der nackte mensch" oder "figrliches zeichnen").  leider sind die meistens nicht so gnstig wie andere zeichenbcher, aber es lohnt sich! hol dir lieber ein buch von dem, als so`n billiges - echt, da haste mehr von. es gibt aber auch relativ preiswerte ausgaben, hab ich gesehen - vielleicht schaust du mal bei amazon.de nach...  brigens: zeichenkurse sind auch ne idee, z.b. an volkshochschulen oder schau dich doch mal nach kursen in deiner n?he um.  so, genug gequasselt...  viel spa? und erfolg weiterhin!! :-))|`|11b742ed26319ab6b52a68ccf1254f84aa	Ich bin da eher skeptisch. Zeichnen ist eine Begabung. Wer diese hat, sollte sie nutzen und der, der sie nicht hat, sollte es lassen.  Ich habe auch versucht, Kinder von Fotos zu malen, aber ich bin kl?glich gescheitert. Bcher bringen da wahrscheinlich auch nicht viel.    Meine Meinung :-)|`|bQqBTiMSaa	ohne talent geht nix|`|LXHoH21xaa	Solche Bcher k?nnen einem fr den Anfang ein wenig helfen. Besser ist es aber eigentlich, sich einfach mal alles anzusehen und von Lebendbeispielen zu lernen. Zeichne einfach alles was dir vor die Augen kommt und such dir vielleicht einen Bekannten, der schon etwas mehr Erfahrung mit Zeichnen hat. Der kann dir dann immer Tips zu deinen aktuellen Zeichnungen geben und sie auch bewerten oder Vorschl?ge machen.    Das Zeichnen k?nnen eine Talentsache ist, will ich nicht bestreiten. Menschen, die den Bleistift in der Faust abbrechen sollten sich lieber etwas anderes suchen. Aber fr alle anderen, die es noch nicht k?nnen, aber lernen wollen, hei?t das nicht, nur weil die erste Zeichnung nicht gut ist, dass sie kein Talent haben. Man muss Geduld und Ausdauer haben und ein ruhiges H?ndchen, alles andere kann man sich beibringen. Dann wird es immer  besser.
993b0f47f915247bd83445a06343370aaa	Wie bei allem ist es die Ausgewogenheit. Man braucht ein gewisses Ma? an gleichen Einstellungen und Ansichten. Das ist sozusagen die Basis, auf der eine gute Beziehung aufbauen kann. Gemeinsame Interessen sind wichtig.  Genauso wichtig sind eigene Interessen, Meinungen, Freunde,  Gedanken, weil sie oft genug das Salz in der Suppe sind.    Gegens?tze ziehen sich an, weil einen fasziniert, was man nicht genau kennt. Und Seelenverwandtschaft braucht man auch....jemanden, der einen versteht, ohne dass man vorher stundenlang erkl?ren muss.   Wer beides zusammen findet, ist ein  glcklicher Mensch.|`|c38976723ee9b37f5c90f3768d12be59aa	absolutes verstehen und keine geheimnisse sind das wichtigste. dann wird der andere fremd und ist jeden tag neu zu erforschen.|`|f409c30bf865eb485200f92b7c75accdaa	meiner Meinung nach ist es die Seelenverwandschaft - das was beim Partner anders ist, das ist natrlich interessant - aber darauf l?sst sich keine Beziehung aufbauen in der man auf lange Sicht glcklich sein kann    die Beziehung sollte nicht nur fr das irdische Sein, sondern darber hinaus Bestand haben - wenn man zu unterschiedlich ist, wird einen sp?testens der Tod trennen    wenn man sich allerdings nur zum niederen Drang der Fortpflanzung paart sind gegenseitige Gene produktiv, da das Kind sich die "St?rken" von beiden rauszieht und die "Schw?chen" besser abschw?chen kann, als bei ?hnlichen Genen|`|bccad7062c6077d60fc9ce8a29e51130aa	Ich bin der Meinung, dass die Verbundenheit am wichtigsten ist.   Die entsteht erst durch viele Gemeinsamkeiten.   Was nicht hei?t, dass man 24 Std. rund um Uhr zusammensein soll.   Es ist auch wichtig, dass jeder seinen eigen Bereich hat.|`|d9e03544880f6c3ce906def42351fdb8aa	Ich denke durchaus, dass eine gro?e - allerdings nicht absolute - Verbundenheit eine stabile Basis fr eine Beziehung ist. Wenn man etwa gemeinsam ber etwas lachen kann, ohne Worte oder vielleicht nur ein einzelnes Stichwort, und kein Au?enstehender hat die geringste Ahnung, worum es hier eigentlich geht. Das schwei?t schon zusammen. Dass ich trotzdem nichts von einer absoluten Verbundenheit halte, hat den einfachen Grund, dass ein Paar in jedem Fall aus zwei Individuen besteht und das sollte sich auch auf keinen Fall ?ndern.  Seelenverwandtschaft ist etwas tolles, ich wei? das aus Erfahrung. Aber keiner von uns wrde seine Pers?nlichkeit aufgeben, das geh?rt n?mlich ebenfalls dazu.|`|2a612225665dcc9750bbcf2909421a31aa	es ist meines erachtens die seelenverwandtschaft. was aber die fremdartigkeit nicht aussschlie?t. auch zwei sehr verschiedene menschen k?nnen diese seelenverwandtschaft haben. und sowas h?lt dann oft l?nger, als wenn man einfach verliebt ist, und alles friede, freude, eierkuchen ist....|`|eb2fe2f5c4e7a9d05b397e9161caf30daa	es braucht beides|`|c4daf98f23d678bbc5cf3083fe1b95a2aa	Am Anfang mag es ganz reizvoll sein jemanden mit Gegens?tzen zu einem zum Partner zu haben. Meiner Meinung nach wird es mit der Zeit allerdings anstrengend. Einer der Partner muss sich immer irgendwie verbiegen bzw. einen Kompromiss eingehen. Das f?ngt bei simplen Dingen wie Urlaub an, der eine ist Sonnenanbeter, der andere Snowboarder und h?rt irgendwie dann nicht mehr auf. Man muss in einer Partnerschaft nicht alles gemeinsam machen bzw. einer Meinung sein aber ein gewisse bereinstimmung sollte schon da sein.|`|XagUwWySaa	Meiner Meinung nach ist es eine Mischung aus beidem. Wenn man sich zu sehr ?hnelt, dann gibts es wenig zu entdecken bei dem anderen und es gibt auch wenig Reibungsfl?che, die man aber braucht, um sich weiter zu entwickeln. Ist man zu verschideden, fhlt man sich schnell alleine und unverstanden.      Mein Mann und ich sind und in vielen Dingen sehr ?hnlich - wir sind beide h?uslich, lesen und kochen gern, und bevorzugen einen eher geregelten Tagesablauf. Aber er ist ein Tr?umer, ich bin sehr praktisch veranlagt und w?hrend er eher introvertiert ist, gehe ich gerne auf Menschen zu. und genau diese Mischung aus Seelenverwandschaft und Fremdartigkeit ist es, was ihn fr mich so besonders macht.|`|GW4JZ6lVaa	Verbundenheit ist in einer Beziehung notwendig ...   hingegen gef?llt mir Fremdartigkeit als Voraussetzung fr eine gelungene Amour fou ...    bb|`|e852d49f5e544b0d7a3eb240c03fcb97aa	Die Mischung, oder? Totale Fremdartigkeit ist ebenso abtr?glich wie v?llige Gleichheit. Ich wollte sicher nicht mit einem geistigen Klon meiner selbst zusammensein.|`|VhnbBNxyaa	Es ist zwar interessant, wenn man einen gegens?tzlichen Menschen kennen lernt, weil sich da neue Horizonte ?ffnen. Aber ich glaube, auf Dauer w?re eine Beziehung zu widersprchlich. Da h?lt man sich doch lieber an das Bekannte, Bew?hrte, gleiche Interessen und Vorstellungen. Da ist eine Seelenverwandtschaft sinnvoller. Man versteht sich besser, ohne dass man gro?e Erkl?rungen abgeben muss, warum, wieso, weshalb...|`|91e273712bb8800f30d2cf590807e440aa	Ich denke es mir so: In der Gefhlswelt und im Benehmen ist es angenehm, einen Partner zu haben, der ?hnlich fhlt und sich verh?lt wie ich.  Aber in der Gedankenwelt ist es fruchtbar und lehrreich, einen Partner zu haben, der andere Ideen hat. Dadurch w?chst man in seinem Bewu?tsein oder lernt auch noch etwas dazu.|`|1db46cb82d818332483b2535b36c0210aa	ABSOLUTE Verbundenheit wird es nie geben - denn die reinste Liebe ist die Eigenliebe sagte schon F.

Sehr interessante Geschichte.
4499e702015fd6ad078a8c959af7e4b8aa	Beatrice ist eine frhere Jugendlieb Dantes.  Im Stck wird sie als tugendhaft idealisiert und fhrt den Protagonisten Dante.    Der Name selbst 'die Seligmachende'.  Diese wurde besonders im italienischen Sprachraum durch Dante gepr?gt.  In der Literatur kann mit Beatrice auch eine unerreichbare Geliebte metaphorisch gemeint sein.    Hoffe es hilft weiter.    jsrobotnics|`|6336b9c408931b5cd90c754980633db8aa	Das Jahr 1265 geh?rt zu den bedeutendsten Daten der europ?ischen Kulturgeschichte; denn in diesem Jahr wurde einer der gr??ten Dichter Europas, n?mlich Dante Alighieri in Florenz geboren. Die Stadt war bereits gro? und erfolgreich. Ihr wachsender Wohlstand stammte von ihren Banken und Textilunternehmen, ihr wachsender Ruhm von ihrer Kunst, Architektur und Gelehrsamkeit. Aber Florenz war auch, wie so viele Stadtstaaten des mittelalterlichen Italiens, ein Ort, der vom gewaltt?tigen m?rderischen Streit zwischen den um die Macht ringenden ehrgeizigen Familiengruppierungen zerrissen wurde. Wir wissen wenig Sicheres ber das frhe Leben Dantes, au?er dass er in einer alten Florentinischen Familie aufwuchs. Vielleicht erhielt er seine Ausbildung aus den H?nden der Franziskaner und Dominikaner, den beiden damals relativ neuen, aber dominierenden Lehrorden. Er selbst sollte einmal tief in die Stadtpolitik eintauchen, aber lange bevor er ins ?ffentliche Leben trat und lange bevor er irgend etwas von seiner Dichtung schrieb, geschah etwas, das fr seine ganze Existenz von zentraler Bedeutung sein sollte. Das Jahr 1274 nahezu genauso wichtig wie Dantes Geburtsdatum; denn in diesem Jahr, im Alter von neun Jahren, traf er ein M?dchen und verliebte sich in diese. Sie war nur ein wenig jnger als er selbst und wir kennen sie als Beatrice. Die beiden trafen sich nach dieser frhen Begegnung nur zwei- oder vielleicht dreimal und niemand wei?, was das M?dchen Beatrice Portinari ber den leidenschaftlichen jungen Mann Dante Alighieri dachte. Beatrice selbst heiratete und starb noch vor ihrem 25. Geburtstag; dennoch wurde sie zur Quelle der Inspiration seines gr??ten poetischen Werks: Der Divina Commedia, einem Werk, das allgemein als literarisches Meisterwerk angesehen wird. Es ist nicht nur ein Werk, auf das sich sp?tere Generationen von Schriftstellern mit einer Bewunderung beziehen, die Ehrfurcht gleichkommt, sondern es ist ein Werk, das geholfen hat, das Denken und die Vorstellung der ganzen westeurop?ischen Zivilisation zu formen.|`|db0bc59ec0b1a8512092ee7a49751b5baa	So weit ich mich erinnern kann, hat er das ganze Buch nur fr sie geschrieben, Dante hat diese Frau ber alles geliebt und wollte ihr scheinbar alles zeigen, von H?hle bis Paradies.|`|6129aab2fa3c23b49e1ad6332aa1be50aa	Wie schon gesagt war Beatrice Dantes Jugendliebe...er war nie wirklich mit ihr zusammen und doch konnte er sie nicht vergessen und schrieb viel ber/fr sie.  Er idealisierte Beatrice, er beschrieb sie als perfekt, wundersch?n, usw. Er stellte sie ohne Fehler dar und er angelisierte sie (er pr?gte den Begriff "donna angelo"!). er benutzte nur positive eigenschaften und benutzte viele metaphern mit z.b. Licht.  La divina commedia ist echt g?ttlich, berhaupt dantes vorstellung vom inferno!=)|`|o62Pqxinaa	Zum Verst?ndnis Beatrices in der "G?ttlichen Kom?die" kann es helfen, Dantes frhere Dichtung "Vita Nova" zu betrachten. Denn da taucht Beatrice zum ersten Mal auf: Eine junge Dame gehobener Herkunft, eher noch ein M?dchen, stilisiert zur perfekten Frau. Geistesgeschichtlich gesehen markiert ihre Figur den bergang von der (anonymen) Herrin des Minnesangs zur idealisierten Sch?nheit der Renaissance (Petrarkismus). Sie erscheint als eine Art diesseitige Muse, die den Autor durch ihre blo?e Erscheinung immer wieder zum literarischen Schaffen inspiriert.  Der Dichter entwirft in der Vita Nova das Ideal einer geistigen, letztlich unerfllbaren Liebe, die ber den Tod hinausreicht, denn die junge Beatrice stirbt im Verlauf der Handlung. So kann sie der Dichter in der sp?ter entstandenen Commedia im Jenseits wiedertreffen.  Bemerkenswert ist, dass in der Vita Nova sozusagen nur auf die Entfernung geschmachtet wird. Obwohl Dante und Beatrice im Verlauf der Handlung keine drei Worte wechseln und er sie meist nur aus der Entfernung sieht, durchlebt er alle H?hen und Tiefen einer bermenschlich starken Liebe.    Dantes Beatrice geht zwar aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach auf eine reale Person zurck. Ihre starke Stilisierung verbietet es allerdings, seine Werke biographisch zu verstehen. Beatrice ist bei Dante ein mehr oder weniger abstraktes Konzept, keine reale Person.    In der "G?ttlichen Kom?die" durchwandert der Ich-Erz?hler das Jenseits. Durch H?lle und Fegefeuer fhrt ihn der r?mische Dichter Vergil. Da dieser ein Heide war, bleibt ihm der Zugang zum Paradies versperrt. Hier bernimmt die verstorbene Beatrice die Fhrung. Sie erscheint noch st?rker als in der Vita Nova als die Verk?rperung des reinen Guten, des Prinzips Liebe, hier nun freilich endgltig in einem religi?s berh?hten, transzendentalen Sinn.  Soviel zu Bedeutung und Symbolik. Die Personenbeschreibung ersch?pft sich in Minnesang-typischen Hyperbeln -- natrlich ist Beatrice die Sch?nheit und Tugendhaftigkeit in Person --, und wie in mittelalterlicher (Liebes-)Dichtung blich, gibt es weder in der Vita Nova noch in der Commedia eine Charakterisierung im heutigen Sinne.    Edit: Ob Dantes Beatrice tats?chlich Beatrice Portinari sein k?nnte, darber streiten die Gelehrten. Leider ist mein Studium zu lange her, dass ich die Details noch zusammen bek?me, aber da gibt es erstens irgendwelche Unstimmigkeiten mit den Lebensdaten und zweitens andere Beatricen, die als reale Wurzel der literarischen Beatrice in Frage kommen.

Ein Buch wird in den Himmel gelobt, und jeder berschl?gt sich f?rmlich - dann liest man es selbst und kriegt einen Kotzkrampf.

Es sei denn, Talent zum Schreiben wrde haupts?chlich durch hohe Verkaufszahlen nachgewiesen.  Insofern bliebe die Literaturkritik, um zumindest Auskunft ber die grunds?tzliche Qualit?t deiner Werke zu geben - eine vernichtende Kritik bedeutet ja nicht unbedingt ein schlechtes Buch, sondern vielmehr, das der/die jeweilige Kritiker/-in erst einmal nicht um die Auseinandersetzung damit herumkam. (Kann verschiedene Grnde haben, ist aber kein schlechtes Zeichen.)  Nehmen wir doch mal den guten Konsalik. Schreibt sein Leben lang ein Buch pro Woche. Literarischer Wert? Zweifelhaft bis nicht nachweisbar. Auflagen- und Leserzahl? Enorm. Hatte der Talent? Meine Antwort ist (trotz meiner Worte weiter oben) ja, weil speziell an Konsaliks ungeheurem quantitaiven Output deutlich wird, dass Schreiben ihm alles andere als schwer gefallen sein muss. Der hat nicht stundenlang ber Motive, Storylines, Konstruktion, Charakterzeichnung usw. nachgedacht, sondern einfach losgeschrieben, immer weiter, von einem Buch ins n?chste. Man k?nnte sagen, er konnte sich nicht gegen das Schreiben wehren. Und das wiederum scheint mir eine Eigenschaft zu sein, die Konsalik auch mit Nobelpreistr?gern der Literatur teilt - im Schreiben einer pers?nlichen Notwendigkeit nachzukommen - was (meiner bescheidenen Ansicht nach) die Grundlage eines sich in welcher Weise auch immer entfaltenden Talents sein sollte.

Or, what if one of your more timid characters was faced with a tough decision like having to leave their abusive partner for the sake of their kids? What if one of your more stronger characters were faced with something they hadn't had to deal with before like a death of a mate or parent.  They're usually strong in the midst of chaos, but this is different.  Are they able to allow themselves to be open up emotionally or do they push it all in, creating inner turmoil that turns their worlds upside down.     Pick up a newspaper and read some stories about different tragedies or pressing world events like terrorism, reprisal, poverty, etc. and throw a few of your characters in it and see how their different personalities affect their outlook and handling of the particular problem.    Since everything's about terrorism nowadays, what would happen if one of your weaker characters had to dig within themselves to find the strength to deal with a catastrophe similiar to 9/11?  Could they do it? Make them do it.      It's in these changes in what your characters would normally do that creates the personal growth that readers will find inspiring.    Good luck.|`|KeevlZnTaa	There are books that give prompt for stories. You could try website prompts.

I say why hollywood? I don't know why you would be asking if you didn't live in India or weren't going there soon, so I simply ask, if you want to get to Hollywood in particular, you're going to have to move to the US anyway so why still do it through India? Go now. Or, if you just want to get a kickstart in your acting career, why not try Bollywood? It's not like it's hard to get through to them when you're in India!

cR8UZdi1aa	No. It would probably become brittle & fall apart (after some time) or melt if it's just hot enough.     It's probably an oil based clay made for professional clay sculptors. You would defeat the purpose by trying to bake it. If you want an oven baking clay, get "Sculpy" at any craft store & follow the directions.    Baking the never hardening clay would also create some pretty nasty fumes that you wont want to breath in or caked onto your oven. Warming up this kind of clay in an oven is something sculptors like to do to soften it so it's more pliable to work with, but that's only to warm it, not bake it.|`|xopIi2Vfaa	it would most likely melt. Never hardening clay is usually oil based clay. They melt when they get hot. If it says never hardens on the package, they actually mean it....

EFjrJmdXaa	Just take deep breathes and start meditating while humming. Not only will that be funny but it will be relaxing. Sure, your friends may laugh but just laugh with them. It really is silly when we go crazy. I think what you mean is when people learn to block out the people around them to go on doing what ever it is they are doing. Right? Well, I think some people are naturally just good at not paying attention to what others are doing and some people are good at paying attention to others. Neither person is better than the other. The people who are naturally sound of mind offer those with extremely active minds some peace, while the extremely active minds offer the naturally sound of mind some insight. If you are the type of person who feels overwhelmed around others you disagree with I would say to just go somewhere else and not be around them. Of course be polite and explain to them why you have to, don't be rude because then it is just a reflection of your own inability to handle a situation. Whether or not another person is annoying is highly subjective and the way you behave toward them just reveals weaknesses in your own nature. There is nothing wrong with having weaknesses, everyone does, but it is best to avoid putting yourself in those situations.    A lot of sensitive people (having extra sensory/highly active minds) can be under a lot of pressure due to their sensitivity. For people like this I would say it is best to surround yourself with like minds and peaceful surroundings. Meditation is also good. Concentrate on relaxation and good feelings. Don't feel funny doing it because of course it won't work. Just let go and let the stress breathe away. It does take practice and understanding though so it may not work for you. Just surround yourself with peaceful surroundings.|`|wvgXjB3Vaa	just think of how you want the world to be. imagine it. picture it. then when you have the pictures you lay down on something comfortable and then close your eyes. that is how i get into my "own little world"|`|AA11503678	my cat and fishes help and if I feel realy bad praying and listening to Quran recovers my wounds.|`|zxhppf3Caa	Sleep.

3rEyyZftaa	What is art?Artsatire.com claims to have come up with the definitive answer...|`|vgbXF1Zfaa	a way for people to express themselves in watever way they like|`|JFKPqQV1aa	Art is something that has no purpose other than art itself, however these forms can be integrated into practical venues, eg. architecture.
1bRRODd2aa	There are many "Trolls" out there who "thumbs down" all but their own answer, in the mistaken belief that this might influence the selection of "best answer".  It is also a means of moving one's own answer to the top of the list as all other's when the individual views that question are hidden.    There are also those out there who are so convinced of their own knowledge and the belief that everyone else is wrong.    Another reason is there are thousands of PC radicals out there who are convinced that there is only one way of thinking (theirs) that anyone else's opinions are offensive to them.    The reasons are endless and totally pointless.|`|7aK81hsbaa	don't worry, hon, whatever u say someone will disagree. their prob, not yours. :)    luv your hair!  :)|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	It's happening a lot now ,I gave a simple Answer to a Question and got a Violation. Why|`|I3CNklLKaa	I know - it's infuriating isn't it?    The ones that really get on my nerves are when ladies ask if you like the name they have lined up for their unborn child. They pick a name like "fish-face" or something equally ludicrous and you politely suggest that it might not be entirely the best choice and you get a thumbs down and called a "w@nker" (I jest not).|`|AA12078704	Because the internet is full of weirdos who feel significant just because they have the power to give a thumb-down to some perfectly fine answer, with which they would never have been able to come up for themselves?|`|ANcCxdEfaa	I've come across answers that were informative but did not *answer* the question as asked.  If the questions were asked in person and you had the opportunity to ask the person to clarify, it may not be so bad.  But since Yahoo Answers has no such option to quickly follow up with an answer and ask for clarifications, I've often "thumbed them down" as you've put it.    Not all downed thumbs should be looked at as being negative but when you notice them, try and honestly answer the question "Does it really have anything to do with the question being asked?"|`|qYlkAyiJaa	I will sometimes give an answer a thumbs down if it has crucial information in it that is incorrect, especially something really important (like health-related), no matter how nice they said it.  If they're wrong it's not a good answer and that's the only way I can help to indicate that. I hope people would do the same for answers to questions I ask (and of course my answers if they're wrong).  Opinions I don't usually thumb-down, unless they're blatantly mean.  I think way fewer people would thumbs-down if we could leave comments on other people's answers.  That would help a lot.  I hope I get thumbs-downed for this. lol|`|9yZ4rYa6aa	Truthful answer, people are dicks. Sometimes someone makes a good honest point or percieves a situation in such a way and the suggestion is so taboo it's discredited - also jealousy is a key factor in crap like that. I'm gonna find your answer and give it a thumbs up because this also annoys me.|`|93d1272e676f48f0eee8d8378c0b91f2aa	i don't worry about thumbs up or down, each to their own i say.. if it makes them happy to give me a thumbs down, glad i could help, if it makes them happy to give thumbs up,.that makes me happier but it's not the end of the world either way, just keep smiling! :)|`|ampkZtrXaa	Good polite answers = thumbs down, bad rude answers = kicked out.

L2cg59QQaa	http://www.amazon.co.uk/Ministry-Sound-U...    Above is the link to the one i have. I'm not sure about the others, but i can tell you about this one. It is quite high-speed. You will probably have to increase th eamount you are able to do gradually. It has a warm-up section, then i think maybe a couple of dance sections. It also has a bums and tums section. Then a cool down. If you check on that link, just click on the customer reviews as that can be helpful to let you know what each of them include. There is a more up to date one too, i think from 2008. If you just search 'Ministry of Sound Pump it up' then they should all come up. I do recomend it though as its more fun to dance to music than it is to just do a workout.  Good Luck. x|`|5ZK9VGPCaa	It really depends on how good you are at picking up dance moves and following choreography. If you are not good at this, I would recommend that you get "Pump it Up: Aeroburn". I bought this last week and have done it 4 times already. It really gets you sweating and burning pounds and the music is really good and gets you hyper. The actual work out is less dancy and more aerobics style (like it's name). It took me two go's to pick up the moves. Alot of jumping around, and you REALLY feel your butt and backs of your thighs working. I also have the "MoS: Pump it Up" (2007) which is really good for dancing, but you have to be able to follow the moves, otherwise it's too difficult (the dance moves are fun though and sexy). I like both, but as I said if you are just looking to burn fat and don't want anything too complicated, go for Aeroburn. Have fun.

JPlVt9xYaa	It's actually fun. I have watched this old guy come up over the years and turn out to be a very wonderful fellow. It has been a slow process and I do recognize myself, but I wouldn't recognize me if I looked back twenty or so years.    I feel great, I love life, I enjoy everything I do and I have never had a worry, I have never had a problem, I have done my best, gotten a great education, raised a wonderful and successful family and when I look in the mirror, I can say, "glad to know you".    Two of my children are professors, one is the CEO of one of the biggest corporations in the world and the little one, is the editor in chief of all my books.    I have paid my dues, I wouldn't change a thing and I certainly wouldn't want to go back in time. I hope this helps.|`|KifasiMraa	considering you look at yourself everyday, any changes to your body happen so gradually, that you would never "not recognize" yourself all of a sudden, unless you experienced something that changed your face in an instant, like a fire or accident etc.      And if that were the case, I am sure you wold experience some depression over the matter, but if you have a strong sense of self, then hopefully you believe that you are the same on the inside no matter what you look like on the outside and that would keep you from being distraught over your appearance.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G Not good. When I see a picture of me and my wife together, I wonder who that old guy next to her is.
EFjrJmdXaa	You could just be getting burnt out. Do you exercise normally and eat healthy? If not and you work a lot then you can be burnt out. If not I would say start eating healthy and working out. Honestly when I was younger I had a lot more energy. I think when we are young we just naturally have an abundance of energy and curiosity. As we get older chances are some things become redundant and the mystery behind a lot of things is revealed and seems a lot less exciting as we thought. Also I think as we get older we tend to become more controlled individuals. When we are young we have less principles and just randomly run around with no boundaries due to no real principles. Maybe this has to do something with it? Maybe it is totally something different in your situation. Depression is a possibility. Have you lost something special to you lately? Have you accumulated a lot of bad experiences? Do you feel like you have lost hope because due to the fact that "all guys are the same"? They aren't trust me! Just need to look in different places if that is the problem. Then again maybe you are just burnt out and need a rest. Working continuously does have a toll on the body!!|`|qYlkAyiJaa	From my experiences, I can't get motivated to get things done unless there is a clear goal, and I can't have a clear goal without inspiration, and sometimes it takes some effort to find that-- to remember why it is I have done what I have done and why I am doing what I am doing.      Think about what it is you want. What else do you want out of this life?  Make a list and then list some ways to achieve these things if you need to (you may not need to, but it helps me to see it on paper sometimes). Read a little about someone in your field who has been very successful and determined, reconnect with yourself.  Maybe your interests and skills have evolved and your job hasn't.|`|a61m9ASGaa	you are in a slump, which may turn to be your mid-life crisis. but its okay, youll get through it!!!!!!|`|PLAin7abaa	have some sex and you'll be alright|`|fSX8Ie7caa	alot of times people just need some encouragement (and a little forcing). instead of doing stuff by yourself find a group to do things with|`|sJHCOgjfaa	well maybe you got your eye cort on something else im only 14 but i think if u really want to do something you would do it so theres obviously someone or something holding you back. maybe plan it ahead with some friends to do it. i find havin a girly day with m8 really gets your energy up. xx|`|c0qy2xM4aa	mid-life crisis, just do stuff that intrigues you|`|jhH8Hdqzaa	so you dont have ambitions, current challeges? things to achieve?  nothing? probably it's time to have babies    an extreme challenge to make them grow up in a good manner. good luck =)|`|n6deQ4n4aa	i am going to be blunt...YOU'RE BURNED OUT.

Think about how you are socializing? Are you hanging around with people who have positive energy?    Think about how you talk to yourself? Is your self-talk upbeat and energetic?    Are you sleeping enough? Are you getting the chance to do what you love and are good at every day?    You may need to refocus at this time. Yes, turning 30 might be part of it - but that's much more psychological than physical.    If, after everything else, you still can't find any reason for your lack of energy, check in with your doctor and get some blood tests done. There could be a whole host of medical reasons for your lack of gumption.|`|09zVUMBRaa	If you find the answer to this will you email it to me?  I'm experiencing something similar.  I don't have the energy...    You may have an iron deficiency.|`|XvO4iLk0aa	G  Well, if I were just turning thirty, I would be paranoid about the loss of youth. It would, however, just be paranoia.   The budding of maturity causes reflection, and since your   age is a time when physiology and psychology don't change very quickly, a period of evaluation could be te best for now.

KuPshIjcaa	Yeah some people I know are amazing dancers and they've never practiced.    But yeah I think it's a lil of both, even if your the greatest dancer in the world you'll need help with some steps..    No it really isn't any comparison to a mirror, if you have a digital camera, webcamera, video camera or whatnot, take a video of yourself and when you get to the computer you'll see yourself dancing, and then you can track what the moves are suppose to be and make sure you don't totally mess up.    good luck!|`|aSuLnvoSaa	most definetly.      you don't have to be a "born dancer" to be succesful, though. just practice practice practice and you will succeed.      but born dancers have a way easier time with it and look a tad more natural on stage|`|yyj5JvBGaa	i'd say both  some ppl already have the moves and the ability to dance but they need practicing to improve and learn new moves and stuff|`|5wvQEohpaa	Everyone can dance. And everyone has to practice.   Some people are just born with the talent. Not to brag, but I have it. I am on the Competition Team Level 2 (still young). We have won many awards.   But, there are some people who try and practice and they are ok. But by practicing, you get better and better. I know you probably don't like my saying "Practice!", but it's true.   It is better to use a mirror because you can actually see yourself. It is also good to record yourself because sometimes, you don't notice mistakes while dancing. And for tap, it is good to record and then listen to your sounds. You may not hear your sounds while dancing.|`|7rQDuCDlaa	Yes - you can see it in some of the best dancers who have a dancing pedigree, like the Strallens whose parents met in Cats. They have the natural ability in suitable body types inherited from their parents, but there's also a lot of practice and education there. Being a born dancer won't make you the best dancer you can be without training.    Mirror or someone to correct you - as you say, a shadow isn't going to help you very much.|`|a2OfsoLuaa	Yup some people are born with talent and some people need to practice.  Like some people are born with drawing skills and others music (definitely not me)  so yes its both and it helps a lot to practice in front of the mirror than you can see your position and the slightest things. :D|`|QzB0Osa2aa	its all about good practice...although some people are very talented.    no you dont have to use a mirror. michael jackson never uses a mirror when he choreographs for himself because it makes him too self concious. however, mirrors are useful for spotting posture mistakes etc.     xx
S6tRZlKAaa	Ooh I know this one! hehe    In short..ish!:    MATHS:  Well, art is incorporated into things which also include math, the most obvious being architecture. Also, often times artists will incorporate geometric, mathematical patterns or similar, which obviously involve math.    LITERATURE:  Literature can inspire art, or vice versa. Both are affected by the times, personal experiences, etc. of the creator.    SCIENCE:  Here you might want to look up 'Renaissance Technology', involving people such as Taccola and Da Vinci, which essentially combines art and science for it's research.  Art can go hand-in-hand with Science, because it can explore areas science does not, whilst still demonstrating or applying scientific theories.    HISTORY:  History can be taught, recorded and discovered by Art. We have a much better idea of life and times of the past through art. Religion is an area of history which is also GREATLY associated with art. Art itself is a concept as old as time, so obviously it has been used in so many ways for...ever.

No, I do not think that conclusion is the place where a person got tired of thinking.

48SKEteeaa	Ok, let's first deal with some of the rubbish from earlier answers.  1. The RMS Lusitania was a British ship flying a British flag. The Germans had said much earlier that any ships flying a British flag were fair game. There were only 128 Americans on-board out of about 1600. The ship was sunk in 1915. USA entered the war in 1917.  2. The Lusitania sinking was not the main reason the USA joined the war but was simply ONE of the reasons. The USA demanded the Germans stop sinking passenger ships. The Germans stopped (for a while)  3. The USA pursued a policy of isolationism (surprise, surprise) and wanted to keep out of the war.  4. Pearl Harbour was in WW2 not WW1.  5. There were no Nazis in WW1.    Why did the U.S. enter WWI?  1. It was starting to look like Germany was going to be defeated. The USA wanted to be part of the post war carve up and wanted to be there for their share of the pie.  2. The USA was supplying war materials to the allies. They could not do this and be "neutral" as well. In fact the USA was breaking international law by supplying the allies.  3. German agents committed two acts of sabotage on war materials in the USA destined for the trenches of Europe.  4. American public opinion was slowly turning against Germany and the public believed the USA should help France and Britain.  5. The American military was very keen to have a go at the "Hun".  6. The Zimmermann Telegram and the sinking of seven American merchant ships.  7. Britain softly manipulated the USA into joining the war (refer "6"). History can't really blame them.|`|QsontYoqaa	the assaination of some germen guy|`|vxqvnc0qaa	"Attacks on Pearl Harbor".

Germany also sent a message to Mexico, saying that if Mexico declared war on the USA, Germany would help Mexico regain Texas, New Mexico and California which had been lost during the Mexican-American war. That was called the Zimmerman Telegram.|`|EBrgRBT3aa	 Why the United States Entered World War I    The US entered the war for a variety of reasons. Here are some summaries of explanations given by WikiAnswers Contributors.    Submarine Warfare and the Lusitania        * There were unauthorized German submarines along the US East coast. Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare in the spring of 1917 provided the final straw for US politicians, and America declared war.         * The first and foremost answer would be the sinking of the Lusitania, an British cruise/transport ship, bound for Britain from New York. The German U-boat ring sought to sink all supply ships headed for Britain in order to starve the island. It sank the Lusitania as part of its efforts. 1195 people died, including 128 Americans.         * The Lusitania's sinking was the biggest influence on the American decision to enter the war. German submarine warfare (the Lusitania is included in this) sunk many ships over several years.         * Had it not been for the Lusitania, the US would have stayed out of the War.     Economics    Some say the "bankers" were involved.        * The U.S. had huge economic investments with the British and French. If they were to lose, then they would not be able to pay the U.S. debt back (amounting to about two billion dollars while Germany only borrowed a mere 27 million).         * If Allies could not pay back all the loans made to them by the American bankers, the US's economy could collapse.         * France and England were financing their war with US loans. In addition, they were buying massive amounts of arms from the US on credit. The US wanted to make sure that it got paid back. Germany also purchased arms, but in a much more limited fashion.     Politics        * Propaganda from both sides influenced the American decision.         * Woodrow Wilson did not want to go to war but when Teddy Roosevelt decided to run for another term, Wilson felt threatened and announced that there would be a preparedness program and possibly that the country would go to war.         * By entering the war, the US got to flex its muscles on the world stage and establish itself as a world power.         * After both sides of the Mexican civil war demanded that our troops leave and public opinion badly swayed against US intervention in Mexico, Wilson had no choice but to withdraw. By having the threat of Germany helping Mexico fight back against him, Wilson knew he had to take action. He couldn't go back into Mexico because the American people would not allow it. He really had no beef with Germany, he just wanted to save face before Mexico could fight back.     Ideology        * President Wilson wanted to make the world safe for democracy ("Wilson's War Address to Congress").         * It was partly for idealistic reasons (propaganda was not seen as an evil until after the Great War). The occupation of Belgium and the sinking of the Lusitania changed a lot people's minds in the US about Germany.         * There was more to it than just the submarine warfare and the sinking of the Lusitania although those were the formal and legalistic reasons for declaring war. I think that over time a moral sense had developed that Britain and France were fighting the good fight for freedom against a genuine evil. If that sense had not existed I think the US would have let the Lusitania pass. As it was, it was nearly two years after she was sunk that we finally did declare war.     Zimmerman Telegram    Other points influenced entrance to the war, but the Zimmerman Telegram (sometimes called the "Zimmerman note" or "Zimmerman telegraph") finally pushed the US to war. The Zimmerman Telegram was sent from the German foreign secretary to the German Ambassador to Mexico. It stated the following:        * On the first of February, 1917, submarine warfare will be reinstated unrestrictively.         * The US has to stay neutral.         * Germany proposes an alliance with Mexico on the following basis: If the US goes to war, Mexico must fight on the home front in an financially supported alliance with Germany; If Mexico agrees to fight, they will reconquer New Mexico, Texas and Arizona.     The telegraph was intercepted by British Intelligence and transmitted to the American government by the Brits.    This infuriated Americans. It was the same sort of alliance that plunged Europe into war.    Other WikiAnswers Contributors agree:        * The clincher was "discovery" of the Zimmerman Telegram (it was de-coded by the British and forwarded to US diplomats; with obvious self-interest on the part of the Brits).     |`|liGnB94taa	We're talking WWI here, not WWII. The Germans sank the Luscitania. I'm sure I spelled that wrong. The Germans were not supposed to sink it. It was not a military boat, and 3 Americans died.   Pearl Harbor got the US involved in WWII.  The assassination of Francois Ferdinand, an archduke,and his wife, by Princip Gavrilo, a Serbian nationalist was why the war started. It also started because of the many alliances that were formed before it. When one country declared war, all of it's allies had to too.|`|1jAZfpODaa	Sorry I thought you said WWII, not WWI. Anyway.  The assassination of the Archduke of Austria-Hungary Franz Ferdinand set off the powder keg in the Balkans. The U.S. did not join the war until 1917 due to increasing German aggression, which included the sinking of passenger ships and American merchant ships by German U-boats. Woodrow Wilson tried to negotiate terms with Germany but after British blockades of the North Sea which basically cut all U.S. trade to Germany all financial ties were abandoned. The Allies owed millions of dollars of money to the U.S. for the skyrocketing shipments of war goods. We became so financially tied to the Allied countries, especially France and England, that many economists pushed to enter the war. Many Americans felt a duty to protect these countries, for they had been or allies for years.|`|0WfR8gMgaa	The staggering ignorance of the previous answers is a blemish on our current educational system. Pearl Harbor was WWII.    The US entered WWI pretty much against popular opinion. But what allowed president Wilson to go ahead was unrestricted submarine warfare by the Germans which sunk hundreds of thousands of tonnes of US merchant ships as well as the passenger liner Lusitania.     And some think that the US just was itching to kick some butt. |`|AA10399803	The immediate reason that the United States entered World War II was the the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. However, President Roosevelt had been looking for a way for the United States to enter the war on the side of the UK and the USSR, and Japan's attack provided a good reason for entering the war.

f7XV5UDWaa	There are a few schools that teach mural painting, usually as part of a decorative art curriculum.  However, most muralists learned to paint in a more traditional format, such as oil paint on canvas or watercolor paint on paper.  Then, the knowledge they have in color mixing, composition, and so on can be used in other art forms such as murals.  After all, a mural is just an oversized artwork painted on a wall!    I did murals while I was a graphic designer working in advertising.  Sometimes, after I designed a logo or sign for a customer, they would ask me to paint a sign or mural that would compliment the new logo or sign.  Because I never refused a paying job, I would do the murals.  Besides, they are a lot of fun!  So, I think some artists who are not full time mural painters also do some murals now and then.

i5OVORXgaa	For a beginner, Photoshop Elements 7.0 is a good choice. It has the basics and you can get it for under $100. There's a trial version available on this website if you want to check it out first.  http://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photosh...    There's also Photoshop CS4, but that is a lot more expensive and more complicated to use... better for the advanced.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	The best costs $1000 unless you are a student ... they you can get it in the student store for $199.  That is Photoshop CS4 Extended.    Adobe has lesser Photoshop programs, Elements (under $90) and Photoshop CS4 (under $700) ... what they all have in common, is the fundamentals for making modifications of image files.    You do not need any photo program to make your images more vibrant or exude colour ... you just have to look for subjects that have a lot of colour and using lighting and proper exposure, capture it in your camera.  If you do not have at least an entry level DSLR, you may be wasting your money buying a $700 plus program when DSLR's with lenses start at less than $450.     You can download many different trial programs, but unless you have some basic knowledge using them, the 30 days is  not long enough for you to learn how to use them with any efficiency.      I would suggest you look into Adobes Lightroom before spending the big bux on Photoshop CS4.  It has all the tools a photographer needs and none of those reserved for pre-press and post production guru's    http://www.adobe.com/uk/downloads/|`|AA12339318	The best one to buy depends on what you want to do with it.  If most of your use will be to touch up photos, then you don't need to spend several hundred dollars on a full version Photoshop when the $100 Photoshop Elements will do that and a lot more.    Buying the full version to do what you plan to do is much like spending a few hundred thousand dollars on an expensive sports car and only using to go fetch groceries.|`|UnVkjwNpaa	I use Lightroom most

Also, the actual process is really time consuming.  In short, don't break your reeds.|`|v5kii54Jaa	Go to charlesdoublereed.com. They're reliable and reasonably priced. You'll need a mandrel, reamer, thread, and cane and staples of course, among other things. The basic process is to first create a blank, wrap it, and then scrape it. You want to create a 'heart', it will be damn near impossible to get it all right without taking lessons with a private instructor who can show you how to do these things. It will take you a few months to be able to play on your own reeds comfortably. If you're having a hard time finding a trusted instructor, go to your local symphony's website, like for instance I live in Maine so I would go to the Portland Symphony Orchestra. Look under the musicians section and find those that are listed as playing oboe, they're almost guaranteed to give private lessons.       hope it helped and good luck with the reed making :)
Czv8jEsDaa	During the Greek Hellenistic period all the sculptures show great emotion. They aren't stiff as previous one. Compare them to the Egyptian their sculpture they are like in a box and the hellenstic have twist and emotion and more realistic.
n7hezV5aaa	The history of ancient Greek art mainly in the form of sculpture is composed of roughly three periods: the Archaic, the Classical, and the Hellenistic. The Archaic is rather stiff and primitive; the Classical becomes more sophisticated and realistic; and the Hellenistic becomes flowery and highly decorative.    During the Archaic period, Greek artists try to achieve realistic likeness in picturing the human figure, and the statues are a far cry from the extremely abstract figures of the geometric style which preceded. In fact, the statues show the influence of Egyptian art in its stiffness, gracefulness, and idealization. But the artists weren't quite comfortable with achieving naturalism yet. The archaic smile, outstretched palm, clenched fist, and wooden posture of a striding figure are all stylistic devices that compensate for an inability to portray a figure in realistic full action during this emerging stage of naturalism.    The Classical period of Ancient Greece produced some of the most exquisite sculptures the world has ever seen. The art of the Classical Greek style is characterized by a joyous freedom of movement and freedom of expression. It celebrates mankind as an independent entity. Artists hold their aesthetic standards to a quest for ideal beauty; this leads to their depicting the human figure in a naturalistic manner because it is the first time in human history that the human body is studied for its aesthetic values. They replace the stiffness of the human figure from the Archaic period with a free-flowing form more true to life. The most significant change is the counterbalance, or s-curve, of the body, known as controposto. One foot comes forward so that one leg is relaxed and the other bears the weight of the body; the pose is much more naturalistic.    The Hellenistic period occurred from the third to the first centuries B.C. in the times that spring up after Alexander the Great's conquests. This is a great time of prosperity that encourages the production of art of a more secular nature. A new reality emerges in Greek sculpture. Instead of depicting ideals such as logic and suppressed emotion or perfect beauty, the artists explore reality.|`|RKOzbNLdaa	Because the people how sculpted them were amazing artist and very observant.|`|239f50ccc541d3e2cfbd132cf738cf95aa	Because the people they used for models looked so real.

g8kIjpwSaa	Milk jugs are plastic and flexible, which means any paint is gonna have a hard time sticking to it and not flaking off.    But, to give you the best result that will last the longest, do this.    ? Sand the milk jug lightly with some fine sand paper until it's rough.  ? Put two coats of white "primer" on it.  ? Let dry and use spray paint to give it the color you want    ** Gloss spray paint has more elasticity than flat spray paint. You're less likely to have problems if you use that.

f4Nn0W1xaa	Why limit yourself? Why not write a book about mermaids being persecuted by the Nazis? You could have the mermaid Resistance in the Coral Ghetto!  Or, hey, I know! Have Nazi mermaids persecuting fish! That's an untold story for sure!|`|wUaMEwSsaa	MERMAID|`|N0A8mCuzaa	Both, I think that The Nazi would be interesting seeing that it is fiction yet based off true experiences.|`|i5L49GFOaa	I, personally, enjoy Holocaust books very well. I think it is a good idea for you to make yourself a character and go back in time to 1940's. You should make it where you hide and get found but don't make it to much like Anne Frank.|`|Xkas9BG2aa	I read Sue Monk Kidd's "The Secret Life of Bees" and enjoyed it so much that I want to read her book called....The Mermaid Chair...not sure how much about mermaid(s) this book is other than having mermaid in the title.  I can't think of another mermaid book out there except for a Disney film...so because it's not common, that might be a good thing to write about.    The Nazi persecution theme is also interesting.  I have a bunch of library books waiting to be read at home and one is called...Those Who Save Us by Jenna Blum...it's mixed with fact and fiction...looking forward to it.    If you can do it...write both books...read other authors with the same theme and then write your own writings.  Good Luck.

Step2: Outline the raw shapes within the dragon by sketching circles and ovals to represent appendages. Use these shapes as appropriate to depict the head, neck, torso, tail, wings, claws, as well as upper and lower arms and legs.    Step3: Change the torso shape to one with a powerful upper body that narrows to a smaller waist. In the same fashion, alter each oval one by one to better define the body part it represents. Use real life examples such as crocodiles (head and torso), snakes (tail), horses (neck), body builders (arms and legs) and bats (wings) to create appropriate musculature.    Step4: Flesh in details such as scales, claws and ribbing on the wings. Use natural animal detail whenever possible to add realism to your dragon drawing. For example, the plates of a turtle shell can make the dragon's underbelly. The fringe on an iguana's back can easily transform into a dragon's fringe. Shark teeth can add a more dangerous look to a crocodile head. Get creative, using as many animal features as you can to bring your art to life.    Step5: Erase unnecessary marks and darken final lines. Add shading and background to create a three-dimensional effect. If your dragon breathes fire, add flames, smoke and smoldering ruins to your drawing.

AA12181796	A site created to help identify and put a stop to abusive relationships gives a list of warning signs. According to this site, you may be in an abusive relationship if:    - "your partner is jealous or possessive toward you"  We all know this is true of Edward; he is unbelievably possessive. Even the fangirls admit this; they just seem to find it romantic.    - "your partner tries to control you by being very bossy or demanding."  Absolutely. "Don't be difficult, Bella."    - "your partner tries to isolate you by demanding you cut off social contacts and friendships."  This is precisely what he did with Jacob.    - "your partner is violent and / or loses his or her temper quickly."  Edward's mood swings are more sudden than a hormonal woman's.    - "your partner claims you are responsible for his or her emotional state."  Edward goes one better and basically claims that Bella is responsible for his entire *life*.    - "your family and friends have warned you about the person or told you that they are concerned for your safety or emotional well being."  A lot of people see that Edward is controlling and abusive towards Bella. Jacob is the obvious one, but there's also Charlie, and even Alice points out at one point that his behaviour is unacceptable.    - "you frequently worry about how he or she will react to things you say or do."  Bella panics about upsetting Edward constantly.    - "your partner makes "jokes" that shame, humiliate, demean or embarrass you, whether privately or around family and friends."  Bella is constantly "chagrined" around Edward, *because* of Edward. "Chagrin" means to be distressed because of failure or humiliation. At one point in Midnight Sun, Edward says that he enjoys Bella's chagrin when he tells her he's not going to let her do something. Honestly, I don't think Meyer knows what chagrin actually means, but that's her problem.    - "your partner "rages" when they feel hurt, shame, fear or loss of control."  Edward frequently gets angry when things don't go his way.    Another "check list" asks, "Does your partner destroy or take your personal property or sentimental items?" which of course Edward does at the beginning of New Moon.    Also there's the fact that he stalks her and breaks into her room to watch her sleep. This is so unbelievably creepy that the fact that anyone finds it flattering or romantic is truly scary.|`|kUE3Ddktaa	A huge part of emotional abuse is control:  - who the person spends time with  - where the person goes  - keeping tabs on the person at all times  - telling the person what or what not to do  - financial control (credit cards, etc)    I think you can find examples of Edward doing all of these things to Bella.|`|AA12065466	he rips apart her car to prevent her from seeing jacob.  he won't leave her alone at ALL.  he basically treats her like a baby.    yes, he loves her or whatever but there is a limit|`|FvGKbFlaaa	haha. That's hard because he is beyond perfect!|`|daza5A4vaa	Well, I find it pretty obvious.  Have you read New Moon?  She's a walking zombie for months.    It's like he gets into her head, mashes it up, and pulls himself back out.    He's painfully controlling. "You can't do this, you can't do that," "In no way are you allowed to see Jacob."  What kind of boyfriend does that?  He keeps her locked up. Watches her while she sleeps. Stalks her. Abuses her friends. I could go on forever.|`|A1PLJKhUaa	They don't have an emotionally abusive relationship, or otherwise abusive...the physical event you are referring to was totally accepted by Bella, she knew the risks. And as the books are written from Bella's point of view, you can clearly see that she neither has the personality trademarks of an emotionally abused woman, and nor, for that matter, is she an abused woman.    If you're gonna right something, why not try analysing the Bella-Edward-Jacob love triangle a little more. It's something every teenager goes through, I'm sure many would read it with interest.|`|lbeHwVGTaa	You could say that when they got busy he literally banged her up(you know which way i mean) and then he got her pregnant with a baby that killed her. And also he left her which made her fall into a state of depression which could have caused her to commit suicide. WOW! i never realized how much edward was an abuser|`|XGzC67P5aa	To prevent her from seeing Jacob, he keeps her in his house (or at least he tells Alice to) and doesnt let her out!!|`|XuK5CAQ2aa	No matter how much I love Edward, it cannot say he doesn't abuse her, emotionally. He pretty much took over her life, but I doubt he did it on purpose. He won't let her see certain friends, and he kind of stalks her. But I know it's out of love. Lol.|`|aAqxTw98aa	read midnight sun for gods sake. edward never abuses bella. hed never even dream of hurting her. he feels horrible towards what happened in new moon too. there is no abusal what so ever.|`|CjPtAEzmaa	Stealing property, damaging her car to 'protect her'. (What a jerk. Let her freaking make her own decisions.)    Also, especially in Eclipse, there's a big number of times that Bella asks permission to do something from Edward (can I go this place this weekend, etc.) and sometimes he says no. Like he's her master or something. >.>    Oh, and sneaking into her house in the middle of the night to watch her sleep. Stalking, and breaking and entering are both crimes.|`|zHZXYsjvaa	a few ways he abuses her:  -He stalks her  -He watches her when she sleeps  -He is controlling and takes away the freedom the the United States Constitution gave her  -He trashed her car so she could do what she wanted (which is sort of an example of the reason above this one)  -She cheats on him with Jacob Black  -He protects her... ALL THE TIME!! there's such thing as too much of a good thing....    that's all i can think of, but i'm sure there is a ton more.|`|R02aazVdaa	This isn't domestic abuse, but it's something you could add to support your idea. Edward started watching Bella when she was sleeping in the first book, which is pretty creepy in my opinion. Some people think it's romantic, but how would they feel if it was a balding 50 year old hobo?|`|Tu4OTf8oaa	i dont really think its an abusive relationship in ANY way...but for the sake of the press:   - she is is DANGER any time she is near him, but too blindly in love to realize that and to save herself   - he refuses to leave her alone because he thinks someone will take her   - she stalks her at night   - in the second book, he leaves her without explanation, and she becomes SUPER depressed...   - when he is in danger, she feels worried and DEPRESSED   - he says that if she dies, he will kill himself   - when they screwed eachother in the last book, she had bruises all over her body   - he wont let her see jacob    i think thats enough...and is that what you meant?|`|ZCV4ZZHEaa	you cant  because they dont have a abusive relationship!|`|dkl61MSJaa	um he doesn't?     they have an emotionally dependent relationship but its by no means abusive.|`|GSRBodwEaa	Maytee, wasn't abusive, and it's a BOOK, who cares. :D|`|I7kYdVF8aa	welll  the main point is his overprotectiveness  and the Bella's obsessiveness of him   but thats not really his fault|`|AeVnK1igaa	Let's see...    -Takes apart her car to prevent her from seeing a friend  -Bribes his sister to keep her away from the same friend  -Wants to make all the decisions on his own despite her wishes  -Won't listen to what she wants  -Is always watching her/listening to her conversations  -HE WATCHES HER SLEEP AT NIGHT.

a9b827de122bad4f9d240aa2a6072d2faa	Depends on how you flush out the meaning. I would say that it amounts to a conditional statement, expressed more formally:    If the cheerleader is saved, then the world is saved.  -or-  If you save the cheerleader, then you save the world.    Conditional statements are not arguments.|`|jCC7ULrmaa	I guess it is expressing an idealist dialectic, in the sense that if the world is created by the consciousness of the individual, then to the cheerleader the act of saving her life would he the act of saving the world, as she creates the world in her own consciousness, and when her consciousness is obliterated, through death, her world is also obliterated.|`|1rNVgEDIaa	It's a slogan.

In answer to the question, I say that it is an argument in that it asserts a position that can be refuted.

This shows how many people put their money together to help others around the world, creating a unity. Im not sure how you are going to be able to incorporate the many voices aspect (maybe spreading the word can be an example?) but im pretty sure that you can bs that in there. As for a posterboard, taking the same kiva concept, you can include  handprints and lips going around in a circular shape, and then make the inside the world, and you can have examples of some of the cases/ loan stories, the history, and the process of how the money travels (from the lender, to the loaner, and then back to the lender). i would guess that this is somewhat out of the box, but its a good start. Good luck!|`|7Ty9Uhmhaa	then you need to think outside the box...you cant rely on other people to be imaginitive for you...you wont go far with that...so use your own imagination and think outside the box...go to a different place or where there are lots of different cultures...    good luck
RXtUaI5baa	Drawings, sketches, prints, and unframed art is generally offered matted with archival materials and encased in an archival art sleeve.  Invest in a mat cutter (mine cost around $100 and has saved me hundreds of dollars in matting costs) and you will be able to produce professionally cut mats easily.     As far as the paper on which you do your drawings, pick an acid-free archival paper.  If you use colors, make sure it is rated light-fast.  Drawings can be done on Arches cover, Stonehenge rising, Ingres, Rives BFK, laid finishes, vellum, bristol, and Canson, Fabriano, and banana, hemp and linen papers,  as well a host of others. Do not limit yourself to using just one kind of paper, but experiment, as even graphite drawings can take on a whole new dimension on handmade papers and other grounds.

Ow3O7h4caa	Hi    First thing is to make sure the locking mechanism is not tightened.    If the bridge is leaning to much towards the rear of the guitar, then you will need to first, tune your guitar to pitch....  .... now flip it over and remove the back plate to access the springs and loosen the screws holding the springs 1 or 2 turns. Now, retune the guitar to pitch. If still not to your liking , loosen again and retune . Do this until you have the desires leverage to divebomb or what not.    If the bridge is leaning towards the front, then you will need to loosen the strings because, you will need to tighten the screws holding the springs. This causes the strings to stretch. Now tune your guitar and continue to tighten (one full turn at a time) retune, etc.... until you are satisfied and the tremolo moves freely.  Usually, 1/8 to 3/16" clearance from the body is good enough for dive bomb.     Once you are satisfied, then you can lock the top nut mechanism. Email me if you have issues. :-)|`|7VpDEkC6aa	If I'm understanding this correctly....Your bridge is now floating at a steeper angle that it used to.    I'm not real familiar with the Edge tremolo system so I might be a little off on my advice, I have always played a Strat with a vintage tremolo.    But one thing wrong might be that you have put on strings that are a heavier gauge than before. For instance you had on .008 gauge and now you put on .010's.  that would make the string tension tighter than before, therefore pulling your bridge up higher.    Try loosening your strings until the bridge goes back level. then loosen and re-seat the bridge mounting pivots or screws to make sure the bridge is firmly seated in the mounting. Then retighten it and retune it.  If it is still funky, you'll probably have to tighten the spring anchor that holds the springs to the body, to increase the spring tension against the string tension to equalize the bridge at the proper "floating position"  So you won't want to loosen the springs you'd want them tighter.    On a vintage strat tremolo that distance is 1/8th above the body.    Here is also an Ibanez forum that discusses your problem. Between both me and them you should be able to solve your problem.  http://www.jemsite.com/forums/f21/proble...    Another problem is that if you removed any of the tremolo springs and didn't put them back there is not enough tension to pull the bridge back. There should be at least 3 springs (I think)   Here is also the instructions for Ibanez tremolo:    http://www.ibanez.co.jp/world/manual/gui...    http://static.keebali.com/jemsite.com/te...    According to these instructions, If you have a locking tremolo, then you DO have to change one by one.  Or else it will do just what you said it did. So you will have to re-adjust your bridge float angle.    All those sites ought to give the info you'll need to get yourself back to normal    good luck

f4Nn0W1xaa	Bigotry. I believe that if you want to hate some one you should take the time to get to know them. Then you can hate them on their own merits rather than because of the group to which you've assigned them.    Because of that attitude of mine I can find myself getting pretty angry at the neocons and fundamentalists who like to build little black or white boxes in which to place the rest of us. The level to which discourse has sunk and the death of statemanship in politics makes me angry, when it isn't depressing the hell out of me.    The growing gap between the rich and the poor angers me, especially when I read about the salaries and perks of incompetent CEOs. I also get angry at overprivileged people who really believe that they got where they are by merit rather than good fortune and see those with less as entirely culpable for their own poverty.

As a result of this unholy union between angels and female human beings, God declared that angels could never again have sex with human beings.    Now that we have gotten that far, let's explain something to you.      God is all things, both male and female, and there are expressions of God as female (there is a counterpart to the male God figure, called Mother God, or Goddess, or Azna...among others).  God expresses not only in terms of gender but as the genderless or neuter.  Angels do not have genitalia, they are without sexual capability as far as I am aware (although, the Bible implies they must have at one time, had the ability).  If the Genesis story of angels having sex with women is somehow true, it must be that these angels came to inhabit male human bodies and then used the function of those bodies to perform the sex - i.e., they possessed the bodies of human males in order to have sex - which is probably why God found them in violation and forbade them from doing it again.    You have to understand that God in pure form is Spirit and that sex is a physical expression - but that there can be spiritual forms of male-ism and female-ism in terms of functionality of God.      Why would God ever want to pollute heaven with the problems we have here on earth - such as making an issue of race?  I for one, look forward to being in the Spiritual heaven where all such matters of separation, hatred, violence, anger, resentment, discord, war - are left behind.  What does it matter what we look like?  God is pure white light, pure energy - and that is what our souls are - pure white energy. There is no need to distinguish when all in God's presence are equal. We don't need to be carrying the sickeness of race discrimination with us to the next world where peace and harmony reign and I, for one, look forward to and highly desire, that peace and harmony.    Think about the fact that God created the angels for a purpose and a reason.  They were created as messengers.  That is their purpose and reason (as far as I am aware)...and how is it that you think they only stand like statues and obey him?  Perhaps their entire hearts are filled with such love for God that not one of them would ever want anything else but to obey God.  Their purpose in being created did not include being like the souls of human beings.  It appears like you would like to see the dischord and disharmoney and arguments, anger, resentment, dischord that exists on earth in heaven.  Let me clue you - It isn't going to happen - not ever.|`|DEeNajsMaa	The first question you yourself must answer is what your question is. People have constructed their own interpretations from the Bible and from that constructed a religious culture. The Bible was assembled after thousands of years from many sources. Christians believe that the writings within the Bible are God inspired (that it was God's will that took part in the writing and assembling). But more importantly, the Bible was written from God by men to men. And so much of the Bible includes culture of that time just as now from different cultures to the next, thus thoughts such that Jesus was white exists (Jesus was not white ... he was Middle Eastern).    Secondly, attempting to rationalize religion can never happen because it's not about rationalizing it. Angels are not human. And thus are not bound to human emotion and human failings. Furthermore, people screw up blatantly everyday and doesn't that mean we're a piece of work too?     Third, you have to ask yourself why you are asking this question. Since the only reason one would believe is because God has revealed himself to you. You can't choose one day to believe. It isn't a nine step plan. It's a realization from God. And so, any doctrines that one might find ridiculous can be examined in the view of a believer and a non-believer.     Lastly, the question honestly doesn't matter. For those who find that the fire and brimstone people got to lighten up on their Biblical doctrine, how about actually practicing Christianity and not some patchwork version that makes you feel good. The question that should be asked is "since we know that humanity is evil, where does evil not exist?" This is where God comes in. This is Nietzsche argument that for humanity to have a purpose there must be a God. But since in his mind there is no God, then humanity does not have a purpose (since we are to evil to do so, anything we attempt will fail and diverge from the purpose).    Within Genesis there exists the remnant of Semitic myth. If you actually study Genesis, the creation story resembles that of many others around the general area of the Middle East (but most creation stories are the same or share similar attributes). So you have to be careful about Biblical interpretation because you have to understand the the actual historical context of the text and who wrote it. What influenced the writing. And what was the purpose of the writing.|`|aZnxRbu1aa	You need to read the bible a little closer before you start saying these things.|`|AA11635601	None of this rant is supported by anything - it's immature and even unwise to sling religious words around with no foundation, in my opinion.|`|qDYzdz5daa	Y'know, I'm not religious, but even I know that everything you assert in your "question" is wrong.    Angels (at lest, the few that even look vaguely humanoid) aren't described by their color in any Biblical book.  The only places angels are depicted are in art, and there are plenty of black ones, and other colors.    And that's just your first sentence.  I could go further, but curing ignorance is my day job, not my night one.
Eos7bQKRaa	well I'm not going to tell you to pursue him, because it does seem pointless. i would say focus your energy on yourself for now. your eduacation and hobbies, developing your skills, figuring out what you want to do in this life....not only will this take your mind of him, but you will develop a stronger sense of self and get to define your identity. i thing stuff like that help you feel more independent and secure without the need of constant affection or the reassurance of an older boyfriend. If you get there, your confidence will make you more attractive, and more guys would probably be drawn to you, so no need to pine over an unattainable love...

Many artists put paintings in progress (unfinished), so others can see how they work.    Good luck with your creating!
1YBo8yhOaa	This advice may not be what you want, but I recommend that you study the great masters of painting from the Renaissance to today.  The masters have not only mastered the technical parts of their craft, but also how to tell a story most effectively.  Study each painting and try to decide what story the painter is trying to depict.  Think about how you would try to do the same thing with a camera.  For the paintings that speak to you the most, try to set up a similar tableau and take the pic.  Did it work?  Keep at it until it does work.  This will help you develop the feel for pics that are more than just a snapshot, and that moves into fine art.    PS:  This is why I recommend that anyone who wants to be a professional get a fine arts degree.  Anyone can take a picture, but you have to compose fine art no matter what the medium is.|`|HlQCmCG0aa	All 'great' photos tell a story, maybe you mean a 'great' story also?

Keep a neat, in order, notebook. Keep current on homework. Don't let it pile up and try and do it all at once. If you have questions, ask. If you don't understand, ask. If you have a friend that is doing well in class, ask what study methods he/she uses. Ask the teacher for extra help. It might also help to outline the chapter, or parts of it, so you have a ready reference of the material.  Check and see if your school or library offers peer tutoring.

k8AcVixTaa	If you are doing amateur work then why buy a "professional" camera.....|`|C77c0OE2aa	If the same lens is used on each camera, you would not be able to tell ANY difference in the photos they produce. They both use the same sensor and processor.    The only difference between them is build strength. Well, and also the larger capacity battery on the 1Ds, (but you can always get an add on battery grip for the 5D for MUCH less money than the price of the 1Ds).    So it really comes down to the rugged build quality of the 1Ds. If you are not planning to use your camera in harsh outdoor environments on a regular basis, there is really no need for buying the 1Ds. That camera is built to take the rigors of hard, dirty, photo-journalistic work such as war correspondents in Iraq and the like. It is just really not needed by even most professional photographers.    I would suggest buying the 5D Mark II and spending the extra money on L lenses. Even if something ever happened to the 5D body, you could buy another brand new one for less than the cost difference between it and the 1Ds.    I am honestly quite amazed that Canon released the 5D Mark II. I would think they will severely cripple sells of the 1Ds.    steve|`|f8a9y13maa	both are great cameras btu if it just amateur wor you might want to go with the less expensive or just choose a good digital, but if u are going for the more professinal look i would go with 5d mark2  but whichever you decide they both are good for all your needs just get good lenses and maybe take some photography courses so u can learn how to use your camera to your advantage  good luck and have fun with whichever you choose|`|AZgIkmfxaa	If you buy a DSLR, you're going to be dropping some major coin.

yWloDrF8aa	As there seems to be some confusion over the type of exposure meter that the your 124 model has, please look at the area at the front of the folding hood.  If it has a rectangular window then it has a Selenium cell which does not use batteries.  If it has a circular window then it uses a Cadmium Sulfide cell which does need batteries.  If it is a Cadmium Sulfide cell you will probably find a battery compartment lid below the focusing knob and next to the lower spool locking knob.  The battery compartment lid opens by turning counter-clockwise.  The original battery used was either a PX13 or EPX13 1.35V  Mercuric Oxide 450 mAH battery which has long since been discontinued.  You'll find alternative battery suggestions here -   http://www.photoethnography.com/ClassicC...  You may find that whichever type of exposure meter cell is fitted that it will probably have become unreliable with age so you may wish to consider the purchase of a hand held exposure meter which can measure both reflected or incident light and will prove itself more versatile and useful than a built in meter.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	It doesn't need batteries.  http://www.camerapedia.org/wiki/Yashica_...|`|AA12185092	It doesn't use a battery.

z36j8rmRaa	It didn't.  Draco overpowered Dumbledore when he de-wand him and the Elder wand gave it's allegiance to Draco.  Then Harry Potter overpowered Draco and the wand again exchanged it's allegiance.|`|N0A8mCuzaa	Draco was supposed to kill him . . . he disarmed him so the plan back fired.      The Elder Wand, known throughout history as the "Deathstick" and the "Wand of Destiny", is an extremely powerful wand made of elder wood with a core of Thestral tail hair.[4] Supposedly, it is the most powerful wand in existence, and when used by its true master, he or she cannot be defeated in a duel. It also appears, as the wand is somewhat sentient, as are all wands, that it will not allow itself to cause real harm to its true Master. As stated by Mr Ollivander the wandmaker, the wand will only fully work for the new user if they directly disarm, stun or kill the previous user. This can occur during a duel (although because the wand is very powerful, this scenario would be rare), or in non-magical ways (killing in Muggle fashion, etc). Rowling has stated that the wand is brutal in its choice of master, that, whilst most wands have some allegiance to their own masters, the Elder Wand only responds to power. If a master dies naturally without ever being defeated, the wand's power will die too, as it had never been won from its master.    After boasting of his unbeatable wand, Antioch Peverell met his end  murdered in his sleep by a rival wanting to claim the wand. Ever since, power-hungry wizards have sought the wand. It eventually came to the possession of Gregorovitch, a Bulgarian wandmaker. Gregorovitch boasted about how he possessed the Elder Wand, as it would boost his popularity as he tried to reverse engineer its secrets as he faced competition from Ollivander. It subsequently fell to Grindelwald, who stole it from the famed wandmaker. Ultimately Grindelwald was defeated by Dumbledore, who then assumed control of the wand, it being the "only hallow [he] was fit to possess, not to boast of it or kill with it, but to tame it."    When Dumbledore arranged his death with Severus Snape, he meant Snape to "end up with the Elder Wand." Because his death would not have been the result of his defeat, Dumbledore hoped this might break the wand's power. However, since Draco disarmed Dumbledore, the plan failed and Draco became the wand's new master. After Dumbledore's death, the wand was placed inside his tomb. At the beginning of the final book, Voldemort attempts to use a Killing Curse on Harry as the boy and the decoys attempt to flee Privet Drive: at this time Harry's wand mysteriously acts of its own accord and stops Voldemort. This is what causes Voldemort to seek the Hallow. Voldemort opened Dumbledore's tomb and claimed the wand as his own. Only later did he learn that he never mastered the wand because he did not gain ownership from its previous owner. Thereafter he slew Snape, not realizing that the wand's allegiance had passed to Draco, even though Draco never had the Elder Wand itself in his possession; furthermore, Draco was Disarmed by Harry, and thus relieved of the Elder Wand's allegiance, before Voldemort even took possession of the wand itself. In the Battle of Hogwarts, the Elder Wand recognizes its true master, and when confronted with Harry's Expelliarmus charm, the wand causes Voldemort's final Killing Curse to rebound and kill him.    Harry uses the Elder Wand to repair his damaged holly and phoenix feather wand (an act that Ollivander believed impossible according to what he knew  he mentions that wandlore is very ancient and complicated). Harry intends to return the wand to Dumbledore's tomb, in the hopes of fulfilling Dumbledore's original plan: for the reigning owner of the Elder Wand to die a natural death, thus ending its bloody trail of violence.    Rowling revealed in an interview that the first working title for Deathly Hallows was Harry Potter and the Elder Wand.[5]|`|xXbGJE3xaa	To get the power fo the Elder Wand, the previous owner does not have to be killed. At the end of the 6th book, Draco disarmed Dumbledore on the tower. Dumbledore never actually reclaimed his wand, it was only buried with him. So it was rightfully Draco's before Snape killed Dumbledore. Then Harry did the same thing. He disarmed Draco (it doesn't matter if Draco was using a different wand at the time) which in turn made him the owner of the Elder Wand.|`|Qim0aSKtaa	Honestly, I think she explained it in such a messed up backwards way that it doesn't actually make sense unless you insist to yourself that it makes sense.

Voldemort had the Elder Wand and Harry Had Draco's wand. When Voldemort yelled Avada Kedavra, and at the same time, Harry yelled Expelliarmus and the Elder wand flew out of Voldemort's hands and it flew towards Harry. Harry caught it and the Avada Kedavra spell had by now hit Voldemort. The Elder wand was never really Voldemort's even though he took it from Dumbledore. It was Snape's all along but it wouldn't work for Voldemort because he killed Snape but not in a duel because Snape had never had it when he was killed. The Wand then came into the possession of Harry, who , even though he hadn't really killed Voldemort himself, was the last living heir of Ignotus Peverell/ the Peverell brothers which is why the wand worked for him.|`|lnXFAmSaaa	Draco was SUPPOSED to kill Dumbeldor which would make Dumbledor's wand (i.e. the Elder Wand) Draco's.

Z19gRYZwaa	The odds are distinctly against you.  Ballet training at five will not do much for you twelve years later, particularly as five year olds do not get enough training to really build much technique. In ballet, 17 year olds are at an age where they are joining companies, not restarting after having spent most of their life on other things. Ballet takes very specific muscle development, which you do not get without careful training for several years. I don't know what besides gymnastics you have been doing, but gymnastics will interfere with your ballet posture, and most other activities will do something to mess you up: my teacher is always throwing fits over people doing things like running or sports or martial arts. So your muscle development will not be as good as that of other girls your age. They also have more of the background and muscle memory that will let them move properly and learn things more quickly. Then too, most people who haven't missed twelve years of training will never make it as professional dancers: ballet companies are smaller than they once were, and the competition for places is fierce.

7VpDEkC6aa	Well, I have no idea how much any of those items cost in the UK As we don't have Stagg or Burswood guitars in the US.    BUT as a general rule of thumb when trying to sell anything to a shop, the best possible price they would pay would be 50% of what they could resell it for.  That goes for any type of item whether it be music related, or as I know personally, rare and collectible books.    So I doubt anyone would sell your stuff at the "new" price. So think maybe they knock off 20% of the original value of the guitar and stuff, no matter what shape it's in, then add it up, then divide by half.    That's what you could reasonably expect a shop to pay for it. You'd make a lot more value by selling it on eBay UK or in the classified section of the papers.|`|sJIt2cJFaa	20 but i dont want/need 3 pedals
376abf017f5ceda0dc7a5f6414b42db2aa	I actually already knew what would happen to Dimitri before I finished reading the series, but I didn't think it would affect me so bad when I actually got around to the end of Shadow Kiss. It killed me!! I don't remember how much I cried, but I know that I did. A lot. Richelle Mead really is an awesome writer. Her Succubus Blues series is awesome too. It's so much like VA, but with different characters, different plots... but her writing just feels the same in just about every book of her's I've read (which is almost all of them. I still need to finish Storm Born).    I just know that Rose has to save Dimitri, because he can't remain Strigoi. It's just not right, not when he's basically what the whole book is about. I mean, well, the book is about more than just Dimitri, but he is a MAJOR part of the book. I don't think Rose would kill him, and she really does not love Adrian enough (if at all) to be with him. She has to be able to bring him back somehow, and I really think it will be Rose that does it. Even though the idea of Lissa being able to save Dimitri sounds nice and all, I just really think saving him will be something only Rose will be able to do. And I think the way she saves him will have something to do with her being shadow kissed.    I agree, I think Vampire Academy is a way awesome YA series. I love it. And I honestly think it is MUCH better than Twilight.|`|HZubplhvaa	I honestly ALMOST think the Vampire Academy series is better than the Twilight series.  I fell in love with Dimitri. Even Christian and Adrian.  The end of Shadow Kissed...I cried. I was amazed. I couldn't even talk for an hour. But then I got angry. I can't...I refuse to believe that he turned Strigoi.    Blood Promise...I think somethings going to happen. Since Rose is Shadow Kissed, I think somehow she can bring Dimitri back. She can't kill him. That can't happen.    Or maybe, somehow Lissa's powers will come through and she can heal him.    I MISS DIMITRI |`|c44dIboDaa	omg dimitri turns to a strogoi??!! no! i guess i didnt read it then..i know i read the first two! but yes i love this series!!! better go see if its at barnes and nobles!!|`|tvE4L8XJaa	i know it's rele sad... and sadly-er .... dimitri is a strigoi...     *weeeeeeeeppp*** im was rele sad too.     But i just have a great feeling that blood promise is going to be a really good book. I can't wait.. and in case you don't know, it comes out in august. and if you want more info, go to the author's website|`|CGQ6w2KHaa	gosh..i know... i was absolutly mortified when i read that he was turned.... i am still trying to get over it, and i read the book months ago!!!  i am really really really hoping that Mead can come up with SOME way to save him, so they can be together.....      although, i do believe that Adrian is being honest.. i think that he MIGHT actually have feelings for her, and not be playin her.. so idk.. tehres a chance they could get together... but i REALLY awnt her and Dimitri together.. they are so perfect for eachother.      as for the ending, other than just Dimitri being turned... i think Lissa was being a ***** for not wanting her to go, and then trying to use compulsion on her !  i mean, rose deffinatly deserves a chance to do something for herself, for dimitri.      i am dying for blood promise... as well as succubus heat (from Mead's succubus blues series)  if u haven't read the series yet, i definitly recomend it, althouhg it is pretty... descriptive? ya.. thats the word. xD  i've figured it out... the 3rd book is when Mead makes all the drastic changes that make you want to cry... x_x.       anyawy. as for now, all i can do is sit here and wait very impatiently for both the books... and hope for the best!!!! (like dimitri somehow being saved!!)

If I like the idea, I'll usually build upon it.|`|dXW9cPWMaa	The YouTube video is part of a vlog from young adult author John Green (fantastic writer, by the way), entitled "A Day in the Life." It's interesting and funny.    Personally, since I'm not a full-time writer, my days vary. I'm a full-time student double majoring in two difficult programs of study, so my writing is either during my procrastination time or late at night. Consequently, I've discovered that the majority of my best writing comes to me between the hours of midnight and four in the morning, oddly enough.    I can write with other people/distractions around, but it's never my best. I write well when it's quiet and I can focus, but I usually have my headphones in with some music that fits the scenes I'm writing (I'll put Wilco or William Fitzsimmons in for the quieter scenes, the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack for more up-tempo scenes, Beyonce or other crazy music for when I need the urgency of the moment, etc. Ben Folds is my constant, though.) I find that it's best if I don't know the words so that I'm not singing along in my head, and I can just float along with the music.    I also have to have my outlines and notes with me if I'm going to write. I carry a small notebook around with me 24/7 in case I get a fantastic idea (I once wrote an entire scene during church - sacreligious? Probably.).    As I said, I don't have a ton of free time, but I try to at least work on my notes/characters every day, even if I don't have the time to sit down and write (like tonight - I have an accounting test in the morning tomorrow, but I worked on my characters during my writing workshop class so I feel justified for today).
AA11215935	As the Civil War was moving toward its inevitable conclusion, General William Tecumseh Sherman marched 60,000 Union troops through Georgia and the Carolinas, leaving a 60-mile-wide trail of death, destruction, looting, thievery and chaos. In The March, E.L. Doctorow has put his unique stamp on these events by staying close to historical fact, naming real people and places and then imagining the rest, as he did in Ragtime.   Recently, the Civil War has been the subject of novels by Howard Bahr, Michael Shaara, Charles Frazier, and Robert Hicks, to name a few. Its perennial appeal is due not only to the fact that it was fought on our own soil, but also that it captures perfectly our long-time and ongoing ambivalence about race. Doctorow examines this question extensively, chronicling the dislocation of both southern whites and Negroes as Sherman burned and destroyed all that they had ever known. Sherman is a well-drawn character, pictured as a crazy tactical genius pitted against his West Point counterparts. Doctorow creates a context for the march: "The brutal romance of war was still possible in the taking of spoils. Each town the army overran was a prize... There was something undeniably classical about it, for how else did the armies of Greece and Rome supply themselves?"     The characters depicted on the march are those people high and low, white and black, whose lives are forever changed by war: Pearl, the newly free daughter of a white plantation owner and one of his slaves, Colonel Sartorius, a competent, remote, almost robotic surgeon; several officers, both Union and Confederate; two soldiers, Arly and Will, who provide comic relief in the manner of Shakespeare's fools until, suddenly, their roles are not funny anymore.     Doctorow has captured the madness of war in his description of the condition of a dispossessed Southern white woman: "What was clear at this moment was that Mattie Jameson's mental state befitted the situation in which she found herself. The world at war had risen to her affliction and made it indistinguishable." And later, " This was not war as adventure, nor war for a solemn cause, it was war at its purest, a mindless mass rage severed from any cause, ideal, or moral principle."       REVIEW:   Cry "Havoc," and let slip the dogs of war. , October 12, 2005  Reviewer: Leonard Fleisig "Len" (Washington, D.C.)                Mark Twain often blamed, not without some reason, the onset of the U.S. Civil War on the writings of Sir Walter Scott. Scott's romantic view (Twain called them Scott's enchantments) of war, chivalry, and honor colored southern culture to such an extent that war became inevitable. Any lingering romantic notions about war were put to rest by General William Tecumseh Sherman's march through the south. Sherman's view of war was simple: war is brutal and it must be fought with brutality and overwhelming strength if victory is to be achieved. Sherman's often brutal march through the south forms the centerpiece of E.L. Doctorow's "The March". Both havoc and the `dogs of war' form the underlying background against which the novel's plot plays itself out.     In a recent discussion about "The March" Doctorow stated that he intended to give the book a "Russian feel". In that he has succeeded. The broad canvas painted by Doctorow, a multitude of characters (both real and fictional) who meet, interact, and depart while war is waged all around them does contain stark similarities to Leo Tolstoy, Boris Pasternak, and Vasily Grossman. Doctorow's unique voice and style allows him to impart this "Russian" flavor to a novel about the Civil War without it seeming imitative or derivative. The March is an original and entertaining piece of work.     There are a host of characters in the book. Some, like Sherman, appears throughout. Others, who shall remain nameless, make an impact on the reader and advance the story but suffer untimely fates. As with any war untimely deaths are the rule rather than the exception. The other major characters include: Pearl, a newly freed slave who father was her former plantation master; Colonel Wrede Sartorius, a German born army surgeon; Arly and Will, two Confederate soldiers whose appearance and reappearance in Union and Confederate uniforms is both amusing and ultimately suspenseful; Stephen Walsh, a Union soldier who finds himself spending a lot of time with Pearl; and Emily Thompson, a southern woman who ends up as a nurse to Dr. Sartorious.     Doctorow devotees will recognize Dr. Sartorious as the evil Dr. Sartorius featured in Waterworks. They will also recognize the freed slave Coalhouse Walker as the father of jazz pianist Coalhouse Walker Jr. from Ragtime. These `coincidences' are not central to the plot but does engage the reader with background information about the characters not readily apparent from the reading.     The book progresses along with Sherman's march. We see southern cities burnt down at the least sign of resistance and we see captured Union soldiers executed without cause. War is indeed hell and the havoc of war is omnipresent. Doctorow is unstinting of his portraits of all his characters be they northern or southern. There is no such thing as a romantic hero; there is simply brutality in the name of survival and accommodation to the dogs of war barking at everyone's feet.     One noticeable element of The March is the easy transformation of the characters into different versions of themselves. Will and Arly's rapid changes are the most evident of them. So too is Pearl's transformation from a timid slave girl into a Union drummer boy and then a nurse. All around the novel such changes abound. The war, for all its brutality, provides many of the characters in the novel with the freedom to change themselves and society's perception of them. The boxes to which we are consigned are put aside and we are then free

lPxVt2XYaa	In purely economic terms his policies were a success. The Five Year Plans built vast factories in places like Stalingrad, Leningrad and other cities across the Soviet Union. They also built hydro-electric dams, canals, railways and other infrastructural projects. The aim of them was to modernise Soviet industry, to try to bridge the gap between the Western Democracies (including, after 1933 Nazi Germany). The Soviet Union before Stalin was still a backward, almost medieval country, roads were unmade, most people lived in villages in wooden houses and had no electricity, the five year plans changed all that - they created a massive urban working class, most of the country was electrified and in the cities most people lived in new apartments. And, most importantly, they provided the economic, political and social conditions that allowed the country to absorb the Nazi assault beginning in 1941 and to eventually push them all the way back to Berlin.  Collectivisation was also a success. The aims of collectivisation were three-fold; to create a rural working class - peasants were paid wages (lower than urban workers) and the land and machinery was now owned by the collective. Collectivisation as also designed to modernise farming practises to create a surplus to sell abroad for hard currency and to free up manpower as they wee needed in the new factories; and finally it was designed to break the peasants as a political force. Peasants in the Soviet Union were deeply religious and conservative, and were seen, therefore, as a threat to the regime - the terroristic party The Socialist Revolutionaries had been mostly drawn from the peasantry. Again, like the five year plans, the policy fulfilled its goals.    However, the human cost of the policies was terrible. Industrialisation was harsh - being late for work was an arrestable offence, many were arrested or for "wrecking" - i.e. when a machine broke or when someone made a mistake at work, and political prisoners were used as slaves on many of the big infrastructure projects, notably on the White Sea Canal. The Holodomor - the Ukrainian famine caused by collectivisation killed about 2.5 million, and peasants resented having their land taken from them, but complaining could also lead to arrest, deportation or death.  See:  http://www.marxists.org/archive/dunayevs...  http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/col...  http://www.holodomor.org/|`|3QsPl1uLaa	That depends on the goals, values and objectives of the person judging success or failure. Take Collectivization:  1. Reasons the policy was adopted. To strength the control of government.  2. Measures taken to enforce the policy. Kill off the rich peasant class called Kulaks. Steal all farm land.  3. Successes/Failures of the policy. All private farm land taken over. Agricultural production collapsed.  4. The human cost of the policy. Million starved to death in the Ukraine.  Stalin cared nothing about the death toll.|`|5VD9fVa1aa	Well, he killed 20 million people to implement them, so I would say overall FAIL.
QYPrM3GPaa	Why don't you read Genesis in the Bible.  That will tell you everything you want to know about what > Christians believe.    I said SOME and made a big deal out of it, because I am a Christian who doesn't believe in the Genesis story.  To me, it is a lot of clap trap, so I am one Christian who does NOT believe in it.  There are many other Christians who do not believe in Genesis.  I happen to be both a Christian AND an Evolutionist.    It is the fundamentalist Christian nut cases who insist that in order to be a Christian you have to accept the Genesis fairytale.  Jesus never said anyone had to believe in this story - and none of the Christian fanatics can find a single reference that says you have to, in the Bible.    I wouldn't expect a bunch of goat hearders and sheep hearders from four thousand years ago to understand modern biology and genetics any more than you would expect them to - they had to have some way to explain how all of this came to be, so they came up with their story of how they thought it all happened.  I only accept scientific proof regarding evolution.|`|EFjrJmdXaa	Well Christians believe that God created the earth and man. I don't understand how your teacher could expect you to biologically explain this though. If scientists in the area of biology can't even explain the concept of God then how would you be able to? I am not sure what to tell you. If your teacher does not want any biological explanation and just wants you to describe the other peoples beliefs then a being beyond human imagination created man and earth.|`|DEeNajsMaa	There are different interpretations of Genesis' creation story. For those who believe it literally, don't.    The creation story in Hebrew is written in a poetic style (basically it was a poem and you don't take poems literally). Also, there are two creation stories in Genesis. So to begin with the "creation" is a lot more complex than the Sunday school teacher teaches you. Adam in Hebrew means "man" in the sense of man kind. The word it references - man - in Hebrew is derived from the word for earth (dirt, dust, ground). So the poetic sense is clear (also Eve means life). Also, the purpose of  creation was to focus on God creating the world. During ancient semitic times, there existed many creation stories, and so, for the early Jews, the creation story was a mix of culture and myth.     Cain and Abel , children of Adam and Even, are references to the hunter gatherer community and the agrarian community. Their dispute is also a reference to the conflict between these two groups during ancient semitic times. Also, other myths at that time also share similarities with the story of Cain and Abel (Babylonian myth of sheep and farmer gods).     So, if you really study Genesis creation story, you must understand the purpose of it. For the Jews, it was forming the creation in the perspective of God and assimilating other cultures. (Just as early Christians were persecuted, the Christians celebrated Jesus' birth during the winter solstice to avoid persecution and getting arrested. Later Constantine officially moved the holy day to assimilate pagan religions.)     Thus, what Christians believe, if they really really do read the Bible and study it, is that God created the Earth and created man. How he did it, we do not know because the Bible does not break it down into every detail. Lastly, the Bible is a book of trivia. It is what God gave us to better understand him and ourselves. It's about faith. Not whether or not expansion theory validates the Big Bang theory or whether or not macro evolution exists.
UsTyc0oeaa	The first question you should ask is "who else do you represent?".  They should give you references of others that they have gotten gigs for, and you should talk to these people and see if they are satisfied with the gigs that the agents have gotten them.    Then, ask the agent how he/she is going to represent you.  Will they put you in their files and forget about you?  Will they only mention you if a casting agent or talent-consumer asks for someone who closely matches your description?    A GOOD agency should be actively promoting you, even if you don't perfectly fit the criteria of what casting agents are looking for.  Your agent should "sell" these people on thinking outside their parameters and considering you.  You, as the "talent", should be able to grow and stretch outside of your comfort zone to fit these roles.    And remember, NEVER pay an agency to represent you.  They should be paying YOU, not the other way 'round.    Good luck!

AA11237062	I love Leica M models too, but they're not the most practical cameras...     They're compact, but not small enough to fit in your pocket. Leica has some great lenses, but the image quality is not noticeably better than what you can achieve with pro quality Canon/ Nikon gear. The manual focusing is quick, but usually slower than with a decent AF system. The viewfinder has some clever correction for parallax, but it's not as accurate as a dSLR. A Leica M - be it film or digital - can not begin to compete with quality dSLR cameras when it comes to action/ low light photography. And as for macro photography, long tele lenses, and zoom lenses, you can forget about all of that with a Leica M.    Leica's main advantages are their almost silent operation and the relatively small form factor. This (still) makes them a great choice for candids. For general photography, however, you'd be better off with a Canon 5D Mk2 or a Nikon D700 with some fast primes... or a 24-70mm f/2.8 zoom. And *then* there's the price. You could have an extra $6000 to spend on the rest of the trip. (If you think Leica bodies are expensive, wait til you add two or three lenses.)    If you're still seriously interested in a Leica, I'd decide on the body in combination with the lenses. Don't worry about the M8 becoming outdated.    For me, the M8 / M8.2 throw the lens selection off by having a 1.33 crop factor. A 35mm lens effectively becomes 47mm due to this. To achieve roughly a 35mm field of view for street photography, you'd require either a 24mm or 28mm lens. Leica has some very nice options, but I'd rather use their current 35mm f/1.4 asph as my main lens; it could very well be the nicest lens they've ever made. For me, this alone would dictate an M7. In fact, that's probably all I'd take with me - I'd leave the 50mm and 90mm at home.    So the question really is, what (range of) lenses would you get with either an M7 or M8? Which combination of gear makes the most sense for what you intend to shoot?    When I went on a round the world trip myself in 2007-8, what I actually took with me was a Nikon D200 with a 17-55mm f/2.8 zoom and a 50mm f/1.4. Today I'd take a Nikon D700 with a 24-70mm f/2.8.  ---  added: About the M3 suggestion, if you're not comfortable setting the exposure manually, skip it. With the M3 you have to use an attachment exposure meter and that quickly becomes a p.i.t.a. The M7 has aperture priority mode.    I've only seen a hand full of people use a Leica M in the last few years. (They draw my attention faster than any professional dSLR... I've also only seen a hand full of people use medium format in the wild.) Of the Leica owners, one or two were using the camera as intended. Two or three others were using it to take poorly timed and composed snapshots - nothing wrong with buying an expensive camera for the joy of using it - and the rest were seemingly wearing their Leica as jewelery. Leicas are very desirable objects but as cameras they don't make a lot of sense outside of their niche. Almost everyone, from absolute beginner to seasoned pro, would produce a better photo album with a $1500 dSLR setup.|`|lHLDvVALaa	If I were in your situation, I'd definitely look long and hard at an M3 and a small selection of lenses-a 28mm, 50mm, and 135mm would be an ideal selection.     You can shove them into a small bag or even a big pocket, and this combination will weigh so little that you won't even notice it.     Buy used(from KEH.com or any other used equipment dealer), and you'll save some money over buying new. Take care to keep them in the same condition you bought them in, and you can likely sell them a few years down the road for what you paid.     Yes, Leicas are expensive, but they're a safer investment than the stock market in the current economy.     Personally, I would avoid the M8. From what I've seen, the image quality is where DSLRs were two years ago, plus they drop in value like crazy verses what they were new.     You will get superb image quality from an M3, and film isn't nearly as inconvenient as people make it out to be.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Buy the Leica M8.2. You won't be sorry. Its actually an improvement over the M8. There will never be a cell phone, regardless of how many megapixels it has, that will take a picture 1/10th. as good as your Leica.    Worrying about future obsolescence is futile.    The Nikon D3x and Canon 1Ds Mark III will both be obsolete before the end of 2009. Should a professional photographer who needs their capabilities now put off buying one of them until the newest model is released? That would be dumb, wouldn't it, since they might lose work?    Today's top of the line computer will be considered obsolete in 6 months or less. If your company needs to upgrade their computers now to improve productivity would it be smart of them to wait for the newest model and let productivity lag for now?    NOTE: I am using "obsolete" in the sense that a "new, improved model" will be released.|`|k8AcVixTaa	I like Edwin's suggestion.  Technology will catch up regardless of the camera.  Besides, in a years time they will have a new model out so I really wouldn't worry a whole lot about it.      I have never used a Leica but have always wanted one.  But, I am  an old school photographer who favors film over digital.....|`|5M0FBU89aa	Leica equipment is VERY expensive - even sixty year old M1's.    Granted, you have REALLY good taste- but if you're not a pro, why not get something nice (like a Canon or Nikon) and pocket the rest?    A Canon rangefinder camera is really just about as good and cost $100 on eBay.    IMO, If you want to treat yourself to a $1K+  camera, get a digital AF 15MP Nikon.        If you *insist* on a film camera get something like a Pentax MX-10; Automatic-everything (AF/AE) with two lenses for around $100 on eBay also....    Film is both going away, and processing is hazardous to the environment.    Edit:  Yikes- some real Leica-lovers here...    Sorry - I just didn't think it was that great of a camera when my Dad let me use his.    PS- he thought it was too expensive, too, but it was a "company" camera - So next time you fly a Boeing jet, you'll know why the plane is so expensive :-)

Like a handicap, illnes or really major life change... that kind of thing can really make people think.

I guess this is just my 2c... there's a lot to this subject.    If this is about marriage or a girlfriend/boyfriend, then you do not want to go into this thing thinking that "oh, he will change, or I will change him"... that would be a very dumb thing to do.  God can change that person, but you're not God.  My sister married a person like that.  he never changed.

Don't forget that you have to have something to live on / pay yourself (unless you have other means of support).    2)  Are you ready to work 12, 14 or 16 hours a day for the first few years to launch the business?    3)  90% of all studios fail (for many reasons, but most often due to lack of business experience).

For a girl her age, twenty minutes a day is a great goal.      Make sure she comes to classes with her hair in a bun and in "ballet uniform" with shoes tied.  Make sure she has used the bathroom and had a snack before class.  This will ensure she can concentrate and learn as much as possible.

If something or somebody were in a midway position in one respect, it/they might be exceptional in another.  We might postulate a strange entity which was located exactly in the middle of all perceivable or possible continua.  But this would make it a very special thing indeed.

4cOjc8Xfaa	Tango Argentino is based on 8 fundamental moves. By putting combinations of these 8 together and using disassociation to keep each dancer connected 'heart to heart', all the named moves are derived.    Social TA at its best is completely improvised around the feeling of the music, and navigating the floor by inviting the woman to the next safe space. It is impossible to dance memorised sequences AND improvise. A good dancer therefore only considers the next step and his technique is based on choosing one of the 8 fundamental moves for himself and his partner.    The eight fundamental moves are:  Linear step forward  Linear step backward  Linear sidestep left  Linear sidestep right  Pivot on left anticlockwise, step fwds with right, pivot clockwise  Pivot on left clockwise, step back with right, pivot anticlockwise  Pivot on right clockwise, step fwds with right, pivot anticlockwise  Pivot on right anticlockwise, step back with left, pivot clockwise|`|JvmYeqH6aa	Whoa -    DjangoTango - you rock man!

Although most people believe it is very difficult to learn and master, the basics can be learned easily with some basic effort. The internet has great resources for both learning tango steps online and getting great video tapes or instructors to learn. As always there are great forums available for questions.    Good Luck and Have Fun,    Duncan Davis        Learning to Dance Tango As A Hobby  Takes Two To Tango     Tango is a lovely hobby and it is not surprising to find many people drawn to it. Tango is a dance form that involves the expression of feelings and you will see the dancers apparently gliding smoothly, in perfect sync with each other, performing complicated movements in time to the music.  You too can enjoy Tango as a hobby. Heres basic information about the types of tango, the types of music in tango, learning the tango and so on.  The Origins Of Tango    It is interesting to know that the Tango goes back as far as the 17th century to England. From England, it became the Contrdanse in France around 1700 from where it traveled to Spain as the Contradanza around 1750, to become the Danza in Cuba a quarter of a century later. This came to be known as the Habaner. The Tango as we know it today, evolved around 1910. From Cuba to Argentina seemed a natural route where it integrated with a variety of music and dance types, coloring it with Italian, Russian, Spanish, African and Polish forms. Around the 1940s the Tango took America and the rest of the world by storm.  Basics Of Tango    Tango is referred to as the Dance of Love. It is a Latin American Ballroom Dance that finds its origins in Argentina. Over time, Tango has evolved into different styles the world over. The concept basically is of two lovers being expressive with each other in different moods. One partner initiates movement with the heel of the foot. You will notice that eye contact is important in Tango.     Tango is danced in five beats, even though the rhythm is eight beats.  Some beats are more stressed than others.  The last beat could be a movement from the left to right or vice versa, or just a firm stomp.    Here Is A Very Quick Lesson For You:    As we mentioned earlier, you will take 5 steps in 8 beats. These are two beat measures in 4/4 time. Let us now put on a tango record or CD. Let your timing be Slow, Slow, Quick, Quick, Slow  thats five beats. If you listen carefully, you will know where to start your lead step or the first slow step, usually done by the man. The womans step begins with her right foot brought backward, the opposite of the mans step. So here you go  a slow left foot forward, a slow right foot forward, a quick left foot forward and a quick right foot forward, and then the left toe closes to right foot lightly, slowly.    That, in a nutshell is how you do the tango.    No drums are involved in tango music.  Instead, you will find violins, piano, and the bandoneons. Bandoneons are German instruments that produce an accordion like sound.  Styles Of Tango    As far as styles of tango go, we will hear of these:        * Argentine Tango      * American Style Tango      * International Style Tango    Each have their own rules followed quite stringently at competitions. Let us have a brief look at each style:  Argentine Tango    This has its beginnings in the West Indies and was confined to the lower classes. Tango comes from the African Tanganya.  The Argnetine tango, also called the Arrabalero originates from the Gauchos of Buenos Aires where it was first danced.  Argentine Tango has many variations called the Salon, Club, Fantasio, Nuevo, Club, Milonguero, and so on.  American Tango    American tango is performed at 32 measures per minute and 128-136 beats per minute in the 4/4 time. This style is structured to music and can be danced in the open as well as closed position.  International Tango    This is stricter and more disciplined, danced in the conventional closed positions and is the style you will see at the dance competitions and events.    There are also variations in tango like French Apache, which is danced to tango music and shows the tango dancers enacting a lovers tiff or passion. You will see the man fling the woman across the floor, while she crawls back, gracefully like a cat, to be embraced by him. This is not considered real tango since the steps are different from tango. The great Rudolf Valentino, an apache dancer, often danced the French Apache.     Tango Music    Carlos Gardel, a highly regarded tango singer in Argentina, is considered among the most well known and has been called the Voice of Tango. Different music styles in tango are the classic or conventional tango, the tango Nuevo that is a more recent form with difference in pace, instruments played, the Vals tango similar to waltzes, and the Milon
sunEk8NVaa	I guess if you base your answers on those two plans, which are about war reparations by Germany after WWI, it would seem like America tried to open its doors to internationalism but then...those were just two plans. Most of America's activities during the twenties showed that they were more willing to go back to isolation. This was mainly because Britain and France refused the fourteen points of Woodrow Wilson. Most of the American Public themselves wanted to keep America out of European affairs. Why do you think America never joined the League of Nations?     It must have been a big slap to Wilson and the American people after they helped win WWI, their allies refused their ideas to establish peace.

k8AcVixTaa	Depends on if you are getting the 120 film holga or the 35mm.  Some 1 hour places can't print 120 as the negative is bigger than their film holder.  If 35mm then yes.  Next part - black and white or color?  If black and white then it would have to be sent to a different lab.    Paper type depends on you and what you like.  I prefer glossy over matte.  Always have.  When I print in my darkroom I use glossy paper.|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	It depends.  Are you using 120 film or 35mm film?  Is it black and white, or a standard color film that uses the C-41 development process?    Are you using 120 film, or do you have an adaptor to use 35mm film in your camera?    Most 1-hour photo labs can't develop 120 film.  They will have to send it out to another lab.  Or you can just mail it out yourself.  There are a lot of labs that will develop 120 film.  Just do a search on Google.    You can get an adaptor for the Holga camera so that you can use 35mm film with it.  If you use standard color 35mm film, then any photo lab can develop it for you.  But if you use a black and white film, then you will have to send it to a professional photo lab.  The chemicals and machines used in most 1-hour photo labs are for color film.  You have to use different chemicals for black and white film.  (The chemicals and developing process for color film would destroy the images on B&W film).     By the way, the unusual effects that you get with "lomography" cameras, such as the Holga and Diana, have absolutely nothing to do with the film.  Lomography cameras are made almost entirely from plastic (including the lens!) and have defects such as light leaks, and soft focusing and color fringing because of the poor quality plastic lens.  Some people like those strange effects in their pictures, but you just need to remember that it's because of DEFECTS in the camera.  It has nothing to do with the film.  You will get the same effects, no matter where you have the film developed.

I guess I cant blame you, ive doen the same thing myself but the one thing that you can never do is forget just who you are in the world.    Its ok to forget for a little while, just never forget to remember    You have to know that you are you and you are your own person. No one but you can live how you've lived and no one but you can do what you do. With this in mind, no one but you can give real purpose in your life. Some people find it in God, some people find it in Art, some people find it in Charity, but what you have to keep in mind is that you have to do whats best for you.    Take some time to really figure out who you are and what you want to do with your life. Make sure that you remember that you exist and that you give your life essence...

As for making the columns round, start with wooden dowels, lots of them.  You will undoubtedly use a few of them in practicing cutting the fluting in the columns.  Good luck with it, and post a picture when you're done, okay?|`|5VD9fVa1aa	Use doweling for the columns (it's thin cylinders of wood available at any hardware store).

Of course I feel the same way about Disney items that are manufactured cheaply in China that falls apart when your child plays with it.

AA10729675	I agree with Roderick.  since it is practiced, we cannot say it falls under the category of mythology, but under "religion".  Besides, let's face it, Mythology is far more interesting than religion! Far more enriching, far more subtle, far more encompassing, and far more universal.  Like a neutral ground.  Religion is a game with fire.    What would fall under mythology?  Everything fictional that has been repeated along the centuries: epics, fairy tales maybe, history of the gods at large (without priests, garments, ceremonies etc...).|`|B4ORpmS9aa	I would think it would,since it talks about many of the same things as other types of mythologies do.The only difference is it involves just 1 god and not many different ones like the others do.|`|kuA09bzVaa	Your spelling and sentence structure should. Doing a research paper. I am just so sure.|`|05anyV31aa	I suppose so, but since it's being practised today.. it's not a myth. That's my opinion on it. But once it's ceased to be practised it becomes archaic mythology|`|q22bp4Gnaa	I would say it fits well with the term mythology.  Afterall, there are no FACTS involved with religion- only beliefs|`|wnkoTEqVaa	not religion but i would say the bible could.
yoGWCH3gaa	When you say you have three years experience... do you mean with playing a saxophone or some type or another instrument? If you are coming from clarinet, for example, the transition to Alto will be easier due to the size of mouth piece. Obviously you need to keep in mind that the embouchure is different.     The size of the instrument, as already stated by others, shouldn't be a concern for you. If you choose the Alto, simply because it's smaller, then you might want to reconsider and look at the true reasons to choose one saxophone over the other. Also, both the alto and tenor are popular in jazz and carry important roles within the band. If you enjoy improvising then you may want to lean more towards the Tenor, as the 1st Tenor in jazz bands serves as one of the main soloists (Much of Jazz repertoire has solo sections written for first Tenor).     As far as difficulty goes, both have intonation problems for beginners and even those who are more experienced. In my years of playing, however, I've found that the Tenor is the more challenging of the two to control proper pitch on due to the tendencies of the instrument and the larger mouth piece.     Price may also be a factor for you, but you shouldn't let it deter you from one or the other. Be sure to, if possible, try out the instruments at the store as each brand of saxophone (whether it is tenor or alto) will have a different feel and slightly different tone when playing. Try out some different mouth pieces as well, don't just play on the plastic mouth piece that you get in the case because it will completely destroy the potential of your sound.     As already mentioned, avoid Rico reeds. Vandoren reeds, I have found, are the most reliable. Also, don't start on anything less than a 2 1/2. Your sound will be weaker and more airy if you start in the 1's or 2's. However, if you find a 2 1/2 is too strong, then going down to a 2 isn't the end of the world.     Best of luck in choosing!    ^___^|`|yjQOeuTGaa	i would say alto because u can get more use out of it. Besides, alto will be a fun challege.|`|lgg7DLy9aa	Both are popular in jazz, so that shouldn't be a concern. The size of the instrument also shouldn't be a concern. Tenor is not necessarily "easier" to play. The tenor you have played might have been a more advanced model, you might have been using a better reed, or a number of factors. I don't exactly know what you mean when you say alto is more popular when it comes down to joining a band. I've also found tenor players are in short, and there are usually less players trying out for less spots. It might just be my area though. Sounds like you have better reasons to play tenor, but Just play them side by side, close your eyes and pick whatever feels the best.|`|vfXFDV8qaa	I would say alto because it's smaller and if you want to join a band....sure!!!! It could be better because then, what if the tenor is too, well, not the right sound with the band? Then you might get your hopes down! Hope this helps!|`|t9T35AkCaa	I was 13 when I joined jazz band.  I played Alto during concert and tenor during jazz. I'd say go for tenor. Tenor is awesome. It has a sweeter sound that alto does. But the supplies (mouthpiece, reeds, etc) costs more.

Iditarod????  The Iditarod is just a sled dog race that re-creates the valant trip made from Anchorage to Nome delivering needed medical supplies.    Alaska had many big gold discoveries in the 1880's and 1890's.  In 1904 Italian prospector Felex Pedro discovered gold in the now Fairbanks area and that began the gold rush of the period you mentioned.    Strange but true - just this week a new gold company has laid claim to a new gold depost about 40 miles north from Felex's original discovery.  They expect to be removing $18-$20 Billion in gold from one small 400 acre area.    Hope this helps
9WuqMoDqaa	Your looking much too litteraly into Stephenie Meyers use of adjectives. When she uses words like stone or marble, she's just trying to get her point across, she never says they are actually made out of that stuff, just trying to say they are extremely tough. No they are not solid, and as far as I know they have no blood, but thats just a coincidence, not because they are solid. Well I guess they would have to have blood because BREAKINGDAWNSPOILERSPOILERSPOILERLOOKAWA... in the beginning of Breaking Dawn Bella gets pregnant, so they do have sperm and...I guess they have blood because...well it seems like you know from what you said in your question. From reading Breaking Dawn, I have discovered that SM has no real writing talent, so I'm not surprised you have these questions. Hope I helped :)    Someone said "bellas period- period blood is not blood. it is vaginal mucus" Stephenie Meyer stated that her period was "dead blood" and therefore didn't attract vampires. And to the males always stay fertile in real life, not true. I don't know if they meant it the way I'm taking it, but a males sperm only stays good for 48 hours after death, so vamps technically shouldn't be able to have babies. SM has no idea what shes doing anymore...|`|JbKerMCkaa	I like Liz's answer the best-- I think she knows the series the best.  Can you anwser my question please ;->    http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|hLxBXX6daa	The male vampires aren't human, but they are men. That's the whole point. Yes they don't cry, but it never stated whether or not they bleed, they just said if the vampire is winning then it wouldn't be hard to finish the other off. I loved all the books, I can't really understand why people would care as long as they enjoyed a good story, I wondered the same question though. I think it doesn't have to make sense, because as an author, I KNOW that authors can make whatever they want to happen. Stephanie said from the beginning, these are not vampires from anything else or a type, they are just her version of what vampires should be.|`|E28mQDX0aa	It's simple... Stephenie Meyer fails at logic and basic biology.     I mean, she has said so herself that the only liquid in a vampire is venom and blood (and that's only if they have recently fed). If that's the case, then there is no way for her vampire males to even get aroused, let alone, get a girl pregnant. The venom can not act as sperm. It makes no logically sense.     Also, Edward is, to put it simply, dead. And he's been that way for awhile. Therefore, it makes absolutely no logical or biological sense that he could get Bella pregnant. His sperm would have died a long time ago. There's no way that they would have lasted the 100+ years. And, since he's dead his body wouldn't even be able to produce any more. Once again, it makes no logical or biological sense at all.    The only reason I'm resorting to biology is because Meyer said so herself that her vampires are more scientific than magical, therefore, the basic laws of biology apply to them.    Also, period blood is no different from the blood that comes out of a cut that one gets on some other part of the body. Therefore, it is not "dead blood".|`|FE4B8uynaa	When SM said stone she didnt mean litterally. There bodies are built so stongly its tough like a roc. Therefor they are not really rocks lol. Vampires do bleed but they can only bleed if hurt by another vampire or wolf. Humans are not strong enough to hurt them.    I think their bodies  are still human like without the human reactions.|`|q1ui0cS0aa	Well i think that the reasons for all the differences is to lure people in to reading it and maybe that is just how stephene sees vampires. for the other questions i dont know. but it might just be there to make the series longer. for a better ending.|`|lnXFAmSaaa	Setphenie Meyer does a good job of explaining the situation of how he can get her pregnant. I forget which chapter, but right after bella realizes she is pregnant she goes through this thought process of facts. It ends up with her stating that she remembers learning about a man in his 70s who still fathered a child. If you reread that you should understand.    They aren't fluidless....they DO have venom. And the rest of their fluids are acidic. Take Bella's eyes for example, they are so acidic they dissolve the contacts.|`|E9KYlG9kaa	Go to stepheniemeyer.com.  It has all the answers.|`|V0IvGsJvaa	I can't explain it but here is Stephenie Meyers' explination.  Go to the Question "Vampires and pregnancy: when did that idea occur to you?

First when they become vampires they are frozen in their current state. Edward could produce sperm because he already had it in him when he was turned. they arnt solid stone either. everything is just frozen pretty much and hardened. they cant cry because they cant produce things they dont have (like tears). they can most likely get aroused like any other male ;-)|`|rmmNS689aa	yo,i know it doesn't sound like it makes sense but it just happens;and yes their insides are stone(i think) and who knows why they can get a girl pregnant but not anything else ask stephanie meyer!oh and they are vegetarian vampires btw|`|c44dIboDaa	well yeah there are different vampires!!  lol..yes..i sort of pretend breaking dawn doesnt exist,,|`|AA10209040	Stephenie Meyer has no grasp of biology whatsoever.

You could also go craigslist in your area or just buy another copy of the book with the dustjacket and sell or donate the one you currently have.    Some people do collect dustjackets for resale, but not a huge market. Still, I know if I have a hardcover I want to keep, I like having the dustjacket. Unfortunately, it appears on Amazon copies of the hardcover are going for good money ($20+), so might not be the best alternative. Maybe you'll find someone willing to part with theirs.

o16Z34u6aa	The Renaissance of the 12th century was a period of many changes during the High Middle Ages. It included social, political and economic transformations, and an intellectual revitalization of Europe with strong philosophical and scientific roots. These changes paved the way to later achievements such as the literary and artistic movement of the Italian Renaissance.    The Italian Renaissance began the opening phase of the Renaissance, a period of great cultural change and achievement in Europe that spanned the period from the end of the 14th century to about 1600, marking the transition between Medieval and Early Modern Europe.
AA10923178	John Brown (1800-1859) was a radical abolitionist. He wanted to put an end to slavery. He helped fugitive slaves escape to Canada.   In 1855, Brown and five of his sons moved to Kansas and worked to prevent it from becoming a slave state. He wanted arms to invade the South and free slaves. He led a raid on the U.S. arsenal at Harpers Ferry on Oct 17, 1859. But it failed and he was captured. He was convicted of treason and hanged on Dec 2, 1859.

Here's the summary:  "Melina Sordino busted an end-of-summer party by calling the cops, so her old friends won't talk to her, and people she doesn't know hate her from a distance. The safest place to be is alone, inside her own head. But even that's not safe. Because there's something she's trying not to think about, something about the night of the party that, if she let in, would blow her carefully constructed disguise to smithereens. And then she would have to speak the truth."    Some reviews:  "Anderson perfectly captures the harsh conformity of high-school cliques and one teen's struggle to find acceptance from her peers. Melinda's sarcastic wit, honestly, and courage make her a memorable character whose ultimate triumph will inspire and empower readers."  --Booklish, starred review    It's a very good book, also interesting.|`|WJUxHXsAaa	eww why would you wanna read a book in the first place???|`|g7fPDmmxaa	Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card is a good one.

Make the reader feel sorry for the freaky boy, or, hate him right away. Make the story stand out on the shelf. There are tons of books similar to this one, so you need to make this one special. I think it could be a great story|`|bAhIkiMLaa	Sorry, but it's not very original...|`|rmmNS689aa	no offense but it kinda sounds like aa FEW books that i've read.  try something more fantasy like for instance the girl he falls in love with is a witch or something =]|`|eBZtV35saa	omg it would make a great story!!   i wish you would have put more but oh well  it sounds like a very interesting book i would read it.

OhWmu0R3aa	She did earn her nickname; and earn it well.    Admittedly there were other Tudor monarchs who could be equally unpleasant to religious dissenters, but Mary I succeeded in arresting (usually on the flimsiest of charges), torturing and executing more Protestants than, say, Elizabeth I did Catholics. She also managed to do it in a shorter period of time.    Mary also reintroduced the medieval heresy laws shortly after the reconciliation ceremony with Rome in november 1554 which permitted the use of burning as a method of execution leading to the deaths of 283 Protestant martyrs, 56 of them women, between february 1555 and november 1558. It was this, plus the blindings, facial disfiguring, stranglings, rackings, pressings and disembowelments that gave rise to her nickname "Bloody" Mary within her own lifetime.|`|bdnMQnVHaa	Only about 300 protestants were executed during her reign, so compared to Hitler or Stalin, Bloody Mary is kind of unfair.|`|3QsPl1uLaa	Yes she does. Elizabeth l actually had more people killed than Mary but did not get "bloody" attached to her name.|`|WELHdIjFaa	violent mary or cruel mary would seem to fit better|`|d13be469790f4c6de2d7eb7872dee476aa	The number of people she had killed during her reign would have been a slow day for Oliver Cromwell, so no.
k8AcVixTaa	Get a good color head enlarger if you can find one cheap.  That way you can dial in the filtration for the contrast when using multigrade paper.  I have three.  I have a Durst, an Omega C700 and one off brand.  I bought mine for $65, $10, and $45.      Otherwise most black and white enlargers for 35mm are about the same though I favor the Beseler 23C which can take 35mm and 120 size negs.  Its not the enlarger that makes the print but the quality of the lens.    My primary black and white enlarger is an Omega D4 which takes a 4x5 negative as I shoot mainly with a 4x5 view camera.      Too bad you weren't in my area as I could make you a heck of a deal on one.  Email me with your city and I can see what shipping would run.  Maybe I can help you out.

4ab39422c7923ec245fd8bc42df199c9aa	I really like the detail that you put into your question. I think what your feeling is Existential Angst. You feel angry at all the frivolous musings and movements of humanity. You look at us and see just a fluke in the movings of nature that just so happens to be smart enough to make cars and ipods. So be it. But if you believe in God, then you might have to wonder whether we have a better and more devine purpose in life. If we were put here for a reason. That is an answer no one can give you. That you must find on your own.    If you don't believe in God, then you are going to have to come to terms with that too and try and grasp just what exactly that means. No one is there to save you, no one is there to care for you, no one is there to listen to you scream in the night. It's just you and the void. But the one thing that this does give you is the ability to perceive things as your own. It is not the governments, your families, your friends or God's decision to do what you do. It's yours. You have the power to be you. You get lost in the world of everyone else and you forget what is most fundamentally important. Existence comes before essence. You can control what you do with your life. Never let anyone take that away from you and realize that this is the only thing that ever really matters in this world...    If you find God, so be it.|`|0gCfxj2Qaa	Well I don't think humans are better than the thousands of other species that inhabit the earth. I agree that we have a false sense of superiority. I don't understand why anyone would ask the question of why to pursue life. Life can be amazing for anybody, but only you have the power to make it amazing.|`|AhO0Uoppaa	too much to read, ummm call the police?|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Consider a cosmic view of life over your present understandings.      The Universal Father has poured out himself, as it were, to make all creation rich in personality possession and potential spiritual attainment. God has given us himself that we may be like him, and he has reserved for himself of power and glory only that which is necessary for the maintenance of those things for the love of which he has thus divested himself of all things else.    5. THE ETERNAL AND DIVINE PURPOSE              There is a great and glorious purpose in the march of the universes through space. All of your mortal struggling is not in vain. We are all part of an immense plan, a gigantic enterprise, and it is the vastness of the undertaking that renders it impossible to see very much of it at any one time and during any one life. We are all a part of an eternal project which the Gods are supervising and outworking. The whole marvelous and universal mechanism moves on majestically through space to the music of the meter of the infinite thought and the eternal purpose of the First Great Source and Center.              The eternal purpose of the eternal God is a high spiritual ideal. The events of time and the struggles of material existence are but the transient scaffolding which bridges over to the other side, to the promised land of spiritual reality and supernal existence. Of course, we mortals find it difficult to grasp the idea of an eternal purpose; we are virtually unable to comprehend the thought of eternity, something never beginning and never ending. Everything familiar to us has an end.|`|Ii3Cd5OOaa	Get away from your parents just as soon as possible|`|MNqwUHypaa	I agree, one must have a driving motive.

(AP) --  You have got to be lucky to make $4 Billion killing on a 6-month investment of $124 Million Larry Silverstein is the New York property tycoon who purchased the entire WTC complex just 6 months prior to the 9/11 attacks. That was the first time in its 33-year history the complex had EVER changed ownership. Mr. Silversteins first order of business as the new owner was to change the company responsible for the security of the complex. The new security company he hired was Securacom (now Stratasec). George W. Bush's brother, Marvin Bush, was on its board of directors, and Marvins cousin, Wirt Walker III, was its CEO. According to public records, not only did Securacom provide electronic security for the World Trade Center, it also covered Dulles International Airport and United Airlines, two key players in the 9/11 attacks.    The company was backed by an investment firm, the Kuwait-American Corp., also linked for many years to the Bush family. KuwAm has been linked to the Bush family financially since the Gulf War. One of its principals and a member of the Kuwaiti royal family, Mishal Yousef Saud al Sabah, served on the board of Stratesec.                    Follow the money.    (Don't call me "Lucky!"

In 1844 she married John Tubman, but they soon seperated.  When her owner died in 1849 and she was threatened with sale to the Deep South, she escaped to Philadelphia.  In December 1850 she returned to Baltimore and helped her sister and two children to escape, fetching her brother's family in 1851.  She became active in the 'Undergournd Railway' helping up to 300 fugitive slaves to reach the northern states and Canada.    During the early 1850s she lived in Ontario where she acted as adviser to John Brown, but in 1858 she moved to Auburn, New York, where she also settled her parents who had been rescued from the South.  She became a noted speaker in the abolitonist and women's rights movements, and during the Civil War worked as a cook, laundress, spy and scout for the Union Army.  In 1869 she married Nelson Davies and worked with him founding freedmen schools, teaching and preaching.  A deeply religious, energetic activist, she also founded a home for elderly black people in Auburn.

376abf017f5ceda0dc7a5f6414b42db2aa	You should try it! I did, and believe me, I did NOT regret it. It's a great series. :)    So... without giving too much away...    Rose Hathaway is a dhampir - half vampire, half human. Her body is sturdy like a human's. The sun doesn't bother her, and she doesn't need to drink blood. But her vampire qualities are what make her strong and fast, and so able to take care of and protect her best friend Lissa. Lissa Dragomir is Moroi - a mortal vampire - and she is a princess, and the last of her royal bloodline. She needs to be protected at all times from the Strigoi -  the undead vampires that woud love to make her part of their undead ranks.    Fear made Rose and Lissa run away from their private school two years ago, but they've been caught. Rose must continue her education if she wants to be able to become a Guardian and protect Lissa after high school. But just because they're confined within the protective walls of St Vlad's, how can they be so sure that they are actually safe?    Okay, so that was my lame attempt at a description of the book. lol But it's a good series. Frostbite (book 2) and Shadow Kiss (book 3) are sooo good too. :)  Check this link out for a better description: http://www.richellemead.com/vampireacade...    I love this series!! Book 1 was good, but the story gets way better in books 2 and 3. I read VA back in December/January and immediately I had to go out and buy the other books. Rose is a really sassy character. She always seems to be defying her teachers and every other authority figure. Except Dimitri. I don't want to ruin anything for you, but Dimitri is an important character. Very, very important. You'll learn to love him. Actually, it won't even be that hard. lol
JhvqUvlsaa	Yay! OUT OF DEBT! That is one of our resolutions this year; and it's painstakingly slow making it happen on our income.

Katahdin in Maine and run road races in any city in the US, and not have to worry about the cost of travel (if I was fit enough to race that is).  It would also change our nest egg; we'd actually have one lol. And when we retire, we'd be able to live off of something substantial and continue to travel and have a wonderful retirement.  My parents; I would give some to them too. I've always thought that we should if we did come into some money. They have done so much for us. :)  And I should have mentioned this first but we'd give a large sum to charity as well. At least 10%.

WJLl0d3Jaa	Photography preferably at an art school or somewhere with a good program. Also depends on what sort of photographer you wish to become.    Although, like I constantly repeat, go for a normal major that'll help you get hired at a normal job. You can always take photography as a minor or just as a course at a local community college.    Use your money you earn from your normal job to pay for gear, etc. This kid flamed me the other day, saying I don't know much about photography- and I don't, I'm no pro.

The d40 is a great entry level for no skill to pro, but heck if you know all the ins of and outs to photography and getting around on the camera just head to to the higher models.    I use the d40 and it's great for my amateur needs :D|`|uXHnwqxjaa	There are CONSTANT upgrades.  If you like get.  Be sure, there will be a new one a few months down the road.

So I'd say get this one.... don't worry about a new upgrade, til maybe 2 or 3 have been released.|`|6584a2c112e4342d61a5a55cbb9aafd0aa	There will always be a new/upgrade coming out at some point. Nikon will continue to improve and upgrade their product offerings as the technology improves and expands. That being said the D40 has to some degree pretty much been replaced with the advent of the D40x and the D60. Not sure what's next on the entry level side of things, but it's still a pretty good camera at a reasonable price relatively speaking.

Vz5KyAbCaa	Yes, especially if the mother has unresolved emotional issues which would just about always be the case. The new speak in this area calls it  emotional intelligence. A major trauma as a child or young adult can bring emotional evolution to a screeching halt. So can extensive abuse of some heavy drugs or alcohol. I have both professional & personal experience in this area also. it is always difficult for the child when they reach & then pass the parents emotional maturity level.|`|pS02JGTUaa	i think it is, especially if the parent has some sort of addiction or a spouse that means more than their kids.    it seems like most teen moms, after their kids grow up a bit, they try to relive their teen years and thats when they're mostly immature|`|YmtNel5haa	I work in pediatrics, and I can tell you that not only is it possible, but it happens more frequently than you might imagine.|`|AA10405438	Definitely.

They basically indulge themselves in the pleasures of this hedonistic twenty-first century civilization. I have warned them on a few occasions that their way of life is wrong. They are living blindly, influenced by the materialistic way of life in this society. I have told them that they should think about why they are here, life and death. However, my dad said that since we are here, we should basically enjoy ourselves. It doesn't make any sense to me. Can't they see that it is meaningless? What will they get out of what they have earned when death is bestowed upon them? People these days are so ignorant.

So overall i think that it does happen. However it also depend s on the circumstance of both mother and child|`|hG9e4nNLaa	Quite possibly.  I know a woman who adopted her daughter.  Before this, her daughter took care of her father and she was only 4.  She cooked and cleaned, while he sat around.    Quite possible.|`|AA11951392	I see these days that the children are way more mature then the parents     I see it as the children come into the world as the "teachers, teacher" we all learn from each other well it should be like that, a lot fail not understanding the lesson I guess         Love & Blessings   Milly

rxqZ1nLgaa	Im self taught in piano and saxophone :) you don't need to shell out loads to learn an instrument.  However seen as you are 17 you may benefit from getting lessons as you might find it slightly more difficult now than you would have done when you were younger because your fingers will not be used to moving in the ways that will be required for piano and saxophone.  That said, although you may find it slightly more difficult than you would have done when you were younger maybe, it doesn't mean you wouldn't be able to do it. Go for it and see were it takes you!   For saxophone, it may benefit you to practice learning a recorder first. It may not be as exciting but then it will give you a bit of practice in reading music and learning the placement of your fingers before you buy an instument because you may even find that its not your thing!  If you do decide to teach yourself there are some great music books you can buy (my first saxophone etc etc). Im pretty sure they sell them on amazon. :)  Good luck|`|eGI5s8R5aa	It is never too late to learn. If you are 17, the likelihood that you will become a virtuoso and go on to play at Carnegie Hall is rather slim. . .however, if you get a dedicated and patient teacher and you fully commit to practicing several times a week, you could easily learn piano at 17.  Also keep in mind that if you learn piano, it will be so much easier to learn other instruments at a later time.   How easily you "pick it up" is completely dependent on how hard you are willing to work and how knowledgeable your instructor is. Speaking as a former piano instructor (and a one time piano student who started rather late) I would not recommend attempting to teach yourself if you plan to be taken seriously.|`|yiidhHOXaa	its never to late !  im teaching my self saxophone , i play piano and other things but ive found it allot easier learning this time around cause i have the knowledge and more understanding of music and sound.it might be easier to learn if u have other Instruments to take ex-sample of?  um get some good adult beginner books maybe ones with cd's and practise when you feel like it .you don't piratically need a teacher but if you are starting out on music in generally it might help, they can teach you how to read and breathe and stuff,    good luck|`|4JppzNYeaa	It's never too late!  However, if you do want to learn both instruments, atleast get lessons for sax because that would be very difficult to learn by yourself.|`|iGfNQoX3aa	It's never to late to learn.  But be aware the older you get the more your brain is going to analyse what it learns rather than just accept this.  To get beyond this, adults tend to have to practise more than children to get the internal aspects of playing to become natural.     Adults tend to be more disciplined with their practicing, so that sometimes works in their favor.  Just be prepared that learning with the saxephone or piano is going to take effort - but well worth it.      I didn't start until I was 44, but play rather well now.|`|5lmC19GLaa	its never to late to lern to play a instrument.    im 16 and learning the guitar.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Teaching yourself isn't going to be much use. Can't you get piano lessons?    But you can certainly start much later than 17. My daughter started age 7 and is now 12. A lady my age (mid 30s) started from scratch at the same time as she did. This Easter they are both doing grade 6.|`|m01ijLFUaa	Go ahead.  I would thoroughly recommend lessons though.  :D|`|capCtdkeaa	never too late, Chris Rea picked the guitar up at about 30 and had several hits|`|hUYaaXBvaa	get a teacher, they will help you learn to count etc  its not too late  even my mom wants to learn  you just have to be dedicated and you'll improve|`|10knD5g0aa	it is never too late and if i were you i would learn both.. by the time you've learned one it'll be easier to learn the other.. never too late tho
gW0nD5cEaa	It had been getting weak because of leaders who were decedent and cared more about their own lives than those of the people of the empire. They had everything, for a long time there was very little in the way of war and then the people on the outside of the empire, or barbarians, started to invade.     Chrisitianity may have been slightly to blame because of a pacifist view, but as we know through most of western history, "Love thy neighbor" did not prevent lots of wars in Europe and other Christian countries. There were probably a lot of reasons for the decline, Christianity was probably not the cause, but as Emperors and leaders got a little less strong, they may have let Christians have more freedom of  religion and not persecute them as much as previously. .|`|llTqn0Tbaa	even before that, it was starting to get weak  like any major empire, the more you have, the harder its to protect  they had to protect a vast amount of land and people  it would be a matter of time before it would be too much of a responsibility on them|`|pWA3gybAaa	it was already in decay by that time, the empire had been contracting for hundreds of years, Christianity had nothing to do with it, their government became ineffective against the constant barbarian attacks|`|AA11865450	Christianity really had nothing to do with it. the facts were that by this time, the empire simply could not continue to support itself, its armies were made up of conqueored peoples, and the barbarians either had to deal with rome or deal with the Huns. Not to mention the constant political infighting between the two empires after the split
7VpDEkC6aa	Most of these people are giving you pretty good advice.  If you have musical ability , then it won't be too difficult. If you don't have "guitar" ability it will be difficult.    Some people will never be able to play a guitar, no matter how hard they try or want to. All instruments take a different set of skills. I've known some really great guitar players who have absolutely ZERO ability to keep a beat either by clapping their hands or playing a drum.Truly pitiful to watch them try. Bad guitar players sometimes mistakenly believe that they could play bass. They are WRONG. If you suck on guitar you will suck at bass.    I say this not to discourage you, but to encourage you. If you find that guitar is not for you, try other instruments like drums, or keyboards.    That being said, one person was actually somewhat correct.....A steel string acoustic is actually "harder" to play than an electric. Electric guitars have much easier steel strings to play. and the strings are usually closer to the fretboard than an acoustic.    They are played with the same fingers and chords and everything soit really depends on what kind of music you want to play.    The best guitar to "learn" on would be a nylon stringed classical guitar, since the strings are very soft and eay to play and they are much thicker, so they are easier for a beginner to learn proper fingering technique. And the neck is wider so your fingers don't stumble over each other as much when learning to switch chords.    But if you want to learn on an electric, that's OK, too.    The Squier Strat pack is a good beginning set of equipment. You get everything you'd need to play the guitar, except lessons. It comes with a tuner and a strap, and a guitar bag and all the other stuff you'd need to have.   If you get a squier strat, make sure to have the guitar store set up the whammy bar for you. They come from the factory unadjusted to prevent damage.  If you don't, you'll have to do it yourself, it's not hard, but it helps to have some guitar knowledge when you are doing it. You can download the set up procedures from Fender.com.    Many people don't realize this and their whammy bars only work in one direction.    However at first you won't be needing the whammy bar, that's for more advanced playing.  If you can't take lessons, then go online as google "guitar lesson" there are tons of video lessons for beginning players. they aren't the best way to learn, but it's a lot more than I had growing up and learning to play. I didn't have the internet or DVD's  or any of the modern ways to learn.    Avoid learning guitar by reading TABS.  Those are for learning songs, not to learn how to play guitar. Learn chords and scales and what notes are on the fretboard, and then practice them. After you get the basics down, you can play songs by reading the chords above the lyrics and not with Tabs.   I learned just about every song I know by ear or  sometimes with a song book.  If you know your guitar, you can sound out songs by yourself and won't need Tabs.     It does take time to learn, don't expect to be able to rock out your favorite songs right away. You will get discouraged. Remember that you must learn to crawl before you can walk. Be patient and the rewards will be that much better. And you will blow the doors off the TAB players.  When I was 15 I was a better player than you could imagine. But I started playing when I was 8. I was playing paid gigs at 17. So be patient.   Those tab guys I would pay NOT to listen to, frankly. Because they don't really KNOW their instrument.    So do go ahead get a nice starter pack and go slowly and you will find later on (hopefully)  How fun it can be to be able to play music and make your own music just by knowing your scales and chords.    Good luck to you.|`|nVWi6A9Saa	Treat lecky and acoustic guitars as two totally different instruments. If ya wanna learn acoustic, learn acoustic, and if ya wanna learn lecky, learn lecky, but never the twain to meet, me old son! Be lucky! :)|`|moeaIZB9aa	its ok|`|TsFG4zLmaa	my son has an electric guitar, and just got an accoustic for christmas.  he is 10 years old, and he loves it.  start out with a cheap one for now in case you don't really get into it.  work your way up to a good one.  take lessons.  My son also goes on the internet and looks up guitar chords.    good luck!!|`|LWbfPPCvaa	its pretty easy. find some good songs to start with, i personally choose metallica cuz i love them, go get some guitar tabs online, and get an ibanez. these guitars have a great tone. do start with an electric because acoustic guitars are much harder to play. Oh and get a line 6 spyder amp.|`|capCtdkeaa	its a great instrument to start off on, and easier than some, although like all instruments it requires a bit of personal discipline and as much practise as you want to throw at it,  there are so many teach yourself books/cds/websites etc, you may not need a teacher at all, but it is fun to learn with a mate or two as well.  as for a good one to start with, i would say make sure its good quality, as if it is crap it will only put you off playing it.  the Fender Squire range are good balance of value and quality, and the Stratocaster or Telecaster models are both great. your best bet is to go to your best local music shop and have a chat with the guy, sit and hold them both, get the guy to explain the differences (ie one has a trem, one doesnt). It also depends on the kind of music you want to learn, but that is a good place to start.|`|27gnpuxwaa	kind of, i would suggest learning an acoustic one first|`|4sK0aJlDaa	NOT AT ALL IF YOU HAVE MUSICAL ABILITY|`|t4FBtIsTaa	Depends if you have any natural talent and an ear for music. I have both so can play loads of things really well and find easy to learn.|`|999ec6b4b5d9115e12982e55d0e8287daa	well, you should start slowly and work your way up. get a beginners book. LESSONS!!! make it so much easier. good guitar to start with, i got a fender strat beginner setup thing. it comes with all the needed stuff. and its pretty good.  ive been playing guitar for about a year now. still using that fender strat. pretty decent guitar for a beginner|`|SMVsmzi4aa	u should learn to play acoustic first, it makes it easier wen u move onto electric, get a fender strat if u really wann start off wit electric guitar. peace|`|dsN4EQjGaa	Its hard to learn but if youve got loads of time free you should try, ive found myself in the same situation and am trying to learn. Ive got a Fender Squire its been ok for me!|`|s0T9p9Araa	The guitar like other instrument is a hard instrument to play. Even though its difficult, it is fun to play. I started teaching myself to play about a year ago and I'm not as good as Slash but i'm getting there. If you truly want to learn you have to practice at least every day and know the basics of music theory (chords, music notes or tabs, timing, arpeggios, bending). It also depends what type of music you want to play. Most heavy metal and rock songs are hard to learn.   Its up to you if think you dedicate some time to learn. I would suggest you get lessons in the beginning.   Also try downloading guitar pro 5 to help learn how to play some songs on guitar.  If you want a good guitar start off with an Epiphone Les Paul  or a Fender Squier Stratocaster. Both are cheap and have great sounding quality.|`|LFbnkXi3aa	It really depends on what you want to do with it. If you're just looking to play for yourself and learn songs, it's not really that hard. It will generally take you a few months to start getting your fingers to work with the fretboard.    Usually, in the beginning it will be hard but you have to keep practising. You also never mentioned whether or not you wanted to learn to read music. There are always tabs too. These are much more straight-forward to beginners if you have no previous musical experience. I am not saying to never learn how to read music, it's just if you want to start playing songs quicker, tabs will do that for you.    I would suggest looking into a $300-500 dollar guitar to see if you even like playing guitar. Most guitars in that range are okay for beginners, and will be sufficient until you develop more skill. That being said, if you like guitar, I would then suggest investing in a $1000+ guitar later on. You can feel the difference between a Gibson Les Paul versus the Fender Squire...    Anyways, not trying to bash Fender by any means, just going from experience. But yeah, look into Gibson, Fender, Schecter, Ibanez. There are other great brands out there but these all offer okay beginner guitars, as well as nice guitars for later on.    Good luck and have fun.|`|R2PaqlByaa	It is hard, but with a load of practice you get better, if you're patient...  A good guitar to start off with is a Squier or a Stagg..|`|Endztu9Xaa	it will be very hrd|`|5QF6n2g7aa	its hard but you can start with an acoustic guitar|`|voHBvhLiaa	i just started its easy just need practice

sQsl1r5Yaa	When America's involvement in World War II began, Duke tried to enlist but was rejected due to a combination of an old football injury, his age (he was 34), and his married, father of four status. Duke was so dejected he even flew to directly to Washington to ask to be allowed to join the Navy - but was turned down.    Since he couldn't go fight abroad, he decided to do his part at home, and dedicated himself to the war effort by making inspirational war films - including 1942's "Flying Tigers", and 1945's "Back to Bataan". To all Americans, he became the true symbol of the American fighting man.    Besides the war in Europe, Duke also fought against Communism in his backyard. In the 1940s, Duke was one of the most notable stars to come out against the supposed Communist conspiracy in Hollywood. With others, he helped form the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals. With fellow actors like Barbara Stanwyck and Robert Taylor, Duke sought to challenge the Hollywood Communists.

EU8EkDJaaa	Women played a big role actually. They were a part of the popular movements.    A woman murdered Marat.    The Sans Coulottes were often run by women.    Women were granted equality in the Declaration of Rights of Man and Citizen.|`|NYU37jfGaa	Women from artisan and lower-middle-class families, who were prepared to agitate over economic and political matters, were prominent in riots and mass movements from the beginning of the Revolution.    As small traders, family managers and often sole providers, they also took the lead, consistently and frequently, in small-scale actions, denouncing rising prices and forcing shopkeepers to adhere to government price-fixing on essential products like grain, soap, and salt.    As conditions worsened, economic issues were inceasingly politicized by middle-class activisits such as Pauline Leon and the actress Claire Lacombe, who pointed out the conflict between the economic differences in French society and the Revolution's promise of poltical and legal equality.  The Society of Revolutionary Republican Women which they founded in May 1793, and which favoured egalitarian policies, became the object of suspicion of trhe Committees of Public Safety and General Security, which closed it down in October 1793.    The militant middle-class women of the Revolution failed in their major aim of winning political equality with men.  Denied the right to vote, their sole political advance in those years had been in matters of divorce and inheritance granted by the new regime's law codes.    There was less in the Revolution for women than for men, and this may have been one factor behind Charlotte Corday's fateful action.  charlotte Corday decided that she could save France from the 'anarchist leader' Marat, and on 13 July she visited him at his house in Paris and stabbed him with a kitchen knife that she had bought earlier that day.  She believed her action would save France from the extremists.    One woman who had a remarkable time during the French Revolution was Marie Grosholtz (afterwards world-famous as Madame Tussaud).  She had been apprenticed to Dr Curtius who had a waxwork show, and had learned to make lifelike wax images of people. She had at one time taught art to Princess Elizabeth, the sister of the King of France, and had been closely associated with the royal family.  During the Revolution, she continued to make waxworks and her show remained very popular, but she found herself now obliged to make wax images from the severed heads of people who had been her friends.  She kept her nerve though, and managed to survive the Revolution and take her famous waxwork show to London, where it still remains 200 years later.
bdnMQnVHaa	Germany, France and Great Britain did not have any direct cause to enter World War I.  One reason why they did so was because they had made alliances with either Austria or Russia.|`|N86vHKxtaa	Alliances made small, local problems into international crises since whenever one member of an alliance took issue with a non-member nation, it automatically involved the other alliance members in the dispute.  Hence, a relatively insignificant assassination in Serbia ignites war as alliance members square off behind their partners.    Also, because the armed forces of the major alliance members (on both sides) had very different levels of modernization, it took different lengths of time to mobilize for war.  Once you start mobilizing, you can't stop and your enemy is obliged to respond which triggers the mobilization of other members of that alliance to also mobilize.  The final result is everyone poised for war and the smallest error sets it all off.
gW0nD5cEaa	Many people consider the 10 commandments the basis for American law, that is sometimes  debated. But the basic laws, "THou Shalt not Kill", Thou Shalt not Steal" etc are basic parts of our and just about any religion and/or government philosophy.     ANd of course the 10 Commandments are part of what Christians call the Old Testament, and the part of the Old Testament Jews call the Torah. Many other laws possibly have roots directly or indirectly from the Bible, including the Old Testament. ANd most of the New Testament, except possibly Luke was written by Jewish writers, so just about anything that has a biblical origin, is "Jewish".    Many other factors, ANglo saxon laws, ENglish common law, the Magna Carta, all have part in modern law, but the Bible is in there to some degree.|`|KfptxDDtaa	Actually many people say the French invented Democracy.

There is no relationship between Jewish law and US and English Common law.  There is little or no relationship between Roman Law and English Common Law.  The only real carry over from Roman Law was the use of Latin which you will find in certain legal documents, etc. Latin, however, was the Lingua Franca of Intelligensia and that is the only reason it continues in any importance.      English Common Law has its roots in Nordic Law, the law of the Norwegian Vikings.  Had it gotten its main impetus from the Anglo-Saxon heritage, we would be having trials by ordeal.  The best part of the Scandanavian Law would have come over with William D. Conquerer.  The Normans of France were only displaced Vikings.      Trial by jury is a Scandanavian feature.  I beseech you to read some of the Icelandic Sagas where you will find specific mentions of Nordic Law.  The one that comes to mind first is NJAL'S SAGA which is available in paperback and is used extensively in law schools across the nation.      Both Iceland and Norway had legislatures.  In Iceland, it was the Althing and in Norway, it was the Thing.  It was monocameral.  Law courts were held regularly at specific places  where all cases that were to come to before the law were tried.  You can call those circuit courts, if you want.      Most history teachers and Civics teachersdon't know this stuff, they only know the myth and rumor that is foisted upon them in the schools that they attended.  It takes a peculiar breed, a Medievalist, to tell you.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	In the US and in UK Commonwealth countries very little.    Modern law pretty much followed a route from Roman Law through English Law.

0TtBzK4Vaa	What I remember from my history class was there was a terrible depression after WW1 and everyone was miserable and starving.  But the Jewish people were very successful in their business practices and compared to everyone else were wealthy, well fed, had nice homes and beautiful art. Hitler wanted the Art, and he needed a cause so he got people to follow him by saying it was the fault of the Jewish People that everyone was starving and living in poverty.  He was able to expand on the Aryan race thing too because it was the opposite of the stereotypical Jewish appearance. I'm just giving you a very quick synopsis from memory.  It's a great question.|`|UuQAPHJtaa	Because they were different. It started in the middle ages-jews were skilled and smart, thus more wealthy than most. When they wouldn't convert to catholic, they became scapegoats, they were blamed for natural disasters, disease, and the peoples problems. People believed that jews where responsible for the death of jesus, and god was punishing the world for this. I really understand how you feel when you read about the holocaust, and i really hope it never happens again. Alot of germans were against what hitler was doing, but did nothing to stop it for fear of death of themselves or their families. They were also told that the jews were free and well cared for in their own separate part of town (germans did not like the word "ghetto", they said they were more humane than that) when, actually this was a lie. They had the jews pretend to have fun and enjoy themselves while they filmed it for the other citizens.   Not all the germans hate jews, and hitler was a bad representative of germany. I think that the jews do harbor some hatred toward the germans, but not all of them-even the holocaust survivors themselves.     I am not jewish, in fact i am over 80% german, and i live in america. my grandfather's family left germany at the beginning of 1938.     Here are some good sites if you are interested in more about the Holocaust.    http://www.isurvived.org/  http://www.nizkor.org/  http://remember.org/educate/medexp.html    Never Forget    ...Hi Feisty. I remember you.|`|ea2395751480a69caa92c51b9cfe1156aa	I think that Germany has worked very hard for decades to atone for and live down the shame of the holocaust. It is perhaps the only country in the world where holocaust denial is a jailable offence. There is no simple answer to this question, certainly the things that you described happened, there were far too many surviving witnesses for them to be fiction. You must remember, though this is an explanation not a defence, that after World War 1 Germany was terribly humiliated and plunged into an era of poverty almost unimaginable to us. When Hitler came along, he seemed like a God to them, he gave them back their national pride, he gave them work, put food on their tables, rebuilt their armies, made them feel like a great nation again, so when he told them something they believed him totally, and when he said that the Jews were the root of all evil they never questioned it.    Oddly enough, despite this barbarity toward the Jews and some others, when it came to warfare they applied the Geneva convention  to allied prisoners rigidly. My own father was a POW for four years and never complained about the treatment he received. Very rarely did this behaviour slip and only because of orders from higher up, such as the massacre of the escapees after the great escape.    I think it is almost impossible for us to understand the mindset of a German of the 1930s. What they did was terrible, the Nazis are perhaps the greatest evil that has ever existed, but the reasons for their rise are complex and numerous. They chose to follow a madman because he gave them what they wanted, and I have no doubt that many still alive from those times will still remember him with affection. His regime, though barbaric, was one of the most efficient in the history of politics. He changed the face of the world and the way we saw humanity. To blame modern Germans for the sins of their fathers would be totally wrong, unlike Japan they have admitted their crimes and tried to make amends.|`|xfqHi1tRaa	As usual, a question such as this posted up here gets not so great to absolutely horrible answers. It draws out the crazies (revisionists) and the just plain misinformed.    My suggestion to you to better understand this topic is to do some reading on your own. Start at the U.S. Holocaust Museum website. It's very interactive and easy to understand, it presents the issues well and give you guides for further study.    http://www.ushmm.org/    If you want a more advance reading, try Hitler's Willing Executioners.

This gave something for the German people to focus out and vent their anger and supposedly feel better about themselves. They were made to be the scapegoats of history - paving the way for the Third Reich - a rise which depended on the power of propaganda put out by Dr Goebbls.    The original fate of the Jews was supposedly deportation to the island of Madagascar - effectively a large open prison. After the conference at Wannasee in 1942 it was determined that Hitler's real intention was the holocaust - descibed as 'the Final Solution'.    It could be argued that Jews never really fully assimilated into German society and thus made themselves stand out and an easy target. Their dress and customs set them apart from the mainstream and their reputation for success in business made them the target of envy. To some Gentiles they had committed the ultimate crime of delivering the Messiah into the hands of the Romans - although most people overlook the fact that Jesus Christ was a Jew.     There were lots of racial theories put forward by the Nazis (the basis of the Nuremberg Laws) and that Jews (and Slavs) were sub-human. Of course, it takes a particular type of person to go along with all this - unfortunately the Nazis were able to find enough to make Hitlers' vision in his book Mein Kampf - the destruction of European Jewry - (almost) a reality.Many were tried and executed after the war for Crimes against Humanity - but many were not.    You will get a better idea of what it was all about by Googling the site of the Holocaust Meorial museum at Yad Vashem - and be prepared for odd reactions to your question on this site.|`|nxrEuJsRaa	Careful propaganda and powerful orating by Hitler turned Germans against Jews.Jews were successful so Hitler prayed on this and suggested that Jews stole German jobs, so the seed of hatred was sown. And with evil bullying by the SS it is no surprise that depressed Germany was taken in, scary indeed.    I would say I dislike Germans who are interviewed and talk about their war crimes,like camp guards, and captains close to Hitler, and they feel no remorse whatsoever for believing it and actually either signing death warrants or doing the deed themselves.   I try not to be prejudice as that is not helpful.But its a period in the past we must never forget.|`|DIlNnjf8aa	Q. what did the jews do to make the germans want to kill them?    A. Nothing whatsoever. They were made scapegoats for everything wrong in the German society, just as Muslims today are blamed for everything.      Q. do people still hate the germans today for what they did?    A. No, because the Holocaust victims did not do what they should have honorably done and that was to have made Germany carve out a homeland for all of them and evacuate all non-Jewish Germans from such a homeland. Instead, they went after Palestine, of all places, and misdirected the anger that should have been aimed at the Germans into anger against the Palestinians.    And so the cycle of violence continues.|`|gW0nD5cEaa	There are probably a lot of explanations, but none that work.     German people, who are usually very intelligent, and had been among the leaders in science and medicine for centuries, seemed to be fooled by this mad man. It is something I wondered about for years. But Germans are taught to be very obiedient and follow their leaders. (I don't mean a game) Not to question authority, although most German Americans are very independent.     If somebody was a little anti-semitic but did not really care one way or another, maybe did not know any Jews or other 'different' people, were told "Jews are bad" they are to blame for this or that, or that Germany lost WWI, or that the banks failed or whatever, people were willing to except it. Why after 9/11, did so many people in the US who had never hated Muslims before, start blaming them for all kinds of things? And we had been attacked. Jewish people did not attack Germany. They were very much a part of German culture, more in Germany than some Eastern European countries. It is hard to say why so many went along with Hitler against them.     Then there were a large majority, no  matter how they felt about Jewish people, who I do not believe knew about the camps. A person my family knew who was a small child in Germany at the time said, she or at least her mother and grandparents knew about the Camp (Dachau) but it was a prison. No different than if there is a prison near you. It is bad people. Bad people go to prison. They, at least the children did not know and I don't know exactly what a lot of German adults knew. Especially after the war started, they were trying to survive and let their kids survive.     That is not excusing the horrible, horrible acts of the Nazis and I don't think anybody can explain it. Nor can I explain the Genocide in Rwanda, the genocide in the Balkans in the 1990's, the lynchings, etc. of American Blacks or the genocide of Native AMericans. Some people are just killers and when they are given a chance to do it legally, they go for it. Psychopaths, Sociopaths, etc. worked for Hitler. Many should have been in mental institutions but were given jobs in camps.     Never forget is the only thing to say.|`|2z1h5mfOaa	I don't quite agree with "bloggers".  The Jews did nothing wrong, indeed, but he needn't make a comparison to Muslims etc. even if I can see why.    Also, it wasn't the Germans who decided where to make a state for the Jews, it was the Allies who decided this, possibly under pressure from a strong lobby of Jews demanding their own country - fair enough - but it's not the German's fault.  Jews were not liked for many reasons, and part of this was because they are good and sharp business people.  The main reason was that Hitler wanted to cleanse the German state of anyone who was not of the Arian race, and this included not just Jews, but also gypsies / Romanies, and anyone else who didn't quite fit the bill of "decent" citizens.  In the 1960s and 70s there were the Nurenburg trials who brought to justice a number of Nazi's but not everyone guilty of cooperating in the holocaust was caught and tried.    I am in close contact with German people and I can tell you that a lot of Germans feel ashamed and distraught about what their country did.  Obviously there are people still alive who suffered, or whose families suffered, and they may feel hatred towards the Germans, not surprisingly.|`|AA11304025	There is a long history of persecution of the jews in Europe by the Christians because they accuse them of being responsible for the death of Christ which is a bit strange because without that there would be no Christianity.  Also the jews refused to assimilate into the general population because they consider themselves God's Chosen People and therefore superior to all other races . Marrying people from other races is considered shameful, a bit like a white woman marrying a black man some years ago.  This made them easy targets for the Nazis who blamed them for the German defeat during WW1.  But don't fall into the trap of thinking that it was only the Germans involved.  Wherever they went they found people in other countries who were prepared to help them in eliminating the jews.  It was one reason why they put all the extermination camps in Poland because the Poles being Roman Catholic had a long history of hatred for the jews.

A loss of sovereignty with the loss of WW1 in 1918 and the need to rebuild a nation, which led to the rise of fascism and a distorted view of the Arian race as superior and all other races as inferior.  The ability for a majority to suppress a minority and to characterize its religion, culture, social supports and to blame a minority for the ills of a nation.

And some animals do not deserve to live.  Stalin and Pavlov added "proof" to that.  It had to do with eugenics and psychiatry, and the economics of war.   All they had to do after that was pick any group they wanted "cleansed".  It started with the institutionalized people, and progressed to other groups.      Look up a book called "The Men Behind Hitler" which tells the history up to that point.     This site has a complete history with videos:  www.cchr.org|`|nxrEuJsRaa	Hitler was a powerful orator and was antisemitic from a young age whilst in Austria. It was his passionate speeches and carefully planned propaganda in a troubled Germany that made the majority(but not all) Germans fall like dominoes into a blind hatred of one race. neighbours and friends could no longer be so,Hitler believed in racial hygiene to protect Aryan blood. With the bully tactics and evil intimidation of the SS its hardly surprising that many Germans who couldn't support the hatred went underground.  As well as Jewish nationals the Nazis are also responsible for the killings of disabled children(unclean blood lines)  non-Jewish Poles (over three million), communists or political opponents, members of resistance groups, homosexuals, Roma, the physically handicapped and mentally retarded, Soviet prisoners of war (possibly as many as three million), Jehovah's Witnesses, Adventists and Neo pagans, trade unionists, and psychiatric patients were killed.     There are many people that just don't accept this happened. We must learn from this part of history to ensure this kind of torture and inhuman treatment of other human beings never happens again|`|IWbFqtQ3aa	Google the word antisemitism.

So, you pick a topic, in this case, transportation in US History and do research. After doing research, you find something that you find interesting and make an argument out of it and back it up with research. Note: You don't have to be right. History isn't about being right because their really is no "right" answer. History is about making an argument and backing it up with evidence, in this case the evidence is research.    So lets say you do research and find naval transportation fascinating. Do some more research and find what aspect of naval travel is so interesting to you. You decide that Ironclad steamships are cool because they, according to your evidence, revolutionized shipbuilding and their uses in war fare. So you write this thesis:     The building and use of the Ironclad warships in the US Civil War marked the end of wooden navel vessels and gave rise to new technologies such as the submarine and long ranged naval artillery.      Now I don't know if any of that is true, I stay away from US history. It's an argument and if backed up with evidence, its a good argument. But notice how I took your broad topic and narrowed it down to a specific type of ship in the Civil War. A good thesis is as narrow as possible, while still being interesting. A good writer and historian could write a 30 page paper about Emperor Augustus' fingers on the Prima Porta statue. He would have to compare it to fingers in other statues of Augustus or other imperial portraits and find regional similarities..etc. My point is, essays can be VERY specific, and often the more specific the better they are.

The early history of the clan is unknown, but Donald Macduffie witnessed a charter at Dingwall in 1463.  The clan was prominent in the history of the Western Highlands, and Macfie of Colonsay was one of the principal chiefs who met Bishop Knox and signed the famous 'statues of Iona' in 1609.  Colonsay passed out of the possession of the clan some years later.  In 1615 Malcolm Macfie of Colonsay joined in the rebellion of Sir James MacDonald, and he was later delivered to the Earl of Argyll by Coll Kitto MacDonald.  In 1623 Coll Kitto was charged with the cruel slaughter of Malcolm and several of his followers.  Colonsay passed to the MacDonalds and then to the MacNeils who brought fame to the island.      When the Macfies were dispossessed, sone of them followed the MacDonalds, and others settled in the Cameron country of Lochaber, and they supported that clan at the Battle of Culloden.  In Galloway the name took the form of Macguffie and Machaffie.    Ewen Macphee who lived in the middle of the 19th century was famous as the last of the Scottish 'outlaws.'  He enlisted in the army, but deserted as a result of a misunderstanding and settled with his family on an island on Loch Quioch.  He recognised no law and no landowner, resided rent free, and defended his home with firearms, his wife being as proficient in their use has her husband.  He held it until in his old age he indulged in sheep sealing for which he was ejected."    You can always print out the family crest (of dubious value) on the following link and enlarge it.

(try to make junk food as unavailable as possible.  make sure there's more fruit and vegetables out instead of something like cookies or candy.  if you pack your lunch, be very aware of what your packing.  if you buy it, then you really need to think about it.  go for the salad bar instead of another cheeseburger)|`|7rQDuCDlaa	I'm 5'7" and 12st7.
