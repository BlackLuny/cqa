3W43J3rWaa	I would say that your engine is already in the ~age~, so the inside leak is caused by the internal cylinder head worn out,  and also turbo charger looks like is worn out too and it cause lubricant - oil go straight into the exhaust. Engine and turbo charger rebuild.|`|NtIOVAxkaa	If you take it to a good mechanic , they will fix it , Unless you need a new engine.|`|8HbqHeMtaa	I'm not 100% if it has one but first check for a pcv valve- a hose exiting the top of the valve cover should be connected to it before it goes back to the air filter housing. If you're leaking compression, that could excess blow back pressure thereby pushing excessive oil up the pcv valve and clog it or possibly the air breathing system itself entirely- (make sure you're air filter is not as black as your oil). I suggest having a mechanic "de-gunking" the engine clean and then letting her run- intermmediantely at high revolutions to see where the leak is coming from exactly. Could be another area.

2c9b8ab90ad26a99183dc95ec8044236aa	When you say the bikes shuts off do you mean just the engine or the electrics too?  If it's just the engine it might just be it's running so poorly that it can't handle the load of the gears turning. OR  When you put the bike in gear are you remembering to put your kick stand up? There is a kill switch on your kick stand that will kill the engine if you put it in gear while the stand is in the down position. Just checking!<br>  You didn't state the mileage on your Suzuki. Your problem with the backfiring could be a couple of things. 1. Your valves might need adjustment. If you let them go too long out of adjustment they cause the engine to backfire to the point that they eventually burn a valve. 2. the electronic ignition has gone bad and needs replaced. The only way I know to check it is to replace it with a known good one. 3.The timing chain has stretched or the timing chain adjuster needs replaced and has caused the engine to jump it's timing. <br>  So start with the simple things first that you can check. Get a Clymer repair manual or a Suzuki Shop manual for your bike and read it and trouble shoot your problem. Check the spark first. If you can check it running that's even better. It should be a fat blue spark. If it's weak or non-existent then you have an ignition problem. If that's good check your valve adjustment and timing. If that's good take out your spark plugs and check the compression. Don't take it to a shop until you have a good idea what's wrong with it. You may be able to fix it yourself. If not at least you'll know what the problem is and can talk the talk at the shop and maybe get a better deal at the repair shop. Good Luck|`|a2bee5a6412ce5355f40132b7d3fb4e9aa	Greetings from the Siaket Riders MC.<br>  1. When you switch into the 1st gear and the bike stops, it's your clutch. Exactly the clutch disks are hanging, the disks are in oil, and after not using it, you've to take them out to clean them with petrol.Back firing could be your valves. You got to adjust them first, after wards the carburetors. But you need to start at a, then b, and C......Check your spark plugs first. You can see the color, and you know much about rich fuel, or no fuel....|`|9234c331d21e206bd81026b563696b09aa	It sounds like your bike has somehow slipped the timing. It has(I think, two timing chains) anyway, your problem is the timing. this requires opening up the engine, so if you don't have some experience and the proper tools this is a shop job.

ooTfG1e9aa	You need to install new gaskets when servicing the manifold and head gaskets. The head gaskets have a compression ring (metal) around each cylinder that is crushed when the head is installed and torqued to specifications, creating the seal on the compression side. They cannot be reinstalled, as the crush has already been made to the comp ring. You will not get them to seal adequately and, voila, blown head gaskets.<br>  <br>  I agree that the valve cover gaskets, if made of rubber, can be reused, if they are still pliable. If they are hardened or dried and cracked, replace them. They are not very expensive.|`|JNTQwvtTaa	You might, but why would you want to? The thing is apart. Take the opportunity to freshen it up as much as you can.|`|vEsSIGfYaa	Reuse of the old gaskets can result in premature failure [compared to new gaskets].<br>  <br>  IF the old gaskets are not damaged then they could be reused, BUT...<br>  <br>  Considering all the labor involved in the project, it is foolish to not use brand new gaskets throughout the engine.|`|crhJLuw5aa	The only gaskets that you MIGHT be able to reuse are the valve cover gaskets, but ONLY if they're made out of rubber and not damaged. Cork gaskets and metal head gaskets are designed to be used ONLY ONCE. When you tighten them down it crushes them and forms them to the contours of the parts being mated. Although you technically COULD reuse them, they would almost certainly leak.

AA12151417	the angle of the pipe/hose that goes to your gas tank is causing the fuel to build up right at the pump which then clicks off to prevent overflow.       try pulling the pump handle out a little bit or not squeezing the lever as far so the gas pumps slower.        also--do you use the same station and pump every time?   sometimes the problem is a faulty pump.  unless you have a very old car it is unlikely in need of fixing, because most cars have a heavy rubber hose with the exception of the older ones that have metal pipes which sometimes rust out.|`|AA10395737	try putting the gas in you car at a slower rate...it doesn't have time to go all the way down and that's why it's spitting back at you.|`|6aab7e8f480422b2be6699cdeb929968aa	the handel clicks when it starts to over flow so u either have something blocking it or su have a full tank|`|9b3d15aebddd9a0d9fc8d38a66c1177caa	try pulling the nozzle out a little big from the tank.

American Airlines has not been involved in any mishaps lately, so I guess the former.  That's academic, because the answer is the same for both.<br>     There have been 2 airline accidents in the US recently that have gotten a lot of press coverage, including one where no one died.  The tens of thousands of flights that occurred without a problem did not generate any coverage. If every fatal automobile accident in the country got this type of coverage you would be terrified to get on the highway. <br>       Here's something to remember: 99.9% of airline flight crew-members (pilots and cabin staff) will retire without seeing anyone suffer as much as a scratch on a flight they are on.  These are people that will be in air for most of their working life, and will end up retiring after as much as 35 years of service.  They fly thousands of flights over decades and few will ever be involved in an accident.  If all of these folks fly for all of those flights for all of those years with out a problem, the chances of any one person on any one flight being in an accident is incredibly small.|`|BeLOqghLaa	Up until a few weeks ago, the United States went 2.5 years without an airline fatality.

The larger engines also tend to be smoother revving. In terms of reliability, I was considering a used A4 myself not too long ago, until the economy hit and I decided to hold onto my money, but in doing my research, I found both models seemed to have similar ratings.

You can't be 100% sure.  I might tend to stay away from a dealer selling cars that have obvious problems. Most dealers would have changed the tires if they caused a problem. I've never looked at a car at a dealer with tires that would need to be replaced right away. That's certainly not normal. Most dealers would have replaced the tires before putting the car up for sale. It might not be wise to buy any car that doesn't test-drive well and try to guess at what the problem might be before you buy. This dealer sounds kind of small-time and suspect.

QFf9phAmaa	yes most bank do so but with heavy discount|`|KcHSMb0Iaa	the bank should finance it, but they will usually only finance slightly lower than the value of the car. so if theyre asking price is higher than the cars value, you probly wont get a loan, but then again if the asking price is higher than the value, you shouldnt be buying it anyway. some banks are different too, if one denys you, just try another.

Make sure you like it first, and are doing the right modifications to it. The civic is not a fast car, it will never be. It is an efficient, safe, and friendly car with a huge community following. <br>  <br>  Most mods will make it look better (or at least different), but very few will make it faster than a minivan.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I own a civic and never regret it.|`|RvWmmjWiaa	Honda civic is a very reliable second hand car.

cAGv5evLaa	The engine would rev as soon as it started.<br>  If it's an older car with a carburettor, if you press the pedal too many times before you start it, it will flood the engine with gas and won't be able to start for a while because it's squiriting gas in there every time you press the pedal.<br>  On a newer car, that's not going to happen because it's got an electronic fuel injector and it doesn't do anything until you turn the key.<br>  <br>  Either way though, it will rev once it starts|`|5xxuKzXPaa	i can not speak for all manufacturers but on most gm vehicles, it will go to a clear flood mode and stop injector activity, until the pedal is released. other manufacturers could have a similar program. on older cars the engine will start and rev real high until you let go or until something lets go in the block.|`|AzeOk29saa	I would be driving, silly.|`|kDxljPUnaa	It depends on the car really. If the throttle is electronically connected to the petal, the car will start normally and them rev to a higher rpm. If the throttle and petal are connected mechanically, the car may not will start normally but when it, or if, it does it will rev to a higher rpm. <br>  <br>  You should not start a car with the petal all the way down. The oil between the moving parts in the engine many not be available in the proper amounts to provide adequate lubrication. Spinning or scalling a bearing on a crankshaft is VERY expensive to repair.|`|vtul2lc1aa	On most fuel injected cars the engine will not start under those conditions. On most carburetted cars the car won't start if it is cold but will if it is already warmed up. The engine under any circumstances will suffer severe damage if started and reved emediately as the oil is not under pressure until the engine has been runing for a few seconds at least.

M1uIZQ2Maa	Impossible to answer without knowing what kind of car your talking about.<br>  <br>  When in doubt, call the dealer for your make of car and they'd be happy to tell you for sure (sometimes it says on the coolant reservoir cap).<br>  <br>  The reason for your light acting the way it does is because when the car is cold the coolant is at it's lowest level. As the engine heats up the coolant expands and some will expand out into the expansion tank (reservoir) where the level sensor is turning off the light. <br>  <br>  As the car cools down again, some coolant is drawn back into the cooling system, lowering the level in the expansion tank, and if it's too low, it will turn in the light again the next time you start the car.<br>  <br>  <br>  To add, if you have a newer GM car it will have Dex-Cool a very poor, orange colored, "long-life" antifreeze installed from the factory. You can top up with Dex-Cool or any newer aluminium compatable coolant. <br>  <br>  I would actaully recommend you have the cooling system completely flushed as that coolant has a problem with causing build-ups in the cooling system, but there's no big rush for it.|`|txoXobsAaa	look in your owners manual and see what kind of coolant your car need. if right now there is orange coolant, DO NOT put the green coolant in.

Maybe Ferdinand Porsche wore one, but if so it has never been mentioned in any of the VW history books that I have read.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry, but if you were referring to Thong which is a hamlet south-east of Gravesend in Kent, England, then you will have to ask some of the older residents (Also don't think many VW;s  were there as that was at the height of the first world war with Germany).

cAGv5evLaa	I agree with Marion - your thermostat is a bi-metal valve that is supposed to open and close with hot and cold temperature (eg - when you're stopped vs when you're going fast on the highway). But it's not electrical or "smart" in any way, so it could get stuck in the open position (WAY better than getting stuck in the closed position). <br>  This would mean water is always flowing through, which could cause that fluctuation. Plus it sounds like you've ruled the other possibilities out.<br>  <br>  ps - NEVER drive with your radiator empty! Even if you're just testing - you could overheat your engine. When you say your needle was pinned on maximum hot, that could have been very harmful to your engine. Even if it still runs, it could have a lot of damage done, especially to the weaker components like rubber seals and thinner metal components inside. In the worst case, it could catch fire or seize and you would lose the car.|`|dNj1RjWHaa	check to make sure your cooling fans are coming on and at the right time (temp wise) if that is good the you have a bad radiator. airflows through when vehicle is moving. as soon as vehicle stops moving airflow stops and engine starts to overheat.|`|5xxuKzXPaa	i think that jack is very close at least. if the car is cool going into a stop light but hot leaving it, that tells me that you do not have a fan pulling cool air through the radiator. i would look at fuses for the cooling system , relays or a possible computer failing to send the signal to the fan (relay) or even the fans them selves can be at fault for this.|`|GJdPuagzaa	Good chance this is a bad thermostat. Instead of opening and closing to let cool water in, it's just stuck and letting only hot water circulate. It's a cheap part and usually cheap to install. However, some shops will say they want to compression test your engine to make sure it's not a leak. <br>  That is not cheap. Look under your car and see if it's leaking. If so sniff the leak. If it smells like coolant, it's a leak. Otherwise, thermostat.

c1a600e6083d6130287db4610398bcd3aa	The 30 pounds is 30 pounds per square inch air pressure.  If your car weighs (for example) 2400 lb, then at that tyre pressure you need 2400/30 = 80 square inches of tyre area pressing on the ground to hold it up.  You have 4 wheels, so per wheel that makes 20 square inches.  So the bottom of the tyre flattens a bit until 20 square inches are flat on the road (that's say 5 in x 4 in).  That's the whole story.  Note if you lose tyre pressure the tyre has to flatten more to generate a higher contact area - typical "flat tyre".|`|TnIsuYqYaa	You put  the air in the tyres on your car,thats how.|`|cAGv5evLaa	The air is inside an enclosed space (tire), so it can't escape. <br>  By inflating the air pressure to 30 pounds Per Square Inch you are basically putting an air cushion underneath the car, because like I said that air can't go anywhere.<br>  <br>  That's about as simple as it gets without going into the physics of why it works like that.|`|uUGB5zyRaa	Its not 30 pounds of air, its 30 Psi, or  30 pounds per square inch.<br>  <br>  Its very difficult to compress that air in a tire, hence the tire keep their shape with a decent ride.
cAGv5evLaa	It's probably a ruined battery. Car batteries are such that if you leave them on a low enough charge (ie - dead) for more than a couple days they will lose their ability to hold a charge - which means that you can jump the car and it will run (the alternator gives power to the car when the engine is running) but you won't be able to start it on its own (the battery is there to give power when the engine is not running - that is its only real job).<br>  Before you replace the battery, try taking off the cables and brushing off any corrosion with a wire brush - if the terminals are corroded then the battery circuit will be open and the electricity won't be able to flow through the wires. <br>  If you've gotten a nwe battery and it still does that, you could have a dead starter - try tightening/adjusting the wires on the starter and hitting the starter with a rubber malet (sometimes after sitting for a while the started could get frozen up and banging on it with a rubber malet will loosen it up - but you would still need to get a new one)<br>  <br>  A quick way to tell if your battery is really dead is to check when you turn the key on - are there any lights that come on inside the car? Can you turn on the radio? If not, or if they're really dim, then the battery is dead.|`|Kbj0Lhxfaa	if the other electronics in the car wont turn on then it's electrical. if they do then it is probably your starter.|`|GWoW1o5oaa	Possibly dirty or loose battery terminals.

a5bc29a0d2c99139f7ecd08c84e5397daa	S'il s'agit des alarmes sonores, celles qui réveillent tout un quartier et n'ont jamais empêché un voleur de démarrer, la réponse est tout de suite "non". C'est du dépassé (sauf si on veut vraiment embêter un voisin...).<br>  <br>  Les antivols actuels (bloquant le démarrage) semblent efficaces mais ont pour inconvénient de déplacer le délit en incitant le voleur à s'en prendre au propriétaire lorsqu'il veut s'en emparer. Passer de l'agression matérielle à l'agression physique, ce n'est pas vraiment un progrès... (à moins de  ne se déplacer qu'avec des gardes du corps. Pas pratique du tout et co?teux !).<br>  <br>  Reste le système de la "puce" noyée quelque part dans la carrosserie qui permet de localiser par satellite un véhicule volé mais il faut compter sur la (plus ou moins) bonne volonté de coopération de la maréchaussée qui n'a évidemment pas que ?a à faire (en plus ce doit être vrai !).<br>  <br>  Le mieux, il me semble, est de "renforcer" l'antivol de série par un antivol mécanique (genre barre de volant ou frein à main/levier de vitesse) afin de ralentir la tache du voleur. Je dis bien ralentir car dans la pratique, rien ne peut empêcher un vol, surtout s'il s'agit d'un modèle de prestige qui sera ensuite écoulé à l'étranger pour le compte d'un "client" qui ne souhaite pas passer par un concessionnaire...<br>  <br>  Sur ce point, on peut choisir comme voiture un modèle "passe partout" peu en vogue. Je ne suis pas s?r qu'un voleur de voiture soit attiré par une Lada des années 80 et même par les premières séries de Skoda post-communistes... Il y a aussi l'alternative consistant à décorer sa voiture de manière très voyante mais après, il faut assumer le regard d'autrui !<br>  <br>  PS - En toute occasion et quelle que soit votre voiture, lorsque c'est possible, laissez-là en stationnement à c?té d'une plus belle et plus luxueuse !

( The plate on your dashboard seen from the driver side front windshield looking in. Or check your registration it is printed there too. <br>  <br>  The websites should be able to tell you if you have anything special. You have a numbers matching car young lady, and it is a collector. If there is something special about it I.E., 1 of 1100 made with your particular rear end, etc. Then it might be worth something north of 10 grand. <br>  <br>  At the very least you would be able to list it there and find buyers fast. Also go to Hemmings.com This is where the car collectors are, you can put it in the magazine relatively cheap.

KPr8MoPqaa	to be honest,I wouldn't change the size of the rim because it effects the performance,handling and stopping of the car!!
Yq2CUhtYaa	I don't care about a 5 star answer, or even the chosen answer.<br>  <br>  The truth is this:<br>  <br>  A performance chip rearranges your fuel map, that's all.<br>  <br>  Sure, you get higher peak numbers.<br>  <br>  At the cost of two things.<br>  <br>  1. Low end power is gone, because to moved it to peak numbers. So your acceleration actually suffers.<br>  <br>  2. It causes the engine to run lean, which ultimately ends up damaging your pistons, piston rings, etc.<br>  <br>  Finally, a governor was designed to limit the TOP SPEED of a vehicle. It does absolutely nothing against acceleration.<br>  <br>  So, unless you somehow manage to get your vehicle up to 150+, it won't matter anyway.<br>  <br>  Not that it matters as your 1997 truck doesn't have a governor in the first place. It has a speed limiter, which is designed to prevent you from damaging the engine.<br>  <br>  Long story short, the engine is tuned for optimal performance and reliability, from the factory.<br>  <br>  You can't improve on it, without taking away something else.<br>  <br>  Want performance? Stop with the 305, and swap a 350 engine in, instead. It'd cost about the same, and you'd get a ton more power out of it, right out the door.<br>  <br>  I've owned two 305 cars, and if you ever want anything more than about 250-300 horsepower, you've got the wrong engine.|`|muPiBQ3Uaa	If any GM dealership tried to alter the programming of any PCM in any GM vehicle to anything other than the original parameters, their franchise would be pulled by GM in a hot minute.<br>  If you want more power, go with something other than the 5.0.|`|bOaqWNxRaa	There are a few things that you can do to slightly improve performance, but these mods won't do a whole lot. But I encourage you. I love Chevy trucks, and I also love 305 engines. Truck engines are stronger than the car engines, anyway. So you already have a leg up.<br>  <br>  Get a K&N air filter. That will cost around $50. Use Bosch platinum spark plugs. Have the plugs properly overgapped for better spark. Use some high quality spark plug wires, like Accel, Taylor brand, or MSD. Use Royal Purple motor oil.<br>  <br>  These mods will cost you around...$200 or so. You will gain around ten extra horsepower.<br>  <br>  Also, have the timing advanced a little bit on the engine. That will increase low end performance. And, it's a freebie!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your Truck!

AA10746201	Trailers sold in that price range often need roof repairs.  Also they are very used, check the wheel bearings and condition of electric brakes (if any). Be sure to bleach the water tan a couple times if you intend to use it for drinking.<br>  <br>  Another good idea is to hook it up to a water supply BEFORE you guy it, this will expose bad pipes or leaks.  <br>  <br>  I also "bug bomb" em when I get it home, never know what crawled in it while it sat.
bf4757f4f354855ce33fb48482a8ccb5aa	A bank won't give you a loan because you haven't proven you can make a payment.   If a bank (a proffessional lender) won't loan, I sure wouldn't.   Furthermore you don't have any money for a down payment.   If you can make the payments, why can't you save some?<br>  <br>  Your real problem is you are trying to finance a depreciating asset.  You will be paying interest forever and that will be made worse with your bad credit and you will have a high rate.<br>  <br>  What you need to do if you can really make payments is put what you would make in payments, say $300 a month in<br>  savings.   In 20 months you would have $6000 which would buy an acceptable truck.   In another 20 months you would have another $6000 plus about $4000-5000 that your truck would be worth.<br>  <br>  In 40 months you could have a $10000+ truck PAID for with only a little sacrifice which is a VERY important to somebody on fixed income.   You don't have the ability to earn more money, you've got to use what you have to the best of your ability to get ahead.  <br>  <br>  Compare that to financing a $12000 truck right now on 60 months.  In 40 months from now you would still owe $5200 on the truck that is only worth $6000-$7000<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Where would you like to see yourself in 40 months?   Driving a $10000 truck that is paid for or driving a truck that is hardly worth more than you owe on it?|`|b584dcb497cbd511fae75a7f6483233daa	I'm sorry I can't help you, but if you own a home the best bet for financing a vehicle is an equity line (second mortgage).

b8cupXj7aa	In a T-tail configuration, the elevator is above most of the effects of downwash from the propeller as well as airflow around the fuselage and/or wings during normal flight conditions. Operation of the elevators in this undisturbed air makes for control movements that are consistent throughout most flight regimes. <br>  <br>  At slow speeds, the elevator on a T-tail aircraft must be moved through a larger number of degrees of travel to raise the nose a given amount as compared to a conventional-tail aircraft. This is because the conventional-tail aircraft has the downwash from the propeller pushing down on the tail to assist in raising the nose. Since controls on aircraft are rigged in such a manner as to require increasing control forces for increased control travel, the forces required to raise the nose of a T-tail aircraft are greater than for a conventional-tail aircraft. Longitudinal stability of a trimmed aircraft is the same for both types of configuration, but the pilot must be aware that at slow speeds during takeoffs and landings or stalls, the control forces will be greater than for similar size airplanes equipped with conventional tails.<br>  <br>  When flying at a very high angle of attack with a low airspeed and an aft CG, the T-tail airplane may be susceptible to a deep stall. In a deep stall, the airflow over the horizontal tail is blanketed by the disturbed airflow from the wings and fuselage. In these circumstances, elevator or stabilator control could be diminished, making it difficult to recover from the stall. It should be noted that an aft CG could be a contributing factor in these incidents since similar recovery problems are also found with conventional-tail aircraft with an aft CG.|`|AA11087517	When an airplane stalls the airflow across the wings becomes turbulent instead of laminar and greatly reduces the lift.  This is not a problem with a conventional tail because the horizontal stabilizer is not in this turbulent airflow.  On a T-tail the turbulent air flows across the horizontal stabilizer, reducing its effectiveness and making it more difficult to get the force needed to lift the tail and lower the nose.|`|WQjNd9sUaa	A deep stall is a dangerous type of stall that affects certain aircraft designs, notably those with a T-tail configuration. In these designs, the turbulent wake of a stalled main wing "blankets" the horizontal stabilizer, rendering the elevators ineffective and preventing the aircraft from recovering from the stall.<br>  <br>  Although effects similar to deep stall had long been known to occur on many aircraft designs, the name first came into widespread use after a deep stall caused the prototype BAC 1-11 to crash, killing its crew. This led to changes to the aircraft, including the installation of a stick shaker in order to clearly warn the pilot of the problem before it occurred. Stick shakers are now a part of all commercial airliners. Nevertheless, the problem continues to haunt new designs; in the 1980s a prototype of the latest model of the Canadair Challenger business jet entered deep stall during testing, killing one of the test pilots who was unable to leave the plane in time. Also, paragliders are sometimes known to enter a deep stall condition.<br>  <br>  Deep stall is possible with some sailplanes, as their most common designs are T-tail configurations.[citation needed] The IS-29 glider is one of the gliders that are vulnerable to deep stalls when the CG and the overall weight are between certain limits.<br>  <br>  In the early 1980s, a Schweizer SGS 1-36 sailplane was modified for NASA's controlled deep-stall flight program.<br>  <br>  A different type of stall affecting the F-16 fighter is also known as a deep stall because of its similar difficulty in recovery, but for a different reason. The aircraft is designed to be inherently unstable, which when kept under control by its "fly-by-wire" system allows for higher maneuverability. However, this design, coupled with the intent of the control computer to keep the fighter level, prevents the aircraft from pitching nose-down in a stall, which would allow the pilot to recover given sufficient altitude. This is known as a deep stall because the elevators are rendered useless by the flight computer even though, unlike a T-tail, air does contact the elevators, and even with the computer disabled it is difficult to recover from (the pilot must "rock" the aircraft with elevator input until it pitches nose-down, which can take several seconds).<br>  <br>  A T-tail is an aircraft tail stabilizer arrangement in which the horizontal surfaces (tailplane and elevators) are mounted to the top of the vertical stabilizer. Traditionally, the horizontal control surfaces are mounted to the fuselage at the base of the vertical stabilizer. The resulting arrangement looks like a T when viewed from the front or back, hence the name.The aircraft will tend to be much more prone to a dangerous deep stall condition, where blanking of the airflow over the tailplane and elevators by a stalled wing can lead to total loss of pitch control. The F-101 Voodoo suffered from this throughout its service life. For similar reasons, T-tailed aircraft can be much more difficult to recover from a fully-developed spin.<br>  <br>  The vertical stabilizer must be made considerably stronger and stiffer to support the forces generated by the tailplane. Unless expensive composite materials are used, this inevitably makes it heavier as well.<br>  <br>  The T-tail configuration can cause several maintenance concerns as well. The control runs to the elevators are more complex and elevator surfaces are much more difficult to casually inspect from the ground.<br>  <br>  Because of concerns about being able to clear the tail, the first high-speed aircraft with a T-tail, the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter, was at first fitted with a downward-firing ejector seat. For later models of this aircraft, capabilities of ejection seats improved, so it was changed to an upward-firing one, to overcome problems in low-altitude escapes.<br>  <br>  Due to a lack of airflow over the elevator from a forward mounted engine (piston or turboprop), low speed control is reduced and low speed operation is more difficult for aircraft not designed for low speed operation.<br>  <br>  A compromise is also possible, with the tailplane mounted part way up the fin rather than right at the top. The Sud Aviation Caravelle is an aircraft with this configuration.

With the volt meter, it should read 0.1-0.3v at each connection. if more its cuz it takes more volts to push through the bad connection. if less then thats better.

Me personally, I would not pay for someone to fix something like my car, knowing that it's still broken or half-way fixed.|`|59DqeB4laa	I agree with the other posters you should contact you insurance company before accepting the car. These days Insurance company's and Body Shops work together to rip people off. If you are getting no help from either side you should contact your DMV in your state and they can help you. Also the ordered the wrong part excuse is just a way of staling the job because its not ready. Another thing you can do is find a Body Shop that does not do direct repair work for insurance company's and have them look at the work that was done after you get your car back. Independent shops that do not do insurance work love to re inspect and can show you all the short cuts the body shop and insurance company took. The next time you need to go to a shop for work  know that you can take your car to any shop you want. Even if the insurance company tells you that you need to go to there preferred shop it is against the law. Not all but a lot of insurance preferred shops are giving the insurance company a better rate so the shop will try to turn the work out as fast as possible using short cuts and bad parts. Also a good thing to do is talk to people in your area and find out what shop has the best reputation. I know people are in a rush to get there car fixed but you should not rush the process. You have just been in an accident but you need to calm down and take your time when selecting a shop to do the repair.  Mike 19 year Heavy Collision Technician

If you are doing it for a different reason, you may need to disconnect the battery, however, this may cause a problem with the radio if there is an anti-theft code for it.|`|XMOwmWM0aa	Most cars if you unplug the computer from the bat for 15-20 min its memory is lost and when u turn the car back on it will re tune and adjust to the vehicles current engine conditions
rZGq4CDxaa	These days you can buy a new car fairly cheaply.  In the past, a new car was a lot more expensive so you would save a great deal by buying second-hand.

Anyway, I work on a lot of cars and in your price range I would recomend a chevy cavalier in the mid 90's range. You arent going to get anything new for what you have to spend. I recomend this vehicle because they are very reliable, get pretty good gas mileage and the engines last a ling time if properly taken care of. One thing to watch out for is buying one with a blown head gasket which these engines are famous for ( a factory defect basically but once fixed its good to go). Look for one with the 2.2L 4 cylinder engine, which is actaullay pretty peepy for the car. I see them where I live `for about 1200-2000 roughly but cash talks, most people will go down on price if you have cash in hand. Hope this helps.|`|AA11324847	It sounds to me like you're buying your first car. To be honest with you, the best thing you can do with 800-1500 is either to put down on a car, or save until you can get a nice one. The least you can expect to pay for a decent car is about 3K. I'm talking from experience and TONS of research, believe me. Save your money.
dXW3xD0gaa	Many LED are light sensitive.  And so many LED / Transistor technology is light sensitive.  You are probably wiring the photo transistor wrong (apply too much voltage).  PN junctions can carry enough current to destroy themselves without in series resistor - so be careful.<br>  <br>  So I don't think you were cheated but you might have destroyed the transistor.

ffafebee609d64b964cc56c2ea1f6194aa	Insurance cost is not high because it's your first time. It's because you're probably young, male, drive lots of miles, have no credit history, and have a high-powered sporty car that is expensive to repair and is often stolen. Insurance companies know from experience that these are the highest risk policy holders, and are charged accordingly. <br>  <br>  As you get older (about 26), settle down and get married, establish a good driving record and credit history, drive sensible cars, your rates will drop.|`|n3aflPmvaa	Getting quotes online is quick and easy and way better than sitting on the phone. when i got my first policy i was just so anxious that I just used whatever my parents had. Getting the cheapest policy is not always the best either. If you shop around and compare quotes, you can save a TON of money.Car insurance is a requirement for driving in the US.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://insurance.deal4-you.com" rel="nofollow">http://insurance.deal4-you.com</a><br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|93bMnmaFaa	Car insurance does NOT have to cost a arm and a leg. The reason why people pay more than they should is that they don't take a few minutes and simply ask more than one insurer about their rates. Getting more than one quote WILL save you money.<br>  <br>  At the very least, if you get two quotes, you can either compare and take the cheaper one, or tell the other to match or beat it. Think about it. Not getting multiple quotes is just a bad move, and you're telling the insurance agents to rip you off. You compare when you go to the store, why not compare when you're spending hundreds, maybe thousands a year on car insurance?<br>  <br>  Another thing: Get ONLINE car insurance quotes. They only take minutes to do, you don't have to talk to anyone online, and you'll get better rates because you're dealing directly with the company, not their insurance agents. You're practically guaranteed to save, because you won't be paying that agent fee.<br>  <br>  You'll find more info on car insurance, and some places to get some pretty good online rates here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.axalda.info/car-insurance.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.axalda.info/car-insurance.htm...</a>

g9GgbKZUaa	well there are 2 possibilities. sounds like the cam timing is off a little. he may have it a tooth off wich will still allow it to run ok but not allow it to run like it should. it also sounds like you may have the plug wires mixed up somewhere. you should never take all the plug wires off at once. the overheating problem is most likely traped air in the cooling system. if i remember corectly that car had a bleeder screw to purge the air out of the cooling system. if the air was not bled out it will cause problems like this to occur.|`|G1XqmETjaa	plug wures or dist cap for the miss but step dad may have the timing chain wrong go have the car checked out.|`|A0pfvlZraa	wires are not proprly connected or you purchase wrong wires|`|YYYQrC28aa	ignition timing and it sounds like it is running advanced i would take it to a shop and have them set it usually unless you have done this kinda work before it is cheaper in the long run to take it to the shop now rather than later.

NRtqNelmaa	If the belt also runs the water pump, yes it will. Depending on the car you may be able to tighten it or not. Most newer cars use an automatic belt tensioner that must be replaced if no longer keeping the belt tight enough. Older cars had slotted brackets and bolts holding the alternator. Loosen the bolts and move the alternator to tighten the belt on these.|`|abc20da7d47100368c747bf2e1c30876aa	If the alternator belt also drives the water pump, it may cause vehicle overheating.  In order to tighten it, there's a bolt on the alternator bracket that must be loosened, the alternator must be slid down the bracket away from the engine and the bolt must be re-tightened.  If in doubt, have the alternator belt done professionally; it'll only cost a few dollars.  You may have to replace the belt entirely, which means only a few dollars more.  If that doesn't solve the overheating problem, have the cooling system checked.|`|0Dkis6ykaa	well no an alternator keeps everything charged but it also keeps other vital parts running, it could its always a possibility|`|6014066a0993c83cc174d6d206dcca2caa	NO IF IT JUST RUNS THE ALTERNATOR IT JUST KEEPS THE BATTERY CHARGED UP|`|8fXX77kraa	probably not, but year/make/model would be beneficial.|`|FTpy9M8raa	it will if it drives the water pump also  as far as tightening it  you need to list the car some you cant because it has an auto tensioner|`|d6fa54e40015d57e79fb582ecd48613eaa	It shouldn't cause your vehicle to overheat. Stranger things have happend though. To tighten it? Your Alternator should have two blots mounting it to a bracket. One will be slotted so you can move it back and forth. Loosen both of them. The use a long screw driver or something to pry against the alternator to tighten the belt. While holding pressure on it, tighten the non-slotted bolt first. then tighten the slotted one. Once you start it, you'll see it's pretty simple. If you have a "Serpintine" belt.... There will be a pulley by itself that applies pressure to the belt to keep it tight. It's called an idler. Those are spring loaded . And if it's too loose, the belt has stretched and needs to be replaced. Just take it off and put the new one on. There will be a diagram of how it routes through the different pullys near your radiator cover. You can handle it, don't worry. Have fun!

LbOe7omiaa	Así es como dice i-J0SE tuviste un error de dedo, el motor es 2.3litros, este motor es muy popular para modificar y hay muy buen surtido de partes, no te recomiendo que le modifiques el tiempo, ya que en el modelo 74 esto lo hacía automáticamente, ahora, lo que puedes hacer es conseguir el kit Turbo del Mustang '83, '84, el cual te brindará muy decentes 130 hp con una aceleración incluso mejor que la de un V8 302 140hp de esas épocas. Ahora que si lo quieres llevar a un nivel extremo, fabricantes como Cosworth ofrecen alteraciones que los hacen llegar hasta 250 hp!!! nada mas que ahí si sera mucho mas caro.<br>  <br>  Suerte!|`|950033929f6c3f4712d32b18be06c3f5aa	Cambialo por un Chevrolet Camaro!!!!!|`|wiFZW3XNaa	Seguro?

rvjkREgxaa	The worst thing that could've possibly happened is that you overheated your rear brakes, which would mean that you'd need to have your rear brakes serviced, and your brake drums remachined.  But if you notice no unusual sounds or vibration while braking, and no unusually long stopping distances, then your brakes are okay.<br>  <br>  However, there's another thing to check: if the emergency brake seems "easy" to apply (up to the full limit of travel for your brake lever), then you should have a mechanic readjust the emergency brake cable.|`|A0pfvlZraa	get new brakes......if you had a 2 year warranty you might heve a month left....have then check,,,good luck be safe.....ed|`|d721a0a7c3aab6382c7b8b60122b1763aa	I'm not sure about "how bad it is"  but I just wanted to let you know that your not the only one that has done this!!

I'm not real familiar with 87 toyotas but back then most cars had rear drum brakes and the brake shoes were also the e-brake system. if this is the case then worst case scenario is that you would need new rear brake shoes and resurface the rear drums. but you might not need to. drive for awhile WITHOUT the e-brake on(sorry couldn't resist that) and apply the brakes normally. if it warped the rear brakes then you will notice a pronounced shaking in the brake pedal and it will almost feel like its in the seat of the car. if not then you're okay

NRtqNelmaa	Replacing the ignition switch is fairly simple, but you need to check that the actuator rod has not come out of yours. It is located on top of the steering column under the dash. The steering column may need to be unbolted and lowered to get to it. That's where the repair gets complicated because there are several things that need to be disconnected first. I suggest you purchase a service manual for your car that explains how to replace the switch.|`|VUdVuwEpaa	does the ignition key have little black chip on it ,if so that is your problem.....so do u have headlights,and when u turn  the key ,u have nothing ,but do u have guage lights.......it is your chip
