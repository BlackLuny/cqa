aiM6pd8eaa	Ancient societies differ greatly. Athens, for example, was the first democracy and all of its male citizens were politically equal. Sparta, Athens' chief rival, only 100 miles away, built a society where all citizens were raised to be soldiers and the greater population were foreign slaves ("helots".)    As ancient societies progressed, more and more specialized labor was required, so a "slave" may have been a teacher, or a craftsman.|`|AA10912968	I would say that they were pretty much treated like slaves.

Lo que si te puedo decir y casi nadie discute, es el aspecto politico de la obra. Realmente, hay un problema politico dentro de la obra, desde la primera oracion de que hay algo podrido en el estado de Dinamarca. Ese algo podrido es la realeza. Por eso es que TODOS deben morir, solo hay una persona que no est da?ada por la corrupcin, Fortinbras, que est en las afueras. El problema politico es la sucesion de un buen candidato para que el estado de Dinamarca regrese a su forma ideal y sin corrupcin.    Despues te puedes meter tambien en los aspectos psicologicos del personaje, su existencialismo, sus dudas, el tomar accion sobre lo que sucede etc, pero en mi opinion es una obra politica mas que otra cosa, y una critica al poder corrupto de la epoca.|`|EW3tQOAzaa	La mayor obra psicolgica que se haya escrito en lengua ingles.

Hamlet no es una obra fcil, tiene vericuetos psicolgicos que hoy da se mantienen, que son un verdadero misterio para el alma humana. La avaricia, la ambicin desmedida, la familia, la solidaridad, la justicia y la injusticia, los amores malogrados por un fin, por un fin justo, pero injusto a la vez.

333f99a7d47ffacf6ba5a798e336dd76aa	El movimiento Dada surgi a la vez en Suiza y Estados Unidos en 1916. Desde Zurich se expandi hacia Alemania y hacia Francia. En Pars es ya el movimiento de moda en 1923. El movimiento Dada tiene la particularidad de no ser un movimiento de rebelda contra otra escuela anterior, sino que se funda en un cuestionamiento de todo el marco conceptual del arte y de la literatura de antes de la Primera Guerra.   El grupo de Zurich     Suiza, a partir del estallido de la guerra en 1914, se convierte en un centro de refugiados pacifistas de toda Europa. All se encontraron todos los disidentes de otras escuelas previas, tales como el expresionismo alemn, el futurismo italiano o el cubismo francs. En 1916, en Zurich, un grupo de artistas instalaron en una cervecera un peque?o cabaret, al que bautizaron como "Cabaret Voltaire". All se reunieron el filsofo Hugo Ball, el poeta Tristan Tzara, el pintor marcel Janco, ambos refugiados rumanos, y el pintor alsaciano Jeans (Hans) Arp. A partir de ese encuentro comenzaron una serie de actividades en el cabaret as como editaron la revista que llevara el nombre de "Dada"     Tristan Tzara pronto se convirti en el promotor y principal exponente del movimiento Dada. Entre l y Hugo Ball dieron sustancia a la teora dadasta.      El origen del trmino Dada es confuso y controvertido. De acuerdo con la versin de Tzara y Ball, la palabra surge de la casualidad: abriendo las pginas de un diccionario con la ayuda de un cuchillo, el primer trmino se?alado fue ese: dada. De acuerdo con otras versiones, fueron los camareros del Caf Terrasse, lugar donde se solan encontrar estos artistas centroeuropeos, quienes identificaron primeramente al grupo como dada: para esos camareros, las lenguas habladas por aquellos emigrados eran incomprensibles, salvo la slaba "da-da" ("s, s", en ruso y otras lenguas)     En pocos meses los espectculos del caf Voltaire fueron famosos en la ciudad Suiza. El espectculo dadasta haba nacido, cargado de provocacin, tendencia agresiva, propuestas ilgicas y absurdas.     En 1917 Francis Picabia, un pintor francs, refugiado tambin en Suiza entra en contacto con Tzara. Ambos darn sentido al Manifiesto Dada de 1918, posiblemente el documento ms importante del movimiento dadasta de Zurich. Tras el fin de la guerra, el dadaismo cautiva a los artistas vanguardistas de Pars, producindose un resurgimiento del mismo. El Zurich dada, con la dispora de sus refugiados, se haba acabado.     El grupo de Nueva York     Tambin la declaracin de guerra llev a la ciudad americana a grupos de artistas refugiados. Entre ellos hay que destacar a Duchamp y Picabia. All se integraron con las corrientes vanguardistas que desde comienzos del siglo se estaban gestando en Harlem, Greenwich Village y Chinatown. Aunque Nueva York no era Zurich, ni exista ese clima de refugiados polticos de la ciudad suiza, el espritu iconoclasta, recalcitrante y nihilista fue idntico. En marzo de 1915 nace la revista "291", nombre tomado del nmero de la casa ocupada por una galera de arte en la Quinta Avenida. Duchamp, Picabia, Jean Crotti, como europeos refugiados, junto con los americanos Man Ray, Morton Schamberg y otros dan vida al dada neoyorquino.     El grupo de Berlin     Tras la guerra, Alemania entra en una crtica situacin. Tras la revolucin bolchevique, el partido Espartaquista alemn -la izquierda socialista- ensaya tambin la revolucin en Alemania. En toda esa agitacin social un grupo de artistas van a incorporarse a las tesis izquierdistas: ser el Movimiento dadaista.     Procedente del grupo de Zurich, Richard Huelsenbeck, trae a Berlin el espritu dadaista, pero mucho ms radical contra las anteriores escuelas vanguardistas (futurismo, cubismo). Junto con el poeta Raoul Hausman promueve declaraciones y manifiestos a partir del "Dada Club". Junto a los anteriores destacarn el pintor Georg Grosz, agudo crtico del militarismo y del capitalismo alemn de aquellos a?os, y los hermanos Herfelde, uno famoso  divulgador de la tcnica artstica del fotomontaje, otro indispensable editor de las obras dadaistas de aquellos a?os.     El movimiento dada berlins pasar a la historia por la incorporacin de las nuevas tcnicas artsticas de difusin de ideas entre las masas, principalmente el fotomontaje. La constitucin de la Repblica de Weimar en 1919 marca el fin de los proyectos polticos dadaistas y la resituacin de este grupo en los marcos artsticos.    Dadasmo definicin : Movimiento de rebelin  que entre  1915 y 1922   se  manifiesta  como un revulsivo frente a la demencia general de la humanidad  enfrascada  en la Primera Guerra Mundial. Dada significa caballito de juguete. Estos pintores reclaman  la intuicin  irracional y la libertad creativa del artista. El arte se confunde con la vida y la vida se ha de  convertir  en constante  manifestacin artstica. Las caractersticas comunes de estos pintores viene a ser la rebelda, su capacidad de negacin y la irracionalidad. Son  inconformistas y subversivos. El ms destacados de estos pintores es  Marcel  Duchamp.         --------------------------------------...    Dadasmo descripcin: Movimiento artstico fundado en Zurich en 1915. Violentamente opuesto a la tradicin, al arte y a la sociedad establecida. Pretenda escandalizar a la opinin pblica acentuando lo absurdo. Dad: Movimiento artstico y literario iniciado en 1916 en Zurich, Pars y Nueva York. Se propona combatir, desde posturas intuitivas e irracionales, el arte y la cultura de la sociedad que haba hecho posible la Guerra Mundial. Tras haber subrayado con un anticonformismo que rozaba el escndalo su voluntad de someter a crtica toda clase de arte, el movimiento agot su impulso original|`|a6ffea25c0aa401a19f230798b7a8fdaaa	Bueno, obviamente el neo-dada, pero por ejemplo el living theater tambien tiene algo dadaista, el performance, la poesia visual tiene algo tambien. Hay grupos teatrales como la fura dels baus que tienen elementos dadaistas bastante claros aunque no lleguen a ese nivel.|`|61pp10vuaa	Dad o Dadasmo, movimiento que abarca todos los gneros artsticos y es la expresin de una protesta nihilista contra la totalidad de los aspectos de la cultura occidental, en especial contra el militarismo existente durante la I Guerra Mundial e inmediatamente despus. Se dice que el trmino dada (palabra francesa que significa caballito de juguete) fue elegido por el editor, ensayista y poeta rumano Tristan Tzara, al abrir al azar un diccionario en una de las reuniones que el grupo celebraba en el cabaret Voltaire de Zurich. El movimiento Dad fue fundado en 1916 por Tzara, el escritor alemn Hugo Ball, el artista alsaciano Jean Arp y otros intelectuales que vivan en Zurich (Suiza), al mismo tiempo que se produca en Nueva York una revolucin contra el arte convencional liderada por Man Ray, Marcel Duchamp y Francis Picabia. En Pars inspirara ms tarde el surrealismo. Tras la I Guerra Mundial el movimiento se extendi hacia Alemania y muchos de los integrantes del grupo de Zurich se unieron a los dadastas franceses de Pars. En 1922 el grupo de Pars se desintegr.  Con el fin de expresar el rechazo de todos los valores sociales y estticos del momento, y todo tipo de codificacin, los dadastas recurran con frecuencia a la utilizacin de mtodos artsticos y literarios deliberadamente incomprensibles, que se apoyaban en lo absurdo e irracional. Sus representaciones teatrales y sus manifiestos buscaban impactar o dejar perplejo al pblico con el objetivo de que ste reconsiderara los valores estticos establecidos. Para ello utilizaban nuevos materiales, como los de desecho encontrados en la calle, y nuevos mtodos, como la inclusin del azar para determinar los elementos de las obras. El pintor y escritor alemn Kurt Schwitters destac por sus collages realizados con papel usado y otros materiales similares. El artista francs Marcel Duchamp expuso como obras de arte productos comerciales corrientes un secador de botellas y un urinario a los que denomin ready-mades. Aunque los dadastas utilizaron tcnicas revolucionarias, sus ideas contra las normas se basaban en una profunda creencia, derivada de la tradicin romntica, en la bondad intrnseca de la humanidad cuando no ha sido corrompida por la sociedad.  Como movimiento, el Dad decay en la dcada de 1920 y algunos de sus miembros se convirtieron en figuras destacadas de otros movimientos artsticos modernos, especialmente del surrealismo. A mitad de la dcada de 1950 volvi a surgir en Nueva York cierto inters por el Dad entre los compositores, escritores y artistas, que produjeron obras de caractersticas similares.

However,  if you are talking about the mythical "Jesus survived the Crucifixion" story, then you would look to France for your answer.     Just as the Romans claimed descent from the Roman Gods (i.e. Julius Caesar from Venus), some of the early Frankish kings claimed to be of the lineage of Jesus. Charles Martel and his descendants were supposedly of this line. The claim was also made about other European kings in the early dark ages. Of course, since this ran counter to church doctrine,and because different dynasties would rise to rule, most families eventually dropped such claims.      So, IF such a line existed, and IF such claims were true, then Jesus' descendants would be European. However, if you believe all of that, then you'd have to consider the idea that Jesus travelled to India during the years not talked about in the Bible, and that there is a chance he went back there, making his descendants East Indian. Since there is no evidence, you can claim what you will. It's pretty hard to disprove a negative.

I tell all my students to go to a reputable guitar store, ( like the Guitar Center or Sam Ash ) and pick out their own guitar. All guitars have a little different sound and action and it's up to the individual to decide which one is right for him/her. People who know nothing about guitars don't realize that if you have ten guitars (all the same brand ) that they'll all have a little different sound and action, action is how high the strings come up from the fret board, some are too high and hard to play, others are too low and make buzzing sounds.  Why not surprise him with a gift certificate to the Guitar Center or Sam Ash and let him pick out his own guitar !

DzPH3QRQaa	Aww :(  But she or he is in Heaven now :)  She'll/He'll be looking down at you forever, and will always love you, no matter what you did to him/her! Because you are his Mommy :) And he/she loves you :)    One of my friends had one of those, and she regrets it BIG time as well! >_    My biggest mistake just HAS to be...  Telling one of my friends a rumor which I thought was true, because one of my OTHER friends told me that rumor.  And that other friend is the one who got the abortion.    I fancied this guy and ....here I go -.-    It all started on msn.  She (Who I will call, L), told me that she and the guy had a talk to each other in school (they are in the same Year), and that the guy asked her out, when he already has a girlfriend.  And she told me that he said, 'Don't worry, she won't find out :)'  And then said that they had a drink at a party together, and got really drunk and then woke up the next day to find that they were in the same bed.   And I felt really gullible at that time.  I actually BELIEVED it :(  So I told my one of my friends, and she thought I was lying, about the guy cheating on her real girlfriend.  I said no (...that was then >_  And somehow, which I dunno how, I think the guy overheard me and her talking, and then they did mean things to me.    Like, him walking with a bunch of his friends and his girlfriend, and one of his friends shouts out to me (in school) '(So and so) IS HERE!!!! xD COME OVER HERE! YOU FANNCCYYY HIMMM!!! xD'  And another time, when I was walking in a rush because I was late for my school taxi >_  -.-    Now I don't like him anymore :)  And now I don't even know if I should tell him or not, about who REALLY made that up in the first place, about him cheating on his gf.  But my 'friend' doesn't want me to tell anyone that she made it up in the first place.  I really don't know what to do anymore -.-  So right now, I just have this, 'rumor truth' hanging over me.  Whenever I see the guy, I feel like I want to tell him that it wasn't ME who made it up in the first place, and tell him it was the other girl.  But I don't want to break friends with the other girl >_  She's pregnant now, again.  So I don't know if I should tell or not, because it might make things more complicated for her >_    (sigh) -.-    Anyway, that's mine :)|`|2c9b34490ff8be3058347037e35f5bbeaa	I believe that people don't make mistakes. They may regret what they do, but people have to judge their actions based on the time they were made, not after months or years of additional knowledge and information.

Learning from and experiencing those mistakes have made me who I am today.    I have thought in the past (as many people have) what if I could do it all over again or if I could travel back and change something?    The thing is, if it wasn't for some mistakes, we might not have experienced something or decided to do something that resulted in something that is now a part of your life.    This could include children, jobs, home etc...    In short, the old philosophy of "When one door closes, another one opens", while at one point if someone says that to you, you would feel like punching them! In retrospect, no term is often truer.

I never have had an abortion, but i have went through a miscarriage, and that devastated me.  I understand how the loss feels, and if you need anything, feel free to talk.    Anyhow, on the mistake part of the question, everyone makes mistakes, whether or not they like to admit it.  but you need to let the past go, otherwise it will control your future.  Yes, it's true that you'll never see that child again, but you have opportunities to bring more life into this world in the future. if you're not ready for children, then be safe with sex.  the time will come, and everything happens for a reason.  If you weren't prepared to be a mother, then i think you made the best decision for you and that child.  I'd rather put them in a better place then bring them into a hell like this if i couldn't support them.      i wish you the best :)|`|iaZxC6lHaa	I've made many mistakes in my life but I can't say that I regret a single one. I wouldn't go back to change anything because I learned from each one of them. That's why my philosophy is that whatever doesn't kill me it makes me stronger. With each mistake with define it, learn from it and move on. It's the only thing we can do because there is no going back.     With that thought I would like to offer to say this to you, learn to forgive yourself and then you will be able to move pass this guilt free, learn to not make the same mistake again by protecting yourself (safe sex) or abstinence, learn to love yourself before attempting to love others.|`|8dhe15MUaa	for me not learning when i was at school over 30 year ago|`|xkV2rZuEaa	EASY, JUST GET IM-PREGNANTED AGAIN...

Le terme de menchevik vient du russe , menchinstvo qui signifie ? minorit ?. Ils s'opposent aux Bolcheviks ( ; de bolchinstvo, ? majorit ?). Le terme de ? minorit ? provient du rsultat d'un vote effectu au congrs au sujet de questions d'organisation et de stratgie, bien que le parti bolchevik f?t rest en minorit politique jusqu' la Rvolution d'Octobre.  Selon leur vision, il s'agit d'abord d'arriver  la dmocratie avec l'aide de la bourgeoisie, puis d'accder au socialisme au fur et  mesure (par le biais de luttes sociales ou de fonds mutualistes par exemple).

ddfccc9ff13a03a9c74364c90d3cf7b8aa	Easy answer:  Before the industrial revolution most people farmed their own land for food and traded with their neighbors or sold their crops, but after the industrial revolution most people went to factories or plants to work.  Boys and girls grew up right alongside their parents and learned most things from them, but once we became industrialized they went to school and (maybe) learned from their parents once they got home from work or finished household chores.  We used to travel by train or horse-drawn buggy, and as such we didn't travel far in most cases.  In our post-industrial society we travel mostly by car or plane and travel thousands of miles just to take a vacation for a week.

Also, as his own producer and stage manager, he designed special costumes for his actors; pioneered in the use of masks; enlarged the stage; and was the first dramatist to have any sort of setting for his plays. Altogether, it is probable that few men in the entire history of the theater, have had such far reaching effect on their chosen profession as him.|`|AA10154508	Aeschylus gave form and function to Greek drama by incorporating plot into the dramatic action.

Son intrt majeur est de prsenter un versant de cette pratique qui demeure encore aujourdhui malheureusement mal connu, voire mconnu, celui de sa mise au service du politique et de la propagande. Prpare par Olga Sviblova, directrice de la Maison de la Photographie  Moscou, cette exposition,  la scnographie sobre et efficace, regroupe quelques 150 photomontages raliss par une dizaine d'artistes tels que Alexandre Rodchenko, El Lissitski, Gustave Klucis, Elena Semenova, Serguei Senkine, Vavara Stepanova, Solomon Telingater, Piotr Galadejv ou encore Alexandre Jitomirski. Les oeuvres prsentes proviennent des collections de plusieurs institutions culturelles moscovites, comme la Maison de la Photographie, le Muse d'Etat V. Mayakowski, et le Muse National du Cinma. On trouve aussi de nombreuses images appartenant  des collections prives, ainsi qu la Galerie Alex Lachmann  Cologne.    Si ces photomontages sont pour la plupart des oeuvres "phares" dj bien connues de tous, la majorit dentres-elles sont pour la premire fois exposes en France. L'exposition traite une large priode, courant de la Rvolution d'Octobre 1917  la mort de Staline en 1953. Les premires salles sont consacres au tout dbut du XXe sicle,  un moment o Lnine, dans ses premiers dcrets, dclare la photographie comme moyen de propagande suprme dans un pays o plus de 70% de la population est illettre. Les pionniers du photomontage sappuient alors sur les innovations esthtiques des avant-gardes europennes, et ?leur appel  la destruction des anciennes valeurs et  la reconstruction dun nouveau monde savre pour un bref instant  lunisson des slogans rvolutionnaires bolcheviques?. On remarquera tout particulirement cette tendance dans les nombreuses illustrations de Rodchenko pour les pomes de Vladimir Mayakowski, et son clbre "Pro Eto" (1923), ainsi que son recueil "La Syphilis". On regrette - essentiellement pour la priode pr-stalinienne - la faiblesse de textes explicatifs qui seraient venus expliciter dune manire plus approfondie ce que lexposition parvient tout de mme  dmontrer grace  sa slection riche et intelligente. En effet, le potentiel du photomontage comme ? arme visuelle ? est employ de manires extrmement diverses par des artistes tels que Rodchenko ou Klucis par exemple. Ce dernier sassocie trs rapidement avec les membres radicaux sovitiques, mettant, ds la fin des annes 1910 son art au service de la machine idologique. Dans ses illustrations pour la revue La Jeune Garde, on remarque une structure visuelle simplifie au maximum, permettant de rpondre  un besoin de clart et dimmdiatet de communication. Klucis se fera lavocat dune image non abstraite, ncessaire selon lui  la production dun message simple et direct. Il dfend une position extrmement critique face aux innovations formelles de Rodchenko ou encore  lallemand J. Heartfield dont il dnonce lesprit anarchiste.    image La mise en lumire des relations entre esthtique du photomontage et cinma exprimental est une des russites notables de cette exposition. On retrouve des illustrations de Rodchenko (1922) pour la revue Kinofot dirige par le ralisateur D. Vertov, des maquettes daffiches de P. Galadjev ralises pour La Mre de Poudovkine (1926), ainsi que quelques unes de ses couvertures pour la revue de cinma Lcran sovitique. On apprciera tout particulirement dans la dernire salle la projection continue de nombreux extraits de films raliss pendant la priode, qui viennent achever dillustrer ces rapports troits existants alors entre le monde du cinma exprimental et les praticiens du photomontage. Lavnement de Staline  la fin des annes 1920 entra?ne une transformation capitale de lutilisation et de la diffusion du photomontage. Ce langage photographique participe alors pleinement  la mise en place de liconographie mythique de la nouvelle re politique. Klucis en est un des plus importants collaborateurs. Lesthtique quil dfendait dj depuis 1917 simpose dsormais  tous. Les photomontages de V. Stepanova pour lalbum 5  4 (1933) en incarnent la dmonstration parfaite: simplification et organisation visuelle, rduction des couleurs au noir, rouge et gamme de gris, vues densemble, reprsentation du peuple en "masse", surplombe par la figure monumentale de Staline. Cette composition simpose partout, on la retrouvera ici notamment chez B. Klintch ("Le 1er mai  Moscou", 1936, voir ci-dessus)) et chez Rodchenko ("LArme Rouge", 1938). La dernire partie de lexposition est consacre  des ?uvres ralises pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, comme celles publies dans des revues illustres telles que SSSR na stro?ke ("LURSS en chantier"). Lutilisation ultime du photomontage comme ?arme visuelle?, comme vritable torture psychologique, est magnifiquement exemplifie chez lartiste Jitomirski, dont les tracts sont jets par milliers aux troupes allemandes. Le dbut de la campagne anti-cosmopolite  la fin des annes 1949 entra?ne la perte du droit de photographier  de nombreux artistes et annonce lradication progressive de lesthtique constructiviste.

ea07b8749535dc9ec98ed8407558778aaa	Le premier pharaon nubien attest se nomme Kachta, frre d'un autre nomm Alara, qui rgna vers 780 av.J.C. Il s'agit, dans l'histoire gyptienne, de la XXV dynastie, dominant la Nubie, la Haute Egypte (Thbes et Karnak), et contre laquelle le souverain de Sa?s (Basse-Egypte), Tefnakht, combattit en vain et fut vaincu par Piankhy vers 736 av.J.C. Le centre politique de cette dynastie se trouvant trs au sud,  Napata, comme l'attestent les ruines et inscriptions du Gebel Barkal, l'Egypte du nord, ou Basse-Egypte, chappa plus ou moins  leur contr?le, jusqu' ce que les Assyriens envahissent le pays et chassent ces Nubiens vers le sud. Le dernier pharaon noir attest est Tantamanni, sous le rgne duquel Karnak fut pill et incendi par les Assyriens, qui s'arrtrent  Assouan, le laissant rgner sur le sud jusqu'en 656 av.J.C. Ensuite, les annales de l'Egypte, aprs le dpart des Assyriens, considrent les pharaons du Nord, ceux de Sa?s, comme les rois de toute l'Egypte, et leur dynastie est la XXVI, dite "Sa?te" (702-525 av.J.C).     Il n'est pas 'tabli' que les anciens Egyptiens taient noirs: les tudes faites sur les momies royales et civiles montrent tout le contraire. Le tmoignage des arts est sujet  caution: ainsi, dans les sanctuaires "noirs" soudanais, du Gebel Barkal, Napata, Mro et d'ailleurs, les artistes noirs, influencs par les modles gyptiens, reprsentent leurs rois vainqueurs avec une peau brune mais assez claire, et les ennemis vaincus avec la peau ... noire! Le ralisme n'tait pas  l'ordre du jour.

En fait, via le bronzage, elle protge l'ARN des cellules de la peau des rayons ultraviolets (surtout UVB) du soleil. Lors d'une exposition prolonge au soleil, on bronze car le corps fabrique plus de mlanine, on est donc mieux protg contre les UV, Elle est prsente en quantit proportionnelle  la complexion. Ainsi une personne  la peau noire en a fabriqu beaucoup plus qu'une personne  la peau blanche. en fait c'est une adaptation gntique au climat, qui est devenue hrditaire par mutation, d'ailleurs, les africains qui ont toujours vcu dans nos climats sont en gnral plus clairs, et peut-tre deviendraient -ils blancs aprs plusieurs gnrations, et vice-versa, des blancs vivants de plusieurs gnrations en afrique pourraient foncer et devenir noirs|`|QTLDSy3Laa	Je crois que c'est parcque nos ailleux sont rests plus longtemps au four...

Sans abolir la ncessit du dsir, elle le rend compatible avec le souci de conserver la qualit de la relation avec lautre, ce qui est aussi vertu. Lhomme modr est celui qui apprend  tre prudent, en restant quanime devant toutes choses. Cest cette galit qui assure la paix de lame devant le cours des choses, si bien que le contentement nest plus le rsultat dune ascse du dsir. Il est sur le chemin de la ralisation du dsir, mais dun dsir qui a t duqu par le sens exact de lacceptation de la ralit. Le contentement vrai prcde le dsir. Le sage sait dsirer, mais conna?t la patience du temps, il sait quil peut ne pas tre affect par le vent de la fortune. Il sait dsirer, tout en prenant les choses telles quelles sont. Nous n'avons pas de prise sur le fruit de l'action, mais seulement sur l'action elle-mme.

" Pour ce qui est des dsirs vains, il faut les fuir comme la peste et sen dbarrasser. Ils nous entra?nent dans des poursuites imaginaires, ils engendrent des souffrances sans nombre. Il faudra refouler ce genre de dsirs. Pour ce qui est des dsirs naturels, quoique non ncessaires, nous devons trouver le sens du juste quilibre entre lexercice strict du dsir et son excs. La sexualit, le fait dcouter de la musique, de se donner aux charmes de la peinture etc. tout cela nest pas vital. Il suffit donc dans ce domaine dviter tout dommage corporel, tout en conservant lutilit du dsir. Pour ce qui est des dsirs naturels et ncessaires, il faudra chercher  voir comment les satisfaire au mieux. On veillera surtout  supprimer toute douleur. Sagissant des besoins, cela ne devrait pas tre difficile, puisque ces dsirs sont limits par les exigences de la nature. Ils sont faciles  satisfaire.

JRDXrAibaa	beh in primo luogo nonostante l'iconografia classica, gli imperatori difficilmente parlavano alla folla (come ad esempio faceva  Mussolini dal balcone di piazza venezia), non ne aveva bisogno...  se l'imperatore parlava lo faceva all'interno delle sedi legislative o consultive (senato, parlamento, consiglio) interloquendo con persone qualificate.  Il popolo sottostava alle sue decisioni e pertanto non aveva bisogno di essere convinto con le parole.  come giustamente  stato detto, se l'imperatore aveva bisogno di comunicare loro qualcosa lo faceva tramite affissione, pubblicazione o a mezzo di messi e portavoce, d'altra parte l'organizzazione per caste permetteva la diffusione del messaggio fino ai ceti pi bassi.  al contrario era la folla che parlava all'imperatore al trionfo, esaltando il suo rientro in patria con urla e grida di gioia...|`|fGpXJEmJaa	raramente l'imperatore faceva un discorso in prima persona davanti al popolo ( lo faceva + spesso il dictator). di solito erano i banditori che giravano le piazze e il foro, o passavano volantini soprattutto negli anfiteatri e nei teatri , oppure veniva perfino scritto sui muri degli edifici, una specie di pubblicit. ce ne sono molti di questi esempi a pompei.|`|0ad3a366087503437b7d34f25e153935aa	e una domanda che a volte facio a me stesso perche quando vedi i film dell'epoca romana o greca non so come l'ultimo della fila reusciva a sentire, puoi vederlo anche nell ultimo film di Mel Gibson piu antico ancora APOCALYPTO nel che puoi vedere del alto della piramide come lo stregone de la tribu parla alla folla gi e tutti aparentemente sentono,questo sono effetti cinematografici penso nella realta magari la voce andava del uno al altro cosi tutti se ne acorgevanno de la voce dell imperatore|`|fea83588ffb4b98171d0f148954836fdaa	cittadini popolo di roma..esisteva il senato e le famiglie che contavano erano al senato il resto erano degli straccioni che non avevano nessun diritto gli bastava mangiare e basta.. comunque nelle piazze dei delegati parlavano al popolo che faceva cosi da passaparola ...|`|777ac571fb0b8c7bdad8a7de6397fe2faa	urlavano|`|UqF0tMIiaa	si faceva una specie di passaparola|`|486d2c71427eea2bd7c61fa646a6218eaa	Hai ragioni i primi a sfruttare la radio sono stati i dittatori mussolini e hitler.

Guarda il teatro greco e romano: le forme  di quei luoghi sono tuttora un esempio di efficenza acustica, In alcuni teatri romani (mi sembra Ercolano)  sono state trovate anfore poste sotto il coro che amplificavano la voce degli attori.  Gli attori stessi recitavano con maschere  dalle  bocche molto allargate per funzionare da megafoni   Anche gli oratori disponevano nelle piazze e nelle basiliche di posizioni sopraelevate poste in  particolari posizioni  Che permetevano l'amplificazione della voce  Nelle chiese cristiane che riprendono la forma della basilica  il coro viene posto nell'abside  e questo   permette di focalizzare la voce lungo la navata.

Come noi anche loro scrivevano sui muri dei veri e propri manifesti elettorali...  da Staccioli, Elezioni a Roma:  La propaganda elettorale a Roma tramite le scritte sui muri:  Col tempo, alla propaganda fatta in proprio dai candidati, cominci ad affiancarsi, fino poi a sostituirla, quella condotta per loro conto dai rispettivi sostenitori, da soli o riuniti in gruppi di pressione e in ?comitati elettorali?. Di pari passo, alla propaganda orale sand sempre pi accompagnando quella scritta, con limpiego di ?manifesti? o ?annunci? (programmata) dipinti sui muri. Cerano per tale incombenza i ?professionisti del pennello? (scriptores) che in tempi ?normali? provvedevano allesecuzione di avvisi dogni genere (da quelli per gli spettacoli a quelli per le vendite o le locazioni di immobili) e nel periodo della campagna elettorale e fino al giorno delle votazioni concentravano la loro attivit al servizio dei candidati o dei loro comitati di sostegno. Molti lavoravano da soli, altri coadiuvati da piccole squadre delle quali potevano far parte un imbianchino (o dealbator) , che stendeva il velo di calce sulla parete prescelta, un ?portascala? (scalanus), che portava e poi reggeva la scala sulla quale lo scriptor saliva per eseguire ?manifesto? fuori della portata di eventuali sabotatori, il ?lanternaio? (lanternarius), che doveva far luce con una lanterna issata su una lunga pertica, dato che il lavoro si svolgeva, com naturale, preferibilmente di notte, e un generico ?assistente? (adstans) che poteva essere addetto al trasporto di secchi e pennelli e ad incombenze sussidiarie, compresa quella di far da ?palo? contro possibili avversari, concorrenti e malintenzionati in genere.    La relativa facilit con cui il lavoro poteva essere svolto faceva s che per la campagna elettorale si formassero anche squadre ausiliarie di ?scrittori? improvvisati e volontari. Non risulta che ci fosse alcun luogo o spazio espressamente predisposto dalle autorit per scrivere i ?manifesti?;  facile pertanto immaginare che ogni muro della citt poteva diventare preda degli scriptores. E pure ovvio che i ?manifesti? dovevano addensarsi lungo le vie pi importanti e nei luoghi pi frequentati, senza troppo rispetto per monumenti ed edifici pubblici, mostre e insegne di botteghe, edicole e immagini sacre, e coinvolgendo anche le tombe che, allineate lungo le vie suburbane, mostravano le loro facciate a chiunque usciva o entrava attraverso le porte della citt. E per questo che in certe epigrafi funerarie il rispetto dei luoghi consacrati alla morte era espressamente richiesto, con preghiere e lusinghe oppure con minacce e maledizioni: ?Tu che scrivi sui muri, ti prego, passa oltre questo monumento; il candidato il cui nome sar qui scritto, faccia fiasco e non sia mai pi eletto ad alcuna carica?; oppure, al contrario:    ?Possa il tuo candidato essere eletto e sii tu felice, o scrittore, se qui non scriverai?.    Purtroppo nemmeno una traccia di ?manifesti? elettorali  rimasta a Roma: troppo facilmente deperibili essi erano. E, soprattutto, per troppi secoli  durante tutta let imperiale  non essendo stati pi eseguiti, una volta venuta meno ogni necessit di farli. Di ?manifesti? elettorali invece se ne sono trovati circa 1500, variamente conservati (e molti, malauguratamente, ?svaniti? dopo la scoperta) a Pompei, dove leruzione del Vesuvio pose un drammatico e repentino suggello alla vita quotidiana in pieno svolgimento.   Dimenticavo all'imperatore: bastava un semplice gesto, senza dover parlare...  ciaooo ombre
c1959faa19be9096a61470c6cfb5b72daa	Severus Snape,muito conhecido como professor Snape, nasceu em 9 de janeiro de 1960 da uni?o de uma feiticeira, Eileen Prince (que quando jovem, era Capit? da Equipe das Bexigas) com um Trouxa, Tobias Snape, e teve seu nascimento divulgado no Profeta Dirio pouco depois do casamento deles.  Ou seja, ele  um bruxo mesti?o.    No Stimo Livro (Reliquias da Morte), Severo Snape  nomeado por Lorde Voldemort, diretor da escola de magia e bruxaria "Hogwarts" (Onde ficou entre Julho de 1997 e Junho de 1998), substituindo Alvo Dumbledore, a quem foi fil durante mais de 16 anos. Foi o primeiro diretor de Hogwarts Sonserino desde Fineus Nigellus. Durante seu tempo no comando da escola, a matria "Defesa Contra as Artes das Trevas" passa a se chamar "Artes das Trevas", e a matria de "Estudo dos Trouxas"  ensinada por uma comensal da morte. Alm disso, outros comensais da morte formam os "Carrows", pessoas que ficam dentro de Hogwarts, aplicando puni??es, denten??es, etc.    Gina, Neville e Luna Lovegood tentam roubar a Espada de Griffinoria da sala do diretor, mas n?o conseguem e acabam tendo que ir na Floresta Proibida com Hagrid, que  escurra?ado logo depois. O que os garotos n?o sabem  que se trata de uma falsa espada, pois a verdadeira havia sido guardada por Dumbledore, pouco antes de sua morte.    Fineus Nigellus, diretor de Hogwarts que fica nos quadros, que obedecia as ordens de Severo Snape com muito orgulho por ele ser o nico diretor sonserino depois dele, descobre onde Harry, Rony e Hermione est?o escondidos. E mais uma vez Snape mostrando novamente sua lealdade incondicional a Dumbledore, leva a Espada de Gryffindor a Harry e seus amigos para destruirem o medalh?o de Sonserina, uma Horcrux.    Para conseguir que todos pensem (inclusive o prprio Lorde das Trevas) que ele  totalmente fil a Lorde Voldemort, ele deixa a escola ser trasformada em uma anarquia, apenas com alunos de sangue bruxo ou mesti?o, porm ele n?o se sente bem fazendo tais absurdos. Durante todo seu ano na dire??o Dumbledore, de seu quadro na sala do diretor, d instru??es de como prosseguir com a longa miss?o de proteger Harry.

20cf7d53ed1b338fda7b51af5f47642faa	Sem dvida  o prprio homem que se torna inimigo. Caberia tambm perguntar, por que homem prejudica a si mesmo e os outros.    Vejamos a concep??o de Hobbes h vrios sculos a respeito sobre o tema:    "As express?es pelas quais Hobbes o descreve s?o clebres: "Homo homini lupus", o homem  o lobo do homem; "Bellum omnium contra omnes",  a guerra de todos contra todos. N?o pensemos que mesmo os homens mais robustos desfrutem tranqilamente as vitrias que sua for?a lhe assegura. Aquele que possui grande for?a muscular n?o est ao abrigo da astcia do mais fraco. Este ltimo - por maquina??o secreta ou a partir de hbeis alian?as - sempre  o suficientemente forte para vencer o mais forte. Por conseguinte, ao invs de uma desigualdade,  uma espcie de igualdade dos homens no estado natural que faz sua infelicidade. Pois, em definitivo, ningum est protegido; o estado natural , para todos, um estado de inseguran?a e de angstia.      Assim sendo, o homem sempre tem medo de ser morto ou escravizado e esse temor, em ltima instancia mais poderoso do que o orgulho,  a paix?o que vai dar a palavra  raz?o. (Essa psicologia da vaidade e do medo , em Hobbes, uma espcie de laiciza??o da oposi??o teolgica entre o orgulho espiritual e o temor a Deus ou humildade.)  o medo, portanto, que vai obrigar os homens a fundarem um estado social e a autoridade poltica.      Os homens, portanto, v?o se encarregar de estabelecer a paz e a seguran?a. S haver paz concretizvel se cada um renunciar ao direito absoluto que tem sobre todas as coisas. Isto s ser possvel se cada um abdicar de seus direitos absolutos em favor de um soberano que, ao herdar os direitos de todos, ter um poder absoluto. N?o existe a a interven??o de uma exigncia moral. Simplesmente o medo  maior do que a vaidade e os homens concordam em transmitir todos os seus poderes a um soberano. Quanto a este ltimo, notemo-lo bem, ele  o senhor absoluto desde ent?o, mas n?o possui o menor compromisso em rela??o a seus sditos.      Seu direito n?o tem outro limite que seu poder e sua vontade. No estado de sociedade, como no de natureza, a for?a  a nica medida do direito. No estado social, o monoplio da for?a pertence ao soberano. Houve, da parte de cada indivduo, uma atemorizada renncia do seu prprio poder. Mas n?o houve pacto nem contrato, o que houve, como diz Halbwachs, foi "uma aliena??o e n?o uma delega??o de poderes". O efeito comum do poder consistir, para todos, na seguran?a, uma vez que o soberano ter, de fato, o maior interesse em fazer reinar a ordem se quiser permanecer no poder. Apesar de tudo, esse poder absoluto permanece um poder de fato que encontrar seus limites no dia em que os sditos preferirem morrer do que obedecer. Em todo caso, esta  a origem psicolgica que Hobbes atribui ao poder desptico. Ele chama de Leviat? ao seu estado totalitrio em lembran?a de uma passagem da Bblia (J XLI) em que tal palavra designa um animal monstruoso, cruel e invencvel que  o rei dos orgulhosos."|`|2252b022e0b94e0b8102d3f2c6260c62aa	O seu CEREBRO, quando se deixa levar pela maldade.

J pelo tratamento que te dou, podes verificar que creio, baseado nas vrias religi?es existentes, e principalmente no esoterismo, que TODOS NS SOMOS UM COM O PRINCIPIO CREADOR, OU DEUS. Que como energia pura que , irradia smente AMOR, LUZ, PAZ,  SABEDORIA, ABUND?NCIA, etc, etc. Acontece que, para que DEUS pudesse ser reconhecido como o SER SUPREMO, precisou se MANIFESTAR. Portanto somos a manifesta??o de DEUS, com LEIS IMUTVEIS que devemos respeitar, para nos aproximar-mos DELE, entre elas a LEI DE A??O E REA??O, dentro do LIVRE ARBITRIO (escolhas) que temos o direito de fazer, durante nossa jornada evolutiva. E o resultado do uso mau ou bom da LEI, gera o que se chama CARMA (que pode ser negativo ou positivo para ns). Atualmente estamos vivendo um FIM DE CICLO, e todo fim de CICLO, traz o fim de uma civiliza??o, para que outra mais evoluida, inicie um NOVO CICLO. Nos fins de ciclo, a maioria dos humanos que n?o evoluiram espiritualmente o suficiente para permanecer no planeta, s?o exilados para planetas mais primitivos, onde ter?o oportunidade de evoluir novamente. Na realidade meu caro irm?o de jornada, o espa?o aqui  muito pequeno, pois o assunto requer uma explana??o maior, para um bom entendimento. Ns estamos vivendo a poca em que a humanidade deixou-se levar pelo EGOISMO E PELO ORGULHO. A consequencia a est. Procure a DIVINA PRESEN?A DO CRISTO EM SEU CORA??O, PORQUE ELE EST A.

Spero di averti aiutato!|`|gRGbAywwaa	Credo vadano di pari passo|`|AyNt45joaa	l'intuizione  un idea concreta ovvero una sensazione che si trasforma quasi in verit,come un colpo di genio.mentre la sensazione appunto si basa sui sensi e nn  verificabile concretamente come realt certa!|`|f402c72ec65f49566728718ee6568244aa	Bella domanda. Allora sensazione, e' quando nei riguardi di una determinata situazione tu senti al livello di pelle, una sensazione appunto che essa ti trasmette.per esempio "calore", dolcezza" ed il contrario. Per esempio minnacia, pericolo.  Intuizione e' quando secondo i dati che hai accumulato nella tua vita secondo la tua personale conoscenza, tu senza una chiarezza(perche nessuno dice la verita')su una situazione, riesci a individuarla.  Per esempio. Io non sono ne di destra ne di sinistra ma portare leggi (poligamia) che alla fine discriminano i diritti umani, intuisco che porta alla distruzione di ogni dignit,  perche la compromette. Era un esempio (che mi sta al cuore).  Spero di esserti stata di aiuto, ciao :)|`|8CcyBFVXaa	secondo me la sfumatura d significati nn p molta ma l'intuizione dovrebbe essere pi basata da qualcosa d fatto o ver.-es.anke un ragionamento lo puoi intuire invece una sensazione  qualcosa d pi astratto indefinito basato suull'emotivit,cmq niente d concreto, su un'apparenza!!!questo  quello ke posso dirti x avere info pi precise dovresti avere un manuale d filosofia..|`|Oh5llwXfaa	L'intuizione e quello che pensi,la senzazione e quello che senti senso e pensiero|`|HAEWcY42aa	ormai nel gergo odierno i due termini hanno la stessa valenza..  devi sapere che, invece, nell'antichit i due termini avevano due concezioni differenti  la sensazione  la percezione delle cose concrete attraverso i cinque sensi (olfatto, udito, vista, gusto, tatto); l'intuizione  invece un ulteriore passo in avanti nel cammino di conoscenza: attraverso il metodo induttivo si arriva, partendo dalla sensazione, a "percepire" il mondo "astratto"...  mery...  ps: se vuoi approfondire.. leggiti qualche libro di filosofia antica (in particolare platone e aristotele)|`|TQhZoLd8aa	In verit sarebbero due cose distinte.  Nel senso comune,  Intuizione risiede nella facolt dell'Intelletto..."intuiamo" per mezzo di "idee"....Uno strumento a-priori rispetto ad ogni esperienza.  Sensazione risiede nella facolt della Sensibilit.   Legata all'esperienza..."sentiamo", avvertiamo che sta per succedere qualcosa....il corpo ce lo suggerisce...."un brivido nella pancia"...un tremore...il sudore....  Filosoficamente invece Intuizione  "il rapporto diretto [cio privo di intermediari] con un oggetto qualsiasi: rapporto che perci implica la presenza effettiva dell'oggetto*".   Citando Plotino -che usa il termine per designare la conoscenza immediata e totale che l' Intelletto divino ha di s e dei suoi propri oggetti- l'Intuizione  una forma di conoscenza superiore e privilegiata; giacch ad essa, come alla visione sensibile su cui si modella, l'oggetto  immediatamente presente.  Sensazione ha due significati fondamentali:  1] designa la totalit della conoscenza sensibile, "cio tutti e ognuno i suoi costituenti**";  2] designa gli elementi della conoscenza sensibile, "cio le parti ultime indivisibili da cui essa  si suppone costituita***".|`|ae86290c39d434a27bb706f7418b534daa	Ad esempio io a questa domanda non s  veramente se quello che ti scrivo  giusto o meno....per vado "a sensazione", cio sento che quello che ti scrivo potrebbe, ma non  detto che sia cos', essere giusto;  invece l'intuizione  pi un qualcosa d'astratto, che non c' nella realt oggettiva!!...ma bens in quella soggettiva!!!...Questo  il mio pensiero al riguardo...saluti|`|03fedb969ba4954a3d2d4a64a341a82eaa	intuizione  certezza, in quanto  sinonimo di capire, quindi si parla di una cosa reale,concreta.    sensazione  qualcosa di astratto,  una percezione della tua persona su un qualcosa (persona o oggetto), ma nn hai basi o riferimenti a cui allegare il tuo essere nel momento in cui hai una sensazione.    es:  ho la sensazione che oggi piova (perch si vedono le nuvole nn vuol dire che portino pioggia,  un tuo pensiero su un qualcose che potrebbe accadere ma nn ne sei certo)    due persone parlano, te passi vicino e ascoltando parte del discorso intuisci a chi o che cosa fanno riferimento(questo perch gli elementi dati dalle due persone nel discorso sono reali, ti danno una matematica certezza che si riferiscano o ad una persona/luogo/oggetto/evento che te naturalmente conosci, altrimenti nn avresti intuito di cosa parlavano)

Hay    Existe uma cren?a, bastante difundida, de que as doen?as s se manifestam quando pensamos nelas. Da mesma forma, cultivar padr?es mentais negativos  um passo para a evolu??o de doen?as ou sentimentos nocivos. Segundo Louise L. Hay,  preciso haver uma perfeita sintonia, entre a mente e o corpo. Assim, se a sade n?o anda bem, as raz?es devem ser buscadas, no desequilbrio dessas duas for?as, n?o bastando o ataque frontal a determinada doen?a. Molstias srias como o Cancer (uma doen?a que a autora se curou), a Aids, as cardiopatias, e at mesmo um simples resfriado, tm seus sintomas agravados, pelos padr?es mentais herdados que, acumulados durante longo tempo, reagem negativamente no organismo. Livro imperdvel para quem busca auto-conhecimento e cura.  ********************    O Relatrio Hite - Um profundo estudo sobre a sexualidade feminina , de Shere Hite    de autoria da historiadora americana Shere Hite, abordando temas que at ent?o eram tabu para ser discutidos publicamente. Na pesquisa em que o livro foi baseado, as mulheres afirmavam que ternura e intimidade eram mais importantes que orgasmo. E diziam que o contato dos corpos e as preliminares valiam mais que a penetra??o. O documento abriu uma nova frente de pesquisas que hoje busca aprofundar o entendimento da sexualidade da mulher.  //////////////    O guardi?o da meia noite - Rubens Saraceni    Ao ler esta obra, voc estar entrando num mundo que deve ser sentido, explorado e vivido e que tem a inten??o de fazlo evoluir na sabedoria do conhecimento Divino.

Lo letto tutto di un fiato e mi e piaciuto molto, come spesso accade il film che ne e stato tratto non rende bene i ritmi del libro e la suspence che si crea durante la lettura del libro, in molti momenti il film  fa ridere e non paura, mentre nel libro e molto difficile che ridi ma rimani legato alla attesa di cosa succedera. La cosa migliore e comunque leggere il libro e poi decidere da solo se ti fa paura o no.|`|tz9XLvLHaa	Ma noo.... leggilo!

0HAn67yZaa	young Name Meaning and History  English, Scottish, and northern Irish: distinguishing name (Middle English yunge, yonge young), for the younger of two bearers of the same personal name, usually distinguishing a younger brother or a son. In Middle English this name is often found with the Anglo-Norman French definite article, for example Robert le Yunge.   Americanization of a cognate, equivalent, or like-sounding surname in some other language, notably German Jung and Junk, Dutch (De) Jong(h) and Jong, and French Lejeune and LaJeunesse.   assimilated form of French Dion or Guyon.   Chinese: see Yang.|`|c06f9e62b2e3de70492245a069ccbf6aaa	I found this for you.    Surname: Young  This interesting surname is of Anglo-Saxon pre 7th century origin, and as such is one of the earliest known origins. The derivation is from the word 'geong', which developed into the Middle English 'yunge or yonge', and literally means 'The young one'. Curiously children of the same sex in a medieval family were often given the same name, and to differentiate them a byname would be created and given (usually) to the younger bearers of the name baptismal name! The word was also used as a nickname for one who was 'young in heart', or appeared young, as in the example below. The surname is first recorded in the late 13th century, and from this developed the modern spelling forms which include Young, Younge, Youngs, Yong , Yonge and Ong(e). Early recordings include that of Wilferd seo Iunge, (Wilfred the son of Young) in the 744 a.d. Anglo-Saxon Chronicles, although this is not as a surname, whilst Richard le Yunge of Lichfield, Staffordshire, in 1301, strongly suggests a descriptive nickname which may not have become hereditary. Later recordings taken from the church registers include the marriage of Edmond Young and Katharyn Wendover on September 14th 1568, at Sudbury, and the christening of George, son of William and Frances Young on October 17th 1652 at St. James, Clerkenwell, London. One of the earliest settlers in the colonies of 'New England' was Nathaniell Young, who sailed from the Port of London, aboard the the ship 'Constance', bound for 'Virginea' on October 15th 1635. The first recorded spelling of the family name is shown to be that of Walter Yonge, which was dated 1296 in the Subsidy Rolls of Sussex, during the reign of King Edward 1, known as 'The Hammer of the Scots', 1272 - 1307. Surnames became necessary when governments introduced personal taxation. In England this was known as Poll Tax. Throughout the centuries, surnames in every country have continued to "develop" often leading to astonishing variants of the original spelling.   Hope this helps.
oclvWDzPaa	I think i would use it defiantly! If u think, students could use this for there school reports and story's....and many upcoming writers could be judged.... and many upcoming writers could be found!!!! I would defiantly use this for my school reports. it would save a lot of editing time and get the opinions of others b4 u get the teacher's opinion... the 1 that counts!!!|`|0aEYjVzMaa	i think i'd use it - it sounds like it's been done before though|`|AA12160009	I would be intrigued but not drawn in.Besides, there are a lot of sites that share the same concept. Sharing stories, editing, all that stuff. I just think that its another one of those sites that gives you nothing in return. Just saying, its ok but not absolutely curious to my mind.    Hope I could help!|`|SeKR3zncaa	Sounds good but its already been done. . .its called fictionpress.com and runs along the same lines as fanfiction.com except that its for original works.|`|2Sjn4B9eaa	Sure, it looks fun.
YmtNel5haa	The basic social contract theory says that you need to release some of your autonomy(in this case a small amount of personal freedom) in exchange for the services that the government provides for you.  It doesn't matter if you don't get a choice because it's something that you are born into.  We actually have it a lot better than a lot of countries.  That is not to say that we have as much as we always have, because we don't.  But times change, we may never go back, we only have now, and if you don't like something you can do something about it.  Actually there are a lot of things you can do, but what you chose to do is what counts.|`|HrsPCzaBaa	*Depends on the person .  *If it is within their moral beliefs to obey it then to themselves they are obligated.   *Their beliefs, morals, ethics, opinions etc.  *As far as their soul beliefs desire it to.  *Of course.|`|Is4WhwzZaa	I think that you do.  Knowing right from wrong.  Chaos is the answer if we do not.  Think of what it would be like if we all decided not to obey the law.  IT is there to create order.  You might not know the reason for everything, but there is sure to be.  Some could be out dated and no longer valid.  Like driving a herd of pigs through main street, spitting on the sidewalk, etc.  But in their day, there were reasons for the law.      I think if you strongly believe the law is wrong, you should work within the system to change it.|`|VJoN49bfaa	while you may feel a certain moral obligation to obey the law that is because the law and your own personal ethos are in alignment. most laws (especially in democracies) are beneficial to society, but more importantly the state has tremendous power to make your life a living hell. so your obligation to follow the law is your obligation to protect yourself.  While I believe that one should attempt to undo an unjust law, as long as you have power in the system you should attempt to work within it to change the law, not act outside of it.|`|H23SiRRwaa	Personally I'm sick of all these laws that inhibit my personal freedoms ! Why don't they just pass a law that says you can go to work go home eat a salad and go to bed that's it . Laws are just made up crap to control and collect money, and that should be illegal. One day they'll get what's coming to them , it's happened before . Sure some laws are good like murder and stealing but everybody knows if you got enough money you can get out of it with a slap on the wrist.

YGezcAvpaa	Aww.. Esme Cullen is amazing. I love almost all of the Twilight Saga characters. Esme is so sweet and caring, she is the perfect mother and/or friend. I love how she is always so polite and welcoming.    Each Cullen is perfect in their own ways. I love them all.|`|zrRx8UvWaa	I mean she doesnt have a big part to play so her character does not get to shine throught as much as some others. But she is a very caring person.|`|Tj2xROpwaa	I like her but I like Alice and Carsile more|`|N0YH5RRuaa	Yeah, she is pretty cool. Alice is better though.|`|G3czAd0caa	i think u r  my guy friend has a crush on her though|`|7vc53Y7zaa	she is pretty awesome|`|GmGogzsXaa	i like her but i like jasper, alice and edward more    =]|`|VlaX0Rfmaa	Haha, she's pretty cool.

e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	Take pictures of her slowly getting wet...  hair style falling down, make up beginning to run, shirt getting wet. But her lips will still be perfect along with her smile.  Depending on what angle your shooting the rain will actually give you soft focus background (if raining hard enough).    Make sure she is tall enough to be able to stand in puddles without drowning  LOL    Can also take picture of her face from other side of car roof and get decent reflection...  just be creative|`|1YBo8yhOaa	I agree with SheTa, but I would add a back ground of a flowering shrub or flowering vines.  The soft focus effect of the rain will have the effect of a varied pastel background to compliment your model.  Color coordinate the models cloths with the flower color to knit the image together.
LXJNeUmaaa	Breaking Dawn !  :D|`|ekeDv2oRaa	OMG I LOVE TWILIGT + THE SAGA SOOOOO MUCH U DONT EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH i cant even choose but i'l go in order   first of all i cant even choose I LOVEEEEE TWILIGHT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Twilight, Midnight sun, Breaking Dawn and eclipse, new moon there all the same way but any ways IM THE BIGGEST TWILIGHT FAN IN DA WORLD|`|6YG94vu0aa	-Twilight: enjoyable, crappy writing, not the best book ever, but it's good.   -New Moon: I only liked Jacob. Bella was a mayor stupid in that book. She was going to kill herself for a guy. It gives a bad message, girls should be able to forget and go on with their lives.   -Eclipse: Bad message(teen marriage and how she accepted to marry him just to have sex),I hated how they forgot everything Jacob did for them and when they called him DOG!   -Breaking Dawn: Bad message(teen pregnancy and marriage and pedophiles), it seemed like she wanted to make the perfect ending, PERFECT ENDINGS ARE NOT COOL, They are boring, predictable and just plain stupid. She didn't have to sacrifice ANYTHING! 3 book talking about sacrifice and at the end... NOTHING!   -Midnight Sun: Haven't read it yet, but why would I want to read the same story again? I imagine it... "I thirsted for her blood, it smelled so good!!"    so... I'll have to go with Twilight.|`|Kh6LI1mNaa	i don't like them nearly as much i used to becuz of the annoying fan girls and i realized they aren't that great in the first place   but here is my order in how i liked them   New Moon and Eclipse tie   Twilight   Breaking Dawn this book was so bad i couldn't even finsh it and i cried for days at how bad it was vampires cannot have babies (Edward is dead and how does venom act like sprem wtf but i guess people 12 and younger liked it because they don't know a good book if it hit them in the ***)|`|Lpe0sz7xaa	My favorite was deffinatly Breaking Dawn! It was soo good (: I can't wait for Midnight Sun to come out!|`|Qk3RWHntaa	Midnight Sun or Twilight, definitely.  I hated Breaking Dawn. Hated. It was a horrible ending to an otherwise amazing series. Meyer made up for with Midnight Sun, though.|`|EO3o6ACvaa	Midnight sun is no longer being published...    For me Twilight as it opens up to this wondrous world,  Just like a flower thats about to bloom. Twilight is the very new bud, and It opened up in to one of the most wondrous things I read in 2008.|`|KK3R6CjYaa	This is my order;    Twilight  Midnight sun  Breaking Dwan  Eclipse   New moon    Twilight is my favorite becasue it's the book that started  thsi whole thing, It's the book that brought them together and Theres so much action and love in it.|`|yjQOeuTGaa	I read all the books, but first, even for me, romance is too slow for something to read about, and none of the books (but the first) had very much action in them.|`|vSTtAfOWaa	Breaking Dawn.  I think of them all as one big story but if I had to pick I would pick Breaking Dawn, because so much happens.  I don't know about Midnight Sun yet. I've read the beginning I was very hooked so I can't wait in till it is published!|`|E9KYlG9kaa	Tough question!  I guess Breaking Dawn and Midnight Sun tie.|`|dUChouI5aa	I really loved Eclipse first because it gives most of the understanding regarding the reason Wuthering Heights always comes up in the books.  Also, It has the most action for me, and explains a lot more.  If you re-read it, you'll understand what i mean.  I love then in the following order:    -Eclipse  -Breaking Dawn and Twilight (TIE)  -Midnight Sun  -New Moon    They were all REALLY good!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|gnhl6hXYaa	umm...  i dont really know! i love them all not so much new moon cus it was pretty boring without edward : / but  i guess its a tie between the first book twilight. mostly because it leaves you with so much suspence!  and breaking dawn because its where they get their happily ever after.  :D|`|oUjQQvcgaa	eww! twilight sucks and is a horrible rendition for vampires! it's just a stupid teen angst romance!|`|ZbNCdS8qaa	Breaking dawn definetley!|`|zF8Jsx33aa	all of them i cant decide :P|`|3d0512a158369fd82c304a8c1f4e0dc1aa	Eclipse.|`|XGzC67P5aa	New Moon cuz Eddys not there......................................

HXuuuLNOaa	are you really asking others this question  or is it reflective ?  cos i think the question is not   what are we good at...or have acheived ??    but what you think you are / or could be.....and what you want to acheive ?    life is not just about acheivement in a manner of status, money or materialism.........but you can get them !  it is more about what you learn about yourself and others, in relationships and life in general.    how many ' acheivers ' in the money sense; are really popular ?  yet those who make life good for others, and are remembered will have 100's of people turning up to their funeral !    its a sobering thought?    anyway,.......about you !  what are you good at ?  what do you want to acheive ?  your future (and us all ) is not measured by what we do today.....but what we will do tomorrow......and the next day........ad infinitum !    do yourself a favour.....  make a ' balance sheet ' ( pros and cons ) of what you are now good at ?  add all the plus points.......and the negatives  relate them to what you would like to acheive  say in a job ?  if youre no good with people....it will show  if you are....so it will too  if youre good with comoutors, maths, science etc  these things will enable you to determine a path you may wish to take fully knowing you have the skills, rather than not    do what you are good at; and enjoy  life and acheivement are far easier that way    and remember, everyone has something good in them  everyone has potential  find yours and go for it !!    but it must be a continual learning and developmental process  each day or year.....the same as the last.......  is a missed opportunity  live and work each day/year.......as a new year  you learn more; get further in life, and enjoy everything better !    as ' forest gump' said ' life is like a box of chocolates......but you never know what you are gonna get '' !|`|FoIxsunVaa	1.

TRL9LNcSaa	Hey im a fellow actor myself and here are some tips:  1) go out for auditions and DONT BE NERVOUS!!!  2)If you get into a play, highlight all your lines, and practice them everyday  3)Experiment with different character voices/attitudes/appearance (thats where the real fun is!:)  4)Each time you go to actng classes and auditions, it may not feel like it, but you ARE growing as an actor  5) Thats another thing, go to as many classes as possibly, its impossible to pratice too much with acting  6) Its good that you get into character around the house, that shows that you are interested and that you have the mental ability to get into character!|`|Y6BFsic4aa	To really get the character of an actor you need to think of the time, setting, and the character.

v6KqicByaa	i dont know about u guyz in high school but im in 8th grd, n we started with life under Britains control, the taxes, Boston tea party, then to the revolution, the battles, and leaders, and we went through the presidents, and the war of 1812, and the french revolution. we learned about the rising of the federalists and antifederalists, the federalists and democratic republicans, how the federalist party fell, the whigs, and the election of 1824. and the industrial revolution. and the revolutions of Latin america and how that affected the US. and the Lousiana purchase, and indians, and a lot more! youre probably gonna learn the same thing but go deeper into it!|`|xQYxSvYraa	you talk about everything begining with the aztecs and european settlers..to all of the big wars..am. rev. civil war both world wars...you cover all of the presidents except for g.w. bush but im in a p and my book goes up to clinton so idk.|`|NR5lqcwtaa	ok i just took it as a senior in NC so heres the deal  you go from nomads   to  today   no certin points to cover here in my neck of the woods  but then again we do take eoc's here end of course tests so we have to know everything|`|OpZehgpwaa	u start and the revolution. and u get every president every war and every erafrom the revolution till today.|`|9zwSclnLaa	I am a freshman & we are learning everything from prehistory [from the beginning of when humans first appeared] all the way up until WWII.

E8XhWvdqaa	Yes, you definitely want to have your leotard tights and shoes ready. Obviously if you're just beginning, you won't be wearing pointe shoes. Definitely stretch before the class to avoid injuries.  Depending on how strict the school is you can have some leeway in your attire. The best way to go is black leotard, pink tights, and pink ballet slippers. You should check the website for further guidelines about that. Also, make sure your hair is up in a ponytail or bun. For a beginner class either is probably fine because you won't be doing a ton of quick turns or anything that would make your hair whack into your face. : )    Lastly, be prepared to not be great at it the first time. Don't be dissapointed if you aren't amazing. Ballet is really hard and it takes a long time to be good.     It's really great that you are trying it! It's fantastic exercise, good for being less clumsy : ), and just a really great experience! I've been doing it for almost ten years, and I just love it!|`|ZWaRNMzVaa	-Exercise  -Wear leotard and tights and ballet shoes|`|4scMHGGvaa	For a definite wear pink tights,a black bodysuit, and ballet shoes. Have your hair pulled back in a bun or ponytail. You will probably do barre work,which is like tendus,plies,grand plies,fondu, ect. You might also do some things down or across the floor...like pirouettes and leaps. Stretch as much as you can!      GOOD LUCK!!|`|YL8tTemwaa	ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm???|`|0aEYjVzMaa	yea, have all that ready.  pink tights are usually standard, but different places require different colored leotards.  if your not sure what color, go with just a black leotard.  and you need your shoes.    that dance class might help, it depends on how much you remember.  to get ready you should do some simple stretches that help you gain flexibility and strength.    on the first day of class it depends on whether everyone else is a beginner, or if they've done it for a couple of years.|`|QP9Gxi0jaa	If you do end up needing a leotard, there is a great website that I found http://foxysfitnessfashions.com/ They have a great selection and good prices.|`|wMXKOPjaaa	hi  to get prepared just stretch a lot, and also do a few warm up moves like plies, tondus etc.  on the first day you will probably learn exercises on the barre, like plies, tondus, fondus, gronde battemonts etc. (pardon my spelling)  yes it would be good to have your gear ready but if you can't they'll probably will forgive you, since it's the first lesson.  hope i helped!

05c920c9f1b5e4deb703e24090ba3744aa	Agreed,Stalin was brutal but he did what needed to be done. He killed anyone who opposed him,there were mass executions of political opponents,but ultimately he was an affective leader.     He was able to put the Soviet Union back into the world stage.His massive cultivation programs were successful, but often times the workers had to lie about the product numbers to avoid punishment.     There was a huge emphasis on everyone being a family and working for the greater good,it was communism on steroids. Ultimately the Soviet Union made the transition to an industrial power. And in World War 2, when the Soviets were caught off guard,their sheer economy and the now well organized work force took on Germany.     And by the end of World War 2, the Soviet Union had pretty much created it's own sphere of influence. He weakened the moral standing of the government through the mass executions of opponents,but he overall made the nation much stronger.|`|vYgJMybeaa	Well he industrialized the USSR at the expense of some odd million people    Russia was a really poor country prior to this, but the improvements he made "modernized" Russia from serfdom to an industrial power    But purging the red army wasnt a very smart move. Eventually they did win the war but it was more the brutal conditions of Russia's climate that helped them rather than what Stalin did (I mean specifically operation barbarossa which changed the direction of the war to the allied forces)     Afterwards the USSR emerged as a superpower
HUDjXVOyaa	What is in it for me? You want me to give up an airbrush to some one who just feels like it? Are you joking?     Who are you? Where do you come from? Where were you educated?     Why don't you seek out some friends who share your dream   of making a living individually.     Ever heard the fraze "strenghth in numbers?" Why don't you join up with a group of friend and buy an airbrush together. Share the airbrush?     It is much easier to get donations if you are part of a group or greater organization. It is important to show to others that you believe in something greater than your self. It helps you move ahead.     "You give what you recieve." If you donate to other causes you can advertise that you did. It will help you to show buyers that you support the local community,..aka resualting in buyer believe in your own company.     Humans were ment to operate as a group. Individuals die.

It will not happen so why waste your time and energy and ours with such useless thoughts and questions. Use your time for understanding what life is really all about.

If you go back in time to execute an action, then you can't actually do it. If you did it then you would have no reason to go back and do it, therefore it would have never happened. So, if you were to go back in time, it would be for pure observation with no reason for why you are there.|`|FF9mMlgKaa	you still live but a copy of you is never born.|`|zzO6Qalsaa	yes totally weird dude.|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Time is the stream of flowing temporal events perceived by creature consciousness. Time is a name given to the succession-arrangement whereby events are recognized and segregated. The universe of space is a time-related phenomenon as it is viewed from any interior position outside of the fixed abode of Paradise. The motion of time is only revealed in relation to something which does not move in space as a time phenomenon. In the universe of universes Paradise and its Deities transcend both time and space. On the inhabited worlds, human personality (indwelt and oriented by the Paradise Father's spirit) is the only physically related reality which can transcend the material sequence of temporal events.              Animals do not sense time as does man, and even to man, because of his sectional and circumscribed view, time appears as a succession of events; but as man ascends, as he progresses inward, the enlarging view of this event procession is such that it is discerned more and more in its wholeness. That which formerly appeared as a succession of events then will be viewed as a whole and perfectly related cycle; in this way will circular simultaneity increasingly displace the onetime consciousness of the linear sequence of events.    In short if your going anywhere it will be forward or not at all.|`|AA11736322	it is your philosophy only you can understand|`|8ekoa6szaa	This question is unanswerable, but try watching some reruns of an old show called Quantum Leap if possible.  The writers came up with some really twisted plots, but behind every one of them was the idea that you could NOT do anything that would change history.    Me?  I want to go back to June of 1967 and go on to college and get a degree in psychology instead of getting married and having a baby. Yet, I love my daughter and grandson better than life itself, so if i don't get married and get pregnant when I did, I would be changing my own personal history and that isn't allowed by the rules of Quantum Leap.  Food for thought, huh?

GnfgawaYaa	walk[ing] heavily, dragging his feet a little, the way a bear drags his paws (description of lennie pg. 4 imagery.. when he describes him walking like this you picture him slow with poor posture and so forth.. steinbeck is known for animal imagery)    Dramatic irony is when the words and actions of the characters of a work of literature have a different meaning for the reader than they do for the characters. This is the result of the reader having a greater knowledge than the characters themselves.      Situational Irony occurs in literature and in drama when persons and events come together in improbable situations, creating a tension between expected and real results. An example of this would be a scene where a man and woman are sitting at a bus stop and start to converse. The woman divulges some of her deepest darkest secrets. The man listens and advises her, and the woman thanks him and gets on her bus. After she is gone the man takes off his heavy coat to reveal that he is in fact wearing the garb of a priest. The irony lies in the fact that the woman never knew that the man she was talking to was a priest, but the audience does and the reality of what the audience knows about why the man was so helpful and understanding is different from the reality the woman experienced    Idioms are words, phrases, or expressions that cannot be taken literally (like when you tell someone to "break a leg")    tragedy -- self explainable    Symbols are people, places, or things used to represent somehing else in literature. (like in "Tom Sawyer," the treasure represents the end of the boys' journey and Tom's transition into manhood)    Hope this helps.|`|xJoMSkI5aa	While Of Mice and Men occurs in a very specific time and place, each of the characters can be thought of as symbolizing broader populations. Though the book is not an allegory, and each character can stand alone as simply a character, there's still something to be gained by looking at each character as representative of their larger group. Here we go.    From Shmoop/Of Mice and Men
XXc15qzzaa	I suppose it's ironic since it's Curly who likes to spout how tough he is and Lennie is the softer soul. Yet when it comes down to it, in a man's world (which is what OMAM is supposed to depict) the stronger trump the weaker in general.  Later though it's the brains of Curly (and attitude) that trump Lennie's size. Once again: harsh reality.|`|7eEEIJlcaa	yes i think it is because when reading it you would think that curley is the mean one who is always looking for trouble yet when him and lennie get in a fight lennie breaks his hand even though lennie is the nice, kind hearted one who didnt even mean to hurt him  i hope this helps!|`|pIDd2y8Xaa	not really. irony is him killing the puppies. he loves them so much that he breaks their necks. violence that inadvertently stems from love.
YL8tTemwaa	What???
Jx3TG0keaa	yes. when a book is sad or moving i will be balling my eyes out. when Edward left Bella I sat there in tears for an hour lol. and the next morning after reading everything in first person i thought i really was Bella Swan and wake up and said "wheres edward!!??" LMAO i kid you not.     and i think its perfectly healthy. i mean its better than obsessing over a real boy and getting hurt.  but i mean if your to the point where you wont date unless he's and exact replica of Edward then thats unhealthy my friends.     and i crave that love too. your not alone. I have a boyfriend who is absolutely amazing but sometimes ya know it's just like "WHY CANT YOU BE LIKE EDWARD!!" never the less i love him to death. everyones gunna find there own Edward some day though. ( the super weird thing about me and his relationship is that he wants to be a vampire lol!)|`|AA12160009	I think you should see the movie. You may not fall in love with Robert Pattinson but you can certainly hear the girls screaming. I would just like to say that girls are obsessed with Pattinson's looks and Cullen's character. I mean, he has some powerful connection to Bella and won't look at another woman with a smirk and wonder what is under those clothes. I think Jacob is just so pushy and I know that he is younger but really. The movie did pretty well but I only read the book after I saw the movie. They combined parts and skipped some like the blood scene in science class.  So I love the Cullens with all their unique personalities and powers. Just go see the movie!|`|2ZOOcAr5aa	Yes!!! I LOVE HIM ALL MY LIFE!!    we all should be like this, its ok!? Nothing is wrong with us, and we just love him and always will.|`|6XGYzWYbaa	im exactly like u|`|ASwTNY89aa	Edward is ok i guess    i think it is unhealthy for girls to obsess over this book because if they belive there is an "Edward Cullen"  out there for them then they are crazy. They will fall for the first guy who acts romantic and then do what bella does. married. knocked up. that stuff doesnt end happily    i didnt cry but i did bite the book lol|`|Yw1zIYK6aa	I hate when people are OBSESSED with the series. I like it, but its not my life! Its okay, I cry sometimes too when I realize that I will probably never love someone like Bella loves Edward, but almost no one gets a love that strong.  Dr. Dog|`|XXc15qzzaa	I cried too in the second book.  But no, it's not healthy to want something that isn't part of reality. Edward's character is every girl's dream (except his control-y-ness) and no one could live up to your standards if that's what you're looking for.    Marriage is hard and most of the time it's not fun. even the best marriages. But they're worth it when it's your partner and friend who helps you become your best self. It's hard work, and those words don't express the difficulty of living with another person. But love is not at first sight and no guy would wait over 100 years to have sex! He would have found someone by then.   When women realize that men don't think like women, we'll all be better off. And the opposite too!|`|AA10750666	Many twilight fans hated the movie.  I thought it was hilarious because it so poorly made and the acting was horrible.  I do not think it is healthy to  be obsessed with Edward because although he is protective of her, he overdoes it.  Watching her sleep, following her, etc is overprotective and not healthy.  Would you really want someone watching your every move?  Sure, Edward sounds romantic and doesn't mean any harm to her, he is in Essence, a stalker.  I only say this because, anyone in reality that happens to behave like Edward, is put in jail.  I just don't want to see any girls getting hurt due to thinking his behavior is sweet cuz its not.|`|5jOeBNxQaa	Just to answer your questions:  1) I think the characters, overall, pretty much suck(in a bad way). Bella started off this great, strong, independant, SMART character and ended up being whiny, dependant on everyone else, always the damsel in distress, obsessed with her boyfriend, etc. Also Mr. Perfect, Sparkly Vampire guy over there sucks too. He's a STALKER, possessive, controlling... shiny paper on an empty box, etc. And at this point I don't even know why they love each other. I haven't read Twilight in a while but the "I love yous", and Bella's thoughts of it, just came out of nowhere as I recall.  2) NO. I mean this isn't even a little obsessed, this is overboard. There is more to life than having a hot, perfect boyfriend. Furthermore for all that Edward is amazing, is he or anyone else worth giving up your life(literally and figuratively) for. Plus I think some have it in their heads that an Edward is gonna come along. People have flaws... they aren't perfect and they sure as heck aren't Edward Cullen. But you know what, in general, I perfer them to Edward.  3) I totally cry... it is funny though that even in my Twilight obsessed days I never cried.    JMO. There are aspects of Edward that I do find admirable... and I do see the love there. Overall though, no. He snuck into her room... OILED her window so she wouldn't hear him. Bella's life becomes totally about HIM and HIM alone... do we even see her friends in the end? Again though its just my opinion.|`|IW5Gc8eSaa	im a fan but im not a super obsessed fan.  actually the movie did very well. and it was a really good movie.  i think that its harmless for teenagers to be a little obsessed with a book or a character. as long as they grow out of it eventually. (i no when i first read the series i had my moments of fan obsessiveness)   and who doesnt want someone that loves them as much as edward loves bella?|`|w2IzpkNlaa	I can tell you one thing if you love Twilight ITS SO TOTALY NORMAL!|`|iVBn7t46aa	im a bit older than a teenager (twenties) and honestly I love twilight. I've read it way too many times to admit and I feel attached to the characters. My coworkers and husband things its dumb haha..|`|4RrzVNHRaa	I, too, love these books. I'm also not one of those "Fanpires". They aggravate me. I absolutly love Emmett. He just cracks me up in the last book with his jokes to Bella and Edward about their relationships. I love the rest of the Cullens. The only charecters that make me angry are Mike, Jessica, and Jacob. And no, it's not healthy for teens to be that obsessed. ITS A BOOK NOT REAL LIFE!!! But yes, I do cry...sometimes.|`|ChzTZ1Wdaa	i agree....i love the characters too but im not totally obsessed. i kinda think it's sad though, how much girls are obsessed but whatever. ha! i cried alittle also, only in the second one though, where edward leaves bella.      anyway, the movie wasn't the best but i think you should still watch it cause you could compare how you imagined everything from when you were reading the books in detail, to the way hollywood portrays the book.|`|omdiLD27aa	i think it is not unhealthy to obsess over....  i think girls know that there really isn't an Edward Cullen, they are not that dumb, hahha|`|NBf5q2f5aa	omg omg i cried like 4 20 minutes after edward leaves in new moon....i t was so saddd he was just like goodbye bella omg omg =[[ and i kept flipping ahead unti i saw edward name...another part i cried about was just the end of the saga and hoe ill never knoe hoe there life is now lol ehhehe i lovee the saga like u and i cant wait for nov. 21 when new moon comes out! can u believe stephenie might not do midnight sun!?!? it totally sucks the book was leaked...i loved eclipse the best/......the connection between them (jacob and bella) even thought i a hugee edward fan i loved the camping secene when jacob layed on bellaaa awwwwwwwwwww and he goes ur lips r still blue want me to warm those up for you and edward go tmad ahaha sooooo funny .. i hate jane thoughhhh =[ butttt happy reading!|`|xzZYf2X5aa	im a big fan of twilight series but im not Cullen-Crazy|`|xihWos2maa	I thought that the books were okay. I don't think that their relationship was really healthy. I couldn't stop thinking of him as a stalker while I was reading it and no, I did not cry while reading them. I did cry when Sirius Black, in Harry Potter, died though, so your not a dork.(=|`|BpcAVgEeaa	"Yes, hes possessive and controlling but he has a undeniable love for Bella which I do crave."    This is really, truly sad. Love is not being controlling and possessive. Edward Cullen does not love Bella anymore than I love a piece of candy. That's all she is to him. Something delicious that smells good, but nothing more. Their relationship is based on lust and physical attraction. Please do not be mislead by this crappy book. Love is beautiful and you are not going to find out what it is by reading Twilight, I can guarantee you that.

It is not boring at all, and kept me picking up the book whenever possible... which has gotten hard for me so this was quite refreshing. However, it isnt the usual teen romance. This is more of a human/werewolf thing. If you are willing to try something new though you will not be sorry. I havent found a book better than this one. The scenes do get pretty steamy though, so if you want something a little more conservative then this may not be for you. A little confusing at times, but as you read on you understand and it all falls into place. An amazing read! Even if you don't pick it up as a first choice, flip through it sometime. After all you can always take it back to the library and there is no damage done. If you do like it then you can buy it and have it to re-read. I'm getting ready to buy it right now. No joke. I love amazon ^.^

Really, we are dead for ever, but at the max live 130 years.  So, 99.99999999999999999% of the time we are dead.  Who the hell cares when it will end? God, likes it a big deal or something.  Like the Rhianna says "live your life"|`|kukhR1Gqaa	No, it will not.  The basis for this prediction is the Aztec calendar that ends on Dec. 12, 2012.  However, the peoples of Central America had the view that time ran in cycles, and 2012 is just the end of one cycle and the beginning of another.  So, if you believe in that kind of stuff, something big will happen, but it will not be the Second Coming or anything like that.    In Revelations it says the tribulation will come like a thief in the night, meaning no one will know it will happen, which is hardly the case with 2012 when tons of people believe the world will end.  Further, many people were certain computers would stop working when the new millenium started.  People always have had theories of when the world was going to end, and everyone to-date has been wrong.    "So this is how the world ends, not with a bang but with whimper."|`|Tjr9aObNaa	No, live life..don't be afraid of it!|`|qDYzdz5daa	It's garbage.    Everything you have heard about 2012 is full of half-truths and outright lies, with the following exceptions.    1. There will be an American presidential election in 2012.  2. The Summer Olympics will be in London in 2012.  3. The Planet Venus will transit the Sun in 2012. (The only effect of this will be that a small dot will be visible on the sun in telescopes that are adapted to look at the sun.)  4. There will be natural disasters, war, famine, plague, etc... but no more than in any other year.    That is all. Everything else is bull.    Nostradamus didn't predict anything for 2012.    Some people think the Mayans did, but they are wrong. The Mayan Calendar is just a very long calendar. It does NOT predict the end of the world. It just so happens that the Mayan version of "December 31, 1999" falls on what we would call "December 21, 2012." The Mayan calendar contains events that happen AFTER 2012, even after 4000 AD, so clearly the world will not "end" at this point.    (You'll remember that a lot of fools also thought the world was going to end in 12-31-1999, but it didn't. Same deal.)    The hoaxters mainly choose 12212012 because of numerology (which is also garbage) and the repeating and reversal of "12", and also because December 21 being the winter solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern hemisphere, it was considered the "End" of the year by MANY ancient civilizations. And that's ALL. They just had different ways of counting the years.    All the other predictions, "pole shifts" (which take thousands of years to even start) "galactic alignments" (a lie, we're far above the galactic plane and moving away from it, "killer planet Nibiru' (physically impossible) and everything else, are completely and totally made-up.    There are NO scientists who believe in this 2012 nonsense. If you see somene claiming "scientists" said so, ask for names and degrees, because they either don't exist, or got their "degree" from some mail-in fake "university of pulp paper."    This answer will be thumbs-downed by crazy people who think that YouTube videos are "evidence."|`|8ekoa6szaa	My crystal ball says no.    How do you think anybody can really know?  Remember the Hale Bopp comet a few years back and those nuts out in California killing themselves because they thought a spaceship was coming along behind it?  There was no spaceship or anything else, yet all those people are still dead.  They believed!  Just like people today seem to believe that the world is going to end in 2012.  What horse hockey.  NOBODY knows when the world is going to end unless it's a higher being that you or I and He isn't exactly confiding in me.  How about You?|`|FmbwIbtzaa	Believing in the end time is not new and it has had the same results each time. Insanity: "doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  Albert Einstein   "In the great day of the kingdom judgment, many will say to me, `Did we not prophesy in your name and by your name do many wonderful works?' But I will be compelled to say to them, `I never knew you; depart from me you who are false teachers.' But every one who hears this charge and sincerely executes his commission to represent me before men even as I have represented my Father to you, shall find an abundant entrance into my service and into the kingdom of the heavenly Father."    About 2000 years ago a group of Christians got together to follow the teachings of Jesus and living a communal life of sharing with the intent of being prepared for that day when Jesus would return and begin a new world. Generation sense have developed a similar practice with teaching along with the end times. The Mayans had there own way of dealing with the spiritual Realities and we all know what happened to them. To believe any thing they did seems to me a loosing cause. I prefer to believe the Teachings of Jesus and not the teaching about Jesus.     Most of the so-called Messianic prophecies of the Old Testament were made to apply to Jesus long after his life had been lived on earth. For centuries the Hebrew prophets had proclaimed the coming of a deliverer, and these promises had been construed by successive generations as referring to a new Jewish ruler who would sit upon the throne of David and, by the reputed miraculous methods.    There is a great and glorious purpose in the march of the universes through space. All of your mortal struggling is not in vain. We are all part of an immense plan, a gigantic enterprise, and it is the vastness of the undertaking that renders it impossible to see very much of it at any one time and during any one life. We are all a part of an eternal project which the Gods are supervising and outworking. The whole marvelous and universal mechanism moves on majestically through space to the music of the meter of the infinite thought and the eternal purpose of the First Great Source and Center.              The eternal purpose of the eternal God is a high spiritual ideal. The events of time and the struggles of material existence are but the transient scaffolding which bridges over to the other side, to the promised land of spiritual reality and supernal existence. Of course, we mortals find it difficult to grasp the idea of an eternal purpose; we are virtually unable to comprehend the thought of eternity, something never beginning and never ending. Everything familiar to us has an end.|`|YLcBsYYraa	No, I hope not. That's the year I graduate. But, how many times have apocalypses been predicted? They haven't happened.

I don't really know, but those guys do not exist today, therefore, they had to have stopped making the calendar at some point.  I guess 2012 was the year.  Everything has an explaination.

uJBnZWtcaa	It's best to do this anyway.  Sand it with first some fine sandpaper, then some very fine sandpaper. Wipe the dust off after each sanding.  Finally,  wipe with a slightly damp cloth and let dry.  Reapply the varathane.  I usually apply and sand twice then put on a final coat.  It gives a wonderful, deep finish.    Note: sand lightly.  You should never sand through to the paint or the wood.  Also, apply varathane lightly.  If you need to, apply a second coat.

j5Apt8hWaa	What about this.    Learn how to be a photographer first.  Then you will not only know what you are doing, you will be able to shoot any camera under any circumstances at any time.  While you are going to school, you will learn soon enough which cameras YOU like the best and can start building the system you need.   I am assuming that you are not a photographer at present, because if you were, you would not be asking this question ... You would already know.     While in school, you can join NPPA as a student and start networking with working pros.    There is much, much more to being a photographer than just the "right" camera.    If you can "freeze frame" television shots of the various paparazzi, you will notice that they are using a professional grade DSLR (Nikon D3 or Canon 1Ds, Mark III) and the favorite 70-200 mm f/2.8 lens with either a Nikon SB800/SB900 or Canon Speedlite 580EX II.    That combination of equipment will require about a $5,000 investment if you choose Nikon, $8,200 if Canon.    You will then need a semi-fast, maneuverable car and a good notebook computer you can use to FTP your "breaking news" image files to your agent, rep or preestablished contact at a news agency    Oh, and you will need some kind of network of informants so you know when and where "hot" properties are going to be so you can get there first and start shooting when they show up.    There is much more to becoming a paparazzo than just a camera and lens.|`|k8AcVixTaa	If you really want the kind of lifestyle and job that invades the privacy of others then any digital camera with really good lenses will work.

d27afec566c52580743f911dea755f8eaa	Unfortunately no one knows exactly where it originated from.  There are many theories but no definitive proof.  Many believe the dance to have originated in early Goddess worship rituals.  The place of origin has however remained controversial.  Some say it originated in ancient Egypt, others credit ancient Greece, Turkey, and India.  The ancient Indian Culture referred to as either Harrapan Civilization or Indus Valley Civilization is still a mystery.  The language has not been cracked and very little is known about their culture and practices.  The type of dancing they did in Ancient India is unknown although figurines from Mohejodaro of dancing girls have been found they tell little of the actual dances.  Many believe that the dance evolved in Temples worshiping the Goddess and that the dancers actual served as sacred prostitutes.  There are however also many ancient accounts of dancing being linked to childbirth and death rituals (and subsequently rebirth).  Additionally the use of bellydance as a childbirth ritual is still practiced in rural areas throughout the middle east.  It is also practiced as a fertility blessing at weddings as well as a sort of sexual education for brides-to-be.  These modern uses however can be used to hint at it's origins and usages throughout time.  Those who believe it to have originated in India credit the development not specifically as coming from Indian dance or Indian culture but rather as a catalyst of sorts for change and spread of dance throughout the Middle East and Europe which occurred.  This is also accredited to the Romani or Roma (commonly called Gypsies although this term is no longer PC).  They did travel throughout the Middle East and Europe and did have certain influence on places where they settle.  Although many Romani dances exist today there are many differences.  The Ghawazee of Egypt are said to be the most authentic bellydance by professional Egyptian dancers and they are descendants of the Nawar tribe of Romani Origin.  There are also the Turkish Romani tirbes who have a distinct type of dancing which also is considered a folkloric/ethnic style of bellydance (which has become an umbrella term).  However, many other Romani tribes throughout Europe and other parts of the world do not practice dances which are easily linked to bellydance.  What is obvious is that many of the Romani who have settled in certain regions have both taken on a lot of "local flavor" as well as influenced local dance and music.  Now that I've probably completely confused you I'll leave you with a short list of sources that you may find useful in further researching this subject on your own to draw your own conclusions.|`|lD9FP9bSaa	There are indications that belly dance was common in pre-Aryan India and ancient Egypt.

In photography, a lens assembly that includes an aspheric element is often called an aspherical lens.    The asphere's more complex surface profile can eliminate spherical aberration and reduce other optical aberrations compared to a simple lens. A single aspheric lens can often replace a much more complex multi-lens system. The resulting device is smaller and lighter, and possibly cheaper than the multi-lens design. Aspheric elements are used in the design of multi-element wide-angle and fast normal lenses to reduce aberrations.    Aspheric lenses are also sometimes used for eyeglasses. These are typically designed to give a thinner lens, and also distort the viewer's eyes less as seen by other people, producing better aesthetic appearance. Aspheric eyeglass lenses typically do not provide better vision than standard "best form" lenses, but rather allow a thinner, flatter lens to be made without compromising the optical performance.    I carefully examined the technicals specs of all of the Sigma lenses in the 24-70mm range (there are 4 of them). The first lens you had on your list which sell for about $899 is probably the best one. The filter size is 82mm, which allows gretaer amount of light into the lens. Sigma also makes one in that range which has macro on it for about $670. The filter size for that lens is also 82mm...so it's a trade off. If you enjoy taking macro or close up photos then I would probably suggest the cheaper one with macro.    Are you "unhappy" with the Nikon 24-70mm, f/2.8 lens for that camera...or just "unhappy" with the $1,500. price tag?    Good Luck with your choices.|`|AZgIkmfxaa	Typically the more expensive lens uses better quality glass and the workmanship is more precise; thus, you will take clearer, sharper images. This lens will also be "faster" which means it responds to light quicker.    Unless you are a professional photographer or a serious amateur, the cheaper lens will suit your needs.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	The first lens is an upgrade to the Older version. It incorporates Sigma's HMS ( hypersonic Motor ), which allows for fast, silent auto focus. I am not sure about improvements optically, however. The newer version is smaller, and it takes a smaller filter, these are all little things. Do some research. I was reading some reviews on the old version of the 24-70mm f/2.8 lens, and the reviews were really bad. The softness of the lens wide open is unbelievable and lens flare is a major problem.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	If you want the best in image quality, go for Nikon's own 24-70mm f/2.8. They're really expensive, but is well worth the money and even beats Canon's own equivalent. The first lens you listed differs from the second one in that it has a better autofocus system. Its "hsm" mechanism focuses a lot faster and more quieter than the one without hsm. Optically, I would suspect the more expensive lens to perform noticeably better when it is wide open. Distortion, ca, should also be more controlled. To the usual photographer, these make very little difference. The hsm autofocusing can be really useful, but I can easily live without it if your not taking a lot of sport pictures (which you prob wont do with a 24-70) anyways.

9XJLlPaEaa	They weren't, that's why it fell.    Or do you mean from the Republic to the Empire?    EDIT: Well there was Civil War for a while there. Those that supported Caesars' assassins vs/ Octavian Augustus and Marc Anthony, who eventually went to war with one another when they beat the dissidents.   Back then the military was loyal to their general not to the leader of the people. The armies were closer to private armies.   Augustus, in Caesar's will was designated as his heir, which was taken to mean as political, financial, and military heir. Those soldiers that were loyal to Caesar, many became loyal to his grand-nephew and adopted son, Augustus.   Many were also loyal to Anthony, so Augustus banded with Anthony at the beginning. They won against the Republics last remnants and eventually went against each other. Augustus was the victor and became the emperor of the Roman Empire. Augustus, while not the most robust of men, was a brilliant strategist and political mind. He consolidated his power by either killing or paying off his enemies, the latter of which worked much better.

19a6bfdb0fbe9d31ebb8c9044a8ced20aa	To highlight the fast pace and ever-changing setting of an urban landscape, you can film one scene (let's say a busy street) for an extended period of time, and then alter it so it the film reels in fast-forward. It would be interesting to choose the music for this, too. If you want the viewer to slow down and notice the details of an urban landscape, you can paint/draw/photograph a small segment of the landscape. Wherever you see beauty, capture it in your art--especially in places where one would overlook. Look up Marlene Steele, perhaps she will inspire you. :)
Sb1weuy2aa	It was the same with me when I first started. I was clueless. Honestly, electric is way...... easier then acoustic that is why in hard rock bands you'll most likely hear only 3-4 popular acoustic songs, like godsmack only has a few acoustic songs and avenged sevenfold my favorite band, has no acoustic song and if they do they are not popular. We all like different music, but always start with your basic in-expensive acoustic. There are 6 strings. In a TAB, each number is what you play on that string. For example,    E-----0--------------------------  B--------0-----------------------  G-------------------------------  D-------------------------------  A-------------------------------  E--------------------------------    0 is open string you just play it without any frets. Frets are the little bars on the long part of the guitar, the neck. The end of the guitar is where you twist those and it tunes it. Loosen it for a deeper sound, Tighten for a higher sound. Here is a website that can teach you tune it, This particularly is the standard tuning. http://www.guitarforbeginners.com/online...    http://www.tunemybass.com/    play with that website also. To use an online tuner, twist and compare the sounds online and on your guitar. Back to playing. The other numbers like this,    E-------------------------------  B-------------------------------  G-------------------------------  D-------------------------------  A--2--2--2--4--2--0---------  E-------------------------------    mean that you have to count starting from the neck, down and right to the left of the fret place your finger, push hard, and play the note. Chords are lined in a row like this,    e--0----------------------------  B--1----------------------------  G--0----------------------------  D--2----------------------------  A--3----------------------------  E-------------------------------    you would play those top to bottom. having the guitar in your lap the thickest string is on top. On a TAB , the bottom string is the top string in your lap, otherwise, the thickest or deepest sounding string. If you do not understand the way I'm explaining it, the here is a website that teaches all: http://www.howtotuneaguitar.org/lessons/...    FYI: I know all this and I'm 11 =) don't worry i'm not telling you wrong i can play some songs like - godsmack and  metallica and more! sorry I'M a show off!|`|6RRrEsZjaa	Look it up on google or by a guitar learning book.|`|QsQj8jO7aa	learn to read real notation.|`|6sAOBn4maa	the lines are the strings (last line is low E, next is A, next up is D, next up is G, next up is B, and the top one is the high E), and the numbers are the frets    that song is super easy to play. I can play it. Learned it in a half hour. Enjoy playing.|`|pW55qClKaa	It tells you which fret to play on which string.  The strings from fattest to shortest are: EADGBe  For example:  E-------------  A-2---2-------  D---4----0-----  G-------------  B-------------  e-------------    This tab tells you to start by playing the 2nd fret on the 5th string, then play the 4th fret on the 4th string, the 2nd fret on the 5th string, and then just play the fourth string without any fretting (open string)|`|DhM8u7Xuaa	It's quite easy actually.  The six lines are each of the strings.  The top is your first string, the second is your second string..etc.  The number on the line is what fret to play.  If there is a p it means pull off.  If there is an h, it means hammer on.  Good luck.  :)|`|sm0COFLTaa	The dashed lines represent the strings of the guitar. The top line is your high E string, the bottom line your low E.  The numbers represent which fret you should hold down the string at.  So this - E---------1------2------3--------4------ means you pluck the E string at frets 1,2,3 and 4.  If some of the numbers are on top of each other like this -  ----1----  ----1----  ----1---- this means you play those three strings fretted at the first fret at the same time.  A zero on a line represent the open string.  There are lots of symbols that can be used in tablature to show things like slides, hammer ons and pull offs, muting strings and so on but there should be a key explaining this if needed.   Hope that helps!|`|Sn8whmsSaa	I love tab, each string is pretty self explanatory the numbers represent the fret you depress, so in the beginning your only using two strings D and B.  The D string is 0 or open (your not depressing any fret) the B string is 3 and depressed on the 3rd fret.  The opening of this song is a fast alternation between the D and B strings the you switch to the D string 4th fret and the back again all the while continuing to depress the 3rd fret on the B string and so on and so forth....  The Strings which do not have any numbers on them are not strummed.

If you're keen, pay for a membership at QuietOnSet.com.au or Artshub.com.au; they list heaps of auditions every day around Australia. Another good site is screenhub.com.au.    My best advice is to visit the first link, head to the FAQ section, and read about finding agents in Australia, how to find work, etc. It also has a lot of stuff about dodgy Aussie agents to avoid. There's heaps of free info there for new actors, and is practically the best place you can find info for emerging actors. There's also a huge list of companies that you can search by suburb. AGENTS DO NOT COST MONEY - IF THEY ASK FOR FEES UPFRONT, THEY ARE DODGY.    Visit www.alliance.org.au, the actor's union for Australia and join.    If you don't have experience don't expect a professional role or an agent. I suggest you use the next years to build up experience, and then try applying for a local uni course. Trust me, there are too many actors out there and not enough roles. Everyone wants to be in Home and Away and Neighbours; very few actually do it.    Those Aussie actors who are in Hollywood have spent the better part of 20 years developing their career - first in Australia, and then overseas. Do yourself a favour; take some classes and do some shows first.    Think about attending WAAPA, NIDA or VCA or one of the many great courses out there (there are heaps) when you're ready.    There's a lot of indie films being made in Australia, for which you can audition for without an agent; check the first link for examples, or Quiet On Set.    DON'T sign up for one of those American talent sites. They are scams and never have anything for Australian auditions.|`|vLF2uz9saa	time!! you need way more expience i now a billion could be two in your case|`|Ahud6tPZaa	At your age, I doubt your claim to "billions" of plays.    At your age, an agent is very unlikely to hire you, not just because of your lack of proper experience. You'd have to take a parent along to every audition, recall, etc., because you're too young to sign contracts.    Concentrate on building proper experience, it'll take a while. Remember, acting is far more than saying lines. If I mentioned "The 5 W's" would you know what I'm talking about? Basic actor training, and crucial for doing well in an audition...

Napoleon wasn't handicapped.|`|OocDN5evaa	No, Napoleon Bonaparte was 5' 6''. Short, yes, but not a midget!

tWg0MuInaa	Most right-handed writers use an oblique-penholder but left-handed writers can work with a straight pen holder. There are no 'left handed' nibs or holders for writing script.  Those nibs that come in sizes are broad-edge nibs and are used differently.  Script (Spencerian especially) uses pressure-release to generate the thick-thin lines.  The broad-edge nibs (for foundational, italic, bookhand for example) uses the edge of the pen and angle to the paper to create the thick-thin lines---not pressure.  Chancery Cursive is a form of Italic where letters are connected---hence, "Cursive".      See IAMPETH link below---there are lessons and videos showing the pen in action.  Beyond Words site/video shows a left-handed scribe in action.

nMuDw3Nzaa	Plenty of people use poems as prolouges. as a writer, i much appreciate a good booka and i hope yours turns out okay and i hope you go far with it.  i like that.   seems really deep. what will your story actually be about?|`|AA12160009	No offense but that kind of sounded like a poem rather than a prologue. I suggest maybe describing what a broken soul is before just saying everyone has one and maybe make it a little creepy. Something that you want to look forward to reading. Like I said, it's not that its bad its just that it could be a summary or synopsis of the book instead of the prologue. Just make it something that you like.    Hope I could help!|`|XXc15qzzaa	What you need to do is write an outline. Even if you don't know exactly where you're going. Then write only what moves the plot or the character development forward.  This is one of the most difficult things to do as an author but crucial really.  It sounds intriguing though and I would love to know the plot line.    EDIT:  I would also like to add that beyond the fact that it sounds interesting, more importantly your brief prologue includes profound truths.

I like your prologue and it's a good start, but it's keeping me a little distant from the story. I love it!    The site below helped me a bit.|`|zRIDQraFaa	That intro makes a really great poem. I really like it, probably because I can relate to everything you wrote down.    Before you start it, you really need an idea of a plot then that will probably help.     One thing for sure, My soul is still broken but just by reading this helped patch it up a little and gave a boost.

Bd5My74Aaa	A good portfolio should contain from 12 to 20 works of art. If a student has taken a number of art courses, a variety of media should be represented. Copies of published work are unacceptable. An interpretation of a masterwork could be considered, but paintings and drawings copied from magazines or photographs taken by anyone but the artist are just not done. Originality and creativity cannot be stressed enough. Size of the work is not important, though variety in media is desired. Consider including something less than perfect if the student has stretched and shown imagination. The following are the three important skills to include in a portfolio:       1. Drawing: a portfolio should have good examples of drawing in a variety of media such as pastels, colored pencil, magic marker, ink, charcoal, and conte crayon. A sketchbook could be included. The best drawings are familiar objects, people, nature, and architecture.     2. Painting: acrylic, oils, pastels, watercolor paintings. Drawings made with colored media could take the place of painting in the portfolio.     3. Design: include a poster, publicity flyer, photographs, or layout to show ability to combine a variety of elements.  Include pieces that show you have a grasp on color theory, proportion, linear and atmospheric perspective.  Include pieces that presented a challenge to you. Here are some examples(none of these are required, they are just to explain the concept):          An overhead view of an open container holding an object of personal importance.        An image that conveys a "caged in" feeling.        An album cover depicting someone's life.        Two unrelated objects juxtaposed in a way that suggests a possible relationship.        Two circles, one inside the other. Fill the larger circle with designs that represent classical music and the smaller circle with designs that represent jazz or rock music.        A distorted landscape that expresses a human emotion such as anger, sorrow, jealousy or happiness.        An object with interesting reflections in it, i.e. chrome hub cap, metallic box, glass bottle.        A book cover.        An action figure positioned or distorted to fit the shape of a letterform.    Hope this helps|`|2PDBxlYDaa	Do everything from beautiful people to ugly ones.|`|Z8oGqAmfaa	http://img.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2007/02...    Do itt :)|`|n8uHu9EMaa	Variation, variation, variation. Try different techniques as well and different media. Look at things like hands, feet, faces and animal form, then look at architecture and man made objects. Explore how different techniques can strengthen your message and inforce the image. Make the portfolio interesting and engaging, maybe even bind it creatively. There are no rules when it comes to a folio, as long as it shows your diversity. When I employ people, I look for flair, and the ability to try unusual and different things. Hope this helps.|`|Nby3Emktaa	You could draw yourself, your pets, a landscape, family members, friends, still-lifes, appliances, roads, back-alleys, etc...

jipUipvbaa	2. First, the US bought Louisiana from the French. Originally, they only wanted New Orleans but the French offered the whole thing for $15 million dollars and that was an offer that they couldn't refuse. Although many people disagreed with Monroe's decision to buy Louisiana, it doubled the size of the US. Their second acquisition was Florida. Because of the Seminoles constantly invading Georgia, the Georgians wanted Monroe to control this. Monroe sent Andrew Jackson to get the Seminoles out of Georgia but he attacked Florida with 1700 soldiers. Spain got mad at Jackson but Adams said that there is no reason to get mad at Jackson, Spain should "Govern or Get out". Spain did exactly that and for $5 million dollars, the US bought Florida from Spain. America then conquered Texas by having settlers move there and then later going to war and being victorious. A couple days later, Congress annexed Texas as the 28th state. Next, the US took Oregon . 4 countries claimed it but when Russia and Spain fled the area, only the US and Britain had control of the area. Polk wanted to conquer all of Oregon but when the British said that they would make a treaty where the US got the lower half of Oregon and the British got the upper half, it was an offer he couldn't refuse (this was mainly because the treaty allowed for no bloodshed). America bought California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, part of Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming for $15 million and promised to take care of the Mexicans that already settled there (this promise wasn't kept). The treaty was ratified and the states mentioned above became part of the US. The last part of the acquisitions was the Gadsden Purchase. For $10 million dollars, James Gadsden purchased the Mexican Cession.
jipUipvbaa	1. Manifest Destiny is the belief that it was Americas right and duty to spread across the North American continent. It was so important to the westward spread of the US because people thought it was their God-given right to expand westward and take over land. Manifest Destiny took many forms. America grew through treaties, through settlement, and through war.

The definition, "a series of events that led to the current state-of-affairs" basically suggests your statement. My definition has no word, operand, with such a definition, because my word is metaphysical and "post hoc" thinking, as is your statement. The English language contains very few metaphysical words, especially words based on fallacious perceptions. Philosophically your statement and my definition mean nothing.     Yet, human perception understands reality as a series of events, or as day-to-day operations, causing changes in our physical universe (as well as, our understanding thereof). If it were not the case, fiction and storytelling would be meaningless--as would experience, instruction, sciences, and any other mode of operation.

O15my3olaa	I think there are millions of colours, sounds and notes that can be produced, now that our technology is so advanced. But would the average human be able to see, hear or produce most of  these in visual arts and music? Shapes are infinite too -- from square, pentagon, hexagon and onwards to a million, billion of minute sides and shapes, which finally seem to look like a circle.  It would be extremely difficult  for us to make use of such knowledge or data. Unless we are professionals, delving too deep into almost 'infinite' worlds may well be very stressful, time-consuming, and aimless. I would balance my time and effort into the other infinite and macro worlds of outer space, black holes and distant galaxies, too.    Just an idea. Good question!  :-))|`|LGYaBFE4aa	i do believe so, in retrospect color are but combination of existing matter so while there are millions of colors already pronounced i still believe its possible to conceive more by adjusting the formula to something more precise. but then think, once this color, or shape has been conceived, how would one go about naming it and assuring to themselves that the name fits the product.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	Of course.

The beginning is a little difficult, but they are worth your time once you get going.     I've heard that the Aragon series is really good, however I have not read it myself. Many of my friends have read it, and they tell me that if you enjoyed Harry Potter, you'll like Aragon.    Anything by Madeleine L'Engle is fantastic, especially her books about the Murray family (Wrinkle in Time, A Wind in the Door, A Swiftly Tilting Planet, Many Waters, and An Acceptable Time).

The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins and Maxiamum Ride by James Patterson.    Out of the two, I would read the Maximum Ride series because it's easy to read and a great book. I read it before I read Twilight, and I find I like it better. It's about six kids who can fly.    The Hunger Games is pretty good too, but since it's pretty new there probably isn't much talk about it. It's about a post-war society that must give up two teenagers to fight in a 'game' to entertain the people who won the war. The game is more of a kill or be killed kind of thing, but it's still a good book.
uJBnZWtcaa	I did.  It was on my old XP puter that went belly up. Then I installed it on my new Vista machine.    What's weird about computer software is that we don't buy it.  We buy the license to use it.  That's why there's always that license agreement to agree to that nobody ever reads. If you read it, it usually tells where and how many times you can install the program.  I usually install at work and at home.  Some people install at work, on a laptop and on a desktop at home. Just don't install it on every computer on your block;-)

You should edit that in, then I'll give you some tips.|`|FViagGVEaa	Get a teacher man.  Learning songs by yourself is easy.  Learning theory by yourself is very very hard.|`|QsQj8jO7aa	1st: nobody will ever truly master an instrument. You can get ridiculously good but never master it because there will always be more that can be done with it. Look at music history and how music for individual instruments has evolved over the years as creativity increases, technology etc...    2: learn to read real musical notation and learn the entire fretboard so that  you can look at any fret and instantly know what note it is.    3: learn music theory and harmony so that you will truly understand what it going on in music. You'll be surprised at how much is the same, harmonically speaking, among the different styles of music and how you can just change stuff.    4: do tons of ear training.   These things are your foundation and the rest is just practicing and learning to apply all this to a real life situation.
65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	You betcha. In sunlight you could see fading in as little as 4 months with many color papers. If your photographs were printed at home with dye inks figure fading in as little as a month in sunlight.(Pigment prints will last longer but in sunlight they too will eventually fade.)    I would make duplicate photos from the negatives/original files and keep them stored away. The photographs that you do show should be displayed with acid-free mattes and under UV protection glass. There is no reason that you can't enjoy your photographs. They were made to be seen!    ***    FYI, The only photographs that do not fade are ones that use Palladium or Platinum to make the image. All others, including silver based ones, will eventually fade. If you ever decide to get serious about lightfastness and colorfastness in your color photography I recommend Ultrachrome Inks http://www.epson.com/cgi-bin/Store/Landi... or the Cibachrome Process. http://cibachrome.com/ They will take a very long time to fade.|`|2TLXfQKDaa	UVa light from the sun fades out your run of the mill inks and pictures.

Yes, if you left your photos sitting on a picnic table in the sun for awhile they would become damaged. Photos begin to fade in general after time. A long time, but it happens. Hanging them on your wall will be fine, they won't be in direct sunlight all the time, and not long enough to do serious damage. I'm assuming you keep your window closed during part of the day right? Plus it is probably closed at night. That only leaves a small part of the day there will be actual sunlight.

Maybe they are too mainstream for you. With Crichton, you might need to look at some of his older novels - from reviews, looks like the later ones aren't as good. (I'm thinking The Andromeda Strain and The Terminal Man - I know there are others, but can't come up with the titles.)    Clancy is probably more technical in his books than the science you mention you'd like as part of the plot.

Money can not buy it  Strength can not defeat it  Death can not separate us from it      Love is the key to all that we are.  Without love, I am nothing.    (I am not a poet.  Just a mom/grandma who shares what is in my heart with those who will look.)|`|n9hRyHpqaa	I'd say usually.

Q7vMH7akaa	According to Juilliard's website, if you live on campus in a room, it is $43,000 for a nine-month academic year. If the school is a traditional four-year, then you guys have enough money, since it equals out to $172,000, so you have $28,000 to spare. Great job saving! But, wow, if $200,000 can't get you through college... dang...|`|L76NCybXaa	The last time you asked about Juilliard just days ago, you asked "what is Modern Dance." I don't mean to be flippant, but how do you expect to get into Juilliard if you don't know what modern dance is let alone knowing how to dance it.      Check the answer I gave then under "Robbie"|`|QzB0Osa2aa	you dont know what modern dance is???    im afraid that Julliard is only for the top of the tops, the exceptionally gifted the truly awesome...be sure to be one of them    and yes, as someone said, 200,000 is enough for 4 years|`|0cf4Qja5aa	Are you bragging or complaining? Your off to become a professional student for the next 10 years learning to play an instrument that people in some parts of the world are seemingly gifted, and can play music without every having taken a lesson in their life.    With apartments costing approximately $2500.00 per month, tuition, and food and clothing $200,000 should get you a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Four years NYC NY. Hopefully you'll have some talent and can successfully apply for a scholarship so you can carry on and get on scholarship to receive a PHD.    Good luck you have a very long road ahead!|`|rrqPjliDaa	No, but there are scholarships.|`|kjBzv4ucaa	Go to collegeboard.com  It has everything there.
gAGMLfnmaa	the new deal only perpetuated the economic turn that started with hoover. the new deal was a colossal failure. fdr gets all this credit for nothing!!  the reason we entered the was simple, Dec. 7, 1941.  there were other reasons but the bottom line is that pearl harbor was the catalyst.  by creating jobs in manufacting and government spending people now had money to spend.  the costs were somewhat mitigated because we won the war and there was a financial windfall for the US.  barry o thinks that this approach will work now with HIS bailout. it wont and just like fdr he'll get credit for something he didn't do|`|D4GHgDl4aa	They say it because that's the way it was. FDR's purpose for getting us into the war had nothing to do with the depression and the failure of his policies in creating economic growth. It came from the practical analysis of what would happen if the Axis powers were allowed to take over Europe and the Pacific . We would then stand alone and almost certainly be defeated.
AA11323310	Do you mean London the capital of Gt Britain or someone called London? Your question is not very clear.
exxHakadaa	You are talking about the neck. What you need to do is take the screw out of it completely. Then try to twist and pull at the same time. When you grab the horn to pull don't grab any of the keys and mess them up. Try this a few times and it doesn't work then you need to take it into a music store and have them fix it.|`|nSXos2tIaa	First, I would recommend to get a professional person, such as a clarinet teacher or a band/orchestra director. Ask them if its ok, and if it's not, then take it to a shop.
ULHfJVcJaa	if you want to laugh or giggle you have to like force a laugh or giggle or think of something funny like very funny|`|vLF2uz9saa	Make really bubbly facial expressions like when she says " Maybe ill put on this hat..." And grab the "audience" with your eyes and the way you pronunciate your words.|`|Ahud6tPZaa	Firstly, read the rest of the play this piece comes from. A monologue is useless on it's own. You cannot even begin to understand your character properly until you read the play.    Secondly, forget about props. If it's a monologue, why worry about props? Sure, if you're in a full production of this play, then worry about props.  But if you are going to use props, use them sparingly, and remember that each prop has to have a purpose for being there.    Facial expressions, some of them will come naturally, and only if you know the piece. But as a drama teacher (professionally qualified, I may add) once told me "leave out what wouldn't work on radio".    And don't laugh and giggle for the sake of it....Less is often more.|`|3eCA2GLPaa	Pretend your a child in your room. Have some hats and scarfs to play with. Create your movement in the room for a minute before you speak.  Use the props with each section of the speech.|`|k4arzkataa	First step: Identify the character. Who is she, how old is she, where is she, what is her short term motivation, what is her long term motivation, where was she before this, where is she going? It might be helpful to write a mini-biography in the voice of your character.  Once you've developed a character, the next part should just follow. The best piece of advice ive ever received from a director is "don't act, just be." Know your subtext and what the character feels. Whatever you do, don't pick places to have certain facial expressions. Good acting is not about putting on a facial expression, you have to assume the persona of your character and actually feel what you are saying. When you are really feeling something, you will naturally assume an appropriate facial expression. Compare your own experiences to that of the character, and think about how you felt.   Another tip: don't use props. In a short monologue like this, it will be distracting. The whole point is pretending, so just pretend! Imagine you're really seeing the things described.    This is a really cute, energetic monologue so you should have a lot of fun with the blocking and movement and character development. =]  Good luck!

khb0MTNqaa	A previous poster was right- it hinders the buzzing. Also, though, it tends to mean you're not exactly using the right muscles. Trumpet players use the buccinator muscle, which stretches up the cheeks, towards the cheekbones. If you're puffing out your cheeks, it's extremely difficult to make the buccinator muscle function properly. Finally, it's rather painful for most people.|`|3FigVwDJaa	i was first chair for my band for three  years in high school, its not good to puff your cheeks because its harder to make your lips vibrate becuase they part when your cheeks expand|`|MgDWlJJcaa	when you puff, your cheeks, your not getting all the air focused in the mouthpiece. therefore, you sometimes wouldn't have the air to make the sound you wanted.

E28mQDX0aa	Yea, actually two people die...    **SPOILERS**    Both Johnny and Dally die at the end.    A burning beam falls on to Johnny's back when he, Ponyboy, and Dally are saving some kids form a burning church and it breaks his back. Dally gets shot by the police (he robs a convenience store and gets chased by the police and they shoot him when he pulls out a gun (that's not even loaded).    I would highly recommend both the book and the movie, they are simply amazing and the movie is truly faithful to the book.|`|lrZSzvxuaa	It's like kids living in a bad neighbor hood and trying to live through all of their problems. The upper class kids are called 'socs' while the "hood guys" are called 'greasers' usually because they put allot of heir grease on.  Johnny and Danny dies.  Johnny dies fron an acident while he was in the hospital  While Danny died by something like cop suicide. Like he made the cops shoot at him, he did it because he really loved Johnny. It is written in the p.o.v. Of Ponyboy.|`|FF9mMlgKaa	I watched the Outsiders but I liked it's off-beat cousin Rumble Fish more just because of the atmosphere and the score and the characters are a little more oddball.

Even though it's now ruined and you know what happens, you should still read the book and watch the movie. The book is better but the movie is good too.

DVuWsb2raa	I believe the real key to happiness is being happy with yourself. If helping others is the only time you are happy, then you are not truly happy.

7e7002b6150c8c3eae2926c9baf2be5daa	I do believe that there is no such thing as 'evil'.    There are actions, and there are reactions (consequences).  It is our perceptions that label things as evil.    Just as perception shows us what we want to see during an illusionists performance, so does our consciousness perceive 'evil'.|`|ylYx43taaa	yes|`|809fb6c211bb2a7784bb577e1e6c272aaa	Apathy rather than evil, I think, is closer to the idea of "the absence of love".

b4XeU5AVaa	Singing is a huge subject. Focus on a particular kind of singing that you like - say, country or jazz. Find some great recordings of masters at work, and listen to how they do it. Depending on what kind of singing you're looking into, the things to work on vary widely. If you plan to be singing opera, learn to darken and brighten your tone, and experiment with vibrato (this is the quivering, pulsing sound you often hear on long notes). For all styles of singing, there are a few key ideas.    1. Diction. This is extremely important if you plan to sing in a group, but also vital for solo singing. Take a word like "world." If you sing "worrrld," you'll sound like a hillbilly. When you encounter words that could sound better, say them differently and more clearly. It's O.K. to over-enunciate a bit.    2. Breathing. You'll hear "phrasing" often. Phrasing is how your form your sentence. For instance, if I talked like *pause* this, it wouldn't make *pause* sense. Make sure you're breathing at the right places so that you don't run out of air but you don't ruin the structure of the lyrics. Conductors and directors will be very critical about breathing during a crescendo (when the music is getting louder), don't make that mistake. There is also a breath mark that looks like an apostrophe that you may see sometimes in music. This does not mean you have the option to breath there if you're low on air- it's not a recommendation. It is important to the structure of the phrasing that you breathe there. On the breathing itself... learning to breathe correctly is one of the hardest parts about vocal technique. Don't hyperventilate- make sure every breath is paced and 'to the point' so you don't end up with no air when you need it. Watch out auditions- it's much harder to breathe correctly at an audition if you're nervous. You'll also hear "breath support" a lot. On hard-to-hit notes, using more air 'supports' the note and prevents it from sounding week. Make sure the air you put into the note is 'backing it up', making it stronger.    3. Musicality. If you're reading notes, pay attention to written details like dynamics and articulations. They make a huge difference. If you're singing by ear (meaning, singing a song the way you hear it), feel free to add your own flair to the song, but make sure you don't take a pop song and sing it like death metal. Or maybe, do! Enjoy the full range of possibilities presented by your voice, that unlike most instruments, doesn't have any tricky buttons or strings.    4. Once you've mastered basic musicality, breathing, and diction, work on your own personal style. Some notable unique styles are Elvis' rockabilly, Steve Perry's soaring tenor, Aretha Franklin's passionate soul singing, and Michael Jackson's vocal percussion.    The voice is the most popular instrument because anyone can play it- including you. Good luck and have fun!       Jonathan |`|pmav9Hehaa	practice practice practice

draNVjbkaa	With regards to training:  I believe that the first three classes that you should take before even engaging in a scene study/acting class are: Cold Reading, Commercials, and Improv.    Why a cold reading class? How do you get the role? By auditioning! Auditioning and acting are two DIFFERENT worlds! In L.A. especially, the majority of your auditions are cold reads. You're lucky if you can get the sides the night before. Cold reading teaches you how to make sense of the script within a short period of time and also with in a limited space (you don't physicalize as much on auditions as you do when actually do the scene). After you get the part, you can always get an acting coach.    Why commercials? Because those are the money jobs. Build your foundation with commercials so you can afford the best training and materials needed for a successful acting career. Commercials also don't require you to bust out your Meisner or Strasberg techniques. The commercial cds and clients just want to see real people.    Improv is a must period. It teaches you how to not be self conscious, us your imagination, and make bold and quick choices. It also goes great with commercial auditions for a lot of them are improv.|`|pIDd2y8Xaa	go to school. for acting. it will help more than you'll know.    make sure you have everything in order so that you can graduate in the shortest amount of time possible, and then from there move to a major city (if you're into theatre, go to NY. film? go to LA) get an agent and a manager. hire a good photographer to take your headshots, and have help making a professional resume. there's a book you need to get. it will tell you everything.|`|7e80152bdb8d8318404698c1b63f95c1aa	start off taking some classes to help you get experienced, and then find an agent and look them up online and make sure there not a scam!! because i got scammed :( then you have to practice a lot and audition for things, starting off small like commercials|`|F2iXhbBtaa	take classes, go to college, get head shots, and start networking! networkign is VERY important!

HUIpctJwaa	As you may know, all colors have three qualities which can be used to describe them: hue (color), intensity (how colorful) and value (lightness and darkness). They get many different names depending on where you learn them, but any form of color analysis will use these three under some name.    Just looking at the results of an inversion on paint leads me to believe that it leaves the saturation alone, but inverts the hue and value of a color.    Value is inverted by switching the values of white and black, or rather by switching the position of the color on the white-black scale but conserving it's contrast between the two. If white is 100% and black is 0% and your color is 80%, your color after the inversion would be 20%. If your color is 50, it would remain 50. If your color was 60, it would become 40, and so on.    Hue is inverted simply with color complements. The full range of hues can be best looked at as a circle. For any given point on the circle, the hue directly across is it's complement, it's opposite. I'd expect the computer to just shift every hue value 180 degrees to get the complement of every color.  You may see that complements are slightly different between RGB and paint mixing. This is because additive mixing uses a different set of primary colors, and the light interacts with the eye slightly differently.|`|AA12339318	Changing it to it's complimentary or "negative" color.    Orange to blue, red to green,purple to yellow, black to white, etc.

jrwaSSYGaa	A. But all of them are good.
AwjmyLJcaa	I would say B.  Even though the Constitution declared that all were equal, it was not necessarily so.  Slavery continued as usual and women basically had no rights at all.  The "free" and "equal" seemed to only apply to white men.  I am not sure if you are supposed to give an example for each you have up there, but that is just one example.  There were many problems with the Constitution.
r9s0VyJgaa	Hey, if that works for you to help you figure out scales and chords, then that's fine.  Its easier to visualize chords or scales on a piano keyboard than on a guitar fretboard, IMO -- and I don't play piano :-)     Then at some point you have to transcribe those scales and chords onto the guitar keyboard, but knowing what notes you're looking for before you pick up the guitar will make that easier.

It was enjoyable to read . Re-look at some of what I mentioned if this is for school .

Most dance teachers like nude colored. For lyrical, I'd get something with a little less coverage than the jazz shoe. I reccomend Pedini's it covers the toes and heel, but leaves the arch exposed which creates really great lines for your foot, especially if you have a nice arch. It's also a really flexible split sole which is also good if you have a high arch like I do.   Regular Pedini: http://www.capeziostore.com/Pedini%26reg...  or   Femme Pedini: http://www.capeziostore.com/Pedini%26reg...  You can find versions of Pedini's from different brands though, probably for less if you like. The Femme is nice because it's more form-fitting to your foot but I like the look of the regular ones more.     I don't like foot undeez either because my toes always get in the way and it makes it hard to turn. These shoes don't cover the heel, but they have more coverage than foot undeez, making turning much easier and I like them for lyrical.   http://www.capeziostore.com/Pirouette-p1...    However, if you are set on something like a jazz shoe, I would try to find something nude colored.|`|OGLulBtwaa	i think these would be perfect in leather or canvas.   http://www.discountdance.com/frame_set.p...  i have them in leather for ballet, i love them

Something life-shattering, heartbreaking.   (Say, for example, that a couple were engaged, and the man joined the military even though his fiancee said she couldn't deal with waiting years for him. She knew it was his dream, so she was willing to let him go because she loved him. The day before he's supposed to leave for training, she finds out she's a few months pregnant.)   The second person comes with a strong suspicion of the news that was delivered. It's something that would hurt them, too, and rock their world, but that they couldn't do anything about - knowing would just mean that it was a bad situation for both of them.   (The man's curious about a little weight she's been putting on, and that she hasn't had a period that he knows of in a while. He can't very well just call and not go to training - it's his dream, and he's agreed - but he would feel obligated to stay if he knew. It would end in an unhappy, resentful life.)   So, the first person talks the second person out of it - they rationalise, explain, lie through their teeth. They don't want it to be true.   (She says she had one, it was just light. She says she's been eating because she's stressed.)  Finally, the second person believes them, and leaves. Once they're gone, reality hits the first person - they lied so well that they almost believed it was true. But it wasn't, and they can't lie to themselves.

jipUipvbaa	2. First, the US bought Louisiana from the French. Originally, they only wanted New Orleans but the French offered the whole thing for $15 million dollars and that was an offer that they couldn't refuse. Although many people disagreed with Monroe's decision to buy Louisiana, it doubled the size of the US. Their second acquisition was Florida. Because of the Seminoles constantly invading Georgia, the Georgians wanted Monroe to control this. Monroe sent Andrew Jackson to get the Seminoles out of Georgia but he attacked Florida with 1700 soldiers. Spain got mad at Jackson but Adams said that there is no reason to get mad at Jackson, Spain should "Govern or Get out". Spain did exactly that and for $5 million dollars, the US bought Florida from Spain. America then conquered Texas by having settlers move there and then later going to war and being victorious. A couple days later, Congress annexed Texas as the 28th state. Next, the US took Oregon . 4 countries claimed it but when Russia and Spain fled the area, only the US and Britain had control of the area. Polk wanted to conquer all of Oregon but when the British said that they would make a treaty where the US got the lower half of Oregon and the British got the upper half, it was an offer he couldn't refuse (this was mainly because the treaty allowed for no bloodshed). America bought California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, part of Colorado, New Mexico and Wyoming for $15 million and promised to take care of the Mexicans that already settled there (this promise wasn't kept). The treaty was ratified and the states mentioned above became part of the US. The last part of the acquisitions was the Gadsden Purchase. For $10 million dollars, James Gadsden purchased the Mexican Cession.

A moral dilemma is either     A. doing what is morally wrong results in a good outcome (say, murdering a mugger in self-defense) or  B. doing what is morally right results in a bad outcome (letting the mugger kill you because murder is a disgusting response).    "Many moral dilemmas are dilemmas because of a certain kind of conflict between the rightness or wrongness of the actions and the goodness or badness of the consequences of the actions. " So these hypothetical dilemmas are unnecessarily extreme, but they provoke a lot of ethical consideration.    "Utilitarianism is the idea that the moral worth of an action is determined solely by its contribution to overall utility: that is, its contribution to happiness or pleasure as summed among all persons."    Classic Utilitarian ethics seek to produce the most pleasure.  Negative Utilitarianism seeks to produce the least harm.  Total Utilitarianism measures the total pleasure across society that is caused by one action.  By contrast, Average Utilitarianism measures the pleasure that is caused by one action of any one representative member of society.    Okay, classic moral dilemma. "You are an inmate in a concentration camp. A sadistic guard is about to hang your son who tried to escape and wants you to pull the chair from underneath him. He says that if you don't he will not only kill your son but some other innocent inmate as well. You don't have any doubt that he means what he says. What should you do?"     A classic utilitarian would at according to what would cause pleasure (perhaps killing the guard?). A negative utilitarian would probably kill the son to save the life of the innocent, thus causing less harm to less people. A total utilitarian might not kill the son because it causes great pain to oneself and the son    Advantages: it is very clear and quantifiable. Society as a whole might improve. We might not just think of other people, but plants and animals that usually don't get a vote in cognitive realms.  Disadvantages: life isn't neat and tidy. One lives for one's own happiness, not society's. Even if you always act for society, you're really acting to please yourself (giving yourself a moral gold star). An individual can't act so rationally that he acts against self-serving/self-preserving survival instincts. You have to live with your choices day-to-day. Also, how can one assume equality, that everyone wants same thing and will reasonably attain it by similar means? How does one quantify the happiness of a plant or animal, which clearly does not want the same thing as humans.    Now, Kant's categorical imperative. This is much harder, and you will need to delve A LOT deeper. "A utilitarian says that murder is wrong because it does not maximize good for the greatest number of people, but this is irrelevant to someone who is concerned only with maximizing the positive outcome for himself." You're going to kill a mugger in self-defense no matter what you say in response to a hypothetical dilemma: end of freakin' discussion.  That is could leave you and society in a moral sewer. "Consequently, Kant argued, hypothetical moral systems cannot persuade moral action or be regarded as bases for moral judgments against others. ...In Kant's view, a moral act is one that would be right for any person in similar circumstances to those in which the agent finds himself when he executes it." The key here is ANY person. No special treatment for women or the handicapped or you because your son is in a concentration camp. Universality is Kant's First Formulation. There are no means to an end. The mean is treated as the end itself. When you kill the mugger, you kill him. You have killed. Period. No need to look further into society or anything like that. Killing to spare another is totally irrational. So even though you'd do it, you'd be wrong because it doesn't pass muster.    Advantages: Not a lot of gray area. Addresses individual imperatives.  Disadvantages: assumes that the "everyman" is desirable.
ktcIhaYCaa	Spanish Flu    It was a massive disaster.    It killed more people people than WW1 and possibly WW2 combined.    It killed as many as 25 million in its first 25 weeks (in contrast, AIDS killed 25 million in its first 25 years)
PlkU4Zghaa	Blame Germany for the war, and place restrictions so that it would never be able to rise to military power again. This included the occupation of the Rhinelands, military restrictions, the guilt clause and war reparations.  France was very firmly in support of this especially because of all the physical damaged it had suffered, as well as it's geographic proximity to Germany should anything ever happen again in the future.    The powers also wanted to create a lasting peace that would embrace ideas of self-determination and collective security. Wilson's 14 points were submitted at this time, and the League of Nations was formed from his suggestions.
dZujkbmVaa	I would think something along the lines of the easiest route is not always the best.  Or maybe that you should take time to stop and smell the roses, so to speak.

My only word of caution is that Catholic churches can get a little funky when it comes to music. Depending on the diocese, they may not allow anything not on the "approved list". We ran into it with the funerals for a couple of family members in the last 8 years.     If she was a very simple woman and the church does give you a hassle, you might consider something as powerful and straightforward as "Amazing Grace".or "I Can Only Imagine" by Mercy Me.|`|U1chPjvPaa	Funerals are to comfort the living, and to help us get closure.

I would like to give our song to you.      I'll be seeing you  In all the old familiar places  That this heart of mine embraces  All day through.    In that small cafe;  The park across the way;  The children's carousel;  The chestnut trees;  The wishin' well.    I'll be seeing you  In every lovely summer's day;  In every thing that's light and gay.  I'll always think of you that way.    I'll find you  In the morning sun  And when the night is new.  I'll be looking at the moon,  But I'll be seeing you.    I'll be seeing you  In every lovely summer's day;  In every thing that's light and gay.  I'll always think of you that way.    I'll find you  In the morning sun  And when the night is new.  I'll be looking at the moon,  But I'll be seeing you.|`|GkK44x4Raa	I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your grandmother.    I think the Bowman Family sings a wonderful song that helps signify where our family has gone and that one day we will be reunited.    Here are the lyrics:    We read of a city John saw coming down from God out of Heaven,  The walls are of Jasper, the gates are of Pearl, the streets of pure gold;  He tells of a pure river of life that flows from the throne,  And after we've reached that beautiful place we'll know as we're known.    Let's meet by the river over on that beautiful shore,  Let's meet by the river where loved ones dwell who've gone on before;  If you leave here first just wait by the river,  If I leave you here that's where you'll find me,  Let's meet by the river over on that beautiful shore.    If you leave me standing here on this earth just wait by the river,  It's such a good place for us to meet over there;  And after I find you let's go see Jesus,  Then let's go find our Dad and our Mother,  Let's meet by the river over on that beautiful shore.    Let's meet by the river over on that beautiful shore,  Let's meet by the river where loved ones dwell who've gone on before;  If you leave here first just wait by the river,  If I leave you here that's where you'll find me,  Let's meet by the river over on that beautiful shore.    Let's meet by the river over on that beautiful shore!|`|zDwXyOl3aa	I've heard the song before, so I don't need to hear it again. My sister and her daughters sang it at my mom's funeral in a Mormon church, almost a year ago. It's beautiful and comforting at the same time. God is the same and listens with both ears and arms wide open,  wherever and whomever we are. The closure we get from funerals is because we are allowed to do things in the honor of the deceased. This is the tribute to her life. If it brings you comfort and fills your heart with the love that you felt for her, then it is right.   May you also find your comfort in His arms. God bless you for recognizing the beauty with in her,

TSAl7ZX1aa	Take your portrait, duplicate the layer and posterise it at the lowest level, this will give you simple tonal separations. Cover the darkest portions with your type (I would use Illustrator for this but you could do it in Photoshop).

f4d1b694bbe5d754965c49f945a6756daa	comparing Lincoln and Obama, hmm    Lincoln was born in Kentucky, but lived in Illinois when he left for the White House  Obama was born in Hawaii, but lived in Illinois when he left for the White House    Both were members of the Illinois Bar.     Both had served in the Illinois General Assembly.      Lincoln was an enthusiastic supporter of the 13th Amendment, and was immensely proud, according to his friend Ward Lamon's book Remembrances of Abraham Lincoln, that the Illinois General Assembly was the first legislature to ratify that amendment.     Obama represents a group who ultimately benefitted from the 13th Amendment. While his mother was a US citizen, his father was from Kenya, though his ancestry still makes him African-American, because his parents represent both continents. In most instances, we think of African Americans as being folks who were born here, and whose ancestors may have been slaves generations ago, and while the President "does not have that honor" to paraphrase Charlie Chaplin's reply to the question whether he was a Jew, as an African American he does represent that group.     Nationwide, Lincoln represented a minority, that is Republicans, who won the election because the Democratic vote was divided along regional lines.     Obama represents a minority, nationwide.     But in a larger sense, to borrow a phrase from the Gettysburg Address, they each represented "not black America, not white America, but the United States of America".|`|90yjyha0aa	Lincoln abolished slavery - Obama became president... there couldn't be more of a direct connection than that.|`|khuhK4Gpaa	Both are from Illinois. Umm, Licoln tried helping the african-americans, while Obama is African-american. (see the connection yet?)|`|pXlY8eoNaa	They had similar backgrounds, both Chicago attorneys who spent eight years in the Illinois legislature and two in the U.S. Congress before running for president. They both underwent an unlikely rise to power from relative obscurity.

uJBnZWtcaa	Here's some original digital drawing.  This young man is celebrating his new tablet and he's not digitally tracing - although that's what I do - and he's using good old MS Paint.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&hl=en...    Any decent paint program will do the job from Artrage (cheap) to Painter Essentials (a little more $) to PhotoImpact ($$) to Painter ($$$$).  Most photo editing programs dont' have the best drawing/painting tools.  Get a program designed to do art.    1. You can use "layers".  Open the digital copy of your artwork then create a new layer above it.  Lower the opacity of the top layer so you can look through it and see your artwork underneath.  Then pick out your tools and draw.    2. Painter Essentials and Painter have photo clone functions.  Basically, they put a layer over your photo for you.  You can clone paint in both programs, too.  You put on the brushstrokes while the program samples the colors on the photo for you.    (Sometimes I find it's easier and quicker to just take a digital photo of my sketches.  I'm going to rework them anyway so why scan?)|`|cpwpOwiSaa	If you're asking "How do I turn my sketches into computer art" then they most likely draw the image first and then trace over it with a program such as Photoshop or Illustrator. If I were them, I'd use the Pen Tool/Bezier Curve Tool or the Pencil/Paintbrush. Google it for more info.

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.    The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."

There are many books that offer a "look inside this book" feature. Click on it, type in the term(s) you are looking for, search, read the sentence and then decide if that's the page to look on. If so, you can click and read the whole page, but you only get one chance.    You may not even need to go this far if you have the copy of the book and can check pages. Even if the version you have doesn't offer the search inside feature, you can probably use another and get close to the right page. The link it just to the first copy of the book listed on Amazon.

I feel kind of sorry for his daughter, if in fact he has one and isn't just one more thirteen year old of whatever gender thinking they're clever. Certainly his writing offers no proof of either his intelligence or his maturity and I fail to see why I, or anyone else, should care about his opinion of Twilight.

HBrIHYrMaa	The major plot involves Jean Valjean who is released from prison, and through the kindness of Father Myriel, becomes a new man. He gets a new name via association with Myriel and his obvious kindness and generosity to others and gradually builds a successful and prosperous life for himself with a renovation of the jet-work industry in Montreuil-surmer. One of his employees is-although unknown to him-fired by the head mistress because of an illegitimate baby. Fantine goes from one occupation to another, finally becoming a prostitute.     A minor incident takes place in the streets, and Fantine is arrested by Javert. Valjean, who has become known as Mayor Madeleine, forces Javert to release her and takes her into his own house when he hears her story. Fantine is in extremely poor health, however, and dies without ever seeing her child again, even though Valjean had promised to get the child.     Meanwhile, another man has been arrested and mistakenly identified as Valjean. Valjean appears in court, revealing the truth and losing both his business and his position in Montreuil-sur-mer. Although he is arrested, he breaks out long enough to hide his fortune. He spends additional time in prison, working aboard a ship. Eventually he escapes again and retrieves Cosette from the evil Thenardiers whom Fantine had trusted to take care of the child.     Then begins 10 years of hiding, moving from place to place, always staying just ahead of Javert. Seven or eight happy years are spend in a convent where Valjean works with the gardener and Cosette attends a girls school.     Feeling that Cosette must have opportunity to experience all of life, they leave the convent when she is about 15. Valjean is nearly betrayed and recaptured due to the insidious if somewhat unwitting deeds of the Thenardiers.     While Valjean is continuously on the lookout for people who might have guessed his identity and makes their home always in out of the way places, Cosette becomes aware of her own femininity and beauty. She and Marius spot each other and fall in love.     Marius is a college student who has been raised by his grandfather after the old man had disowned his son-in-law for supporting Napoleon. Marius discovers the truth about his father shortly after his death and enmity develops between himself and his grandfather. With little income, Marius in unable to marry Cosette and prevent Valjean from taking her away again, and his grandfather refuses to give consent for a marriage to someone he assumes is beneath him.     In Paris, politics, work issues, and various unsatisfactory conditions are gradually bringing a faction of workers and college students to the point of revolt. An insurrection takes place; Marius joins in hoping to die since he will not be able to have Cosette. Valjean joins the insurrection because he believes he is losing Cosettes love and because, although he hates him bitterly, he intends to try to protect Marius for Cosette.     When the barricades are finally overtaken, Valjean rescues Marius and escapes through the city sewers. Marius is unconscious and does not know who rescued him. When his health returns, he insists once again on marrying Cosette, and this time the grandfather relents. Old wounds are at least partially healed. As Javert is also dead, it would seem that Cosette, Valjean, Marius and his grandfather could all form one happy family. Cosette and Marius marry, but Valjean reveals the truth of himself to Marius who gradually banishes him from even seeing Cosette.     The Thenardiers are a continuous nuisance and occasionally a real threat throughout the book, but in spite of Thenardiers intention to bring harm to Valjean, he actually reveals the truth of Valjeans history to Marius.     Valjean dies in the end, but it is with contentment after a joyful reunion with Cosette. He is content to know that Cosette and Marius have forgiven him, although it seems as though Valjean himself is the one who has the right to be on the forgiving end of things.|`|iyhMF4HKaa	A hot girl got..

all of the white keys (7) and all of the black keys (5) between an octave    an octave is the distance between which the hertz is doubled    orchestras typically tune to A440 for example, where 440 Hz is the speed of vibration in one second - 440 vibrations per second - if anything resonant vibrates at 440 times per second it will make the tone of this A    so the difference between A and the next higher A is 440 up to 880 - and so on    for lower notes the vibrations are divided in half - so the octave lower than A440 is 220, and so on and so on    here's a list of the Hertz of a piano  1 A 27.5000  2 A  29.1352  3 B 30.8677  4 C1 32.7032  5 C 1 34.6478  6 D1 36.7081  7 D 1 38.8909  8 E1 41.2034  9 F1 43.6535  10 F 1 46.2493  11 G1 48.9994  12 G 1 51.9131  13 A1 55.0000  14 A 1 58.2705  15 B1 61.7354  16 C2 65.4064  17 C 2 69.2957  18 D2 73.4162  19 D 2 77.7817  20 E2 82.4069  21 F2 87.3071  22 F 2 92.4986  23 G2 97.9989  24 G 2 103.8262  25 A2 110.0000  26 A 2 116.5409  27 B2 123.4708  28 C3 130.8128  29 C 3 138.5913  30 D3 146.8324  31 D 3 155.5635  32 E3 164.8138  33 F3 174.6141  34 F 3 184.9972  35 G3 195.9977  36 G 3 207.6523  37 A3 220.0000  38 A 3 233.0819  39 B3 246.9417  40 C4 261.6256 Middle C  41 C 4 277.1826  42 D4 293.6648  43 D 4 311.1270  44 E4 329.6276  45 F4 349.2282  46 F 4 369.9944  47 G4 391.9954  48 G 4 415.3047  49 A4 440.0000  50 A 4 466.1638  51 B4 493.8833  52 C5 523.2511  53 C 5 554.3653  54 D5 587.3295  55 D 5 622.2540  56 E5 659.2551  57 F5 698.4565  58 F 5 739.9888  59 G5 783.9909  60 G 5 830.6094  61 A5 880.0000  62 A 5 932.3275  63 B5 987.7666  64 C6 1,046.5023  65 C 6 1,108.7305  66 D6 1,174.6591  67 D 6 1,244.5079  68 E6 1,318.5102  69 F6 1,396.9129  70 F 6 1,479.9777  71 G6 1,567.9817  72 G 6 1,661.2188  73 A6 1,760.0000  74 A 6 1,864.6550  75 B6 1,975.5332  76 C7 2,093.0045  77 C 7 2,217.4610  78 D7 2,349.3181  79 D 7 2,489.0159  80 E7 2,637.0205  81 F7 2,793.8259  82 F 7 2,959.9554  83 G7 3,135.9635  84 G 7 3,322.4376  85 A7 3,520.0000  86 A 7 3,729.3101  87 B7 3,951.0664  88 C8 4,186.0090       sooooo ANYWAY...    ok, so in "western" music - this range of Hertz doubling is divided into these 12 steps - called the "chromatic scale" (playing all of the white and black keys in a piano octave)    to play a MAJOR SCALE you skip some of these notes    between each of these 12 steps is what is called a "half-step"  if you skip a half-step it is called a "whole-step"    the MAJOR SCALE is as follows    WHOLE STEP  WHOLE STEP  HALF STEP  WHOLE STEP  WHOLE STEP  WHOLE STEP  HALF STEP    or often abbreviated:  W-W-H-W-W-W-H    if you notice, equating a W with 2 (two half steps) and equating an H with 1 (a half step) and adding them together the Ws and Hs add up to 12    the Ws and Hs themselves do not represent notes, but rather the spaces between the notes    this is regardless of what instrument you're playing - or what resonant object you are vibrating while increasing the Hertz as illustrated in the diagram above, to the point where the Hertz are doubled, making an OCTAVE    nearly anything can vibrate to create a tone - an odd example would be the source for the "light saber" sound in the early Star Wars movies - I heard that Lucas and his sound crew went to powerline pole supporting cables and vibrated the cables (the ones that support the poles, that go into the ground at 45 degree angles, not the powerlines themselves, otherwise they'd probably be dead) and vibrated them to make that "BVVVHHHH" sound when the light sabers moved through the air    ((But on a tangent side note, powerline cables do have a vibrational frequency themselves, you can sometimes hear the "hum" of powerlines if it's quiet enough - and that's because they're vibrating at the rate of the amperage that is passing through them, or something or other - I'm not an electrician, but you may have heard what I'm referring to - a quiet hum    this is also why transfer stations have to be on the same frequency otherwise there'd be a major problem (also why an individual couldn't have their own solar panel and feed electricity into a powerline without maintaining that same frequency - hence currently (no pun intended) solar panels are for personal use and not to make money by 'selling' electricity into the power grid as it wouldn't be really cost effective having your own transfer station harmonizer or whatever...))    but anyway that's a major tangent...    so the scale is divided into 12 half steps    a MAJOR scale is W-W-H-W-W-W-H    and for example a "natural minor" scale is ~sortof~ different:  W-H-W-W-H-W-W    but actually it is similar because the ratios are the same - it just starts on a different note    if you play a G scale, but you start on the A and play to the next A, you're playing A harmonic minor because the WWHWWWH stays the same but starts on the|`|GkJpR0eIaa	1234 123 1234 12345  54321 321 4321 321

vLnS4JJaaa	Young in New Orleans       starving there, sitting around the bars,  and at night walking the streets for  hours,  the moonlight always seemed fake  to me, maybe it was,  and in the French Quarter I watched  the horses and buggies going by,  everybody sitting high in the open  carriages, the black driver, and in  back the man and the woman,  usually young and always white.  and I was always white.  and hardly charmed by the   world.  New Orleans was a place to  hide.  I could piss away my life,  unmolested.  except for the rats.  the rats in my dark small room  very much resented sharing it  with me.  they were large and fearless  and stared at me with eyes  that spoke   an unblinking  death.    women were beyond me.  they saw something  depraved.  there was one waitress  a little older than  I, she rather smiled,  lingered when she  brought my  coffee.    that was plenty for   me, that was  enough.    there was something about  that city, though  it didn't let me feel guilty  that I had no feeling for the  things so many others  needed.  it let me alone.    sitting up in my bed  the llights out,  hearing the outside  sounds,  lifting my cheap  bottle of wine,  letting the warmth of  the grape  enter  me  as I heard the rats   moving about the  room,  I preferred them  to  humans.    being lost,  being crazy maybe  is not so bad  if you can be  that way  undisturbed.    New Orleans gave me  that.  nobody ever called  my name.    no telephone,  no car,  no job,  no  anything.    me and the   rats  and my youth,  one time,  that time  I knew  even through the  nothingness,  it was a   celebration  of something not to  do  but only  know.

Also, it is unlikely to show, unless it is gold or silver. White will absorb into the cloth and just look dirty.  Your best bet is to go to the fabric art aisle at your nearest Michaels or whatever craft store is closest to you, and get a small bottle of 3-D paint. They are very inexpensive, and the paint stays on top of the surface, without spreading, and they come in a variety of textures, from glittery to shiny, to puffy (you can heat set it with a hair dryer).

o16Z34u6aa	As First Lady Mary spent a good deal of time refurbishing the White House. She also made many trips to hospitals to take food, flowers, etc. to injured soldiers. She read to the soldiers, wrote them letters, and once raised $1,000 for the Christmas dinner at a military hospital. Tad often accompanied her on these visits to see the soldiers. (Willie had died in the White House early in 1862; Robert was away at college.) Additionally, Mary provided support for the Contraband Relief Association which helped blacks who came to the North during the Civil War.    She was opposed to slavery, and she strongly supported her husband's pro-Union policies. On the other hand, Mary received criticism for her numerous shopping sprees and because many of her relatives had chosen to side with the South in the war. Several relatives died fighting for the Confederacy. Mary caused controversy as First Lady; she made both friends and enemies while her husband was president.

Google MS Paint and Bamboo for more links.  Here's one that's interesting:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?gl=GB&hl=en...|`|uUzS3W5qaa	No, not at all. I've been drawing with a tablet since I was 12 and I've only ever worked with that size. It may seem small to you though, especially since your first one was so large...     The tablets have gotten bigger, so the really large ones are kind of cumbersome. My old 4x5 Intuos2 was the size of a mousepad and was really portable. My current Intuos3 is 4x6 and occupies the same amount of space as a 8.5x11 letter paper so it's a considerable hunk of desk space that you lose. I can't imagine trying to accommodate anything bigger.

Take a year or two at a community college, take regular and art classes, practice and send off your portfolio to art colleges.     Community colleges even have classes on how to put together a portfolio.|`|amcqJkWhaa	I have no idea.   But I think somewhere sometime I heard that... people in colleges don't have communication skills as the people who kind of interview them would like, and so if you have that maybe you'll have an edge or something.   And my elder sister tells me college is a business... and you might not learn that much, but colleges will have got your money anyhow.   My dad tells me, colleges are really the same, and it's more about what you put into it--your studies-- than what they have to offer, I suppose...   Although my second eldest sister says that Harvard has a reputation, and so it has a distinction from all the other colleges... it's also really really expensive.   But then my dad says colleges are like places where they make you into Liberals... so maybe professors also try to move you along left-wing.     But, I suppose colleges are nothing more than buildings, it's own microcosm, representative of what you may find in the outside world... perhaps.     Art colleges, at least some of them, look for talented people, or "people who show promise" or are "original, expressive minds". But then again, some art colleges don't even require a portfolio, or so my friend says, so maybe it's more about the money than other things. And art colleges kinda scare me, they seem to be a coming together of things wild. Maybe education and art, are sorta incompatible, but, oh anyhow...    Have you asked your parents this question? They may have some very colorful answers for you.|`|tsj1so8eaa	to be able to spell college.

The only thing i can suggest is , BELIEVE.|`|FoIxsunVaa	If you actually feel the way you do, which I have felt, then you would be incapable of committing suicide because that would require CARING if you lived or died. I suspect that you ARE depressed and that you are feeling the disaffection that comes with it. It's like feeling different than everyone else (alienated) but in this case the person you feel disconnected from is YOU.    You may need to seek professional help. But I know that you aren't really feeling like that right now. On the issue of major bad happening, depression is not a reaction to bad events, that is called sadness. Depression is a hole you fall into emotionally. You sound in pretty deep. Get someone to give you a hand getting out.    Good Luck.|`|BiWbEMXtaa	I believe everyone feels like this at some point, to a certain extent.

Peace.|`|dbTPyM7Yaa	You do need counseling, though. It sounds like the winter doldrums. Finding something you love can put the spark back in your life. Are you walking at least 30 minutes a day? If not, work your way up to that for a start.     Look at the catalogs of some universities you might like. Find a class that interests you and take it.     This feeling does go away, but you have to do something to help it along. If you aren't climbing out of the hole, you are slipping back down into it. So to speak.    Here are some possibilities:  Keep a journal and put in at least 3 - 5 things a day you are grateful for. Even if it has to be dumb things to start with.  At least one day a week do 5 kind things for others. It must be 5 things in one day to get the effect -it lifts you.  Try a new hobby.  Take a class just for fun at the local community college or leisure learning organization.  Cut back on TV and computer time. It doesn't have to be hours a day, just cut back by some amount you can commit to.  Play a pick up game of some sort once a week.  Get a part-time job that looks like fun, not just a lot of work.  Do you live at home with your parents? If so, make dinner -a good one- once a week.  Take over a family chore.  Learn something about nutrition and improve your diet by that much. I recommend going to http://www.realage.com -their tips are quick to read and easy to incorporate.    Just pick a few of these, don't try to do them all.|`|ugKQuggFaa	I think you need to go see someone for this problem, but here is a way that might take you out of that mood swing: try joining a sports team just to be part of something and have fun so that way you will feel needed.|`|FyszvGyWaa	Very interesting.

7f7a52e305734e0a60a00a89605dd353aa	Many instances of book banning in recent history have resulted from the school boards.  Instances include Savannah, GA in 1999 banned many works of Shakespear.  In 1996 the school board in Merrimack, NH also banned Twelfth Night.  In 1989 Little Red Riding Hood was banned in two California school districts.  However, far and away, most efforts to ban a book from a library originates from a parent.    In 1985, Tipper Gore formed the Parents Music Resource Group which sought to censor music.  This obviously is not "book" banning but it is still actively attempting to curb the First Amendment Rights through the use of censorship.  Another group which offers legal advice to parties trying to censor books in schools is the Christian Law Association.

Blows my mind every time:    A graphic novel is a type of comic book, usually with a lengthy and complex storyline similar to those of novels, and aimed at all audiences, generally speaking.

Mangas are Japanese, usually in black and white, have scrawny guys and girls for the most part (even if the girls DO tend to be on the busty side), and either ridiculously simple plot lines or incredibly intricate plot lines.

Not the kind of book that gives you a "wow" or anything. I'm pretty surprised that its considered as a literature book.|`|FX7dedVcaa	It keeps being mentioned in the film "Conspiracy Theory".  You can read something about it here:     "The reference to The Catcher in the Rye was taken from real life, for Mark David Chapman, the assassin of ex-Beatle John Lennon, had a paperback edition of the book in his possession when the police arrived and found him standing "very calmly" as if he too was a mind-controlled assassin, having completed his task, and now aimlessly standing about, waiting to be arrested as the lone gunman? But Chapman was not alone: John Hinckley was also reported to have been obsessed with the book and as both lone gunmen were considered by some to be coming of the MK-ULTRA robotic assassin production line, the book was soon interpreted as a driver in their mind control  and thus how this conspiracy theory made it into the movie Conspiracy Theory. "    You can find further information here:

I think after Paradise Lost, you should go on to Privilege because it might take a while for the eleventh book to come out. You can read Last Christmas whenever. I actually read it after I read Legacy and it didn't confuse me or anything.

According to what I just learned about this painting, it was commissioned to sell cigars. From that, we can draw that they are trying to associate smoking their brand with having a good time with the boys. I don't know what to make of the card being passed, I assume that they are cheating.

govCVZySaa	The reason might be because your voice is slightly changing again.  Throughout your life, your voice changes a lot and it will change your ability to sing.  Eventually, you'll get used to it, so I'd suggest that you try to get more familiar with your singing voice by doing some excercises...and wait.  Good luck!!!    *addition*  I am having the same problem...except for the fact that I'm going through puberty, and that will change your voice a lot.  I totally understand what's happening to you, and I know that it's not fun.  I'd suggest that you keep on trying, and NOT GIVE UP.  I feel for ya...
VOZWgWgLaa	The "Indian Wars" were considered an internal American affair by the US government. The government negotiated treaties with tribes from time to time, but they were always with the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Department of the Interior, not the Department of State, which would be the department you'd want to talk to for foreign affairs.    The traditional "end" of the "Indian Wars" is the Wounded Knee Massacre in 1890 in which US troops from the 7th Cavalry massacred many old, sick, and very young Lakota (Sioux) Indians, and they were largely trying to comply with the soldier's orders. The reason it is viewed as the end of the Indian Wars because after the massacre, there were no instances of large groups of armed indians attacking white settlers.    This however can be open to interpretation, because different tribes fought longer then others. After the Battle of the Little Bighorn, the US army launched a massive campaign to crush the northern plains tribes, the Lakota and Chyenne. They were starved and forced to fight in winter. Shortly after the 1876 victory, both the Lakota and Chyenne had been forced onto reservations or exile, and their ability to resist what the US government was doing to them was broken. The people at Wounded Knee were in no way shape or form warriors, and were only there to take part in the Ghost Dance Spiritual movement, but the stength of these tribes had been broken much earlier.    The only tribe to actually fight long against the US Cavalry after the date of the Little Bighorn Battle, were the Apache, who fought a guerilla war in the desert southwest, and they held out until 1886 when Geronimo finally surrendered for good.    And the only great military campaign after Little Bighorn was the fight with Chief Joseph's Nez Perce in 1877, and even then, Joseph was trying to flee the US military, not fight it.

GLS7vgAdaa	There are quite a few things you could do. Please note that upon trying any of them you should be sufficiently warmed up already.     1. Stand against a wall with your heels touching the baseboard. Lift one leg in front of you, keeping both legs locked and have a friend SLOWLY take your leg up as high as you can go. Make sure your hips are level and your butt and stationary heel are touching that wall. Have her hold the leg as long as you can stand it. You should feel a definite stretch in your hamstrings as you loosen them more.   2. Again start against a wall, heels touching the baseboard. Squat down, with hands touching the floor on either side of your legs during the whole exercise. Start to raise up and as you do, take one leg behind you, going up the wall. Slowly press your leg up as high as you can. The ultimate goal is to have no space between both legs and the wall. You're essentially doing a split up the wall instead of on the floor.   3. Lay on the floor, with your lower back pressed into the floor. Take one leg and press your knee into your stomach. Hold it there while you feel a little stretch. Then, by grasping your calf  slowly extend the leg up to your ear and hold it. You probably won't be able to straighten that leg at first but make sure the stationary leg doesn't bend or move. After you've stretched your leg out as far as it can go and you've held it a while, roll your body toward the leg until you're off your back and you've rolled into an actual split. Keep your nose to your knee (or as close as possible) and roll back, retracing your steps to bring your leg back down.     Hope this helps! I really wish i could show you this as it's easier to show you than to write the steps. Best of luck!|`|0cxXH78faa	what i like to do is lunges,  they work wonders,   also, while in your lunge, put your elbows down on the ground and rock back in forth.    also, really really REALLY deep plie's (a grande' plie' in 2nd basically)    and while on the floor, have the front leg straight, and back leg bent (kind of like in a split, only not all the way) and then go over. and then switch so its back leg straight front leg bent.    I hope you get your splits.  :)    if you have any more questions, just message me @ baileyyk@aol.com|`|j4bmtqWRaa	do the splits every day until you can go all the way|`|qGUscHyLaa	Here are some split stretches:  1. Kneel on one knee and tuck your bum in (as if you are trying to touch your belly button to your pelvis). Repeat on other side.  2. Sit in a butterfly position (feet together, legs opened apart). Push your knees to the ground  3. Legs in front, keep straight and touch your toes. Keep your back as straight as possible and try to touch your stomach to your knees.  4. Sit on one of your heels, and keep your other leg in front and fully stretched. Lay on your back without unbending your knee.  Hope I helped!  Elle

xJoMSkI5aa	Published in a collection of poems called Songs of Experience in 1794, Blake wrote "The Tyger" during his more radical period. He wrote most of his major works during this time, often railing against oppressive institutions like the church or the monarchy, or any and all cultural traditions  sexist, racist, or classist  which stifled imagination or passion.    Shakespeare's sonnets are considered a treasure trove for trying to understand his personal life. Not much is known about the guy, but scholars have made tons of inferences based largely on these poems. The first seventeen sonnets are thought to be Shakespeare addressing a young man and telling him to go make some babies. The last sonnets are thought to be written to Shakespeares mistress, whom scholars awesomely call the "Dark Lady." The middle poems, though, of which Sonnet 18 is the first, are generally thought to be love poems directed at a young man (check out Sonnet 20, where this is more obvious).

MqoOPi9Xaa	The western front is where the Germans fought the French, British, and Dutch. Most of the fighting occured in trenches along the Magniot line (a long french fortification along the entire eastern side of France. Many Americans think that it is because of USA that Germany lost when its quite the contrary. About 1,300,000 French died on the western front along with 900,000 British. That is compared to only 50,000 Americans because America only entered WW1 in the last 2 years of the war and they barely even started fighting until the last year. There was a Southern front where germany faced Italy when Italy backstabbed Germany. The eastern front was Germany and Austria-Hungary against the Russians. I'm not sure if the Austrian-Hungarians actually fought in the western front you'll have to look that up and i believe when Germany surronded Britain with submarines to stop merchant ships from coming in is also considered part of the Western front.|`|zuqv3qR1aa	primarly france|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	The Central Powers were engaged in a two front war.

It was defined by a series of trenches, along which a constant war-stalemate existed, until the arrival of US troops - along with the key allied victory of Vittoria Veneto in 1918, which by itself shattered Germany's main ally, the Austro-Hungarian empire - shifted the war in favor of the Allies.

0cf4Qja5aa	Out fitting an entire Dance Ministry?  Think shopping materials,patterns and asking the question: How many of you girls have sewing machines and experience to match.  Hire some one to cut the fabric and away you go.  By nature sewing is a social event, everyone gets input in relation to the pattern and no one can suggest that you were not frugal with the church money.  Definitely error on the side of caution on this one and schedule everything well in advance.    I would not suggest on line purchase, you really need to get some other members involved because you should not put yourself at risk of becoming responsible for where the monies are being spent and the choice of the finial purchase.

A 32nd is HALF the sixteenth    As for extra info, try SINGLES (drumroll), DOUBLES (your sticking goes like LL-RR-LL-RR etc., TRIPLETS (the accent is the uppercase) lrL rlR, ONE HANDED TRIPLETS (LLL-RRR-LLL-RRR etc), and PARADIDDLE (RLRRLRLL) a double paradiddle is RLRRLRLLRLRRLRLL.
