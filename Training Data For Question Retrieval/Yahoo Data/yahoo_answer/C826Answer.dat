N53iI8weaa	I tried putting some toilet water behind my ears one day but the seat fell down|`|HMhUKAgkaa	When my brother and I were little we gave our little sister a lolipop that we dunked in the toilet first. She ate it but she was only like 2 so she had no idea that there was anything wrong with it. We just laughed at her. I'm glad now that it didn't make her sick!|`|LDMV3WUTaa	Well, basically when YOU drink "tap water" that's what YOU are drinking, because "tap water", the water out of a faucet, that's would be the same as drinking "toilet water".

This is about my simplest dinner recipe. It can use the cheapest cuts of meat, makes its own apple sauce, and the juices make a fabulous gravy. Nothing is wasted.     PORK IN CIDER    Serves 2     INGREDIENTS    250ml of cider  1 apple  1 onion  2 pork chops or steaks    METHOD    Pour the cider into a measuring jug. Peel and core the apple, cut it into thick slices and put them into the cider to stop them going brown. Peel the onion and chop it into tiny pieces.    Put the onion in the bottom of an ovenproof dish with a lid. Put the meat on top. Add the cider. Arrange the apple slices on top of the pork. Put the lid on the dish.     Cook in a preheated oven at 150C, 300F, gas mark 2 for about 2 hours. Check the liquid level from time to time and top it up if it starts to dry out.     ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    Stir 2 heaped teaspoons of gravy granules into the onion and cider left in the dish to make the most delicious gravy.     TIPS    Any cheap cider (that doesnt have the word white in the name) will do. The long, slow cooking in the alcohol tenderises even the cheapest meat.

AA11042493	Try the new Mission Life Balance Plus. They have 16% of your daily fiber and have added vitamins and calcium. They taste like flour tortilla but the fiber makes them more filling and healthy. To loose weight eat more fiber rich foods (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans), exercise and drink about 1/2-3/4 gallon of cold water every day. Your body has to heat this cold water and burns calories.|`|167fece8d1c403c1739e29d8437b4f98aa	I Absolutely love pita chips instead of tortilla chips.

bZud91iuaa	First brown your meat in a little vegetable oil.  Make sure you season the flour with salt and pepper (about a tablespoon of each) when you coat the meat pieces with the flour.  If you're using a Dutch oven brown the meat right in the Dutch oven.  When done browning remove the meat and drain off excess oil, but leave the browned flour in the bottom.    Take a little red wine and deglaze the drippings so they are not stuck to the bottom.    Add your onions, tomato, celery, carrots and any other veggies to the pot and add back your meat, add your stock.    As the stew cooks you will get more moisture and juices from the stock and meats.  Take a cup or a little more, of the stock out of the pot, add about 1/2 stick of butter a little at a time until it melts in the stock.  Add cornstarch to the mixture a small amount at a time so it doesn't lump up.  The roux should have a consistency of ice cream that has just started to melt.  Add the roux a little (1 tablespoon) at a time and then let it cook for 5 minutes so you can see how thick the gravy is getting. When you get your gravy to the desired consistency salt and pepper to taste, add 1/2 cup red wine, stir and serve.      I make a sage butter, slather a piece of hearty artisan bread with it and place it in the bottom of the bowl and put the stew on top.    God I'm getting hungry!!|`|AA12198711	You have to season the stew gravy. Salt, pepper, etc. The seasoning makes all the difference.     I make mine with flour, make a rue and then I add chicken or beef stock to add flavor and get the consistency I want.     Seasonings!|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	When I make a stew that seems a little lifeless I add a package of instant brown gravy which I have deluded with water.  It really helps.|`|QWN8KNCPaa	try adding the flour once you have browned the stew,then graually add stock slowly simmer to allow flavour to go into stew,once cooked colour with gravy browning|`|nOVSf06Raa	To make your stew with a gravy you need to put your meat into a bit of flour first then you lightly brown it into a bit of oil add your vegetables and water and let it simmer  stirring often to avoid the stew from sticking to the pot the procedure will give your stew the gravy texture that you require , if you like you can even add some dumplings to the stew and if you are using a slow cooker/crockpot there is no need to lift the lid .|`|3VSZsXJ1aa	well i've always used the flour rue and corn starch, i had 2 heaping tablespoons of the flour in the beginning when im sauting the onions, cook it for 5 min then add the stock or ingredients... for corn starch, the stew has to have a certain level of liquid for it to work well, the less there is the better.... as well for the flavor part, i would just cook the meat longer, maybe 2 - 2.5 hrs so everythings fork tender.... another way of thickening up soups is by adding canned beans, when your stew is done, you could use a potato masher and crush those beans in and it'll definitely make your stew thicker and more rich, good luck!

8bh0IGwJaa	Hmmm that sounds interesting!  I can only assume you make a traditional cannoli filling and add cocoa powder and red food coloring to it!    Room temp ricotta and cream cheese or mascarpone is very important.    So, 1 tub drained ricotta, 1 tub mascarpone cheese  or cream cheese @ room temp and combined with a blender.  Then add in 1 and a 1/2 cups powdered sugar, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, and 1 whole little squeeze bottle of red food coloring.  Blend with a blender.  Add in 1 bag of chocolate chips and 1/2 tub COOL WHIP and fold to combine.    Taste and see if it needs a dash of cinnamon.    Fill cannoli shells!  And maybe dip one end in melted chocolate.      (FYI, sometimes, when I make cannoli filling, I use ricotta, mascarpone and 1 can of vanilla pudding -- the already made kind.  It is really good!)|`|nOVSf06Raa	the Original Cannoli is from Sicily and if you want to make them you can make your own shells or to make it easier you buy those from an Italian store I have found a recipe for you,    http://www.cooks.com/rec/doc/0,1918,1541...      here is a video that will give a little more insight on the making of Cannoli.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HpgkZypa...|`|5cvPPWjEaa	INGREDIENTS   1 cup confectioners' sugar   1 pint part-skim ricotta cheese   1/2 cup blanched slivered almonds   1/3 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips   1 tablespoon amaretto liqueur   12 cannoli shells     1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar   1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder   12 maraschino cherries       you can directions about how t ot make it on site   http://www.foodsndrink.blogspot.com   find out the given links

Like saying milk chocolate contains milk (surely the clue is in the title!) or a pack of fishcakes contains fish (I sure hope so).     But, people do miss those points - and companies are trying to protect themselves from any lawsuits.     Just like the case of the man who ironed his shirt while wearing it and then wondered why he got burnt. He sued the company as there were no warnings on the iron or the box.

MIlpLLZcaa	Pineapples contain an enzyme called bromelain, it begins to separate the peptide bonds that build amino acids into proteins. The good news is that your tongue regenerates these cells, so you won't be left with permanent damage. Once you have consumed the pineapple (or bromelain), your body begins metabolizing it and soon renders it harmless. The pineapple you had could have been a bit under ripe, the tannins in the tea could have helped along the effect of the enzyme.

64a4NB15aa	here is a list of items you will need :  a plastic bucket   some type of grain ( corn , wheat , rye , barley ETC. )  sugar   cake yeast ( brewers and the cake stuff in the store are the same )  an old pressure cooker ( make sure pressure Gage works )  about 4 ' copper tubing   an open close valve for the tubing  Place the grain in the bucket and fill with water .Let stand a few days till it starts to sour : then add the sugar . Once you see it foaming up get your cake yeast in there .It will really foam now . When the foam stops is when you put it into the pressure cooker . At this point it will be like wine or beer .  Make a coil with the copper tubing . Solder it to the release nipple on the lid of the pressure cooker cut the tubing above that point and affix your valve at this place .  Seal off the pot and close the valve .Let the pressure build with the valve closed . Do not leave it alone pressure will build fairly quickly .Before it gets critical you want to open the valve and let the system do what it is built to do .From this beginning you can learn to do double and triple distilling . You can then experiment with adding flavors and spices .  Remember if you do not watch the pressure it can blow , this is not something you can leave alone and go take a nap .This is the small scale simple set up . By law you are allowed to produce 2 gallons an year for your private consumption .

Moonshine is corn flour or pure sugar converted to a beer/wort and then distilled. There's equipment and ingredients and science involved that just can't be skipped, especially in the distillation stage. You could probably make a small amount in your kitchen with a beaker and condenser setup, but it'd amount to a glassful at the end.    In the end, unless you make and sell enough to offset the costs of equipment and ingredients it's going to be cheaper to buy liquor.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Ask my cousin billy bob Joe frown deep southern Tennessee... he knows.

An Indian friend of mine had a ongoing curry and no fridge - he just threw something into the big saucepan on his stove every day, mixed it with whatever was left in the bottom, a few random spices, brought it to the boil, and you could guarantee a different curry every time you visited him!    You would expect to have different flavours if it had been left standing; these would have leached out of the component parts and combined together.

AA11537580	it would contain less pesticides but if you just peel your fruit anyway then it is no better.|`|AA12031316	Sure it is, if its truly organic, for several reasons.  First, organics don't have the pesticide residues and growth stimulants that are on commercial goods.  Think of the very word pestiCIDE. Or herbiCIDE, or fungiCIDE-like suiCIDE and homiCIDE, it means to die.  I don't think consuming something designed to kill something else can be a good thing, and those residues cannot be rinsed off-they are taken up by the produce as it grows.  Commercial produce is often imported from other countries who use pesticides banned for us in the US, so you could be getting all sorts of unsafe toxins.  Second, almost ALL commercially produced foods are genetically modified to make the crops more pest resistant.  GMO is scary business-frankenfoods!  I choose organic at all times, and grow as much of my own stuff as I can.    Anyone who thinks there is no difference should really research the issue.  Especially anyone with any type of chronic illness or pain.  Its often toxic "food" causing the problem.  In my case, I was crippled for many years, diagnosed with all sorts of chronic ailments.  When I switched to a strictly organic diet, I healed completely.  Turns out I was allergic to the high MSG content in pesticides, and was reacting to allergens in genetically modified food.  If I eat anything non organic now, I am right back to being sick.  Again, if you think there is no difference, you would be better off doing your research.|`|V6pE6S7iaa	i think its equal i eat  some organic and some natural food all healthy of course  but for example  organic pita chips and soups they taste great but just as good as natural ingredient foods i wouldn't go for fake products but natural is just as good as organic  like fresh fruit the organic fresh fruit is dry tasting  but the original is sweeter  natural food is just mainly same as organic but the listed items may have some things to keep and maintain freshness    I practically eat eggs  potatoes  bananas  apples  kraft american singles or polly twist cheese  blue diamond almonds or store brand cashews  deli turkey or lean ham  whole wheat bread  organic whole wheat cereal  i mean really it comes down to price also

an1b4pXxaa	I've had it a couple of times, it was okay, haven't eaten it enough to really judge. I have a teenage kid that won't eat anything 'weird' so it's easier not to buy it, it's not cheaper than beef either.  I think it's good to see it available in the supermarkets even if I don't often choose to buy it. I do buy roo pet food for my cats every week. And I don't have a problem with kangaroos being killed for human food or pet meat.  Harvesting roo is probably better for the environment than all those hard hoofed animals compacting the ground.|`|I40vnqNyaa	Its quite a dark meat and a little gamey (sp?).  They do say though that it is the leanest red meat you can get, so its a very healthy meat.  I kinda agree with you in principal but the concept is a little hard to swallow, if you'll pardon the pun. lol|`|18f4aeb76a3e8aee506482a962921d26aa	Never eaten it, but I have fed it to my dog. I'm sure it's perfectly edible, is probably low in cholesterol and roos are becoming a bit of a menace in Australia.  Camels are also becoming a problem in Australia and camel meat is also low in cholesterol.  However I don't think I would eat Australians. I suspect Australians are fairly high in cholesterol.|`|TyWGsPDlaa	I'm not australian, but I have tried it before. I liked it, and I would eat it again! It's kind of like a leaner beef taste, almost like lamb? Everytime I say that to someone though, they think I'm off.    I saw this recipe on youtube and thought it looked good. haha    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-_oHcgss...|`|t6xao8D0aa	1 - Have you heard of it before?  Yes  2 - Have you had it before? No  3 - Did you like it? N/A  4 - Do you prefer it over beef? N/A  5 - What do you think of Roo meat as a whole? N/A    I'm American, never had the chance to try it. My father studied in Australia in college and had it, said it tasted somewhere between beef and lamb and gamey.  Knowing the environmental problems Australia has had with Kangaroo overpopulation, I don't have any problem with hunting them for market meat.|`|mzbpDgPVaa	Hey dear I'm completely unknown about this  SORRYYYYYYYYYY                          -Sabi

uFRIsdC7aa	General Tso's Chicken  1 lb chicken thighs, boned and cubed   3 eggs, beaten   1/2 cup cornstarch, plus   2 teaspoons cornstarch   5 dried chili pods   1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar   2 tablespoons rice wine   3 tablespoons sugar   3 tablespoons soy sauce     In a large bowl, thoroughly blend the 1/2 cup of cornstarch and the eggs; add the chicken and toss to coat.   If the mixture is too thick, add some vegetable oil to separate the pieces.   In a small bowl, prepare the sauce mixture by combining the 2 tsp cornstarch with the wine, vinegar, sugar and soy sauce.   First-Stage Frying: Heat 1-2 inches of peanut oil in a wok to medium-high heat (350-400).   Fry the chicken in small batches, just long enough to cook the chicken through.   Remove the chicken to absorbent paper and allow to stand (this step can be performed well in advance, along with the sauce mixture, with both refrigerated).   Second-Stage Frying: Leave a tablespoon or two of the oil in the wok.   Add the pepper pods to the oil and stir-fry briefly, awakening the aroma but not burning them.   Return the chicken to the wok and stir-fry until the pieces are crispy brown.   The General's Favorite Sauce: Add the sauce-mixture to the wok, tossing over the heat until the sauce caramelizes into a glaze (1-2 minutes).   Serve immediately.   Serves 4, along with steamed broccoli and rice.|`|AA12198711	General Tsos Chicken Recipe    At nearly any buffet or take-out place you can find General Tsos Chicken. General Tsos Chicken is a perfect combination of sweet and spicy flavors. It is a very popular dish throughout the United States and Canada. This is probably one of the best and easiest recipes around, you will be surprised at how little time it takes to prepare. I decided to get brave and use the boneless skinless chicken thighs, and I wasnt disappointed. However, If you want to use chicken breasts that would work fine as well. The sauce keeps it nice and simple with only a few necessary ingredients to create the perfect generals sauce. For the frying  its your choice if you want to use a deep fryer or wok. What I did was first deep fry the chicken and then fry it in the wok for a few minutes before adding the sauce. What this does is give the chicken bits a spicy flavor coming from the dried chilies that are fried in the oil. If you are looking for an amazing recipe for General Tsos chicken give this one a try. Serve on top of white rice. Enjoy.      1lb boneless skinless chicken thighs (cut into 1 chunks)  5 dried red chili peppers  3 green onions (sliced)  3 eggs (beaten)  ? cup cornstarch  oil (for frying)  Sauce-  1 ? tablespoons rice vinegar  2 tablespoons rice wine  3 tablespoons sugar  3 tablespoons soy sauce  2 teaspoons cornstarch     In a large mixing bowl combine cornstarch and beaten eggs. Mix well to create a batter. Add chicken bits and coat thoroughly.    To make the sauce- in a small bowl combine rice vinegar, rice wine, soy sauce, sugar and cornstarch. Mix well and set aside.    Heat deep fryer or wok to 375 degrees and deep fried chicken bits in batches. Drain on paper towels.     Add 1-2 tablespoons of oil to your wok. Add dried chili peppers to your wok and stir fry for 30 seconds. Add chicken bits to the wok and stir fry for a couple minutes.     Add sauce mixture to the wok and cook stirring until the sauce becomes thickened and bubbly. Garnish with green onions and serve.|`|7Q7dFghmaa	1 part MSG and 2 parts cat.

This is even better than the BEST I have had in my fave Chinese restaurant. To make the meal go quickly prep everything the day or night before and store in the fridge. To make this easy to understand I have changed the terms to cornstarch slurry and sauce. The first is used to coat the chicken for frying, the second to coat the fried chicken. HTH I use a grater with small holes for the ginger and garlic or you can just zip all the sauce ingredients up in a blender or food processor. Enjoy!   by mama's kitchen   40 min | 20 min prep     SERVES 8     3 lbs boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into chunks   2 cups green onions, sliced   8 small dried chilies, seeds removed (chile pequin, bird's eye, etc..)

If you make this ahead of time just refrigerate until needed, shaking it again when you are ready to use it.   Mix cornstarch slurry in a large bowl- the mixture will be strange but trust me it works. Add chicken pieces to coat. Using a fork remove ONE chicken piece at a time and let the excess mixture drip off. Add it to the hot (350 degree) oil and fry until crispy. Only cook 7 or 8 chicken pieces at a time.   Drain on paper towels. Repeating until all chicken is fried.   In a separate wok or large skillet add a small amount of oil and heat to 400 degrees.   Add green onions and hot peppers and stir fry about 30 seconds.   Stir sauce mixture, and then add to pan with onions and peppers, cook until thick. If it gets too thick, add a little water.   Add chicken to sauce in wok, and cook until all is hot and bubbly.

JQZmyZRyaa	To make pretend buttermilk, add 1-3/4 tablespoons of cream of tartar to a cup of milk, or add a tablespoon of lemon juice or white vinegar to a cup of milk and let it stand for 5 to 10 minutes. In many baking recipes, you can also just use plain yogurt or sour cream instead of buttermilk.     The only thing I could find on white butter its just butter made special for commercial use.

I40vnqNyaa	No it wont ruin your food. Chicken tends to retain more juices and be more moist when it is cooked on the bone, especially when it is cooked in a slow cooker, it will probably turn out better.  Leaving the skin on will obviously just make the fat content of your meal higher, If it bothers you, you can take it off but i wouldnt worry about it.   It will be fine.  I would use it just as it is :)|`|dAn9koABaa	hi its very easy to take the bone out and take the skin of , it depends what you are making but i would not worry to much ,|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Have you ever thought of removing the skin yourself?

Proverb      Have you noticed, that vegans and vegetarians are always hungry? Have you also noticed, that they are always in a perpetual state of indignation and anger?    Our bodies are fantastic machines, and they produce instincts in reaction to stimuli - some of which we have learned to repress. Our craving for chocolates and/or something sweet is partly from our natural urge to diversify our diets to increase our intake of essential vitamins and minerals. In ancient times, after we killed our dinner, we would get our vitamins from fruits and berries. This craving stays with us today.    We also are driven to aggression by the lack of animal protein. You must have noticed that when you eat in a Chinese restaurant, you are hungry two hours or so later? This is due to the large amount of vegetables and small amount of meat. (This was more true in the old days of reasonable portions!)    Vegetarians are always hungry. Those of you who have vegetarian friends, can attest to this.    Just like the animals of the savannah, the lions can lie about relaxing between high protein kills, while the antelope and vegetarian animals must nervously eat and eat and eat the whole day long in order to get enough food. They too, are always hungry. They too are angry. In fact, the most dangerous animal in Africa is not the lion, but the vegetarian hippo.    As Jared Diamond said in his "The Rise and Fall of the Third Chimpanzee":    That transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture is generally considered a decisive step in our progress, when we at last acquired the stable food supply and leisure time prerequisite to the great accomplishments of modern civilization. In fact, careful examination of that transition suggests another conclusion: for most people the transition brought infectious diseases, malnutrition, and a shorter lifespan. For human society in general it worsened the relative lot of women and introduced class-based inequality. More than any other milestone along the path from chimpanzeehood to humanity, agriculture inextricably combines causes of our rise and our fall...   ...recent discoveries suggest that the adoption of agriculture, supposedly our most decisive step towards a better life, was actually a milestone for the worse as well as for the better. With agriculture came not only greatly increased food production and food storage, but also the gross social and sexual inequality, the disease and despotism, that curse modern human existence.    Small and mean!    Many modern cases illustrate how improved childhood nutrition leads to taller adults: for instance, we stoop to pass through doorways of medieval castles built for a shorter, malnourished population. Paleopathologists studying ancient skeletons from Greece and Turkey found a striking parallel. The average height of hunter-gatherers in that region towards the end of the Ice Age was a generous 5 foot 10 inches for men, 5 foot 6 inches for women. With the adoption of agriculture, height crashed, reaching by 4000 BC a low value of only 5 foot 3 inches for men, 5 foot 1 inch for women. By classical times, heights were very slowly on the rise again, but modern Greeks and Turks have still not regained the heights of their healthy hunter-gatherer ancestors. (Source: Jared Diamond - ibid)    It is no coincidence that the modern era of warfare began about the same time. Farmers were constantly in need of land - which had to be taken away from the hunter/gatherers.    Anthropologists know...    Anthropologists have long known that vegetarian tribes, while smaller in stature than omnivorous tribes, are far more dangerous and war like. They are also more territorial.    When our body needs food, it indicates this to us with the feeling of hunger. But there are also other signals if specific nutrients are deficient. Meat is the best source of several nutrients. When our bodies are deficient in these, we become irritable and aggressive. This is a perfectly natural signal built into our genetic make-up over our evolution: our bodies are telling us to go out and kill something to eat. This is why strict vegetarians tend to be so vociferous. It is a trait that was recognised long ago; it was, after all, the vegetarian Cain who killed the carnivorous Abel, not the other way round. The vegan Kikuyu tribe in Kenya were the perpetrators of the murderous Mau Mau in the 1950s, not their wholly carnivorous, but peaceful, neighbours, the Maasai.    Finally, the mere fact that agriculture encouraged people to clump together in crowded societies, many of which then carried on trade with other crowded societies, led to the spread of parasites and infectious disease. (Some archaeologists think it was the crowding, rather than agriculture, that promoted disease, but this is a chicken-and-egg argument, because crowding encourages agriculture and vice|`|F0uLexezaa	it's very difficult without family support but stick to it and they'll get the message|`|llkSmgLJaa	Get support from your 2 vegetarian friends and ignore the rest.

It is difficult especially within the family unit to accept something that may seem so far outside their normal routine.  You just need to try to make some compromises of sorts.  Don't avoid meals with the family - just work around them.  Fill up on the non-meat items, maybe sprinkle some cheese or nuts on them for an added boost.  Or are you going strictly vegan (no animal products of any kind)?      Either way, your family and friends should grow to accept your decision.  Just don't expect them to follow suit and don't be judgemental about their lifestyles, because they will likely openly eat meat in front of you and even try to tempt you with some for quite a while.

Skeptics say that since it is an animal origin food it should be designated as non-vegetarian and not consumed after infancy as it is then not required. On the other hand, pro-milk drinkers say that milk is a vegetarian food since it is not procured by killing the animal and does not consist of any animal part. Vegans do not consume any milk or milk based product.   No one can live without eating  vegetables and fruits, so everyone is a vegeratian . But those  ignorants/cruel/dumb people who eat meat/egg kill innocent lives, eat  tamasik food and hence are meatarians.    2. Milk is not meat. Extracting milk, does not pain or trouble cows. It's a  satvik diet having beneficial effect on mind and body. So there is no harm  in consuming milk. Ofcourse using injections on animals to increase milk,  denying milk to calves is a sin.    3. those who get into this debate of milk being vegetarian or not should  first understand that the reason of banning certain foods for civilized  humans is 2 folds:  a. It harms your own mind/body  b. it troubles/kills/ pains other living beings.    Anything that satisfies either of above 2 criteria, is 'abhakshya' food  (non-eatable). Everything else is Bhakshya (eatable). That's why in satyarth  prakash rishi doesn't get into debate of veg-non veg. he talks of Bhakshya  and Abhakshya food and clearly classifies meat as Abhakshya on above 2  criteria.|`|Vw6koNV3aa	it is not a vegetable, but u can say it as veg......|`|IP2UxPj0aa	The Concept of being vegetarian is to consume food that doesnt involve killing of animals/birds/fishes..i.e,, living things.

Veganism is actually really hard. I did it for 6 months but it was incredibly difficult. They even sneak milk into tomato ketchup. With veganism you really are cutting out a LOT of foods. Basically, you are only eating things that grow from the ground.     If you really want to do it, try vegetarianism first.

KtdlJbrOaa	Using margarine in place of butter will not affect the size or texture of the cookie.  Sounds like she needed a bit more flour.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	yes... margarine has water in there too.  Actually, you should substitute Crisco for the butter anyways (you can use Butter Crisco).  Crisco makes the cookies softer;  butter will make them spread more on the pan|`|AA10283080	Not enough flour.    Adding a little extra flour will help.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Something got left out; you really should use butter though instead of margarine. Margarine isn't particularly good for you.    This can also happen if you don't use enough flour or egg.|`|nOVSf06Raa	not every recipe is meant to be changed if they call for butter then butter must be used unless specified , about the flat cookies perhaps she has greased the cookie sheet and when certain cookies are made the fat contents will melt and make a puddle causing the batter to spread out a little more than required so you must read the recipe and see if it says grease cookie sheet or bake into an ungreased cookie sheet .  Now if the cookies are too flat perhaps like pan cakes they are still usable you can fill them with ice cream and place them into the freezer .    http://bakingbites.com/wp-content/upload...|`|AA10928232	If the margarine had water added to it, possibly.    I'm more likely to suspect that her bakind soda is old and no longer active.  So adding it didn't matter... it still didn't cause the cookies to rise.    chiling the dough before scooping into portions also helps|`|bC0KRacHaa	Yes, that can definitely be part of the reason.  Or also if the butter was too soft.  you need the butter to be still cold to hold up the cookies as they bake.  They'd come out flat if you used melted butter, too, instead of just softened room-temperature butter.|`|363ec7d105356694f6582d94dc89714eaa	Did the recipe call for baking POWDER?

TQCSwCpQaa	Bechamel is one of the "Mother Sauces" and is a great base to add to and to take in different directions.  It really depends on what you're putting it on or how you're incorporating it into a larger dish.  It's just equal part fat (usually butter - Cajun cooking uses oil) and flour with the addition of milk or cream.  If you add cheese, it becomes a mornay sauce.

AA11173395	First, it is scientifically impossible for a nutritional deficiency to develop in one month, then be cured overnight.   The lessening of the pain in your hip is more likely related to how you were sitting during dinner, than to what you consumed.    If it happens again, see a chiropractor.  It's a simple adjustment.  And unlike MDs, nutrition courses are a requirement for chiros.    About 20% of the population cannot absorb B-12 from dietary sources, so having eaten meat for years is no guarantee.  Pernicious anemia is related to this absorption mechanism, and is not affected by the food one eats.    In addition, meat contains protein, iron, zinc, and the b vitamins riboflavin and thiamin.    Protein is found in beans, nuts, seed, lentils, meat substitutes, potatoes, etc. Outside of famine conditions, protein deficiency is all but unheard of. Generally speaking, if you consume enough calories, youre getting enough protein.    You only require between 8 and 11 mg of iron per day. This is easily obtained with one cup of fortified breakfast cereal, or one serving of tofu. Beans and whole grains are also good sources.  Unless you eat liver, meat isn't even the best source of iron.    Zinc is found in beans, nuts, whole grains, fortified breakfast cereals, and dairy products.    Riboflavin in found in dark green leafy vegetables, mushrooms, asparagus and broccoli.    Thiamin is found in whole grains, nuts, sunflower seeds, peas, milk, cauliflower, spinach and legumes.|`|Scupj6XVaa	maybe you could call your doctor and set up a checkup.  ask them if maybe you were lacking in something and thats why. that's crazy tho, i would just keep eating some kind of animal protein every day just in case.|`|zJi5Cjpiaa	well you better start eating more vegetables and fruit then, whole grains too|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Iron perhaps? You should really consult a physician or nutritionist about this. I think you sound like you're better off just eating meat in moderation, rather than trying to go all veg.|`|de641317a0696a8d53df9d1538305a2baa	Okay.  Scott?  There's a reason you're a meataholic.  You are missing something in your diet that causes you to have the craving for it.  You need to find out what that is.  Consider your going completely off meat, experiencing the pain and then removing the pain by eating the fish and the pork sausage "an Experiment."  Now, the next step is to find out what you are missing that Meat provides.  Is it the protein?  Is it the iron?  Is it  the enzymes?  You can experiment with vitamins, or you could, like everyone else is telling you, experiment with eating the meat in moderation.  I suggest the latter.  Humans were not put on this earth to pop pills.  That's in itself not healthy.  Look for organic, free range and other more-healthy meat choices.  And I hope you find the answers you seek.  Good luck.|`|kMK9E2a7aa	You are probably suffering from hypochondria. You are possibly worrying too much. Go see a doctor and get some tests done, that would be the best person to ask.

A small spherical piece of dough, originally made from the middle of a ring doughnut, may be cooked as a doughnut hole.

It is nothing more than fried bread dough . The flavors and fillings are just our constant affinity for sweet tastes , but its still fried bread dough .  I see people talking about egg and flour here so I need to add this . Eggs are added to egg bread and have nothing to do with the determination .   Flour this is funny . the variety of wheat and the milling process determin to which type of baking it is best suited not the color . You can use all purpose to make cakes or bread . there is also such thing as unlevened bread . This does not have yeast added but is still let to rise using the idea of sour dough without souring .|`|xsaXZSDFaa	It's close but not exactly a cake because its so soft and deep fried rather then baked

Well actually, it might make him gain weight if he ate a shitload of them, but it won't make him monstrous.|`|gGZz2EGyaa	I do not think that one bone will make him fat.  My old Lab used to love bones from the butcher, they are good for their teeth.

KtdlJbrOaa	I would cook both in a crock pot with onions and garlic.  Add potatoes and carrots.  Salt, pepper, rosemary.  For the liquid, I would do either chicken broth or white wine.  You could even add a can of cream of mushroom.  It should turn out like a nice hearty stew.    Another idea would be a classic French cassoulet, just substitute the chicken & sausage you already have:    broiler-fryer chicken, cut up, about 2 1/2 pounds  4 to 6 sweet Italian sausages  1 1/2 cups chopped onion  1 large clove garlic, finely minced  1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley   1 large can (15 ounces) tomato sauce  1 cup dry white wine  1 teaspoon salt  1/2 teaspoon coarse black pepper  1 bay leaf  3 large cans (about 16 to 20 ounces each) Great Northern Beans, about 6 to 7 cups cooked beans    In a Dutch oven, cook bacon until crisp; transfer to paper towels to drain. In bacon drippings, brown sausages and chicken on both sides, about 10 minutes each side. Transfer chicken and sausages to a shallow baking pan as they are browned. Bake at 375 for about 15 minutes.  To remaining drippings in Dutch oven, add chopped onion, garlic, and parsley; cook over medium low heat until onion begins to yellow, about 5 to 7 minutes. Add tomato sauce, wine, salt, pepper, and bay leaf; bring to a boil. Reduce heat; add drained beats and stir well. Remove chicken and sausages from oven and add to the Dutch oven. If Dutch oven is not ovenproof, transfer to a large ovenproof pot or casserole. Sprinkle bacon over casserole; bake at 375 for 45 minutes. Cassoulet with chicken and Italian sausages serves 6.|`|owsJc0uGaa	chop some chunky onions fry in a pan till golden add pre browned chicken thighs, sausages, ( veg if you want )add chicken stock.  (you can add tin of tomatoes if you fancy a tomato ish sauce) boil then simmer for 1hr.  you can add garlic spice if you like that sort of thing.|`|AA10928232	Sugar Pies Chicken & Sausage Gumbo    ? cup A/P flour  ? cup veg. oil  1 whole cut up chicken, breasts cut in half, or 8 of your favorite chicken parts  2 cups chopped onion (about 2 small)  2 cups chopped celery (about 5 ribs)  ? of a bellpepper, chopped (I like red for color, & less bitter than green)  5-6 garlic cloves, sliced  1 lb. smoked sausage or andouille (AHN-dewey), sliced  1 (14 oz.) can petite diced tomatoes, w/ juice  8 cups chicken stock  2 bay leaves  2 Tbsp. Tony Chacheres (less if chicken stock is salty)  Salt and Black pepper to taste  Handful of chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley    1. Start by making a roux. In a big, heavy Dutch oven, add flour and oil to pot and set over medium heat. With a flat-bottomed spoon, stir roux, scraping the bottom clean with eat motion. Slowly, the flour will begin to darken. You can smell it caramelizing. Slowly take it to the color of milk chocolate for best flavor, or at least dark caramel. Stir almost constantly or it will burn, especially once the darkening has begun.   2. When your roux reaches the right color, add chicken pieces skin side down. Turn heat up to med-high or even high, depending upon your stove. The goal right now is to brown the chicken well, not cook them through. If they will not all easily fit in the bottom of the Dutch oven, brown them in 2 batches. Remove browned chicken to plate; set aside.  3. Add sliced sausage or andouille to pot, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes. Remove to plate w/ chicken.  4. Add onions, celery, and bellpepper to the roux. Stir well to coat, and cook about 3-5 minutes until wilted. Add garlic, and cook 2-3 minutes more.  5. Return chicken and sausage to pot, and add tomatoes, chicken stock, bay leaves, Tony Chacheres, and any additional salt or pepper to suit your taste.  6. Bring pot of gumbo to a simmer over high heat, then cover w/ lid and reduce heat to low. Stir occasionally and simmer about an hour. Remove lid and stir; simmer another 15 minutes. Stir in chopped parsley just before serving.  7. To serve, place steamed rice in the bottom of a bowl, and top with a chicken piece and sausage slices and gumbo liquid as desired.    NOTES:  ** If the roux burns (you can smell a scorch and it has black flecks in it), throw it out, wash your pot, and start over on a lower heat setting. Keep stirring; most roux is ruined by walking away.    ** If you are coordinated, you can chop your meat and veggies stove-side while stirring your roux. If not, chop before you begin your roux to give it your full attention.  ----------------------    Delicious & Easy Crockpot Roast     1 chuck or rump Beef Roast (sized for your crockpot)   ?

Sausages again they can go in a casserole with carrots and potatoes, little onion, sauce or gravy.  I cheated one day with a recipe I saw for sausages and using a jar of Big Ben Chinese Stir Fry Sweet n Sour, cooked the sausages as normal, then cut them into 3 or 4 parts.  Add the sausages to the jar of Big Ben and simmer for 20 minutes and serve with rice.

I would also take multivitamins to pick up trace elements that you will be missing by going completely vegan.  I found this site to be particularly helpful.  Hope it helps you.    http://www.wikihow.com/Become-a-Vegan|`|b73296a75da0c37af734e3ef9c03113baa	Smokey just gave you some misinformation -- He is right that you will need to be sure to include a source of B12 in your diet but he is wrong that it is only found in flesh foods. B12 is plentiful in Tempeh and in Nutritional Yeast. Miso has some too.  Great information and recipes at:   www.your-vegetarian-kitchen.com  goveg.com  veg123.com  To be vegan, you avoid all flesh foods and anything that exploits an animal. So no leather, no wool, no silk. No honey either and definitely no dairy products. I am not sure about pets -- that has always been a bit of a confusion in their doctrine for me. But all grain, beans, peas, legumes, fruit and nuts and seeds, all vegetables and vegetable oils and nut butters are all fine. Read labels. Avoid anything that contains casein which is from milk, carmine which comes from the carapace of a beetle, or mono-and dy-glycerides which can come from Beef Tallow. Avoid shortening, lard and McDonald's fries. and please -- relax and have fun with this.|`|AA10645224	THERE ARE MANY VEGAN WEBSITES WITH COOKBOOKS FOR FREE  FIND ONE OR MANY    GOOGLE.COM  LIVE.COM    UNTIL YOU START PAYING FOR YOUR OWN FOOD YOU'LL HAVE TO EAT WHAT YOU GET|`|E0rJfuZcaa	I must warn you that becoming a vegan is very difficult and, if you don't do it properly, can get dangerous for your health.

6f4f7d14ae8b69e50ccaf068c55c7152aa	Brining is more appropriate with poultry and red and white meat than with fish and shellfish.    Brining has the impact of making the meat moister but also note that most times you brine, you proceed to roast the meat (as opposed to the quick stirfry you were doing with the shrimp)    I do not brine seafood    That being said, this article discusses the benefits of brining and also advocates brining shrimp.   An interesting read    http://www.finecooking.com/articles/why-...|`|7cUDstdjaa	Soaking in salt water will remove any nasty tastes that may have arisen from the shrimps being packed for a while.  However, if you soak the shrimps in water with garlic salt or garlic powder, they will taste terrific.  If your shrimp were overcooked it had nothing to do with the water you soaked them in, you cooked them for too long.  Once the shrimp become opaque, then they are cooked. Any more and they will become tough and lose their flavour.  Better luck next time.|`|wPM6eBkWaa	No clue.  Maybe to add moisture, kind of like a brine.  To bad they came out over-cooked, nothing worse then over-cooked shrimp.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	No, it's to season the shrimp. Soaking it in the salt water will help some of the salt penetrate and make it taste better. By absorbing some of the moisture as well, more flavors from the stir fry can penetrate the shrimp. This is the same principle behind any sort of marinade.     The reason they tasted overcooked because soaking and then trying the shrimp like them will cause them to cook much faster. It's a good idea, but try not cooking them as long as you normally would. As soon as they turn pink, they're donzo.|`|nOVSf06Raa	it depends on the cook 's habit and way of cooking we all have a way to prepare food .  I know that if you have frozen shrimp you can defrost them be putting them into cold water as far is the addition of salt I believe this to be an option ,some use salt to remove impurities since salt is a cleanser so there is absolutely nothing wrong with this ,but if we need to watch our salt intake it might effect the taste if the recipe calls for salt I would omit it of coarse this is totally up to you .    http://www.fishex.com/|`|I40vnqNyaa	If your seafood is fresh it shouldn't need plumping up or brining.

Keep it simple, cook quickly and they will always taste great :)|`|JQZmyZRyaa	No.  I have never heard of that and I don't understand why they would do that.  To thaw shrimp quickly you only need to run cold water over it for a couple of minutes.|`|CJvHQl5vaa	It actually ADDS water to the shrimp.  It is called brining, and a lot of seafood comes pre-brined.  It plumps up the seafood, adding moisture.    I have no idea why your recipe called for brining the shrimp.  Usually the reason seafood producers brine their shrimp and other seafood is to add weight so you end up paying more for the seafood.  I go out of my way to buy shrimp that has not been brined, actually.  Also, brining covers up the fishy taste that sometimes comes with seafood that is past it's prime.      Seafood is not the only thing that you can brine, by the way.  Many people brine turkeys, usually in a solution of salt, sugar and water and herbs, usually to keep it plump and moist.  My Father-in-law once brined the Thanksgiving turkey in apple cider.  It was delicious!  In the case of something like a turkey or a chicken, you would soak it for hours, not minutes.  Along the same lines, while not technically brining, my husband soaks whole chickens in buttermilk and herbs before roasting it.  The idea is to add moisture so you don't dry out the bird during cooking.      Seafood doesn't stand up to brining the way poultry does, however, and it can make shrimp awfully tough.  Next time, consider just rinsing the shrimp with regular water and see if that keeps them tender

A good trick is to leave the solution for a few minutes prior to using the cleaning brushes. Once you have finished with the cleaning brush's rinse off the remaining cleaning solution with cold or warm water and leave to dry.    The hookah hose can be cleaned with the same lemon juice solution as above but you should dilute it with even more water so to easily pass through the hookah hose. Cover the one end of the hose and pour the cleaning solution in from the other end, cover up both ends and shake the hookah hose so that the solution washes around internally (make sure to keep both hookah hose ends well covered) Drain the solution out of the hookah hose and repeat several times. Rinse out with warm water and leave to dry.

n7KCez59aa	Hi !    Water, lemonade, hot or cold tea, Gatorade, fruit juice or lime water would be a great substitute.

If you like that bubbly taste try drinking sparkling water every time you crave soda.|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	Try getting some plain carbonated water, like perrier (or just soda water.. it's just carbon, it's calorie free!) and some crystal light drink mix (which is about 10 calories) in a flavor you like, or some other low-calorie drink mix like that. Don't use anything like koolaid. So your basically just making low-calorie pop with carbonated water instead of all that sugar and crap... Should give you the pop-satisfaction of being bubbly and sweet but without all the crap :) You can also look for flavored carbonated water, I know we often call it "fizz" around here but every store has their own brand name for it :)    Juice and things like gatorade or vitamin water are usually almost as bad for you as pop.. It's just pop without the carbination, so avoid those.|`|qZaOvstaaa	I buy plain sparkling water (Faygo is the cheapest I know of) and mix it with lemonade or orange juice (about 1/2 & 1/2).

Perfect Sugar Cookies    2/3 cup shortening  2/3 cup butter  1 1/2 cups sugar  2 eggs  2 teaspoons vanilla   3 1/2 cups flour   2 teaspoons baking powder  1 tsp salt     Preheat oven to 350*  Cream together shortening, butter and sugar.  Stir in the eggs and vanilla.  Combine the flour, salt and powder and blend into the creamed mixture.   Shape into balls and place on ungreased cookie sheets.   Bake for 10-12 minutes or until lightly golden brown.  * You may also roll them in some sugar just before placing on the cookie sheets for some extra decoration!|`|jCHcjJ9Baa	some good recipes here    http://www.robinhood.ca/homepage.asp?lid...|`|AA10928232	Butterscotch Refrigerator Cookies    ? cup butter  1 cup brown sugar  1 egg  1 tsp. vanilla extract  2/3 cup chopped Nut meats, raisins or coconut  2 cups flour  ? tsp. cream of tartar  ? tsp. baking soda    Beat butter and brown sugar well.  Add slightly beaten egg  and vanilla to sugar mixture.    Soft together flour, cream of tartar, and baking soda.  Add this to the sugar mixture, combining well.    Add nuts, mold into roll, and wrap in waxed paper or plastic film for at least 2 hours in fridge.  Dough will keep for a week in fridge in waxed paper or plastic.    When ready to bake, cut dough into thin slices, place on greased cookie sheet, and bake at 400oF for 8 minutes.    --The College Womans Cookbook, 1934  ---------------------    Sugar Pecan Cookies (Pecan Sandies)    1 cup finely ground pecans   1/2 cup margarine at room temp.   1/2 cup butter at room temp.   1/2 cup confectioner's sugar   2 cups All Purpose flour   2 tsp. vanilla   Confectioner's Sugar for dusting, about 1/2 cup     Prepare cookie sheets with parchment paper or lightly grease them.  Mix the 6 ingredients listed in order given until well combined.  Roll up into a ball and wrap in plastic wrap or waxed paper.  Chill at least one hour.     Preheat oven to 350oF.     Use a small cookie scoop to make balls or roll into 1" balls by hand and flatten on sheets using a glass bottom dipped in sugar or heel of hand.  Bake 11-12 minutes. Cool 2 minutes and cool on racks.  When cold, sprinkle with confectioner's sugar.     Makes 2-3 dozen, depending on size. If desired, do not chill dough and use a cookie press.  Bake less time as needed for a smaller cookie.  ----------------------    PALMIERS    2 cups granulated sugar   1/8 teaspoon kosher salt   2 sheets puff pastry, defrosted (recommended: Pepperidge Farm)     Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.   Combine the sugar and kosher salt. Pour 1 cup of the sugar/salt mixture on a flat surface such as wooden board or marble. Unfold each sheet of puff pastry onto the sugar and pour 1/2 cup of the sugar mixture on top, spreading it evenly on the puff pastry. This is not about sprinkling, it's about an even covering of sugar. With a rolling pin, roll the dough until it's 13 by 13-inches square and the sugar is pressed into the puff pastry on top and bottom. Fold the sides of the square towards the center so they go halfway to the middle. Fold them again so the two folds meet exactly at the middle of the dough. Then fold 1 half over the other half as though closing a book. You will have 6 layers. Slice the dough into 3/8-inch slices and place the slices, cut side up, on baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Place the second sheet of pastry on the sugared board, sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of sugar mixture, and continue as above. (There will be quite a bit of sugar left over on the board.) Slice and arrange on baking sheets lined with parchment.   Bake the cookies for 6 minutes until caramelized and brown on the bottom, then turn with a spatula and bake another 3 to 5 minutes, until caramelized on the other side.

llkSmgLJaa	Haven't you ever cut your finger and put it in your mouth? That's what meat tasts like, raw meat anyway. This question is like asking is it ok to commit murder once. If your vegan for religious reasons please don't try meat.|`|6Gfz125Paa	You can eat whatever you want.  However, according to Hinduism, it is a sin.  I won't judge your religion, but I don't see why you would want to do something that your religion prohibits and that is bad for you anyway and that you are already successfully avoiding.|`|AA12334360	personally, i cannot see why you would even consider this is you are a vegetarian, why would you even be thinking that the cow in the field is food.    Should curiosity really triumph over morals ? I don't think is should|`|b9uOax0aaa	It is certainly ok with me.|`|b9wICW1Paa	Why would you want to do that in the first place?  Just to see what it tastes like?  If you taste and spit it out, then you have not prevented the slaughter, you have contributed to it.  You have also wasted something that may have given sustenance to another.      If you are a practicing Hindu, and you've never deliberately sampled meat in your life, then it seems there should be no reason for you to start now.  Are you questioning your beliefs?  Apparently you do not have a health issue you feel might be resolved by actually consuming meat, it seems that only curiousity or other pressures have gotten the better of you.     The real question, then, is this - what if you try it and decide you like it and want to have more, perhaps even eat meat regularly?  The same dilemna is potentially faced by many when deciding to try cigarettes or drugs for the first time.  Why try it in the first place when you know what very well may happen?|`|MbSSIOpSaa	If you have a strong desire to try meat, then do it. I am all about vegetarianism and veganism, but feeling trapped and as if you're living your life by a rule book is pointless. It should be something that you are excited about and feel good doing!

Swallow it, too.  Use the same repentance technique for eating meat as you do for getting angry.|`|wvsQ9SBcaa	Wouldn't that make you a hypocrite? Not "liberal". So it's okay to go to the store, buy the meat, cook the meat, cut into it, place it in your mouth, chew a couple of time then spit?? Yea.. hypocrite... and what a waste of money.

FxWppY7Baa	As far as the USDA is concerned only food that was grown on a certified organic farm can be marketed as organic see http://www.ams.usda.gov/nop for the complete 1500+ page regulation    What you are seeing are two vastly different ways to manage farms and how food is grown. One is conventional (not inorganic, whist you may know a bit about chemistry you know very little about farming) that allows the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers as well as GMO (genetically modified organisms, or crops and livestock that have DNA in their cells that has been spliced in and if often from another kingdom).    The other is organic that bans the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers but does allow pesticides made from plant based ingredients and fertilizers that have not been chemically processed (i.e. mined minerals) along with various composts, animals manures and green manures    Why do you pay more? because you opt to buy from a retail est that has to pay several middlemen. that and supply and demand. Buy local direct from the farmer and you will usually pay less for organic than what the grocery stores charge for conventional produce. And it will be far fresher (picked within 24 hours vs harvested 15 days ago)    So organic has two definitions, the chemical def and the farming (and USDA approved) def.|`|XHnpraaxaa	Not sure why you are trying to put someone down.  If you knew the answer there was no reason to put her on the spot.  She is a cashier and not paid to give out the info.  An no not all fruits or veggies are organic.|`|oojO4WAraa	No - a lot of fruits and veggies are spray with pesticides and fertilizers.  That is what makes the difference.  Organic products have not been sprayed.     Organic meat and chicken have not been feed grain that was grown with fertilizers or pesticides.|`|YX93lq4daa	All fruits and veggies are not organic. However, if you buy organic fruits and veggies, they would be indeed organic. They do not load the chemicals on during and after growing.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	Organic means no synthetic chemicals were used in growing or processing the foods.  Organic farmers may have to hand-pick bugs (such as potato beetles) instead of using pesticides (very labor-intensive), some of the produce may be discarded if it has been munched-on by bugs, so it costs much more to have healthier produce. One of the main health benefits of organic foods is less chemicals clogging up the liver and also more minerals by using compost as a fertilizer versus synthetic fertilizers.|`|SQxiGhz5aa	Yes, all fruits and vegetables are "organic" by definition.  BUT, in order to receive the "USDA Organic seal" they must be grown according to guidelines including, but not limited to, no chemical pesticide usage.    However, a grower can legally sell up to $5000.00 worth of "organic" products per year without said certification.    So yes, they are both organic material, and no (in most situations) they are not the same.    On a further note:  Not all Americans are dumb.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Obviously it's not the same; organic fruits and vegetables are grown small-scale without any pesticides or chemicals.    Organic eggs would come from chickens that haven't been given any growth hormones or anti-biotics.|`|1f944e23d84bc1ff43ee93ad66a40f2eaa	The chemical definition is carbon-containing.

wFw0SlJsaa	Well let us weigh our options.   If you were to choose the Ritz you might need some sort of dip, but the oreo comes with the creaminess already inside.  On the other hand you might want a glass of milk to go with the oreo which could be bothersome especially if you are lactose-intolerant.  Are you in the mood for sweet or salty? You might want to opt for the oreo because too much salt intake could make you retain water and feel bloated.  However, if you were planning on exercising a lot you would want to feel hydrated and salt would help that.  There are pros and cons to each option.  Considering it is this early in the morning, I would go for the oreo because the Ritz is more of a crunch for lunch.  I hope you make a good decision.

Ct0ESSbcaa	I have read something about that...here's an article that explains it. It basically says that when hot water is added to coffee, oils called terpenes are released, and that these have been known to raise blood cholesterol levels.

I don't see why one coffee prep method would be any better or worse than another.|`|avhgLEu8aa	I wouldn't have thought it would be any worse than any other type of coffee, I'm addicted to coffee so it's all good.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	No ... there's no cholesterol in ANY coffee; and the way you make/brew it doesn't matter.  The only cholesterol is in whatever creamer you put INTO the coffee|`|9IvcV7tiaa	no. it seems every other day there is some new study out saying one thing or another, and then later on another study comes out to contradict the previous one. about the only thing that makes coffee different in the way you prepare it is the amount of caffeine in it.|`|AA10471659	No cholesterol in coffee. But the press does release more oils and flavor in each cup.

Besides I have never heard of any plant oils being saturated fats
xLO5VRYTaa	It goes through a first filtration to get rid of anything large, alum is mixed and it forms flocs that cling to bacteria and impurities that settle at the bottom of a tank, then layers of sand, gravel, and hard coal filter any remaining impurites. Chlorine is added to prevent any growing bacteria and air is forced through the water to release any unwanted gases and it improves the taste. Yes it improves the taste of something tasteless... Some communities add fluoride and sodium or lime to soften water.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	Triple filtration... just like Smirnoff uses with their vodka.    ...this is beer wine and spirits forum. isn't it?|`|7nJnk2OGaa	Most communities use chlorine, chloramides, or flourides. There are other filters also to prevent any big chunks from getting to the smaller filters. We have a water softener and carbon filter system at our house. The softener gets rid of the hard water (calcium and magnesium) while the carbon filter gets rid of the cholrine taste.

Place pan in the oven to melt the butter and ice cream taking it out occasionally to mix the four ingredients butter the butter and ice cream is melted and most of the sugar has dissolved making a creamy carmel combine.       Combing 1/2C white sugar and cinnamon an a bowl. Coat the butter milk biscuits in cinnamon and sugar mixture.

Allow biscuits to cool for about five minutes. Next get a tray or platter that is slightly larger than the 9x13 glass pan. Place the tray upside down on top of the glass pan. Using oven mits quickly flip the pan up-side-down on to the tray. The biscuits should come out of the pan on to the tray coated in the carmel sauce!

Wash and dry the trout fillets and season lightly. Melt 25g/1oz of the  butter in a large frying pan and as soon as it starts to foam, add the  fillets, skin side down. Fry gently for 3 minutes, carefully flip over and  cook for a further 1 minute.  2. Using a fish slice, transfer the trout to heated plates and keep warm in  a low oven.  3. Add the remaining butter to the pan with the capers and dill and fry  until golden brown. Add lime juice to taste and a little salt and pepper. Spoon over the trout and serve.  4. Using a small pair of tweezers pull out any small bones that may still remain in the trout.     - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - --     Grilled Spiced Trout fillets        * 4 trout fillets, 125 g (4? oz) each      * For the marinade:      * 1 teaspoon tamarind concentrate or compressed pulp      * ?-1 teaspoon cayenne pepper      * 1 tablespoon chopped fresh coriander      * ? teaspoon ground coriander      * ? teaspoon ground cumin      * 2 teaspoons garlic pure, or crushed garlic      * Salt      * A little oil for greasing      * To garnish: fresh coriander; 1 lemon      * To serve: salad leaves and tomatoes    preparation method       1.   Put the fillets side by side in a single layer, skin side down, in a shallow non-corrosive dish.     2.   To make the marinade, blend the tamarind with 2 tablespoons of hot water in a bowl. If it does not dissolve, stand the bowl over a pan of simmering water and stir until it does. Allow it to cool.     3.   Add the cayenne pepper, chopped and ground coriander, cumin, garlic and salt to taste to the tamarind water, then pour it over the fish. Using the back of a spoon, spread the marinade so that it covers the fillets evenly and completely. Leave them to marinate for 30 minutes.     4.   Heat the grill to high. Line the grill pan with foil, then brush it with a little oil. Place the fish on the foil and grill for 5 minutes, or until the flesh flakes easily.     5.   Remove the fillets from the grill and garnish with a few sprigs of fresh coriander and the lemon, cut into wedges, and serve with mixed salad leaves and tomatoes.     6.   Tip: Tamarind, a sour tropical fruit, is sold in concentrated form in bottles and in compressed blocks of pulp in supermarkets and Asian food shops. If you do not have any tamarind, stir the spices into 1 tablespoon of lemon juice mixed with 1 tablespoon of water.|`|8g78x9VEaa	good recipes for Trout fillets  http://foods-recipe.synthasite.com/?q=re...  http://cooks-recipe.synthasite.com/?q=re...  http://desserts-recipe.synthasite.com/?q...|`|Ny79udz1aa	Since your trout fillets are almost certainly rainbow trout, they are not the tastiest.

Salt and pepper the skin sides and fry in the bacon fat until crisp.. If you can find them, put a few sage leaves under the fillets first. Turn and cook for a minute max on the other side. Serve.

If you want the least environmental impact, you not only have to consider the sustainability of the fish stocks but the food miles involved.

7oDIgqg9aa	If you want to make your own butter, get some heavy whipping cream.  Put it in the blender and whisk on high.  When it turns into whipped cream, keep whipping it.  It will turn into butter and liquid.    For popcorn you can use oil to pop the corn.  Any oil is fine, just enough to coat the bottom of the pan.  1 to 2 tablespoons.      If you were hopping to put butter on your popcorn, you can sprinkle your popcorn with parmesan cheese, while it's still hot, so the cheese sticks.    You can sprinkle pepper on it,  Any spice you like, basil, dill, chili powder.  The powder from a mac and cheese box.    Hope you like it!

432d817139a5e0be18e400a33e0e1908aa	Right, I can help with the first part. Pease Pudding is - basically - very thick yellow split pea soup, which is then baked. You may have to increase the amount of the peas.     BOILED HAM plus PEA & HAM SOUP    If you are going to boil a ham joint, why not make some pea & ham soup as well.     For 2 servings of soup     INGREDIENTS    1 ham joint   500ml of water  125g of peas   Ground black pepper to taste    METHOD     Rinse the ham in cold water, then soak the ham in cold water for at least 6 hours, changing the water once or twice if it is very salty, or according to any cooking instructions. If you are using dried peas, soak them in water according to the instructions.     Put the ham into a large saucepan and cover with fresh water. If you are using soaked dried peas, add them now. Bring to the boil, then turn down the heat until it is just boiling (simmering).     Put the lid on the saucepan and cook according to the cooking instructions on the ham. Remove any salty white scum, which will probably form on the surface of the water. Check the liquid level from time to time and top up if it starts to dry out.     Remove the ham. Adjust the quantity of the liquid to the required quantity of soup.     If you are using fresh, frozen or tinned peas, add them now. Continue cooking the peas until they are the desired consistency.     If you have a food processor, put the soup in it and blend it to the desired consistency. If you have a hand blender, put it in the soup and blend it to the desired consistency. If you dont have a food processor or hand blender, use a potato masher, press the soup through a sieve with the back of a spoon, or leave it lumpy.     Season with the pepper. Continue to cook for another couple of minutes.    ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    You can use dried, fresh, frozen or tinned peas. However, dried peas have to be soaked in advance.      Pea soup can be any consistency from a thin liquid with soft peas floating in it to a thick paste you can stand a spoon up in.

These potatoes are quick cookers. Don't peel potatoes as the vitamins are under the skin. If you cut up before boiling do not over boil these potatoes. You can of course bake them whole, if you do this in the oven and not the microwave, stick a spoon through the potato to conduct the heat into the centre of the spud.

Check regularly until it is brown and crispy, and turn over with a wee drop more oil and butter, and repeat until brown and lovel on the other side.

ypB3QDWNaa	Everything you said sounds proper.  When was the last time you had your lines blown out?  Large clobs of the wee-beasties that live inside of beer lines can cause disturbance in the flow of the beer, causing excess foaminess.  If its been a while, call your beer distributor and they will send a guy out to do it properly.  If they drag their heals, tell them to come and get their beer out of your place immediately because you are going to replace it with a competitors brand.    Also, your downflow PSI gauge may be faulty (not the PSI gauge for the tank).  Set your pressure lower and see if that helps.  First release the pressure inside the keg too: there is a spring-valve on the right-side of the keg-tap, pull it out and hold it open for 10 to 20 seconds.  Immediately test your taps and the flow of beer, then check it again in a minute or so.  Do this each time you reset or lower the pressure too.|`|7nJnk2OGaa	your beer lines are not long enough. you should have about 3 inches of beer line for every PSI you are pushing the beer out with.

While all meat animals have a brisket, the term is most often used to describe beef or veal. The beef brisket is one of the eight beef primal cuts. According to the Random House Dictionary of the English Language, Second Edition, the term derives from the Middle English "brusket" which comes from the earlier Old Norse "brjsk", meaning cartilage.

BAKED POTATO & KIDNEY    This recipe is a combination of cookery and keyhole surgery. If you are cooking this for someone else, dont tell them whats in the potato and call it Baked Potato Surprise.     Serves 1    INGREDIENTS    1 baking potato  1 lambs kidney  1 rasher of bacon  Butter  Ground pepper to taste.     METHOD    Prepare and start to bake the potato as you usually do.     Whilst the potato is cooking, remove all the tubes from the middle of the kidney (see below). Wrap it in the rasher of bacon.     About 20 to 30 minutes before the potato should be ready, remove it from the oven.     Make a star-shaped cut in the top of the potato, and open out the flaps. Dig a kidney-sized hole in the potato with a teaspoon. Put a little bit of butter in the bottom of the hole. Push in the bacon wrapped kidney. Season with the pepper. Bury the kidney with as much of the dug out potato as you can. Close the flaps.     Put the potato back in the oven and cook for a further 20 to 30 minutes until the kidney is cooked through.     ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS    Add a little bit of English mustard. Add a little bit of parsley.

Off the heat, add the corn syrup and vanilla and allow the chocolate mixture to cool to room temperature. In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the chocolate mixture and softened butter on medium speed for a few minutes, until it's thickened.  Spread the frosting evenly on the cake.    --Ina Garten|`|5Crovdoaaa	6 ounces semisweet chocolate (I use 6 squares baker's semisweet chocolate)   1/2 cup heavy cream   1 cup butter, cut into tablespoon sizes   2 1/2 cups confectioners' sugar, sifted     Directions  1 Place a large bowl, filled halfway with ice, in the sink (a bowl that is large enough to hold the pot that you will cook the frosting in).   2 In a medium size pot over medium low heat, melt chocolate, cream, and butter.   3 Stirring constantly, cook the mixture until all of the butter and chocolate melts and thickens.   4 Cook for 5-6 minutes.   5 DO NOT LET BOIL.   6 Remove pot from heat.   7 Whisk in the sifted confectioners' sugar until mixture becomes smooth (approximately 1 minute), then put the pot on top of the bowl of ice (be careful to not allow any ice from the larger bowl to get into pot with the chocolate mixture).   8 Beat with an electric mixer on low speed for 4-5 minutes until frosting becomes smooth, thick, and fudgy.   9 Remove from ice.   10 Spread onto cooled cake layers.   11 The frosting will thicken as it sets up.   12 If the frosting gets too hard to spread, put back on LOW heat and stir constantly until you get the spreading consistency desired.   13***I have been adding 1 Tbs. of light corn syrup to the initial heavy cream and chocolate mixture to add more glossiness to the frosting.***.

The king of all sauces, it is often referred to as a cream sauce because of its appearance and is probably used most frequently in all types of dishes. Made by stirring milk into a butter-flour roux, the thickness of the sauce depends on the proportion of flour and butter to milk. The proportions for a thin sauce would be 1 tablespoon each of butter and flour per 1 cup of milk; a medium sauce would use 2 tablespoons each of butter and flour; a thick sauce, 3 tablespoons each.    Velout is a stock-based white sauce. It can be made from chicken, veal or fish stock. Enrichment's such as egg yolks or cream are sometimes also added.    Espagnole, or brown sauce, is traditionally made of a rich meat stock, a mirepoix of browned vegetables (most often a mixture of diced onion, carrots and celery), a nicely browned roux, herbs and sometimes tomato paste.    Hollandaise and Mayonnaise are two sauces that are made with an emulsion of egg yolks and fat. Hollandaise is made with butter, egg yolks and lemon juice, usually in a double boiler to prevent overheating, and served warm. It is generally used to embellish vegetables, fish and egg dishes, such as the classic Eggs Benedict. Mayonnaise is a thick, creamy dressing that's an emulsion of vegetable oil, egg yolks, lemon juice or vinegar and seasonings. It is widely used as a spread, a dressing and as a sauce. It's also used as the base for such mixtures as Tartar Sauce, Thousand Island Dressing, A?oli, and Remoulade.    Vinaigrette is a sauce made of a simple blend of oil, vinegar, salt and pepper (usually 3 parts oil to 1 part vinegar). More elaborate variations can include any combination of spices, herbs, shallots, onions, mustard, etc. It is generally used to dress salad greens and other cold vegetable, meat or fish dishes.|`|8g78x9VEaa	gourmet cooking you can find:  http://foods-recipe.synthasite.com/?q=go...  http://cooks-recipe.synthasite.com/?q=go...  http://desserts-recipe.synthasite.com/?q...
xJBJn6dOaa	the bars I used to love in college always had themed nights. Tuesday was a buffalo wing-eating contest which was HUGE. Saturday during the day was a beer pong tournament (college-y, but still fun), and some random nights were 80's nights when all that played was 80's music and everyone was invited to dress up... all the bartenders had headbands and leotards and whatnot. Monday nights were trivia nights and the prize was $50 gift certificate to the bar (which was usually used that night). Thursday night was karaoke.|`|bBaPHQtPaa	Play pool, or some other game.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Drinking is fun.    Instead of trying to do something corny or silly, try to focus on the what the customer wants. Beer is a good start; they should offer more variety. More and more people like craft beer so they should offer at least one or two small brewery beers on tap... local is best.     Happy hour specials are appreciated, and having a longer happy hour with cheap drinks and food is a draw. Have a "wing night" and "burger night." Let customers order appetizers after the kitchen closes. Expand the menu if possible and offer specials.     Cocktail service is important ( don't make people wait at the bar for their drinks). Never serve beer in plastic cups. Provide good service too; get to know regulars.|`|AdIrjmV7aa	There are no new ideas.  Eerything has been tried. It's location, location, location.

0MZRc61raa	I've been vegan for 6 years.  Every once in a while, I screw up still and buy something with whey or milk in it.  You do the best you can.  It can be a lot of "research" at times, but you get to know what restaurants have food you can eat and what brands you can buy.      Don't be too hard on yourself.  If you want to eat up what you've already bought, then do that.  There's no shame in it.  Alternatively, you could donate unopened dry goods to a food pantry.  When I turned vegetarian, I ate up the last cans of tuna/package of chicken breasts.  Then I went vegan.  I'm sure I had a hunk of cheese or something that I needed to get rid of (and I'm sure I ate it).  It's a gradual process for some people.  Only you know how fast to go.    PETA's website has a listing of chain type restaurants.  Happy Cow has citywide listings for many countries.  Don't give up so soon.  It can be difficult at times, but you learn to plan your meals.  If you're ever "in a bind", most places can make you a salad, gas stations/convenience stores have nuts, dried fruit, fresh fruit, etc.    http://www.happycow.net/vegetarian_prote... - Happy Cow|`|ZhiYghZ1aa	http://www.veganeatingout.com/restaurant...    here is a website i always use that says what things are vegan at common restaurants.    stick in there it gets easier.|`|b9uOax0aaa	It is your life and you are the only one who can make that determination.  I say eat up what you have and take the time to rethink your decisions.|`|29maScwJaa	I'd suggest not being a vegan. I tried it, and couldn't do it, but I've easily been vegetarian for like...6 or 7 years now approximately. I feel that being vegetarian is enough, for now. I mean think about how many lives you are already saving just by being vegetarian. Being vegan is more of an inconvenience on yourself than anything, I know it's a selfless act but we already do so much by being vegetarian. Don't worry about being vegan, it's really hard, it's a lot of stress and work and you'e doing more than enough already by being vegetarian. Or go partially like what I do. I drink soya milk and eat soya cheese and the whole works, and I avoid any animal ingredients, like pepsin, gelatin, etc. The only time I will eat real cheese is if I am at a restaraunt and they do not offer it. But still then, I make sure it does not have animal products in it. When I am out, I try my best to avoid animal biproducts too but honestly on a tight budget and lack of places, it's almost impossible. So thats an option, that if you want to help the cause even more, don't stress yourself over it, thats no way to live! Feel healthy and help the cause, stay vegetarian, and avoid biproducts as much as you can but if you sometimes can't, don't let it upset you. We do a lot already, keep that in your mind! :D|`|e598a4a2cc577e31e93cb794b800a568aa	hey do not throw it away, give or donate to shelter or church, salvation army, there are plenty of floks on the hurt right now so donation is good.    and be patient, the good change you have taken on is the right thing to do, just as we all know change does not happen over night.    thank you for trying to eat a plant-based diet!

KellyWA (11:36:48) : DESSERT PIZZA SHELLS    1/2 oz Active dry yeast  2 tb Nonfat dry milk powder  1 c Very warm (120-125'F) water  1 tb Sugar or honey  1/2 c Apple juice  1 ts Salt  5 c Flour  1/2 c Lukewarm water (or more)    Dissolve the yeast and the skim milk powder in the  water. Add the sugar or honey and stir well to  dissolve. Let this sit for  about 10 minutes. Add the apple juice and combine  well.    Put all of the flour in a large mixing bowl. Add the  salt and combine. Add the liquid mixture to the flour  along with enough additional water to make a soft but  not  sticky dough. Knead the dough for 4  minutes if using a stand mixer; 8 minutes if kneading  by hand. Divide the dough into balls  of about 4 ounces each, put them on a floured sheet  pan, cover the pan and allow to rise  for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until doubled in bulk (or let  rise, covered well, in the refrigerator overnight).    Thickness: To make a dessert pizza shell, the dough  should be rolled thicker than that for  a thin-crust pizza because it will be holding more  weight. Go with a dough shell that is at  least 1/8-inch thick.    Forming: Pull up the sides to form a crust cuff or a  well to hold the dessert toppings. The  pizza shell should like like a pie or tart shell.    Size: A four- or five-inch diameter pizza seems to  be the best size, because it can be  served as an individual dessert or as one for two  people to share.    Preparation: The best way to go from this point is to  dock the crust and bake it completely. This baked  crust will then be ready to  take various toppings. In a few  situations you might want to only par-bake the crust  -- when doing a baked apple pizza,  for example.    Toppings:  Cheeses: For the sake of simplicity and good taste,  cheeses can be narrowed down to three: ricotta,  mascarpone and cream cheese.  Fruits: Just about any fruit will work. Using fresh  fruit  will control the moisture.  Nuts: Walnuts, pecans, almonds, and pine nuts are  favorites.  Miscellaneous: Spices such as cinnamon, nutmeg  and cloves work well. Crushed or ground amaretto  cookies make a great  topping over cheese and fruit. Chocolate chips,  raisins and zest of oranges,  lemons or limes can be used most effectively to  pump up the flavor. A dusting of confectioners' sugar  looks good  and goes a long way in the taste department.  Brushing or layering fruit  preserves or a fruit glaze on the crust before toppings  go on adds a  lot of flavor and offers a wide range of taste  possibilities.

95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	There's obviously no exact date, as the cheesecake probably evolved from various cheese-based tarts and cakes over hundreds of years.     Here is a brief history:    Cato the Elder's De Agri Cultura includes recipes for two cakes for religious uses: libum and placenta. Of the two placenta is most like modern cheesecakes having a crust that is separately prepared and baked. (This would be around 200 BC)    Records of the Countess of Leicester mention "cheese for tarts" in 1265; the earliest English recipe is found in the Forme of Cury (14th century).|`|zn0pXkc0aa	Try reading this link:    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheesecake
c02d130371aff0c619f3ef4c7f7cf16baa	I have a passion for cooking and baking for over 30 years now.  So yes, I have entered and won contests before, but this is my ALL TIME FAVORITE!    I have a REALLY REALLY good recipe for Chili!   The Chef at our Country Club was looking for a homemade recipe for Chili so he decided to have a Chili contest which all members were invited to partake.     So I entered in this blind taste cook-off against 15 other people, including my husband, 10 years ago. We were still in our late 30's-early 40's then.  It was funny because when the Chef called to remind us, he thought my husband and I were entering together, and when I told him "OH NO WE ARE NOT" he started laughing and said "this will be interesting".    So those of us who entered were to make our Chili at home and bring it to the kitchen at the Club in order for nobody to be able to see who walked in with whatever pot. They numbered the pots 1-15 and took the pots upstairs to the "Chili Cookoff Tasting Room".  They had 5 tables which they put 3 pots of Chili on each one with small cups and spoons.  The Chef introduced us all before the tasting begain, and when he said that my husband and I had entered separately the "ahhs" were heard.  About 50 members came, tasted and voted (pieces of paper were provided w/pencils, all got 1 vote- along with the Chef &G.M., put their favorite "Chili  " and drop it in a box.  It was so much fun.  Having cocktails together and watching people taste the "Chilis".  Finally when all had voted the Chef & G.M. took the box of votes away to be counted.    There were 3 statues for 1st, 2nd & 3rd place.  I don't know how much time passed before the two came back, but it was exciting anyway.  They walked in, gave a little "speel" and then announced the winners.  3rd place went to an older Man, 2nd place went to my husband and     I WON 1st PLACE!  So I go up to get my trophy and the Chef announced that my Chili had 2/3rds of the votes and that he had decided to place my Chili on the Club's Lunch & Dinner Menu!  It is still on there today!   Ever since then so many people ask that I make it for them, their families or for parties which I happily oblige.    NOTE:  My husband was and still is devistated!  (He is a good cook.)  Not only because my trophy was bigger than his, and that I beat him because he always claimed to make the best Chilli, every time he opens whatever the menu may be there is my Chili listed 3 different times (it is named with my first and last name's Chili) and people that don't even know me will come up to us and introduce themselves and say to me "how fabulous my Chili is", "Reminds me of my Mom's Chili", "If they ever take your Chili off of the menu will you give (sometimes they offer to pay) me your recipe", etc.  It's really even become a running joke around the Club for people to say/bring it up to my husband even to this day!  And what is so sad is he is still _______ off about it!     Thanks for making laugh, bringing back a happy memory and sharing my story with you.  By the way.........Our trophies are next to each other on the bookshelf in our living area much to his dismay!|`|fvUAYU7xaa	Nope x|`|aMzSCLLIaa	no|`|XHnpraaxaa	No since I was the youngest one in the pie baking contest and my first try.|`|vai4ZnXsaa	Nope i havent.

Red beans and rice is a cheap and easy recipe. I don't even buy the veggies to put in it (peppers, onions, tomatoes) I just buy the cheapest jar of salsa I can find. Substituting with beans in general is a great way to go. They are super cheap and often on sale. I buy them in large quantities.   Perhaps the best way I have found to save money is to turn my leftover meats into soup. Meat, broth and a bag of frozen mixed veggies is an instant soup in my house and is always eaten up quickly and if not is easily frozen.

It is really good and I have shared this recipe with a few families with kids and they like it too.|`|AFMo3671aa	Well, first don't buy ready made food.   If you have a freezer, cook in big quantities using vegetables you can  find cheap.  and freeze them in small portions so you have always some vegetables ready and you have only to cook them once. You can also prepare your spaghetti bolognaise sauces in big quantity and freeze them when you find some cheap meat in the shop.  If you like  pasta, here is an easy and cheap recipe  You take one or two onions (depends how many you are - in  your case it would be two) - you fry them in a little olive oil or any fat  you like. When they are nearly fried you add a can of tuna fish. Once the tuna fish is warm (it has not to be fried like the onions), you add some cream or skimmed milk and let the whole thing simmer a while.  To  this sauce you can add a tin  of peas or some spinach. This is a good variation  for the usual spaghettis.  You can  also make "boulettes", I  don't know the  name in  english as I am French. This is made with mince meat, you add an egg and bread, for this you can also use dried out bread if you have some, anyhow, the bread has to be moistened with water or milk and then you mix everything together. You can put any spices or  herbs  you like if there are no spices in the meat you buy. you form nice little balls and fry them. You also can eat them cold with mustard the next day.  You can also make mashed potatoes, spinach and eggs.  In Belgium there is a meal  called "stoemp", it is mashed potatoes mixed with carrots or leak, then you add fried onions and bacon. a little  cream or skimmed milk, salt and pepper.    Bon apptit.|`|qZaOvstaaa	This is a great site for cheap easy meals with lots of recipes:    http://www.hillbillyhousewife.com/index1...    I have made several items and they turn out well.

AA11173395	Pros:  Environmental - The raising of animals for food is the number one cause of global warming.

BhFeii5Xaa	Hi baby doll!! you can bake your bread on or in anything you want to put it on. Shape the loaf into a round or log shape as you desire. Bread braids are always most interesting. Bread will hold its shape if it is mixed according to instructions and kneaded correctly.    http://www.recipezaar.com has lots of lovely bread recipes and explicit instructions on how to do it.    I do recommend for your first loaf to do plain white bread. Reason is that is the easiest to deal with. But you can substitute up to 3/4 of any white flour for any other flours you may want to use in your bread.    Do not try to "knead" the bread with a mixer or any other kitchen appliance. Use a bread board on the table so you can get the experience of how to do the kneading correctly.    This is such a personal learning tool. Please enjoy the experience! I use bread making as a "stress reducer"! I take all my frustrations out on the dough.|`|XHnpraaxaa	The easy way out is to buy a bread maker.  I have never owned one and have made fresh bread for years.  You would need a pan if you wanted to make it from scratch.  There is many good recipes around.  Just check a good cookbook.  Always make sure the water for the yeast is right and this will be a good beginning for you.|`|yB8djbeNaa	the best advise i can give is buy a bread maker its so much easier and well worth the money... they come with recipes in and you can even make jams and cakes in some of them.|`|DSg4fgnEaa	My problem was and still is the bread coming out too heavy.  Try lightly spooning the flour into the measuring cup.  Use little or no salt.  Make sure you keep your oven moist and coat the top of your bread so it remains soft or crisp depending how you want it.  But bread being too thick or heavy is the biggest problem for beginners.
EITcvAf2aa	One of my grandsons love broccoli and eats a ton of it, and most veggies and fruit.    the other two we have a very hard time with, but they will eat corn and green beans.     My DIL has started buying the V-8 splash drinks that have a serving of fruit and veggies in every glass. they don't even know they're drinking their veggies and love the stuff.    Most little ones will eat raw veggies with some ranch dip though, I have found. Mushrooms, carrots, celery, cucumbers, that sort of thing.|`|b9uOax0aaa	Whatever veges the wife cooked.  We put them on the table and the kids were expected to eat them and they did|`|MbSSIOpSaa	I don't have kids, but you could try putting peas in mac and cheese. Or smoothies are good and kids like those (I know that's fruit though). You could make fried rice with pieces of broccoli, peas, carrots, etc. and put a yummy sauce on and some tofu, maybe they'd eat that.|`|JGOeJOFDaa	Do you try veggies and ranch or another dip of some kind? My kids love that.  Also, maybe give them some V8 juice to supplement their diet.  V8 now makes V8 Fusion which tastes like fruit and has 1 serving of fruit and 1 serving of veggies in a glass.  I use it all the time!|`|a18866a5fa9b1011516eec55c6df35e4aa	Well whenever i was a picky kid, i really liked canned peas, beans, broccoli, and cauliflower. My mum disguised them well in dishes. :)|`|GBpaTTy2aa	most kids like carrots and broccoli (but only with cheese sauce). if all else fails, there is a vitamin that provides all of the needed veggie servings per day. Go to you nearest vitamin store and they can tell you what kind of a selection they have. There is one called "garder vegetables" by i think nature's way. That one is only 5-6 bucks per bottle and works great.|`|wFw0SlJsaa	Just put them in stuff they like, like casseroles (chicken and rice, tuna, etc...), soups, mac 'n cheese.  Have Tacos or burgers and set out a whole bunch of toppers like lettuce, tomatoes, onions, olives, peppers etc..and it might tempt them to see all the colors.  V8 V-fusion tastes like fruit juice with a whole serving of veggies.  You can add grated carrots or zucchini to muffins, breads, and cookies.  If you do a bunch of little things like these, it will add up.|`|sgvhVyz1aa	My sister has a policy with her two boys that if there is something new on the table that they have to try at least one bite - she calls it a "no thank you bite"  which means that they have to try it, but not necessarily eat a whole portion.  It seems to help.  Also, parents need to eat veggies and maybe telling your kids how delicious this or that one tastes would help win then over.   My mom used to make all kinds of different vegetables for us to try; she used to tell my little brother that broccoli was trees and cauliflower was flowers.   If you're serving raw vegetables, think about the presentation - make them look pretty or different to peak the kids interest.  Most kids will tend to gravitate to what their body needs, this can take some time and test patience on the parents part.  Good Luck.

NeTNnvSZaa	Because sometimes you want to roast a whole chicken.  I prefer to do mine stuffed sometimes and you can't really do that with a precooked or pieced up bird.

The ones you buy don't have much seasoning on them; and some people need to watch their sodium intake.  Also, you can stuff whole chickens ...  If you buy one at the store, you aren't sure how long ago it was cooked; and it has to be reheated for dinner.  When you make it yourself, it's always freshly roasted.  ... Also, you can put whole ones on your BBQ rotisserie    I don't understand why so many people rely on grocery stores or prepackaged products to make their meals.  Why can't people learn how to cook, and do it themselves?|`|zn0pXkc0aa	I like to buy a whole chicken as I can get more bang for my cluck.    Here's a run down of how to use a whole chicken.    Option 1:  Roast chicken. Serve with taters, stuffing, veggies, etc.  Strip chicken of meat and use to make sandwiches or casseroles. Use carcass to make broth.    Option 2:  Fry chicken. Use chicken for dinner followed by lunch he next day. Use carcass to make broth.    Either option gives me a free meal of broth which I can use to make all kinds of soups from.    Also, whole chickens tend to be cheaper than chicken pieces.|`|pnrhpAfbaa	some people don't care about the cost so a dollar more it doesn't really matter|`|NPtz1Y4Taa	because their lazy and have no imagination of their own lol|`|AA10928232	When I do, it's to roast it whole.  My family loves my whole roasted chicken even more than a store-bought rotisserie chicken.  And I usually do buy them whole when on sale.    Sometimes I want all the pieces of a chicken, so I cut it up myself.  This is cheaper than buying a "whole chicken, cut-up."  Plus, I get the livers/gizzards to cook for my puppy dog.    I like the carcass that is left over to make homemade stock for the freezer.|`|fZnuyKSZaa	Because a whole chicken tastes different than just the legs or the wings or the breast. Like a whole Turkey tastes different than the sliced up , prepacked sandwich fillers.  And precooked... you know.. I like to cook and want to experiment with different flavours. Food is not only calories, fat protein and carbs.. Food is pleasure..a social ingredient. Something which can hold a family together|`|6WyFaKRAaa	Because whole chickens retain more flavour and can also be stuffed. Leftovers can be made into chicken and mushroom pie or chicken and lentil soup (known in our house as skeleton stew) and then I make stock out of the carcass So in the long run turns out cheaper|`|mP6ox5f3aa	Obviously an American asking this one. It is cheaper to buy a whole chicken than one that has been processed, ie. carved and packed.    Bone a fresh chicken and boil the bones or frame, for stock, ie. in a pressure cooker for 15 mins. and then add an onion and corn from the cob.That is your soup. Slice the breast off and remove the legs and wings. you have four more meals there. Dont waste anything.  I know Americans well.|`|53giV6PFaa	I agree with the others.  I disagree with you on the cost of a cut up chicken - it is usually more than a whole one.  You can buy a whole pre-cut chicken for about $6-7 per package versus a whole chicken is about $4-$5 in the stores I shop in.  I just cut up my own chicken when I need to cook it.  I usually buy several on the weekend and cut them up and freeze them to be used later on.  I also use it to boil chicken for dishes such as casseroles and salads - you get both a nice mixture of dark and white meat.  I also use the carcarss for stocks for soups.  So a whole chicken goes alot further and more cost effective.    I do not buy the rotisserie chicken at the store - way too salty and dried meat, because you never know how long it's been sitting under a heat lamp which is why I roast my own.      The only cut up chicken I buy will be a package of drumsticks or wings and boneless chicken breasts whenever on sale other than that I usually use whole chickens.|`|AA11689643	because I like to season my chicken to my taste and at the grocery store you can't do that!|`|AA11293493	i always buy a whole chicken at the shops. in the UK it works out better as i can get maybe 4 meals (for me and my boyfriend) for a 5.50 chicken when if i wanted to buy the bits separately (especially breast meat) it would cost me about 2.00 for the chicken in each meal.    I always but free range chickens as i don't approve of mass farmed hormone filled birds, and i tend to joint it up myself so i can get:    Breasts - curry. fajitas, salads (2 meals)  Legs - jerked, roasted, etc  Wings - jerked with the legs, fried or put into the stock  Carcase - Boiled up and made into stock for soups sauces or reduced and frozen like mini stock cubes.    Or indeed a whole stuffed and roasted chicken.    You see some people like to put effort onto their food and like to know how it was treated prior to eating (including when it was alive) i am not saying that it is wrong to get a pre roasted chicken from the market, cos sometimes convenience wins out. However i cant understand why people would want to eat a chicken that has been "grown" in a dark shed at twice the normal speed, killed and plucked and then mass roasted? where is the fun in that?|`|o0Atf76taa	Cmon Joe, you know the reason why.  Its because the buyers think the chicken tastes, looks, smells better cooked whole, at home.  Whether theyre right or not is a matter of opinion.  When I cook whole chickens, I like to cover the outside in olive oil and spices, and on the inside I like to put numerous garlic cloves and wedges of lemon.  After the bird is finished roasting, the meat is filled with the flavors of the lemon and garlic, and I can use the cooked garlic cloves to spread on French bread, or just throw them away.    People buy whole chickens for the same reasons they grow their own tomatoes.  Sure, you could go to the farmers market and get the same quality, cheaper, but nothing beats the sense of satisfaction of making something yourself.|`|hKlsJgVSaa	So they can roast it themselves and control the spics, flavors and extra.    And usually a whole chicken IS cheaper. Not to mention that you can use the back and  other scraps for broth.

AA11105452	wow, I can't believe there's so many people in a VEGETARIAN/VEGAN board saying how wrong it is to not eat animal products during the Super Bowl...

pOaS9P38aa	Starch gelatinization is a process that breaks down the intermolecular bonds of starch molecules in the presence of water and heat, allowing the hydrogen bonding siteso engage more water.    Gelatinization is also known as the thickening of a liquid. Water and heat are needed for the process to take place. The starch grains/flour granules absorb the liquid. When heated the grains/granules swell and then burst, releasing starch into the liquid. The granules/grains swell to 5times their original size

The starter doesnt actually involve any cooking and can be made in advance. The main course does have to be cooked at the time, but you can prepare some of the ingredients in advance, it doesnt take long and it allows you to show off your culinary skills. The dessert can be "taken elsewhere", if you know what I mean, postponed or even dispensed with completely.     For a wine, I recommend a Soave, or a good quality Pinot Grigio.     The starter is a simple Mozzarella cheese and tomato salad. The original recipe uses a sliced sweet Spanish onion as well but, under the circumstances, Ive left this out. You can make this in advance, cover it with cling film and keep it in the fridge.    MOZZARELLA & TOMATO SALAD   (INSALATA DELLA MOZZARELLA)    Serves 2    INGREDIENTS    100g packet of Mozzarella cheese  1 large beef tomato  1 small bunch of fresh basil  2 tablespoons of olive oil  Ground pepper to taste    METHOD    Open the pack of cheese and drain off the liquid. Wash the tomato. Wash and chop the basil.     Cut the cheese into an equal number of slices. Cut off the top and bottom off of the tomato, and then cut it into an equal number of slices.     Arrange the cheese and tomato on two small plates, overlapping the slices. Sprinkle on some of the chopped basil. Dribble on the olive oil. Season with the pepper.     ADDITIONS & ALTERNATIVES    Add some stoned olives. Ideally, you should use extra virgin olive oil for salads. However, if you only have the normal stuff, you can use that instead.     Serve with ciabatta or focaccia bread.     The main course is one of my favourites, tagliatelle with smoked salmon in a cream sauce. I dont know of any other dish, which gives such a luxurious result yet only uses so few simple ingredients.       TAGLIATELLE WITH SMOKED SALMON IN A CREAM SAUCE  (TAGLIATELLE AL SALMONE AFFUMICATO )    Serves 2     INGREDIENTS     125g pack of smoked salmon (save a sheet for later  see below)  2 cloves of garlic  1 onion  1 tablespoon of olive oil  1 tablespoon of flour  150ml carton of single cream  1 teaspoon of mixed herbs (or some more of the basil from the salad)  At least 300ml of water    ? of a teaspoon of salt  200g of tagliatelle (see below)  Ground pepper to taste    METHOD    Cut the smoked salmon into 2cm (1 inch) pieces. Peel the garlic and chop it into tiny pieces. Peel the onion and chop it into tiny pieces.     Put the oil into a frying pan on a medium heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook for a couple of minutes until the onion has gone soft. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. Add the flour and stir until it has absorbed the oil and juices in the pan. Add the cream, herbs and smoked salmon. Stir and cook for about a minute until it has made a smooth sauce.     Put the water and salt into a saucepan on a medium heat. Bring to the boil. Add the pasta. Stir it to stop it sticking to the bottom of the pan. Bring back to the boil and continue to cook. Stir frequently to stop it sticking. (Memorise and use this phrase: Gli spaghetti amano la compagnia, which is Italian for spaghetti loves company.)     Begin testing it about 2 minutes before the packet instructions say it should be done. The best way to judge if pasta is cooked is to bite it. This is tricky, because if you fish out a bit and stick in your mouth you may burn your mouth on the boiling water. Wait a bit and blow on it, then bite it. If it is hard it needs longer. If it is chewy (or al dente, Italian for to the teeth) it is ready. If it is soft it is overcooked.      Drain the pasta in a sieve or colander.     Put the pasta in the pan with the sauce and stir together until thoroughly coated. (Explain to your partner that this is because an Italian would always bring the pasta to the sauce, not just plonk a dollop of sauce on top of the pasta. At this point, your status as a domestic god should be pretty well guaranteed.)    Season with the pepper. Sprinkle on a little more of the chopped fresh basil.     ADDITIONS & ALTERATIONS    Use crme fra?che instead of the cream.     The half cream, half green mixed tagliatelle (called paglia e fieno, or straw and hay) looks really good with this sauce. (It also gives you yet another Italian phrase to drop into the conversation.)    Serve with some more ciabatta or focaccia bread.     TIPS    If you use enough water, add the pasta when the water is boiling, stir the pasta frequently and dont wander off (Remember, Gli spaghetti amano la compagnia, or spaghetti loves company) and dont overcook it, adding olive oil to the water to stop it sticking is totally unnecessary.     The dessert is just three scoops of good quality ice cream, one each of strawberry, vanilla  and mint. It can be taken elsewhere, if you know what I mean. If your partner has eaten enough, this course can be left for later or even dispensed with in a suitably nonchalant manner.|`|AA11737190	Fondue is fun!!    http://www.recipegoldmine.com/fondue/fon...|`|EITcvAf2aa	Can never go wrong with seafood, or steak, potatoes and salad with some kind of good bread for a man.

Ingredients:    2 tbsp. butter    2 cloves garlic, finely minced    a dash pepper    a dash salt    a pinch of dried dill weed or parsley    a dash paprika    4 tilapia fillets    Instructions:    1) In a saucepan, combine butter, garlic, pepper, salt, dill weed, and paprika. Heat over low heat until butter is melted and starts simmering. Remove from heat.    2) Brush a little of the butter mixture in the bottom of a shallow baking dish (line baking dish with foil, if desired) then place tilapia fillets on the buttered area.    3) Brush top of each tilapia fillet with the seasoned butter mixture.    4) Bake at 350 for 12 to 15 minutes, until tilapia flakes easily with a fork.    5) Serve with Jasmine rice and/or buttered asparagus for added appeal.    I found more recipes at the link below.  Good luck!
XHnpraaxaa	Are not the ingredients on the package?|`|jaAolejUaa	The chewing gum is made of a "gum base" with added flavoring and sometimes food coloring . The exact composition of gum bases is usually a trade secret, but common ingredients can be latexes (eg. leche, caspi, sorva, nispero, tunu, jelutong, or chicle, which is still commercially produced), paraffin wax or beeswax, polyethylene, polyvinyl acetate, stearic acid, and various natural gums.       Old gum bases were based on latexes, vegetable gums like chicle, spruce gum, or mastic gum. Alternative choices were waxes, eg. paraffin wax and beeswax. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana and at Wm. Wrigley Jr. Company are studying the possibility of making gum base with biodegradable zein (corn protein).       The approximate manufacturing methods are fairly constant between brands. The gum base is melted at a temperature of about 115 ?C (240 ?F), until it has the viscosity of thick maple syrup, and filtered through a fine mesh screen. Then it is further refined by separating dissolved particulars in a centrifuge, and further filtered. Clear base, still hot and melted, is then put into mixing vats. Other ingredients that may be added include: powdered sugar, whose amount and grain size determines the brittleness of the result, corn syrup and/or glucose which serve as humectants, coat the sugar particles and stabilize their suspension, and keep the gum flexible, various softeners, food colorings, flavorings, preservatives and other additives.       The homogenized mixture is then poured onto cooling belts, and cooled with cold air. Extrusion, optionally rolling and cutting, and other mechanical shaping operations follow. The chunks of gum are then put aside to set for 24 to 48 hours.       Coated chewing gums then undergo other operations. The chunks are wrapped with optional undercoating for better binding with outer layers then immersed into liquid sugar. The pellets are then colored and coated with a suitable glazing agent, usually a wax.       Non-coated varieties are covered in sweetened marble dust to prevent the wrapper from sticking to the product.         Since chewing gum is classified as a food product, it must meet the strict standards of the United States Food and Drug Administration.|`|47R03TbFaa	GO ONLINE TO GOOGLE AND TYPE IN CHEWING GUM.MADE OF AND YOU CAN GET MORE INFO THAN WHAT I CAN GIVE YOU IT WILL ALSO TELL YOU HOW ITS MADE WHAT ITS MADE FROM AND THE HISTORY OF CHEWING GUM also write the gum companies they can sometimes send free samples gum etc.

If you would like more people to come, tells the RSVP'd guests to bring a friend or a guest with them, or even start inviting people by word of mouth as well. (Just make sure you keep a count on the number of RSVP's)  All in all, it will also depend what you are going to be doing for your party and who is coming to your party.  If the people coming are fun and lively you'll have a great time... I wouldn't worry about it.

CvYq5wBhaa	This is a fantastic Martha Stewart recipe for Anise Drops--the cookies are slightly crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The recipe calls for a pastry bag, but if you're not concerned with the cookies looking picture perfect, you can scoop the dough into a Ziploc bag, cut off one of the bottom corners, and pipe the dough from the bag.    1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour   1/2 teaspoon baking powder   1/2 teaspoon coarse salt   3 large eggs   1 1/4 cups sugar   1 teaspoon anise extract       Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Sift together flour, baking powder, and salt into a medium bowl; set aside.     Put eggs in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. Mix on medium speed until eggs are fluffy, about 3 minutes.   Gradually beat in the sugar until incorporated, about 3 minutes. Mix in anise extract.     Reduce speed to low; mix in flour mixture. Transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a coupler or a 1/2-inch plain tip (such as an Ateco No. 806). Pipe 1 3/4-inch rounds onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper, spacing 1/2 inch apart.     Bake cookies, rotating sheets halfway through, until tops crack and cookies are very pale, 8 to 9 minutes. Transfer to wire racks using a spatula; let cool. Cookies can be stored in airtight containers at room temperature up to 3 days.|`|jaAolejUaa	http://www.cooks.com/rec/search/0,1-00,a...  http://www.cdkitchen.com/recipes/cat/865...  http://recipe.aol.com/recipe/anise-cooki...  http://recipes.lovetoknow.com/wiki/Anise...  http://www.cookingcache.com/dessert/anis...|`|x2cXYousaa	ANISE COOKIES       COOKIES:    4 eggs  2 c. sugar  6 c. flour  1 c. milk  3/4 c.

fZnuyKSZaa	Apple pie  .   Serves 6  225g flour   115g unsalted butter, chilled and diced  or half butter, half cokeen  Salt   1.5kg cooking apples such as bramley   115g granulated sugar, plus 1 tbsp for sprinkling   a bit of cinnamon     To make the pastry, place the flour with the butter and a pinch of salt in a food processor. Blend until the mixture forms fine breadcrumbs. Tip into a bowl and mix in 3-4 tbsp cold water. Lightly knead the mixture into a dough, wrap in foil and chill for 30 minutes.   Heat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas Mark 6. Peel, quarter and core the apples. Roughly chop and tip into a largish pie dish. Mix in 115g sugar, 3 tbsp water and the cinnamon  On a lightly floured surface, roll out the pastry into roughly the same shape as your pie dish only larger. Cut a ribbon from the edge of the pastry and press it firmly onto the rim of the pie dish    Loosely roll the pastry onto a rolling pin and lift onto the pie dish.

Place pie on a cookie sheet so the drippings don't drop into your oven.  6.  Cover edges of pie with aluminum foil.  7.  Bake in a preheated 375F oven for 25 minutes. Then remove foil and put back in for another 25 to 30 minutes without foil.  8.  Remove from oven. Sprinkle pie with chopped pecans then drizzle with caramel on top.  9.  Cool on a wire rack and enjoy warm or at room temperature.    --Recipe courtesy of Marsha Brooks, Emeril's Apple Pie Contest winner, GMA 2001|`|AA11870216	GET 12 DOSENS EGGS, MIX THEM IN A BOWL, MIX THE **** OUT OF THEM, AND THERE YOU HAVE IT!|`|hKlsJgVSaa	Pie Crust:  3 cups flour      2-3 tbsp sugar      1 tsp salt               1 heaping cut veggie shortening well chiiled                                                                                       1 cup ice cold water    Mix the flour, salt and sugar. Cut in the shortening until pea sized, slowy add the water a dribble at a a time until pulls together.The add just a sprinkle more.  Wrap in seran wrap and put in the fridge at least 1 hour, or overnight.      I do my apples differently than most people but it makes a unique filling.    I peel a bunch of apples. All different kidns, just depeninding on what is a good deal and looks good at the store.  Iwould say 6-8 apples.    Then I use about 1/3 (the not quite so cruchy ones) of those apples and put then in a pan with some water or apple juice. Then in small bowl I mix flour, cinnamon, and sugar. And sprinkle that on to the apples. It needs to be gooey and lots of goo.    Then add the gooey apple to the plain ones in a large bowl. his makes an apple filling and you still have crunchy apples as well.    Let the cool to at least room temp, and then roll out the pie crust and top with the second. Crimp the edges and cut vent holes in. I usually brush on an egg wash but you coud use milk, and then a sprinkle of sugar.    Now here are my tips for getting a perfect crust:    If you have a clear glass pie dish use that it is the best. I'll tell you why later.    Cover the whole to pie foil for about the first 1/2 of the baking time. Look at the bottom of the pie pan. If you can see the bottom crust starting to brown then it is time to take the top foil off. If it is not yet turning brown then leave the foil on longer.    * If you don't have a clear pie pan then just go a little longer than half way or try to peek by usuing a butter knife and gently pulling the crust away from the edge, it doesn't always work but sometimes does.    Ater the bottom starts to turn brown the unver the top of the pie and bake until the top os golden brown.    This helps to prevent a soggy slimy bottom crust. You may need to re-wrap just the edges of the pie if they are getting to dark and the middle is still pasty white, so keep the foil ready.|`|jaAolejUaa	http://www.dltk-teach.com/alphabuddies/r...  http://allrecipes.com/Recipes/Desserts/P...  http://pies-cookies-squares.suite101.com...  http://www.myhomecooking.net/apple-pie/  http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/databa...  http://www.cookingnook.com/best-apple-pi...  http://www.texascooking.com/recipes/gran...  http://www.dltk-kids.com/recipesdb/view....|`|fvUAYU7xaa	Preparation time less than 30 mins  Cooking time 10 to 30 mins    Ingredients  For the pastry:  255g/9oz plain flour  pinch of salt  140g/5oz hard margarine or butter  6 tsp cold water  For the filling:  3 large Bramley cooking apples, chopped, stewed and cooled  sugar, to taste  caster sugar, to serve    Method  1. Preheat the oven to 200C/400F/Gas 6.  2. Sieve the flour and salt into a bowl.  3. Rub in the margarine or butter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.  4. Add the cold water to the flour mixture. Using a knife, mix the water into the flour, using your hand to firm up the mixture. The pastry should be of an even colour and suitable consistency for rolling.  5. Divide the pastry into two halves. Take one half and roll it out so that it is big enough to cover an 20cm/8in enamel or aluminium plate. Trim the edges with a knife using the edge of the plate as your guide.  6. Cover the pastry with the stewed apples and sprinkle with sugar to taste.  7. Roll out the other half of the pastry. Moisten the edge of the bottom layer of pastry and place the second piece on top.   8. Press down on the pastry edges, making sure that they are properly sealed. Trim off any excess pastry with a knife in a downward motion, again using the plate as your guide.   9. Flute the edges with a pinching action using your fingers and thumb.  10. Prick the surface of the pastry lightly before placing the pie in the oven. Cook for 20-30 minutes.  11. When the pie is cooked it should move slightly on the plate when gently shaken.  12. Slide on to a serving plate, dust with caster sugar and serve.

Same for a turkey too. :o)|`|1CVOHoapaa	As stated you can massage the bird in cold running water but it is a practice that though common s banned by UK environmental health inspectors. The reason it is banned is precautionary 'in case' it is not fully thawed and so doesn't cook properly. Having said that yu are not running a commercial kitchen so I would say that method is safe if you are willing to take the minimal risk.  You can also use a microwave to defrost. Follow the makers guidelines but again if you are thawing a partially defrosted bird you could be increasing the bacteria.  Your fridge should be at between 5 and 8 deg centigrade. the lower end should ensure your chickens are defrosted properly and remain safe for chilling/keeping food.  Your freezer should be at between 18 and 20 degrees centigrade.  Fridge/freezer thermometers are available at most good sized supermarkets.|`|oKFAt7Lsaa	yes i agree with you that care should be taken to ensure food safety.I think the answer is to leave the chicken at room temperature to thaw from frozen for a few hours or even overnight and then in the morning put it in the fridge until the afternoon when you cook it.  As always make sure the chicken has been cooked thoroughly and the juices run clear before serving.|`|2c7869fbf2bfda8e590501ddb5545f2caa	Your fridge must be up high then!

DjCalvin reply on January 7th, 2009 6:32 pm:    I too am addicted to this damn sauce. Thankfully my Tb still has the sauce.    This is what I tried today and it came pretty damn close:    I bought a pack of taco bell nacho cheese sauce (came in the cheesy double decker pack that they sell in supermarkets)     Note:  Taco bell nacho cheese is salty, i tried regular nacho cheese and it was missing something.. i found this and its pretty close.    I then went to taco bell and snagged 20 packets of fire sauce and got a taco with the lava sauce on it.    I combined about 12 of the packets of fire sauce with the nacho cheese sauce.    had the same consistancy and tasted pretty damn good.    Ill work on perfecting it, but I really think that those are the only 2 ingredients.    I think the taco bell nacho sauce is the big thing, because its so salty.

Whilst living in Greece my niece and her then American boyfriend came to visit me and I made lamb,spin age and rice.  They loved it so much the had two plates each.    I used leg of lamb cut, of course, but you can use any cut you want.  A tea-cup of rice  one medium onion chopped  two cloves of garlic, finelychopped  several sprigs of flat leaf parsley coarsely chopped  one tea-cup of olive oil  two and one half tea-cups of water plus  one more tea-cup of water    place the olive oil in a saucepan of substantial size add onionsand garlic, stir until soft but not brown add the meat and seal this all the way round adding salt,black and red pepper, a good amount of mustard powder stir this in and add one cup of water bring to boil and simmer if the meat is still uncooked add a little more water and simmer a little longer when you feel another half hour would be fine add your washed rice into the pan and stir then adde the 2 and one half cups of water and bring to boil when boiling add your spinach   and simmer until the water is almost gone, check that the rice is cooked if not add a little more water although I doubt you will need this.

Will efforts to boost metabolism help you lose weight and gain energy? Do you have a "slow" metabolism, and need to speed it up in order to lose weight? These are important questions for anyone trying to lose weight, but particularly for thyroid patients, who may be struggling against an impaired metabolism.  What is Metabolism?     When we eat, food is converted into energy. The term "metabolism" refers to the way -- not the speed  that your body processes and uses the food you eat. Rather than "faster" or "slower" metabolism, it's most accurate to describe metabolism as efficient or functional versus inefficient or dysfunctional.     Metabolism is made up of several components:     Basal metabolism  From 60 to 65 percent of calories you eat daily are spent keeping you alive and providing basic energy for life support. If you were to lay in bed all day, you would still need these calories to support basic body functions.   Physical activity  25 percent of your calories go to movement and physical activity.   Thermic effect of food  About 10 percent of calories are spent processing the food you eat. For example, if you eat 2000 calories a day, you should be burning 200 calories a day simply eating and digesting your food.   The Metabolism Formula  The winning formula to maintain your weight is that what you take in should equal the calories you expend...    CALORIES TAKEN IN FROM FOOD =    CALORIES EXPENDED FROM BASAL METABOLISM +  CALORIES EXPENDED BY ACTIVITY +  CALORIES EXPENDED DIGESTING FOOD (THERMIC EFFECT)    To lose weight, you have to reduce calories taken in, increase calories expended, or do both.    Surprisingly, many overweight people -- and thyroid patients in particular -- do not take in any more calories than people of average weight, and can sustain or even gain weight at lower calorie levels. If you fit into this category, your basal metabolism is lower, your physical activity may be reduced, and/or the thermic effect of food you eat is blunted. The end result: you don't burn as many calories as someone of a similar weight with a functional metabolism.     For you, losing weight requires that you change the output side of the metabolism equation -- you need to boost your metabolism and make it more efficient.    The Hypothyroidism / Metabolism Connection     If you have undiagnosed hypothyroidism, or your condition is not adequately treated by your doctor, almost anything you do to raise your metabolism on the output side may fail. So the first, essential step is to get a thyroid test. And if you have been tested and are being treated, you need to make sure your treatment is optimized -- including the proper drug and dosage, as well as supplements to support thyroid function.     Increase Your Basal Metabolism    Metabolism is somewhat a function of genetics, but you can increase basal metabolism by building muscle. Muscle cells are up to eight times more metabolically active than fat cells, and muscle burns more calories than fat. Adding weight-bearing or resistance exercise  such as weightlifting or exercise bands -- is one of the only ways to increase basal metabolism.    An efficient metabolism also requires the smooth running of many complex body processes that rely on sufficient antioxidant vitamins such as vitamin C and the B vitamins. Supplements to correct any deficiencies are therefore important.|`|FIvA9OVxaa	faster because you eat more then you think you do and you will consume more food then you would when you eat slower because you jaw gets tired and when that happens your mind tells you your full|`|AA11402528	the speed of how you eat your food doesnt matter. its HOW MUCH food you eat.|`|RIjjibnwaa	Faster because if you eat slower it fills you up more (apparently) so you wont want something else.|`|ExiYNaT9aa	Faster.|`|BxHJxSIzaa	fster because the slower you eat the more filled up you feel , the faster you eat the more you eat !    hope that helps|`|ODR1Woxyaa	it doesn't matter how you eat food. it matters what your eating and how often your eating.    1. eat 6-8 meals a day (small)  2. don't eat fast food  3.

Unless you carry on eating after feeling full .They say you should put your fork down between each mouthful as this encourages you eat enough to get full without gorging.|`|1cAz9coEaa	You gain weight by eating food slower it allows your stomach to digest the food faster and then to make you gian weight.|`|EquiVBqhaa	You may not necessarily gain weight by eating faster, although people that eat faster tend to be a tad bit heavier because it takes your brain 20 minutes in order to tell your stomach that its full. So people that eat faster tend to eat more then needed because there brain can't tell them in time.     Basically what it comes down to is your metabolism. If your a faster eater and have a high metabolism then you may not gain any weight. If you don't have a high metabolism and your a fast eater then you may gain weight.

bcd579b5470241b294acd9a9b0bbef85aa	Can you?  Yes.  Should you?  I don't think so.  Just because you can doesn't make it a good idea.    Absinthe is meant to be diluted.  The reason it's such high proof in the first place is to keep all the essential oils and essences from the herbs dissolved.  They're not water soluble.  When you add water, the absinthe becomes cloudy (it "louches") from the oils as they un-dissolve.  If left to sit long enough, it would eventually separate.  This is also why it's not sold pre-diluted.  It's ridiculously harsh and unpleasant to drink straight and that's why so many people who try it for the first time as a shot think it's horrible.  When you add water as it's traditionally served, it's not nearly as intense...both flavor and the bite of the alcohol.  However, its primary flavor is anise, so if you don't like that, you're not going to enjoy absinthe.    Oh and hi, apparently I'm nobody, and so is everybody else who drinks it regularly.  As were the millions who were before it was banned.  Given that it was drunk more than wine at the time of its ban, that's a lot of nobodys.|`|LnoyylQ7aa	yep been there done that, then regretted it, but done it all again anyway|`|rsTB7D1zaa	No reason why you can't.    People only go through the whole water and sugar dripped through a slotted spoon into a shot of absinthe to make it taste less horrible and make it seem special so that you are less inclined to proclaim it is horrible as it would insult the tradition.  It's just a game, nobody really likes absinthe.|`|95338b015043271c6167082a68ef5e88aa	Absinthe is very bitter; it's typically "cut" with some cold water poured over sugar cubes. It's probably best to drink it diluted in this manner since this is the way it's meant to be consumed and because this gives it a cloudy, green color.     As for being a bad idea; other than it tasting nasty, I'm not sure what drinking just a bit would be bad.|`|WKKdQq2Aaa	sure you can.|`|oA8Rtyxuaa	you can, but it tastes horrible! to me it tasted like a pine tree and i almost puked and i only had a very tiny bit. generally you have a slotted spoon and melt sugar into it or something like that!|`|xi0HEzFQaa	sure you can, dont cut your ear of like Picasso did when he drank it lol|`|7nJnk2OGaa	soitannlee|`|LMGWEPBtaa	Only a bit.|`|9B7CHdmGaa	For the record, Picasso never cut his ear off, Van Gogh did.. because he was depressed..    Aaand drinking any alcohol is bad, so it depends on how bad you're talking about.  It won't kill you, but I doubt it'll be fun...|`|tZ8hHhWbaa	Not only a very bad idea, a wate of money.

Crispy Chinese noodles     ****Serve over rice or noodles *****    Cooking Instructions     Before you start cooking, arrange all your ingredients in bowls or on plates so that they're ready to use. Once you begin cooking, it will all go very quickly; you won't have time to chop or cut anything.    In a very large skillet or wok, heat 1 tbsp. (15 mL) of the vegetable oil over high heat. Add your meat choice and stir-fry for 3 or 4 minutes until just cooked through. The amount of time will depend a little on what you're cooking. Remove to a bowl (but don't use the bowl in which you had the raw meat unless you've washed it first).   Add remaining 1 tbsp. (15 mL) oil to the pan. Throw in onion, garlic and ginger and cook, stirring, for about 1 minute. Now begin to add the vegetable possibilities to the pan, beginning with the ones that take the longest to cook (carrots, broccoli stems, etc.) and ending with the ones that cook most quickly (bean sprouts, snow peas). Cook, stirring and tossing for about 2 minutes, then pour in the broth, cover the pan with a lid and let everything steam for 2 or 3 minutes.     In a small bowl, stir together soy sauce and cornstarch.   When the vegetables are tender but still quite crisp, return the meat (or whatever) to the pan, stir and add the soy sauce mixture. Continue to stir-fry for 1 or 2 minutes or until the sauce is thickened and glossy. Transfer to a serving bowl and sprinkle the top with the extra bonus ingredient, if you're using one.   Serve immediately with hot cooked rice or noodles.     Angel Hair Pasta Salad     2 (8 ounce) packages angel hair pasta   1/2 pound cooked bay shrimp   3/4 cup chopped green onions   1 1/2 cups ranch-style salad dressing     DIRECTIONS:    Cook the pasta according to package directions; drain and rinse under cold water.     Mix together the pasta, shrimp, green onions and ranch dressing, then carefully work the shrimp into the pasta with your hands. (Note: As the salad sits, it will absorb some of the dressing; add a little dressing right before serving).

I would use buttercream, glace icing (icing sugar and hot water) or bought fondant icing that you roll out.

If you live in NYC you can go to the NBC store and they sell them with the Friends logo printed on them. Also, some meatball subs (Joey) and see if you can rent a foosball table!|`|iFCBEZW7aa	I like the central perk idea.  Cup hats, banners, and lots and lots of ice.  Serve sandwiches, pizza's, alcohol, coffee, tea, meat, and posh food for monica. macaroni cheese for chandler. beers for joey and chandler. margerita's for ross. fajitas for ross.  An etch-a-sketch on the door.|`|8dRhiDRNaa	Well, you have to have sandwhiches! After all that is Joey's favorite food! =)  Have a crockpot with meatballs or a meat and cheese tray with rolls and condiments and have guests make their own.  And doesn't chandelier love tater tots? I think that's what kind of potato he asked Monica to make on Thanksgiving when everyone had their favorites.    Find quotes from the show, print out individual quotes and put in a bag.  Have guests pick out of it and try to guess who said it.    Sounds like fun--Enjoy!|`|Kc8sFjwraa	That sounds like fun.. I have never seen the show Friends but good luck w/ the party|`|w5uHiNcoaa	What about the gold picture frame round the door spyhole?    For those who want to drink coffee, what about those big oversized coffee mugs.    However, I would steer clear of seving up a recreation of Rachel's trifle - I don't think custard and mince would go well!
