zqlpK7HQaa	My recent experience at Magnolia hasn't been great. You have to catch them on the right day - at least at the upper west side location.|`|Kb06TGUnaa	Magnolia is overhyped. Try Billy's... they just as good if not better and you wont have to wait in line for a CUPCAKE.|`|GITMn6eDaa	I don't know Billys. But magnolia is always good|`|sZgISiZkaa	Magnolia is over-rated...the cupcakes are small and the frosting is just like confectioners sugar and milk...something that you could make at home and it would probably taste much better!
tzrLDbHWaa	Try youtube, they seem to have a lot of stuff there.
6ZXi1pQpaa	At the restaurant where I am a server, if it is my table to begin with, I get the tip regardless if someone else stepped in while I am on break, etc.  But, that doesn't mean that if you feel the tip should go to the "replacement" server, then tip them on the side and do not leave a tip for the orginal server.  I have alot of tables that are technically not my tables yet I help out with tip me instead of the orginal server.|`|3bf411fb0977582b031f408308f1234baa	Not specifically sure about the Cheesecake Factory, but a lot of restaurants pool the tips and they are split evenly amongst the wait staff and a percentage is shared among the busboys.  My guess is that they work as a team and share the tips, based on your description.
tzrLDbHWaa	A server, easily.  Buffet attendants don't really make much.  Kinda depends on the buffet though.  Most people that I know, if the buffet staff brings drinks to you, and they're good, they get like a buck a person, if they don't bring you drinks, well then they really aren't serving you at all, and are lucky to get anything.    As for servers, well they get 15-20% of the total bill.  Definitely more profitable.|`|VvbOSbRnaa	A server for sure. You will make a lot more money. it will be a lot more stressful, but come the end of the night and working 4 hours and making $75 it's quite nice! :)|`|gaXUIduMaa	God no.  You get little if any tips, all you do is clear dirty dishes, noise, noise noise.   Be a server in a restaurant any day.|`|TqSPGmIoaa	server|`|Kk8gnQPiaa	Yeah, you guys, but the question asked about being a "servant."!!!  Oh, never mind.  That's very different.|`|SqPVrEaCaa	servers make tips
thcr8Y5vaa	KFC...|`|l1BNyWjcaa	Baja fresh  is my favorite but it is not to big of a chain and i do not know if the have a drive through so then it would be Arbys|`|VvbOSbRnaa	Chick-fil-a or Checkers.|`|qE5XIAsYaa	wendy's has the best chicken sandwiches.

It doesn't sound that bad considering all the other chocolate covered stuff out in the world, like grasshoppers and worms, etc.|`|AA11091315	That sounds kind of good. lol|`|lDO4O2FXaa	haha my opinion yes =] slurp|`|AwNsboB4aa	sounds odd...  i wouldn't|`|rWcwylM2aa	???How is that possible and if it is NO???|`|Qyeg2FB7aa	maybe..but only if it was like a boiled egg.|`|xRFhWMFSaa	You have a nastey taste in  food|`|FOxnFUEIaa	Nah i woodnt|`|4f56249b3cf71e82d66690849bb261f0aa	I would try it.

gaXUIduMaa	Um, those items are not that healthy although better than cheesecake.  Just go to the store and pick up a piece of fruit.
aiuKYAfMaa	mayb not scientists but they cud just get sued for false advirtisments    BUT fast food restaurants are notorious for bending the truth, mcdonalds (shittiest restaurant in the world ) probably means that they use 100% beef but mix the beef around with other ingridients or sum retarded **** lik that|`|ifTMSSjdaa	yeah they could there is some bill on it....  if they lie on a label it is really serious...|`|W48xQOJOaa	they could if they wanted to because if they wanted to i'm sure they would i know i would|`|3RmwBjLwaa	You don't have to be a scientist to sue 'em...|`|ZpDvYoakaa	I am a mad scientist and I sued them. I won a years supply of hamburgers. Yikes!|`|nz6Rc5GGaa	sure, CUSTOMERS have sued because of there own obesity so i'm sure a scientist or the FDA could|`|K7vNIDrHaa	who cares mc donalds is the ****
AA10591203	I'd go for it, Subway is much better than Quiznos!..|`|aiuKYAfMaa	research it more and find out WHY they closed in the first place. it could just be that they didnt like quiznos but mayb subway will do betta|`|JfVxCDb7aa	Very bad to open there. Quiznos is even better tasting thatn Subway, if they couldn't make it neither could a Subways.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	I would say sure, why not?  Where I live there has been a Subway for a long, long time.  A Quiznos opened across the street, and I actually preferred it to Subway, but the Quiznos eventually closed and the Subway is still there.  In fact, most of the Quiznos I know of have closed, and I actually find it difficult to find one still open.    I think one of the reasons the Quiznos stores have closed is due to their prices.  They were always fairly expensive, quite a bit more than Subway, and while I preferred the subs at Quiznos at the time, in our economy, most people are more concerned with the cost.  Lately I've seen ads for subs under $5 at Quiznos, but it was far too late since most of them I know of already closed.  I wouldn't take the fact that Quiznos closed down as it being a bad area for subs, as much as people didn't want to pay their prices.|`|378e8d7cc4f1b5cbff9df143195b7238aa	Do not open a subway there. Quiznos and Subway are very similar. If a Quiznos didn't survive, what make you think a Subway will survive? Even if it survived, will it be worth for a 200k investment? These are lunch type of businesses. So find a location that is near big tall OFFICE BUILDINGS. I know this very well

Anything that you do that doesn't waste food needs to be avoided.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, it depends on what you're really asking.  Can they serve it to you?  Yes, they can, and by the sounds of your restaurant, I would imagine that at least one of the other waiters has listened to the owner and done it.  So yes, it CAN be done.  Should it be done?  And I'm pretty sure what you're actually asking us is, is it ok to do this?  No, its not.  Its not sanitary, you have no idea what's happened to that cup of tartar sauce once it leaves the kitchen.
