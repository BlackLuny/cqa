I have a friend who was charged with battery when he was 17 as well and he went on probation for a couple months and I believe paid like $500. Also any medical bills could be dragged in and the guy you beat up could exagerate a little if he wanted. But anyways I'm curious to know why you beat him up to begin with?|`|XcqppKaOaa	You're probably going to get probation, unless they decide to just give you a warning.  My nephew beat a bully up at school and has been on probation for a year now.  It was his first fight ever, he had a completely clean record at school and no crime record.  Also, he was also given in-school detention.<br>  <br>  He lives in Texas and is 15 if it matters.  He didn't get fined anything-  Probation sucks enough though.  If you get probation, careful not to be provoked by anyone.  Everyone knows my nephew is on probation and try to provoke him.|`|Ipv3WoIcaa	If the judge finds you guilty he can put you in jail or give you a hefty fine as little *** 100 to as much as 1500 it all depends on your state and what happened to the other guy and his story, the judge could also make you pay for his medical bills if there are any.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Battery is a crime, not a traffic violation.<br>  <br>  You could do time.|`|flkVehA9aa	LOL...you will be lucky if all you have to do is pay a fine.

Whenever the people intend to offer at a trial (a) evidence of a statement made by a defendant to a public servant, which statement if involuntarily made would render the evidence thereof suppressible upon motion pursuant to subdivision three of section 710.20, or (b) testimony regarding an observation of the defendant either at the time or place of the commission of the offense or upon some other occasion relevant to the case, to be given by a witness who has previously identified him as such, they must serve upon the defendant a notice of such intention, specifying the evidence intended to be offered.<br>    <br>       2.  Such notice must be served within fifteen days after arraignment and before trial, and upon such service the defendant must be accorded reasonable opportunity to move before trial, pursuant to subdivision one of section 710.40, to suppress the specified evidence.  For good cause shown, however, the court may permit the people to serve such notice, thereafter and in such case it must accord the defendant reasonable opportunity thereafter to make a suppression motion.<br>    <br>       3.  In the absence of service of notice upon a defendant as prescribed in this section, no evidence of a kind specified in subdivision one may be received against him upon trial unless he has, despite the lack of such notice, moved to suppress such evidence and such motion has been denied and the evidence thereby rendered admissible as prescribed in subdivision two of section 710.70.

It clearly identified the Central Powers as the 'aggresors' and liable for paying the costs of the devastating war.<br>  <br>  However, the treaty did not end the war between the allies and the former Ottoman Empire, there was a off on truce for another 4 years as the winners divided the spoils of the Ottoman empire, arbitrarily creating new nation states across the former Ottoman Empire, such as Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, Jordan, etc.  The division laid the foundation of the modern middle East and Arab world... arbitrary nation states founded on thin ice which we are paying for today.|`|8446b0bd7a0c5d7795039d6c92b20599aa	It ended WWI and made Germany and Italy pay raparations to the allies for causing the war.

The Treaty was undermined by subsequent events starting as early as 1922 and was widely flouted by the mid thirties.

Si esto es lo que tu llamas buen socialismo y buenas leyers siento decirtelo pero en el caso de Venezuela estás equivocado. Tu sabes que cada quien tiene que vivir sus propias experiencias para sacar conclusiones y no es que los gobiernos anteriores fueran una maravilla, también cometieron muchisimos errores y esto que está pasando en el presente es producto de miles de áreas descuidadas por negligencia y por malos gobernantes, por mala aplicación de la Ley y de Organismos de control.

m74qoNsNaa	Desconozco el caso que te afecta, pero me consta que ese usuario es malintencionado (espero no confundirme con otro)<br>  <br>  Una reflexión: Dejémos de joder los latinoamericanos a los espa?oles, respecto a la coloniozación que llevaron a cabo. Nuestros países son lo que son por nuestra responsabilidad.<br>  <br>  Somos independientes desde hace casi 200 a?os y hasta hace menos de 100 seguíamos manteniendo el orden colonial. Hubo que poner en marcha reformas agrarias y cambios drásticos para cambiar la distribución de los recursos, pero eso es un problema nuestro, de nuestra sociedad, de nuestros gobernantes. Somos subdesarrollados - o en vías de serlo - por nuestra propia responsabilidad.<br>  <br>  Me faltaba agregar que pocas veces se resalta lo bueno. El legado cultural es importante. A mí me parece fantástico que casi todo un continente hable el mismo idioma y me siento orgulloso de hablar la lengua de Cervantes.<br>  <br>  Y si hubiésemos sido colonizados por otros, sería el mismo cuento. La ambición de colonizar y las atrocidades que pueden producirse en este proceso no son patrimonio de un pueblo, si no del ser humano... Miren lo que hemos hecho con nuestros propios pueblos indígenas y nuestras minorías postergadas...<br>  <br>  De ser cierta tu acusación (si el usuario aludido se dedica a insultar), me sumo a ella compa?ero.<br>  <br>  ____<br>  <br>  MMM, acabo de ver su perfil...

Además de la escacez de alimentos, medicinas, trabajo, el apartheid que vivimos los que firmamos solicitando un referéndum revocatorio no tenemos derecho al trabajo ni a los beneficios sociales por el tan solo hecho de aparecer en una lista elaborada por un diputado chavista llamado LUIS TASCON. Así mismo la inseguridad, los escuadrones de la muerte, los policias son los que matraquean, secuestran, asaltan, extorsionan así que la misma ciudadania se ha visto en la necesidad de crear sus propios mecanismos de protección y seguridad...Por otro lado, como que si no hubiesen otras cosas más importantes en las que ocuparse en este país, al teniente coronel no se le ocurre otra cosa que decir que va a eliminar los jeans en las mujeres, que se acabaron los tintes para el cabello, que se acabaron los trajes con escotes pronunciados o mejor dicho que las mujeres luzcan sus bondades...y entre otras cosas el uso de cosméticos...No se como harán los m a ri co nes que integran este gobierno.

Tu tienes que cuidar de las gallinas que el gobierno quito a los criadores de gallinas. El gobierno te da tanta leche y huevos como las regulaciones dicen que necesitas.<br>  <br>  FASCISMO: Tienes dos vacas.

Tus vecinos escogen a alguien para que te diga quien se queda con la leche.<br>  <br>  BUROCRACIA: Tienes dos vacas. Al principio el gobierno regula como puedes alimentarlas y cuando las puedes orde?ar. Luego te paga para que no las orde?es. Luego las coge, pega un tiro a una, orde?a a la otra y echa la leche al rio. Luego te exige que rellenes formularios explicando que paso con las vacas que faltan.<br>  <br>  ANARQUIA PURA: Tienes dos vacas. O vendes la leche a un precio justo o tus vecinos intentaran coger ambas vacas y matarte.<br>  <br>  CAPITALISMO: Vendes una vaca y compras un toro; reproduce y tiene muchas vacas, entonces o te sobra leche o te falta alfalfa. Si te falta alfalfa se mueren las vacas y se arruina. Si te sobra leche baja el precio en el mercado y también te arruinas.<br>  <br>  SURREALISMO: Tienes dos jirafas.

Son famosas las definiciones fatalistas de Carl Schmitt de la política como juego o dialéctica amigo-enemigo, que tiene en la guerra su máxima expresión, o de Maurice Duverger, como lucha o combate de individuos y grupos para conquistar el poder que los vencedores usarían en su provecho. Una perspectiva opuesta contempla la política en un sentido ético, como una disposición a obrar en una sociedad utilizando el poder público organizado para unos objetivos provechosos para el grupo.

"porque hablaba mal de la revolucion bolivariana" . Mi amigo, estas actitudes son TIPICAS de un dictador. en cualquier parte del mundo, suben al poder y se sienten dioses y que el pais que gobiernan es su chacra, su granja... su propiedad.<br>  Asi como Castro, que se deshizo hasta de sus intimos amigos, aquellos que empezaron la lucha junto a el, y no soportaba una critica, entonces pasaban a ser sus enemigos. Lo mismo sucedio con Stalin y con muchos mas. Sin embargo tenian miles y miles de seguidores, gente afiebrada que podia morir por ellos. Y esto mismo sucede en Venezuela, por eso es tan valioso ver las dos caras de la moneda, leer, instruirse y escuchar opiniones de la oposicion, esto te hace crecer y discernir.... <br>  Un gobernante esta para servir, escuchar, no para sentirse un dios y mandarse un programa semanal de horas y horas hablando mal del que no esta de acuerdo con el.

The Communist/Marxist Manifesto teaches you need a boogyman, a scapegoat to achieve your goals...So that is what they are doing.  But now it is getting a little stale...This market crash was caused by sinister forces that we know nothing about to instill fear in the Masses (Marxist term) but they don't count on that The American people have something inside them that they will fight for their freedom when their back is up against the wall...The opposition is getting louder and louder and soon it will be heard in the marble halls of congress and the White House.  They cannot insulate Obama forever...He has to be accountable to the people who elected him and they will ask him for a straight answer without a teleprompter of his goals and agenda for this nation and if he is a Marxist/Socialist.  They will ask him what is in his inner core as a person; they will ask where is this country going?  He can run but he cannot hide. P.S.

Rwn0svq0aa	If I were in charge of securing the southern border, I would do so with the sensitivity of being the great grandson of a slave. I would have the sensibilities of the many Irish and Jewish migrant workers who help build this country into a competitive nation based on cheap labor.  I would reach out to the farmers, the garment industry, construction companies and race track owners who employ immigrants in the shadows, and we would sit down and see if we can have a win win situation from a pro-business perspective. I would have a judicial review on the current practices of the U.S. immigration services to understand legal boundaries, goals and results. I would make sure these people are treated with the same dignity the Jews of the Holocaust should have been treated when they fled Germany. Many of these immigrants are from the Catholic persuasion. I would contact the Vatican and get a commitment from the Catholic Church to clothe the naked and feed the hungry.  <br>  I would ask permission from President Caulderon to bring in black ops and special forces and lay the wood on drug king pins, even if the city must be cleared out and we go "mano y mano," I would give them an *** whoopin for the history books.  <br>  I would seek to aggressively prosecute criminals and anyone who goes outside of the relationships, I have worked hard to establish with businesses, the church and community. The goal is for people to have a good American experience, instead of making new enemies who want to see our way of life destroyed. Then their are the "coyotes" these are the bands or gangs that provide safety and request ransom to get from point A to point B. They too would be on my list, right up their with the drug king pins. Finally, I would have the Coast Guard gain cooperative agreement for search and seizure on the ports, with the idea that drug smuggling into Mexico will cease and desist. I would use drones 25 to 40 miles out to sea patrolling the coast and to shoot on sight crookery and theft night and day.  <br>  I would get a joint resolution from the Congress and from the Mexican government to build industry between the two countries in order to have a controlled and verifiable migration pattern that will boost the U.S and Mexican economy, a custom fit for Latin America and a win for the southern flanks of the United States of America.|`|0eibkeO5aa	Land Mines|`|zNB3tZXraa	A large moat filled with sharks.|`|X81oLqMtaa	Hire illegal immigrants to do and pay them good money.<br>  <br>  The illegals know all the routes that smugglers take and are hard workers when you pay them well.<br>  <br>  Thus they would do a better job than the border patrol.|`|xagiOb80aa	I would secure a 25 KM wide buffer zone in Mexico using US Military|`|0d6d73c79e6856ec69bb6c658154c1ccaa	Force|`|WDaIQ0j5aa	Bring the soldiers home from Iraq and stand shoulder to shoulder , armed with guns to stop the invasion of this country.

There's no money going directly into your pocket and eventually we will have to pay it back through our taxes just like the last stimulus rebate that Bush gave up.  We had to pay it back through our tax return.<br>  <br>  For instance the working poor who are not eligable for public assistance (food stamps, earned income tax credits, medicaid, etc) don't get anything.  Most people can't afford to buy a new home or a car so if you don't see the benefits direclty you don't feel like it's helping you as an individual.<br>  <br>  Also, there's no real way to monitor how the big Corporations are spending this money.

I know here at Citi the plan is to outsource more than 70% of this division alone to India.  And to be honest the work is not getting done or done correctly.  A lot of people have lost their jobs to the Indian Consultants and made to train them prior to being laid off.  If they didn't train them then they wouldn't receive a severance package.  So if you're in a specialized job and it's that position is being outsourced in postly all the banks where can you go for work?<br>  <br>  Oh, and may I add that there's an increase in food stamps, etc but here in NYC the average 4 person household get's over $530 a month in food stamps but they cash them in for money.

5PIgZ7tFaa	It's just those two windbags faking reality on a daily basis. Fear-mongering has become the Republican tactic of choice since Bush took office. They know they have no viable alternative. Telling people they're going to lose their way of life is the only issue they've been able to come up with, it's the only way they think they'll get control of Congress when the midterms come up.<br>      Of course there has to be a certain amount of socialism in any society. Schools, police, fire, sewwer, water, etc. are all socialized service. You wouldn't want to have cops not showing up if there was a burglar in your house, because you didn't pay your police bill.

They are afraid<br>  <br>  One finds in the media increasing references to the prospect of socialism. The different factions of the bourgeoisie accuse each other of socialistic tendencies, while insisting on their own absolute commitment to the principles of free enterprise.<br>  It is ironic that this discussion of socialism is engaging a political and media elite that for decades has promoted anti-communism and anti-socialism as a virtual state religion. No faction of the political establishment is advancing a policy that in any way challenges capitalism or the interests of the financial elite. Nor is there yet a mass socialist movement of the working class.<br>  However, there is growing nervousness within this layer over the implications of the capitalist crisis and the potential for mass social opposition to the policies of the ruling class. Thus far, political discussion in the US has been contained within an extremely narrow framework. The diversity of views in the media and on the talk shows encompasses various shades of opinion within the wealthiest one tenth of one percent of the population.<br>  Yet there is an objective logic to developments. At a certain point—sooner rather than later—discussion of policy will escape their tight grasp. The masses of people who are directly affected by the global depression will become involved.<br>  There is a sense within the ruling class itself of an enormous anger building up, which, if unleashed, will assume the form of mass opposition to capitalism directed against the wealth and privileges of the financial elite. They are worried that socialism will then develop not merely as a specter, but as a living political movement embedded in the consciousness of millions of people. And they are right to be worried.|`|zI3YXvGLaa	I saw this yesterday...during the height of the lunar expeditions during the 60's.

It’s not illegal to make money and spend it on yourself (that’s actually good for the economy) It’s not illegal to make money and give it to charity. Why then is it considered evil to make more money than the guy next to you? Capitalism is built on the foundation of hard work and reward. If we as a nation remove that reward by “redistributing” the wealth of others we will loose the incentive for hard work. I was raised to be self sufficient. I work hard, and make a decent wage. Am I wealthy?  No, but I work hard for what I have. Why should I have to work for my money only to see the government step in and take away so they can give it to someone with less who may or may not have worked to achieve anything?  That’s not capitalism, that’s not America.|`|AA10096992	The problem is, those that control the wealth --  *surprise* -- reward themselves all out of proportion to their own labor or value.

It is especially frightening for a young woman trying to get through college.|`|rYE9VLQdaa	Yes he did. I think anti-gun people are afraid of guns and the times that they are used inappropriately. It is up to us, who are responsible gun owners, to make sure we are trained well and encourage other gun owners to be also. That way we will not give anti-gun people ammunition to use against us.|`|68149b1f13e1ba3a68e7e708172ff96baa	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  <br>  This liberal thinks the guy had every right to defend himself.

In Oct. 2007 the average rate of increase per year was about 4%.  Compare that to Clinton the dow went up about 30% per year.  I am not going to thank him for anemic growth that collapsed.|`|PPKuHl9baa	Absolutely. Common sense would tell you that. Too bad some people don't deal in common sense. They'll probably just say it was at 14,000 points because of something Clinton did back in the day.|`|AbHm1BBXaa	YES. You don't quite understand physics do you??<br>  <br>  Newton's First Law says a body at rest tends to stay at rest. A body in motion tends to stay in motion in a straight line unless acted upon by some external force.<br>  <br>  The same thing can be applied to the DOW(not literally, but figuratively you freaking dullards). And when did it start to fall?<br>  The stimulus is the outside force attempting to take it the other way.<br>  <br>  When the DOW falls like it did when Bush was in office, it will tend to keep falling until it hits rock bottom or something drastic occurs causing it to rebound.<br>  <br>  This is why they are hoping the real estate market will hit the floor sometime soon. <br>  Maybe you should listen more, and flap your wind sock less.<br>  <br>  Inflationary pressure related ot wartime spending, causing asset values to balloon, was the whole reason the DOW went up so fast int he first place. It wasn't sustainable in the 1920s and 1930s, and it wasn't sustainable in 2005 or 2006.|`|x3D2BUMEaa	Nope, because the house of cards came crashing down while Bush was still in office in case you didn't notice.

They couldn't care less..They embarrassed the U.S.A. in the eyes of the world and you know what?  They don't care.  Do you know he didn't hold a press conference which is customary when world leaders come to visit?  Did you know he did not give Brown a State Dinner?  Did you know he didn't bring him to Camp David?  Did you know he ignored him and humiliated him?  Wow, that is on the job training does for you...Totally uncouth...and ignorant of social graces and leadership.

Mr. Brown shouldn't feel bad, though - Obama doesn't like America, much less England, and he is just as rude and uncouth to the American people who don't fall down and worship him! I think it was a deliberate slight... just like using the middle finger during his campaign to rest on his face.... he's giving America the middle finger. <br>  <br>  But it's still embarrassing for those of us who are Americans and appreciate England and history. When obama took away Churchill's bust from the White House (which was a gift from England) and sent it back, I knew what was coming.. that he was going to show disdain for England in anyway he could.... however, that sure isn't true for the Muslim countries which he loves and by the way, gave his first, albeit, secret TV address after taking office.... he is favoring those he loves and trampling on everyone else....|`|EPObVPzVaa	No executive experience?<br>  <br>  No Foreign relations experience?<br>  <br>  How about no freakin' class?<br>  <br>  How about no social grace?<br>  <br>  The White-House is being occupied by rabble, cretins, low lifes.<br>  <br>  They are socialist trash.|`|eSGuZ5MFaa	obama has no class and  he  wont learn because he thinks he can do no wrong
d65d0f197c64d26de1e69f8246554c11aa	We have spent massive funds in the last six months to shore up the financial entities. Consumer and investor confidence has not improved in the slightest as a result of this action. The simple fact is that there is no confidence in the administration plans. Now is this all Obama's fault? The answer is not completely, but his constant fear mongering and plans for even greater increased spending and taxation on the business sector have certainly not helped the situation.<br>  <br>  Duchess X: Here is the answer to your query taken directly from the article you cited.<br>  <br>  "At the same time, investors have become frustrated with Washington, discouraged by a lack of evidence that the government's stimulus efforts are working."<br>  <br>  Whose plans are these? The answer is Barack Obama.|`|DY9NOh4taa	What is bringing the market down, is that every time that Obama makes a speech, the stock marker drops a minimum of 100 points, while Obama's approval rating has dropped from the high 70s to the lower 50s. And expected to drop lower, as Obama continues to push his stimulus package, that has done little to reassure Wall Street investors.<br>  Obama has had numerous opportunities since taking office to visit Wall Street and reassure the investors that better days are ahead, instead Obama is hosting parties for celebrities.<br>  The economy was in bad shape in 1981, when Reagan took office, but the only thing that he bashed Carter over was the failed hostage rescue, and leaving the hostages in captivity for 444 days.<br>  People have lost their life savings, when they have lost their homes, and they have lost their money that they put into the stock market, so that they would have money for their retirement years, is now gone.<br>  The American people are tiring of Obama bashing former President Bush, at every opportunity that he gets.|`|ljRE5MeAaa	It absolutely does!  Since his inauguration, he has had PLENTY of chances in his travels, to stop by Wall Street and offer them some reassurance.  Instead, he demonizes them EVERY chance he gets, and announces how he will punish them.<br>  It is no surprise to me that any time Obama is at the podium, Wall Street needs Imodium!|`|yuBuNoPDaa	No. It has very little to do with Obama at this point. It's likely the market will go even lower. <br>  <br>  There is another wrinkle with credit - it's going to be harder to maintain or achieve a higher credit rating. Credit card companies are cutting credit lines so it makes it look like more people are maxed out. We are in an adjustment period. We were pretty high for a while so it's going to take some time to get down to where we should be. <br>  <br>  David Cay Johnston - Free Luch - Perfectly Legal - journalist for major newspapers including the NY Times - I highly recommend checking out what he has to say. <br>  <br>  John W.

All his doom and gloom talk for political reasons is hurting the market.  I don't recall Reagan being so negative or talking about the Carter administration when he faced similar, but worse, problems..<br>  <br>  There have been no fear mongers worse than Obama himself..|`|ExCAedp4aa	The declining stock market has everything to do with more banks in big trouble and more large corporations on the brink and many more reporting staggering losses that were worse than expected.|`|GfphOIdOaa	No, it has to do with 8 years of emperor Bush|`|ZKaLJim8aa	yes|`|1ymL5LKlaa	Yes, government involvement in the economy will always generate a reaction in the markets.  Every time Geitner or Obama opens their mouths, the market drops.  Investors sell their stocks because they see the government involvement as detrimental to the value of stocks.|`|gZEn8k6Saa	Any sort of government involvement in controlling markets will bring negative reactions. The question should be considered is what he is doing, is it helping or hurting the economy in the future. Looks like higher taxes, less write offs sound good in speeches but will hurt businesses.|`|Xj6XZR89aa	i think it has a lot to do with the global recession every-one's screwed not just the U.S, you cant blame it all on one president.|`|jr4aNLLlaa	i'll give him this he didn't start this bad economy but he's continuing it and making it worse|`|c9c21b842bc0967b25ee1f5620157edfaa	Stock prices are an indication of what investors think is going to happen in the future (a bet that prices will rise or fall), it looks like investors think things are going to get worse and that many companies won't survive.<br>  <br>  Current policies don't look good for U.S. corporations, add to that that there is always risk in investing in stocks.  To counter some of the risk, they government provides the incentive of the long-term capital gains tax break.  The President said he wants to do away with this incentive.  So what we have is policies that will hurt business and an indication that one of the major incentives to long-term investment will be taken away.  <br>  <br>  And while the President says that there are bargains out there, if you buy a stock for $1 a share and the company declares bankruptcy, you get nothing, not much of a bargain.|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	No, it has to do with fear mongers like Limbaugh causing people to sell their stocks.|`|aGzLO9Oraa	Obama himself seems more concerned with public attitudes toward himself personally than he seems with the results of his policies.  He promised to take a scalpel to pork contained within bills written by Congress but when the stimulus bill was found to be so wasteful and lacked a targeted purpose to create jobs combined with his attitude towards the activities of corporations and CEO compensation, it makes him look like a dodo.  <br>  <br>  He also wants to just sign the pork laden Omnibus bill because it was written during the previous administration.  Even Bush refused to sign it yet Obama wants to blame Bush for this irresponsible budget.  He is setting a very bad tone for the next few years and most people from all walks of life can see this is a terrible way to deal with our economy.  I don't have the least bit of confidence in his economic policies either.|`|ujIinLzGaa	It has a lot to do with Obama. Obama has inspired a severe lack of confidence in the economy with his policies, including the "Stimulus Package."  You don't get out of debt by borrowing more money, and the stock market reflects the lack of confidence that investors have in Obama doing things like that.|`|RZfoszJFaa	Yes. <br>  <br>  Even though it was in decline, the market reacted more drastically to the ideas and solution of the Obama admin.<br>  <br>  This cannot be disputed because of the massive drops that are directly correlated to him presenting his socialist ideals live on TV and radio.|`|todJGCP8aa	No...look at today's headline<br>  <br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090309/ap_on_bi_st_ma_re/wall_street">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090309/ap_o...</a><br>  <br>  Stocks set to open lower after Merck deal<br>  <br>  Now, if you can tell me what Obama has to do with the Merck deal, then maybe you have something there.

Of course not!

Could I take Holy Communion in a Muslim country.  Why can't a Rastafarian legally commune with his maker in the UK?

x3D2BUMEaa	The AIG bailout began when Bush was still President and they received most of their billions in bailout while Bush was still in office, so that part of your listing is inaccurate.<br>  <br>  In the $490 billion omnibus bill, earmarks represent only about 1% of the appropriations in the bill because it is a budget appropriations measure to fund ALL government operations for the rest of the fiscal year.  40% of the earmarks have been submitted by REPUBLICANS and of the top 10 earmarks in terms of amount of appropriation, six were proposed and included by REPUBLICANS, so the claim that Republicans don't support the bill is a laugh.  I heard Sen. Richard Shelby saying this morning that he is voting for the omnibus bill.<br>  <br>  A stimulus package was supported by people of all political persuasions, but there were (supposed) disagreements regarding the particulars contained therein.  (However, most of the Republican opposition was phony because they knew they were not going to be able to stop the stimulus bill.)<br>  <br>  The auto industry, unlike the banks, has received LOANS that are to be paid back, so using the term 'bailout' is not really accurate.

The stimulus package was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on January 29, 2008, and in a slightly different version by the U.S. Senate on February 7, 2008. The Senate version was then approved in the House the same day.[1] It was signed into law on February 13, 2008 on demand of the democratic and independent parties, as well as a minority of the republican party. The law provides for tax rebates to low- and middle-income U.S. taxpayers, tax incentives to stimulate business investment, and an increase in the limits imposed on mortgages eligible for purchase by government-sponsored enterprises (e.g., Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac). The total cost of this bill was projected at $152 billion for 2008.[<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  BUSH:  The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, commonly referred to as a bailout of the U.S. financial system, is a law enacted in response to the global financial crisis of 2008 authorizing the United States Secretary of the Treasury to spend up to US$700 billion to purchase distressed assets, especially mortgage-backed securities, and make capital injections into banks.[1][2] Both foreign and domestic banks are included in the bailout. The Federal Reserve also extended help to American Express, whose bank-holding application it recently approved.[3] The Act was proposed by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson during the global financial crisis of 2008.<br>  <br>  On October 1, 2008, the Senate debated and voted on an amendment to H.R. 1424, which substituted a newly revised version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 for the language of H.R. 1424.[6][7] The Senate accepted the amendment and passed the entire amended bill by a vote of 74-25.[8] Additional unrelated provisions added an estimated $150 billion to the cost of the package and increased the size of the bill to 451 pages.[9][10] See Public Law 110-343 for details on the added provisions. The amended version of H.R. 1424 was sent to the House for consideration, and on October 3, the House voted 263-171 to enact the bill into law.[6][11][12] President Bush signed the bill into law within hours of its enactment, creating a $700 billion Troubled Assets Relief Program to purchase failing bank assets.[13]<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  WHY DIDN'T YOU LIST BUSH'S SPENDING ACCURATELY?  <br>  <br>  BTW;  yes, I do support the bailouts.

In the countries where drug use is legal and regulated, drug addiction is a fraction of what it is here and those who are addicted aren't out stealing from people to feed their habits.<br>  <br>  The real problem with drug use and abuse here is the taboo associated with it by our puritan moralist social structure in which we feel it is the duty of law and government to affect the behavior of individuals to fit rather strict social norms. Because of the pressure from within our own national society as well as that of our own families regarding what is right, wrong, mature, immature, etc, that which we are told not to do, we do compulsively so as to break from a mold we don't adaquately understand.<br>  <br>  The government's war on drugs and all anti drug efforts taken in this country other than frank education and rehabilitation are in vain. That is why our "leaders" can't control drug traffic.

We are at war with ourselves, not the rotten legions of suppliers, they're little more than parasites who would starve to death without our support. Until we get serious about facing the problem from top to bottom there will be no solution. And sadly I don't see that happening because there are no painless methods for bringing the millions of users back to normalcy, and the addicts are going to be the very last ones to face their problem.

No one forces doctors and nurses to work at clinics or hospitals where abortions are performed.  It's not as though they work for the government like employees of city halls in Massachusetts who don't have the right to refuse to marry gay couples.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  Ah, I get it now.

AA10988289	I think this is pretty much right, although I would say that many people these days seem to reject the idea of having an ethical code.  This is not to say that they lack any ethical understanding and their beliefs would be based on some ethical principles but very often these do not add up to a coherent code of ethics.<br>  <br>  Also increasingly common, and related to this rejection of formal ethical codes, is the problem of ethical relativism, which seems to hold that "everyone has their own opinion" and that one person's opinion cannot be said to be any better than anyone else's.  This is intellectual gibberish and it does not stand up to scrutiny but it is an increasingly fashionable was of thinking about ethics.|`|AA10690306	Exactly, confuse everyone else so I can do what I tell everyone else is wrong.   <br>  <br>  The Republican Credo!<br>  <br>  I do not say I live by a code of ethics, I just will not do like I see others (Politicians, Christians(Priests, Pastors, Preachers and Laymen)) the do as I say not as I do code of ethics.|`|jWO10NN5aa	My code of ethics is this:  if you don't like it, go pound salt.

Seems like one by one the possible leaders are either sellouts claiming to be conservatives when they got very liberal to appease voters, or people who can't really gather momentum.<br>  <br>  I still say with the past couple of elections and the mess that the Bush Administration made, the Republicans really need to clean house, find those who truly stand on the ideals, and support those people...even if it means more lost elections.  They need to stop trying to appease voters by pretending to be somewhat liberal.<br>  <br>  They also need to make a more convincing argument on why their ideals are better in their eyes.  Hate mongering on liberals only makes more people back off.  You get the moderates thinking this is the same old broken record while conservatives just give up and back off.<br>  <br>  If you disagree, then explain why people liked Obama over McCain.  In my opinion it's because the GOP didn't really reach out to new people as much as they just played the same broken record to whoever they still had supporting them.|`|ekkFxLH7aa	Right. But being that the Media is bias, including Yahoo, they are trying to brainwash people in to thinking this is true, and I doubt seriously that the Republicans do not have one.  What we have now is a President, but he is not a leader, he lets Peloski and Harry Reid lead and he is just a follower. I though BO was suppose to get Peloski and Reid in check, appears they got him instead. With them two nut cases doing the real leading, see the mess we are in. If some thing is said enough over and over, the Media can fool people into thinking things are true that is not true.|`|CggsiNgCaa	I have to disagree. I'm a republican, but that doesn't mean I don't like our president. I may not agree with him, but just because of that reason doesn't make a bad person, or a stupid one.

dFHsAXDMaa	It took 8 years for Bush to destroy are economy and people except obama to fix it in what 60 days come on people! here is a story for you all.<br>  <br>  <br>  Once upon a time in a land big and wide lived a world full of all different kinds of people. Some of them were old and some were young. Most of them were facing hard times while very few were content and happy. This was all because the leader of their country President Tree really had been messing up and ruining their land. <br>  <br>  The People of this land, which was called North of Mexico, held an election to replace President Tree. The election was held and many people came out to vote. They elected President Barboma. He promised he would make the country better and equal for all. After he has been president for 60 days, many people in the country started to wonder if he would be really be a better President.<br>  <br>  They did not remember that it took President Tree 8 long years to ruin the country and that President Barboma would need more time than 60 days because he did not have a magic wand that could fix everything right away. <br>  <br>  Over the next few years President Barboma worked hard and followed through on all of his promises to the country. Everyone in the country was happy, they had new jobs and homes and they were really happy. They were all realizing they made a good choice when they chose the new President, because they all went to sleep with full belly, under a strong roof and worked everyday at their wonderful jobs. Everyone in the land of North of Mexico lived happily ever after.<br>  <br>  You all need to wake up and realize Rome was not built in a day....our economy was not ruined in a day.... and it will not be fixed in a day. Talk to your relatives who lived through the great depression.. ask them how they survived it.. the answer will be :  families join together pooling resources.. neighbors helped out neighbors.. and the community helped each other. My grandmother tells stories about waiting in line for monthly rations of butter flour sugar and even pantyhose... smaller families share extra supplies with larger families and maybe larger families had bigger gardens and share fresh vegetables with neighbors..if your neighbor was a mechanic or plumber they helped another neighbor fix something just to help... The problem we have now in america is everyone is ME  ME ME....many people live on a road and do not even know the neighbors on there road...people lived the keep up with the Jones life style buying houses they could not afford one just one of the salaries of a couple.... yelled charge it as they went out to dinner or to the mall.. instead of spending within their means and unfortunatelty we are all paying for it now even the ones who did not manage their money poorly. <br>  <br>  So obama has a lot of work to do, Bush left this coutnry screwed to the wall... and Obama needs time and support to fix it... He is one man... a man without a magic wand or magical powers... but he is a man with a brain who needs time to oraginze and put his plan in action and congress needs to back him.|`|8m6fJ6cXaa	It started in '95 and Bush didn't start it.

08f47edd63e0224660f6c3d00e0c5830aa	Below is a report of a speech recently made by the Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd<br>  <br>  We need someone like him here<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   Prime Minister Kevin Rudd - Australia <br>  <br>  Muslims who want to live under Islamic Sharia law were told on Wednesday to get out of Australia , as the government targeted radicals in a bid to head off potential terror attacks.. <br>  <br>  <br>  Separately, Rudd angered some Australian Muslims on Wednesday by saying he supported spy agencies monitoring the nation's mosques. Quote: <br>  <br>  'IMMIGRANTS, NOT AUSTRALIANS, MUST ADAPT. Take It Or Leave It. I am tired of this nation worrying about whether we are offending some individual or their culture. Since the terrorist attacks on Bali , we have experienced a surge in patriotism by the majority of Australians. ' <br>  <br>  'This culture has been developed over two centuries of struggles, trials and victories by millions of men and women who have sought freedom' <br>  <br>  'We speak mainly ENGLISH, not Spanish, Lebanese, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Russian, or any other language. Therefore, if you wish to become part of our society . Learn the language!' <br>  <br>  'Most Australians believe in God. This is not some Christian, right wing, political push, but a fact, because Christian men and women, on Christian principles, founded this nation, and this is clearly documented. It is certainly appropriate to display it on the walls of our schools. If God offends you, then I suggest you consider another part of the world as your new home, because God is part of our culture.' <br>  <br>  'We will accept your beliefs, and will not question why. All we ask is that you accept ours, and live in harmony and peaceful enjoyment with us.' <br>  <br>  'This is OUR COUNTRY, OUR LAND, and OUR LIFESTYLE, and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy all this. But once you are done complaining, whining, and griping about Our Flag, Our Pledge, Our Christian beliefs, or Our Way of Life, I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great Australian freedom, 'THE RIGHT TO LEAVE'.'<br>  <br>  <br>  'If you aren't happy here then LEAVE. We didn't force you to come here. You asked to be here. So accept the country YOU accepted.' <br>  <br>  <br>  Maybe if we circulate this amongst ourselves, WE will find the courage to start speaking and voicing the same truths.|`|u1F5RRReaa	Am I the only one who got really angry by the mocking, sarcastic way he said "tolerance"<br>  This is more than mere rhetoric, I'm sure of that, but I doubt his vision will be realised. But the fact that the mentality of imposing ones religion on someone of a different religion by use of force, within any religion, is a worrying concept.<br>  I also worry that this will lead to a spread of reactionary forces in the UK. <br>  "for every action there is a reaction equal in magnitude and opposite in direction" so I worry that this will play into British/christian extremists who therefore try to portray every muslim as an enemy.<br>  <br>  What I'd like to see is more Muslim leaders coming out and condemning this Jihad mentality. I believe in multiculturalism, but if muslims don't want to become victimised and want to be treated as equals in Britain (not an unreasonable expectation) then I think their own community leaders have a responsibility to try to keep their own flocks in order.|`|zRyI5CMGaa	Yes it does worry me and that the extremist element like the individual in that video, it maybe rhetoric but there is a movement within Britain to bring Sharia law in and especially when you get people in high positions like the Arch Bishop of Canterbury promoting Sharia Law. There are sharia courts here already but they are not legally binding, to be fair many muslims just want to live in peace in the UK and do not want sharia law. I wasn't aware of these  studies though. If they want Sharia law then they need to live in Islamic country's like Iran & Saudi Arabia. Britain will never become an Islamic state and I would never live under an Islamic state or sharia law.|`|hv2nmmrqaa	It does worry me, because although the threat at the moment may be minor there are people out there promoting this way of thinking.<br>  <br>  They will slowly convince more and more people and it could become a problem some day. especially since the figures show that there will be a significant number of muslims in the uk withing the next 30 years.|`|OYcajEXIaa	sorry i couldnt finish watching it it turned me sick, i dont see why they dont through them all out and send them bl to where they came from and leave them kill each other instead of killing our boys (alot of them are my good friends) they pissed if they think im turnin paki religion, im trying to put it polietly and if ne 1 gets offended i dont give a **** :)|`|QzRLHXZ9aa	All fascists, whether they be Muslim or white nationalist, should be hung.|`|8f79a6907c34a502a5158ce4ade3c011aa	I found what he said in the last minute very true. It does hit the nail on the head perfectly.<br>  <br>  The problem is there has been no reformation period in Islam thus it is very  easy for Muslims to form a 'them & us' mentality. As he points out no other religion requires the overthrow of governments so they can be replaced by theocracy.<br>  Thus it is easy for extremists to dismiss moderates as "not real Muslims" since there is no reformed branch of Islam.(Ok the Sufi sect is different)<br>  <br>  As you can see from Carrie's response the "them & us" mentality is not exclusive to Islam. it is that style of thinking that cause and perpetuates these problems.<br>  <br>  The thing that i find intriguing is that while 40% of muslims between 16-24 would prefer to live under Shariah law. While only 17% over 55 wanted shariah law.<br>  So what is the reason behind this generations alienation that causes them to become extremists, when their parents came here and enjoyed the freedom from such practises?<br>  <br>  _()_<br>  <br>  (edit) @Paperback, Turkey is predominately Muslim and yet it banned the wearing of the hijab in public places. <br>  In my life time i have seen the change in Muslims from the idea of bringing Islam into the modern world to dragging the world into Islamic Dark ages. <br>  The Sufis are different even though they use the same Koran as other Muslims. It is due to that type of reformation Islam is not the problem. Rather it is the current generation in the west who seek to return to tribalism rather than assist in the reformation that Islam needs.<br>  I do not dispute that the majority of Muslims in Islamic countries want a global Caliphate. I do however question the cause of it. Here there is a secular education system that should help people overcome tribal thinking, so what has changed that is causing a backslide in the reformation process.<br>  This is point i raise. if you count the age of a religion in centuries and compare it to a person then Islam is a 14 year old brat. How different was Christianity when it was 14? Since you are a Historian (and i am not), look at the correlation of the age of a religion in centuries and show me which religions didn't undergo such life changes as they matured through their teens into modernity.|`|GOifC7i3aa	of course it is not just rhetoric<br>  and anyone who is not a muslim should be worried<br>  <br>  what really worries me is that our government denies this agenda and repeatedly states that we need more ethnic minority MPs<br>  <br>  if we have more muslim MPs they will be in the 'authority' position they crave.....and they will be in a stronger position to push for their rights and wants ahead of the interests of the majority<br>  <br>  in schools with a majority of muslims on the governing body they appoint muslims ahead of better qualified teachers......a shared faith is more important than the best person for the job<br>  <br>  they already riot to try to determine our foreign policy with israel and america.......they already have too much influence<br>  <br>  the worst decision of any government was to allow these people to grow to such large numbers in many british cities.....we are all suffering now as their true agenda is being made public|`|DZCFD0p2aa	Here's a suggestion to the muslims in the UK who want Sharia Law - go live in a country where Sharia Law exists. You move to countries like the UK, USA etc to get a better life because you think it's better. If you live in the UK and think Sharia Law will make a better life for you, them move to Saudi Arabia or something. Leave people who enjoy their way of life alone and don't expect them to change for you.|`|NnY1wG11aa	If you carefully listen to what he actually says any true loyal Muslim or his interpretation of a loyal Muslim must fight to establish Sharia law and eradicate all forms of present or future opposition, in his words if you are a true practising Muslim you are either in prison or on you way to prison for if you are not you are not a true loyal practising Muslim.<br>  <br>  The really worrying aspect of this Speech is that his idea of Islam is seen by many Muslin's especially young males as normal and that there are no or very few dissenting voices from within the Muslim population in Britain, where are they if indeed there are any.|`|tUOUy2Ewaa	It worries me, any threat to our Island home worries me... I think this should not be overlooked! This is treason.|`|4GiIXWUXaa	oh loooorrrrd ......  i'm an american and that still worries me.<br>  <br>  Though it was a bloody torturous 8:33 of psychobabble that in all honestly should be disregarded as idle nonsensical babbling threats that will never go anywhere, the fact that there are others who share that same opinion is what makes it worrisome. <br>  I don't know what's worse, someone delusional promoting and speaking of such things, or a bunch of delusionals that share the same violent opinion.<br>  <br>  *thinks* Usually only Christians speak about "taking authority" but it's only about spiritual matters. No worries, Xians only open of a can of jihad against you know 'satan and demonic beings' and such LOL ... <br>  <br>  In any case, that video was wacked. Too many people share that same opinion hence, a good deal of problems in the world. *sighs* <br>  <br>  xoxo ?<br>  <br>  *edit* LOL Kevin Rudd needs to join the Senate here LOL. (He's not all good, but he's not all bad either.) xo
AAJd6KsLaa	The political parties would hate it if people voted.  Then they would not get to decide on who gets to run for president.  They will try to suppress efforts to allow people to registrar on election day if is is not already allowed.  The politicians will uphold it because they work for 1). themselves, 2). the party 3). donors,   and ?).  somewhere way down the list - the American people.|`|gg6HnY2haa	absolutely.  And there is absolutely no reason there cannot be safeguards built into the system.  In fact, when i lived abroad i registered back here in the US and the county mailed my ballot after the election day (but my guess is that my name magically cast a ballot). That was me planning ahead to vote and my vote being cast away to who knows where.  With superior recognition technology why should't you be able to register on election day to do what a citizen should do and has the right to do, vote.|`|opoMNNAKaa	It may lead to fixed elections Voting is a privilege and responsibility for only citizens and this may make it easier for outsiders to control our elections.  Not a good idea.<br>  <br>  A serious voter is one who prepares for the vote, and responsible to know what he is voting for and why.  There is plenty of time to register since you can do it over a year and send applications as well as ballots.<br>  <br>  No excuse for being irresponsible.  Responsibility is the payment for rights.<br>  <br>  If you are a registered republican and want to see a democrat win, vote for the one of the weakest ticket to draw away votes from the one who has the best chance in the final debates for president.  There you do not have to vote party.  The same applies for those democrats who want McCain to win since he appears to be beating Huckleby.  Vote for Obama and he will since Hillary has experience debating him and taking stand on issues where Obama Passed.  Watch PCTN  or C-Span to see how government works.<br>  <br>  Learn and Register so you can participate on all 3 levels of government. They interact.<br>  <br>  By they way, for the purpose of local residence tax, it is necessary to report moving out of a area to another and also to let the voting board know to change your address as to the location or district you vote from.  These are rights:  moving and residing,and representation and responsibilities are;  report, vote and be taxed.
RD5sTZaFaa	You should listen to the guy at the bar and save yourself a ton of money.<br>  <br>  After all, he is probably just as knowledgeable as an attorney.<br>  <br>  I have never heard of a petition to disestablish paternity.  If you have not already been adjudicated to be the biological father, either by your divorce papers, or by a court in the child support proceedings, you may deny paternity and the court will likely order a dna test.  If you turn out to be the biological father you will have to pay the cost of the test, which runs over $500.00.<br>  <br>  If it turns out that you are not the father you will be dismissed from the case, and the mother gets to do it again with her next choice of likely candidates.<br>  <br>  You will not have to serve her with papers, because it is the case she started which will order the test.<br>  <br>  If you are the father you will be ordered to pay support, and if you do not have an attorney you will likely end up with what ever the mom says she wants.  This is not the time to be cheap, you are going to be paying at least until the child is 18.<br>  <br>  The papers you were served with would not have been issued by a lawyer, but the judge in the court where the case is filed would have their name on it.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

klj3cOFPaa	The crisis extends also to NV, AZ, and TX.  <br>  <br>  You don't know of anyone behind on their mortgage?  Just out of curiosity, how many people who are behind on their mortgages are likely to talk freely about it?|`|xxDjV6Axaa	I don't know anyone either and there are some very economically depressed people in my state.  From my work, I know a lot of people in this area.  FL is in trouble because a lot of those are second homes.  And some investors bought too high thinking the market would go up.  Of course now, Obama has killed that for them and they have short sell at unbelievably low prices.  I am sorry they have to do that but you should never invest more than what you can lose.<br>  <br>  If you can buy, this is the time.  Homes valued at $1M and up are selling for $200,000 and even less in FL.  Hold onto the property, rent it to vacationers (there are still those out there) and then sell when the market goes back up, probably in 2012.  If you can afford a second mortgage, you could be rich in a few years.<br>  <br>  One property I bought at short sell was $175,000.  It needed another $25,000 in renovations but it is now valued at $900,000 (if the market is good).  Because it is right on the water, I can rent it for $3500 a week.  Not all weeks will be rented but just one week a month more than pays the mortgage on it.  Any additional rent will go towards the loan as well so it will be paid off in less than 10 years.  I won't keep it that long most likely though.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Quite a bit of anecdotal evidence here being used as fact.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	My neighbors in Dallas dumped their house.

dFHsAXDMaa	Okay first of all this is all still   BUSH FALLOUT.... did you think everything BUSH did would instantly stop once he left come on people OBAMA has been in office 60 days he is going what he can as fast as he can to turn this around... the rule in life is things get worse before they get better right...well that is what will unfortunately happen in this cause <br>  <br>  It took 8 years for Bush to destroy are economy and people except obama to fix it in what 60 days come on people! here is a story for you all.<br>  <br>  <br>  Once upon a time in a land big and wide lived a world full of all different kinds of people. Some of them were old and some were young. Most of them were facing hard times while very few were content and happy. This was all because the leader of their country President Tree really had been messing up and ruining their land. <br>  <br>  The People of this land, which was called North of Mexico, held an election to replace President Tree. The election was held and many people came out to vote. They elected President Barboma. He promised he would make the country better and equal for all. After he has been president for 60 days, many people in the country started to wonder if he would be really be a better President.<br>  <br>  They did not remember that it took President Tree 8 long years to ruin the country and that President Barboma would need more time than 60 days because he did not have a magic wand that could fix everything right away. <br>  <br>  Over the next few years President Barboma worked hard and followed through on all of his promises to the country. Everyone in the country was happy, they had new jobs and homes and they were really happy. They were all realizing they made a good choice when they chose the new President, because they all went to sleep with full belly, under a strong roof and worked everyday at their wonderful jobs. Everyone in the land of North of Mexico lived happily ever after.<br>  <br>  You all need to wake up and realize Rome was not built in a day....our economy was not ruined in a day.... and it will not be fixed in a day. Talk to your relatives who lived through the great depression.. ask them how they survived it.. the answer will be : families join together pooling resources.. neighbors helped out neighbors.. and the community helped each other. My grandmother tells stories about waiting in line for monthly rations of butter flour sugar and even pantyhose... smaller families share extra supplies with larger families and maybe larger families had bigger gardens and share fresh vegetables with neighbors..if your neighbor was a mechanic or plumber they helped another neighbor fix something just to help... The problem we have now in america is everyone is ME ME ME....many people live on a road and do not even know the neighbors on there road...people lived the keep up with the Jones life style buying houses they could not afford one just one of the salaries of a couple.... yelled charge it as they went out to dinner or to the mall.. instead of spending within their means and unfortunatelty we are all paying for it now even the ones who did not manage their money poorly. <br>  <br>  So obama has a lot of work to do, Bush left this coutnry screwed to the wall... and Obama needs time and support to fix it... He is one man... a man without a magic wand or magical powers... but he is a man with a brain who needs time to organize and put his plan in action and congress needs to back him.|`|VIhj7ghUaa	The stock market fell over 20% IN ONE DAY when Ronhole Raygun, whose asshole policies caused all these scams, was still president.

When the Dow hit 10K it basically meant that money was worth less, not that stocks were worth more. This might have been connected to the GWB administration's fairly openly declared war on Social Security trust funds.<br>  <br>  The economy is, indeed, looking ugly for the near future, and the stock market reflects that. But that would be the case in the early stages of any administration following the last set of clowns.<br>  <br>  We're in a position analogous to the following: somebody stole our car keys, took the car on an eight-year joyride, stripped and sold all the parts they could cash in on while keeping it running, and finally smashed it into a brick wall. Now they're hanging around yelling at the tow-truck driver that they're afraid he'll dent a fender.|`|V03nUMXBaa	Its a shame that you ignore facts.  <br>  <br>  1-  This is a world wide crisis, not just in the U.S.<br>  2-  The stock market would be doing the exact same thing even if McCain won the election.<br>  3-  Historically, the stock market performs BETTER with a DEMOCRATIC-controlled government.<br>  <br>  i know, facts are a b*tch.|`|Ht4lD0XTaa	They the politicians have their constituents believing that wall street is nothing but crooks and it's all George's fault, there is little hope to change the fools minds.

Since there are hardly any married gay people in the U.S. compared to the total population (I'm not even sure if they show up on these statistics) and Divorce rates in the U.S. are about 45%, then one could conclude that a huge portion of heterosexuals do not really believe in the sanctity of marriage.  25% of married males have had affairs and 17% of females have committed adultery. I'm heterosexual and I say, gay people can go for it. You can't make mud dirty. How can gay people de- sanctify something that 45% of the heterosexual population do not honor as a lifelong commitment? It's like saying, "I don't trust you to drive my car." "So I'm not going to give you  the keys to a car, that I just completely wrecked."  I think it's very hypocritical. The people who have the legal right to marriage, have treated marriage like a meaningless document. They leave their so called, "Sacred unions between a man and a woman", at the drop of a hat. They leave with little regard to the overall welfare of the children of their divorces. They leave because someone new has captured their eyes or their minds or their hearts or maybe, just plain made them horny. They leave because marriage is hard work or because they weren't ready for that kind of responsibility. I am so sick of people calling marriage a holy, sacred  union between a man and a woman. Look around you! Almost half of our nation regards marriage as a temporary, legally binding contract, that can be dissolved for a few hundred bucks, if  everyone agrees. "Don't let the gays destroy the meaning of our sacred vows and our holy unions!" What a f**king joke! Gay people, you can have it! You couldn't possibly desecrate marriage in our country worse than we already have.
UqLEMXAgaa	The rich will hold on to it.<br>  The poor will spend it all.|`|AA12198572	Not one or the other, both or all classes. I agree with the above answer where: "the rich will hold onto it, the poor will spend it all. I believe if you spend it on the poor it should be put solely into solving the problem of their poverty... unemployment. Spend it on getting them a job and cure the issue rather then simply wasting tax payers money on putting a band aid on it (Welfare). As for the rich I believe that they have worked hard to get those fortunes (or born into it if their family did), This means that we should spend their portion on ensuring tax cuts and protection for their job and business.

As they approached the border with Azerbaijan, they came across an Armenian military post and were cruelly fired upon”.[8]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/karabah/Hojaly/" rel="nofollow">http://www.memo.ru/hr/hotpoints/karabah/...</a><br>  <br>  The Armenian side states that the killings occurred as a result of wartime military operations, and were in part caused by the prevention of the evacuation of town inhabitants by Azerbaijani forces. Armenian government officials asserted that the casualty count, though high, was due to the fact the fleeing civilians in Khojaly had mingled with the retreating defenders and when the Azeri troops shot back, Armenian forces fired upon them, killing both soldier and civilian alike. Helsinki Watch itself concluded "that the militia, still in uniform, and some still carrying their guns, were interspersed with the masses of civilians." [9] However, Human Rights Watch and Memorial, found this explanation of Armenian officials unconvincing, stating that the mass killing of civilians could not be justified under any circumstances. Human Rights Watch noted that “the attacking party [i.e., Karabakh Armenian forces] is still obliged to take precautionary measures to avoid or minimize civilian casualties. In particular, the party must suspend an attack if it becomes apparent that the attack may be expected to cause civilian casualties that are excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated."[10]<br>  <br>  The Armenian side refers to Ayaz Mutalibov's interview to claim that the massacre had been committed not by Armenian soldiers but by Azerbaijan Popular Front militants who allegedly shot their own civilians escaping through the corridor. In one of his interviews Mutalibov stated that the event could be a ploy by opposition to denigrate his government. In later interviews, however, Mutalibov would go on to condemn the Armenians for what he said was a blatant misinterpretation of his words.[11] Other theories proposed by the Armenian side were that Azeri Popular Front soldiers had massacred 100 Azeri and Armenian civilians and then proceeded to mix the bodies and lay blame upon the Armenians.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.human.gov.az/?sehife=etrafli&dil=en&sid=MTc0ODE4MTExMTQ5OTI5OA==" rel="nofollow">http://www.human.gov.az/?sehife=etrafli&...</a>

n2oEhdZiaa	1. Could be searching for a weapons cache or who knows what... but the way they're walking around spread out side to side kind of looks like they are searching for something.<br>  <br>  2. recoil is what you feel from your weapon pushing back against you when you fire.  It's implying a terrorist is nothing to you so you feel no emotion as you kill him, just the mechanism of the act.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	The first picture is a Squad (- 9 to 10 soldiers. Typically commanded by a sergeant or staff sergeant, a squad or section is the smallest element in the Army structure, and its size is dependent on its function. ) on a patrol (out looking for bad guys).<br>  The bumper sticker is referring to the rifle recoil (kick or jolt) from firing a round or bullet.|`|YWqWb7JSaa	Don't know what the picture is of, looks to me like a patrol of some sort.

That sticker is so Marines :)|`|OGiSHHZaaa	they're on a foot patrol.<br>  <br>  lmfao that's a great sticker....when you fire a gun there's a recoil and it can knock the weapon back towards you slightly...that's what you feel when you kill a terrorist.|`|7bc450c6091ac93a4d64108b856a5e7daa	1) looks like a squad patrolling in afghan or by n. iraq (no u.s. almost)<br>  2) = lol, recoil is the rifle kick back :) Definitely a Marine bumper sticker|`|jKiVzmnCaa	The 1st picture -- they could be doing numerous types of mission.  That photo itself doesn't indicate too much.  They could be spread out looking for holes/tunnels/weapon caches/etc.  They could be at a range practicing various maneuvers.  The soldier holding up his weapon probably is looking through a scope into the distance.  But, whichever it is, I'm going to say that they're probably bored.<br>  <br>  And the 2nd picture of the bumper sticker.  Recoil is what you feel after you fire your weapon.  The weapon on it looks like a 50 cal -- which has a pretty nice recoil (and tons of power).<br>  <br>  So -- what do you feel when you kill a terrorist?  The recoil of my weapon being fired at them.|`|AA11538332	First photo is a squad on foot patrol.  They are spread out like that so that it is harder to kill many of them with one grenade or mortar round.  The one soldier is looking through his scope at something that caught his eye -- generally some movement in the distance -- and is checking out the potential threat.<br>  <br>  The bumper sticker is a pretty typical Marine thing -- when you fire a weapon, Newton's Second Law (Conservation of Momentum = for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction) applies.  When you fire a rifle, the bullet flies out one end of the rifle.  To equalize the momentum of the small slug flying at great velocity, the rifle "kicks" back -- recoil.  So, when you shoot a terrorist, you feel the recoil of the rifle.  The play on words here is on "what do you feel?" -- remorse, sadness, regret, anger, or some other emotion.  For a Marine, they feel no emotions, just recoil.

The standard catch phrases are to ease the suffering//save the children(animals,rain forests,earth) ...Lately the catch phrase is to reduce the inequity, insure that people are able to receive  xxx  because they are entitled as members of the human race. <br>  ....The "filthy rich" have more $$ than they or their heirs could spend in a lifetime..A million here or there given to whatever moves them is a minute % of the interest they earn. I, too applaud those  super wealthy folks who give to various charities. <br>  ...The LIB's or those that think "taxing the rich" will mean "more" for them are beyond delusional. They have yet to understand that NO one's "life" on this planet is immune from loss, hardship, potholes ,random acts of nature or accidents from fires to falling off a curb,etc. No one is guaranteed good health, rich or poor parents or even a family. One's quality of life is always determined BYthe individual and the choices they make and the effort they use to acquire what they want/need.  Many things/events in ones life will require that the individual make changes ,seek a different path, ask for help,learn a new skill etc.  Libs seem to believe that those that chose to whine about their "potholes" or burdens should be classified into a group that can be managed like a kindergarten. Once provided with food, shelter lots of other "services" they will be docile and a grateful as a kid given an ice cream cone. Despite the childish squabbles over who has/gets what they can be a valuable asset for political power games. <br>  When welfare was reformed to require the hale&hearty to actually get new skills, work etc ,their outcry was used to demonize the very idea that REPS wanted to cut entitlements/monthly checks for those without medical problems. OMG! free child care to learn a skill, $ to cover food /shelter and free training)  <br>  ..This class was suddenly "entitled " to "HELP=tax $$) -> GIVING $$ when the "need" IS real* is good //Giving $$ when the need is due to the the mind set of "YOU owe it to me because I want it /my kids will starve/ etc is WRONG. <br>  ...Each person can CHOSE some chose to achieve others chose to demand and many (LIBS) think that OTHERS hard earned $ should be USED to keep the very class of people they created w/ welfare !  A hand up ($) after a set back differs from creating and providing for a class of healthy, whiny,irresponsible folks who think they are owed a specific "life style" and are unwilling to act as responsible adults. <br>  <br>  ...REAL need  can occur to anyone at any time.Those that use their "help" to fix or change or rectify their difficulty and get back on track are generally those that easily lend or give when another is in need. Who gives when another needs help depends on whether they are givers or "takers" , Everyone is human but all humans are not alike! ...Societies thrive when the majority of the population provides for the truly NEEDY (aged, ill, disabled,youth services ) and those (and their families) who serve to protect and defend the nation. The USA achieved success because the PEOPLE chose to make their paths and not wait for the crumbs doled out to the poor/beggars when or if the king or parliament wanted to appear as generous sympathetic elite. If their wagon broke they got it fixed,they worked to get food or shelter, they they endured crop failures,drought /floods often with little help from their similarly distressed neighbors  and they learned that saving for the unexpected minimized hardship when xx went bad. The GOV was never designed to provide food/fuel/housing/medical care, care for children because parents cant/wont/ don't care  etc. Over time- as the nation prospered, The US provided free education,created plans to help the elderly,infirm,disabled etc AS did various churches, or" wealthy" who built/funded orphanages, hospitals etc <br>  ..Libs can feel free to demand that OTHERS support things,plans people but NO society or nation has ever prospered  when  much of the society is non productive and prone to outrage when they dont get their ice cream! sad to say but we already have 40 ++% of the needy who want their ice cream delivered and soon will demand free HD,and high speed internet (you know -for the kids).|`|PwQn0Oixaa	No...no one would.

I don't buy for a moment anyone who claims they'll pay all their taxes because it's the patriotic thing to do.<br>  <br>  I don't know the right answer to the question, but I find it funny how many at the top complain that the government is going to take their money when they have been getting enough money from them over the years.  I'm not talking about bailouts, but government contracts and other purchases and such.<br>  <br>  Many companies spend a lot on Lobbyists and campaign donations to get legislature passed to help their own specific business.<br>  <br>  Defense companies give big donations because they want those government contracts, or even things opened up to allow them to sell weapons to other countries.<br>  <br>  Pharmaceutical companies give big donations because they want universal healthcare held back and sanctions removed on their products...so they can charge more and make more money.<br>  <br>  Media companies donate because they want elected officials to come on their shows and boost their ratings.<br>  <br>  Oil companies donate because they want a piece of the pie in the Middle East and to get more land to drill on, when they have enough as it is...as well as less policy pushed on "going green".<br>  <br>  Many major companies give loads to politicians simply to try to keep their tax rates low, even if it means their employees have to pay more.<br>  <br>  Haliburton gave enough just to get the big deal to supply our troops with all it did in the Iraq war.  We ran up a deficit to make them rich.<br>  <br>  Everyone is getting a piece of the big government pie.  You think Gates or Buffet aren't trying to secure some deals with all that stimulus money that's coming out?

fAaLjlI0aa	If the medical condition is real and verifiable, then they may be able to plead "Not Guilty By Reason of Insanity" or "Diminished Capacity". Mind you, neither will likely result in a complete acquittal, but it can result in the charges being reduced. The reason for this is that, while the courts recognize that sometimes mental health issues and other situations (such as brain damage, retardation, etc) are a factor, and sometimes a cause, of a crime, they still have a duty to protect society. <br>  <br>  Persons who plead insanity,even when acquitted, are usually sentenced to some time in a psychiatric hospital, with particularly violent offenders sometimes sentenced for many years to hospitals for the criminally insane. <br>  <br>  Of course, everything varies by jurisdiction. I believe California abolished the "Diminished Capacity" defense soon after the case of Dan White, who murdered Harvey Milk (subject of recent movie release, Milk).|`|3PdBGesIaa	i was in prison with a young boy who had down syndrome and autism <br>  he was severely re-tarted and he got a life plus 10 years sentence for a double murder, if you have a mental condition or a IQ level lower than a 62 they just wont put the needle in your arm is all but they will sure put you in a max sec prison though regardless of how crazy ,blind ,re-tarted,you are the system don't care all they know is the state is going to be getting that 144$ a day for you being locked up|`|BSinJ8mcaa	If the mental issue can be proved by a court approved doctor in most cases the charges maybe lowered or the person maybe placed in a mental hospital.|`|OLCoFKQraa	In the movies they plead insanity, but if they're found not guilty, they still have to get treatment at an insane asylum, y'know, based on what happens in the movies.|`|CFQbdDRNaa	Capital punishment should not be called that, for it's not a punishment it's a good answer!We should realize that the reason we put people to death is to get rid of a problem that wont go away and quit kidding ourselfs!

It states nothing regarding hunting or protecting your private property.  Bear in mind that this was written during the American rebellion against the British, so the importance of a militia was high given that the colonies lacked a standing army.  <br>  <br>  I think most liberals realize that the text is about defending yourself from the government, but most of us also realize that most guns aren't used in that manner, and at this point we HAVE a standing army, and that most private militias are rather dangerous.  The second amendment was written during a time of muskets and crude rifles.  They didn't have assault rifles or easily reloaded/fired handguns, so they also didn't have many lunatics that could attack a crowd of innocent civilians.<br>  <br>  I don't necessarily oppose gun ownership, but I think it's ridiculous at how strongly regulation is fought in this country.  Is it so much to ask that a minimum of responsibility is assured before someone is handed a weapon that can easily kill dozens of people?<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, if you think that the second amendment is the second most important right in the bill of rights, your priorities are way out of whack.  There are several important ones in the first, and you can't go based solely on order because the third is regarding the quartering of troops.  Do you really worry more about soldiers taking over your house than about, say, a right to a fair trial?|`|5ff6c450a0786035aba431374bf6fc0aaa	Text of the 2nd Amendment:<br>  <br>  "A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed."<br>  <br>  So go start yourself a well regulated militia, and quit complaining.<br>  <br>  <br>  edit: Please explain to me, in detail, the difference between "militia" then and its definition now. Then, explain why you would not be able to start a local militia in your area to fufill your 2nd amendment rights. <br>  <br>  also, calling me a "moron" would hold more water if you hadn't misspelled "militia".  your ineptitude is astounding.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	Which liberal?

Just one.<br>  <br>  Big governments create big problems.|`|a9etFur6aa	regulated capitalism you mean. Regulated capitalism is the best answer.|`|4GeKyXnmaa	Your a blind idiot, you like socialism then go visit freaking Russia!|`|g3ZJcIWlaa	Uh no....government made this problem(i.e. Community Reinvestment Act, allowing labor unions)|`|c1y6cmAraa	Uh wow, you're a fool.|`|qlYEF0YAaa	Capitalism is the most effective way of distributing goods, services, labor, and intellectual innovation. The government must be an effective referee, or else the system becomes  disjointed, openly hostile to other interests, overly conservative, not open to innovation. That describes our trading outside of our country. A small economy can survive socialism, or a dominating central government, but once it reaches a " critical" size, it will fall victim to the same pratfalls of an unregulated capitalistic system. The size of our GDP makes control by a single entity impossible unless you severely restrict output and ideas. <br>  <br>  This meltdown would have stopped if the CMO's were downgraded from AAA investment grade to junk bond status. The failure of the rating agencies and the government failure to call them on it helped cause this massive shrinking of our GDP. Granted we were do for a reduction because of over-leverage, but the Junk CMO's certainly made us crash. Our system is too large for socialism, and although the "referee" failed us in the capitalist system, you don't kill the patient to get rid of the illness.|`|cgb4WOnVaa	No sir - over-regulated capitalism - Congress telling the banks who they must lend to and how they must conduct business - got us into the mess we're in now.<br>  <br>  A lifestyle of "get it now, pay for it later" also contributed to the problem - that too, is a problem of BIG GOVERNMENT, not capitalism.<br>  <br>  The biggest problem with socialism is that, sooner or later, the productive minority get tired of supporting the unproductive majority, so they also become unproductive - then everyone has the same amount of NOTHING!  Total equality.<br>  <br>  Look up the financial history of Argentina over the last 20-30 years, if you have any doubts..  Or look them up under the first Peron government.  Do we really want that?|`|w32fvww1aa	We are nowhere near unregulated capitalism smart guy, ever heard of welfare, social security, food stamps, bailouts? all socialistic policies.  The problem with socialism is that what happens when a person who worked long hard hours all there life starts to get part of their paycheck taken away and given to a slacker who hasnt worked or tried to work a day in his life?<br>  <br>  Too much of either one is bad, but look at China, they are realizing how a socialistic nation CAN NOT work, and are slowly becoming more capitalistic.|`|QX2xnrhWaa	oh please, don't go there!  I'm French American and if you want to see what socialism leads to, I suggest you visit France and live there for a while.  You'll see how happy people with the fat Mr. Government sticking its nose everywhere.  High unemployment, low social mobility, strikes every year by civil servants, one of the highest rates of depressed people in the world (if not the highest)... is this what you want for America?

Wiretapping, warrantless searches, loss of Habeus Corpus and Posse Comitatus, all while the borders are being kept open (which help shows their hand).  Our government's high ranking officials in both the executive AND legislative branches haven't done a damn thing about the aforementioned early stages of tyranny.  If anything, they have assisted it.  That's all.  <br>  <br>  Greed (for power) reigns throughout our government.  And to answer your 'subquestion', I know more than I want to about our government.

That being said the people in a government system like in most western cultures (the USA included) have the ability to oust a tyrannical government at every election.  As a citizen you have the right to become part of the political system and make change.

All the other history teachers in my district did the same.<br>  <br>  You went to a lousy school or you spaced out when that was covered- clue: it is usually covered long before the Civil War assuming your class was taught in the traditional chronological way.|`|TSsmnZdkaa	Not just that, but the Federalist Papers.  It spells out exactly what the founders believed a freedom and liberty loving country should be.  If those things WERE taught, we wouldn't have people voting for "hope, change, and progress" away from these values.

My brother told me on family day that his platoon only lost 2 or 3 guys and his platoon had like 50 something people. Well when my brother enlisted in Jan 2008, his recruiter told him to go do PT to get ready for boot camp at Fort Monmouth which is a place where Marines/Soldiers work out, but you need some sort of ID to get a pass for parking and what not, and he left for boot camp in May 2008. Graduated August 2008. If you aren't old enough to actually go onto a base where you can work with other soon to be recruits to do PT for boot camp, then you can get your best friend to do "around the house" kind of work outs like pushups, running miles, pull ups, and sit ups. Those 4 things are the major things that you need to complete in order to graduate.

These are the people who the Parris Island recruits gave the label to, because we went through boot camp at MCRD in San Diego.  We graduated twelve weeks later with 26 out of the original 96.  The fallout rate was pretty severe, in the old Corps.  This was Platoon 1076, circa 1957.<br>  <br>  The story back then was the Marine Corps determined which recruit depot to send you to, was based on an individuals IQ.  Those with an IQ with two digits went to PI, those with three digits went to MCRD.  It might still be the same way.|`|TT7f5hBEaa	talk to a recruiter, then you'll take the asvab, considering your not a total idiot you should be able to get in, then comes your trip to MEPS, you'll talk to the liasion and go through a bunch of hurry up and wait but you'll enlist and SWEAR IN, next since your still in high school you'll be in the delayed entry program where there going to work you out so don't worry about boot camp, then when boot camp comes considering you have done the necessary training while in delayed entry you should make it through, plus the 5 out of a 100 thing is a total lie also your question isn't  ridicuolous but you will get the chance to workout trust me and the girl above me is wrong youdon't have to go to a base to workout, instead your recruiters office where they'll tell you what to do|`|7bc450c6091ac93a4d64108b856a5e7daa	First of all you're not a cadet you're a recruit.

A0zVswY2aa	I'm in the Army and I have a very high clearance level to say the least. I actually work with other peoples clearances and I would say that you should get the clearance. Charges dropped right? If it wasn't any time tooooo recently. I mean Secret clearance seems like a big deal but really if you're an upstanding citizen for the most part then you've got it. Just don't get in trouble while you're in and you'll be fine. A lot of people actually have secret clearances and don't even know it. So yes you will most likely get your clearance and your job. And hell, even if you don't, there are a ton of options for you in the military and being in the situation you are in... the money and benefits would be well worth it. And if you have a BA already you might want to try going officer instead. A lot more money for one and you get the same benefits and more respect. Think on it. LONG AND HARD! before you decide though. Make sure you ask a lot of questions because thats where you'll get messed up. Or you could just enlist as an E4. Still good pay but like I said. Think about it.|`|2zym4J9xaa	You're fine.  Secret Clearance is easy to get, they give that to everyone unless you have a serious criminal record, and they check back to 10 years for TOP SECRET which is real hard to get and you need to be squeaky clean.<br>  <br>  Don't sweat it.<br>  <br>  The reviewer looks at the circumstances and the situation and the age you were at the time of the charges.<br>  <br>  Also... you can be arrested and convicted... just depends on the seriousness of the charge.  Such as DUI's arn't that big of a deal.  A waiver for 1 DUI in the last 10 years.   The domestic violence charges will be reviewed on a case by case... they don't carpet everyone.  Everyone has their own clearance decided by the overall presentation of yourself and can the trust you... not your charges.  Certain charges will keep you out though... felonies in particular.|`|UoAZLRG8aa	Moral Standards <br>  The United States Military Services make every attempt to assess the moral quality of potential recruits, and several categories of moral offenses may preclude enlistment. This is primarily accomplished based on criminal record. <br>  I should note here that there is no such thing as a "sealed record," or an "expunged record" as far as the military is concerned. The recruiting services have access to law enforcement and FBI investigative records, which -- quite often will list arrests in these categories.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	You can be arrested for anything as long as the charges were dropped, dismissed or you were found innocent.  I've seen a guy charged with rape and attempted murder be able to enlist.  Because of the sensitive nature of domestic violence (Lautenburg) you will need to get all of your legal docs regarding that to verify you have a favorable disposition.  As long as you have no other pattern of arrests, you should be okay for a clearance.  A pattern of arrests, even if all are dismissed/not guilty you can have a clearance rejected because of whatever you were doing that was causing run ins with the law.  good luck.|`|owBi7hK4aa	Don't worry about it.  Just make sure your honest if given a background questionnaire.  You have a clean record as far as EVERYONE is concerned.|`|3824df9b033ecf684ecde9b040151b23aa	You probably won't know the answer to that until you've filled out your SF-86 (I'm PRETTY sure that's the right number for the form). Just make sure you're completely honest. I had a spot on my record (Class B Misdemeanor), and was still able to get my clearance. Whoever's processing your form will probably call you to clarify the details of the situation.<br>  <br>  And have fun as a 46Q/46R. your AIT's at Fort Meade! I don't know if they lengthened it or not since I was at Student Company for 25R training, but you should have about two-three months here. There's a fairly decent mall nearby, and the Greenbelt subway line will take you to DC. See the area, there's a lot of history here. Fells Point and Powerplant in Baltimore are also nice.<br>  <br>  Expect to go through the "phase" system at Student Company, too. You'll be on restriction for the first four weeks (Can go to the PX, still have to be in uniform, can't leave post), then you'll take a test that'll allow you to wear civilian clothes and go off-post. I think that lasts another four to six weeks, and then you'll get Phase 5A, which is where you can drink and smoke (if you're of age). It's a pretty easy time.

Last November my fiancé’s daughter was killed by a truck driver who crossed over into the oncoming lane and hit her and her fiancé head on. The truck driver was cited for not staying in his lane but the DA is investigating the accident to charge him with vehicular manslaughter. The truck driver had killed a family of 4 before and got away with it so the DA is doing what he can to get the SOB of the road. The DA has not completed the investigation and it has been 4 months since the accident. We also have our lawyer pressuring the DA for extra pressure. The family of the deceased person needs to pressure the DA to file charges. When the family does this the DA is obligated to investigate the incident, if the family does not pressure the DA the DA will figure no one cared to pursue the incident. Intent and malice are not the only consideration; gross negligence is a major factor in vehicular manslaughter.  Driving 100 MPH is gross negligence especially in urban, residential, congested or populated areas. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.heraldandnews.com/articles/2008/11/07/breaking/doc4911d6ecd4ee5529726458.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.heraldandnews.com/articles/20...</a>|`|3oNcHdgCaa	Beats me.<br>  I've heard of one case where somebody ran a stop sign and killed a pedestrian and got charged with vehicular manslaughter, and in another place a driver did the exact same thing and the cops there said "it was just an accident, what can we do?" and that driver didn't get criminally charged.|`|LoSXjaGXaa	Murder has to be intentional, otherwise it's manslaughter.|`|774dec04e838297da960dafa9c5bfe2aaa	It all really depends.

That is usually punishable by jail-time.|`|I12nj0M7aa	Manslaughter.|`|WkbuoG9Qaa	Well, to address the question of whether it is murder, the likely answer is no.  To be convicted of murder, one must illegally take the life of another with malicious intent.  When broken down, there are three elements right there: illegal taking of life, malice, and intent.<br>  <br>  Since, this was not war or a situation where it is legal to take the life of another, the death of the boy as a result of the driver does fulfill this element.  The driver is responsible for the illegal deprivation of the child's life.  However, there are two more elements to prove.<br>  <br>  Malice.  From the facts you gave, the driver of the race car did not possess the desire to bring the pain and suffering to the victims of the accident.  Unless the driver possessed the desire to bring pain and suffering to the victims, he does not fulfill this element of murder.<br>  <br>  Finally, there is the element of Intent.  Did the driver intend to commit the act in which he committed?  In this case, did the driver intend to crash his car into the victims?  For the facts you demonstrated, it is unlikely that the driver fulfills this element of murder, as well.<br>  <br>  Despite his criminal sentence, it is exceptionally likely that the man will be sued in civil court for negligence and wrongful death and the victims will be able to collect monetary damages for the injuries to the persons in the accident, the property damaged by the driver, and the life lost as a direct cause of the driver's actions.  It is likely that in an accident that devastating, the driver may be financially indebted to victims for the rest of his life.

QM2A6rBlaa	I do not think it is an ideological thing with many who oppose embryonic stem cell research, I think it is an "It wont work" thing.<br>  <br>  I have nothing but praise for the adult stem cell research being done, as it has had several very promasing breakthroughs. However even with all of the research being done in other countries, without any of the restrictions placed on it here, embryonic stem cell research has not had one indipendently verifiable breakthrough.<br>  <br>  I actually asked a question about it asking for proof and no one who supports it can deliver. I mean wouldn't you think that by now they would have been able to produce cells that don't mutate into cancer or disease? That is all they have to show for their efforts.<br>  <br>  Instead people who support it use emotions and hope to push it, but can't point to any actual success on it, at least not indipendent sources that have no interest in it.<br>  <br>  That is why I oppose it, because it has been long enough to see some posative results.|`|hhJrwRNdaa	Certainly that would be good.<br>  <br>  However if any funding is to be made it should be done where the Blue Collar worker is.

The question is, "whose ideology?"  Yours?  Mine?  The "majority of society"?  <br>  <br>  The difference between Obama's philosophy and Bush's philosophy is Bush based his decision (at least regarding stem-cell research funding) based on his professed religious convictions and political expediency...  while Obama has chosen to put science and the welfare of the American People above the political pressures applied by the religious right.<br>  <br>  I also disagree with your contention that the majority of Americans believe in Christian doctrines rather than science when the two are at odds.  Most Americans believe in science and the advancement of knowledge, particularly when those scientific applications will benefit millions of Americans and hundreds of millions in future generations and around the world.<br>  <br>  Having said that, I respect your right to have an opinion that differs from mine... but not your imagined right to impose your religious or anti-scientific views upon me or on all of society.<br>  <br>  ADDED:  After reading your note to me, I say "point taken."  You are right, you did not say anything about religion.  It can almost be assumed that your argument comes from religious beliefs though, since few people are against embrionic stem cell research without religion playing at least a small part, and usually a large part, of their reason for opposing it.<br>  <br>  I did refer to your "religious OR anti-scientific" views, however, since I recognized the possibility that you were making an argument from a non-religious viewpoint.  Even if you are not arguing from a religious viewpoint, 99.5 percent of the people who read this and comment in support of your opposition to embrionic stem cell research will be.<br>  <br>  I do respect your argument, and appreciate that it was presented intelligently and honestly (without reference to "murdering babies" or other such inflamatory language).  <br>  <br>  By the way, when I say "argument" I don't mean an antagonistic confrontation, but the other meaning for the word, which is a statement of reasons, or premises, to justify a position.|`|fbb4ab0738eb7d2ea8be8024fec8d32aaa	Lifting the ban on stem cell research was a nice little gesture, but that it all it was.<br>  During the time that stem cell research was curtailed, science moved forward to find the same benefits could be achieved WITHOUT using stem cells.<br>  Perhaps, without the ban, that technology would have not been developed.<br>  Yes, ideology plays heavily in ALL approaches, whether it is the ideology of the right or of the left.  Certainly, the theory of Global Warming, so embraced by the liberal left, is part of their belief.  There are others who are just as passionate against the idea of "global warming", believing instead in "earth cycles" as opposed to greenhouse gases.<br>  Global Warming spur the liberals on to try to cripple the coal, oil, and gas industries.  That is indeed an example of ideology molding policy and affecting funding.<br>  Science, itself, is an ideology.|`|o677X2DXaa	America , the alleged "leader of the free world", is quite lonely amongst its "constituency" of industrialized nations in its suspicion and outright rejection of science. While the Ugly Americans condemn Islamic nations for their alleged religious extremism, they continue to pit a mythological tale (which has no supporting evidence) against a scientific theory which can be traced back to Lamarck in 1809, has survived scientific scrutiny for almost two hundred years, and is accepted as valid by an overwhelming majority of scientists. A children's bedtime story called (ironically enough) Intelligent Design, is slowly making its way into the US public school system. I need some clarification now. Who is under the influence of powerful religious extremists?|`|UpZFb6X5aa	For two reasons. First, science is about determining facts, not about values or opinions.<br>  <br>  Second, EVERY person who wants to use their ideology to censor scientific research is doing so for the sole purpose of stripping people of their right to speak and write freely.

I also wonder how many companies will enjoy the funding, even though they claim Obama is going to take their money in taxes?<br>  <br>  Second, I am a true believer that God should have no place in our government.  I don't like how we argue on abortion or stem cell research with the ideas of religious ideology or morality when this is not what our government is supposed to be about.  The US is NOT a Christian state nor is it a religious state.  We're supposed to be the country where people can practice any religion they want as long as it doesn't harm people.<br>  <br>  I understand when the ideologists want to ban abortion and stem cell research because they think it's immoral.  They have a right to speak, but I am all for less babies in this world that end up on welfare or abandoned, and I am for curing cancer and other ailments.  I am going to get my wisdom teeth pulled soon, and I'm donating them to research because they can get stem cells out of them.<br>  <br>  If there was a better way to get stem cells that don't involve embryos then let's do it.

That just screams abuse of power to me.<br>  <br>  For the record, I am against the idea of embryonic stem cell research since there are other avenues of investigating stem cell pluripotency control.  Go figure lol..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  To those rating me down, do you really feel so aligned to a political party that you are willing to follow heavily edited reports that conflict with the original report's actual conclusions?|`|MqXbtvP9aa	because science trumps fiction|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	Yes, ideology should have a role.<br>  <br>  Joseph Mengele's experiments were "science" without any moral or ethical limits whatsoever.<br>  <br>  They were monstrous.<br>  <br>  Also, many have argued that "The Bell Curve" presents scientific findings regarding race and intelligence, but I would much rather live in a society governed by Martin Luther King's moral and religious teachings that people should be judged not on the color of their skin but on the content of their character.<br>  <br>  I have no problem being with the "unscientific dullards" at times!<br>  <br>  PS  Yes, Obama is using a rhetorical trick.

Let the illegals protest...round them up and ship them out.<br>  <br>  I'm of the mind the government should be able to take away business licenses for any company that employs a large percentage of illegals.  Make it hurt businesses who employ illegals and thus force them to employ Americans.  They should also give companies a tax credit for every American citizen they employ.<br>  <br>  "Jobs Americans don't want".  I'll bet plenty would want them if they paid decently in this economy.  Plenty of unemployed right now to choose from.|`|yk9xwLwNaa	No - didn't you hear Robert Reich - he said to make sure that no jobs for white males were in the 'stimulus' bill. They keep trying to get rid of e-verify.<br>  <br>  These people who cause problems are not the ones to solve them.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	No, I bet they won't.  For one thing, even though many people say they will take any job, they really won't.  An IT person is unlikely to take a construction job.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I knew that was coming. He will probably legalize them anyway and give them free health care & social security.|`|zNB3tZXraa	Government and diligent are a contradiction of terms, and should not be used in the same sentence. Illegals make up 15% of the work force, there is no reason to believe they will not wind up on these projects.|`|xagiOb80aa	You should be blaming those precious "small businesses" and other companies that illegally give these jobs away.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	Then they obviously have some nice fake identification since they have to fill out the I9.<br>  <br>  Are you in the construction field?|`|rrSaoOK2aa	The intent is to give jobs to illegals who will vote for Dems in the future.|`|GgZ8kXMFaa	I hadn't heard/seen that, but NO, I am sure that the government will not be diligent in any sense. <br>  <br>  As a construction company owner, we do our best hire legal employees.  The government has a program for companies to check the employment status of new hires based upon their I9.  Granted, they could provide false information on their I9, but I feel that it is the responsibility of EVERY company hiring to use this.  It is linked to the Social Security Administration, and can help to verify that the name, address, date of birth and other Information matches the I9 Documents (license, social security card, passport, etc.) and is are accurate.<br>  <br>  The only downfall to this, is that nothing is done if the information cannot be verified.|`|Jlcu7kQNaa	Of course not, but you knew that already.<br>  <br>  <br>  Healthy Person------------<br>    Alot of money is being wasted in Iraq, but if you knew anything about economics, you would also know that most of the money ILLEGALS make, go home to their country. That is why it is Mexico's second largest income producer. <br>  Once again, someone who doesn't let facts get in the way of their ranting.|`|hhJrwRNdaa	If they do away with the Welfare Program Americans that are able to work who are on it will get up off their lazy cans and take the jobs if they wanted to eat.<br>  <br>  If Congress enacted a bill to this effect the US would have a black uprising like it has never seen before.|`|AA10681117	Is it the governments job to check and see who is hired and how? I would argue this is the job of the company doing the hiring.|`|MM8rqTMtaa	Oversight?  Not a chance.  The same thing that happened when Congress gave Wall Street and the banking industry all of that money just as fast as they could without any hooks will happen with these construction jobs.|`|2CO7pPdoaa	not under the "Obamanator" they won't, he'll give them more free housing, education, health care, welfare checks and won't charge them a dime...then after we've spent billions caring for them, he'll give amnesty...|`|7UqccTp6aa	No. They had the opportunity to make employers responsible for that but, Obama decided to omit it.|`|XsPo8rm7aa	In a word, NO.

Later neoclassical changes were added. <br>  <br>  The original architect was Irish born and they do not have plantations in Ireland. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://architecture.about.com/od/housetours/ss/whitehouse.htm" rel="nofollow">http://architecture.about.com/od/houseto...</a><br>  <br>  At George Washington's suggestion, Irish-born architect James Hoban traveled to the federal capital and submitted a plan for the presidential home. <br>  <br>  Eight other architects also submitted designs, but Hoban won. The "White House" proposed by Hoban was a refined Georgian mansion in the Palladian style. Built of pale gray sandstone, it would have three floors and more than 100 rooms.<br>  <br>  Lastly, it's important to note that the White house contains more than just living quarters.  It also contains offices, ball rooms for entertaining foreign dignitaries, and meeting rooms.|`|EOhxXxM9aa	Simply consider when it was built.<br>  <br>  BTW--why would you want to change a building that is recognizable around the world?Except maybe to put some solar panels to power it.|`|AWSmknxLaa	Nobody ever said it was suppose to look like an American Homes.<br>  <br>  It is fine just as it is.|`|TYGgRjqDaa	So what do you propose?  I'm sure everyone would be thrilled to see our tax dollars revamp the White House during these tough economic times.|`|nYjVW8Fbaa	I'm not an obama or a bush supporter,,,,, but so many people here are so bias on whatever side they support,,,, notice I did not say views,,,, that I'm convinced ignorance should be a crime.|`|b32jC7pGaa	Who ever said it was to represent American homes?

We're getting to paint a picture of a disorganized GOP that's letting a radio pundit rule the partisan politics.|`|NaYoqWBOaa	Nope,sorry.|`|sLn5BivGaa	That's a good a theory as any.  Republicans need to realize that Rush is just "in it" for the benefit of Rush, and the party be damned.

If it generates attention then he will chose that route.|`|9dEotvVwaa	Even if Rush did trash Newt it would be because Newt didn't back conservative principals.  That is the thing about Rush, he doesn't keep any favorites.  If you go against his beliefs and morals he will call you on it, Democrat or Republican.<br>  <br>  This is called "VALUES" all you Dems who think this is unusual.  Values are what you have that you hold dear to, and you don't shift with the direction of the political wind.  That is what makes Rush so popular, he holds true to his values.|`|ZHfR1lPkaa	Rush needs to back down, It seems he is feeling like the messiah lately.<br>  If he keeps this up even some of most staunch supporters will desert him.<br>  <br>  READ MY LIPS SHUT UP RUSH you are killing your party.<br>  <br>  Neo cons are as blind as neo socialists|`|gdU86jYWaa	I did not know there was anything good to say about Newt.|`|k6hicodfaa	Rush cares more about his wallet than the GOP.|`|K1iUzewyaa	ha.. typical Obamabots.. Rush just said something to the effect of how Newt called Rush out on wanting O's policies to fail.. But then he went on to talk about how kool aid drinkers are getting upset and saying how Rush is irrelevant, when at the same time, Obama, and every liberal is talking about him.. If he wasn't relevant, sure wouldn't be all this talk about him, would there?|`|fUh7LHzvaa	Rush Limbaugh is a big fat idiot, who cares what he says.|`|cr5EoqVjaa	Use both ears.

qQEl7Fukaa	Yes I have been financially Obamized. Not the sort of simplicity I need, except that voting will be much simpler from now on.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	No, my finances, especially my 401k,  fell victim to Bushonomics.  I have since moved to more secure investments.|`|G4Y96LGqaa	Obama spent 3 to 1 more in 6 weeks than Bush did in 8 Years, with two wars and 9/11. Now the Democrap Congress just passed another 410 billion in porklous spending with 8500 in earmarks! <br>  <br>  We have been officially Obmatized! I wonder if we can get away with being Geitner-tized now?|`|NIHXUmN1aa	Being a very conservative republican I almost (almost) feel guilty shorting the market but also being an Ivy league educated (Cornell '88) econ grad and having read much of obama's writings and stated positions I just could see no way the market/economy would flourish under his presidency. I have been shorting the market heavily since he was elected and have made almost $300K in just 4 months. I wouldn't be surprised to see the dow get back into the low thousands, like 3 or 4,000. I just hope there is some America left for me to spend my money on.|`|9dEotvVwaa	It is much simpler when it comes to trying to figure out what the government is going to do.

qQEl7Fukaa	Some have concluded that Presidents age twice as quickly while in office. In Obama's case I think his presidency is causing me to age faster than he is.|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	No.  Maybe two months for every month in office.|`|mNC4r3EIaa	Maybe your calculations are a bit off, lol. But he will age a lot faster of course, and it doesn't help that he smokes.|`|fPMVuB87aa	ohh, you mean president years like dog years, nay|`|LMPK5WBaaa	I have noticed that he always looks so tired... <br>  <br>  I agree he has alot on his plate... but the first mistake he made was making all those promises that he knew he couldn't keep...

Please correct me if I am wrong maybe I am reading the chart wrong. Either way I am a member of the Constitution Party and could care less about Rush. Just because others spent uncontrollably doesn't make it right.|`|8ReUKb7Baa	I have to say i don't know who your talking about.... but i am sure<br>  unless under a rock , most Americans know exactly whom you<br>  are talking about.<br>  <br>  Having said that, let me say this..... i think no one has picked him<br>  up on what your saying or pretending they have not.....

What do you think is going to pay for all these programs BO has in his big spending bill?  TAXPAYERS!!!!!  That is what Rush is refering to.  They are not going to pay for themselves.|`|UpZFb6X5aa	Because everyone knows Limbaugh is a liar. He's not important enough to be worth the trouble of "challenging."|`|AA10096992	To do so would be to imply that Rush ever gets anything right.|`|2CO7pPdoaa	looks like ya missed it...|`|Rh5b4R5Iaa	Dude- the entire National Debt right now stands at 9 trillion dollars which negates your Bush and Reagan figures in one swipe. Your entire question is based upon false premises. And Rush is right- Obama has proposed the most spending ever by any single President.|`|7M0KW1Iwaa	Because the only people who care about that are Dems looking for another distraction away from their failing leader's policies.|`|lwccQoEZaa	Didn't hear it, didn't watch the thing but if he was wrong call his show and take it up with him. Please Get over this Rush "thing"|`|CM1dfztQaa	What part don't you understand? You listed the TOTAL spending budget for two other presidents, and neither one was close to that. Look at your own numbers. Why would anyone waste their time on supplying numbers to you when you don't even understand the ones you've supplied to us.<br>  <br>  The numbers you gave for Bush and Reagan were for their entire presidency. Obama has already beat their numbers and we still have 4 more years of his spending to look forward to. Do you really think he isn't going to spend anymore after this? He's acting like a college student who was just given free reign over daddy's credit card. I would say that makes for a huge difference in the way he is spending vs. the way his predecessors have.<br>  <br>  I know you like the guy, but facts are facts. You can argue them til your blue in the face, but it doesn't make them less true, and being antagonistic doesn't win arguments either, it just makes you look obnoxious.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Wildly?  Why are we analyzing what Rush says?  We need to analyze what Obama is doing!<br>  <br>  But if you really want to do that, you first must understand what the budget, debt, and deficits mean.  People are prone to lump debt and deficit together.  The gov't does not account the way you do your checkbook.<br>  <br>  Because you seem interested in actually learning and reading, unlike many people who just spout off, I found an excellent website for you.  This explains it in easier terms than most do.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Why would anyone need to defend or challenge an entertainer?<br>  <br>  It isn't like he is pretending to be a news source like the staff of the NY Times.|`|THNvhp3Caa	After 20 years, I take it for granted that if Rush's lips are moving, lies are pouring forth.|`|gdU86jYWaa	Like all those of far right media they claim they we "misquoted."|`|AA10264185	He also said that the Preamble to the Constitution guarantees life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This at a convention of core conservatives, who purport to be supporters of strict interpretation of the Constitution. Conservatives and the followers of their leader, Rush Limbaugh, never let facts get in their way.<br>  I'm sure that all these people who say that liberals should stop worrying about what Rush has to say, never raised any objections to Michael Moore during the Bush administration, either.
1ce25e71aa4dd2eb1e82121617a06b87aa	All I know is that:<br>  <br>  Obama is failing. He is like a caged animal. He is going nuts. He is aging one year every month. He has to get on a plane and get out of Dodge to get breathing space. <br>  <br>  America will succeed, with or without Obama.|`|kZeu2Dyzaa	Democrat Definition of Success:<br>  Run a business that spends more than it makes and then get government money to make up the shortfall.<br>  <br>  Democrat Definition of Failure:<br>  Run a business that makes more than it spends which means that you don't get anything for free and you have to pay taxes.|`|DB7UMkGCaa	If it moves, tax it.

fUh7LHzvaa	A DAY IN THE LIFE OF JOE REPUBLICAN<br>  <br>  Joe gets up at 6 a.m. and fills his coffeepot with water to prepare his morning coffee. The water is clean and good because some tree-hugging liberal fought for minimum water-quality standards. With his first swallow of water, he takes his daily medication. His medications are safe to take because some stupid commie liberal fought to insure their safety and that they work as advertised. All but $10 of his medications are paid for by his employer's medical plan because some liberal union workers fought their employers for paid medical insurance - now Joe gets it too. He prepares his morning breakfast, bacon and eggs. Joe's bacon is safe to eat because some girly-man liberal fought for laws to regulate the meat packing industry.<br>  <br>  In the morning shower, Joe reaches for his shampoo. His bottle is properly labeled with each ingredient and its amount in the total contents because some crybaby liberal fought for his right to know what he was putting on his body and how much it contained. Joe dresses, walks outside and takes a deep breath. The air he breathes is clean because some environmentalist wacko liberal fought for laws to stop industries from polluting our air. He walks to the subway station for his government-subsidized ride to work. It saves him considerable money in parking and transportation fees because some fancy-pants liberal fought for affordable public transportation, which gives everyone the opportunity to be a contributor.<br>  <br>  Joe begins his work day. He has a good job with excellent pay, medical benefits, retirement, paid holidays and vacation because some lazy liberal union members fought and died for these working standards. Joe's employer pays these standards because Joe's employer doesn't want his employees to call the union. If Joe is hurt on the job or becomes unemployed, he'll get a worker compensation or unemployment check because some stupid liberal didn't think he should lose his home because of his temporary misfortune.<br>  <br>  It's noontime and Joe needs to make a bank deposit so he can pay some bills. Joe's deposit is federally insured by the FSLIC because some godless liberal wanted to protect Joe's money from unscrupulous bankers who ruined the banking system before the Great Depression. Joe has to pay his Fannie Mae-underwritten mortgage and his below-market federal student loan because some elitist liberal decided that Joe and the government would be better off if he was educated and earned more money over his lifetime.<br>  <br>  Joe is home from work. He plans to visit his father this evening at his farm home in the country. He gets in his car for the drive. His car is among the safest in the world because some America-hating liberal fought for car safety standards. He arrives at his boyhood home. His was the third generation to live in the house financed by Farmers' Home Administration because bankers didn't want to make rural loans. The house didn't have electricity until some big-government liberal stuck his nose where it didn't belong and demanded rural electrification.<br>  <br>  He is happy to see his father, who is now retired. His father lives on Social Security and a union pension because some wine-drinking, cheese-eating liberal made sure he could take care of himself so Joe wouldn't have to.<br>  <br>  Joe gets back in his car for the ride home, and turns on a radio talk show. The radio host keeps saying that liberals are bad and conservatives are good.

Unfortunately, those things did happen, so now we must try to learn from it so it never happens again.<br>  <br>  I don't, however, think likening the holocaust and slavery to abortion is warranted. I feel a woman should have the choice to decide what is best for her situation. You should never judge someone unless you've walked a mile in their shoes. <br>  <br>  Sometimes, abortion is a life or death decision for the mother. If I was told that carrying and/or delivering a child would cause my own death, I would probably have second thoughts on bringing the child into the world. If I became pregnant after being brutalized and raped, I may not want that child inside of me. Many women have experienced that, and to tell them what they are doing is wrong, is not for you or me to decide.<br>  <br>  I, personally, am not able to have children, but I don't like to judge anyone's situation.|`|k6hicodfaa	One can also liken having women carry pregnancy to term against their will for whatever reason to be a form of slavery.

I think the answer was quite clear, and the historical record has shown time and again, that when the military-industrial complex is made stronger, inexplicable wars break out, and the men behind such complexes grow very wealthy in a very short period of time. In this case, although Dick Cheney was no longer the CEO of Haliburton and it's subsidiaries (KBR), he was, and still is, the single largest individual holder of PREFERRED shares. Now that KBR has broken free from Haliburton, huge swaths of it's stock has been sold off by "someone" after the preferred shares had been issued to Haliburton shareholders. Odd? Me thinks not, because an almost identical number of preferred shares of Haliburton stocks were also sold in the same time frame. If one were to look at the face of it, it would be easily explained away.

This was supercharged under Bill Clinton, who wanted to increase home ownership to more minorities, by lowering borrowing standards. He also got the HUD secretary to involve Fannie and Freddie in making subprime loans. Countrywide took advantage of this by writing thousands of loans that they knew would not be paid, but they sold them to Fannie and Freddie. Countrywide had the help of Chris Dodd, Barney Frank and other banking regulators, as well as pressure from Acorn and the National Black caucus.

If the price of wheat dropped this dramatically, other products (complimentary products like flour for example, and the complimentary products made from flour) would also drop...not as dramatically, but the demand and prices would drop as well...<br>  <br>  This is of course just a hypothetical example, but it does illustrate how one specific product can have a dramatic effect on the whole economy.  This is why the government subsidizes the farming industry to not produce certain foods at certain times.<br>  <br>  Here's a reasonable explanation found on wikipedia:<br>  <br>  Some proponents of agricultural subsidies argue that they are necessary because of the fluctuating nature of agriculture. Domestic crop yield can fluctuate considerably depending on the local weather. International crop supply and prices also fluctuate considerably depending on weather (eg, drought in Australia), politics (eg farm seizures in Zimbabwe), war, and other factors affecting crop yields in foreign countries. As a result of these fluctuations in production levels and prices, there could be very large variations in farm revenues and food available for purchase on the global market. Price support and income guarantees can help to maintain a strong domestic farm sector and domestic food supply, by smoothing farmers' income over time and better ensure that farmers are not required to maintain a hefty float from year to year in order to maintain a consistent income.<br>  <br>  Farm subsidies have the effect of transferring income from the general tax payers to farm owners. It is argued in some countries that without support from government, domestic farmers would not be able to compete with foreign imports. Removing subsidies would therefore drive domestic farmers out of business, leaving the country with a much smaller (or possibly non existent) agriculture industry. A country that is unable to domestically produce enough food to feed its people is at the mercy of the world market, and is more vulnerable to trade pressure and global food shortages and price shocks. The loss of the domestic farming industry is also often seen as undesirable on a variety of grounds, including increases in (short term) unemployment, and the loss of a traditional cultural way of life.<br>  <br>  Depending on the nature of the subsidies, agricultural subsidies may have the effect of increasing agricultural production and/or driving down domestic food prices. This means domestic producers and consumers would pay less for their food. Compared with wealthier individuals, poor people generally pay a smaller proportion of their income in taxes, and they generally spend a larger proportion of their income on food. Thus lower food prices, financed through tax revenues, will provide larger benefits for the poor than for the wealthy. In this respect, agriculture subsidies could be considered an indirect means of transferring wealth to lower income individuals.<br>  <br>  Agricultural subsidies, resulting in lower food prices, and domestic overproduction, can also provide benefits for the poor in other ways. In the 1960s, President Lyndon B. Johnson made food surpluses a weapon in the war on poverty. Since then, food has been donated to poor urban areas in the United States. Also, both critics and proponents of the WTO have noted that export subsidies, by driving down the price of commodities, can provide cheap food for consumers in developing countries.[5][6]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultura...</a>|`|fPMVuB87aa	Nice Q Chi Guy, I was watching a report about that in 20/20, pretty controversial.|`|bkav003oaa	Because agri - businesses have a lot of money.|`|ab406a9a5d69ca0d2cc95e30217f543aaa	Theoretically, if there is too much green beans out there, and green bean growers can't sell their product because all the buyers have all they need, and my land is only good for green beans, then the government might pay me not to flood the market and make the market worse.<br>  <br>  I don't know if this happens any more.

I think that he really energized a group of voters who really hadn't been energized for some time. I honestly think he added a lot to the debate, I thought that watching him spar during the Republican debates with Huckabee, Giuliani, and McCain on the war was always interesting to see and really made the other candidates defend their positions. I think he should stay active, I think he should do what he can to keep in contact with his supporters, and he should really do his best to make himself a strong voice in the Republican Party, because the Republican Party is split ideologically and geographically in a way it hasn't been since 1964. There is no real heir apparent, the Reagan coalition is fractured, and I really do think that there is going to be a debate between all the ideological and geographical elements of the Republican Party, and that Paul has the credibility, at least, to get himself a seat at the table. Impressively, he scored I think third in the CPAC poll, with about 13%, well above people like Huckabee and Palin. You know, were he 10 or 15 years younger, I could easily see him mounting another Presidential campaign, but, I think regardless of whether he chooses to run again or not, he has the potential to be a powerful voice in the future of the Republican party, which I expect to endure a bloody primary and debate about its direction for the future come 2012.
AA12349988	I think red nose day will be fine due to the fact it is a one off shown on a Friday night with more people staying in and drinking.<br>  <br>  It is the regular donations to smaller charities that are suffering.|`|eulMjLtPaa	It already has.  Charities have noticed a drop in donations.|`|LLeQyWGcaa	yep. there are many out there struggling and can't see donating money to what ever cause when they need that money to keep themselves a float. It's a shame but hard times hits one and all.|`|ujIinLzGaa	It has certainly affected my donations.

It might go down because my income is down.<br>  <br>  DTG|`|LBB9B8mFaa	Mr sceptic is right and a lot of these charities nowadays are politically correct in their outlook and have incorporated promoting liberalism into their remits instead of real help. (for instance the NSPCC concentrating on criminalising all smacking from decent parents instead of fighting real child abuse). I give to small charities whose management and advertising costs are not astronomical and who don't cold call you like Christian Aid. I don't like self congratulatory, media hyped charity giving like Mr sceptic|`|9dEotvVwaa	Not only will the recession affect charities, but OBAMA Policies are as well.  Obama is removing the charitable contribution tax deduction from "Wealthy" americans.  In other words if you are wealthy we don't want you giving to charity.  Now how hypocritical is that?  Why would you discourage charitable donations?|`|U8XTbQgraa	If people really have any spare cash i never understand why they give it up to watch a few a people on the TV who then decide for you where it goes.Myself i choose my own charities thanks.I do not need a lot of buffoons on TV telling me they want my money and giving it to their chosen charity.It always seems like another Tax gathering exercise to me.<br>  I also like to make sure my money is going to help those that genuinely need it.Because charity is such big business and a Tax free haven you would be suprised how many scam huge livings of these donations.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	The only thing that will hurt charitable contributions is Obama taking away the ability to claim such contributions. That is purely evil on his part.|`|09aGRz8paa	i still give to the charities that i normally give to.|`|xXEFvl8Naa	yes but surprisingly it tends to be the more wealthy who reduce their donations the most.|`|FfPUhCuiaa	It already is.|`|AA10119874	Yes, it is.

23bgwpD1aa	Who would benefit from the levees being blown up? Not the government, but some of those people who lived there came out of the that ordeal quite well.|`|5Ho518J9aa	Yes. "Heck of a job, Brownie!" Comes to mind. For the cheap seats, I don't think Bush had the levees blown up. The fact is, however, that FEMA director Brown's handling of the situation clues us in to the way they plan on handling large scale disasters, and to me, in retrospect, it looked almost like a training mission. The ppor were lined up, locked into the Superdome, and left to fend for themselves. The law-abiding civilian populace was disarmed because desperate folks surrounded by floodwaters tried to hail passing Blackhawk helicopters with gunfire. I saw numerous pieces of news footage showing armed law enforcement officers ignoring the looters, yet they managed to round up the weapons from those who would protect themselves from said looters. Nice. At the same time, they NEVER attempted to go into the SuperDome and rescue the poor, until everything else was done. If this is what they have planneds for the next emergency, be it a "terrorist" attack or a natural disaster, or the inevitable economic collapse, we are in for a rude awakening.

Did ya notice that 9/11 and all the Florida hurricanes were taken care of locally?|`|2b7VqUXXaa	Katrina was a natural disaster; the Federal Government can’t step in until asked to do so by the Governor of the state. In this case, Kathleen Blanco, the democratic governor of Louisiana wouldn’t let FEMA act until it was too late.  Bush got blamed for this because he was the president, not because he did anything wrong.|`|v8elYTNxaa	Dems never said "Bush blew up the levees".  How can you lie not only to us, but to yourself in such a way?  By the way, Bush's response to Katrina was irresponsible, slow and ultimately disgusting.<br>  <br>  Remember when he was leaving office, telling us what he'd have done differently?<br>  <br>  "We couldn;t land the plane".

5Ho518J9aa	Gypsy, I whole-heartedly agree. I think if we all did in politics what we do in every other facet of our lives, we'd be better off. We don't holler at each other on the job, right? When our Pastor says something we disagree with we don't call him a racist or a commie, do we? No, we always step over to the side, and talk it out. I can't tell you how many times I've had to sit down with my old boss and hash out our differences. Where there times when it was heated or driven by anger? Sure! but we were always respectful. In Church, there have been times when the preacher said something I thought was a misinterperetation of the Scripture, and I met with him over coffee and discussed it rationally and referred back to the chapter and didn't just quote one little verse, but the whole chapter, so as not to take it out of context. You see, that's what hasn't been done. We have been led around like sheep by the two parties, and pitted against one another in a red/blue dogfight that never ends. Why do you think Rush Limbaugh and Keith Olberman and Sean Hannity and Rachel Maddow have so many listeners and viewers? They DIRECTLY oppose one another, and it's no accident.|`|m5J36D28aa	Great idea, I'm all for everyone thinking for themselves, instead of aligning with a badly led party.

I believe that they were to busy getting rich to care.

I thought then, "Man, why do so many people get into this pompous ***, not to mention the fact he's a bit of a racist."<br>  <br>  So maybe my interest does border on fascination.

For some reason they think by belittling Rush by remarking on his weight and his past addiction to pain killers it will diminish our opinion of him. but it;s not working. and if they will remember barry admitted his cocaine habit plus his cigarette habits but the democrats still say no he didn;t. so are you admitting barry is a liar?He said he gave up cigerettes which turned out to be a lie so what about his cocaine addiction can you say you know he gave that up? no you can"t.<br>  the old saying sweep off your back porch before talking about the others goes with you. everytime you open your mouth to criticize someone we have one up on you with Barrys many past bad {to use a simple word} things he has done.

ipWRgKetaa	Regulations are there to protect folks like you from the big bad scary man. Regulations are there to help keep you from doing something stupid. Regulations are there because you are not capable of being responsible for your actions and as a result, someone needs to look out for you. How about you slip on the Big Girl Pants and start taking responsibility for yourself and being personally accountable for your mistakes and bad judgment. Wouldn't that be a refreshing change! <br>  <br>  Look, greed not withstanding, if you need protection from the big bad scary man, why don't you just move back in with Mommy and Daddy.

This in turn means that when we do have a recession we dump a lot more jobs than we would have had they gone under when they were supposed to. As you well know, unemployment further delays economic recovery. Essentially, more regulation = more recessions, larger recessions, and slower recovery from recessions.<br>  <br>  Also, please note that there is a huge difference between regulation and consumer protections...|`|sKXzYvaRaa	Well, I think you have it backwards.

I think I speak for a lot of political conservatives, when I say that some regulation is necessary and appropriate for a sense of fair play among all the players.  However, I do think it needs to be minimized because too often, what is often a well-intended policy turns highly bureaucratic and then the regulations take over and prevent companies from focusing on what they need to focus on - free trade and a moving economy that benefits all.  When reporting to the government becomes your primary activity something is wrong.<br>  <br>  While I see your point about greed, I always remember in a macroeconomics class in college when we looked at a graph of how price ceilings and floors sometimes cause a market to operate inefficiently.

5COJmUOWaa	Your question is much too logical to be taken seriously here.<br>  <br>  There are numerous ways to reform healthcare.  The German model uses private, for profit health insurers who are subject to government regulations that prohibit them from denying coverage bases on pre-existing conditions.  So their system is more of a hybrid than other European single payer systems, ranging from this to the British system of socialized medicine where the doctors work for the government to the French system of private doctors but with a single payer system.<br>  The big difference, or course, is that the United States has allowed the medical profession to become a for profit system.  The free market zealots think this is just fine but the fact is that by allowing the profit motive into this basic human need they are ruining our economy.<br>  Soon the portion of our incomes that the health care system demands of us will exceed our ability to pay and we will essentially be working in exchange for healthcare.  Economic slavery anyone?<br>  <br>  But consider this.  If we should end up with a single payer system it will spell the end of our economy unless Obama can muster the courage and ammunition to stop the insane prices that the healthcare profession charges us for their services.  A single payer system without removing these criminally high prices will create a Bubble that will dwaft even the housing bubble.  Close your eyes and try to imagine just how raped and robbed we will be when every person in the country can get medical care that is subsidized by the government with the greedy sons of dogs in the healthcare business charging $235.00 for an aspirin.<br>  And to the free maketers who claim that a single payer system with price controls won't work, I remind them of Vlad Lenin.  Vlad pulled a 38 caliber pistol from his pocket and put it to the head of a train conductor refusing to run the train.  Vlad cocked the pistol and Mr. Conductor yelled, "All Aboard!"

First, the patient doesn't care how much a procedure costs because he is not paying the premium.  Second, the insurer isn't directly accountable to the patient because someone else is paying the bill.

If you have diabetes, asthma, heart disease, etc, you also need to control your eating and exercise habits, along with environment (asthma).

Does that only apply to Republicans?|`|Rh5b4R5Iaa	Obama is a Liberal Democrat. Much like Bill Clinton only MORE Liberal. The only thing those people care about is their own selfish image. They care nothing about America or it's people. The last person to actually care just left office.|`|jDgoqQeVaa	No, he doesn't.  Funny that over a third of my militia are blacks and latinos.  Seems everyone in my area can smell the danger.|`|AA10380060	i guess you have never lost any one close to you who could have been saved by stem cell procedures.<br>  <br>  let me tell you my story, in october of 2007 my fiance and i got married and it was the happiest day of our lives. we looked forward to the lifetime we would be spending together. the holidays anniverserys etc etc. and my wife was a sensitive sweet girl who loved animals and treated our 5 cats like they were children. she was always waiting at the door holding one of our cats every day when i came home from work to greet and in one of the voices that she had given our cats she would hold the cat up and say "me and mommy missed you daddy". i sometimes hated to even go down to the store if she wasn't by my side. then in the summer of 2008, my wife became ill. when i was finally able to get her to a hospital in september she was diagnosed with liver failure. her mother and i were told that she could improve with time and treatment but if she didn't a transplant was her only hope of survival, and if you don't know how that works most people with liver failure die long before they receive a transplant. the next six weeks i was with my wife in the hospital. praying, reading to her, crying when she wasn't looking because i didn't want her to know that i was weak when i was trying to give her strength. whenever i could find maybe that spare hour or 2 of time i would research what i could in hopes of finding something that could save her. I found out that with stem cell therapy someone with even the worst liver disease could be treated without a full liver transplant ( a procedure in which most patients only live another 18 months after recieving it also costs about $12,000 a year for the medicine the patient must recieve in order for them to not have their body reject the donor organ.) the stem cell therapy however is not available in the united states. 6 weeks after being admitted just 3 weeks after her 28th birthday and the day right after our first anniversery my beloved wife who is the center of my world passed away. every day since i have woken up and realized she is not here with me and I myself cannot wait for my own death so I can be with her again.<br>  <br>  and W's lackeys talk all this bs about taxpayers shouldn't pay for the destruction of life??? excuse me but how much is the not one but 2 WARS costing the taxpayers (no they ain't playing laser tag over there)??? and what about my wife's life huh? is it selfish to think she should have lived knowing that she could have been saved if we would have had stem cell research in the land of LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS EIGHT YEARS AGO!!! come on tell me thats selfish and tell every parent who has lost their child in Iraq that that was for freedom. tell everyone who lost their job in the past 2 years that we needed his war. it seems as Bush was just as much for large pharmacuetical companies who made large profits off of anti rejection drugs as what he was big oil. And he claims all this morale nonsense, tell me is waging a war in a country that we shouldn't even give a crap about is that God's work? yes Bush was all about God, the one known as the almighty dollar.<br>  <br>  yes Obama does care about America, beings that America is WE THE PEOPLE, not we the oil companies|`|0nZHAaQDaa	He cares in a negative way, just like his whole 2 yrs. in the senate was a stepping stone to the Presidency, he views the Office of President of the U.S. as a stepping stone towards his ultimate goal, a new world order with himself as the first President for Life of the World|`|gT3v7A1paa	Would you like some cheese with your whine?|`|k6hicodfaa	Yes.  And I do wish people who actually research before they post a pundit's thoughts.<br>  <br>  For example, your point about federally funded abortions is simply a non-truth.  Having worked with women's based groups post the W. legislation many groups lost funding if their parent organization performed abortion.  For example, APROFAM in Guatemala lost funding because it was a branch of Planned Parenthood.  Now APROFAM simply taught effective and cost effective family planning and had no abortion platform as abortion is illegal in Guatemala.|`|EPObVPzVaa	These sweeping changes at the very foundation of who and what we are is devastating.<br>  <br>  He's only in office for a couple of months and it will take decades to un-do it all.<br>  <br>  It always takes longer to fix something than it does to break it.|`|4qnXCxlHaa	When you think that selling America to the oil companies is a great idea, then you probably will think Obama is the worst.<br>  <br>  We just got out of the worst presidency in American history.<br>  <br>  Things can only get better.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	I think he is screwing up big time.

KDxTxhXHaa	The poster above said some hospitals are losing money.  Well I have never seen a poor doctor and we all know the drug companies and insurance companies aren't poor.  I have no clue what we would should do about the parasites, but it would be nice if something was done.<br>  Too bad we can't go back to simpler times when people actually cared about one another and would help their neighbor out.  It seems that everything has become about money.  So when your life ends you can announce that you were rich and not that you truly helped out your fellow man.  I bet that gets you real big points with the Man upstairs.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Did you know most hospitals are losing money?<br>  <br>  Yes I think you should be the first to pull out a gun & start your little revolution. Let us know how it went.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	A local hospital was recently forced to close for a month, the reason?<br>  The biggest insurance company told the hospital what it must accept in payment and the hospital refused to accept it.<br>  WOW...the insurance company as Lenin, only they did it in the name of their own profits, a capitalist idea if ever there was one.<br>  The way the insurance companies etal give up is if they don't make money, but they can and are controlled by negotiations, ask almost any other country, their pharmaceutical costs are lower than ours because its negotiated.  Drug companies would rather make ten percent markup than not be able to sell their drugs at all.<br>  And the same would serve for the rest of the list.<br>  Doctors are even going over to the single payer system, they aren't happy about having to hire staff just to take care of insurance or the fact that they can't treat patients they've treated for years when the patients insurance plan changes.<br>  You can't look to neighbors for help when you need a heart valve replacement, its well into the tens of thousands of dollars, in the fifties and sixties about all you could do in a hospital was die, the first open heart surgery was done in 1966, we are paying for the tremendous advances in treatment.  It costs big time.|`|fUh7LHzvaa	The President is not even pushing for a single payer system, so no matter what...we are still going to pay for extremely high medical bills, either through government or out of our pockets. This is the reality. Until we adopt a system similar to other modern industrialized countries, we are going to continue spiraling to the bottom.|`|5syj6Uzaaa	You refer to a "free Society" in a question.  Your next statement then is of using the threat of violence to achieve an aim.  Do you realize the dissonance presented?<br>  <br>  Good luck trying to centrally plan society.  Given that I presume you are a person of little influence, I am willing to grant that you are guided by good intentions.  Take thought for a moment.  People like Lenin did (and do) not operate only upon their personal use of force.  They command armies.  While it may seem to you that those armies can be powerful tools for good, can you perceive the value that they pose to would-be tyrants?  How do you propose to keep your mechanisms for good out of those hands?<br>  <br>  Even supposing that you manage to keep your benevolent dictatorship [1], upon what basis do you intend to plan?  Your question implies a desire to fix prices, that the prices demanded by medical providers are too high.  I agree that they are too high.  Consider that health care is already provided in an environment that is far from free.  Making it less so is not likely to improve things.<br>  <br>  Do you realize the function served by prices?  When set among willing participants, they guide the allocation of scarce resources.  Are you prepared to balance the needs of millions of uses?  The fixing of health costs, for political reasons, will surely try to act as if scarcity does not exist.  Can you account for what will not be funded because of your plans?<br>  <br>  If people manage to introduce what you desire, you will excuse many of us who will withdraw from society.  I share your vision for affordable health care for all.  We can achieve it if we more consistently pursue voluntary means.|`|jWcVcXZQaa	You raise some excellent points.  Maybe we can get back to what we were doing in the 50's and 60's building community hospitals.  This resulted in a lot of extra capacity, but it was a strategic decision due to the cold war.  we wanted the capacity in case of emergency.  As big corporations closed these down to limit competition, prices rose accordingly.  Increase supply and we have less upward price pressure.|`|u9g2Cl6Eaa	Remember, Obama is not pushing for a single payer tax system (read the last link for more).<br>  <br>  FACT - the USA spends more on healthcare PER PERSON than any other nation on the planet.  <br>  <br>  FACT - the US has higher death rates for kids aged under five than western European countries with universal health coverage.<br>  <br>  That means that a dead American four year old would have had a better chance of life if they were born in Canada, France, Cuba, Germany, Japan etc, all of which have universal health coverage.|`|jAgH5ewfaa	Fvck you, you jack@ss.|`|xkcLOfTKaa	I think you are missing the point.<br>  We all DO have access to GREAT health care...<br>  But it is already so criminally expensive (mostly due to government involvement) that no one can afford without come sort of insurance.<br>  <br>  Coverage is simply NOT the issue this country.<br>  The government reports that only about 15% of the population does NOT have insurance of some kind... And the U.S. Census Bureau reports that of that 15%, about 1/3 are in situations where they could afford it (meaning they simply don't want it)<br>  <br>  So... What happens when you cover that 12%???
RMM7BtMlaa	As long as you have evidence that your injuries are a result of his assault some action should be taken. If you feel afraid that he may harm you, it's really best that you let the police know I'm sure they'll be sympathetic. The police will probably enquire into this if they deem the case as serious, has he assaulted you recently? If yes then the action taken may be more prompt. At most they action taken would  probably be to give him a restraining order and maybe even a jail sentence. It's probably best to ask a local police officer (maybe anonymously) and see if there is any advice he/she can give you. Hope this helps!!!!

I'm sure I didn't imagine all the accusations of treason against liberals over the last eight years for criticizing the president.<br>  <br>  However, unlike you I don't practice doublethink, and have always thought it legitimate to criticize the president concerning his policies.

16vMIGPiaa	Morality isn't the issue with a mortgage.  What's at stake is turning contract law on its head.<br>  It's approximately the same issue with manufacturer's contracts with labor.  However, while one's primary residence cannot be taken away by a bankruptcy judge, the same cannot be said for the benefits agreements made in union contract negotiations.|`|M7oAG5Aiaa	Once the laws are changed it will no longer be able to be viewed as such, but more to your point, it is absolutely a contradictory point of view.|`|MbssN5dcaa	Immoral.... NO.<br>  <br>  <br>  Unethical.... YES.<br>  <br>  **************************************...<br>  You are comparing apples and oranges.  Individual mortgages are individual responsibilities.  However, a corporate collective bargaining impacts MILLIONS of people.  Imagine what would happen if all the autoworkers walked out because they didn't get a warm and fuzzy.  That would be a tremendous loss to Detroit, Michigan, the United States of America, men, women, children, and their stockholders.  The Big-3 were forced into a suicidal contract.|`|JV75Iz3eaa	I'll let others decide the morality, suffice to say when a judge can lop off a boatload of principal and let the collateral stay in the hands of the deadbeat borrower you can kiss the mortgage lending industry goodbye, at least at interest rates that people are accustomed to.

0jLL9GIsaa	Rarely is any Gov spending "temporary"|`|AA10578359	I think the banks that have failed, or are failing need to be fixed.  I don't know about doubling the stimulus.  Don't truly know how spending more money on hidden agendas will help anyone.<br>  <br>  I also think that those bankers who are buying back failed mortgages as ridiculously low rates and making billions off their own failings should be imprisoned.<br>  <br>  I mean, if someone is caught doing major computer crimes, some of their punishment is to not have a computer, or access to the internet.  Why can't we do the same thing to bankers?  If they failed their bank and put it into limbo, then they should not be allowed to make money off the same kind of business.  <br>  <br>  We, the taxpayers, are footing the bill for these so-called bail-outs and stimulus plans.  So, taxpayers pay 13.00 less per week, or pay period, or whatever, but our taxes are being wasted on fluff that won't benefit anyone who pays taxes.  It only benefits those who can't pay their mortgage, or those who have sex for a living, or those who use drugs and don't work or pay taxes, or the poor folks who believe that the country owes them their living......  <br>  <br>  I, unfortunately, cannot agree with you unless you can bring me more logical thoughts as to why you believe doubling the stimulus would help.<br>  <br>  Addendum:<br>  <br>  Listening to the opinion of one published and one not published man does not give me the opinion that if there were more stimulus money that it would stimulate anything other than the democrats and their special pet projects that may or may not have anything whatsoever to do with improving the United States' economy.  <br>  <br>  They padded the stimulus, they padded the budget.  The only thing they did not pad was the banking bail-out which is being used frivolously by the banks themselves, so the Democrats don't have to worry about wasting THAT money.|`|BRyRtQSvaa	No one I hope!|`|AA10096992	"Nationalizing" is a propaganda word. Failing banks should go into receivership, which is a time-honored tradition for incompetent companies that run so poorly that the government seems brilliant by comparison.|`|isbGvDRZaa	Why temporarily?|`|c2f7b7e7c197d88a1a3ae7caa8ff6fc2aa	First of all, nothing the government does is temporary. If they take over the banks, it's forever.<br>  Second, that is completely unconstitutional. I swear I am the only person in the country that has read the thing. I know nobody in Washington D.C. has read it.<br>  Third, there is no money for the first "stimulous" package, it is 100% pure debt. Any further packages will also be 100% debt. We are already $14 TRILLION in debt, and you want to go farther in debt?!<br>  Fourth, the market has determined that these jobs must be lost. If you borrow money to "save" them, that means there is still no market for these jobs, they exist ONLY because you are artificially keeping them around based on debt. So when the money you borrowed runs out, the jobs still go away. You didn't save anything, you just put it off until tomorrow and incurred massive amounts of debt. You end up worse than you started.<br>  <br>  This is why people like you and Obama need be kept out of power. You don't have a clue as to what you are doing and will make the situation far far worse with your ignorant meddling. Too late now. When the economy collapses and we enter the new Great Depression, don't come crying to me. You are the effing morons that voted for the mentally challenged turd bucket.|`|72f2329713aaf1367f559e2d98aad351aa	All socialists in the world support these procedures|`|RyVeYdzNaa	At this rate Nationalizing the banks and tripling the stimulus bill would be better.  Even Republicans are on board for nationalizing the banks.  As far as the stimulus is concerned, Jobs are being lost at a far greater rate than the Obama administration anticipated.  We will need an all out FDR type of New Deal to get us out of this Depression.<br>  <br>  Nationalize the banks and then when the government restructures them they should be sold in pieces and not be allowed to be as large as they are.  If they are too big to fail then they are too big and dangerous to have in our economy.  If these banks are so large that they can bring down our entire economy on a global scale, then they should not be allowed to be this big ever again.

If you had been paying attention the stock market started to crumble soon after it became apparent that Obama was not only the candidate of the left, but that he hada a good shot at becoming our president.

As early as 2004 models and movie stars were asking to be paid in some other currency besides US dollars.<br>  In 2006 property values were falling and banks were starting to reduce lending.<br>  I think the only reason they say 2007, is because all people agree that it started well before 2008 or Inauguration day 2009, and you aren't going to get a right-winger to admit to it starting before 2007, so its a year everyone can somewhat agree on.<br>  <br>  the largest problem right now is reduction in consumption caused by falling consumer confidence. Consumer confidence is falling due to outsourcing. Companies started leaving American every since trade was deregulated in the 80s.<br>  That is when our recession started.

Bush tried to save the economy by doing tax cuts and that was successful. Democrats then tried to focus the public's attention on Iraq while they secretly sabotaged the economy. Then through pressure Bush finally caved in when he didn't want to because the democrats pushed for reform. I believe if the liberals had not done what they did in secret the United States would not have gone into a recession as we have now. Liberals needed the economy to fail so they could take credit for bringing the country back from the brink. That is why right now they say give the stimulus package time so that they can get their plan moving of getting socialism running. I guess they will never learn.

LJwhaNIDaa	Obama is a skilful liar and and an even more skillful blamer. <br>  <br>  Obama is still blaming Bush, even though Obama fully supported Tarp and has spent more in two months than Bush spent in eight years. <br>  <br>  Obama is in the game now.  Bush is no longer a player.  <br>  <br>  Continuing to blame Bush for the economy is like an Olympic athlete blaming his inability to win a sporting event on last year's players.  <br>  <br>  Obama was all flash and no substance.

x518rTyoaa	Rocket, you obviously know nothing about guns. You could buy guns 3 or 4 times stronger than AK-47s under that ban, but you couldn't buy a .22 if it looked like an AK. Believe me, I'd rather be shot by a tiny caliber gun that looked like an "assault weapon" than get shot by a .475 that looked like a hunting rifle. <br>  <br>  Jbird my man, Obama is crazy. Not only does he want that stupid ban (as if a pistol gripped shotgun kills people more effectively than a regular one), but he also wants to limit mag capacity to 5 rds. You know how many crimes are committed using more than 5 rounds? Like less than one percent. Not to mention, this is his sneaky way of completely eliminating revolvers, because I haven't seen many revolvers that hold less than 6 rounds....<br>  <br>  Rocket, you're still not getting it. The assault weapons ban only banned cosmetic features like pistol grips, collapsible stocks, etc. They did not ban anything that affected the way the gun actually works. That doesn't count banning full automatic weapons, which I'm fine with. Nobody needs full auto.
rmbUuqlRaa	There exists a widespread controversy over human embryonic stem cell research that emanates from the techniques used in the creation and usage of stem cells. Human embryonic stem cell research is controversial because, with the present state of technology, starting a stem cell line requires the destruction of a human embryo and/or therapeutic cloning. However, recently, it has been shown in principle that adult stem cell lines can be manipulated to generate embryonic-like stem cell lines using a single-cell biopsy similar to that used in preimplantation genetic diagnosis that may allow stem cell creation without embryonic destruction. It is not the entire field of stem cell research, but the specific field of human embryonic stem cell research that is at the centre of an ethical debate.<br>  <br>  Opponents of the research argue that embryonic stem cell technologies are a slippery slope to reproductive cloning and can fundamentally devalue human life. Those in the pro-life movement argue that a human embryo is a human life and is therefore entitled to protection.<br>  <br>  Contrarily, supporters of embryonic stem cell research argue that such research should be pursued because the resultant treatments could have significant medical potential. It is also noted that excess embryos created for in vitro fertilization could be donated with consent and used for the research.<br>  <br>  The ensuing debate has prompted authorities around the world to seek regulatory frameworks and highlighted the fact that stem cell research represents a social and ethical challenge.|`|CDe5bEA6aa	Because the republicans with there twisted take on religion feel body tissue is greater to throw away in the garbage can then use it to unlock medical secrets that could in turn save human lives. What people can get through there THICK heads is the the Research uses the imbecile cord for such Research after babied have been born otherwise the cord will go into the trash can!|`|dLLk3e2eaa	Stem cells aren't, embryonic stem cells are.  You have to kill an embryo to get embryonic stem cells.  Recent advances in the field are making this unnecessary.<br>  <br>  plus many of us have seen "Soylent Green" and can see where embryonic stem cell research is headed.|`|2Srjjs4Maa	In just a few years, there might be embryo facilites where liberals impregnate women just to rip out the tiny little babies to turn them into stem cells. Like a chicken farm but with women.<br>  <br>  Liberals are a cruel and viscous people.|`|AA12103453	Stem cell research ISN'T controversial. No one minds it at all. It is EMBRYONIC Stem Cell research that is the issue. One of the reasons is that you can use ADULT stem cells, and NO ONE/Nothing has to die. For Embryonic Stem Cell research the embryo has to be killed/aborted. Yes it happens anyway, but what's to stop if from being done just for that purpose and how do you prove it is/isn't, so you can't stop it. Also Embryonic Stem Cell research can't live up to the billing, it has FAR more problems then Adult Stem Cells. The embryonic version is more likely to lead to mutations and cancer(which is simple a mutation).|`|9927c2d3a3fc73898bab8be2e8cb755daa	An embryo  is what results from a male sperm and female egg coming together.  It is many cell divisions from that humble beginning.  Many people (and I am one) believe that this is a human baby in its early stages of development.  When they remove stem cells from the embryo they are killing this human life.<br>  Stem cell research that is done from adult stem cells is having remarkable results while research that has been done from embryos has failed miserably.<br>  This research should not be funded by federal dollars.|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	I believe the controversy is because a fertilized egg is a human being.  Our modern advances in genetics - the very science liberals say we should not ignore - teaches this.  All of us were once embryos, and using them to experiment on and destroy strikes many as horrific and reminiscent of Nazi Germany.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	An embryo is technically not a living thing, that's the debate...the conservatives say it is, liberals say it isn't.  I say if it can live on its own outside the body, then its alive...otherwise, its a parasite.|`|BgZCETPZaa	Because its killing babies.

AA11598520	Perhaps the reason there is no science that supports the use of embryonic stem cells over adult stem cells is because they haven't been able to use science for the past 8 years either to prove or disprove that they work. <br>  <br>  For the record, I did not vote for Obama and think he's doing an horrendous job so far. I'm also a Bush supporter and I am proud that I voted for him twice. I wish he were there now. I also listen to Rush, just to make it clear.<br>  <br>  That said, no one is forcing women to have abortions to use the fetus. These fetuses are left over from in vitro attempts and will simply be thrown away. Frankly, I would prefer that their lives will have some sort of meaning rather than just tossed in the garbage. What better way to die than to make someone else's life better or even allow them to live? <br>  <br>  "Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends." Didn't Jesus say that?|`|t7KHxE2Iaa	Actually, embryonic stem calls have a higher capacity to grow into the needed cells, which a distinct benefit.<br>  <br>  This isn't a back door to abortion. Pro-choice advocates don't need a back door. We won this battle through the front door, decades ago. Obama is giving scientific research it's rightful place in our society. It's a new era now, George "God Speaks Through Me" Bush is out, reason and science are in.

tP8W6Q1Qaa	Obama is an anit-business president. He ran his entire campaign against those that had the money to invest into the market...

Look at what he has done to Switzerland... they are done! He personally killed that entire country. <br>  <br>  He is Nationalizing our banks here in the States, which drops their value. Raising taxes, which means less for people to spend, His health care is a mess, so nobody will touch those companies with a 10 foot pole, Wants to raise Capital Gains and Dividends Tax which really is a double dipping tax - complete bs. <br>  <br>  But when you have a openly anti-business president what did you expect.|`|3OZoLNM2aa	wall street and main stree give obama a NO confidence.<br>  <br>  expect further declines for the rest of the month.<br>  <br>  Maybe down to as low as 5500|`|AA10096992	All the same reasons why it went down before his inauguration.|`|AA11703704	Probably for the same reason its been dropping since last February|`|Z2t1ztS6aa	Because Capitalists and capitalist institutions don't work well under socialist regimes.

Failure to follow orders results in removal from office by impeachment, resignation in disgrace, or any other method they choose.<br>  <br>  So far, Obama is following orders - bankrupting the nation, implement neo-communist rules and regulations hidden in his economic relief packages, and setting the US up for de-sovereignization.|`|G4Y96LGqaa	Its only been two months, and his former senate seat has been up for sale, of course he knew nothing of it, so he claims! <br>  <br>  He has out spent Bush 3 to 1, and Bush was in for 8 yrs and two wars, and 9/11. <br>  <br>  He closed down Gitmo and stopped military tribunals, which I certain the terrorist love. <br>  <br>  Now Obama funds abortions in  foreign countries with tax payer dollars. <br>  <br>  Maybe we can impeach him and the lib-tards for intentionally bankrupting America.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	No, none at all unless he actually does something illegal.<br>  And he won't.

klj3cOFPaa	No, because generally in the U.S., income of citizens is taxable regardless of where it is earned, worldwide.  Whereas in Ireland, the law is different:  Irish citizens are only taxed on their income earned in Ireland.  <br>  <br>  The U.S. system is called a "residency-based" system, while the Irish system is called a "source-based" system.<br>  <br>  When U.S. citizens have offshore accounts, the only way to escape taxation is to hide the account.  That's what people were doing with their UBS accounts, as widely reported recently.  But assuming the IRS finds out about an offshore account of a US citizen, income received by the account is still taxable in the US.<br>  <br>  The people who think that it's easy for U.S. citizens to escape U.S. taxation by putting their money in foreign bank accounts don't really understand how international taxation works in general.  If it were that easy for rich people to not pay any U.S. tax, every U.S. rich person would already have all his or her money in a Cayman Islands account.|`|WCkOUF9aaa	Of course they are. They are all behind Obama & making sure their money is safe from taxes.|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	U2 are Irish and I have no idea what they do with their money.  There are plenty of places to hide assets and its not just entertainers who do so.|`|qq5nceCXaa	Of course they are, and it's probably legal.  It will be shell companies in the caymans or similar holding "assets" and the artists will be paying these companies to use these assets, say their songs.  The companies can then distribute the income to other companies that the artists who control them can then use, be that private jets, houses, cars or whatever.<br>  <br>  Still you don't have to offshore your assets to avoid tax when you have smart accountants<br>  <br>  "The IRS released data this month showing that the effective income tax rate on the 400 highest-income individual returns fell to just over 17% in 2006, down from 22% before President George W. Bush took office."|`|k6hicodfaa	Interesting as the only people you can call out are not actually American citizens.|`|MbssN5dcaa	It isn't just entertainers.

They make a mockery of the Average American in doing this as at least half of them are tax cheats, at least half don't even live in this Country, they make a choice to live elsewhere, and I am certain that many are part of the 47,000 secret Swiss accounts that are hidden tax cheats from the USA.

Check with the school that she attended last, as well.  They should have a copy of her birth certificate on file, as this is a requirement in most, if not all states.  As it is probably only a copy, it wouldn't do to take it to the DPS, but it should have all of the necessary information that this article recommends, such as parents' names, place of birth, etc.  A new social security card is easy to acquire, just fill out the form at the social security office in your city to apply for a new one.  She will need to know her number, so if she does not have it memorized, the school should have that on file, as well.  I would recommend that she apply to have the number changed, because if her mom would up and leave, taking all of the ID with her, she may very well try to steal your girlfriend's identity at some point.  Changing the SS number will make this much more difficult for her to do.

n2oEhdZiaa	The Guard is part time... minimum service commitment of one weekend a month and two weeks a year.  Basic and AIT (MOS) training are exactly the same as the regular Army and Army Reserve.  You will have more control over what MOS you choose in the Guard because in the Guard you pick and job and you join a unit.  You can do any MOS you qualify for that your state has as long as you are willing to drive to that unit.  Your recruiter will know what different types of units and manning needs are located at the armories nearest to your residence and then together you will try to match that up with a job you are specifically interested in.  <br>  <br>  In the meantime, your current job is federally protected while you do your Army training with the Guard and then you can come home.  If you prefer the military, your unit can release you to the active army after six months and you will already have the MOS you wanted locked in through your training with the Guard.  You will simply be ordered to a base and then be integrated with an active army unit.<br>  <br>  As far as dependency goes, you are technically still married so have two kids won't be an issue.  After you're divorced, depending on custody arrangements, you'll probably need a family care plan.  I would recommend staying married until you are done with Basic and AIT at least, if you can't make the marriage work.

But it’s the size of the planes, the frequency of requests and last-minute cancellations, and the political nature of many of her trips that scream out for accountability.<br>  <br>  Reading through the e-mail exchanges between DoD officials and Pelosi’s staff, you can’t help but feel very, very sorry for the men and women in uniform who have to put up with this woman — and even sorrier for all of us taxpayers who are footing her carbon footprint-expanding bills.

The constitution doesn't say anything about abortion. All issues not clearly stated in the constitution is left for the states to decide. Lifting the ban so federal money can go into these programs is unconstitutional.<br>  <br>  2. The constitution gives no new powers of taxation. While the 16th amendment does the government the power to tax, part of the funding is coming from sources that were never meant to be taxed in the first place.<br>  <br>  3. Some of this money is going to abortion clinics and other scientific research places outside of the country. Again in the constitution it doesn't talk about contributions to other countries.

g5FbtzNTaa	There are many reasons. For one, he's afraid to step out of his comfort zone. Not unheard of among liberals. Second, it's above his pay grade. Obomber can't afford to look and sound like a bigger fool than he already has. Third, it would be boy against men. Obomber is willing to appear on the view with a bunch of cackling hens but isn't comfortable among real men of stature and substance. There are many economists, and others who understand the economy who have offered suggestions but it goes against his socialist agenda; ergo he's not willing to offer his ear to them. He has no intention of turning around the economy if it risks losing his socialist dream. He has no intention of standing up to savage terrorists unless it means selling out this country entirely.<br>  <br>  Edit: If you wanted a fair and balanced debate, you would have to pair Obomber to Jonathan Krohn.

yHWBrBA4aa	Bolt action > Semi-auto anyday.  <br>  <br>  But if you insist on sticking with the semi-auto; you can't go wrong with a .17 Mach 2, .22 Hornet or .22 WMR.  <br>  <br>  Don't knock these calibres!  They each have very low noise, little recoil, supreme accuracy for short-medium engagements, ammo is lightweight and plentiful.  So some research on these calibres; hell you can even get away with a .22 LR to kill someone.  <br>  <br>  As for companies.  The 10/22 Ruger is indestructible, reliable and accurate.  Marlin 60, Savage MKII series, CZ-USA series.  All are reliable, cheap and affective.<br>  <br>  Optics choice.  You will want a variable powered, parralax wide objective optic.  Look in the range of 3-12x for magnification and an objective diameter of 40mm or 50mm.  Bushnell, Tasco, BSA, Leapers all make good quality and affordable optics.  I do suggest you invest in high profile scope mounts so you can retain the use of your iron sights.  When things get close and personal, magnification is your enemy.  The ability to be able to switch over to your iron sights to make accurate shots out to 100 ft is a great feature.|`|AOFOT1CUaa	You should read The Zombie Survival Guide by Max Brooks.

AA11598520	Yep, links to the mofia or, at least, his father did. His father, a swell guy, called on the mafia to guarantee JFK's election in Chicago. They actually found some of the ballot boxes floating in Lake Michigan. (Incidentally, Nixon's people told him he should insist on a recount but Nixon, knowing the election had been stolen from him, refused saying it would be bad for the country. You don't hear that too often, do you?) <br>  <br>  So, JFK is elected and Bobby, another swell guy, is appointed Attorney General, and Booby actually goes after the mob! The mob only does something because they are getting something in return and, no doubt, they thought they had a President in the White House. Now, after getting him elected, he goes after them, publicly and on TV as well? The mob wasn't going to be double crossed. And they needed to prove just how much power they really had. What better way to do that then to put a hit on the President of the United States and actually accomplish it? <br>  <br>  I think that Oswald was just a nut that was used as a pawn to cover up the mob's involvement. That's why, I believe, Ruby, a low level mob member who owed them money, killed Oswald--so he wouldn't talk about who he knew or who put him up to it. And, then, mysteriously, Ruby dies of a heart attack in prison? How convenient. <br>  <br>  JFK was no angel and only became one because he was the first sitting President murdered since Lincoln. He was the best out of the three brothers, but that isn't saying much.<br>  <br>  And how does that first guy say that JFK didn't want the war in Vietnam? He was the one who sent advisers over there in the first place. Please!|`|ck1wvh91aa	I think he was killed because he was attempting to take the country in a new direction in the Cold War and talking with Castro and Kruschev about ramping down tensions. Read his speech at American University. Elements of the mob were likely involved in his assassination, but it was much bigger than that. The mob had a history of cooperation with the CIA and the anti-Castro Cuban community, and it appears likely that a combination of these elements was responsible for JFK's assassination. I highly recommend "Brothers: The Hidden History of the Kennedy Years," by David Talbot. It reads like a novel and provides good context through which to examine the death of JFK.

A single person is more than capable of assassinating a world leader.  It has happened in the U.S. and elsewhere numerous times.

AA10164318	The nation had been battling the slavery issue for at least 10 years before the south left the Union.<br>  <br>  The south enjoyed political prominence, in part, due to the fractional slave population count that allowed representation.  They were actively pushing to expand slavery into the northern states and new states.<br>  <br>  The north was populated by independent farmers and factory laborers.  They perceived a plot by the south to import slavery to the north and take employment away by out-competing paid workers.  <br>  <br>  The battle of importing slaves into the north was being fought at the "why can't I bring my personal slave with me when I travel?" level, and the fugitive slave act was pushed through by the south.<br>  <br>  When Lincoln was elected, the south saw no hope of adding to the number of slave states, and they seceded, hoping to attract new slave states to the confederacy.<br>  <br>  So the war was about stopping the ADVANCE of slavery, more than freeing the slaves in the south.  The abolitionist movement was not that large.  And many in the north fought simply to defend their country.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	It had a lot to do with economics.  The southern plantations were heavily dependent on the cheap labor that slaves represented.  The industrialized north was not.  So it was a simple matter to emancipate the slaves in the north, but not so for the south.<br>  <br>  The southern states saw themselves as being poorly represented in Washington.  Lincolns election was the straw that broke the camels back.  The southern states saw they would not be "properly" represented and knew that without such representation, they would not be able to prevent the emancipation of their slaves.  So they broke away from the union.<br>  <br>  When the south broke from the north, it became a constitutional matter. Once a state joins the union, they may never leave it.  So you have two issues going on there that revolved around slavery.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	After the war, during Reconstruction, African Americans voted in all parts of the country, elected representatives to Congress in the South because those states had large African American populations due to the large numbers of newly freed slaves.  After Reconstruction, nearly all civil rights were removed for African Americans under state laws in the South and job discrimination, which had been in effect throughout the country, continued.  It took nearly 100 years more for those issues to be addressed in the civil rights era. <br>  <br>  The North fought to preserve the union but the underlying root cause of the Civil War was slavery. The dramatic divisions between North and South centered around that issue.  <br>  <br>  Between the time that Lincoln was elected and the time that he was inaugurated, seven southern states had seceded from the Union.  Lincoln was the first president from the relatively new (1854) Republican Party, which had been founded as an anti-slavery party and was considered by the mostly conservative Southerners to be a radical party.  <br>  <br>  Some Republicans were only interested in keeping slavery out of the territories while others were for the immediate abolition of slavery and still others supported the granting of equal rights for African Americans. <br>  <br>  For a decade before the Civil War, the issue of slavery had been debated in Congress, especially each time a new state was to be admitted to the union.  This is a very complex issue but you might start by reading some of the debates in Congress.  <br>  <br>  You might also read the Declarations of Causes of Secession issued by the southern states that initially seceded from the union.  Their reasoning will help you understand the importance of the slavery issue in precipitating the Civil War.|`|4qnXCxlHaa	Lincoln didn't want to deal with the issue of slavery.  The primary reason for making the move was because he wanted to keep Europe from joining the Confederate side, and that was the way to do it, and he succeeded.<br>  <br>  It was the right thing to do, but there are questions about why he took that action.<br>  <br>  It took a long time to change the mindset of some people after the War, and with some people it's still difficult.|`|WhUV9k6Jaa	The war had little to do with slavery.  It was an economic war.  If the agrarian South had seceded the industrialized North would have had to pay more for raw materials and had increased competition from European nations whom the South would export to.  Like every war, it was about the $.|`|VkzmH1GKaa	The war was all about the money, why else were England and France so eager to help the South. The other issues were primarily brought in by politicians trying to gain public support for the war. Like it or not that's just the way it was.|`|QCTMW0NRaa	the original reason for animosity between the north and the south was money. the south had large plantations and a long growing season, therefore slaves were profitable. <br>  <br>  In the north, especially New England, slaves were not worth the money because many cash crops like indigo and cotton did not grow in the north, plus it had a short growing season. This was the original reason the north was against the south having slaves, in short, the north was not making as much money as the south.<br>  <br>  However, this caused slavery to be publicly ridiculed by the north and then the public was exposed to the horrible living conditions and treatment of the slaves. <br>  <br>  Once people realized this, slavery started to become opposed because of moral reasons. New Hampshire was the first state to make slave ownership illegal based on moral values.|`|AA10958272	Your answer is complex -- but I can give it a try... <br>  <br>  The North didn't fight against the South.  The South following suit of South Carolina tried to LEAVE the USA.  The idea of a "state's" rights were on the line vs. Federal edicts. Meaning the Congress & President could or couldn't enforce/enact laws onto the States -- which were all-powerful. The USA was rapidly expanding West, etc. and each new state would have to be dealt with -- over the issue of Slavery and whether human beings would be allowed to be bought & sold, etc. That was a 20-yr history at LEAST leading into the Civil War. Older states, like South Carolina for example... simply did not WANT TO LISTEN to Washington D.C. and Abe Lincoln nor any Republican that spoke about abolishing slavery (and routinely wrote & talked with a Frederick Douglass, etc.). <br>  <br>  Slavery was ABSOLUTELY hand in hand with WHY the Civil War happened -- only, many people don't want to see that, or understand that.. as it was disguised as "states rights". But, THE ISSUE at hand in the State's Rights was, in fact, bondage/slavery and what SHOULD happen as the USA expands west. Lincoln NEW that a "divided" country, along a dopey/imagined line of North and South wouldn't work -- "a house divided.. would soon fall"... and that GB and France were licking their chops over eventual pieces of a fractured USA. <br>  <br>  After the war.. in fact President U.S. Grant and Congress sought & enacted fantastic freedoms across the South for nearly 20 years -- which saw black elected offices, business, seeds of real achievement across the South. But, the Southern Democrats (or Dixiecrats) had other ideas.. and because of bartering/dealing over issue after issue, advances were retracted in the South @1780 that led to the ensuing (and worsening) life conditions for blacks, that they left for the northern industrial cities (Chicago, NY, Philly, St. Louis) where they were better received.  Life was brutal to unfair for 100 years. The Dixiecrats maintained their status quo for all that time -- until it was broken by a Southern Democrat in Lyndon Baines Johnson with a SERIOUS approach to ending what he saw all his life, in Texas, etc. etc. and it was LBJ that enacted CIVIL RIGHTS legislation. (Although at DNC Conventions, they still pretend that JFK had something to do with anything.. because the Southern Dems STILL HATE LBJ to this very day!!).  Even Obama for example, toe'd a line not to mention LBJ and risk reaction across the South.. from the Dixiecrats. <br>  <br>  Bigotry is going to exist, as it's human. It's a defense mechanism. But, until America can say that the president is Obama, period. And that he's horrible because of (add your reason) and criticize him just as fluidly as say, a Jimmy Carter or GWB... then, there's no real equality is there? Pro or con, we're still reacting based on FACE. And that's pathetic, in 2009. "Content of character" and "actions" etc. should rule, now.|`|AA11506593	The American Civil War wasn't really about slavery. Many slaves in the South were already freed or would have been freed when the next generations became owners of the land/plantations. <br>  <br>  The Civil War was really about one group of people trying to tell another equal group how to live their lives. It didn't set well with the Southerns. In addition, there were issues concerning free trade, European interests, and of course, money!|`|AA10248239	Although the majority of Americans were opposed to slavery, there still was widespread racial discrimination after the Civil War.

The Northern states saw this as a threat to their economy.|`|uGkLRQsxaa	because the civil war wasnt about race or slavery|`|vwtANn8aaa	the civil war was fought over the issue of states' rights. northern states favored a strong, supreme central government. the southern states favored stronger state governments that were confederated for the purpose of national defense and interstate commerce as was laid out in the constitution. <br>  <br>  slavery was one issue where the issue of states rights was extremely prevalent. the southern states wanted to keep the doctrine that allowed states to choose whether or not they wanted to be free. the northern states wanted the issue to be resolved nationally.<br>  <br>  the election of lincoln told the southern states they would be losing more sovereignty, so they left the union. this made the north mad because they wanted to preserve the union, and also had bad land for farming and needed the raw goods from the south to support thier indutrial economy. having to import raw goods from a separate nation would be hard on the economy, so they went to war.<br>  <br>  ending slavery wasn't a political goal in the war until lincoln issued his emancipation proclamation, which ironically, didn't free any slaves in the north, but said that any southern slaves would be free if the state didn't quit the war. this served to discourage border slave states like kentucky from secedeing. but since he had no power in the south, it didn't free anyone.<br>  <br>  most northerners, even though they opposed slavery didn't see blacks as "equals" and so it took a while to reverse this way of thinking and give blacks equal rights.|`|Rkrx6GW7aa	Well Lincoln didn't just declared war on the Confederacy just for Slavery.

But, only a fool can ignore that he walked into a BAD situation.  I'm not sure that the market wouldn't be just as bad under McCain, after all he was certainly on board with TARP.  McCain likes to call himself a conservative, but he's far from it.  The biggest difference, is that Obama's policies are delaying a turn around, and discouraging growth.  <br>  <br>  To answer your question, I do think the first six weeks are an accurate forecast.

Obviously the stock market isn't going to remain monotonic during his four years.<br>  <br>  And again, first off the stock market was already headed in the same direction with a similar velocity for months before Obama was inaugurated.

Therefore, in a year, the temperature will reach more than 1500 degrees!<br>  <br>  That's the same reasoning you are using.<br>  <br>  Historically, the stock market performs better over the long term during Democratic administrations as compared to Republican administrations.|`|AbRfd29Haa	Of course not. <br>  <br>  For one, the stock market was headed down, down, down long before Obama took office. It's the result of the horrible economic crisis created by 8 years of the Bush Administation, by Democrats not opposing those policies, and by various bits of de-regulation leading back to the Clinton Era. <br>  <br>  Some of it's certainly due to Wall Street's reaction to Obama's work, but that's only their reaction... Obama hasn't been in office 50 days. Nothing he's actually done is even starting to have a real effect in the world yet. Some of the fears on Wall Street are just due to uncertainty, and some is due to the fact that much of the Wall Street nonsense that was formerly tolerated, and led directly to this crisis, is not going to be tolerated anymore. <br>  <br>  You need to not worry so much about the stock market.. much of what happens there in short term is fiction. And in fact, much of the stock prices in the last 4-8 years have been very fictional.. that's not a partisan claim, but simply based on real numbers. Historically, a company's value reflects their actual profits. In recent times, market valuations have been dramatically higher than normal based on income. That's the obvious sign of a bubble, and that bubble has now burst, pushed on by the financial and housing collapses (again, things realized long before Obama took office), but inevitable at some point anyway. <br>  <br>  Stock prices effect most people little on their own.. even if you have a retirement portfolio, things are pretty likely to bounce back.. to an extent. If you bought big during a bubble, maybe not for some years or even decades. But bad times don't last forever. And the stock prices are far less reflective of the real state of business than on lots of investors, rich people and fund managers, betting on the future. They've been wrong before... many of them are responsible for this crisis, in fact. No mature companies make money based on their stock prices.. it's just one investor to another. So it's an indicator, sure, but don't over estimate its importance. The rate of unemployment and the rate of mortgage foreclosure will mean far more about the real state of the economy. Wall Street isn't our economy, it's a reaction. <br>  <br>  Even Nobel Prize winning economists don't know if Obama's plans are enough to stave off a dramatically deeper Recession or even a Recession. But the vast, vast majority of Economicts wanted action of some kind. A smaller majority believes the current efforts are not enough, but they did have to bow to political realities. Everyone who's studied history knows that, without a doubt, Hoover's "do nothing" approach is what ultimately pushed the late 20's Recession it the early 30's Depression, and it was Roosevelt's New Deal that pulled us out... slowly, but it did. Things are remotely as bad... yet. Unemployment was at 25% in the latter days of the Hoover administration, it's only about 8.2% now.. not even the second worst than the depression (that would be the Reagan recession of '81-'82, in which unemployment was at 10%). <br>  <br>  But here's the thing.. private spending has dropped by nearly $4 trillion since this thing started. "Private spending" is the thing that pays for jobs... I get paid, I spend so you can get paid, you spend so the next guy can get paid, and so on. When that stops.. bad news. If I get fired, I'm not spending anymore. Enough like me and you don't paid anymore, and so on. The current "Stimulus" bill isn't remotely enough to replace that $4 billion (it was more like $3.5 billion when they first started talking about this bill... and the effects are just now, in the last week, hitting the street, still in a small way). <br>  <br>  You don't have to like it, you can give me a thumbs down or whatever, but you ought to make real world decisions based on the actual facts.. which I'm presenting.|`|ebd0189efd63c93e058ddd9c6850db5faa	Tom Goad said "Sometimes I weep for the poor level education level of conservatives"  That is classic!  <br>  <br>  Confused said historically the market preforms better under Democrats than Republicans.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stockcharts.com/charts/historical/djia1900.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stockcharts.com/charts/histor...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.stockcharts.com/charts/historical/spx1960.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.stockcharts.com/charts/histor...</a><br>  <br>  I'd love to see them explain the charts above to me.

Some of them were old and some were young. Most of them were facing hard times while very few were content and happy. This was all because the leader of their country President Tree really had been messing up and ruining their land. <br>  <br>  The People of this land, which was called North of Mexico, held an election to replace President Tree. The election was held and many people came out to vote. They elected President Barboma. He promised he would make the country better and equal for all. After he has been president for 60 days, many people in the country started to wonder if he would be really be a better President.<br>  <br>  They did not remember that it took President Tree 8 long years to ruin the country and that President Barboma would need more time than 60 days because he did not have a magic wand that could fix everything right away. <br>  <br>  Over the next few years President Barboma worked hard and followed through on all of his promises to the country. Everyone in the country was happy, they had new jobs and homes and they were really happy. They were all realizing they made a good choice when they chose the new President, because they all went to sleep with full belly, under a strong roof and worked everyday at their wonderful jobs. Everyone in the land of North of Mexico lived happily ever after.<br>  <br>  You all need to wake up and realize Rome was not built in a day....our economy was not ruined in a day.... and it will not be fixed in a day. Talk to your relatives who lived through the great depression.. ask them how they survived it.. the answer will be : families join together pooling resources.. neighbors helped out neighbors.. and the community helped each other. My grandmother tells stories about waiting in line for monthly rations of butter flour sugar and even pantyhose... smaller families share extra supplies with larger families and maybe larger families had bigger gardens and share fresh vegetables with neighbors..if your neighbor was a mechanic or plumber they helped another neighbor fix something just to help... The problem we have now in america is everyone is ME ME ME....many people live on a road and do not even know the neighbors on there road...people lived the keep up with the Jones life style buying houses they could not afford one just one of the salaries of a couple.... yelled charge it as they went out to dinner or to the mall.. instead of spending within their means and unfortunatelty we are all paying for it now even the ones who did not manage their money poorly. <br>  <br>  So obama has a lot of work to do, Bush left this coutnry screwed to the wall... and Obama needs time and support to fix it... He is one man... a man without a magic wand or magical powers... but he is a man with a brain who needs time to oraginze and put his plan in action and congress needs to back him.|`|NnY1wG11aa	Well we all know who you are referring to, well most of us do, its good old  "Gordy", but hang on a minute, Global Crisis that requires a Global Solution, we must work with America to make sure that this recession is dealt with appropriately.<br>  <br>  Now I always thought that the world was more than just America and Britain, what about the rest of Europe and Asia or is it that Gordy only see's and hears what he wants to, as many in Europe think his idea to save the world is FLAWED and doomed to fail, and his handling of the British economy over the past 10 or so years was also doomed to failure.|`|RYQ3i0ZNaa	I agree with the whole "global crisis requiring a global solution" bit, but why are we only working with America? Surely we should be working with the (rather more important) Asian countries, like China, Japan, India etc. as well?<br>  <br>  But the families bit is Brown spinning the old labour "we help poor people and families" lie again.|`|T1ffrjHAaa	......another Labour spin.......<br>  <br>  Make it look like you are doing something about something you should have done something about a long time ago.....
THYJUsavaa	It's all about the spin.  If you're for stem cell research and the govt. stops funding it with TAX-PAYER dollars, then you spin it so that people will believe that stem cell research has been banned.  It's simply a form of manipulation to push an agenda...it obviously has worked.<br>  <br>  Blessings|`|1tNmUmE3aa	I've been told that adult stem cells will do the same thing, they don't have to use embryos!

I don't want MY TAX DOLLARS going to foreign abortions OR stem cell research. Isn't this country broke as it is?|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	Mostly because of misinformation. I have believed for years that Bush had banned stem cell research as well as cloning. Although I couldn't understand how cloning was being done despite that misinformation, I had no idea that stem cell research was also being done. I am only finding out today that it was the funding that was unfairly halted.|`|Z2t1ztS6aa	You're completely right! A government shouldn't be funding anything controversial like that. It's like tax-payer funded abortion, even if you're pro-choice (pro-killing) then you shouldn't force other people to pay for the deaths of babies that aren't pro-mass murder. People should never have to pay for welfare or funding of sciences they don't support. IT's stupid and immoral and wrong.|`|6wyWTsfGaa	true very true. i personally don't want the government aiding something that controversial. the government should only sponsor laws when it comes to those issues not funds|`|0jLL9GIsaa	It fits their agenda to leave that little fact out.|`|yk9xwLwNaa	You are trying to tell the truth to propagandists so brainwashed that they will never understand it.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	Because we have to come to expect the gov't will pay for everything in our lives.  I believe it is sorely needed but I also believe that adult stem cells can be used too.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	He restricted the stem cells used to a group that was already in existence, no new ones could be used, as cells reproduce they become less healthy, new strains were needed but couldn't be created.<br>  The rest of the world governments were happy to step in and help the scientists, they know that patents will be developed and they will see the benefits if their experiments bear fruit.<br>  While there is no guarantee on any experiment the fact is that we are now eight years behind the rest of the world, and that's going to be difficult to make up.<br>  Our best scientists in the field went overseas, so while he may not have stopped it from private research, private resources weren't going to invest in a procedure when it carried so much stigma that they could count on protests and no government support.<br>  <br>  The reason we have scientific research is because we don't yet know what will or won't work,  embyronic cells, or adult cells, but cutting off half the field isn't conductive to reasearch.<br>  And those embryonic cells are in test tubes and would be discarded unless used in this manner.  In no way, except in the realm of science fiction would a baby appear in a test tube.  The whole point is to get to the cells while they can still form all varieties of cells.|`|9dEotvVwaa	Because the answer to a liberal agenda item that doesn't get funding is to blow it up in the Media, make it sound like the Republicans are blocking the issue, and keep pounding on it until a Democrat gets in office.<br>  <br>  I am against government subsidies for any kind of private ventures.  If a private company can't support their industry on the merits it SHOULD fail.|`|7OQWOaGmaa	Government (the American taxpayer) shouldn't fund stem cell research nor abortion.

Billeting on Army posts can also be used. The catch with using billeting is since you are not PCS'ing to that base (whether it is Air Force or Army) you will most likely be classes as Space A.

BrjZhySIaa	To answer the short of it: "does conservatism work?" ....<br>  <br>  It was conservatism, or liberalism, that started when Alexander Hamilton pegged the Dollar to a gold standard.  Over the years, the dollar was traded with good faith as the economy rolled along.  It was through the Great Depression that Europe went off the gold standard which enabled the dollar to become the world's leading currency.  I tell you this because sound money is more relevant than the policies themselves.  <br>  <br>  Conservatism is what made America the most prosperous nation on earth in under 200 years.  Back then we actually adhered to the Constitution.  THAT's where the problem en lies; we have strayed FAR away from Constitutional values....and the gold standard.<br>  <br>  But don't fool yourself, modern day "conservatives" like Bush and Cheney, are actually Neoconservatives and they essentially are cut from the Socialist-liberal cloth.<br>  <br>  So in short, yes, traditional conservatism works.  We as a society are overly generous in general.  How many other nations have Goodwill, The Salvation Army, United Way, etc???<br>  <br>  The underlying issue is not just the spending by the government, but the rate at which the money supply has increased matched with the fact that Nixon completely destroyed Bretton Woods and the only ties left the dollar had to a gold standard.|`|4SLjJvcqaa	Why do liberals get the blame for poor people buying houses?<br>  <br>  After Bush and McCain "warned" that Freddie and Fannie were unstable<br>  <br>  THEY THEN SADDLED BOTH WITH THIS !!!<br>  Bush pushed this until it passed<br>  <br>  Wasn't Bush brilliant in creating government financing plans so people did not need downpayments on their home?<br>  in the middle of a housing bubble?<br>  <br>  More Americans than ever own their own homes, but we must continue to work hard so that every family has an opportunity to realize the American Dream. In 2002, I announced a goal to add 5.5 million new minority homeowners by the end of the decade. Since then, we have added 2.3 million new minority households. My Administration has also set a goal of adding 7 million new affordable homes to the market within the next 10 years. In my FY 2006 budget, I proposed a single family housing tax credit and two mortgage programs -- the Zero Downpayment mortgage and the Payment Incentives program -- to help more families achieve homeownership. In 2003, I signed the American Dream Downpayment Act, and I have proposed more than $200 million to continue the American Dream Downpayment Initiative to provide downpayment assistance to thousands of American families. By promoting initiatives such as financial literacy, tax incentives for building affordable homes, voucher programs, and Individual Development Accounts, we are strengthening our communities and improving citizens' lives. <br>  <br>  NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE W. BUSH, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim June 2005 as National Homeownership Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities recognizing the importance of homeownership.|`|9851306172d176bf90c2970ca456d866aa	The principle that informs conservative economic thinking is that work, investment, innovation and risk-taking should be rewarded.<br>  <br>  Conservatives give a much larger share of their income to charities to help the less fortunate than liberals do.|`|0db7dfe907b8101041f1b50d64e06e6baa	The Conservative position is that it is not government's responsibility to entice people into buying homes, or to bail them out of bad investments.  The Conservative position is one that is based on the idea of personal resonsibility.  Without personal responsibility, there is not freedom.  When you were a child, you couldn't do certain things, like enter into a contract, because you were considered not legally responsible.<br>  <br>  If people want to enter into contracts, like purchasing a home with a mortgage, they need to review the terms, inspect the house, know the market & c.  If this is too much for them, they need to refrain from entering into this contract.<br>  <br>  People making foolish decisions is not the fault, nor the responsibility of the taxpayers.  Some people chose to do little or nothing with their lives.  This is their decision.  The small number of people who are actually unable to support themselves are the responsibility of us, as individuals, not government.  We each have a personal moral responsibility to take care of those in need.  When we allow government to create a system of "entitlements", we can expect a system of fraud and abuse.<br>  <br>  Politicians as a rule, are not really interested in helping we the taxpayers as much as they are interested in helping themsleves.  We can see this in the way they have provided for themselves.  The salaries and benefits, the exemptions they provide for themselves, and their apparent freedom from prosecution for crimes committed against the taxpayers.<br>  <br>  The Liberal view is that government is supposed to replace your mother and your father.  And don't confuse the Neocons with true Conservatives - there is no comparison.<br>  <br>  The Conservative position is based on freedom and responsibility.|`|888173de53a1103582161858fdde458caa	You are correct.  We feel the government should let us do what we want within the law and stay out of business.<br>  <br>  But you mentioned where the government went against what Conservatives believe and forced banks to invest in losers.<br>  <br>  Over time, this system collapsed upon itself.<br>  <br>  Conservative also believe in voluntary charity as opposed to "progressive taxes," or forced charity.<br>  <br>  We realize there will always be lowlifes and bums who think the government owns them something.  Does this mean we need to accept it and support these bums?<br>  <br>  And I don't agree the number of such lowlifes is sizable.  Socialist programs in America, like welfare, encourage the lack of trying.  If America were truly run with Conservative ideals, there would be far fewer low lifes, and we would all have a better standard of living.<br>  <br>  But socialists, with their misguided ideas of what poor people need, only make things worse.  Much like Obama is doing to the economy now.|`|qKr5wRxyaa	A real conservative that believes in the free market and succeeding/failing on your own merits would have let the banks fail under lots of bank's un-ethical and horrible business practices. <br>  <br>  Its basically their rationalization to stay in power and benefit the haves. Conservatives account for crimes against by the less fortunate by implementing hard laws. <br>  <br>  The conservative argument is inconsistent, I smiled at  your last paragraph because "committing crimes, forming unions, demanding weflare(COUGH BAILOUTS COUGH!!) taking bogus loans(COUGH MCDONALDS COUGH) all pretty much describe greater crimes by the haves. <br>  <br>  In other words they hold themselves to a double standard, robbing a gas station for $100 can get you 20 years in prison, embezzling millions through market fraud can get you less than 25% of that if you are a "have" with connections.

I'd like to address the last paragraph however. It's OK to have different results as long as opportunities are equal. If the have-nots want what the haves have, they will get educated, get good jobs or start businesses and save their money. America used to be all about such strivers who succeeded. Now we're all about bringing down the successful to the level of the unsuccessful.|`|vwtANn8aaa	you sound like karl marx, arguing that the gap breeds instability. and its true if there is no middle ground. however, in america we have a very large, and very stable middle class.<br>  <br>  this middle class keeps the people at either end of the spectrum from forcing the economy either way. the middle class deosn't demand welfare. the middle class doesn't take loans they can't afford (generall)<br>  <br>  in addition. unions, welfare, and forcing banks to give bad loans are all examples of governement involvement which aren't a part of conservative thought. in the free-market system, these banes wouldn't exist and couldn't hurt the upper classes.

iWLeHnlnaa	Well, in the U.S. they pay BILLIONS in taxes every year, and those same taxes help many things like Social Security, Medicare and even road maintenance. So if the Obama Administration grants Amnesty, we will just be ensured that the economy would have a better chance to recover faster, and not crumble like it would if all the illegals were deported.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.aollatinoblog.com/2008/04/14/do-immigrants-pay-their-fair-share-of-taxes-you-bet-they-do/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aollatinoblog.com/2008/04/14/...</a><br>  Do Immigrants Pay Their Fair Share of Taxes?

A stunning two-thirds of illegal immigrants pay Medicare, Social Security and personal income taxes. Yet, nativists like Congressman Tom Tancredo, R-Colo., have popularized the notion that illegal aliens are a colossal drain on the nation's hospitals, schools and welfare programs — consuming services that they don't pay for.|`|ipqxNSvCaa	Learn from the U.S.'s example.  We had a "one time" mass amnesty in 1986.  Supposedly for a million or so illegal aliens, but ended up amnestying 3 times that.  In fact, some cases from then are STILL being processed because of a recent court decision.  This "one off" was supposed to be accompanied by ENFORCEMENT.  It wasn't.  Once the amnesty was in place, vested interests lobbied to have enforcement ignored.  It was. We've also had several "mini amnesties" such as 245(i) and TPS for specific groups since 1986. We now have 12 million and more likely 20 million illegal aliens, most uneducated and unskilled, who are making massive use of social services and would make more use if they were legalized.  In the U.S., they'd be eligible for earned income tax credits, that is, would be net RECIPIENTS of tax money.  Not to mention, legalization would attract yet more illegal aliens AND legalized illegal aliens can sponsor their relatives so gain a lock on LEGAL immigration.|`|XTopfG8Taa	Not a chance, now is the time to get tougher.|`|J7pNK6fYaa	REPORT AND DEPORT<br>  <br>  WHAT PART OF ILLEGAL DO YOU PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTAND?!?!|`|oZqoxgc7aa	In the UK there are problems more serious than that as far as immigration goes.<br>  The fact that flying national flags is seen as an act of racial oppression in some places (Especially flying St. George's cross in England).<br>  Britain certainly needs to get much tougher as far as immigration.<br>  Amnesties are a ridiculous idea but they often weed out the harder to find illegals.

Either way, they would be living in a rented place!  The Military accommodations do have rules and regs, and when you leave, it has to be in the same state as it was when you moved in. Also, if your son is old enough, do they have educational facilities for the kids? If not, he would have to be transported to an outsdie school!  I am trying to cover all bases for you, OK! I would also check out how much the Military will pay you for living OFF base, and see which way would be the cheapest. Yes, there is a safety factor too.

You may not agree but there is logic behind them that most people find acceptable.|`|9BcQ5XMXaa	No, I understand both ...<br>  <br>  Giving tax break is the right thing to do. Right, our problem is that there is way too many houses on the market (foreclosures, people who sell their house, people who abandon them ,...) compared to the number of buyers ... therefore you and me get screwed because the value of our house decreased!! We need to keep people in their houses so houses in general stop decreasing in time.<br>  <br>  Apparently, there are ways for us to request a loan modification, based on the value of the house, not the initial loan. If you bought a house 5 years ago for $200,000 and it's worth today $100,000 ... you can check with your bank for them to find a middle ground. It's no refinancing. It's simply change the loan amount from 200,000 to let's say 150,000. Some banks start doing that.<br>  <br>  I feel you, I have two houses and I've been doing the right thing. But having people stay in their homes is the best thing for you and me, I promise|`|0f0dac4f4bfb6a4b2d01df90fd84b3ffaa	So wait, now Republicans are whining about tax breaks?

AA11494150	It is not illegal, as long as you don't use it to gain favors or to exercise any type of authority. <br>  <br>  However, it may be against your post's policy. You need to ask your Post Advisor. <br>  .|`|TtI7VtTfaa	No,<br>  <br>  you need to learn how to spell the word  "allowed" first.|`|tPvjd8qqaa	This could depend on how you came to have it in your possession.  If it has a department identifier on it, as in what city or agency, then it most likely was issued by that agency and is their property.  If it is lost or stolen, they will want it back.  If it isn't returned it will be considered stolen property and they will prosecute you for having it.<br>  Most States have a "lost property" statute which states that all "found" property must be turned over to the local police agency so an attempt can be made to find the rightful owner.  If the owner cannot be found, the finder can claim the property.  <br>  If you do have such a badge legally, the only way you can get in trouble is in how you use it.  If you wear it around and represent yourself as a police officer or their representative and you are not, expect trouble.  <br>  You may also receive trouble from people that do not like the police and may "take you on" just because you are associated with the police.  Or at least they think so if you are displaying such a badge.  That's why you don't see real police officers walking around off duty displaying their badges for everyone to see.  Take a look around, you will not be able to identify police officers driving their personal cars.  You can find firefighters because they all put that red sticker on their cars because everyone loves them.|`|a8e1KcS2aa	Most posts will issue everything that you need for your "hard uniform" and "soft uniform."  When I was an explorer, I proposed that we'd get fitted baseball caps for our soft uniforms, and that was approved, although we were never issued badges.  This is in part for the protection of the explorer.  Explorers have no legal powers, and as such are a civilian in every way.  Not only that, but you have to be under the age of 21 to be an explorer.  At that age, you're still growing and maturing.  I would suggest not having any type of badge or false identifications as all that a criminal would see is police affiliation - and that might be enough to get you wounded or killed.  I don't let explorers do ride-alongs with me unless if they're wearing a ballistic vest.  I bought an extra one for ride-alongs, and I give them the choice to wear it, but for any explorer, I make them wear it.  This is because most explorers in my post will actually leave the car with me on situations where I feel comfortable with them leaving the vehicle.  If a criminal were driving down the road, intent on hurting a police officer, and they saw a young man or woman wearing a uniform similar to an officers, in the presence of an officer, wearing a badge, that offender would attempt to harm that explorer.  That's why our post has a policy regarding badges.

Diversion is a unique experience allowing an individual to clear their record if and when all sanctions are being met through a set of rules called sanctions.

I have talked to a few and they are getting very upset at him swinging back to the left.<br>  <br>  Oh well 2010 will be fun, as will 2012, especially since he is alienating many who voted for him to push the liberal agenda.|`|nO1I48WIaa	No he is expecting the impossible and that is why I will not support him and the other idiots that he works with to get us out of this mess for after all they are the same ones that got us in it in the first place.

fyWbMXOHaa	Fist there is no Ft South Carolina, just say she's stationed in S.C. It's just like regular mail, put all the information in the order she had it on the envelope. I'm sure it would eventually get to her, might just take a bit longer. The length of time for mail is about the same as civilian mail depending on where you are stationed and what you are doing at the time.|`|htaxf1jJaa	The order makes everything take faster and more convenient. I have never written a letter to my brother or bf when they were in bootcamp and basic training a letter with the address not in order. It took my brother about 3 weeks after he shipped out for Marine boot camp for me to receive his first letter and he wrote me about 4 times but he wrote my parents all the time. Also I got my bf's first letter about a week and a half or two weeks after he shipped out for Air Force basic and after I got his first letter, I would get a letter every Thursday. They're only allowed to send mail on Sundays btw.|`|968837a2f6943f22a9655689e9626ee9aa	As long as the information is all there then I'm sure it will get there. It's best to put all the information in the same order to save confusion|`|BvZvZaxzaa	As long as you got her name and unit correct and sent it to the right installation, she will get the mail. If you didn't get the unit information right it will take longer to track her down. Assuming you DID get the name and unit info right it shouldn't take more than three days from NC to SC. Military mail handlers do a great job and you should expect letters to get back and forth as quickly as any other civilian mail. There were times when I was in Iraq that I got mail within 7 days of being sent but that is best case scenario not during any holidays. Overseas mail takes between 10-21 days depending on size, time of year, level of priority, etc...
tP8W6Q1Qaa	Ummm the Government Nationalized Citi and is now in control of the management.

Who knows what the price of gas will go to.  It will be Jimmy Carter all over again except this time it will be worse.  Many are predicting a second Great Depression.  I pray it won't get that bad but since Obama is making all the wrong choices and his stimulus is only going to make things worse, we certainly may be looking at a Depression.  <br>  <br>  Looking at the bright side, the MSM will not be able to cover for Obama forever.  Americans will see thru all their lies and vote him out as well as all the other Liberals in Congress and we could actually get the country back on track again if we can elect a Reagan style Conservative like Mike Huckabee or Howard Phillips in 4 years, and retake the Congress.<br>  <br>  After 4 years of Liberal Socialist Democrats in power there will no longer be any way to blame Conservative politcs.

htaxf1jJaa	The only time they're allowed to send out mail is on Sundays but they usually write mail on Saturdays and Sundays. My brother is in the Marines and when he was in boot camp last year I didn't get his first letter until about 3 weeks after he shipped out and he wrote me about 4 times but he wrote a lot to my parents. Also my bf just graduated Air Force basic training on Friday March 6 and he didn't write his first letter until about a  week and a half or 2 weeks after he shipped out and after his first letter I got one every week. Just wait because that's all you can do right now. The first few weeks are the toughest and most tiring for them. He will write you when he has the time. You can email me if you wanna talk cause I know what you're going through. I been there twice within the last year. <3|`|AA10604086	He can write all day Sunday.  There is no training on Sunday, except for essential details.<br>  Mail is picked up daily except Sunday, justlike anywhere else. if he is at Great Lakes, ( near Chicago.) then it should take no more than 3-4 days to have mail sent from there to the most rempotepart of the country.<br>  <br>  You know your boyfriend betterthan we do. Can he write a letter? or is he lost unless he can send emails or text.Some people are simply not comfortable with writing letters.<br>  <br>  .|`|9dd7255bfe9e90bbd64019154baae7a6aa	When I was in Basic (Army) We got 1 hour every night to get our gear cleaned and ready for the next day. If we had time we could write. On Sundays, we had to clean the Barracks, when done we had some time to do as we pleased (while inside the Barracks). So if we wanted to write, we wrote...<br>  <br>  Remember, he'll be working his *** off. He will be tired. He will be stressed at times. He will have other people to write...<br>  <br>  Just keep sending him letters. Even if you only get one a week, write him 7... Mail is the biggest moral booster in Basic.|`|AA10709853	if he wasn't a letter writer before, he won't suddenly turn into one now. Sundays are also spent doing other things like getting ready for inspections <br>  <br>  I got none the entire 9 weeks of Boot camp from DH.  Nor did my stepson write anyone, and HE went to Great Lakes with pre addressed and stamped envelopes!.|`|2AqU4SjYaa	Even back in the "dark ages" . . . in the MARINES . . . . <br>  <br>  we had about 30 minutes a night we could write, do what we wanted.<br>  <br>  Sundays, we had even MORE time . . . <br>  <br>  So . . . . if you are not getting letters . . . it is because he is not writing.<br>  <br>  Dan in Miami|`|4xOXiZcNaa	Just about the FIRST THING the DI will do is set his dumb assez down with paper and a pencil and tell him to WRITE A LETTER HOME... it's NOT A REQUEST.

I wasn't able to send my first letter until week 5.|`|0wiaAdJiaa	Sundays are normally a day of no training, so he should have some free time to write.  How long? Lol.  depends on where you live and your mail system.|`|GgG0inaUaa	He will have plenty of time to write. The real question is will he choose to use it.|`|mm5p5sy6aa	"only get an hour" How long does it take the kid to write?|`|MfZU1UpFaa	ha! boot camp? thats only called that in the MARINES... anything else is called basic training|`|rMDHNPnEaa	Maybe he's not into writing. Some people just aren't good at writing letters or don't like to.<br>  <br>  When I was in boot camp we had time to write. Granted we didn't have a lot of spare time, but we could write a letter if we wanted to. <br>  <br>  If he is in some kind of remedial training, say for instance he failed a test, then he may have even less time. If they are giving him extra instruction. <br>  <br>  It can take a week or two for military mail. It has to go through a few extra steps so he could have written you and his letter is in some bag somewhere waiting to go out.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much I am sure he is OK. It is not unusual  for people not to hear from their family/friends while in boot camp. It is a very stressful time and getting the time write might be a little pushed back. It is not that he don't care or nothing but maybe there are other things going on.<br>  <br>  Just try to be patient and keep you hope up. He will be OK and you will get to see him sooner than you realize it.|`|oiKvyjpUaa	In the military every body's experience is different. Any one generalizing about what your boy friend can or cannot do is no help. Yes, he will get at least a brief letter writing time but if he isn't prepared or possibly a goofball he might not get to take advantage of it. This is a good opportunity for you to realize his priorities. Do keep sending him letters. Nothing smelly or too mushy just chat on about everyday details. Be patient and see what happens. If he didn't write because he used his time for something else or screwed up then dump him and use your patience to allow for a better man to come along.|`|AA11481224	bear in mind your a girlfriend <br>  <br>  hes being stripped down mentally and told to sever all ties that arent  family<br>  <br>  and thats  you<br>  your considered a distraction and basically you dont exist<br>  <br>  he is considered single<br>  by now you should have gotten something<br>  get the address and write to him and see if he responds if not move on<br>  he most likely  has already|`|IdtzdpqGaa	They do stay pretty busy, but there is time available to make a call and write, sometimes the recruit will feel so overwhelmed that they don't think they have time, I would recommend you sending a letter since you have time and that may encourage him to write.
eyXunHyKaa	He can take you to court, but unless he finds some loophole he won't win.  A gift is a gift, as you said, he has no legal right to ask for it back.|`|AA12103453	The wireless network he could probably ask for it back, but not the net access. I mean come on he had it put in and used it(I'm guessing) so Courts would likely throw that out. If he put in a wireless router and stuff and you didn't give it back THAT you may have to give back. It's still his and he was using it there as well, which means he could argue that part wasn't a gift. The computer sounds like more of a gray area to me. He traded with you, debatable about the gift idea. Anyway I'd just give him most of his stuff back, at least beyond costs(like cost of the net access) and save trouble. As to the computer if he wants to go to Court over it and you want it then let it go to Court.|`|57e2f61534cb280dd3b9f69e82a68f67aa	Anyone can sue anyone in small claims, the question lies can he be successful or would be seen as a vindictive ex in the court eyes?<br>  <br>  I would think he has a long shot at best|`|01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	A gift is a gift.  Also, if you swapped your computer for his...he can't undo the deal.  He can file a small claims suit (anyone can) but he will lose.  His only way to win would be to show that you were BUYING the computer and his services and that you failed to pay.  No judge is going to take is word for it though...he'd have to have evidence of an agreement to that effect.|`|1VaH8D3Raa	It was not a gift it was a trade <br>  .<br>  Like bartering <br>  .<br>  Between two persons <br>  .<br>  I'll give you this if you give me that <br>  .<br>  A payment was made nothing was given for free<br>  .<br>  If it had been then there might be grounds for a disagreement to be settled by a court of law<br>  .|`|33121fc0c2bea9ea4d671e5e2438e785aa	Gift is a gift.

Not rocket science!! Give him his router back too! There's not that much equipment with a wireless system! That's why they call it wireless!!! Just get YOUR computer back!! NOW! if he doesn't have it anymore, I would think it only fair you should be able to keep his!! Otherwise, he can give you the money so you can buy a new one!|`|geamDWBtaa	he sounds like a freaking loser, well anyone can take anyone to court but the judge would probably just look at him and laugh and if he loses he will probably have to pay, if he gave you stuff and no written stuff saying you owe him money..........i would say your ok and tell him to go fly a kite..........|`|ED4nlW4raa	He can take you to court, but he won't win.

X4mxKUvgaa	Yes, you can just know that depending on the state the remedies may be different then the EEOC.  Also I do not know of any federal preemption written in that would prevent you from suing under both.<br>  However there may be some limits placed on by the states.  For example in CA the DFEH is required to accept the matter for investigation before the EEOC will take the matter on.<br>  <br>  However as a practical point you are not likely to recover under both state and federal for the full amount that you are looking to recover.  It is still possible though.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Your best bet is to contact an actual employment/labor lawyer.  Check your local Bar Association for a referral number to find a lawyer who may take the matter on for you.|`|lxtA7iKXaa	why not do both?|`|F6yfJSr9aa	I don't see why not.

He can return to his home country, apply to college here as a foreign student, and come legally on a student visa. Even community colleges accept foreign students these days.  If he entered without inspection, there is no way for him to become legal while still living in the U.S.  If he entered with a visa and overstayed, he may be able to become legal if he marries a U.S. citizen or has another eligible U.S.-citizen relative who will sponsor him.|`|oZqoxgc7aa	Fill out the application at USCIS and await the outcome.
fFpYZwEMaa	I used to work for the government and then they closed down the repair facility that I was working at and transferred me to a new repair facility.<br>  <br>  Since they displaced me and gave me another job in another part of the country, I received the salary (which ended up being an increase in pay) that was the rate of pay for that area.<br>  <br>  I was a WG-8 step 5 at my first facility and maintained it upon going to the new facility.<br>  <br>  They also have something called the Displaced Employee Program.  I believe you would still get the pay rate of where you would end up at (even though I'm not positive on that).<br>  <br>  If you are doing this of your own volition, then you will end up getting the pay of a GS7 or 9.<br>  <br>  Of course, you could always see if they would be willing to give your poistion as a GS-11 back and, in turn, you would get your pay back.  <br>  <br>  Of course, the GS-11 pay of where this job is at could be lower (or higher) than what you're getting now (if it's in another part of the country).  <br>  <br>  In other words, be your own advocate and fight for the pay of a GS-11 by explaining how valuable you would be to them.<br>  <br>  The good news is this though.  My brother took a job with the VA Hospital (and this is his first government job) and he moved up the ladder quickly because of his experience.<br>  <br>  He started out as a GS-11 and is already a GS-13 or GS-14 (and he's only been at the VA Hospital for two or three years and has received a $5000.00 bonus recently).<br>  <br>  This could end up working out for you (as far as getting your GS-11 position back) if you prove to be a valuable asset to where you are going.|`|HXIIbVN8aa	I have never heard it referred to as the FERAL government but, when you think of it, it is an apt description.|`|UqLEMXAgaa	A GS11 is like an Army Colonel in pay.<br>  <br>  You didn't say what step you are.<br>  Salary: $54,367 – $70,844 <br>  <br>  I live on less than $3k per year.<br>  <br>  I think you will survive on GS7 or 9 pay.<br>  <br>  Try living on $243 a month...|`|dLLk3e2eaa	Why on earth would you take a GS7 or 9 when you are already an 11???  the locality differentials are given for a reason.

The federal government is a notorious waster of money and funding research that is already funded by private money is just a waste of our tax dollars.|`|FKYJ5K34aa	No.  It will only force taxpayers to pay for something that has been on-going anyway.

We are already so far in debt we will never dig our way out, and with Obama trying to "redistribute the wealth" (in other words....socialize) our nation, even our grandchildren will never be able to dig themselves out.  <br>  Do you realize that it took Congress over 200 years to spend the first Trillion Dollars and it only took the Obama administration 1 month to double that spending?  <br>  Think of it this way.... If you spent $1000 per day it would take about 3 years to spend $1Million.  If you spent $1000 per day and you started when Jesus Christ was on the Earth, you STILL would not have spent $1Billion.

ApRXXfW6aa	Your best bet would be to talk with the department's recruiter. I would say to apply now and let them know you're expecting to graduate shortly (then provide them with a copy of your diploma). A general timeline is as follows:<br>  <br>  1. Send in application<br>  2. Scheduled for written test, oral interview, physical agility test<br>  3. Polygraph exam<br>  4. Medical exam<br>  5. Psychological exam<br>  6. Assume you pass all of the above, you'll be hired by an agency (generally, they pay you while you're in the academy - at a defined pay rate, as a cadet/recruit). That pay is generally fixed.<br>  7. Graduation - you're now being paid as a bottom step deputy, and you have your Basic Academy certificate. Depending on the agency, they might start applying an extra 2-1/2 % or 5% to your pay for the degree.<br>  8. Upon a year's paid time, you can now apply for your Basic POST certificate - this is where the education starts to pay off. As you progress in your career, additional education (BA/BS, masters degree and various POST training courses) all contribute points towards getting your Intermediate or Advanced POST certificate - with a corresponding pay increase.<br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  Calif Deputy|`|YbjT1uERaa	WELL IF YOU HAVE 2 MONTHS LEFT IT DOESNT MATTER YOU CAN APPLY NOW BECAUSE YOUR RIGHT BY THE TIME U DO GO THREW THE WHOLE PROCESS U WILL HAVE IT.

AA10604086	I don;t think you have a problem. I can;t speak for FL, but here's waht happened in Pennsylvania.<br>  In PA, there was a program, not too long ago, if you were the victim of a plant closing and were unemployed, you could attend Jr college( 1 semester free) and still collect unemployment.. (( I got a semester out of it .) The only restriction was, that you were actively looking for work and were able to work.<br>    I asked the college, " what happens if I get a job and it interferes with my schedule!"

Having a father is important in any child's life, its no different than us that believe in  Yahweh God is our father and we are to follow his rules or suffer the consequences.|`|EbsekS7yaa	Democrat voters|`|3RIeRxHVaa	In my opinion it's a combination of apathy and laziness.  I'm a 40 yr old single mom, and have seriously wrestled with this issue.  From my vantage point the apathy of people in authority to do their very best is easily identified in fatherlessness.  Fathers are the foundational glue that holds society together; absentee or weak fathers, (weak in that they do not take their responsibility seriously to train up healthy children of integrity) is the single most powerful ingredient in the decline of America.  <br>  You might find the book Fatherless America helpful ... "Never before in this country have so many children been voluntarily abandoned by their fathers. Never before have so many children grown up without knowing what it means to have a father ... Fatherlessness is the most harmful demographic trend of this generation. It is the leading cause of declining child well-being in our society. It is also the engine driving our most urgent social  problems, from crime to adolescent pregnancy to child sexual abuse to domestic violence against women. Yet, despite its scale and social consequences, fatherlessness is a problem that is  frequently ignored or denied ... If this trend continues, fatherlessness is likely to change the shape of our society."<br>  In my opinion, the intact family God designed (God, father, mother, children, extended family) is supposed to offer basic benefits - psychological, social, economic, educational, and moral.  Family at the foundation of our nation was disjointed due to death by starvation and disease, but the family made it with out excessive horror stories of rape or abuse, because of Christian values and then the emerging successful society comprised of fathers teaching their son their trade, thus their work ethic, perpetuating a healthy society.<br>  BUT  I am not with out hope, I lovingly and prayerfully train my son.  The Bible says, Train up a child in the way he should go and when he is grown, he will not depart from it.  He knows I value integrity, justice, honor, love, but above all humility first to admit fault and forgive others.

AA11494150	It is possible he was sent somewhere and then called off. Sometimes dispatch will send several officers for safety reasons, or because they don't know who is closest. Once someone arrives on scene, that officer may call everyone else off. <br>  <br>  It is also possible he was intentionally pacing you. Police are allowed to speed when gaining evidence of another speed violation. If he saw you were gaining on him, continued to increase his speed, and you continued to gain, he can accurately testify you were going faster than he was, and write you for his speed.<br>  <br>  Even if he was not doing anything official, him speeding does not justify your speed and can not be used for a defense. <br>  <br>  I disagree with the other poster, this is not entrapment. That occurs when you coerce someone to do something they would not normally do. His actions in did nothing to put undue pressure on you.<br>  <br>  No, I'm not agreeing with this method, nor am I justifying his actions. I am just giving you the points of law.|`|28498a903efb7372e241c2b455610196aa	Bottom line, you were speeding, he in fact was pacing you. deal with it, learn from it, you made your bed so lay in it. No excuses, no whining.|`|ITF52tu9aa	He can do this and issue you a ticket. <br>  <br>  However, you have a legitimate argument for entrapment (his lights siren wasn't on)- especially if you're speedometer was broken so you 'knew' that by following an officer you wouldn't be breaking the law. Good luck with that one, especially since you didn't slow when he slowed. <br>  <br>  Always keep the cops in front unless they are going below the speed limit...|`|l2MjVVpRaa	1. You were speeding.<br>  <br>  2. You got a ticket.<br>  <br>  3.

It is a dangerous world out there.|`|SutVrwoHaa	I'm going to go with Trooper on this one about entrapment ( congrats on top contributor btw).  I  think the first poster may have been onto something however.  Right now you have the ticket and while I agree with you on a lot of your points about cops speeding think about how much traffic would back up if they went down the Interstate at the posted speed and not a mile over.  If you were around during the early days of the 55mph speed limits cops traveling at 55 could back traffic up for miles.  <br>  <br>  Damage control.  You didnt say what the ticket was for 85/70 or what.  If it is that high you may be looking at a lot of points and most surely higher insurance.  I see one possible out if you havent admitted to speeding to the officer,  if you have then you may be stuck with it. <br>  If you did not admit to speeding or say how fast the officer or yourself was going you can try pleading guilty to a lesser charge. This will vary from state to state.  I would try "improper or defective equipement"  since it sounds like your speedometer was broken and you were following the officer,  he didnt have his emergency equipment activated and you had no idea how fast he was going and certainly no intention of breaking any laws.  This is probably a long shot but most likely your only defense if you haven't admitted to speeding.  You may want to consult a lawyer who could better articulate it for you.  Many times they can set this plea up for you. I would rather pay them once than my insurance company for the next few years.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps.|`|tPvjd8qqaa	You fail to realize that you were watching him and only him.  He could have seen someone when he started out that he thought was speeding and then eventually caught up to them to start pacing them.  But having you behind him going the same speed, well, you then made yourself the target.  <br>  There is another reason for stopping you.  If you decide to follow the officer, he doesn't know why you are and will/could perceive you as a possible threat.  There are people out there that don't like the police, as I'm certain you already know.  The police are trained to look for those people and if someone like you starts following at a high rate of speed, well I think you get the picture.  <br>  Now, if you see an officer doing something that you think is against the law or against policy, you are free to notify his superiors.  Just be sure to be able to identify the officer, the time, the date, and location.  If you can't identify the officer then the car is the next best thing.  Most agencies depend on the good will of the citizens to approve funding.  No good will means no funding, so if there is a problem they will most likely take care of it.

They are the ones who will process your ticket and will know all the laws and regulation. You should also ask the courts if you are allowed to take a driving school class.

In 2006, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said: "Remembering is a necessary rebuke to those who say the Holocaust never happened or has been exaggerated. Holocaust denial is the work of bigots; we must reject their false claims whenever, wherever and by whomever they are made." Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner Elie Wiesel calls the Holocaust "the most documented tragedy in recorded history. Never before has a tragedy elicited so much witness from the killers, from the victims and even from the bystanders—millions of pieces here in the museum what you have, all other museums, archives in the thousands, in the millions." He made a similar statement on a special edition of the The Oprah Winfrey Show after his final trip to Auschwitz, along with host Oprah Winfrey.<br>  <br>  In January 2007, the United Nations General Assembly condemned "without reservation any denial of the Holocaust", though Iran disassociated itself from the resolution.|`|QqxrVVnlaa	I think someone is winding you up mate.

They want you to "buy" their product... in their cases that's their particular branch of the service. They want you to sign up before you leave because they know that the chances of you coming back are slim.<br>  <br>  Third: to answer the first part of your question, do your homework. Go to the Web sites of the branches and exhaust every link you can get to. Find out everything you can. Remember though, the information will be pretty much limited to the good stuff about the branch. That's not to say any branch is perfect. It's just that they know that everything else you've heard (in the media and school) is probably negative, and they only have your attention for a short time, and they don't want to waste a minute of that time rehashing something negative.<br>  <br>  Fourth: you have to make your own decision.

However, a baby still lives for a period of time after the mother has died and if removed from the womb intact prior to the natural birth the baby can survive for a period of time.  Therefore, it cannot possibly be the "Woman's Body" or "Just Tissue", because the baby is defying all of the basic rules that would make either of those statements valid.|`|v8elYTNxaa	"Dear professor,<br>  <br>  My beliefs are a travesty.

Not every Muslim is described as a terrorist, they are just unfortunately of the same people where terrorists come from.<br>  Japanese-Americans of WW2 were carefully watched because they could have been enemy, it isn't because they were Japanese and the Americans wanted to do that, it's because they happened to be of the same people that were the American's enemy.<br>  And yes the Mumbai attackers were terrorists too.|`|vCvsXbOCaa	first of all Purohit is not a terrorist he has not yet been proven.<br>  second he has not stared as your Jihadis do . he is the product to retaliate the innocent people killed by muslims .All over the world it is muslims who kill the non muslim people in the name of Islam what they call is jihad.|`|rkZhVpvgaa	Not all Muslims are terrorists.<br>  The outfits who declare themselves terrorists / jehadis are called terrorists.

You know why ? because of Media.<br>  The only source of attention is provided by media.<br>  It's the media which plays a vital role in making and non-making of terrorist.

You must make sure she goes to school, is fed, looked after, etc. If the mom makes noise and causes trouble then I would go to the authorities.

Also bring your cancelled checks showing how much you pay in rent. If you also have a copy of the lease agreement showing that you are able to use the club house then bring that to court too.|`|k8ivyYfaaa	Not sure what state you live in, but some have courts specifically to hear landlord/tenant issues.  However, this is a breach of contract, so if nothing else, you can sue her in small claims/state/county court.

Or is that in the contract? Or is that pretty much implied? If it is, then you MAY have a case in reducing your rent by a certain amount, as well as a refund for prior payments. If you were told, and you can prove that other tenants were told as well, you may also have a case. However, as the amounts are relatively small, consult one of those free legal aid societies for advice.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	Find your lease and look at what it says.  If it talks about the landlord paying the HOA fees and you having access to the clubhouse then she is in breach of your lease agreement, if not then you are screwed.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	I would say this is a breach of contract.

There are advantages in being recognized as EU citizens with EU passports, so go ahead and apply for French passports for them.  Once you have these you may wish to register them as French rather than American residents of the UK which would enable them to stay even after the visas they have as US citizens run out.

They are incompetent idiots.|`|G6yyceAxaa	the source is bad. it is a blog website, and if you read the first response blog, the quote somebody that worked for Hitler saying "a lie repeated long enough eventually becomes the truth".<br>  <br>  but, i think that if the only thing this guy can think about is how his party can win, as opposed to how he can represent his constituents, then he needs to get booted out of congress.  this is not his job, he is a representative of the people, and i am sure people in his district wouldn't agree with his train of thought.  maybe if he was READING THE STIMULUS PACKAGE instead, he may be more effective.|`|PhTQn6ycaa	It will do nothing but show the republican party for what it is.

His parents loved him & felt so sorry for anything bad that happened to him, they wanted him to be forgiven. They spoiled him & felt sorry for him. I think this may have been their pattern b/c of the lose of his little sister when he was so young. So it is understandable.<br>  <br>  Obama has had a pattern of inherited the biggest challenges in life. I can't imagine living in a white world with black skin & a black father but he did well for himself. I really believe he is going to do well. I think he has had all kinds of things happen in his life but he always took the high & when you do that it is as if a level has been established. He will be safe b/c this level protects him. So mean people say things about him. Have you watched the past year, it doesn't matter. President Obama is a winner no matter what obstacles he has to overcome.|`|AA10079277	It is hard to say.  As of now, Obama has managed to manipulate the stimulus bill in such a way, that for the first time in our history, 50% of all Americans pay no taxes at all.  That means that for 50% of the population, since they have no stake in the cost of government, they are completely not affected by how much the government spends.    They have no reason to not vote for him again, even if things continue to fail.|`|JinXSnnMaa	Do you honestly think anyone can undo all the failures and mistakes of the past 8 years in less than 4? <br>  <br>  Even if Obama struggles with major issues, the republican'ts are in such a state of disarray, it will take a miracle to fine tune a candidate in order to take him on.|`|c3vPZfghaa	People vote their Pocket Books.<br>  if the economy isn't showing signs of rebounding by 2012, chances are, control will switch hands.<br>  Now you know why Republicans are cheering for failure.|`|4AxBMYpUaa	hopefully he will be voted out if his policies fail.<br>  I'm all for Obama but yes, if his policies fail then there would be no reason to keep him around. <br>  But I don't think they will fail.|`|BsQcplTQaa	If they fail he should be impeached.

Bush was re-elected based on fear of terrorism. Fear of a worsening economy will not have the same effect after the final spending tally of this administration is known. In reality Obama has set himself up for failure with his grand proclamations and platitudes of change. He managed to energize the dreamer set, but the problem with rousing this base is that they will turn on you in short order if you do not produce.|`|AA10681117	Whether his policies fail or not will be hard to determine and will most likely be played out in the court of public opinion.

He didn't hesitate to take credit for getting troops out of Iraq though. He thinks we're all too stupid to realize that the only reason he can do this is because there is not even any combat going on there anymore....Thanks to the freaking surge, which he to this day denies was a success.|`|POygTyTAaa	Obama hasn't even been in office two months.  I think that it goes back further than George W.  I remember reading a book written in the early 1980's by an economics professor who was questioning  the "supply side" economics of the Reagan administration.  He said that you can't keep beefing up supply and not have the country burst.  (I guess the term "bubble" hadn't been used yet, it was a "where's the beef" country.)  He predicted by the first of the millenium that the stock market, the banking industry, the housing market, and the oil industry would all be in serious trouble.  His predictions weren't too far off.  I am not blaming it all on Reagan either.  Bill Clinton signed NAFTA, and that began the free trade movement, and the opening of minds to outsource America.|`|7UqccTp6aa	No. He is accountable for the things he has done, and what is happening to us because of what he has done.<br>  He also needs to quit crying " He started it" that shows how immature he really is.|`|f74fb35875fa4e25e1470711558d7f65aa	Well Bush in his last press conference after eight full years in office blamed it all on the previous administration, so I am not sure how you can pass the buck forward just yet!|`|Vh9CbtLUaa	Remember when your mother said; I don't care which one of you made this mess, all of you get it cleaned now!|`|um87XJvmaa	Not yet.

There is a huge gray area in which both presidents take the blame for some for economic problems. The president itself cannot responsible for everything that goes wrong with the US, frankly because a president does not have the power to affect everything. <br>  <br>  People that solely blame Bush for all of our economic problems have no concept of checks and balances and just like the sound of their own voice saying that Bush did all this. Did Bush tell people to buy homes they could not afford? Last time I checked, he tried to regulate Fannie and Freddie's irresponsible loan habits back in 2003. <br>  <br>  Should be blame Obama now? The answer is not yet. Give him a full year, which allows a business cycle to complete then we will have an answer.

One of those calendars, termed the "long count calendar" stops on 12/21/2012. Does this mean the end of time, or the start of a new time? Who knows. One thing that cannot be disputed, is that the Mayan were THOUSANDS of years ahead of their time. They were able to calculate, with incredible accuracy, perplexing mathematical equations. They are credited as the first people to accurately determine the appropriate length of days and years. Coincidentally, they were big on the summer and winter Solstice, and 12/21/2012 coincides with the Winter Solstice. <br>  <br>  Another consideration in determining if the world will end 12/21/2012 is the Chinese I Ching, know to others as the Book of Change. Considered by many to be the oldest book in the world, the images of the I Ching are associated with numbers. Some mathematical geniuses have claimed to have "cracked the code" citing that the book accurately predicts nearly every catastrophic event that has ever taken place. Since the book's early days, it has been thought of as capable of predicting the changes in the future. <br>  <br>  When trying to decide if the world will end on 12/21/2012 consider the "web bots" of relatively recent fame. Originally invented to survey the "mood" of the planet on the internet, in hopes of predicting stock market performance. Supposedly, they've been very accurate. Some claim the machines predicted a major happening on 9/11....yes that 9/11. <br>  <br>   has been said that a pole shift is coming. North becomes South and vice versa. Some, including Einstein all those years ago, say that this is in fact going on, and may be responsible for the weather changes happening globally. <br>  <br>  Some state the changes going on at Yellowstone Park are just the beginning. The earth will continue to shift, ground will continue to move, pushed up by oceans of underground lava.

The Official 9/11 Story is nothing short of a "big lie" used to help cover up the crime and then shift the blame to Middle Easteners. <br>  <br>  President Bush, with the help of his Neocon buddies attempted to take complete control of the U.S. by decapitating the Legislative branch of the federal government: They are treasonous murders and would be dictators too, if they had not blundered in their attack of the Capital with Flight 93. They left plenty of evidence at each of the attack sites that implicates them to the crimes. The Following is a summary of what really happened.<br>  <br>  <br>  World Trade Center Buildings<br>  <br>  The World Trade Center buildings were brought down by controlled demolition after being attacked by aircraft. The only evidence our government provided that Osama confessed to the crime is fake. Most every video taken of the towers shows explosives just before the towers imploded. Traces of explosives were also found at ground zero. <br>  <br>  PENTAGON<br>  <br>  There is also strong evidence to support a Douglas A-3 Skywarrior armed with a missile hit the Pentagon. Witnesses say, the U.S. military secretly had Raytheon Co. refit an A-3 Skywarrior with new jet engines, a missile, and a Global Hawk guidance system, just prior to 9/11. Both the jet engine housing as well as a "front end rotor head", found at the crash site, have been identified as belonging to a Pratt & Whitney JT8D jet engine, supporting the witnesses claim. This engine does not fit the commercial Boeing 757 that is said to have hit the Pentagon.<br>  <br>  <br>  FLIGHT 93<br>  <br>  United Airlines Flight 93 did not crash as a result of a struggle between the passengers and the alleged hijackers, but in fact was shot down by the North Dakota Air Guards flying F-16's. On orders from Adj. General of the State of North Dakota and in opposition to V.P. Cheney's stand down orders, Major Rick Gibney spotted the airline flying on remote, headed toward Washington D.C. and shot it down. This is why debris, including human remains, rained on areas several miles away from the crash site.<br>  <br>  <br>  now there is only one fact we need to know about 9/11 and that is: none of the alleged hijackers were at any of the three airports on the morning of 9/11, and if they were not at the airports it was impossible for them to have carried out the attacks. The good news is, the government cannot prove otherwise. <br>  <br>  “There are those who will insist that they have seen on television video surveillance tapes of the hijackers of 9/11 and are satisfied with the official explanation of what happened on that fateful day. <br>  <br>  However, these people are confused by the tape repeatedly shown on TV of two of the alleged hijackers (Mohammad Atta being one of them) passing through a security checkpoint at Portland Maine International Airport to take a connecting flight to Boston on the morning of 11 September 2001. <br>  <br>  This Portland tape has no time-stamp, which makes it suspect. Also, even IF the tape were genuine, it does not place either of the two young Arabs at Logan International Airport. <br>  <br>  Nearly all Americans were lulled into believing that the Portland, Maine tape was sufficient proof when it was not. People were mesmerized by the repeated showing of this tape on TV and in their emotional state did not realize exactly what they were looking at and what they weren't looking at. <br>  <br>  Also, yet another tape was shown in the 24 hour interval leading to the official release of the 9/11 Commission Report; however, this tape, released to the news media by the South Carolina law firm Motley Rice LLC, was almost immediately withdrawn because it quickly became apparent that it was bogus. This Motley Rice surveillance tape purportedly showed two young Arabs boarding flight 77 at Dulles International Airport on the morning of 9/11. But again, just like the Portland Maine tape, there is no time-stamp, which makes it inadmissible in a court of law. This Motley Rice film was never shown again because of the critical eyes of researchers, many of whom preserved copies of the mysterious tape in their computers. <br>  <br>  In consideration of the foregoing, one must conclude that no tape has EVER been shown that reveals ANY of the passengers boarding the 9/11 flights out of Boston's Logan, Newark's Liberty and Washington's Dulles international airports. <br>  <br>  One must also ask, if the 9/11 surveillance tapes at these airports do in fact exist, why haven't we seen them? And if they do not even exist, how can this be explained?”<br>  <br>  Some facts/unanswered questions:<br>  <br>  Mohammed Atta's passport is found undamaged & UnSorched at Ground Zero, while all the hijackers' bodies were incinerated<br>  <br>  - No videos except for 1 of Flight AA77 crashing into the Pentagon, and you can't see a Boeing 757 in it, while all other Pentagon videos are not released, and videos from nearby businesses (CITGO gas station + Sheraton Hotel) confiscate  within minutes from  the attack<br>  <br>  - No crash wreckage of engines, wings, tail, fuselage, luggage, airline seats, or even aircraft parts with serial numbers at AA77 or UA93 crash sites, which makes them the first in aviation history to vaporize<br>  <br>  Cellphone calls impossible above 8K feet, and UA93 was at cruising altitude of 35K feet, so calls were probably made using voice morphing technology<br>  - 3 Black boxes found by 2 First responders at WTC, but later confiscated & the government claims all were missing<br>  - WTC7 collapse not even explained or mentioned in 911 Report, plus the Larry Silverstein televised public admission that it was "pulled" by "them"- All testimony by firefighters & witnesses of multiple explosions in WTC eliminated from the 911 report<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I first thought 9-11 was an inside job on Sept. 12th, 2001. It seemed awful suspicious to me that they had not an knowing of what was going to happen and yet by the next day knew everything..all the attackers names, flight training history and even what libraries they had used which I don't even know how they would know this as some libraries do not require ID to use Internet nor have cameras..and yet we supposedly knew this.<br>  <br>  then it came out that other countries had warned us and that Bush had warnings.<br>  <br>  Few things other than steel survived in big pieces and yet there was a hijacker ID, how convenient and now many of the so called hijackers are coming forward alive and saying they had lost their passports prior to 9-11<br>  <br>  Then I heard 5 hours radio show by maker of inplanesite that was most compelling.<br>  <br>  Now I have seen loose change and only two days ago watched mysteries911 DVD that was given to me three times with family members. This DVD is most compelling. I was particularly struck by the slant cut steel beams looking like one that were wired as the explosives cut on a slant so the building falls inward and doesn't damage surrounding structures. Slant cut beams with evidence of the use of thermite.<br>  <br>  If that many websites are out there, hopefully, the American people will wake up in time, not trust their government leaders, and do something while there is still time.

wsTK80H6aa	I'm an atheist and I'm fine with abortions. <br>  <br>  I think the Bible does hold the answer for Christians on this subject. Gen 2:7 the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.<br>  <br>  He was not a living being until he received the breath of life!|`|iZEHA854aa	Your question begs a discussion on morality.<br>  1) Is it moral to rape? You ask, "Do you think ones faith should determine laws to be followed by all?" If the majority can not set certain absolutes, then why bother having government? Why have laws?<br>  A civilized people need to have points of reference from which acceptable and unacceptable conduct can be determined.<br>  Taking the life of the unborn child (note, I do not refer to it as an embryo or fetus, as these terms make the child seem less human) is murder. This premise is especially true in "near-birth"cases, where the doctor keeps the child from passing out into the world where legal protections exist. It is destroyed out of the womb but not yet clear of the birth canal.<br>  It is little wonder that there are those who continue to fight against abortion. Who else can stand up for those who are voiceless?<br>  Who else will demand justice instead of death for the innocent?<br>  <br>  Let's pretend there is not a god.<br>  Let's further pretend there no longer are any laws based upon faith beliefs.<br>  Shall we then say that whatever the majority deems acceptable, should be then allowed?<br>  Well, there was a time when the majority had no problem with slavery.<br>  There was a time when incest was not illegal.<br>  Should we return to those periods in human history?<br>  No, we should not.<br>  So, then what shall we use for our points of reference? Without laws based upon faith, what ultimate laws shall we use?<br>  Now you can see why the non-believer's claim that faith based laws should be abolished is a step closer to anarchy.<br>  If you want to help woman have less pregnancies, help them resist the temptation for having unprotected sex. Otherwise, get them to understand that although they do have a right of self-determination, it is not an absolute right, for the moment they conceive, that right becomes a joint right between them and their unborn child. Once the child is born, let them abort their parental right and give the child up for adoption.|`|56383c92c8bbc510079c94b1baf7d3d9aa	First, having "faith" does not necessarily mean being a part of a church. I have "faith" that my show will come on thursday night. Religion is based on traditions. Spirituality is based on faith. A citizen of the US has the obligation by birth to follow the rules of the country, or they could end up using taxpayers money to stay in a nice little prison. They also have the right to leave and go to a country that suits their needs.|`|97ef16e9c13a4597a175d5786da95200aa	First, separation of chuch and state means keeping the government out of the church, not the other way around. <br>  <br>  Second, I oppose partial birth abortions, and therefore oppose any "pro-choice" groups that support it. Read up on the proceedure and you will agree.|`|xBnkJNGnaa	I don't believe in any sort of higher power, but I am very pro-life.<br>  <br>  Abortion has nothing to do with religion, it has to do with the life of a child, not God.|`|klj3cOFPaa	My faith doesn't determine my views on abortion.  But then, I'm an atheist.|`|QlrIUIfOaa	No, secular laws should be just that, secular.<br>  <br>  The call to Christians is to their behavior in the face of events.  I am a Christian and I oppose all laws on abortion.  Fellow Christians, want to reduce abortion?  Educate and adopt.  <br>  <br>  I understand the call to adopt is hard and the temptation to pass ineffective laws is easy.  I don't believe that is what we are called to do.  Can't adopt? Contribute.  Can't contribute? Volunteer.<br>  <br>  But don't lie to yourself that ineffective laws, that are generally ignored, answers Christ's call.|`|35985e59ca68529733224255fd3dabc6aa	I believe that with all things, God wanted us to have conversation with each other to discuss, dissect, and determine what His Word says to us about a specific situation.<br>  <br>  If there was truly only one interpretation of His Word, then there would not be as many as 600 or more different denominations operating as His church--apparently with His blessing because they have flourished side by side.<br>  <br>  That said, I do not believe that one's faith should "determine laws to be followed BY ALL."  However, where there is agreement, yes.<br>  <br>  I do think that a non-religious person should follow the laws of the land, regardless of whether they think it is faith based.  Only where the law is decidedly unjust is civil disobedience acceptable.  However, even then, those who practice civil disobedience should do so with the expectation of being held accountable in the short term under the "unjust" law.|`|MMQ7SdvDaa	I am a born-again reverent agnostic, I personally don't have a dog in the hunt. I have two kids and have been fixed, and the wife is frigid so sex is a non-issue. :-) <br>  <br>  Personally I'd prefer to see people who are on our welfare dole to be implanted with the Norplant and it removed only after they have gainful employment for 5 years. I think it should be mandated for woman who charged with a drug offense, save the baby a lifetime of "issues" related to fetal alcohol/drug birth. <br>  <br>  Abortion is a different matter, by the time a person realizes they are pregnant then it's too late. Abortion only in the case of rape, or incest, and never state funded, and top it off that no welfare for mother or child.  Heartless? You bet.. it's called responsibility.. Something sheep and children of today no very little about. <br>  <br>  A religious issue? No. a fiscal issue.|`|AA11526235	I took more than one biology class and I don't see what the big deal is.  Sure, you can take a human life whether you're an abortionist or not.  I just think we have to treat everyone the same under the law, so why put an age limit and a sexual gender on who can say what?  Post partum people get a day in court as do the mentally challenged before they're sentenced.  It takes two to make a baby, so why does only one get to decide?  If a fetus or embryo gets killed during the commission of a crime, manslaughter or murder are probable charges against the perpetrator.  All those laws must change, or the abortion process must change.  It has nothing to do with religion except for "being my brother's keeper."  I would rather pick and choose who dies.|`|47eiwyMLaa	1) Even if I didn't believe in any religion, I would still think abortion is wrong based on science and the inherent tendency to preserve my species. <br>  <br>  2) Jesus was not alive when the bible was written.<br>  <br>  3) There is nothing in the Constitution about separation of church and state...our right to practice any religion is guaranteed by the bill of rights in the Constitution.<br>  <br>  4) Faith is believing in something unseen...like air. Faith influences one's religion. Morality is influenced by one's religion. Actions are influenced by morality. Actions influence how laws are created for proposal...a variety of other factors can influence any of the above at any time.<br>  <br>  5) Regardless of how a law originates, all people of all religions or those who claim to not have a religion, have the ability to influence laws. If you don't like it, amend it or fight it. If the law is passed anyways, you have to abide by it because you had your chance and your say.|`|CbeNLpb3aa	There is no separation of church and state - try reading the first amendment.<br>  <br>  Well, he wasn't around for the old testament, either.

I think a major problem that will definitely impact global as well as US population is hunger and starvation. I believe there will be a famine that lasts several years and that will cause a lot of grief and anxiety worldwide as the poverty spreads to even some of the best areas in the world. And I believe everything will get worse before it ever gets better.|`|4JneH0QDaa	you could start by leaving the place you know..<br>  then they'll have enough room.<br>  it sounds cheeky, but you can't stop people from coming.<br>  it's doesn't feel fair.<br>  if you give them what they want back in their hometowns they won't bother to leave.<br>  sorry if i sounded cruel, but it really suprized me.|`|AA11851828	This reminds me of 1960 when they(scaremongers) were saying that by the year 2000 there would be standing room only.

ITF52tu9aa	Found below regarding Florida Parole Hearings. Google your state's parole board, find the info your seeking... <br>  <br>  If you are to speak- <br>  1. Carefully list what the perpetrator did, the effect it had, and why the time served does not redress the harms done to the victim or society. <br>  <br>  2. Also state the potential harm caused by release (early or otherwise) . <br>  <br>  Also google your State's Victim's Rights Groups and conrtact for advice. <br>  <br>  I have done much work with victims and am happy to help in any way if I support your cause (would have to know the story). <br>  <br>  <a href="https://fpc.state.fl.us/Victims.htm" rel="nofollow">https://fpc.state.fl.us/Victims.htm</a><br>  DO I HAVE A RIGHT TO ATTEND A HEARING? <br>  Yes. A victim has the right to attend all hearings and speak at parole and conditional medical hearings. Families of victims are also entitled to attend and speak at the hearing. Written comments may be submitted for consideration prior to a conditional release hearing. Victims should be aware that anything they say at a public hearing becomes public record. <br>  <br>  WHO ELSE CAN ATTEND A HEARING? <br>  Other persons permitted to attend may include the inmate's family and friends, attorneys, members of the media (cameras and recording equipment are allowed), or any other interested party. <br>  <br>  CAN SOMEONE ACCOMPANY ME TO THE HEARING? <br>  Yes. Anyone may attend parole hearings in the State of Florida.<br>  <br>  HOW DO I KNOW WHEN A HEARING WILL BE HELD? <br>  If you are a victim of a crime in Florida, you have the right to provide input to the Commission during the deliberation process, whether parole is being considered or terms and conditions for conditional release are being established. The Commission has a toll free number you may call to find out the status of a case. That number is 1-800-435-8286 and is listed in red on this web page. If you already know the status of the inmate’s case and wish to appear and speak, you may call (850) 488-1293 to request permission or simply submit a request in writing to:<br>  <br>  The Florida Parole Commission<br>  2601 Blair Stone Road<br>  Building C, 3rd Floor<br>  Tallahassee, FL 32399-2450<br>  <br>  Attn: Work Processing <br>  <br>  The Commission will provide written notification of the date, time, and location of the hearing. <br>  <br>  Any written correspondence submitted by a victim is considered confidential according to Florida's public record laws, s. 945.10, Florida Statutes. All correspondence from victims is stamped confidential and becomes a permanent part of the inmate record.<br>  <br>  WHEN WILL I BE PERMITTED TO SPEAK AT A HEARING? <br>  The Commission publishes an agenda listing all cases scheduled to be heard on that particular day. You will be assisted through the process by the Commission’s Victims Coordinator. When the offender’s case is called, those speaking in favor of the inmate speak first, with the Victim, or those opposed, providing testimony at the end. The Commission does not allow rebuttal of any testimony.<br>  <br>  HOW WILL I KNOW IF AN INMATE IS BEING RELEASED? <br>  The Department of Corrections notifies all victims, that can be located, of an inmate’s release from incarceration.|`|AA11579568	You can attend the hearing and offer testimony.|`|DJo0E2I2aa	not much honestly, if you were a witness to whatever he did, you might be able to testify against him, if not, there's nothing you can do

M7GnRpd0aa	The public are not allowed to speak at any Council meeting although sometimes the Chairman of the meeting will allow it, but it's not an automatic right. As for incorrect figures being minuted the only way in which this can be altered is for you to contact your local Councillor and ask for them to have the Minutes amended at the next meeting. The Chairman can speak to any Councillor prior or during the meeting, that is quite legal. Unfortunately from what you say I can see no misconduct , but if you are not happy with the behaviour of a Councillor then you can complain to The Standards Board for England, but you must have a valid reason for your complaint. A petition in Law only counts as one objection, therefore it is always better to write individual letters rather than a petition.|`|AWSmknxLaa	In most cases public input at the meeting is not allowed.<br>  <br>  They publish an agenda before hand and you are to submit comment.<br>  <br>  This is no different that any law making group.

I agree.|`|vQxStqR2aa	lol he was just younger & against war & the defense of this great country.|`|fa0KZ6bMaa	He was elected by the ignorant who think he is their Messiah.<br>  <br>  Obama can't fulfill his self-appointed role as Savior unless he has victims to save. The more victims he can create, and the more dire their situation, the more glorious will be the salvation he brings to mankind.  The sicker Obama can make the patient (America), the greater his own perceived benevolence for "healing" it. <br>  <br>  The long term goal is to bring down the market-based economic system (capitalism) he so clearly despises. Even though America has created the most prosperous society for the most people in history, it doesn't meet The One's vision of social justice. At this stage, Obama is busy stripping the private sector of its resources and transferring them to the central authority in order to fund the most massive government spending orgy in history. <br>  <br>  Naturally, this is tanking the stock market, which is also a deliberate tactic. Millions of Americans have their wealth invested in the market, and so far $2.4 trillion of private wealth has been destroyed. If Obama can destroy your private savings, then your sense of financial security is gone. The comfortable retirement you have saved for is gone. You will need someone to save you, where you didn't before. <br>  <br>  But Obama is just getting warmed up. If you thinks it's bad now, wait until cap-and-trade kicks in. This is a tax designed to punish using energy, the lifeblood of a healthy economy. Wait until unions take away the right to a secret ballot. The unions will spread their Detroit-style malaise across the land, and their dues will flow directly to Democrat politicians. Wait until taxes are raised on the job-creating entrepreneur class, the people Obama calls "the rich". <br>  <br>  America is going to get a lot sicker, and it's all part of the plan.|`|uxu8qJUYaa	His only plan was "Change we can believe in" and watching Bob the Builder.

His so called plan is simply to turn the US into a backward country that has the American public trying to suckle off the teet of the government .

Yet in spite of the fact that nothing even close to this has happened in Bush's Presidency he still blames Bush. He needs to take the training wheels off and realize he's the President now. He is a know nothing politician that cheated his way into politics and stole his way into the Senate to begin with.

He is not even prepared to run an outhouse, let alone the White House ! Who in their right mind gives a head of state, on a state visit, a box of out dated CD's ? Only a clown who is in way over his head . Obama never had a plan that could help this Country. What he had were lies and campaign promises to buy him enough votes from issue ignorant voters to put his scheming *** in office.  He wants to "talk" to the Taliban. He wants to tell the enemy when we are leaving Iraq. What a fool. He has not even the most rudimentary grasp of military tactics. We need to rise up and banish ALL democrats from power before they destroy our great Country. Obama is a clown and should be working for Ringling Brothers instead of the American people.
iZEHA854aa	I would review our trade agreements, and evaluate whether other countries are giving our country free access to their markets. If not, anything from their country, whether by direct import, or through a second country import, would have a tariff applied to it. The more their market is closed (an imbalance against our open market) the higher the tariff on their products.<br>  I would finance education for those wanting to go to college, and who maintain a GPA at or above a 2.85<br>  I would then require all who take that educational opportunity to repay the cost through volunteer activities in their communities. Organizations would keep a record of time given, and the cost of their education would be reduced. A buy-out clause would also be available.<br>  I think we should encourage volunteer services as much as possible.<br>  Lastly, I would review military and other government expenses and look for abuse. There seems to be too much money being spent on things in the military that is too high, and special benefits for our federal employees (which I consider Senators, and Congressmen to be) is unfair. I remember hearing these words a lot when I worked for a military supply company, "Good enough for government work."

All illegal aliens would be immediately deported.  Any employer who hired illegal aliens would be fined $500 per person per day.<br>  <br>  I would legalize most recreational drugs.  Too much tax money is being spent on a losing battle. <br>  <br>  Except for some tightening of the borders these proposals would take an act of congress.

They usually stick with cars like older Honda accords/civics, Toyota camry's, etc.. because of their lack of alarms (or a high end alarms), ease of hot wiring, and their parts still fetch a decent price to the highest bidder.|`|p6XPhIxnaa	I know Hondas were once the most popular car for theft.

73f37851c35d22949c704d293473d5cbaa	Against.  I supported capital punishment for a long time, but the more I learned about it, the more I came to oppose it.  In the end, several factors changed my mind:<br>  <br>  1. By far the most compelling is this: Sometimes the legal system gets it wrong. In the last 35 years in the U.S., 130 people have been released from death row because they were exonerated by DNA evidence. These are ALL people who were found guilty “beyond a reasonable doubt.”  Unfortunately, DNA evidence is not available in most cases.  So, as long as the death penalty is in place, you are pretty much GUARANTEED to occasionally execute an innocent person.<br>  <br>  Really, that should be reason enough for most people to oppose it. If you need more, read on:<br>  <br>  2. Cost: Because of higher pre-trial expenses, longer trials, jury sequestration, extra expenses associated with prosecuting & defending a DP case, and the appeals process (which is necessary - see reason #1), it costs taxpayers MUCH more to execute prisoners than to imprison them for life.<br>  <br>  3. The deterrent effect is questionable at best. Violent crime rates are actually HIGHER in death penalty jurisdictions. This may seem counterintuitive, and there are many theories about why this is (Ted Bundy saw it as a challenge, so he chose Florida – the most active execution state at the time – to carry out his final murder spree).  It is probably due, at least in part, to the high cost (see #2), which drains resources from police departments, drug treatment programs, education, and other government services that help prevent crime.  Personally, I think it also has to do with the hypocrisy of taking a stand against murder…by killing people. The government fosters a culture of violence by saying, ‘do as I say, not as I do.’<br>  <br>  4. There’s also an argument to be made that death is too good for the worst criminals. Let them wake up and go to bed every day of their lives in a prison cell, and think about the freedom they DON’T have, until they rot of old age. When Ted Bundy was finally arrested in 1978, he told the police officer, “I wish you had killed me.”  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed (the architect of the 9/11 attacks) would love nothing better than to be put to death.  In his words, "I have been looking to be a martyr [for a] long time."<br>  <br>  5. Most governments are supposed to be secular, but for those who invoke Christian law in this debate, you can find arguments both for AND against the death penalty in the Bible.  The New Testament (starring Jesus) is primarily ANTI-death penalty.  For example, in the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus praises mercy (Matthew 5:7) and rejects “an eye for an eye” (Matthew 5:38-39).  James 4:12 says that GOD is the only one who can take a life in the name of justice.  In John 8:7, Jesus himself says, "let he who is without sin cast the first stone."<br>  <br>  Good luck in your debate!|`|vUe4N5Y7aa	I'm against it.  Too many wrongful convictions.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ryerson.ca/soc705/wrongcon/sld001.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ryerson.ca/soc705/wrongcon/sl...</a>|`|EMmGFqgJaa	A lot of people say capital punishment saves money because you are ending their lives compared to keeping them in jail for the rest of there life. This is a common myth. Here is some financial figures on that <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-death-penalty" rel="nofollow">http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/costs-de...</a><br>  <br>  Once someone is put on death row they immediately get court appeals and lawyers fees are tremendous. Also in recent news the State of Kansas is trying to reduce the amount of people who are on death row to life in imprisonment to save money. If someone is put on death row they don't get executed in a year or two usually it can be 5 years or 10 years because of the lengthy court process for appeals. <br>  <br>  Capital punishment doesn't prevent anything. It does not prevent murder since most murders are a spur of the moment thing like a robbery gone bad or a crime of passion. <br>  <br>  It is also not fairly given out. If you are black you will get the death penalty more often than when you are white. Same thing for male over female. If you have money to higher a good attorney you will get life in prison over the death penalty. <br>  <br>  Some people also say that if a rapist/murder has life in prison that they may escape or have a chance for parole. Often people get sentenced to life in prison without a possibility of parole. <br>  <br>  The biggest thing is that the US is the only industrialized country that has capital punishment. All the other 1st world countries do not have the death penalty, they have life in prison. <br>  <br>  When it comes down to it Capital punishment is a revenge thing. Some people say that the bible has the "eye for an eye" thing. But doesn't the bible also have the "Thou shall not kill" and doesn't the Thou shall not kill override the eye for an eye thing.|`|o8xvzhuhaa	Capital Punishment, reasons why I believe it should be outlawed.<br>  -Should anyone be allowed to judge whether a person lives or dies?<br>  -Capital Punishment has killed people who were innocent<br>  -It doesn't solve any problems<br>  -It's cruel and/or unusual punishment<br>  -The US is one of the few countries that still has capital punishment|`|78z7gk7naa	1.) More room for jails, which is already overcrowded already.<br>  2.) Tax payers money get spent keeping murderers/rapists alive. <br>  3.) Less Criminals in the world.<br>  4.)

EDumvVTcaa	building on Chasgow's answer . . .<br>  <br>  There's always room in the Reserves.  Your confusion might be over billets (you called them spots).  If there's no open billets in your rate (BM, MK, MST, YN, GM, FS, HS, etc.) at your intended Reserve unit, you cannot join that unit unless somehow they create a space for you via over-billeting.  For example, if you're an MST and do environmental stuff, you cannot be assigned to a small boat search and rescue station.  SAR stations are mostly BM, MK, and sometimes FS, YN, GM and SK.  The other way you could be prevented from joining a Reserve unit is if all the billets available for your rate (for example DC) are filled at your intended unit, you'd have to look for another Reserve unit to join.<br>  <br>  Trying to find a station/unit while serving active duty works the same way as the reserves.  Otherwise, 80% of the USCG would be serving in Key West, FL; Honolulu, HI or San Diego, CA and the SAR stations like Mackinaw, MI would have just 1 guy waiting to attend his "A" school.|`|NlksZPfTaa	When you join the Coast Guard, there is really no such thing as reserves. Once basic training is over which is 8 weeks long, you're in the Coast Guard as active. Like other branches, you serve 4 years active as to contract terms. To be a reserve, it depends on your job too; Usually, reserves are for people whose done four years active and choose to work somewhere else.|`|mzk0t6Ovaa	M.D. is pretty much clueless. . .

I've been on active duty<br>  since February 1979, and we've had a Reserve 40 years longer than<br>  that.  <br>  <br>  You can either enlist as a Reserve, or you can do your active duty<br>  time then transfer to the IRR (basically just get out and spend the<br>  rest of your military obligation in a non-drilling Reserve status) or <br>  affiliate with the Selected (i.e., "drilling") Reserve.<br>  <br>  Congrats on singing on.

The contradiction between their statements about the Bush and Obama Presidencies are just laughable. Congress stopped mattering when the Democrats took over in 2006. Then the Presidency stopped mattering in 2008. To hear them tell it the Democrats have no power at all and therefore are responsible for nothing past or present. I have given up on reasonable examination of issues by most Democrats and am just content to comment on what I see and wait for the inevitable collapse which will be precipitated by their overspending and use of crises to fund every extreme plan they have ever dreamed of.

m0dntUuwaa	Well I believe that California has the 3 strikes law, where no matter how minor or serious the 3rd offense is, if they are convicted they are in prison for life. Some other states have adopted this too, but there are so many things to consider when contemplating a law like that. The prisons are already overcrowed for one, and two, I know a lot of people(like me) are not too fond of having to inadvertingly pay to keep these guys in prison(i.e. taxes). There are more prisons than universities in California, so it's a lot to consider. That would get all the scum off the street, but where would we put them? That means more tax money gets put into building another prison to house these busters. It's a lot to think about.|`|hRLZnGabaa	can you imagine the cost of money to house criminals for the rest of their lives , can you imagine how our families would disintegrate to an even lower number of functioning adults with such an absurd thought as to use prison as a source of controlling violence.<br>  <br>  violence takes place when people lose hope for a decent future, surely we must offer our youth some encouragement and not more despair.<br>  taxing people more for having children they can't seem to care for would be a better idea.  similar to china's government today.<br>  cause when i child feels unwanted/unloved they act out , that's the circle, they keep re-offending because they aren't given a better option or they can't seem to comprehend that life has some hope if they learn to work towards it.<br>  welfare program ruined households and then crack/crank/meth/drugs in general are now ruining entire cities/states, gee,  even legal drugs are screwing up our society daily.<br>  <br>  lets all be part of the solution and not just use condemnation as a guide cause that sure wont help anyone.<br>  <br>  in japan, most citizens follow rules because their schools are very strict and their parenting use to be strict but it's becoming much more wishy washy and their teens are acting out and not as cute as you might like to believe|`|AA11790156	we should be much harder on criminals a lot of jails have people living better than hard working class people|`|Ef9zLkOTaa	Fine by me|`|56383c92c8bbc510079c94b1baf7d3d9aa	I think that the prison system and court sentencing in the US is too lenient. Our government has set forth laws for us citizens to abide by, no matter if we like or agree with them. Lets look at theft. Some kid stealing some gum from a convenience store is hopefully not the same as some CEO stealing millions of dollars from the company and its investors. But the fact is, they both stole. Should the punishment be the same for both. I think so. I also think we should get rid of death row and replace it with death cell. And that cell should never be occupied. Once a person is convicted beyond a shadow of a doubt, spend the fifty cents on a bullet and shoot them right then. Hell take them to times square and televise it. You do the crime, this is what you get. Of course there will be some that are actually innocent, but I would gladly lose a few innocents then let guilties go on living on my tax dollar. Some may not like what I am say, so be it. You have the right to your opinion. Something that is allowed to you by the men and women who have fought for our freedoms in this country that the criminals take away.|`|MOALBorJaa	I believe in Japan private individuals cannot own a handgun. I also believe they strive for full employment of their citizens. Perhaps instead of immediately seeking punitive measures to deter crime, it would be helpful to look at the conditions that encourage crime to begin with. However, life imprisonment for second offenders may be useful. Let's start with those convicted of driving under the influence.|`|pyHF4eYJaa	Absolutely not. A lot of the crimes people are being arrested for are drug related, not violence related. We don't what that kind of system for a number of reasons. What happens if you or anyone else answering some day has to turn to crime due to economic conditions. Do you think it would be fair to be locked away for life for minor offenses?|`|yCcLnI1Gaa	I agree, prison in the U.S. must be a lot of fun, since people seem to want to go back as often as possible (I know they hook up alot in prison, maybe that's the attraction).
N93Ax4Wnaa	So "China harassing US navy ship" became the official U.S. version of story?<br>  <br>  How about this one?<br>  ****<br>  A U.S. navy ship got as close as a few miles off Chinese coast and tried to scan China's submarine activity in order to locate some underwater submarine bases.<br>  <br>  Five Chinese ships went to intercept after repeatedly warning of leave with no result.<br>  ***<br>  <br>  <br>  As simple as that, the U.S. ship had no business there other than harassing China.   And China responded, it's China's fault?<br>  <br>  Same sh1t happened with that spy plane.   It could record all military communications across half of China from that location...and it was indeed doing that.   "13 miles offshore = international water" = bull sh1t made up by the U.S.  and its NATO puppies.<br>  As the matter of fact, the U.S. ships and planes play "we are in international water" on daily basis while were actually right on the edge of that line and harassing China for decades already!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  What if I always stand on the sidewalk outside your window, and try to peek around and listen to your family's conversation all day long for years.   Oh yeah, I was standing on the sidewalk which is public space.   If you get annoyed and come out to tell me to leave, so I could sue you for "house owner harassed me!"

The Chinese send submarines into Japanese territorial waters.  They know they certainly have no right to complain about American ships in international waters.  They are only testing the resolve of foreign governments, and so far we're all failing.

x3D2BUMEaa	I went to China in August for the Olympics and to visit relatives in Shanghai (my mother was born in China.)  Compared to 25 years or so ago when my mother left China, it is much more democratic.  It has been an obviously slow and painful process, but the government actually does sometimes react to the pressure put upon it by the citizens (it is done thru the Communist Party structure.)  As time goes on and economic freedom continues to assert itself in China, the government will find that it is less and less able to control the huge populace thru totalitarian means.  China is slowly becoming more democratic.  The engine of that change is information (the net) and education.  The transformation of Chinese society will only accelerate as the citizenry becomes more and more aware of the freedoms available to the citizens of other nations in the world.  Here is something to ponder:  the average Chinese citizen thinks extremely highly of the United States!|`|J74Y5LKxaa	This is real simple......take some time to investigate why HONG KONG is still just as capitalist as it ever was, despite being handed back over to the Chinese by the British 10 years ago.

On the contrary, it is the transition from the international financial turmoil and credit crunch to recession or depression that exacerbate all accumulated contradictions in the Chinese economy and society with incalculable world implications.<br>  <br>         Chinese growth is export-led. It cannot trigger resurgences elsewhere; as global growth slows, demand for Chinese goods will tend to stagnate or fall. The main outlet of Chinese exports is the US consumer and now it is collapsing for the first time in two decades<br>  <br>         Already the growth rate is revised downwards from 11% to 9% or 7%, or even lower for 2009. Output cuts in aluminum and nickel production are announced after the escalation of the world crisis. The People's Bank of China predicted on October 31st that in the coming two years housing prices would slide by 10 to 30% marking the bursting of the real estate bubble; even more important the Bank revealed its worries about a liquidity crunch affecting severely not only real estate companies but also the commercial banks that have devoted from 20% to 40% of their total loans to the real estate sector. Cuts in the banking interest rates are also an indication of a rather rapid cooling of the Chinese growth rate under the new world conditions. Western analysts like N. Roubini predict the high possibility of a hard landing of the Chinese economy next year.<br>  <br>        The Chinese growth, which made it in the previous years "the workshop of the world", is based on the cannibalization of the sectors where the Chinese revolution had expropriated capital (State enterprises, state banking system) to propel an economy led by exports in the world market, not local demand or profit in the domestic market. Strong capitalist development is driven forward on non-capitalist premises (for ex. loans are provided by the State banks without capitalist criteria), and, at the last instance, on over-exploitation of a cheap and vast labor force, disciplined under a Stalinist regime, on behalf of global capital. <br>  <br>           Social inequalities between the industrial coastal zones open to the world market and the rural inlands, feed unstoppable waves of inner migration to the cities, rural unrest and continuous peasant rebellions, workers' wild strikes. <br>  <br>         China needs a growth rate of 9-10% to absorb every year about 24 million people joining the labor force, and 12-14 million poor rural farmers moving to the industrial urban sector. Any lowering of the growth rate below this mark adds millions of new unemployed and more explosive material for coming upheavals. In a hard landing of the Chinese economy from 12% down to the critical level of 6% (quite possible in the current conditions of the world crisis) amounts to a death blow to any legitimacy, and stability of the CPC bureaucratic restorationist regime.<br>  <br>         The CPC leadership is split by a kind of double bound: either they try to keep a high growth rate by concentrating their efforts to the coastal zones and facing all the consequences abroad of the contraction in the US and world market and at home of the disintegration of the inner agrarian heartland; or they cut their links to the world market and turn inwards to build an internal (capitalist) market. Both processes cannot but exacerbate the contradictions to the point of explosion.

FUL3Ez2Iaa	In reality, you do not need the 25% unemployment rate if other factors are in place:  In economics, a depression is a sustained, long downturn in one or more economies. It is more severe than a recession, which is seen as a normal downturn in the business cycle.  Considered a rare but extreme form of recession, a depression is characterized by abnormal increases in unemployment, restriction of credit, shrinking output and investment, numerous bankruptcies, reduced amounts of trade and commerce, as well as highly volatile relative currency value fluctuations, mostly devaluations. Price deflation or hyperinflation are also common elements of a depression.  We have it all, just not the 25% unemployment (yet) so yes, I would say that we are in a depression.|`|Cn1tSHLpaa	Nope...you need 25%+ unemployment to be in a "Depression"...we have quite a way to go.  (Then again, intelligence is not a Republican's strong-suit so you probably wouldn't know that unless St. Rush Limbaugh, the Patron Saint of Liars and the Ignorant, told you...)|`|RCqG4z5Oaa	Yes we are in a depression.

F2sUPNF2aa	The number of promotion points needed to get promoted changes every month. It just depends upon how many soldiers (at whichever applicable rank) are needed for the upcoming month. One month points may be maxed out at 799 and the next it could drop to 500 or lower. That's why you need to get as many points as you can so you don't have to wait until the plummet. It has nothing whatsoever to do with it being a critical MOS or not. <br>  <br>  Check around mid month and the newest promotion points will be released for the upcoming month.|`|n2oEhdZiaa	Sounds like retention kicked in and more experienced people are staying in, creating fewer vacancies.

AA10829482	Hi Ellie<br>  <br>  Sounds like your husband took out the Survivor Benefit Plan when he retired and named his ex the beneficiary. . . .depending on how long he was married; he may not be able to change it.  It means that she will get a portion of his retirement pay when he dies.  My mom gets 50% of my late father's retirement under this plan.  <br>  <br>  It does not make her the beneficiary of his will or any civilian life insurance unless he designated that.   You don't mention if the kids are minors, etc which can be a factor.  <br>  <br>  Please have a chat with your husband about what should/will happen when the unthinkable happens.  Does he want to be an organ donor?  Buried next to you?  Cremated?   When my dad passed, we didn't have a formal plan but we knew what he wanted done and were able to do it.|`|AA10925759	What you need to look at first is if you qualify for a military ID. You are married so you are. If he is retired you will get it. All it will take is him submiting the proper paperwork. <br>  <br>  That ID means all. <br>  <br>  You have to take of that part first.|`|530e3f8d6a946003d76d09039006b8e2aa	If he is your husband and you have a legal marriage, then I would say that YOU decide what happens with his body.|`|4VzVfKvdaa	Snorkle has it mostly right, but I misunderstanding something here. if you mean beneficiary as in insurance policies, that is something between you and your husband.  However, if you are referring to Survivor Benefit Plan (SBP), that depends on how long your husband was married to his first wife. you husband can do nothing about the SBP.  Only his ex wife can decide to accept or not accept it....sorry federal law.  It is NOT the same as civilian. Even his will cannot change that.  Now anything else in his will such as property, insurance, etc...is all up to him.  His other military benefits stop at the time of death. What you do with his body is up to you.|`|84pz6eIVaa	This is something you have to work out with your husband. Go over the details with him and make sure you both agree. If his kids are grown, he needs to take the ex-wife out of the will and put the kids only, or you as beneficiary. If the kids are not grown yet, leave the ex-wife (and kids) as beneficiary. But you and him need to sit down and work it out.|`|b326b96181c4a84b24f503115e014b7daa	First thing, stop worrying about people being "rude" YA will see that...and be rude ANYWAY. <br>  <br>  Second, yes. Upon your husbands death, the beneficiary will be charged with taking care of his body, funeral and any unpaid expenses. <br>  <br>  My next question, why are you not the sole benificary??|`|WtmwGEQcaa	I would have a face to face with my husband and find out what his wishes are. Some of us may wish to be buried beside our mother or father or other guardian.|`|0JL3Mg78aa	If your husband were to pass away, you could bury him wherever you and/or he wanted.  He might qualify for a military burial, but about that I am not sure.  You should want to be buried with him, I would imagine?  Or if cremated, together in a mausoleum?  You should speak to him about it and make written plans (also a living will) so there are no misunderstandings later. <br>  <br>  If the ex-wife was married for a certain number of years, she is entitled to half his military pension--that should be in the divorce decree.|`|a8nlx2oRaa	Your husband can change the beneficiary if he chooses.  It may be that he feels his ex is entitled to the benefits. <br>  <br>  You do not send the body back. Just tell the Funeral Home that he is a Vet and you want them to arrange a Military Funeral. They will take care of everything.  If you want to find out more, go to the nearest military installation and go to the Mortuary Affairs Division.<br>  <br>  If you want to research it online go to a search engine and search for "Former Military Spouse" "Survivor Benefit Plan" "Military Spouse" "Military Death Benefits"   I was going to attach a few links, but there are so many I would not know where to start.  There are also places (found on-line) that you can get information packs sent to you.<br>  <br>  As the wife of a retired Military member you have certain benefits also.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|qLkknQx1aa	i'm not trying to be rude, honestly i'm not, but you need to be talking to your husband about this not strangers on yahoo answers. - there is something else going on and if you don't demand answers from your husband your butt is gonna be left out in cold. - you won't find the answers that you are looking for by asking people who are not in your shoes. - if i found out my husband was leaving it to his ex, he would officially be MY ex. - sorry. hope it works out for you.|`|ABmZYbDZaa	Not being rude but you need to find out what he wants you to do. Her being his beneficiary really has nothing to do with who buries him unless that money is tied into each other somehow. If that is the case then he needs to specify in his will who is supposed to take care of what or better yet plan it, pay for it and have it all laid out ahead of time to avoid conflict at an already sensitive time.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	Have him make out a document specifying how he wants his remains to be treated.  I am not anything like a lawyer but if he should die before you while you are still married his remains will be your property.<br>  <br>  His Veterans benefits are supposed to be enough to cover the basic military burial.
b326b96181c4a84b24f503115e014b7daa	Kudos on going into basic as an e-3. Civilan education is a great thing to have in the military. Please ignore those who think you "cheapen" the rank, you don't. I came in an e-3..<br>  <br>  Now, onto pay. <br>  You will get base pay. You should look up the military pay chart. It went up, so I am not sure what it is for an e-3 anymore. It should be about 1600 base pay. <br>  <br>  Now, (please keep in mine that i am Army) You won't get paid for 1 1/2 months, but when you do get paid, you will get the previous 1 1/2 months pay (it takes time to catch up, you get paid the day you swear in and go to the base you start basic training) <br>  <br>  For deductions. In Army basic, they give you a "credit" card pre-loaded with 250 (for males) 300 (for females) to buy things that you need at the small "basic px/bx" (females is higher because we need more) That money IS taken out later. Initial issue takes about 500 out. <br>  <br>  Now, my first paycheck in basic, was 4k. So, you don't lose out on money.

It was Bush and his economic advisers dropping interest rates and allowing wall street to take over the mortgage industry with no regulations that caused this economic disaster. Recessions are normal, this is not, and had absolutely nothing to do with Clinton. And Obama? Everybody (except you it seems) knew that as Obama told all of us (including you) that "things will get worse before they get better". This is because this is bigger then Government at this point. And if Obama has screwed anything up yet, it takes more than 6 weeks for it to screw up the country. Your an idiot.<br>  <br>  P.S. Fox news is owned by republicans. Watch MSNBC or CNBC if you want a full view of what is happening out there. If the republicans do take back congress it will be because there are that many idiots out there who will put the blame of this recesion on Obama when it is a known fact to any educated person that this will take many years to fix no matter who is in power.

9dEotvVwaa	I don't listen to anything Barry says because it just pisses me off.  As for stocks I am investing as much as ever right now hoping one day that we kick that dip shi* out of office and get a pro business president in.  Then I will rake in the cash.<br>  <br>  As for the boat. I wouldn't step in the same patch of grass where he stepped, and if I did by accident, I would clean my shoe just as I would if I were to step in dog crap.|`|EPObVPzVaa	When your boat is sinking, it does no good to bail water if you haven't plugged the leak.<br>  <br>  He is STILL encouraging, even demanding that banks continue to make loans.<br>  <br>  They ARE making loans.  RESPONSIBLE loans.<br>  Sooooo, what does he want?  More loans to people who can't pay?<br>  <br>  He's making the hole bigger.|`|4efdc5368b23398e691a290a96c0937baa	No and he is probably a better boat builder than an economist|`|u23sBafTaa	No way !  It would have to holes in the bottom and he would just keep yelling bail ! Bail ! Bail! Bail !|`|74dfcb1be61ec91aea7144815438e380aa	I was unaware that he was a boatwright as well as a well educated lawyer and statesman.<br>  As I was told long ago by investors, you only realize a gain or loss when you sell. Buying low is the way to go, just because they haven't hit rock bottom doesn't mean that now isn't the time to invest. the market won't be the same 1 or 2 years from now and if people start putting money in the market it will help stabilize it.. However, it doesn't appear that you're looking for sound advice, it looks more like you want to panic pointlessly and churn up fear in those around you therefore I'd say you're on the right track.|`|Pxs60mVdaa	Yes I would, reminds me of another guy who built a boat and every one laughed at him as well.<br>  If you haven't been watching the market then that is your problem. I have been buying stocks, stocks that are very close to bottoming out. Harley Davidson stock is one of these. It's called long term investing.

I've sailed in boats when I had absolutely no idea who was responsible for designing and building them.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm not in a position to be investing my money in stocks right now, so that particular advice of his is meaningless to me.
Cl2VHwVQaa	To the person talking about the slums of Chicago, Maryville is nowhere near Chicago, it is in southern Illinois, east of St. Louis.  It is a peaceful small town, where something like this is kind of shocking.  I happen to live two towns over and also attend a First Baptist church, so it makes one think about how something like this can happen anywhere at anytime, and I can only imagine that acts of hatred like this will only escalate in the times we are living in.  Human life is no longer valued, as Barack Obama made apparent today.<br>  <br>  By the way, the guy also had a knife, and two people got injured by the knife.  Perhaps he should have had a background check to be able to buy that knife.<br>  <br>  People that talk about gun control are so naive.  Who do you think is going to own guns, once you get guns outlawed?  Only criminals will have them.|`|PhTQn6ycaa	Seeing as you have already condemned me as a godless heathen, I'll run with it, but remember I wasn't the godless heathen who shot the man, That was a church goer.

I do however pray for the family of the deceased, regardless of who they are.|`|m24wuDzwaa	Apparently you don't realize that most liberals disapprove of violence. Also most of us also believe in god, we just don't seek to impose our beliefs onto others like those on the religious right.|`|QSAPw7AOaa	Unfortunate.|`|wNVkQk8Faa	That's what happens in slums like Chicago,  soon it's martial law there|`|I6dcRgD6aa	Your question shows the ignorance of people like you. I grew up around people like you, I call you the Jerry Springer type of people. I worked hard to get away & now have a great life. I have hundreds of people who are probably liberals that attend the same church I attend. We don't talk about religion to others normally. We are not told to go out & spread the work but to trust that we are all exactly where we are meant to be in life. So our church is not worried about money yet it always comes in the right amount. I do not want to comment on the man who made his transition on Sunday. I trust he safe & pray his family is in peace & know they are surrounded by love & they probably have already forgiven the man who committed this crime.|`|u23sBafTaa	The incident was near St. Louis, the young man has had lyme disease for many years.  They think that it had affected his mental capacity, he has several incidents of rather odd behavior according to neighbors, it is sad no what part you belong to I doubt he belonged to either in his condition.  No one should make fun or accuse anyone of thinking it is okay.  He is sick and the thing was just very sad for everyone involved|`|cMHxg372aa	It's a miracle!<br>  <br>  Oh, uh...

cMHxg372aa	Because they are committed to a radical fascist agenda - the systematic destruction of real economies and productive enterprises through financial speculation, war and armaments spending, and fiscal austerity. A new form of feudalism on a global scale, in other words.<br>  <br>  So, the answer is that they fear the Democrats' policies might benefit real people and enhance our economic productivity. Both of those things stand innately opposed to their ideology of power for the sake of power.|`|96e391ed38447964faf042cf980c1571aa	The majority of Republicans were against the first bailout.  The majority of Republicans were opposed to the second bailout.  Considering the scope of Obama's stimulus plan, it looks like the Republicans were fiscally responsible since Obama is going to spend more in one month than Bush did in 8 years.|`|ipWRgKetaa	Well, you see, this is one of the reasons that John McCain wasn't elected. We, those of us who are conservative, recognized that there was little difference between him and your basic big government, free spending democrat. Remember when he said, during a debate, that he'd renegotiate home mortgages at their current value, essentially forgiving the loss? Our mouths dropped open in amazement. So, you have a point. But what does it say when even these free spending, big government legislators are shocked and stunned by Barry's obscene and reckless spending? THAT is what you should be noticing. THAT is the big tell. They're sitting back thinking, "Holy crap!! I know we spent like a pack of drunken sailors, but...well, holy crap!!" <br>  <br>  So I hope that helps. <br>  <br>  Lastly, however, does past irresponsibility justify continued irresponsibility? I thought Barry was all about change. Guess I was wrong.|`|5d9pCmjyaa	It's called politics - and they have to do something to oppose the Democrats, right?<br>  <br>  I mean, 40% of the very earmarks they are whining about are for fellow Republicans.  But they still have to bellyache or people will think they're not doing their jobs.|`|8Zpmm22raa	No,,,,it was DEMOCRATS that passed the first Bush Bailout bill. <br>  While the majority of Republicans opposed it.<br>  <br>  According to voting results, 172 Democrats voted in favor of the bill while 62 opposed it; and 91 Republicans voted for it and 108 voted against it.<br>  <br>  And it was DEMOCRATS that passed the Obama package too.|`|XEcoJnt4aa	The Rushpublicans are of the mind that they do no wrong. you and I know that, but they cannot seem to grasp that there are other ways of thinking. These ways take care of all the folks in our country, not the "chosen few". Have a nice day.|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	Reagan did the same thing.

You have to admit that Obama sure does know how to treat those foreign dignitaries.  It just shows you that he has no clue concerning common ordinary decorum and neither does his staff.  We just insulted two nations in one week, England and Russia.  Absolutely amazing and the Obamakins had the nerve to call George W.

You could very well be locked up for a while.|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Hopefully so.|`|DJo0E2I2aa	find the law saying that tint was legal, dont know about the registration, but you did also double the speed limit, not good, if it's your first offence, you might get away with a HUGE fine|`|AA10950677	I certainly hope you will., but I doubt it.  You'll be standing in front of a judge and will be fined.  They may even suspend you license if you have priors.  Trying to catch up to your friend is no excuse for you to 100 in a 55 zone.  Guess you don't have a cell phone, Huh?|`|FfPUhCuiaa	Reckless Driving- Reckless endangerment-  I think you will probably lose your license- you were close to double the speed limit.  I don't think the tint or the card will hurt you much.

YOU own the car now and so therefor you are responsible.<br>  <br>  You could lose your license, your insurance is going to triple in price if you can find somebody to insure you.|`|RVlkauBRaa	Im not sure.. I know that in Canada if your going 50 over the speed limit they tow your car right off the road and take your licence for a bit :p<br>  <br>  so if your heading to Canada.. Go the speed limit|`|HZIi4DPfaa	omg so funny!! im really sorry but i live in pa and know  what you mean. The first reason i think this is funny. is cause my husband had 30 on are camero and he got stopped for it in highspire , they gave him a warning. you can't really fight it. because only the back 2 windows are aloud to have tint and the rear window. the front 3 windows are not aloud to have tint. 2 sides and duh the front one. They tell you 30% but they don't tell you that it's illegal to have the 2 front sides done. so if you have a car like the camero that only have 2 front windows your pretty much screwed and have to take it off. we did. they gave us a week. everyone races and it's really fun. I don't think you will lose your license... if you did not get a fine when they had you there they can't send you a fine in the mail. I don't really think you have to worry except for them telling you to sign your card and get the tint off within a certain time and you have to show them that you took it off. <br>  good luck <br>  try not to speed even though its the greatest rush ever.<br>  <br>  Edit: i got pulled over for an unregistered license plate in harrisburg pa after coming from ohio . he couldn't do anything cause i had 72 hours to get it registered. but he tried to get me for other **** though. There all assholes and try to get you for something if they can't with what they have in front of them. My husband just got his license back after not having them for a long time. due to speeding and driving with no license.

The penalties are up to the judge.  He can sentence you to up to 1 year in jail (rarely happens), and/or up to 1,000.00 dollars in fines (normally in the area of 200.00).

hcc8fq7jaa	Let's be realistic about "presidential vacations", folks. Remember, the left was constantly assailing Bush for taking "too many vacations". The fact is, as president, you don't really get vacations. He's still president, regardless of where he's staying. He can still execute his duties, and doesn't get any real time off. <br>  Why do you think they all end up aging so much?<br>  Bama's getting gray already.<br>  Don't get me wrong, I still think he's a disaster for the US, but the "vacation" argument is lame.|`|533684f214d3fb0932c1e2b8e2a66da4aa	Times were different, Bush didn't have this crisis to deal with.

48acf9585e24591f1ae712f47be9e050aa	The answers claiming that a late fee is OK just because it is in a contract are wrong, since Civil Code section 1671 is a limitation upon what can lawfully be in a contract.  However, the site you reference overstates the case upon which it relies, Orozco v. Casimiro (2004) 121 Cal.App.4th Supp. 7.  <br>  <br>  Late fees in a contract ARE pemissible under the statute in situtions where it would be impractical or extremely difficult to determine the actual amount of damages from the late payment, and the amount specified in the contract is reasonable under the circumstances.  The court found 1) that there was no evidence that the damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to determine, and 2) the evidence suggested that the $50 fee charged in that case was not reasonable.<br>  <br>  Other facts could lead to other conclusions in other cases, particularly if there was evidence concerning the difficulty of determining actual damages (though I would tend to think that a $50 late fee would be unreasonable in almost any case).  Of course, for most people it is not worth the time or money necessary to contest the fee.  (The landlord in Orozco was not trying to get money, he was trying to evict the tenants for not paying the fee, and the tenants were represented by Legal Aid.)  So, most landlords will probably get away with charging a reasonable late fee.|`|xxDjV6Axaa	I don't see where that is going to fly.  This firm is trying to say that liquidating damages doesn't apply in that case and I doubt if they would win.  But I bet they would be happy to take your money and try.|`|0925b6e49a69fe375d1a58ad2c4b8713aa	Real simple, don't pay late and you won't have to worry about whether it is legal or not.<br>  <br>  I read the text and it is obviously written from a tenant's point of view.  Claiming that the landlord should never be granted any additional cost above and beyond the interest on the money the tenant is late is a crock.  Two reasons. First, when a tenant is late, certain actions are then required to determine if the rent will be paid.  Those take time and are paid in the form of higher rents or management fees (passed on in the rent) that the tenant paying on time is being charged for.  Even though they may never be late.  Second, a "reasonable" late fee is the best incentive to encourage proper behavior by the tenant in the first place. <br>  <br>  The late fee then is a good idea, if it has enough value to mean something without being too large a burden, to encourage communication and ultimately payment.  Otherwise, without a late fee to help the person prioritize their bills, the only option left is the one the person wrote about.  Simply wait until the first and if the rent isn't paid, write the 3 day letter and then proceed down that path every month.  That seems wasteful for both parties.|`|jsxphZJEaa	ALl landlords will incorpporate this fee, and again, while this website says it is illegal, you cannot believe all you read on internet. Late fees are enforceable in court of law as a damage in CA.  ANd that is oneway to get around it, they address, damages and late fees are under that catagory|`|bn0axDktaa	Its illegal unless its in your renters agreement, which I garuntee you 100% they put it in there.|`|jAPvUSeEaa	well that was a long time, u might want to double check and i will do that too cuz once my landlord charged me for a late payment fee

He is the only politician that speaks with sense (and fully grasps Economics, History and the like that can boost his understanding of his term in office), supports civil liberties and does not support the political and financial corruptness that is haunting the houses of the American people.<br>  <br>  The reasons used to justify the decision to choose 'mainstream' politicians (e.g. Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, John McCain etc) can be surmised on that of a popularity contest. Such decisions of choosing a politician are not made on the basis of political foresight, but more so on the party they represent.

There are four ways to earn a commission in the Corps. One is the Naval Academy in Annapolis, MD. Another way is to enroll in an NROTC - Marine Option program at a college. You could also do PLC (Platoon Leaders Class) in your first two years of college and then OCC (Officer Candidates Course) in your senior year or if you're already a college graduate. Whatever you choose, just know that afterwards your expected to give I think it is six years of active duty service as an officer in the USMC.|`|AMDs8X0Raa	<a href="http://www.ocs.usmc.mil/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ocs.usmc.mil/</a><br>  <a href="http://marineofficer.com/page/Earning-a-Commission-O.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://marineofficer.com/page/Earning-a-...</a><br>  <br>  Talk to an Officer Recruiter and NOT an enlistment recruiter they will try to steer you into enlisting since they have quotas and get bonus.

POygTyTAaa	I think it's finally a step forward in science.  My sister was totally paralyzed in a car accident 13 years ago.  We have been waiting for this day for many years.  Just the possibly that through stem cell research, we may find a cure for spinal cord injuries as well as many other diseases.  I actually think that not overturning Bush's decision is criminal negligence.  I don't think that there is actually anyone out there that believes that we abort babies for stem cell research. Just think if we had known the possibilities of the umbilical cord 100 yrs ago, how many diseases we could have cured.|`|8ad6fQiNaa	We fund every other type of science out there, so why not fund one that has shown it can help us and lower our healthcare costs in the long run?|`|um87XJvmaa	I think it is a good idea, but only time will tell if it is successful.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	For those who want to ignore the facts.. <br>  the "embryos" are being destroyed anyway. Prohibiting research with them, will NOT CHANGE the laws about abortion. <br>  You have 2 groups, <br>  the scientists who repeatedly have said that the BEST chances for success are from embryonic cells (not alternates)<br>  and the families who realize that this research WILL SAVE LIVES. <br>  <br>  Of ALL THE FUNDING out there. this has the best chance to be of true Christian goals.. to really stop some diseases. And someone actually said, we have more important things to fund. <br>  So. Who should be heard? <br>  Oh.. I am among the second group, my husband has MS.. and he WOULD give his life, if it meant helping someone else in the future.|`|UvCA6ajZaa	Its a great idea. We need to move forward in life.

25Cu0kjFaa	Warrant Officer is a rank, so it all depends on what he plans to do. Warrant Officers tend to be best described as technical or administrative specialists.<br>  <br>  31 is not too old, traditionally Warrant Officers are drawn from the ranks of mid- and senior-level NCOs.<br>  <br>  More details about the WO program at the link.<br>  <br>  It can be a very positive move. Warrant Officers are treated as officers, and God knows they have better post-Army career prospects than straight infantry.|`|WtmwGEQcaa	I was enlisted  for 12 years and decided to go Warrant Officer.  I had to attend a Warrant Officer Academy and go through a tech track before i was pinned. My next 8  years was the best years that i could of had. Just remember: A Warrant Officer is the technician in his field. He is the one that is supposed to have the correct answers. I was E-7 when i decided to go warrant and i never regretted a day of it.|`|0NSax0u9aa	You didn't say what MOS he wants to change too. If you want to know the pros or cons of that MOS|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Well first he will have to see if he can retrain out of infantry <br>  <br>  That will depend on his rank.<br>  <br>  Then he will still need 5 to 6 years of experience in the new MOS, before he can become a Warrant in that mos.<br>  <br>  So age will definately play a factor.
AA10274478	CPS doesn't really pay much attention to mental abuse.

You got one of those for free, right?<br>  <br>  If an inmate wants to get a college degree, they have to pay for that themselves.  Prisons don't teach college courses, and inmates must pay for correspondence courses.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Educational opportunities in jail or prison are severely limited.  The best bet a prisoner has is to use his time to read and study on his own.<br>  <br>  In times past, there were better opportunities for education in prison.  But then there were also better opportunities -out- of prison.|`|7149XmBqaa	The fact that your record makes you not very desirable as an employee would keep most people from trying it.  As well as having to shower with "Butch and his buds," and having your freedom taken away.  The constant noise level is known to drive some people insane.  Besides, the education services that are offered in prison are not college level accredited courses.  They are more like life skills and remedial reading.  Some trades are taught, but again, nothing college level.  They are more interested in improving the lot of somebody who may turn into a career criminal. If he sees another way, he may mend his own.  They are not training brain surgeons and rocket scientists.|`|vUe4N5Y7aa	Prisoners do this mainly to impress upon the members of the parole board that they are trying to turn their lives around with a better education.|`|uW1a0HZcaa	the thought of being raped in a jail cell in the middle of the night would be the first thing to come to mind|`|FKN9kBvLaa	Yeah, because once a CONVICTED FELON has a degree from San Quinton, employers are dying to get a hold of him.  How can we compete? (sarcasm)|`|0JL3Mg78aa	The majority of those in prison do not have a high school diploma--there are mostly GED classes for many prisoners.  There are some high level education and vocational training classes but not enough.  I think you would willingly do whatever you could to pay for an education rather than "go to prison" to get one.  How ridiculous--their education is the equivalent of adult education classes and community college, mostly.|`|b2588303cd0bf17f0993891608852540aa	Well I would think most employers would hire the college educated person versus a convicted felon.

RD5sTZaFaa	If you are attempting to open a private club you probably will have to talk to the county planning commission in order to find out what the law is regarding that type of business.  If you find that the laws are too complicated and you don't want to comply you go to the commission to get them to waive the law with regard to your business. <br>  <br>  The DA is not there to enforce the business laws, or to answer this type of question.  If you don't understand one of the laws you should go to see an attorney to be sure you are complying with it.  It is just part of the cost of starting a business.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|z88IMXNFaa	It's certainly not the DA.  The DA prosecutes criminal matters.

You are to thank Obama whole-heartedly for taking your money and giving it to creepy men who fire rockets from Gaza.|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I think we should.  I think it's important for the US to show it sympathizes with the plight of the Palestinian people.  It will improve our standing in the eyes of Muslim countries.

The mere presence of a [legal] firearm around children is not a crime of any sort.|`|LoSXjaGXaa	It is federally mandated that every gun from a dealer be sold with a lock of some kind, but many states do not require that they be used.<br>  <br>  Here's something to think about, the first time I shot a gun was at the age of 5.  I'm still here, as is everyone who was around at the time.  So long as the adults are not being careless, there is no danger whatsoever.  Also, here's a good point.  If you're cleaning the gun, it can't be loaded.  There's no danger whatsoever while the gun is being cleaned.|`|dda37e592e7a473ae883df834ad9805faa	It is legal, however children should never be around guns without adult supervision.  That being said both my daughters started their education on safe gun handling at about age five by helping me clean my guns.  My father had taught me the same way.  He constantly prompted me to be aware of the direction of the muzzle, keep my finger off the trigger at all times and make sure the weapon was unloaded.  This was a weekly ritual for more than a year for me and I have never forgotten it.<br>  <br>  Both my daughters can handle all sort of firearms and both have shot in competition for several years.  They have no curiosity about firearms as that was satisfied long ago.  They are better than most adults are with firearm and I attribute much of that to starting them off early with safety training.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|zejFr1Ciaa	No law against it but a prudent person would make sure that the children were not allowed to touch the gun without adult supervision.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	-It IS until, you momentarily leave it there- to answer the Phone or use the Bathroom- & one of the Kids gets ahold of it...

We have won. We have inflicted justice upon the man whose country we invaded and eviscerated and caused to break apart.”<br>  <br>  “ Iraq is now swamped with mass murderers, guilty of rape and massacre and throat-slitting and torture in the years since our ‘liberation’ of Iraq . Many of them work for the Iraqi government we are currently supporting, democratically elected, of course. And these war criminals, in some cases, are paid by us, through the ministries we set up under this democratic government. And they will not be tried. Or hanged. That is the extent of our cynicism. And our shame. Have ever justice and hypocrisy been so obscenely joined?” (Robert Fisk, The Independent, Nov. 7, 2006)<br>  <br>  The invasion of 2003 was a war crime; in the subsequent three-and-a-half years, the U.S. occupation was responsible for the deaths of 655,000 Iraqis according to a John Hopkins University study; from 1991 to 2003 the United Nations sanctions imposed under the U.S. pressure claimed the lives of one million Iraqis through malnutrition and disease.<br>  <br>  Refuting Bush’s statement that the trial was “a landmark event in the history of Iraq (and) a milestone in the Iraqi people’s efforts to replace the rule of a tyrant with the rule of law,” which the New York Times described as “overreacting,” Malcolm Smart called the trial an “an opportunity missed” and said it “should have been a major contribution towards establishing justice and the rule of law in Iraq.”<br>  <br>  But it was not! Worse the fallout from the “missed opportunity” could create further obstacles to moving from a one-party-one-leader system into a multi-party western-style democratic one, because the verdict if executed would doom reconciliation efforts and exacerbate the internal Iraqi divide to the point of no return away from a full-fledged civil war to settle it.<br>  <br>  To judge with an obvious overwhelming vengeance the leader of a one-party system that ruled the majority of the non-western world during the cold war era at the hands and from the “liberal” perspective of his enemies and the enemies of the system could not be a fair trial; neither could be to judge him in isolation of the ongoing struggle between what he symbolizes and its antithesis.|`|AA10692836	You left out Iran(Shia) and don't forget the Saudis(Sunni).

As "entertaining" as any of the radio jocks may seem, it would not go very far without facts.  This is one reason why liberal radio is not successful, because they parrot the same thing over and over and have not factual basis, and anything they say is "fact" is spun so far out of context that it can easily be under mind and proven incorrect.|`|AA12370001	I certainly hope that if this goes through and Conservative radio is taken off the air or forced to share programming, that HBO has to have a conservative show on to go along with Bill Mahrer and NPR slices up their programming as well.  <br>  <br>  It has to be fair all the way around.

So far, we have seen a trillion dollar stimulus package and it hasn't done one thing to improve the market.  In fact everytime they do something it tanks.  They have no clue and really don't care.  They just want to make social change which amounts to us becoming a welfare state.  So far the stimulus has created 25 one year long jobs for some cops in Ohio.  Actually, it didn't create the jobs, it just funded already planned jobs for one year so I suppose technically he saved 25 jobs.  Anyway, I'm very optimistic.  I figure at the rate he's moving on job stimulus and market stimulus that there will be another 25 jobs  in about two months and the market will only tank 3000 points in 6 months.  I'm thinking about going out and celebrating the great work being done to stimulate both.  Oh, wait.  I can't do that.  It might appear that I'm living too well and then I'll have to pay more taxes.  Looks like it's just going to be a bologna sandwich and a can of Diet Coke for a celebration.|`|cab63c7629d665e7d2f0151df748fdd5aa	I've not heard that one.  However, it was during Carter's democrat administration that the CRA was enacted and during Clinton's democrat administration that it was reenacted.  This was the primary cause of our current housing problem.<br>  <br>  In terms of how a pres. can affect the stock market.  The stock market has a lot to do with fear and emotion.  When we hear things are going to be okay, we tend to feel safer about investing in stocks and we do - which manifests in the DOW going up.  When we feel fearful about things, it tends to fall.<br>  <br>  So...with Obama running around yelling about how this is the worst economy ever and we better get the hand basket ready 'cuz you know where we're going - it doesn't really inspire confidence.|`|Cl2VHwVQaa	Good Lord, you libs blamed Bush for the stock market, for natural disasters, for terrorists crashing planes into our buildings (when the attacks were planned years in advance) and everything else under the sun.  I don't blame Obama for the stock market.  This is something that has been building for years, ever since mortgage lenders started issuing high risk loans to people who didn't plan and save for the future.  Obama isn't helping matters with his 700 billion spending extravanganza which, in no way, will help out the people who actually need help.|`|mkCjcG5oaa	It's like the worst stupid lying I've ever seen.  It's deliberately ignoring the facts of the situation.  I still haven't seen one answer that addresses the fact that the decline started in 2007, a whole year and a half before Obama took office.

That day the market fell by 400 points. The tech bubble burst and America sank quickly and deeply into a recession.<br>  <br>  When Bush lifted the executive limits on domestic drilling, the bottom fell out of the oil commodities market. The price of crude dropped by 25% within weeks and continued to drop as speculators sought new opportunities. Gasoline prices at the pump continued to fall. Now, not even OPEC has been able to raise the price of oil. (The drop in price had nothing to do with demand or the strength of the dollar. These factors had been putting pressure on the market for months without affect.)<br>  <br>  Obama and his congress pass close to two trillion dollars in new spending, spending money America does not have and so America has to borrow. This weakens the dollar around the world. He threatens to tax businesses, corporations and even small business. His actions show him to be anti business, anti free market, anti prosperity and anti economic growth. He is for the worker, no doubt, but the worker does not create jobs, business do. So in such a hostile environment, business is holding back. They're laying off and waiting to see what else the socialist administration is going to do. Now is not the time to be in business, to be profitable or to expand. Now is the time to hunker down and wait to see how this administration will punish Americans for their success. And you don't think that that affects the market?<br>  <br>  As to your chart, those are interesting statistics. I think if you applied a little 'cause and affect' you would see a different story.

MdrCL60caa	I think lowering it to 18 or 19 is ok. I'm 24 and Canadian and our drinking age is 19 here in Ontario (18 in some other provinces) and I don't really think it makes that much of a difference. The truth of the matter is that people in the US are drinking before they are 21 so why bother restricting it. They should either raise everything to 21 or lower the drinking age.  As for maturity; I know some 30 year olds who are probably not mature enough to handle a night drinking and some 17 year olds that probably could.<br>  <br>  The fact is in countries that have a lower drinking age there is actually less problems as a result because its not a novelty. Nobody is breaking any rules by drinking so the rule breakers don't bother in a lot of cases.|`|AJmCHSwmaa	I'm 25, I'm not really sure if I would support it or not. Part of me says yes b/c if you can serve in the military you should be able to drink . Plus it's really not that big of an age difference.<br>  <br>  Part of me also says no though. I think most people do quite a bit of growing up in those 3 years between 18 and 21 so people tend to be more mature. Also, you have a few more years of driving under your belt before you add alcohol to the equation. <br>  <br>  Back when I was 18 I would have said definately. Today it doesn't beneft me so I guess that part of the equation is out. THat said it does make sense to allow college age kids to drink b/c we all know they are going to do it anyway.|`|IHzv611caa	I am all for it, even though I don't drink. For one thing, like you said, people can do everything else at age 18, so why is drinking alcohol so much worse? Also, countries without drinking ages have less problems with alcohol than those that limit it. It's not seen as a taboo in those countries. So I don't support the 21 year old drinking age.|`|NGz7R9enaa	I agree with you on this. I have always felt that if you are allowed to die for your country, you should be able to do it with full rights. I know that a lot of the young adults are drinking anyways, heck I was drinking when I was 16, and I am now 25. Yes there is a maturity issue, but some 50 year old's aren't too mature and I'd rather them not drink, especially the people that drink and drive.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	No,<br>  We lost several of my classmates before we even graduated high school from drunk driving.  Not worth it just so kids can feel like they're doing something special.  <br>  <br>  I'm 21 now and it's really not that big of a deal.  Nothing that killed me to wait for.|`|44209bed877d82f066bd0e61b8c60fa0aa	Bring back prohibition!|`|ehN7ljjOaa	Hell no. Take it from the ones who drank at that age, HELL! NO!<br>  It would be absolute khaos. Nomsayin?|`|JWNzoksmaa	i would...but unfortunately, i don't believe we "as an American society, teach our youth the responsible way of drinking.  Europe has a drinking age of 16, but they are taught not to abuse alcohol b/c it's not made into such a big deal.  Alcohol is a drink...not a drug to be abused.  Get what i'm saying.  Americans view alcohol as "evil" and the more you regulate the more ppl want to do it and abuse it.  It's just the way humans being are.  <br>  <br>  I'm 30, i would support it....if classes were offered in school about how to drink responsibly.  And learning the about wines and beers is a step.  I use to abuse alcohol until i learned to appreciate fine wines and fine beers.  Now, i drink more responsibly...and i don't drink cheap liquor either.  I think if teenagers were taught to drink more expensive alcohols they wouldn't drink to get drunk...b/c they couldn't afford it.<br>  <br>  We, as Americans, coddle our children way too much.  We try to keep our children perpetually children.....there's a real problem here.  Maybe that's why pedophilia is out of control in our country....b/c we raise our children to stay immature and "forever young".|`|Q2n6nMWUaa	I wouldn't support it.  The part of the brain that functions as the decision-maker isn't fully developed until 20 or 21.  Alcohol abuse and DUI's would increase, I believe.  The only exception I have is the military while on deployment.  They should be allowed one or two beers a day while deployed to Iraq/Afghanistan.  <br>  <br>  I know that older teens would abuse it because I've seen it.  I was stationed on Fort Bliss while the drinking age ON POST was 18.  Guess who had the highest number of alcohol-related incidents?  Yep, 18 - 20 year olds.  And they often got themselves into trouble off-post, too.<br>  <br>  I'm 24, by the way.|`|rBATSpC5aa	I agree with your idea about getting drafted. But more like just joining, there isn't a draft anymore. But I mean, they could still do a zero tolerancy law on driving, like they have now, for people under 21. Really, they should have a zero tolerency law all the time. I wouldn't say that a person who's 18 is more likely to drive drunk than a person who's 35. <br>  <br>  But I think, at least, if you're gonna go to Iraq or something, you should be able to celebrate surviving and enjoy a beer or something when you get home. <br>  <br>  I'm 17, and i think it should be 18. Not just becasue then I could do it soon, but just because I think that law screws people over. I can do basically anything I want when i'm 18, even go die to "defend" our country from Iraq, but I couldn't drink some alcohol?|`|1UTseVvwaa	I would absolutely support it. I'm 16 and I don't even drink, so that's not why I would. I believe that if we can put guns in the hands of 18 year olds and tell them to go kill people overseas, then they can surely enjoy a drink here and there. As a teenager, here is something about us- we find that it is more fun to do things that we're not allowed to do. That being said, there's a possibility that this change could even lower the amount of accidents seen from drunk driving. If we're allowed to do it, we wouldn't have to try to hard to hide it and then get irresponsible.<br>  <br>  Just my insight on it.|`|hdagyZ6Taa	Well u cant get drafted as per the constitution u can join though lol<br>  <br>  anyways im 16 and I'd have to agree with u and at the same time not Sure it would be OK for people who can A) hold there Alchohol<br>  or B) drink responsibly BUT you have to consider the ignorant people casuing accidents and fighting and stuff like that, I think it should remain 21 for safety of general public|`|ZRVxc4haaa	NO. I would not support it. But on the other hand, everyone starts drinking when they are 12 anyways. In this horrible world we live in. Alcohol is bad for you. keep it illegal so at least there is a punishment for being prematurely stupid. =]<br>  <br>  -14 years old.|`|k8ivyYfaaa	I think the law should be state regulated... just like driving and gun ownership.  With that, I think you should be able to drink at the same age you can buy a gun; if you can shoot someone/something, you should be able to get drunk.|`|FnvYkF2Gaa	I'm 20, and no I would keep it at 21.  Because kids at the age of 18 are irresponsible as myself and immature AS MYSELF. So keep it at 21 so we can mature a little :)|`|o83jkGiXaa	If you're considered to be an adult at age eighteen then it only makes sense that you can have adult beverages.|`|oojO4WAraa	No.  18 is too young.  Too bad about the drafted thing - there isn't a draft anyway so that isn't an issue.|`|htSZsds7aa	Keep it at 21, due to the fact we have enough people who abuse alchol on the streets already. Most people arent mature enough b4 age 21.<br>  I also think drivers licenses should be 18 for simmilar reasons. As far as going to war, its always been young men, because older ones have families already.  Protecting your country is more important than drinking a beer.|`|KpcjvUgwaa	Age 41<br>  <br>  The reason you can't go get a beer, is because your on stateside soil...and apt to kill or harm another American when you become an idiot...I mean drunk.<br>  <br>  People that drink are inferior anyway. People that would, by choice, put themselves in a position to harm themselves, or harm / kill another human being....yah....thats your first and best sign of an IQ deficiency.<br>  <br>  The drinking age should be 24 or older....most poeple aren't truly mature until their mid 20's|`|TzkV8Ivraa	Not. I would like there to be a law stating if you are a police officer, fire fighter or military personnel you are legally able to consume alcohol. The draft hasn't been enacted in decades so I would limit it to those who are signed up currently.<br>  <br>  I don't need a irresponsible teen with a years driving exp. out boozing it up while I might have my family in the car.|`|Y0j4N2x0aa	i am 34.  i think it should remain at 21 except for members of the <br>  military.<br>  <br>  18 is just way too young and immature.|`|zO2awoZQaa	Yes, because studies have shown that it would more then likely initially show results of teen deaths, but eventually in the long run it would cut down the death rate associated with teen drinking.<br>  <br>  Oh, and they're going to drink it anyway...<br>  <br>  (edit)<br>  <br>  To just wondering,<br>  <br>  Sorry about your friends dying in HS, but I take it the drinking age was 21correct? And what exactly is the diffrence between an 18 year old driving drunk and a 21 year old? Nothing, because drunk driving isillegal. Sad thing is that an 18 year old doesnt even have to be over the normal limit to get a DUI. What your friends did was illegal and they did it anyway. What does that tell us? I think we can see that the drinking laws don't work nor are they even much enforced.<br>  <br>  (edit)<br>  <br>  I'm 23, and when I have children best believe they will be educated on safe drinking, because I know that eventually between age 16 and college more then likely they will experament with a drink or three. I want my children to be safe like I have been. I want them to know that I'm not going to punish them for small drinking mistakes. I'd rather have their trust because if and when they get drunk and need a ride home, rather I pick them up then the city mortuary.

Cualquier persona que tenga una empresa, un trabajo propio o sea profesionista, comerciante, etc, que no dependa del gobierno es de derecha. Generalmente en ella están los grandes empresarios y la clases medias. <br>  <br>  La izquierda es igualitaria  y tienen varios programas de ayuda a los más pobres, o a la gente que trabaja en el estado; como la educación y salud públicas. De ahí te explicas el porque AMLO le da una pensión a los ancianos y porqué Ebrard hace las playas públicas en el DF. La izquierda es partidaria de la nacionalizaciones de empresas y de que todos los habitantes del país se conviertan en empleados del estado como en la URSS y Cuba, o de ayudar con internet gratis, programas de alfabetización, playas públicas, segundos pisos, etc, como el PRD, que además permite la inversión privada. <br>  <br>  Aquí en México los trabajadores de PEMEX y CFE, toda la educación pública, viven del estado, porque son empresas estatales. Antes había bastantes empresas nacionalizadas por el gobierno como TELMEX, por ejemplo, pero se han privatizado porque el banco mundial le sugirió a México que privatizara muchas de sus empresas estatales y porque en la crisis económica del 82 ya no se podía mantener a la burocracia. Al privatizarse, ahora todo el dinero va al due?o o due?os de la empresa y no al estado; de ahí te explicas el porque hay en México personas tan ricas como Slim, Azcarraga, Arango, Garza Laguera, y Aramburuzabála.<br>  <br>  La derecha es el capitalismo individualista, del cual presume y defiende a capa y espada norte?a el compa marco, jajajajajajajajajajajaja.

Se le dice que es extrema izquierda cuando se le considera comunista (o neo comunista como actualmente se le conoce).  Todos estos socialistas quieren ver la igualdad entre todas las personas y siempre apoyarán mayormente a las clases populares.<br>  <br>  Un partido derechista, es un partido que tiene como enfoque el crecimiento económico del pais, reformas económicas,  una "buena" estructura administrativa, etc.  La extrema derecha hace referencia a los capitalistas.

Claro que también realizan ayuda social, pero no es su principal focus.<br>  <br>  Un partido se puede guiar por ambas ideologías, es decir se puede declarar "centro izquierda o centro derecha" es decir, que ni es chicha ni limonada, pero puede saber un poquito mas a chicha o un poquito mas a limonada.<br>  <br>  Hoy en dia casi no existe partido politico cuyo sistema no sea democrático hasta cierto punto.

Y servian para diferenciar de que lado estabas.<br>  Con la caida del muro de Berlin muchas cosas cambiaron y creo que esos terminos cada vez sirven menos, pero no se han inventado otros mejores. Asi que siguen teniendo el mismo significado: la derecha es proempresarial, la izquierda es revolucionaria, con tendencias socialistas y estatistas.<br>  <br>  La derecha se dice democratica, pues es liberal e individualista. La izquierda denuncio el juego democratico como una tomada de pelo por parte de los burgueses (eso fue en los sesenta y setenta), pero para los ochenta decidio que si queria ser democratica. La integracion del PSUM (Partido Socialista Unificado de Mexico) fue esa aglutinacion de la izquierda que trataba de llegar al poder por medio del voto (y no por medio del cuerno de chivo).<br>  Con la candidatura de C.

HZvdr8VLaa	Many states have a requirement of an arrest in a domestic battery case.  You have nothing to do with it, the state is required to prosecute your boyfriend.  The 'battery' or assault committed by his brother may very well NOT be viewed as a domestic battery, unless you are in a relationship with BOTH brothers... I won't ask.   These will be two different types of charges, the more serious will be against your boyfriend.  He will be unable to buy firearms and ammo if convicted of domestic assault or battery.  I would walk away from it if I didn't want my bf charged.  You can't have it both ways.|`|525m5qrTaa	I withdraw my comment as I do not have an answer for your question; I will not be offended if you leave a thumbs down. I was wrong...|`|mzkfSwLwaa	I live in fl to i use to live in orlando but now live in MIAMI and the laws here are wack... but he will get arrested because it was a fight between all.  Good luck dealing with fl.|`|MYU46ap5aa	Not sure because I live in NY.<br>  <br>  But how could your boyfriend sit there and let his brother assault you. <br>  <br>  I hope he's not your boyfriend anymore.
SeJ1Hnfraa	Dear generally speaking YES..but it often depends on the type of crime.If you were put in jail or had a guilty verdict for something such as Shoplifting,drunk driving ext ext...you probably wont..anything beyond that will defiantly get you deported or at least make you eligible for further immigration benefits such as US citizenship.If I were you I would contact an Immigration lawyer since this is a serious issue<br>  Good luck!|`|Irjopfpvaa	After he served his jail sentences then he will be deported.|`|CowgOqXTaa	Depends. <br>  <br>  An alien who is convicted of a "crime of moral turpitude" is, in many cases, subject to deportation. There are, however, exceptions for things like minor crimes such as shoplifting, even though it is a crime of moral turpitude.<br>  <br>  However.... Immigration only acts when they know about something. Many States, including my own, have "State of refuge" laws under which law enforcement personnel are barred from co-operating with ICE. In such States, the conviction is not reported to ICE, so unless something comes up that triggers an ICE background check, they will not know he was convicted, and therefore will not act to deport him.<br>  <br>  Richard
MPX0f5jzaa	That's not a matter for Lunchables (Oscar Meyer), but for your grocery store.  Why can't you just return it?|`|2ZOkyoSJaa	Call the number on the package and they will send you some coupons for free lunchables, just let them know what you think would be fair for your inconvenience. You can't sue them unless they hurt you in some way. Like if you ate a piece of metal that was in the food.|`|AtLdnZd5aa	only if it happened to ALOT of people then you could file a class action lawsuit. but just one occurrence, no. there are laws that dictate how much bad stuff can happen and the company be protected. example, grasshoppers get into cans of green beans, it just happens, and they are allowed a certain amount of this before they are held liable.|`|agyl1OEqaa	I think it may be the store's fault. Did you check the expiration date? If the store sold it after the exp date than it is their fault, but if not, it is the makers of lunchables fault. However, it would be very hard to sue them. You may want to just call them and complain and get some coupons or free stuff. To sue, you probably would have had to come down with an illness from it.|`|zqPjdhgKaa	What are you going to sue for?  You would have had to lose something financially as a result of the lunchables.  You didn't eat it, you threw it away more than likely.  There isn't anything you would be able to do.  It sounds like it was becoming moldy.|`|r6dsc5fNaa	Well, I'd e-mail whatever company makes lunchables (I think it's Kraft or something) and explain it to them. If you have pictures, somehow, send those too. They'll probably send you a bunch of coupons or something.|`|ZNe6B9TQaa	There is nothing to sue over; you did not ingest it and subsequently get ill and therefore, only lost a few dollars.<br>  <br>  There are two things you should do:<br>  (1) If you haven't already thrown it away, then take a picture.  Send Kraft an e-mail at this link regarding the weird substance:<br>  <a href="http://kraftfoods.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/kraftfoods.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=34&p_created=1070859600&p_sid=D3rtGmsj&p_accessibility=0&p_redirect=&p_lva=&p_sp=cF9zcmNoPSZwX3NvcnRfYnk9JnBfZ3JpZHNvcnQ9JnBfcm93X2NudD02NjksNjY5JnBfcHJvZHM9JnBfY2F0cz0mcF9wdj0mcF9jdj0mcF9zZWFyY2hfdHlwZT1hbnN3ZXJzLnNlYXJjaF9ubCZwX3BhZ2U9MQ**&p_li=&p_topview=1" rel="nofollow">http://kraftfoods.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/k...</a><br>  <br>  Let them know about the lunchable and its mystery substance.  Also inform them that you need to be compensated for the purchase of this item, and address the issue of cleanliness in their factories.  Point out that while you noticed the stuff before eating it, someone else may not have.  They will probably send you a check for $10.00 and some lunchable coupons.  They might call you if they are more concerned for some reason or another.<br>  <br>  (2)  Check the expiration date.  If it's passed date and was purchased after it was passed date, then you need to do the same thing with the grocery store it was purchased from.  In this scenario, do both since it's not really your job to determine whose actions were at the root of the mystery poo.  If it's not passed date, but you still have the receipt, then return it irregardless of the poo and it being opened (they will accept should accept it irregardless).<br>  <br>  ADDITIONAL:  The explanation you give for why you should report it, i.e. a five year old might eat it, is exactly why you need to get in touch with kraft foods.  Plus, you need to let them know immediately that you consumed a piece of potentially harmful cheese.  Although a "red throat" is not a medical condition, what if it eventually developed into something much worse as a result of ingesting some animal carried disease or other.  Even if you think it might have been passed date you should let Kraft know.  <br>  <br>  I commend you on recognizing that you need to communicate w/Kraft in order to potentially protect other people from becoming ill!! :)|`|y42LEQL3aa	Lunchables had nothing to do with this. Either you, or the store let it expire most likely. Just go back to the store that you bought it at and they'll replace it.<br>  <br>  Besides, YOU DONT HAVE A CASE! You'd be laughed out of the court room for bringing such a frivolous lawsuit. In order to actually sue, you would have to have incurred some sort of damage. If you ate a Lunchable and it gave you food poisoning, you might have a case for medical bills, but you can't just sue because you were upset you got a bad Lunchable. It's a $2.50 meal GET OVER IT.<br>  <br>  Our country is in bad enough shape as it is without people like you looking for excuses to sue. NOT EVERYTHING IS A GODDAMN LEGAL ISSUE!<br>  <br>  Besides, you're like 12, you can't sue anyone.|`|B1MnNcI8aa	If you are poor, why are you buying  "red lobster" lunchables?  You are foolish with your money.  Stay within your means, and start making your lunches from leftovers of the night before or bologna & cheese.  There are a jillion other options to have lunch and spend less.<br>  <br>  My advice, spend your money on a lawyer and sue, you'll be broke in no time!  Very foolish!  You should be ashamed of yourself.
