Every morning i have to go to the bathroom. I was wondering, 1) is it normal, and 2) if anyone else has had the crazy symptom happen to them. I am really laughing but i am also a little worried see i know they say diarrhea can be a sign of ectopic as well.  ( I am going to ask my Dr just want to know what the yahoo answers community thought)      All answers are welcome except the childesh ones saying stuff like "eww your gross" and stuff like that.

20080926175513AAkS9Lp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Breastfeeding with nipple shield?	I have flat nipples and was told to use a nipple shield while feeding my newborn (she's 6 weeks old).  She's been weighing a little heavy (the doctor said she was gaining about 1.5 oz a day) so I was told to stop waking her up for feedings and basically let her tell me when she was hungry.  That was 15 days ago.  We went to the doctor yesterday and she weighed less than she should.  So, I'm waking her up for feedings again.  My question is, could the nipple shield be the problem  (reducing my milk supply) or, since this only happened when I stopped waking her for feedings at set intervals, is it more likely that she wasn't eating as often as she needed to?  She was eating 8 times a day minimum and having 3 poopy diapers a day.  Now, she's eating every 4 hours at night and every 2 or less hours during the day and has about 3-4 poopy diapers.  Any ideas?  I'm just worried...

20081012180803AAL7G1R	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is this normal for a baby?	So, I am an over-worried typical first- time mom and I am concerned that my baby is not breathing normal.       My baby is 4 weeks old today and I have noticed that after every feeding (by bottle that is) he sounds like he is trying to clear his throat... like he is congested. Then, today I was at a friends house when her sister noticed that he was acting "weird" as she put it. This girl is only 18 but she does have a baby of her own and she said her son didnt do this. I asked her what she meant by acting "weird" and she couldn't explain it but she said my baby's face was turning red and he was breathing odd... so whatever that means. He always looks a Little red to me... I don't know.       My point is, I have been thinking he breaths a little weird myself but this is my first baby so I dont know really what to look out for other than the obvious. When she said that though it really worried me... Did any of you think this about your baby when you first had them? And what about the congested sound after feedings? Thanks.       BTW, I have a doctors app. for his 1 month check up on Tues. and I will also confirm with the doctor also.       
20081010122030AAgucd6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Is this normal for a newborn?	My baby is almost 4 weeks old. He was a 10lb 6oz baby and is already eating 5-6oz every 4-5 hours.       Im a little worried because last night he fell asleep at 1am this morning. I had to wake him up at 10:30a this morning because that is already 9.5 hours of sleep. He usually sleeps about 5 at a time. He has also slept for 7 about a weeks ago. I just figured that 9.5 hours of sleep is a long time to sleep without eating. On top of that I had to wake him up. He just ate and now is back asleep... What is happening with him? I took his temp. and it is 98.6. So he is not running a fever... am I over- worrying?       Also, he has a little case of thrush, and I just started treating him yesterday with an oral medicine. Not sure if this could have anything to do with it.

20081012210428AAxstVD	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	15 year old wondering about threesome?	I'm a 15 year old girl, with a boyfriend of almost ten months, and we started having sex on our 7-month. (I figure that's pretty important with what I'm asking)      He always jokes around about having a threesome with me and my best friend just because he loves trying to get me jealous (in a joking way, not a serious way). Well, him hitting on my friend made us start talking, and I've always been kinda curious what it'd be like to be with another girl, so I told him if he can find a pretty, nice girl (not some gross or b*tchy girl), and it isn't someone that I'll run into later and feel awkward about, then I'll do whatever he wants. (threesome, me with the girl, whatever.. just not ONLY him and the girl cause that seems a little too weird for me, I wouldn't want to watch him with someone else if I wasn't involved.. he can do that when he's single)   I'm not a jealous person, I don't mind him flirting with other girls because I know he wants to be with me, and vice versa. And I know adding another girl into sex wouldn't make either of us jealous, if it was just a one-time thing. And, last thing, I don't want to hear people saying I'm too young for sex. That isn't what this is about.. I don't want to be lectured on my age or morals or how "God" doesn't want me having sex, or how I shouldn't have sex with someone when i KNOW our relationship won't even last out of high school.      I just want to know who thinks this is a really bad idea, and who thinks I should go for it.      (oh and I don't want to hear about STD's either.. I'd make sure we were all checked out just in case)

20081029100210AAb3CA6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is this an appropriate or overreactive punishment for an 8 year old girl?	We have four kids. All are good kids, three are eeeeeasy kids, to my way of thinking. They know what is expected and do it. Their older sister however is very manipulative and so on, so forth. She can be a good girl. But....      Last night we took all our kids to a public event held by the Sheriff in our county, a halloween night. They got candy and prizes for their costumes. We are not well off people so it was trouble but worth it just to drive there, so they could have some fun outside the home for once, basically. The whole evening, though we'd eaten prior to going, and had said we will not be buying drinks or food, she kept asking for the drinks they had (which you had to pay for, and were not good for little kids.) We didn't do it, coz we couldn't anyway, and she knew it. We didn't get after her or anything, just said We're going to the store before we go home, and getting some milk. You can have chocolate milk or water. She was fine.    We went to the store. It's where I work, actually. She has had meltdowns there since she was four, but had recently stopped, so I started taking her there again. We get to the checkout line, all of us, and she stares at the pop bottles and argues about how I one time said she is allowed clear pop and that is it. Like it mattered that evening. I reminded one time about the chocolate milk we made at home. She threw herself on the floor and wouldn't et up, kept shrieking I CAN'T WAIT. This is a bright 8 year old doing this now! Acting 2. I couldn't pull her up coz my arms were weakened by a treatment last Monday and she knew it so I took my sons and let my husband get her. Cashiers stared of course. :D We got to the van and he said she is not allowed back in there again. There is a Halloween party there tomorrow evening that we had planned for weeks to take them to. Can I still take the boys and not take her? I bought costumes just for it and we are expected. Or should I take her and ignore husband's ban? Is she old enough to connect not going with her behavior, and LEARN from it, and not just sullk and be like "it's not fair."

For example, they bought him this skateboard type thing, called a RipStik, and they paid about $65 for it. A few months later, he sold if for 10 dollars. This kid is 12 years old btw, and he runs their lives. He is so disrespectful to parents, teachers, his peers and me, and even when my friends come over... He swears at my mom, raises his fists to my dad. He hurts our dogs, he throws our shih-tzu around the room, bites the fur off their ears, pokes at them, he is completely obnoxious... I am forever arguing with him, he does whatever he wants, and he is always getting away with it. He is severly overweight, he is 200 lbs, and he eats constantly, and it annoys me. We have to grocery shop twice or more a week. I have to hide food for myself and my mother, and even then, he sometimes finds it. Other parents don't want him around their children, and he tries getting tough with my guy friends for no reason. he is loud, annoying, talks constantly, farts, burps, and has no matters whatsoever... This house is out of control! I've tried telling my mom to step up and be a parent, and discipline him, but it seems like nothing works, and she gets mad at me for saying that she isn't doing her job as a parent. Help?
20081030114148AAVYX89	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Are all parents ready to take their infants to learning centers, under Obama's "Zero to Five" plan?	Do you know that Obama's "early childhood education" means that he will force your child to attend learning centers from infant to age 5? Yes, you don't believe it, but you have to read between the lines. He says it will be voluntary. It won't! The voluntary part means that there will be a penalty you wouldn't want to incur if you don't. He says from infant, yes, infant, you will be required to take your infant to a learning center. His program is called the "Zero to Five." This is very scary people. This is what communist countries have done for centuries, the babies are indoctrinated on up through childhood. A vote for Obama means putting your infants under mandatory supervision of Obama's "Zero to Five" schooling. Read it here.  http://www.barackobama.com/pdf/issues/Pr...

Boys often feel very lonely and in need of female affection. Unfortunately many high school boys just don't have enough game to get a girlfriend. With hormones out the roof this is a recipe for major depression which can lead to suicide.      So should High Schools and Universities be aloud to open brothels so that these teenage boys have an outlet to release their sexual frustration?

We just got home from a long walk so I changed my little girl and put her on the floor to play. She's 6 months and 3 weeks old. Anyway, I was standing right next to her and she just starts screaming out of nowhere. Like, hysterical sounds like she's in pain scream, so I pick her up to see what's wrong and she's just gasping and screaming like crazy. I went and made a bottle and fed her, rocked her, and talked sweetly to her and she calmed down but now her right eye is really red and swollen. I have no idea what could have happened. There is nothing at all on the floor where she was at. She seemed fine, happy and looking around and then crying like crazy out of nowhere. I don't know what happened but I feel awful. It wasn't like I left her or had anything dangerous around her. Could she have poked herself in the eye with her finger or something? Now she's napping and I got her nice and calm but her eye looks bad. Any other moms have this kind of thing happen?

I am concerned because he says he has friends at school, but none that express any interest in calling him or coming over.  I have watched a few times when he is with other boys--he seems to be an outsider---he hangs around them, but they dont seem to pay attention to him.  He has never had a friend over, except the girl who lives across the street and now she rarely comes over.  Maybe I am overreacting, but I am concerned that I am doing something wrong in raising him.  He has been in band for 3yrs now and enjoys it, but has not even made one single friend in the band.   I dont ask him questions or push the issue with him, but I think he realizes this and feels bad about it.  He's very social and likes to go to school dances and other school functions, but he cant seem to form a relationship with other peer boys.  I am worried that he may do something wrong just to please a friend.  His self esteem needs a boost what can I do??  Any advice would be appreciated

Do you let him suck on your finger?      When do you do it? In his sleep?      At his check up the doc said he has a lot of wax. He scraped it out with a white scraper thing.

But, if it was okay, then why did he feel the need to scrape his ears out and why was all of that wax built up?      What do you do? I feel like the baby q-tips are not doing a great job.

I am also grounded for the next three weekends. Ugh!! Tonight I have to be in my room, and quiet. I can come down for dinner in about an hour and that is it. Is she being too severe?

I tried to go back to putting the reccomended amount of scoops and she just spits it out.  She likes the extra scoop.  do you think i should keep putting the extra scoop or what?      example:   Normal amount: 3 scoops = 6 oz of milk   My baby drink:  4 scoops = 6 oz of milk      What do you think

Also what about the ovens? Should I be around them? Oh ya and what about the chemicals like sanitizer and oven cleaner? Thanks!!

20090227172610AAYCuY4	Pregnancy & Parenting;Grade-Schooler	Help! What do we do about a 9 yr. old, with possible ADD who lies and steals?	Our 9 yr old grandson we think has ADD and so does his teachers, but his parents have not have him tested yet. He has always had a problem with taking little things from school, homes visited, stores, etc. Things that will fit in your pocket. as a preschooler, it was little things that he would take and hide them under his pillow and lie about it. He has not stopped. He also sneaks food and hides it, and this boy gets plenty of food, so this is hard to understand. He was suspended from school today for stealing a paint cake from art class, and it was the second one this year. His parents have tried: spanking, grounding, taking toys away, having him write letters of apology to the affected parties, do extra chores, etc. Nothing seams to be working. Any Ideas? We think he needs counseling and evaluated for ADD. But what else can we do? We do not want him to end up a j.delinquent. Also he is the one child out of 4 that will help you with any task that needs to be done. He has a very loving and kind heart, but just can't seem to get this stealing and lying under control. Any advice?
20090227172921AAomtfn	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Morning Sickness HELP?	This is my 1st pregnancy. I started the "morning sickness" stage now. My morning sickness lasts like ALL DAY. It is hard to eat anything. I haven't been able to eat much of anything. So mostly I'll have an empty stomach. Yes I know that is not good, but it's hard to try to eat something when you're nauseous ALL DAY. What ever I do eat whether it be a little or A LOT the nausea REALLY starts to kick in and just feels like I'll throw up at any minute and in some cases I do end up throwing up what I ate. VERY hard to keep food down it seems.  I hate having an empty stomach, but I mean what can I do? Empty stomach and nausea at the same time is not a good combination. But like I said before even if or when I do eat something my body is tryin to make the food come back up. My only relief is trying to go to sleep after I eat. Seems when I sleep is the ONLY time I'm not bothered with nausea and the food is being digested and hopeing the baby inside me will get what ever nutrients I can provide. Haven't gotten my prenatals yet, but I am scheduled for an appointment next week.

20090227175451AA7pDst	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Have any of you ever used an OPK as a HPT and still gotten an accurate result?	I haven't had my period at all this year and have gotten negative test results. About 3 weeks ago, I got 3 super faint positive EPT tests and ALL others are negative, including digital tests and cheap ones. So I figured I'm not pregnant.       Awhile back I bought OPK's since I'm planning another baby. Anyway I should have technically ovulated a long time ago as the first day of my cycle this month SHOULD HAVE been the 2nd and that would put me at like 24 days into a 28 day cycle.      A few nights ago, I took an OP to see what it would say~~the purple lines were both present and both purple and both dark!! Like I said, I should have ovulated already this month, so why would it show positive now? Have you ever taken an OP as an HPT and gotten an accurate result?      Any info you have that is not off of peeonastick.com would be greatly appreciated!      Thanks ladies!

They said it was viral and just wait it out and help her discomfort by giving her tylenol.  Thursday her cough had just gotten worse and she wasn't acting right..so I brought her in again.  They said she had developed an ear infection in her right ear.  Well they gave me amoxicillan ( sp?? ) antibiotic and she had it 2 times so far and she is acting so sleepy and still sick.  I realize it was only 2 doses and it may take longer but how long?  Her cough is really bad and keeping her up.  I hate to see her like this...it breaks my heart.

20090227175546AAqHuMI	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	Compliment to the person or the baby?	My Social Studies teacher recently had a baby girl with his wife, and brought in pictures of her (his baby) to show the class. I though she was cute and told him so after class, to which he replied "Thank you."   This struck me as odd, as it was more of a compliment towards his daughter than to him. It's not like I complimented a sweater of his, in which one would say "Thank you" in regards to their fashion sense.      So if someone compliments your child, how do you respond if the child can't respond for themselves? Was saying "Thank you," correct of him, or do people do it another way?      Thank you! I'm just curious, and his comment got me thinking :) :)
20090227181016AArFycd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Does anyone know what this is? 22 weeks pregnant?	Since last night before i went to bed, I have had massive vaginal pressure. Last night while i was sleeping i woke up more than 10 times bc the pressure was so intense it was making me nauseous. Then this morning it still hadnt gone away, so i called the doctor and they told me to come in. My obgyn told me that my baby has just gotten alot bigger and im going to be feeling pressure from time to time. They checked me for a uti and bladder infection, and it came back negative for both. With the pressure, I am also having shooting pains from my extreme lower abdomen to about my belly button. The shooting pains are only when i actually get out of bed and walk. No matter how much i walk around it never gets better, and i start hurting and getting frustrated with not being able to walk comfortably, to the point that it brings me to tears. Also, twice today I have felt my stomach tighten in a ball. Its not painful at all, but my lower abdomen just gradually tightens up and then as soon as i can think...what is that?! It fades away. I just want to make sure that this is something other people have had, and that it sounds pretty normal. I told the doctor all of these things, and he blew it off to a baby laying in a bad spot. Does this sound about right? Keep in mind i am only 22 weeks.

20090227174839AAA2VHu	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What should a mother do?	How would a mother feel in this/what should she do?   How would a mother feel if her little girl about seven years old is taken against her mothers will to Germany, by her father? She was born in American and has lives her first seven years in America. A year later the German courts ruled that they are not required to send her back to America under Hague Convention, because she has no trouble interrogating in Germany society.  This will hold up on appeal. In Germany they say that is inhuman to send her to America (a horrible country to live in a diplomatic friendly manner) and away from her German father. She is living with her German father and has a better home than most American children have. Her father takes good care of her, better than most American parents. The father is not facing US federal charges, and the American FBI and German police will protect her from her American mother and State of Virginia. The US embassy says that you can’t get a US passport for your daughter until she is 18.  The American mother is informed that she can only have supervised visitations with her father (and regular phone calls) as long as you the mother agrees to recognize the German court order. This means that you the mother has to drop all legal court action in the courts in the State of Virginia. This is what an international divorce lawyer will tell you.       Because she is raised properly she still wants her mother to visit her regularly as long as she is assured that you will not take her away from her a German father. She is not brain washed, but considers her self a German national.
20090227180854AAH0sL1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How would this little girl feel?	How would a little girl (in elementary school) feel when she was kidnapped by her mother and one year later she was found and was send back to live her father.  She has a very good father.  She did not know that she was kidnapped until the police located her.  Her parents were married at the time.  Her mother was sent to jail.  A judge says she can’t ever see her mother again with out her fathers consent until she is 18 years old.        Her father tells her that she can have regular supervised (for her own protections) visitations with her mother, if she wants to but does not have to.  Her father says that if he does not allow this he is no better than her mother.

Hace ya algún tiempo tuve relaciones con mi novio: usamos condón, no estaba en mis días fértiles, tomé la píldora del día siguiente y me bajó (4 días después de cuando debía, quiero creer que por la pastilla) aún así el temor seguía en mi y no me dejaba dormir, así que me hice una prueba de orina (en laboratorio) y salió negativa, pero el enfermero me dijo: "sí no te baja 20 días después de cuando te debería bajar, vienes" y me bajó (otra vez) 3 días después de que me hice la prueba.. pero ?qué creen? sigo con miedo de estar embarazada!!      Mi mamá me asegura que sí se llega a enterar que tuve relaciones antes del matrimonio, me deshereda u_U cosa que se me hace patética y creo yo, es el punto de partida de mi probLema porque no tengo confianza en ella, porque no puedo apoyarme en ella para poder ir con un doctor y que me diga tooooooooodos los aspectos de una relación.. como por ejemplo ?Es cierto (normal) que a una chava con 3 meses de embarazo le baje aún su regla?..

20090227174456AAYQcIW	Pregnancy & Parenting;Toddler & Preschooler	I never got my daughter's ears pierced, and she wants to now...?	Ever since my 2 year old daughter saw a pair of my earrings she liked, she has wanted to put earrings on, but she doesn't have her ears pierced...      I used to not want her to have them pierced, but now since she wants to I was thinking about getting them...      I know the older they get, usually the more it hurts. Does it have a higher chance of becomming infected? Does it have anything to do with it?    I am not really sure.       Thank you.

20090227173512AA8ZihL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	How would a nitwit feel?	How would a mother feel if her little girl about seven years old is taken against her mothers will to Germany, by her father to shovel donkey dung? She was born in American and has lives her first seven years in America. A year later the German courts ruled that they are not required to send her back to America under Hague Convention and the nazi regime will not give her back. This will hold up on appeal. In Germany they say that is inhuman to send her to America (a horrible country to live in a diplomatic friendly manner) and away from her father. She is living with her German father and has a better home than most American children have. Her father takes good care of her, better than most American parents. She has no trouble interrogating in Germany. The father is not facing US federal charges, and the American FBI and German police will protect her from her American mother and State of Virginia. The US embassy tells you the mother that you cant get a US passport for your daughter until she is 18 and that shed have to sell donkey dung for 20 yrs. The mother is informed that she can only have supervised visitations with her father  cause he's afraid the mother will find out shes  been boinking him on a regular basisthis means the mother has to drop the court order in virgina where her father and mother practiced incest . This is what an international divorce lawyer will tell you who the german dad had an affair with      She IS BRAIN WASHED

20090227174601AAn1N84	Pregnancy & Parenting;Other - Pregnancy & Parenting	Why do people think...?	...that if they ask a question here, about "OMG am I pregnant!?!?!?!?", they always add "No Rude Comments Allowed" or something asinine like that?  Is that supposed to work?  Do the trolls around here see that and go, "oh, she just wants serious polite answers to her dumb question, I'll leave this question alone and move on."?  Is that supposed to be some Magic-Freakin-Spell that prevents rude comments?      Do you feel that the following statement is true;  If you ask a question, and are compelled to say "No Rude Comments" while you type it, it is because you KNOW that you are asking a stupid question, and will generate many silly responses?

20090227180651AA0QBsU	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Spermicidal lubricated condom, birth control, ejaculated inside her. Will she get pregnant?	My friend's girlfriend had sex with him. She's on birth control but she forgot to take it the day before they had sex. My friend used a trojan spermicidal lubricated condom, ejaculated 2 times inside the condom inside his girlfriend while they were having sex. This next part is random, but she peed 10 minutes after having it. Then about an hour later, she took 4 birth control pills (hoping to substitute it for the morning after pill) then the next morning she took 4 more.      The reason why I'm asking for them is because he asked me for clarity.

20090227173110AA3eYJR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Very early in pregnancy, boy friend disappointed?	So, my boyfriend and I have been trying to have a baby, and I've started to feel some weird cramps and tugging in my uterus and have HUGE waves of nausea come over me. He thinks I'm pregnant, and I'm not getting my hopes up. After him bugging me ALL day, I bought a pregnancy test and took it. I knew it would be negative because if I was pregnant I would only be a week along and figured the hormone wouldn't be strong enough. It came out negative, and he just walked out of the bathroom and went to cooking dinner. He said he was happy, but acting upset. Any ladies have any advice for a situation like this? I haven't given up hope because I know it could just be to early, but I don't think he understands that because he was really hoping it would come out positive.

20090227173346AAyVOK1	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Guys, who would you rather date?	Girl 1 - one of your best friends for at least a year or two. Really really nice, but has a different religion and you don’t find her that physically attractive. You know her well, so you know you like her a lot, at least as a friend, and conversation comes easily. You don’t run out of things to talk about.      Girl 2 - mutual friend/acquaintance. smarter, more physically attractive to you, and same religion - however, you don’t know her that well, so it might not work out. Also, she’s not always as nice as girl 1 is, and she’s really shy, so she kind of freezes up when you try to talk to her, but with time she will come out of her shell.      thanks for taking the time to read and answer, i really appreciate it. :)
20090227173604AAEfuZT	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Dilating at 33 weeks?	I just went to the dr today and she told me that my cervix is soft and starting to dilate she also told me that some women go weeks with out this being an issue and some women don't. she is also worried that the baby is not in either a breech or head down position so the possibility of my water breaking and the umbilical cord coming out first is an issue.. anyone ever had any issues like this and should i be worried i am only 33 weeks and starting??
20090227174512AASspmE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	I checked my cervix-30 weeks. Help?	First of all, I washed my hands, cleaned my nails and used sterile gloves (handy to have a police officer in the house)      The reason I did this is becuase at 30 weeks my contractions are coming with this intense feeling of the baby pressing down on my cervix. I have been to the doc's so much lately that I would hate to go back for something stupid. So I figured I would just check it myself.       So...I wasn't totally expecting what I felt. First it felt so soft and mushy, which is not at all what I remembered from TTC...I thought it used to feel more like the tip of my nose, and now it feels like...hmmm...I don't know how to describe it, kind of like the inside of my cheek except squishier...I didn't want to push into it to much as I'm afraid of doing anything bad (aka accidently stripping membranes, breaking waters, feeling the baby's head and flying like a bat out of hell to L & D).    So I decided to switch over to find if it was opened or closed. Now, during TTC closed was sooo obvious, it felt kind of all puckered up and this tiny tight little rubber band ring in the middle if that makes sense...but try as I might I couldn't find anything even remotely related to an opening or closing...I thought maybe the cervix was posterior so I checked more around the edges but all I felt was this squishy softness.  So I'm really confused (even though I know I probably shouldn't be in there anyhow so I deserve to be confused). I'm thinking about having DH give it a shot when he comes home as I've heard it's much easier for someone else to check you in pregnancy.          Can anyone help me interrpret what I'm feeling? I think I'm going to start asking for cervical checks from now on. I contract so much all the time I'm worried about my cervix changing this early.

She will moan constantly for about 20-30 minutes during the day while I'm rocking/holding her. I am thinking maybe she is just using her voice to soothe herself (which is way better than crying- which I've heard babies sometime use to block out stimuli and relax). Does anyone have anything similar with their little ones? Just want to check if normal. She is 4 1/2 months old and just started this moaning stuff about a week or so ago.
20090227174529AAv7YJo	Pregnancy & Parenting;Adolescent	Is my daughter emotionally healthy?	my daughter is 15 going on sixteen, and i'm having a hard time figuring out if her emotional problems are just because of hormones or something more.   This all started happening about the age of 13, she attempted suicide. she went to therapy for a few weeks, but they said it seemed like she just got really stressed. then for the next few months she seemed quite happy. After that, i notice she started having really bad anxiety. I tried talking to her about it and it seemed to help for a bit.   Recently though, talking isn't helping her anxiety and it has spiral into something much worse. she has very severe panic attacks, and can't be left alone unwatched for more then a few hours. she cannot stay home alone at all.   She also has outburst of high emotions. she'll go to her room happy. then a few hours later i walk in her rooms totally destroyed. or sometimes she'll go to bed, happy, and just start weeping in the middle of the night.   She goes through days were she's happy, hyper, and stays out all night with her friends(i let her stay out with her friends more since she seems to be more in control when she's around them) and then she'll just crash and burn for weeks and act like she's severely depressed. she won't go to school at all. though when she is having good days she does excels academically in school(she has almost been kicked out of school once for having and an anger burst at school)   i ruled out drugs. and am running out of ideas. I've asked he doctor and she said its just she's at that age, but i'm thinking it might be something worse. what could be wrong?

20090227180621AAoXteZ	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Is slapping an unruly kid okay with you?	While growing up I was slapped by my parents when I misbehaved and I never thought it to be out of the ordinary - I wasn't crazy about it, of course, I guess I just saw it as a tougher, stricter, if still valid, child raising method.       Recently I've heard some people referring to parents who slap children for misbehaving as abusing parents. Those people considered that these parents should be stripped of their parental rights and eventually thrown in jail. I don't hit my son because I never believed in it but I never thought of it as abuse per se - it still got me thinking though, since I don't consider I was abused.      (I'm talking, of course, about smacking your kid for knocking off a vase, not beating them till they're unconscious, that goes without saying.)

Even though my menstruation cycle is sorta irregular, I still think there might b a possibility i might b pregnant.  However i already took those at home tests and they came out negative.  Also i recently started college and am under stress.  Could that be the reason.. its almost October and im still waiting... Please tell me what you think.... thanks
20060927133511AAQsVVx	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Metformin!!!?	My obgyn doc gave me metformin for my PCOS (symptoms: irregular period and some unwanted facial hair, but didn't check the androgens/testosterone hormone in blood) which is supposed to make my period regular. I've been taking it for little more than 3 weeks. But instead of making my period regular, I just had few brown discharges (very little uterus lining) this month, that was it. I always have irregular period (35 - 45/50 days apart), but this time I skipped it :( I was wondering whether it worked reverse for me :( or it may happen. Please help... I'm very worried :(

None of this is in my head...the doctor told me their still could be a chance and its prolly to early to test.

20090225073221AAXzT7p	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	Do you think I may be pregnant?!?!?!?!?	Sorry, I am a little excited.  Haha!!!!!  Well, this is my first time in trying to see if I am pregnant or not through checking my cervix.  I didn't with my son. . . , but I've been checking my cervix the last 3 cycles and after ovulation it's always dropped and felt like the end of my nose and never went back up and I started within a few days. Well, it was really low yesterday and thought my period HAD to be on it's way and I checked it again today and it's the highest it's been this entire cycle.  Even higher then ovulation and it's completely soft and morphed into my vagina tissue and it's CLOSED!!!!  OHMAHGAWD.  I know you shouldn't leave that as a pregnancy symptom, but what do you think?  I would be 11 dpo, but I could very well be 12 dpo which is when it's supposed to move back up if you are!!!!  What do you think guys?

Im curious if anyone else is experiencing this or has experienced this, and hopefully had a quick and happy ending, my son (1 week shy of 6 mths) started waking every 1-2 hrs in the night about 2 weeks ago, it's like he has an eternal alarm clock set, he starts to stir about 30-45 Min's after sleeping then within usually 1-2 hrs he's awake, all it takes is a small bottle and he's back asleep, but the same thing happens all night long, ive tried giving him cereal before bed, bigger feedings at night, he sleeps with me, so Ive tried rubbing his back when he starts to stir or "shushing" him, no luck, im going on 3-4 hrs asleep each night, he had been doing good for awhile then all of a sudden started waking every couple hrs. im hoping it's a quick phase but im starting to feel like this is going to be a long time problem, anyone else go through this?

A couple of days ago my son was playing in his bedroom, and my husband and I were in the living room playing with our daughter Jana (she's almost 11 months). She did something cute so I put my hand up and said "High Five," not expecting her to have any idea what I was doing. Well she lifted her hand right up and slapped my hand. I couldn't believe it, I was amazed!      What's your baby done that's completely surprised you?
20090225072826AAa50P5	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	36 weeks and no doctor visit...?	So I just had my 35 (and a half) week visit yesterday. I was told at my last visit (two weeks prior) that after this week I would be coming in each week. When I went in yesterday, I had my visit with my doctor's partner, so that way I would know her if she is the one that delivers our baby. She told me that I don't need to come in next week, and scheduled my next visit for the 10th of March, which will put me at 37 and a half weeks.      I guess I'm just nervous. Everything has been going great; I haven't had any problems or concerns the entire pregnancy, which is why she said I don't need to come in next week. I just feel like it's so close to the end that I should be getting checked out each week at this point.      To make matters worse, when I went in two weeks ago they did the strep b test and an internal exam, but yesterday all she did was check my blood pressure, urine, and the baby's heartbeat. I feel like I should have had another internal exam to see if I've started dilating yet (I know it's early, but it's not that early!)       I'm probably making a big deal out of nothing; my husband told me not to worry about it because she's the doctor and she knows what she's doing, but it makes me really nervous! I feel like we'll go in for our next visit and something will have gone wrong between now and then and they won't have caught it because we weren't in like we should have been.      Would you call and set up a visit for next week behind her back? I almost feel like I should call my regular doctor and let him know that I want to come in next week, but then I think that it really isn't a big deal, and if I don't go in next week it will actually make this last month go quicker... I guess I just need some opinions. What would you do if you were me?

She suddenly calls last night and goes through this whole thing that she can not watch the child unless she has some temporary legal guardianship thing because she claims if the baby is sick, that NO ONE will see it or treat it because I am out of the country..

I don't smoke, don't drink, don't do drugs, i eat as healthily as possible.      However during week 5 or 6, as i was driving, i left my cell phone in  my coat pocket, while i was talking to my mother for about 15 mins. (Please note, i use hands free cellphone while driving) but it was turned on while it was in my pocket, so it was near my womb.      I did this 2 times.       Will this have any affect on my baby?  I had an ultrasound at past 7 weeks and he was healthy and had a healthy heartbeat, but was wondering on organ formation, will that affect him??      I am avoiding this at all cost now. I just somehow didn't pay attention to the fact that i was putting my "activated" cellphone into my pocket.      Please help.  Thanks!      I do read all your answers and will give 10 pts to best.

20090225072950AA6TdYE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Baby Names	Does Finley Liam sound alright with these names?	AUGH!! We are pregnant with baby #3 and very happy but so up and down about naming the baby if it is a boy. We have decided on the name Finley whether boy or girl (although hubby only likes it for a girl). We have two sons, Brody William (3 yrs old) and Riley James (8 months). Does Finley Liam sound alright with our other two sons names if Finley is a boy? Or is Liam too close to William ( William is hubby's middle name and wanted to name our third child after him as well). Riley's middle name - James is named after hubby's brother.      If Finley is a girl She will be Finley Rose (Rose after my mom)      Boy:   Finley Liam ? (Hubby likes)   Finley Joseph (I like)   Finley Jonathan (I also likes and is my fathers name)      Does Liam sound alright? Or too close to William?      Thanks!      A confused Lyn
20090225072633AAiN4WR	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Parents - How do you handle a rebellious teenager?	Since my oldest son moved out and ventured on his own, my middle son, 17, gradually got rebellious. Disrespectful, doesn't listen to me, refuses to go to school. I have warned him that if he misses ONE more day of school, although I hate to do it, I will call the authorities. School is a must. He has a job as well and I am thinking about putting in his two weeks, since he is still a minor, because his grades are dropping and that too was a rule of mine. As long as your grades are up to par then you can have the job.    He is downstairs blasting his music and not listening to a word I say. We got into a huge argument yesterday where the cops were called. He called them because he was afraid he was going to do something stupid.   I have said things I didn't mean (which we all do), like I wanted him out. I guess he took that too heart.   I feel awful. I am a single parent doing two jobs. Being a father AND a mother.    Any parents of teens out there that can give me advice?

The first day of my last period was right around Feb. 4, 5 or 6...I can't remember the exact day :)  I haven't been on the pill since before my son was born almost 2 years ago and decided to go back on and started the pill on the Sunday after my period started.  After my period I continued the pill, but my husband and I had an oppsie!  I'm continuing to take my pill, but the other day (2 weeks after period ended) I noticed brownish discharge when I went to the bathroom.  I know this could just be a side effect from the pill, but I also read that it could be a pregnancy sign.  I have also felt very fatigued, my right breast has been pretty sore, and I just came down with a slight cold (headache, sore throat, sneezing).  I may just be over analyzing things, but any advice or answers would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!

20090225073354AA5KQK6	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Im 41 wks pregnant, my baby is estimated to weigh 9-6. Dr. thinks I'm crazy because I dont want c sec. Am I?	I have a larger frame, and my mom and aunts all delivered 9 to 9 1/2 babies vaginally no problem. Ever since 38 weeks, when my baby was measuring 8 pounds, 7 ounces, the doctors have been acting like I have a freakishly large baby and I am putting it at high risk for shoulder dystocia. They wanted to schedule a c-section a week before my due date. I kept saying no, I will keep waiting until I go into labor. Now I'm a week overdue, and I am still not dialated at all, and the baby is measuring 9 pounds 6 ounces. They scheduled a c-section for me in a couple days but I'm still hesitant to go through with it, I might cancel it. I'm not afraid of the c-section surgery at all. I just don't think it's right unless it is medically necessary, and to the doctors, a 9-6 baby might sound huge, but for my family history, it is quite normal. Any suggestions?
20090225073521AAjO9GE	Pregnancy & Parenting;Pregnancy	Should you clearly be able to tell you are pregnant at three months?	I think I am just worrying too much, because I had what I assumed to be my period in Dec. and I believe I had one in January as well. I hadn't experienced any symptoms at all until this past weekend when I started having headaches, feeling nauseous, being extremely tired and dizzy, but my breasts aren't sore and haven't grown at all. I took two hpt and both came out negative. If I was three months along, I should be able to clearly tell, right? I realize these symptoms can be common for anything, I just want to be positive! Thanks.

20090225103926AASutZd	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	What do I say when I Don't want my ex to watch my son?	He works all the time and when he's not working he's very tired and most likely getting as much rest as he can. So when he's not looking after our son his new wife is or his brother is.       Now I have to say we don't have custody set up yet because the process is taking slower than I hoped. I don't want his new wife looking after my child since I don't like her nor do I want her parenting ways rubbing off on my child. His brother is not a bad guy but he's been doing drugs for a long time and he's bi-polar and on medication alot. Plus his brothers children are mean/rude kids and I don't like the way I have seen them play with my son in the past.      I have my son almost all the time and for the past year he has only seen his son on day trips with me there (just for the convienence, it's not like I don't trust him). My ex is not a bad person, just not to bright. (on his last day off he still sent his current kids off to his brothers house to be watched, so he could have the house to himself)      I know he likes his son. I personally feel he doesn't know his son well enough to miss him whole-heartedly. and I don't want to say "no you can't have your son for a week" but I don't feel comfortable with who will be watching him and I don't know how to politely tell my ex this.

20090225104743AAjD7W0	Pregnancy & Parenting;Newborn & Baby	What do you do when your baby is fussy? New mom w/questions?	So my daughter will be 12 wks on friday and so far everything has been alright. Although there are those days where ya know your baby is just being fussy and doesn't want anything else but to be held.    Well i was wondering how long do you let your baby cry for?    I know that some people say that it's ok to put them down in their crib and let them calm themselves down but the thing is i always feel so bad hearing her cry. I feel like i'm a bad mom because i don't know what to do and after i've tried everything and all she wants is be be held and i can't because i either have to cook dinner or do something around the house, i feel like im just ignoring her.    How do you other mom's cope?       Also i've always wanted to have a family and a baby and now that my daughter is here, it's wonderful but also stressful at times. Like i feel that i don't get any time for myself anymore or for much of anything. I mean i want to be the best mom that i can be and i'll always put my daughter first. But how can you be an all star mom?    Like how can you still be a good mom, keep the house up, cook dinner and still look half way decent for your husband?    Sometimes everything is so overwhelming?
20090225105059AA4FztL	Pregnancy & Parenting;Parenting	Activity ideas....May be hard to come up with?	My father is ill and has been told to rest at home. He's been put on a breathing machine and is rather frustrated because he isn't able to be social and drive about like he usually does. My 19yr son and I are going to vist him and and to help my mother out later this afternoon. The thing is my father has VERY little interest in us coming to visit and doesn't really have a relationship with my son. I've been trying to think of things the two of them could do together this afternoon, but really couldn't think of any.   Anyone have any ideas?

20071114232543AAN59Vp	Pregnancy & Parenting;Trying to Conceive	?Por qué mi esposo no quiere prestarme sus cosas?	Mi esposo no quiere prestarme uno de sus sueteres viejos para dormir, yo me lo pongo y no quiere, se enoja mucho. Dice que soy super desordenada y que parto el queso manchego muy mal. Yo me voy todo el día a trabajar, el trabaja en su computadora desde casa, cuando llego en la noche no ha hecho la cama, no lava trastos, no se prepara de comer, en fin, al igual que yo dice que no tiene tiempo y que el o piensa hacer nada. Yo tengo virus de papiloma, quiero tener un hijo, el tiene problemas de eyaculación retardada. LLevamos 6 a?os casados.   Y pienso, si no quiere prestarme ni su sueter, mucho menos me presta su semen para embarzarme. Me siento desquisiada, ante la imposibilidad de ser mamá, el tiempo pasa y la relación solo se deteriora, mi reloj biologico corre, tengo miomas, el ginecólogo dice que debo embarzarme pronto. (No lo haré con cualquiera, así que no se apunten, es serio esto, y estoy sufriedno mucho)
