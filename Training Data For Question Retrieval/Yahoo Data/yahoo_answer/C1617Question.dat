20090203154238AAmw5Yt	Travel;Canada;Other - Canada	Did this guy break any Canadian laws?	An American guy who lives in a house 1 mile (1.8 kilometers) from the Canadian border, digs a hole beneath his basement and then makes it a very deep deep deep hole.       He then starts constructing a 1.7999999-kilometer tunnel in the direction of Canada, parallel to the surface level of the flat ground, but underneath.       Because of the spherical earth, as you dig towards the center of the earth, it can take less tunnel distance to carve a path.  Therefore, you cannot draw to scale underground distances to surface distances if you dig deep enough.      As long as the guy doesn't dig a new hole up the other side and find he's in Canada, will he be okay with his tunnel?

20090225065449AAXxvfI	Travel;Asia Pacific;China	Are you a foreigner living in China? What did you do to stay there permanently?	I lived in China for a year and taught English, but I didn't really enjoy the job that much. I LOVED the country though. I feel like I left a piece of myself in China. I have been back in Canada for almost 3 years and I desperately want to go back to live in China, but I'm worried that the only thing I'll be able to do is teach... I am going to University in Canada and I decided to study "Asian Studies" as my major and I'm considering History or possibly film as a minor. I'm going to focus a great deal on learning to read, write and speak Mandarin. When I lived in China before, I picked up on the language a bit, but I was responsible from getting myself from place to place without a translator, so I learned most of my Chinese (Mandarin) from Taxi drivers in Taiyuan, Shanxi. Anyways.... I'm hoping that my education (when finished in 3 years) will allow me to find a job ANYWHERE in China that isn't teaching primary school age children the alphabet. Will the fact that I've learned the language in Canada help me at all? I understand that I won't be as fluent, and I probably still won't pronounce stuff correctly until i've been back for a while.... but will it help me to study this in Canada or should I be looking at a different route of education to find myself a job in China again? Any advice on how to get back to live permanently would be very helpful. Thanks.
