A good deadbolt should be enough.How solid is the door?A security screen-door may be even better.|`|AA10625552	If you just purchased a new home, the chances are very good that the builder used the cheapest lockset they could find.  If you are concerned about safety, you can buy a very secure lockset for about $75 from the local home center/hardware store.  Make sure the one that you buy has a large backing plate for the deadbolt, as well as 3" screws to attach it through the doorjamb into the studs.<br>  Hope this helps.
pcEJMHPMaa	Hydrangea require water.if the bottom of the stem is sealing up it will not get the water it needs. As with all woody stems, if you have a hammer, pound the base of the stem about an inch,cut that part off,this way the healed wound will open back up and allow water to get through the stem to the flower and leaves.don't wait, do it today,if its not too late.|`|be9f617f5a598e41354941dbb40d5e3eaa	They are shade lovers and though they make a pretty cut flower they are not a long lasting one.

4ab292baf553d5f4bc2aabbdf995ce8caa	It sounds like the thread tension needs adjusted.  Please check the book that came with your machine, it should have a section on troubleshooting and show diagrams of your problem and then tell you how to fix it.  it is a simple adjustment you can do easily.....just a slight turn of a small knob or screw usually|`|AA10963967	You probably don't have the top thread going through the top tensioner knob properly.  Take out the top thread and follow the threading diagram picture as you're running the thread from the spool to the needle.  Sometimes the thread just doesn't catch around the tension wheels in the tensioner knob (usually on top of the machine). <br>  <br>  The very last thing you want to do is adjust the bobbin tension. It is very very seldom that this tension goes off.  There should be a small screw on the bobbin case which adjusts the bobbin tension, but as I said, this is very seldom the cause.|`|6N3yjlXhaa	Leave the tension set as indicated in the manual.<br>  <br>  Lift the presser foot every time you thread the machine.  <br>  <br>  This allows the thread to drop into the tension mechanism.  If you thread with the foot down, the thread lays on top and the tension does work.<br>  <br>  Check the bobbin to make sure the thread is feeding from it in the proper direction and through the correct guides.
omegLbOAaa	play around with the Sherwin Williams color visualizer to help you imagine how the colors will look together. It is the best paint visualizer on the web, imho.

They're actually quite hardy too - safe to grow outside in zones 5-9, or you can plant them in a larger pot once they've completed blooming, leave them outside, and then bring them in before the first frost to be certain they'll survive.<br>  Just give them a good look over before bringing them inside to make sure you're not bringing in any other little nasties.

The odor is a breakdown of of the paint and even though it my mix, the adhesion and durability has been compromised.

AKrTZqbKaa	Some plants become weeds if not controlled and will take off causing growth problems. They don't have any natural control and will become a nuisance plant in these areas. They may also attract pests that will be harmful to native crops.|`|AA10421436	I work for the USPS and plant stores ships to those states all the time.  However, their plants have to have a decoration of contents on the box and they go through a quarantine.<br>  <br>  Try Park Seed to get your online plants.|`|AA11468062	Different states have different rules about importing plants.  Sometimes it's because there's a risk of something becoming a weed; sometimes it's to protect the natural botanic heritage of the area, particularly areas which have unique ecosystems that could be disrupted or destroyed by wholesale importing of un-quarantined plants, potentially harbouring pests or diseases.  <br>  Finally, there's the problem of importing plants into an area with agricultural importance, for example importing citrus (or plants with similar pest/disease profiles) into California.  <br>  <br>  Here in Australia we have similar issues with shipping, mostly to Tasmania and Western Australia, and it's prohibited to bring fresh fruit and veg over the state lines, or grapes/vine products into wine regions, etc.
LRSTXXaUaa	i just moved into a small house last year, only 850 sq ft... and here's some of what we have learned: <br>  <br>  everything should have duel purposes...as in - a dresser can also be a vanity, no need for 2 huge pieces of furniture<br>  <br>  clothes that arent for the current season should be boxed up and put away. we have REALLY SMALL closets, so we only hang up the clothes that are for this season and store away the other ones.<br>  <br>  when you were a kid, hiding things under the bed was bad - now, it's really good. I actually made drawers under our bed so i can store things and then easily open the drawers and get them out - and my wife loves it for shoes.<br>  <br>  get furniture that FITS. sounds weird i know - but some people just go out and get the biggest, most comfy couch and don't take into consideration that your living room is only big enough for 2 chairs...also, you don't need a coffee table if you dont have the space....end tables are also great places to put your coffee cup.<br>  <br>  organization is KEY - filing cabinets, wall to wall book shelves, labeled tupperware boxes, etc....are all SUPER HELPFUL. That way everything has a place and you always know where it goes and where to find it. In a small house it is VERY EASY to get over run by clutter - i suggest getting in the habit of cleaning your home twice a week, then after you got the hang of it- back it down to once a week, then MAYBE 3 times a month...no less<br>  <br>  <br>  also, if you can afford it - get a flatscreen tv, it saves on tons of space...in fact IF you can afford space saver appliances, do that too... we have a dish washer that doubles as an island/cutting board, an over the stove microwave saves counter space, a toaster/toaster oven combines 2 appliances into one...etc<br>  <br>  <br>  well, hope those were the tips you were looking for

If you spin the motor by hand let me know if it takes off and spins. Let me know it it is hard to spin. (does it spin freely?) does it take off on it's own with the fan in the on position? ( after you try to spin it of course)|`|OTBYJtKkaa	The humming noise is the blower motor. Either it has failed mechanically and will not rotate or it has failed electrically and the windings are bad, or something is preventing it from turning. If the motor itself has failed it will need to be replaced. The capacitor should also be replaced at the same time. The blower motor is a fairly easy motor to change out and shouldn't require more than an hour of labor. Replacement parts for hvac units are usually only sold at hvac supply houses such as Johnstone Supply, United Refrigeration, RE Michels, CC Dickson, Mingledorphs, etc. Most of the supply houses will only sell to licensed hvac contractors. You will not be able to purchase the parts from the supply house. You might be able to obtain the correct motor from WW Grainger. They sell direct to the public and carry a wide variety of motors. If you are at all handy with some hand tools, it is not terribly difficult to do a motor replacement yourself. Hope this helps|`|Iet6MkBZaa	Sound like the blower mower is shot.

This will also keep away bugs, which would be attracted to the fresh poop, not the stained floor, anyway.<br>  As for the stains, sanding is the only thing I can think of, since the stains have penetrated the top layer of varnish, causing it to discolor. This would also remove any lingering smell from the urine trapped in the wood.|`|E5gaKzCsaa	I sure hope this is your own apartment and not a rented one because you may have trouble getting rid of that much staining.

xmibEEdcaa	Yes. Too large a pot will retain too much moisture for the plant to stay healthy.  Even if you start out with very fast-draining potting soil, the extra water will still build up, not only because there isn't enough root mass to suck it up, but also because soil with no roots penetrating it tends to get compacted over time and therefore stop draining as well.  <br>  <br>  It's better by far to start out with a smaller pot, and repot the plant as it grows bigger.  This is particularly important for plants that like it on the dry side, or which are prone to root rot.  Some plants, like scented geraniums, even like being kept a little bit root-bound - for whatever reason, they stay healthier that way.|`|AA11468062	Only that big pots are expensive, and take a lot more watering than a little one.  If you have big pots to spare then go for it.  <br>  Planting in a big pot won't cause any more issues with roots than planting directly in the ground, but remember that a plant in a pot is dependent on you (rather than worms and other organisms) for its nutrition and water, so make sure you feed it with appropriate stuff (I'd say an organic fertiliser like dynamic lifter or a good compost, but that's my bias).<br>  Benefits to starting in a big pot are that there are less issues with transplant shock, and also if you start in a little pot and forget to repot when you should, the plant becomes root-bound and suffers for it.  Remember, what doesn't kill a plant usually makes it weak, spindly and disease-prone.|`|5qFmukWwaa	If you start it in a large pot the root system will grow out of portion with the portion above the soil level.

oIRLs6Spaa	What you are referring to as "heads" are commonly called traps.  And the answer to your question is no, you don't have to feed all of the traps.  In fact, you really shouldn't feed your plant at all.  You should grow it in a sunny location and let it catch its own food.<br>  <br>  Venus Flytraps get all the nutrition they need from sunlight.  They are green plants, which means that they can perform photosynthesis.  Giving your plant at least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day is FAR MORE IMPORTANT than feeding it insects.  In fact, if your plant got at least 4 hours of sunlight a day and never caught another insect, it would be a very healthy plant.<br>  <br>  In case you are new to caring for Venus flytraps, I'll give you some pointers.  There are really only 4 things Venus Fly Traps require to stay healthy:<br>  1) Sunlight - at least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day<br>  2) Water - rain, distilled or reverse osmosis water only<br>  3) Soil - Nutrient poor soil such as peat moss<br>  4) Dormancy - Venus Fly Traps require a 3-4 month dormancy period<br>  <br>  Venus fly traps like lots of light. Try to give it at least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day. The more you can give it the better. It is best to grow your fly trap outside where it can get plenty of sun and catch its own food. You don't actually have to feed a Venus Fly Trap anything other than sunlight and water. If you do choose to feed it, don't over do it. Feed it only insects and at most only a couple a month.<br>  <br>  Venus fly traps need clean water. Usually tap water will not do. It is best to use distilled water, rain water, or reverse osmosis water. Venus fly traps need water with a TDS (total dissolved solids) measurement of 50 ppm (parts per million) or less. In order to get this, you probably need to use distilled water or reverse osmosis water or rain water. Their soil should be kept wet at all times except during the winter when it should be just moist. It is best to use a tray and set the plant in an inch or two of water.<br>  <br>  If you need to repot, for soil you can use a combination of peat moss and perlite. Most growers use a 50:50 mix of peat moss and perlite. I have been leaning toward using pure peat moss lately. Venus Fly Traps aren't picky, but be sure to use some form of peat moss or sphagnum peat moss with perlite or vermiculite to ensure that the media is nutrient poor.<br>  <br>  Without a dormancy period, your plant's health will start to decline and it will eventually die.

When I googled and got this page and the Hairspray advice saved my jeans, they are dark jeans so I'm the only one who can tell.<br>  <br>  hairspray on a q-tip fades the mark sufficiently Thanks (10/18/2007) <br>  By Deborah<br>  <br>  SHARPIE OFF!<br>  After a whole hour of actually shedding tears over my brand new Victoria's secret yoga pants being ruined by an inch long sharpie line stain I have sprayed my RUSK THICK BODY AND TEXTURE AMPLIFIER (hair product) on it and with a help of toothbrush and dove soap managed to slowly but surely get rid of the stain! PS do NOT use clorox bleach for colors as it will only make the stain run and attack other areas. (10/20/2007) <br>  By Milina<br>  <br>  RE: Permanent Marker Stains on Clothing<br>  Dawn Power Dissolver is amazing at getting permanent marker off anything. I tried it on carpet, tan pants and a cotton tank top. It doesn't bleach the color. I rinsed it in cold water and had to re-apply a couple times. I love the stuff. (11/17/2007) <br>  By ChaoticMom<br>  <br>  RE: Permanent Marker Stains on Clothing<br>  Just got tons of purple sanford sharpie on a neon green columbia! Thank goodness for bar soap and spray and wash. No way was that going to bleach it. 1) Put water and bar soap on it. 2) Let it soak in COLD water for a few minutes (10). 3)Use Spray n Wash--a plenty and scrub. Came out in five minutes. Looks like new! No bleaching! Or chemical that are flammable!<br>  <br>  Hot water sets dyes! Flammable chemicals often bleach! (that's why it appears that the marker is fading). (11/20/2007) <br>  By Knudsen<br>  <br>  RE: Permanent Marker Stains on Clothing<br>  I put permanent marker(purple) on my p.e. shirt. and I was forced to take it off or else I would have to by a new one. I sprayed hairspray and rubbed it with a bar of soap, scrubbed it with an old toothbrush and it was gone! (12/04/2007) <br>  By Moriah<br>  <br>  RE: Permanent Marker Stains on Clothing<br>  Thank you so much! I got sharpie on my dad's Christmas present when the marker leaked through the wrapping paper. I got it out so fast with the hair spray! You guys saved me. It cost 60 bucks, and it was on sale so I could not return it! (12/24/2007) <br>  By David<br>  <br>  RE: Permanent Marker Stains on Clothing<br>  I didn't have any cleaning products in the house, but slightly panicked, couldn't resist trying some way of cleaning my brand new jeans (was sketching some designs for skydiving gear on paper on the floor).<br>  <br>  I sprayed the stains (red permanent marker) with AFTERSHAVE and almost immediately noticed the stains disappear. I then tried cleaning it with toothpaste, which seemed to remove the remaining bits. (12/28/2007) <br>  By JC<br>  <br>  RE: Permanent Marker Stains on Clothing<br>  I used a combination of acetone and rubbing alcohol scrubbing it with a toothbrush, then I washed it in hot water with just a touch of regular bleach (shirt was pink) All but one barely noticeable spot came out. (01/12/2008) <br>  RE: Permanent Marker Stains on Clothing<br>  Michelle, Try using Amodex. It's a cleaner recommended by Sharpie. I've used it extensively on various types of fabric, and it works. Most of the time I can get the mark out completely; at the very least it fades the mark significantly. The only place that I know of that sells it is Fahrneys Pens (www.fahrneyspens.com). (01/28/2008) <br>  By Diane<br>  <br>  RE: Permanent Marker Stains on Clothing<br>  well I agree, they have a reason why they call permanent marker , PERMANENT marker. Well as soon as I got it on my clothes I rubbed cold water on it , hot water only makes the stain WORSE. After I rubbed cold water on it , I have a special soap that is made to take out car paint and is made with a sand-like texture & I rubbed it on my shorts, over time it dried, and BAM its out, not totally but it looks better then it did when it DID have a stain. Not everyone has the same soap that I used, but if you do, then it will work. (02/15/2008) <br>  By Jasmine

Make a deal like a molly screw  and attach to the end of the rod.  Now insert the rod and molly screw deal in to the pipe, and start turning the rod.  <br>  The above is if you have ridged pipe.  Maybe you need to consider new pipe.  You would be surprised at the number of wells that have pipe in them that could not be saved.|`|u4Oba3epaa	Before I can answer, How deep is the well? What type of material is the fallen pipe made of?. If plastic and  you can see where it is, first try using a nylon rope with a grab hook. The type the hardware store sells that grabs one way on round objects. If your well is over 100' deep, you will need to assemble a very sturdy tripod over the well with a hoist or come along. If this is a submersable style pump, its going to be very heavy. But the best advise is to hire a professional.

Gzk1TQFAaa	All my appliances are frigidaire and I haven't had any problems with them.  The washer and (hardly used) dryer are 7years old.  The refrigerator is 6years and stove only 2 years old.  I stayed with this brand because I've been very impressed with their service.  I had a lightning strike which fried the motor in the freezer, called customer service and had it repaired the same day by a very nice, professional repairman.

I get to see all the problems that develop with most models of washers and dryers. Frigidaire like all brands have some problems. They are a little harder to get into and repair but seem to work ok. Some of the models seem to be manufactured pretty cheaply and some flimsy products used in them. I think if I was going to buy a good washer and dryer it would either be a LG or Fisher Paykel. Both are High Efficiency machines and will save you money on both water and electricity. I guess what I mean is that if you pay less for your machine then don't expect them to last forever. Older machines would last for 10-20 yrs but modern ones are great if they last more the 5-8 yrs. Also remember a modern Maytag is actually a Whirlpool. About the only thing left on them that is Maytag is the nameplate..|`|Czj10UTYaa	I am an ex- sears appliance manager and i must agree and say that Frigidaire are not really renown for washers and dryers.I would certainly stick with an american made Kenmore or whirlpool or even a maytag.<br>  If you are prepared , i would purchase a front load high efficiency washer as they are far more superior in their washing ability, water and energy consumption.Buy from a reputable retailer that has a good after sales service.If you buy from sears, do take out the "protection agreement" as it entitles you a one free preventative maintenance check per year as well a lemon guarantee.<br>  Good Luck!|`|AA12041097	I've had other Frigidaire appliances -- refrigerator and dishwasher -- and liked them, but for washers and dryers I've always had Kenmore.

Jh7CmSa8aa	Common practice is to always do a "service upgrade" and a house re-wire as two separate projects.  Personally I would never tackle both at the same time.<br>  <br>  If he upgraded the service to a higher amperage, say from 60 amp fuse box to 100 amp circuit breaker panel he would have needed to change the conductors from the meter to the panel, the conductors from the top of the meter out of the weather head.  The ground rod, if present, should have been fine and he might have needed to change the bare wire from the panel to the ground rod, again if there was even one present.<br>  <br>  Beyond this, depending on your local codes, a wire to the water pipe and a "bonding" or jumper wire between the hot and cold on your water heater may have needed to be installed.  These items depend on whether you have metal water piping or if your local code demands it.<br>  <br>  Those are the typical wiring changes associated with a service upgrade.  If those things were completed, the he did you right.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|VgXKFHypaa	The electrician new what he was doing and he would of told you if he saw a problem.They are pros and they are not fond of house fires.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Depends what was there but generally no, if the circuit had a 15 amp fuse on it and now is connected to a 15 amp breaker it is just as safe as before.|`|215f94929cd73f525c67170c8b14df25aa	You are safer now than you were.  Quit worrying,  your new circuit breakers will throw before your old fuses would burn out.  <br>  If your house was wired when fuse boxes were still in use, you probably have good old copper wire.|`|nDO1RVwzaa	Actually, breakers are no better than fuses for protecting your home.  The reason fuses are now taboo is the temptation to replace a blown fuse with a larger one, which is often very dangerous.   Also, there are now many more electrical items in use than were years ago and therefore the load on the wiring is greater.<br>  <br>  If the electrician was a good one he would have informed you of any flaws in the wiring when he replaced the box.  Since fuse boxes are usually in older homes, the wiring is often in poor condition as well and the insulation will crumble off easily if the wire is bent.  That can result in a fire and that is why the wiring is often replaced when the fuse box is.<br>  <br>  I would recommend giving him a call and asking about the condition of the wiring.  Even if he has to come out again it will be worth it for your peace of mind.  You need to feel safe in your home and this concern should be resolved for you.|`|nyqoPvL2aa	It is possible that something is wrong with the rest of the wiring in your house. However, the electrician was not required to do anything about any of your wiring apart from the couple of feet going into the breaker box... if that wire looked okay then he wouldn't have any reason to replace it. Actually rewiring your whole house would cost way more than $1000 or $1200, a total rewire could cost five or ten times that much. So the price difference probably has more to do with him not having insurance, not having a company truck to maintain, and/or simply being more desperate for some income.<br>  <br>  I'd charge $600-800 for a job like that depending on how many circuits were involved and how much trouble it was going to be to turn the power off and reconnect it. If you're concerned that rewiring does need to be done, take a look at the insulation of the existing wires and see if it looks damaged, or old enough to be brittle. If not, there's no reason to think it's failing...

KrkftOfkaa	You have no ground fault circuit interrupts in your kitchen and bath area.  Basically outdated electrical work and a bit of a potential fire hazard.  You will need to rewire these rooms to fix that.  If you are comfortable doing so and know how to do the work to code, or know someone who is that will help you out, you can do the work and get it inspected.  Otherwise you will need an electrician.|`|16vMIGPiaa	The National Electrical Code requires that outlets that are within 1 meter of a water source (like a sink, shower, or outdoors) must be protected by a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter.  A GFCI is a device that prevents you from getting shocked.<br>  <br>  You can buy GFCIs at Lowes for under $10 each.<br>  <br>  Installing them is really easy if you're handy with a screwdriver and aren't afraid to do a little electrical work.  Basically, you shut off the power to that outlet in the breaker panel, remove the existing duplex outlet, and then follow the instructions for installing the GFCI.  <br>  <br>  I would call this a very minor issue, but then I'm very comfortable doing electrical work.|`|yHI6rfeUaa	It means there is no ground faulted circuit interruptor for the 120 v duplex outlets in Kitchen and Bath.  <br>  <br>  If you know what you are doing, you can fix this.  However since you have no idea what GFCI means, I suspect you really have no idea how to fix it.<br>  <br>  If someone contacts a good ground like running water or a water pipe and the hot lead of the outlet or appliance connected to the outlet is faulty in any way, the GFCI detects this fault to ground and shuts the outlet down.  With no GFCI, the person caught in this situation will most likely be killed, if he is very lucky he will only suffer severe electric shock and after a long recovery he may be back to normal.  This means that GFCI protection is critical and a serious issue.<br>  <br>  Contact qualified electricians to determine the repair cost but get them repaired.|`|bzE5hH8Maa	any outlet within a certain distance of a sink tub or shower   must be gfci   with means the electric will turn off at  the recepticle incase u drop ur hair dryer in the sink or while doing dishes ur coffee pot falls into ur sink.        easy fix    turn power off to house    remove existing   brink to a local harware   and match each 1 to a gfci type    then replace        hint   after connecting the wires to the receptical   just wrap each receptical in some black electrical tape      also maybe take a picture of each receptical   before removing the wires   the just look at picture to see what goes where   good luck|`|jcauTPLZaa	Just add the GFCI outlets yourself its easy to do. YOU DO NOT have to have a dedicated circuit for a GFCI. They also do not need a ground to work, they don't use a ground to trip. They measure the current difference between the hot and neutral not ground.|`|AA11228933	Fortunately, a couple of gfci's installed in your kitchen is not a big expense.<br>  They are recommended by the insurance co's now to insure there is no liability issue regarding getting  zapped  in the kitchen.|`|AA11694765	A GFCI or Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter is a circuit breaker built into the outlet. It provides a quicker, more sensitive means of cutting the power to an appliance in the event of a problem, i.e. dropping your hair dryer in water. Current codes state you must have a GFCI in any outlet within five feet of a water source, your sinks, showers and tubs. If your house is older it's most likely exempt from the code but it's a good idea to install them as a safety feature. You can purchase them at Home Depot for about $15 each and can be installed easily if you have ever installed an outlet. Cut the power at the breaker panel and follow the instructions on the GFCI package.|`|fNuMoHt7aa	95% of the time this means just replacing the out lets with a GFI outlet. Im sure you have seen them. They have the 2 buttons in the middle reset and test.  they are about $15 each. I would not call an electrician for this job because in some areas because an electrician will have to bring everything up to code. meaning running separate circuits which will cost a descent amount of money.  <br>  <br>  Depending on your area you will need a certificate of occupation to buy a house. This is another inspection that looks for smoke detectors and broken concrete, railings, and gfi's. i worked for years flipping and every town had there own petty requirement that caused everyone headaches.|`|AA10825581	It is usually referred to as a GFI "Ground Fault Interruption Circuit". This an outlet that senses water and trips the breaker.  So you don't electrocute yourself.  It must be an older house because this has been part of the electrical code for at least 25 years.  In fact it is not a fire hazard but a personal hazard.  It is a dedicated circuit.  It is a more difficult job with an existing house for the simple matter that you have to route the wires.  You could leave it as is...just don't bring a toaster in to the bath tub.|`|BFai5l9gaa	GFCI is short for Ground Fault Circuit Interrupt.  Putting in a GFCI outlet assumes you have a grounded circuit going to your outlet.  Some of the older homes don't have this and need to have a ground added.  These GFCI outlets are a bit bigger than the standard outlet and are sometimes tricky to get to fit in small or overcrowded boxes.  If your breaker panel supports it, you may simply have to replace the standard breaker with a GFCI breaker.
McvDNMlYaa	Is the whole house poured concrete? Holy cow. I can get you a take off in imperial but not off the limited info on your links. We go by what is called structural drawings mostly for concrete takeoff that take into account frostlines, local building codes etc not to mention the design loads of the structure that vary from area to area.|`|7c6d7b25f213bb9d336a8622e2a37b79aa	I think you need to check with the person who set the course work..... make assumtions on paper is one thing.... but if this was for real.... it could be a costly mistake
gTR0i9weaa	This may or may not be right, but here's a guess:<br>  <br>  When you open the fridge door, the refrigerator's generator has to work harder to keep the temp in the fridge cool, since the cooler air is escaping through the open fridge. Hence everything getting hotter--like how sometimes if you have it open for a long time, you hear its motor kick on and it sounds like it's doing double-time? It is.<br>  <br>  Hope that was even remotely accurate or helpful... just going off of what we experience in our house, with our fridge. :)|`|9ff60ac9f9d64bf7201944b6105d0b55aa	Because it was outside and you were in a hot climate.. who ever said the fridge was even working?Or it's just love.. so make your pick.|`|AA11118886	Because the room is probably in the low to mid 70's with air conditioning or hotter without a/c and the refrigerator air is in the mid 40's.<br>  <br>  That means we have a body temp of approx. 98.6, the room approx. 75, and the refrigerator air pouring out is about 45 degrees. UNDERSTAND?  Making us feel HOT when we feel the 45 degree air.
SGxNgLpMaa	The motor just turns the agitator (spin and wash).  There is a seperate water pump, on most units. Easy things to check, Coupling from motor to agitator transmission or a belt if it is belt driven. <br>  Check out this site it may help.|`|6998fbad5d45919fa3dfb06e0930d588aa	hot point are made by GE they have transmission problems we change them out for about 280 +tax ,it locks up and the motor just hums if you get it done also replace the belt
7lpjlcqCaa	It depends on the fabric content.  If its made out of polyester, then it typically won't hold the dye.  A natural fiber is more likely to hold the dye than a synthetic.  So, silk, cotton,linen and some rayon would be good to dye.  Whereas polyester, lycra, viscose, acetarw etc has bad results.  Usually the clothing manufacturer puts a dry-clean only tag on the label to prevent shrinking, loss of dye etc. if they haven't pre-washed the fabric before making the garment.  Usually you can wash these items without damage, as long as you don't put them in the dryer.  <br>  <br>  You should call your local dry-cleaning service and read the fabric content to them and ask if you can dye it.  I would avoid using RIT dye as it is cheap and produces uneven results.  <br>  <br>  You can also visit this fabric store's website and perhaps call their 800 number to see what they can suggest for a dye for your particular lace.  They have an excellent reputation and a lot of knowledge and expertise in fabric.  <br>  <br>  www.nancyssewingbasket.com<br>  <br>  I sincerely hope that helped you fix your dress.  Good luck!
fJ3dVMPMaa	Yes they can be sharpened.  If they are not beat up too bad.  It's best if you can balance them.  I have replaced mine before and also sharpened with an angle grinder with out taking them off.  I picked up the brush hog with the front end loader and just smoothed off the cutting edge.  Don't get them razor sharp, all they need are to be straight and just enough edge to cut.  If too sharp they will dull immediately and you will be back at step one.|`|W8HsTKs0aa	Much more practical to sharpen.

It will need to be softened, so lay hot, wet clothes on it continuously to soften, then have a basin of water & an old brush & brush & rinse over & over & over.|`|I38WF5aFaa	If its still wet use soap and warm water.  If its dry you can try wetting it with soapy water and placing a damp towel on top of it so the water can soak in.  If that doesn't work try a solvent called Oops.  You can get it in the paint department of most hardware stores.  I would put glue on a cloth and let it dry to test these ideas before trying it on the carpet.  If you use a solvent do a test in a closet or somewhere out of sight to make sure it doesn't affect the dyes.|`|uVy8yEjLaa	can you cut that piece of the carpet out.if not try and pour some vinegar on the spot scrub the stain then rinse with water.white vinegar.you might have to do it a couple of times but it should work.|`|ZS8bHa8Paa	If wet, scrape away excess glue.Mix 1 tsp dish soap with a cup of warm and apply to the glue.

b2714bb3d951fddcb2ba22d41c922fafaa	If you live in the United States, Canada, or Mexico all faucet handles are held on to the valve stem with a screw. If you didn’t find one it probably fell out years ago, and the handle corroded itself to the valve stem. You’ll have to gingerly pry it off the valve stem. Try using WD40 to help in this operation. You may be wasting your time looking for the seat washer. The vast majority of today’s plumbing fixtures are washerless. |`|e05073bced812f1534dbbc25cb31e6bdaa	That screw hole is probably an allen screw. You'll need an allen wrench to remove it.
