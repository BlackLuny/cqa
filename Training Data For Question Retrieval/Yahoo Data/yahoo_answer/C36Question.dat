The White House chief of staff [Rahm Emanuel] said this week that he did not pay rent during the five years he bunked at the Capitol Hill home of Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn). But that raises questions whether Emanuel reported the rent-free lodging to Congress, since DeLauro is married to pollster Stan Greenberg. And will either of the parties report what could be “imputed income” to the IRS? Reps for Emanuel and DeLauro argue that House Ethics rules allow “hospitality between colleagues.”

Democrats want to play the blame game to defend Obama but are unwilling to be honest and fair about the blame game. The blame game does not work because we can track blame way further back than Bush... if you are going to blame Bush you have to blame Clinton who put many bad policies in place. Also blame yourself, it was you who put Obama in office... the most inexperienced, racist and dishonest President in recent history.

20090220040657AAd2VCu	Politics & Government;Military	What's the difference between "landing" and "crash landing"?	During WWII, Russian pilots fired at an american plane... one engine caught on fire, there were other fires, the tail was badly damaged, one tire was blown, the oil tank exploded, and the pilot believed the entire plane might explode. He managed to ditch the plane along the shore, but came in so non-level, that the propellers hit the ground and bent.... after the crew escaped, and the fires were put out, the plane was no longer flyable, even after a rescue plane with spare parts were sent to repair it.      The enemy "which said it was shot down in error" had the pilot sign a statement (the pilot did not speak or read Russian so he couldn't read the Russian version of the statement)... and the English version said "the B-29 returned to the airport and landed."      Based on the facts as presented, would YOU have signed that statement? Did the pilot land the plane or did it crash land?

People have to break out of some of the ideological rigidity and gridlock that we've been carrying around for too long."

20090203124056AABfJIS	Politics & Government;Elections	Will Obama be able to fix the fall out of the inflation bubble with the buy American plan?	Why did buying decrease? Credit implosion.   Why did the credit go bad? Bad credit standards.   What did they buy? Outsourcing.   Where is are industry that can rebuild our economy? China.      In the last 15 years imports have roase 1500% while exports dropped 1100%.The credit debt of Americans has increased along the same lines as there are fewer dollars from GDP going to workers. This meant consumption went up and industry went down. This could be compared to a poor man with balloon loan except it was the retail Business buying jets and outsourcing customers at the same time.      When you send more then half of your growth to another country it balloons faster then a bad loan. When it fills to much with inflation and credit debt it pops. Then you have no industry, the retailer have a smaller customer base, and the banks have more debt then equity.      The only solution that works is to rebuild what every enemy in the world fears American industry and are workers so much better that when even threaten it the crooks around the world scream in fear.      We need to tax non American made goods in stores to make the consumer not want to buy them.      There American made products but the unfair big imports gangsters want to kill are working class.

20090203123018AAc2nvq	Politics & Government;Elections	If Obama's "57 states" remark is one of his most serious gaffes, doesn't this mean Obama makes few mistakes?	Here is what Obama said:    "It is wonderful to be back in Oregon.  Over the last 15 months, weve traveled to every corner of the United States. Ive now been in 57 states? I think one left to go. Alaska and Hawaii, I was not allowed to go to even though I really wanted to visit, but my staff would not justify it."     It's obvious that Obama meant to say "47" not "57" states.  That is, 48 continental United States minus the one he had not yet visited.  And he was cracking a joke.      Later the same day, Obama apologized and joked about his "innumeracy."    This purported gaffe was committed May 9, 2008.  Since then, Obama's opponents continue to refer to this as one of his great mistakes.    My question is:  If this is the one of the biggest gaffe's Obama's opponents can cite, then doesn't that in fact speak very favorably of Obama?

When we split last year in March, I had him sign a letter saying my son and I, with my mother in law travelling together to Canada so that I could work and live there. The proposed length of stay would be 3 months. My mother in law returned to the US. My son has been staying with me in Canada for almost a year. I had not followed up with his immigration status. On his passport there was a visitor status stamp on it, for only three months. My husband is hard to find and track down. Let's say I could not find my husband to approve my son to become a Canadian citizen, what can I do?   I am not allowed to return to the US because I overstayed.

20090220040500AAW8qWm	Politics & Government;Politics	Does this pretty well sum up our current situation in America?	Professor Joseph Olson of Hemline University School of Law,   St. Paul,  Minnesota, points out facts of 2008 Presidential   election:      Number of States won by:   Democrats: 19   Republicans:  29      Square miles of land won by:   Democrats: 580,000   Republicans:  2,427,000      Population of counties won by:   Democrats: 127 million   Republicans: 143 million      Murder rate per 100,000 residents in counties won by:   Democrats: 13.2   Republicans:  2.1      Professor Olson adds:   "In aggregate, the map of the territory Republican won by   Republicans was  mostly the land owned by the taxpaying citizens of   the country."      Democrat territory mostly encompassed those citizens living   in government-owned tenements and living off various forms of   government welfare.      Professor Olson believes the United States is now somewhere   between the "complacency and apathy" phase of Professor Tyler's   definition of democracy, with some forty percent of the nation's   population already having reached the "governmental dependency" phase.      If Congress grants amnesty and citizenship to twenty million  criminal   invaders called illegal's and they vote, then we can say goodbye to   the USA in fewer than five years

You go to your GP to get a free pregnancy test and find out to your horror your pregnant.   You can't keep of the smack.  Prostitution is the only way to sustain yourself.   You get hammered all the time.   When your child is born it is brought up in that world.

This part and the CRA do not require    a bank to make loans or investments or to provide services that are    inconsistent with safe and sound operations. To the contrary, the Board anticipates banks can meet the standards of this part with safe and sound loans, investments, and services on which the banks expect to make a profit. Banks are permitted and encouraged to develop and apply flexible underwriting standards for loans that benefit low- or moderate-income geographies or individuals, only if consistent with safe and sound operations.

Who decides on the construction of a speed breaker out of the blue on the main /arterial roads . They  in my considered view , are the causes for more than 80 % of the road accidents in India . 10 % accidents are for the cows and the grand bulls left loose on the roads .The remaining five percent are for the pot holes , open septic tanks etc etc over looked by the spoiled brats .   Coming back to the question- are these speed breakers at all necessary . Will the people responsible for making the life of the vehicles as well as the drivers /passengers of the vehicles speak out with statistics to defend their action.   Speed breakers cost the exchequers dear. That money can be flowed back to the govt for providing more staff for the offfices of CIC /SIC  to save RTI movement in India.   I consider speed breakers do not help the civic society in any manner . It does not prevent accidents but are the root causes of the accidents .Can there be a rally to remove all speed breakers on the indian roads . This will create jobs and boost our economy as well    Speed Breakers are our enemy No 1 to all inclusive progress. Let's ban construction of any speedbreaker in any road.

They will make us slaves to money and put microchips in us.  They will starve us and inject us will chemicals like fluoride in water and mercury in flu shots, in order to dumb us down.  They control the media and lie to us constantly.  They own the public schooling system and purposely teach us nothing, unless it's propaganda.  All we have to do is seperate the states from the federal government but I have the feeling that everybody will give in to them.  They lie about global warming in order to start a carbon tax, and get rid of meats like from cattle because it supposedly causes carbon dioxide.  The sun is warming the planet, not CO2.  Wake up people!  and yes, the queen does have power.  She picks the prime minister and also has the power to remove him, thus he does whatever she says.

20090220050630AAflmfr	Politics & Government;Politics	Is Obama soft on terrorism?	OBAMA AWOL IN TERROR WAR      By DICK MORRIS & EILEEN MCGANN      Published on DickMorris.com on February 19, 2009      President Barack Obama's record in battling terrorism has proven so weak that one wonders if he really takes the issue seriously.      Since he has taken office, the president has:      ? Announced closure of Guantanamo.      ? Declined to prosecute the mastermind behind the USS Cole bombing.      ? Closed all overseas CIA interrogation centers.      ? Appointed an Attorney General and Justice Department officials on record as opposed to the use of "enhanced" interrogation techniques in terror investigations.      ? Granted Al Arabia television his first news organization interview and called Fatah Party leader and PA President Mahmoud Abbass in his first phone contact with any foreign leader.      Now, with no strings attached, the president has allocated $20.3 million in "post-conflict humanitarian aid" to "Palestinian refugees and conflict victims in Gaza.  The additional funds bring to $60 million U.S. aid commitments in Gaza.      Of course, Gaza is totally controlled by the terrorist group Hamas which grabs any aid that arrives and uses it for its own purposes.  In fact, on February 7th, the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) - the body charged with distributing the new U.S. aid - announced that it was suspending assistance in Gaza because ten lorries, laden with humanitarian supplies, were seized by Hamas members.  It was the second time that week that Hamas has stolen aid destined for the UNRWA.       Christopher Gunness, a UNRWA spokesman, told Al Jazeera that UN aid shipments would not restart until the goods were returned.  "Until we get all of this aid back, and until we receive credible assurances from the Hamas government, the suspension of our imports of aid into Gaza will continue, he said."      Responding to the obvious low profile Obama is giving his battle against terrorism, two key nations - one an adversary and the other an ally - both acted to aid al Qaeda in the days after Obama's inauguration.  Neither got so much as a verbal a slap on the wrist from the new Administration.      The Associated Press reported, on February 8th, that Yemen, which boasts of having a "truce" with al Qaeda, "released 170 men it had arrested on suspicion of having ties to al Qaeda."  The announcement came "two weeks after [al Qaeda] announced that Yemen had become the base of its activities for the whole Arabian Peninsula."      Yemen has also made it clear that it expects most of the 100 remaining Yemenis at Guantanamo (out of the 250 inmates still there) to be sent home after Obama orders the prison shut.       And, Pakistan, a supposed ally, has just concluded a deal with the Taliban ceding to its control an area on the Afghan/Paki border which its troops had, unsuccessfully, tried to capture.  The Taliban now has the same deal it had in Afghanistan - a protected sanctuary from which to launch raids on the West.  In view of the Administration's passive acquiescence in the Paki decision, one is driven to ask why do we still care about freedom in Afghanistan?      On all fronts, the message from Obama is the same - surrender, pullback, and weakness.  It is a matter of time until al Qaeda and other terrorists walk through the door he and his appointees are holding open and hit us again.         My answer is yes.

Obama has said that things are at crisis levels even though there have been repeated news articles that this recession is not as bad as in the 1980's or at the great depression levels.        Obama's doom and gloom speech is scaring people and corporations, therefore things will continue to get worse.  Why can't he say something positive about the economy?        At least when McCain said "the fundamentals of the economy is strong", he was talking positive about a bad situation.  Why can't Obama do that?

Bush did his fair share of 'wasteful spending' over his tenure.   The difference was that he started out with a surplus and it's easy to spend money you already have.    He even spent to the point where a surplus became a deficit, with nothing to show for it.   Yet, terms like 'wasteful spending' & 'passing on debt to future generations' seemed to be screamed since Obama has been in office.      So, why the inconsistency?      Thoughts?

Although I didn't vote for Obama, I will admit that it was nice to see so many people filled with hope about all the "change" that Obama promised.  But now that the buzz has worn off and the hangover is starting to set in, are you willing to face REALITY?       Because the REALITY is that the people who actually have money invested in our system just don't share your optimism.  Despite Obama's $787 BILLION stimulus package, the dow fell to to a 6-year low of 7334.  Just to give you a comparison (for those that were old enough to remember) this rivals the level after the 911 attacks.        So unless you know something that investors don't, are you willing to admit that it's a very real possibility that Obama just flushed $787 billion down the toilet?

We simply cannot afford it"         Dayton, OH, Oct 9th, 2008   "We have to act to fix our broken economy and restore the credit markets.  But TAXPAYERS SHOULDN'T BE ASKED TO PICK UP THE TAB FOR THE THE VERY FOLKS WHO  HELPED CREATE THIS CRISIS."

I know for at least 2 jobs in my life,I have had to be drug tested.Which is no problem for me because I do not do drugs !   I worked for a school and they did a back ground check and a drug test.I agree with this because you are working around children.   I worked for a large format printing company.They do a drug test.      So why do people who collect a welfare check,which IS government money,NOT have to be randomly drug tested? Or how about a back ground check??      In obama's big "stimulus package"  he is handing out more food stamps and more money to welfare recipients.      I do not have a problem with people getting help when the need is there,let me make that clear.   But welfare is supposed to be a "stepping stone" to give certain people a "helping hand" but you and I ALL know that some people "make a living" on welfare. I think the government should randomly drug test and do back ground checks for welfare "workers" .

20090220045811AA5EtcZ	Politics & Government;Politics	Won't the government requiring oil company crooks to lower their prices the only solution to save the economy?	The economy started to go bad as oil prices started to go up. As a result the US oil companies such as Shell have made the biggest profits in history of any company year after year since the Bush administration. The exact amount oil went up is the exact amount by which their profits increased. So due to this gauging, isn't it simple like a kindergardener would be able to see what the problem/solution is instead of blaming everything else and throwing money left and right at useless people. Car companies suffered due to higher fuel prices which caused inflation. Everything stems from oil so why doesn't the government put laws to prevent oil gauging instead of the consequences, such as housing etc which are a result of the fuel prices having gone up higher than the combined total in the history since we've had fuel itself, all in a matter of the past few years.

Summary: Lou Dobbs falsely claimed that the economic recovery bill, which the House recently passed, "would allow people who don't have Social Security numbers to be eligible" for the bill's Making Work Pay tax credits and would therefore make undocumented immigrants "eligible for checks." In fact, illegal immigrants without Social Security numbers are not eligible for tax credits under the stimulus bill.

20090220061842AAmgBYm	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can an illegal immigrant file charges in the United States?	I have a really big problem. About two months ago, a Honduran immigrant held my computer hostage because she thought I had something of hers. The computer is worth around $1000. People kept telling me to cut my losses and back off, but not this one. I need the money.      So I followed some advice on Yahoo answers and from my friends...the police refused to help me. Three times. I was advised by multiple people to "threaten" her, to make returning my stuff worth her while.         Well, here's the kicker.       I went along with that suggestion and she CALLED MY MOM. Telling her that "[I] threatened her kids." She has two boys.      I left the first message giving her a deadline; drop my computer off at the university library, or I would slap her with a court order.      The second message said that if she didn't return it, I would notify the INS.      The problem is this. I am involved in politics, and if this story that I threatened kids gets out, I'm done for. Quite possibly it could question the campaign and we would be screwed.      If this story breaks, the newspapers might report on it. I left messages on her cell phone; they can trace it to me immediately.      Now, if she wants to file charges, as an illegal it is my understanding that since she DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A GREEN CARD, or a driver's license, then she couldn't make it very far in the American court system. My mom, on the other hand, says that even illegals have a right to be protected.      Generally, my question is this: Can she "sue" me/file charges? If so, then I am really screwed.

I have read countless answers to questions today that said that Republicans are just mad because they "lost" and Obama is doing just fine.  So I thought I would ask how many people have lost their jobs since Obama was elected?  How many people are actually doing better now?  I'm pretty much the same for now but the industry that I work in has taken a pretty big hit and it doesn't seem to be getting better.

What are the less fortunate to do?	i work 2 jobs; cell phone agent and personal fitness trainer.      i live in a small town that has one of the highest unemployment rates in all of Virginia. there are store/maunfacturing/business closings or layoffs nearly every week.      most of my friends have recently been laid off (i'm not exaggerating) and things are just looking very gloomy.      so groceries are going up... electric is going up... gas goes up sporadically... it seems like everything is going up except the paychecks (for those of us lucky enough to have a job).      i have lost alot of my personal training clients due to these job losses and there has been alot of people cancelling their cell phone service also due to these job losses (putting me at risk of losing my job as well).      i have even completely turned off my heat because i can't afford to heat my very small apartment.      i live alone and trying to make it but sometimes i feel it would be easier to just curl up and die.      i feel such doom and gloom i don't even want to live anymore because it's just a miserable feeling not to be able to live comfortably when you are very physically and mentally ABLE to work and very WILLING to work but just CAN'T FIND enough work.      am i alone or does anyone feel as miserable about our economic status as i do?

Okay so my former employer waited right up until the deadline to finish the W2 (so she won't get in trouble).Then she waited like another week to send them out. I had two jobs and I got my W2 for one of them but I am currently waiting for hers so I can file both my taxes at the same time. I've been talking to one of my former co-workers who worked with me at that place and she was telling me that my former boss has been trying to get in contact with me for a long time. That ticked me off because the co-worker who I've been talking to first said that when the W2's were sent out, she would get mine too and give it to me directly. She didn't even tell me they were sent out! And on top of that I'm mad because she could have easily given my former employer my number so she could contact me. Finally I called my former boss and told her my updated information and she said she'd mail it out that day. I haven't gotten it yet and it's been over a week. I don't want to sue her because her business got shut down so I know she isn't making money, but at the same time we stay in the same city so I should have gotten it by now!      Also, this lady is sneaky, she lies, and she manipulates just about anyone or anything...I honestly believe she isn't trying to give me my money and I've run out of patience.

This is to help out the MIDDLE CLASS not POOR people who do not  to work or pay their bills, I am sure the majority of people on this site are MIDDLE CLASS not just seriously rich...keep in mind that when we as tax payers pay city taxes the cities downtown is usually full of really nice office buildings but they do not always help their citizens in everyway possible but we as citizens still have to pay our taxes to pay their bill...basically this is the same as stimulous...the only reason everyone is so aware of it now is because more people are starting to pay more attention..,thanks to our New President Barack Obama... again everyone just keep watching

I can understand the military's expectations for having troops who must be dependable.  And, how it is associated with a certain age range... yet that does not put everyone outside of the required age range as not dependable or better qualified.  There are many men, more than is known who are much more qualified than their younger recruits who meet qualifications - who would join the military... but age is an issue.  Not everyone is able to do so do to other obligations such as family and what not, but these are VOLUNTEERS.  If they have what is take physically... God knows they already have the mental edge compared to a 17-18 year old.  I don't see why the military wouldn't want these highly MOTIVATED individuals who want in the military and are past the cut-off ages.  Why would THESE volunteers be turned down.  I think this is a huge mistake - these are the exact type of guys that make a good military man.  All they want to do is serve their country and i think it is a big mistake not to let them in.

So is there like a common battle between the NCO and the officers?       I mean I have no intentions in making enemies. I just want to have everyone back and learn as much as I can and be close friends and support my own troops. I most likely be looking for the Master sergeants for questions and needing support from them since they are more experieneced then I.

CNBC editor Rick Santelli let it rip on-air Thursday, leading a "mob" of Chicago traders in a mini-revolt against the government's mortgage bailout plan.      Gesticulating and shouting as cheers and boos erupted, Santelli called foreclosed homeowners "losers" and called for a Revolutionary War-style "tea party."      "The government is promoting bad behavior," Santelli said of President Obama's $75 billion initiative to refinance mortgages.      "I have an idea," he said on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange floor.      "How about this, new President and new administration, why don't you put up a Web site to have people vote on the Internet ... to see if we really want to subsidize the losers' mortgages.      "Or would we like to at least buy cars and buy houses in foreclosure and give them to people who might have a chance to actually prosper down the road... reward people who could carry the water instead of drink the water."      Santelli then turned to the traders.      "How many of you people want to pay for your neighbor's mortgage that has an extra bathroom and can't pay their bills?" he asked as boos filled the air.      "President Obama," Santelli continued. "Are you listening?"

20090220065955AAZYDdP	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Is it possible to disprove hearsay lies that are said against me in court by witnesses? What should I do?	Three witnesses recently lied against me in court while under oath, saying that I said at Thanksgiving dinner on 2008 that because I am under psychiatric care I can lie and say whatever I want and get away with it. The court commissioner accepted that statement as credible, and when I rebutted by saying that I do not recall having ever made that statement, he said that the fact that I made that statement threw doubt on the rest of my testimony. Basically, it caused my testimony to be discredited.      I am not under psychiatric care, and also was not in November of 2008, and I have the medical records to prove it. But, I have had an awful time trying to prove that I did not make the alleged statement during the Thanksgiving dinner.      Is it possible to disprove this hearsay? Is this discrimination based on a disability that I do not have? Is hearsay supposed to be accepted as evidence in a district court? Might this be grounds for disciplinary action against the court commissioner?      I am planning to re-file for the domestic violence protection order that I was denied based in large part on the lies of the defendant and the three witnesses from his immediate family (his mother and two sisters).

I asked this question earlier this morning.  Why are democrats blaming the banks because someone who borrowed money didn't pay them back?      Dems - If someone borrows $1,000 dollars from you and doesn't pay you back.  Would you say:      A: Its OK.  Forget about it   B: Punch them in the nose and say give me the money   C: Take the to small claims court and have a judge force them to pay you.  If they don't obey the judge, have the sheriff start seizing property and sell it until you get your money back?    D: the person says that they didn't understand the terms of the loan so therefore they should not have to pay you back.  Then you forget about it and go to the government to see if they will pay you back.        I would say B and C should be the correct answers.  But this will be interesting reading.

20090220051637AApXEwc	Politics & Government;Government	Bush gives billions for Katrina victims, gets spit on, Obama give s jack, that's okay?	The economic stimulus signed by President Barack Obama will spread billions of dollars across the country to spruce up aging roads and bridges. But there's not a dime specifically dedicated to fixing leftover damage from Hurricane Katrina.      And there's no outrage about it.      Democrats who routinely criticized President George W. Bush for not sending more money to the Gulf Coast appear to be giving Obama the benefit of the doubt in his first major spending initiative. Even the Gulf's fiercest advocates say they're happy with the stimulus package, and their states have enough money for now to address their needs.      "I'm not saying there won't be a need in the future, but right now the focus is not on more money, it's on using what we have," said Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., who has criticized Democrats and Republicans alike over Katrina funding.      It's a significant change in tone from the Bush years, when any perceived slight of Katrina victims was met with charges that the Republican president who bungled the initial response to the disaster continued to callously ignore the Gulf's needs years later.      Just last summer, Democrats accused Bush of putting Iraq before New Orleans when he sought to block Gulf Coast reconstruction money from a $162 billion war spending bill. Bush was pilloried for not mentioning the disaster in back-to-back State of the Union addresses.      Former Rep. Jim McCrery, R-La., who helped lead the fight for Gulf aid before retiring last year, said he was surprised over the lack of Katrina money in the bill, but figures lawmakers may be granting Obama leniency due to the magnitude of the country's current economic challenges.

Since the elections it seems like some people have resorted to extreme generalizing here on Yahoo! Answers.  Anyone else notice this?  Its kinda ridiculous.  Democrats assume all Republicans and rich white guys that are only acting in their own interest for their party and are only out to make more money.  And Vice Versa Republicans think all Democrats are Lazy, Crooks all about spending money and taking the wealthy's money for themselves.  They assume all Democrats suck blood from government welfare benefits and try to get everything they can by doing nothing.

Do you really trust a guy who constantly has to explain that he is "not against the 2nd amendment".      For me, just the fact that he feels the need to remind us that he is not against the 2nd amendment is a big red flag and is really suspicious.      People who are genuinely for the 2nd amendment don't have to constantly defend themselves by saying they are not against it. You would have never heard Charlton Heston say that he was not against the 2nd amendment.      Private firearm ownership is the prerequisite for a free nation and by grabbing guns, Obama grabs more than firearms, he will grab our freedom.

20090220054419AASd6kg	Politics & Government;Elections	Did Obama's aunt SIGN UP for her tax CREDIT as an UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT?	Part of the economic stimulus bill that was just passed by the House (except for House Republicans and 11 Democrats who voted against it), includes “tax credits” of $500 per person and $1,000 per couple. (Note: if the recipients pay no taxes, it’s not a credit, it’s a handout.) Apparently the wording specifically disqualifies “nonresident aliens” – Washington-speak for illegals – people with no Social Security numbers could still get the cashola:      Undocumented immigrants [liberal reporter-speak for illegals] who are not eligible for a Social Security number can file tax returns with an alternative number. A House-passed version of the economic recovery bill and one making its way through the Senate would allow anyone with such a number, called an individual taxpayer identification number, to qualify for the tax credits.

I dont understand why Canada would be concerned that we might want to stop trading with them if the things we get from them or them from us are things that are needed in both countries due to scarcity.      Besides the obvious argument that no one really wants to curtail trade or be a protectionist, are there more selfish motives from Canada's point of view why they would want to make sure NAFTA survives just as it it is ..in its current form?      I could more understand why Mexico would be concerned, because the sort of trade that we do with them is mostly for things that we  really do not need or cannot produce ourselves.   They are mostly produced there so that corporations can do an end run around U.S. labor and then reimport the goods back to USA to sell to americans. Now that sort of trade I have a problem with as its working against the economic livelihood of american citizens.  But if we are imporing things like oil or other things that are really scarce in the USA from Canada, then I don't think anyone is going to say, lets not bring in oil anymore from Canada.      I just wish there was more honesty when people talked about these trade policies. I always feel like there are coded messages being sent and that someone is winking and nodding and trying to pull the wool over the eyes of americans.

20090220070036AAG2fd3	Politics & Government;Politics	Republicans: A question about Obama?	OK, I have been trying to figure this out for awhile, and I can't figure out if you guys just "don't get it", or if you're just trying to cause a disturbance. Maybe you can help.      We voted for Obama. We knew why we voted for him. We (most of us anyway) did not vote for him because he was black, or because of our 'emotional high". We studyed the issues, and decided he was the best man for the job.   Does this really suprise you? Are you that stubborn, to think that no one could possibly disagree with you? I WANT universal health care. I WANT higher taxes on the wealthy. I did a ton of research on these 2 things, and more, and decided that, in my opinion, the benefits outweighed the downsides. You obviously disagree.      But my point is: Why do I constantly here on this site "Look what Obama has done. Are you upset you voted for him yet?"      Of course I am not upset I voted for him. He is doing EXACTLY what I wanted him to do when I voted for him. Maybe he isn't doing what YOU want him to do, but then again, that's why you didn't vote for him, isn't it?      Does this clear things up? I just want you guys to know how stupid these questions look to the rest of us. I know most of you are very intelligent, so please act like it.

20090220070125AAfeKjA	Politics & Government;Immigration	Is qualifying ones' stance on immigration with the words "I'm not a racist but ...."?	...just playing into the hands of the Thought Police?   I ask this because I actually catch myself leaning that way sometimes. But why? Why should one need to justify or excuse or explain a position that is actually fairly self explanatory and is in no way, of itself, indicative of a bigoted dislike of foreigners? Okay, so I disagree with the UK governments' open door policy for all European migrant workers, and I'm deeply resentful that so many illegal immigrants manage to get in to this country and stay here. Now, I don't think that necessarily marks me out as a racist - but if other people feel it does then so what?. Why should I care if someone  hangs that hackneyed old label on me - it's not like "paedophile" or "murderer", after all! However, these days it seems we're all supposed to regard the term "racist" as being the vilest possible thing a person can be accused of  - and hence, if you're not mindful, you can find yourself going through agonised contortions to avoid the dreaded R word being slapped on your forehead in big red letters.   It's actually quite insidious and has become a very effective way of silencing a lot of people whose opinions are neither extreme nor offensive but simply do not tally with the governmental position.    Anyway, what d'you think?
