I need a family plan for me an my bro (two phones/lines in total). I had a track phone before but i don't like them because they have bad reseption in the areas i live in and as you all know they aren't the best things to look at.

I know that some people custimize there plan to fit there need and money is taken off or added to they monthly bill, but i need the most basic and cheapest plan you can get. I also need to phones (no more than $100). Me and my bro want "quick text" phones with the key boards that ether slide out or the screen moves to show the keypad.

20090202132104AAgiycW	Consumer Electronics;Land Phones	I keep getting weird calls?	Ok, so, I started getting them on New Year's Eve. They call everyday, and on some days, they call non-stop. They're from many, many, many different companies and numbers. So, in the beginning they asked for someone named "Bob Smith", which you can pass as a fictitious name, so I thought they were prank calls and would stop eventually. But they never did. I asked one of the callers for the IP address from who was signing up for the company's service.(Whoever it was, they were putting my phone number on a TON of different websites and those people can't stop calling me.) They said they signed up online, too. The IP address was located in my city and I was actually able to track down the exact (or close to exact) address.       On the applications the person signed up on they put an address right across the street from one of my friend's houses (making me think it could be my friend doing this to me.) And they put their email as "mileycyrus@hotmail.com" which I'm also sure is fake.       Now I also get calls for someone asking for someone named Karen and it is the same thing happening. I got like 10 Karen calls within 10 minutes, seriously. My phone has like been spammed for the past month...Should I take this to the police? Should I confront the people I think are doing it? What should i do

LCD TV      lcd tv has no burn in problems but has a response time higher than a plasma. so does it lag when playing fast moving games.?? and lcd has a picture quality slightly less than a plasma tv.

The same goes if they take the battery away as well.  Disrupting the teacher wastes time for the entire class, so I'm wondering if these jammers are being implemented to prevent texting and calling during/between classes instead of the original method of dealing with cell phone disruption.      Average devices have a range up to 150 feet, so many would be needed for larger schools.  Do you think they help you focus during class instead of waiting for that message about from your friends?

20070105080149AADMGpP	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	Whats the difference with these watch batteries? which one should i get?	ok, here's the deal: i got a watch from wilson's leather about 4 years ago and the battery finally died. i dont have the little papers that tell me which battery i need, and when i opened up the watch and got the old battery out, it went flying away never to be found. at the store theres some energizer watch batteries that seem to be the right size, and they're all either 1.5v or 1.55v batteries (i cant imagine that it would matter which i get), but they have other numbers on them too, one says 377, one says 392, etc. what one do i need? or does it even matter? they're all the same price btw.
