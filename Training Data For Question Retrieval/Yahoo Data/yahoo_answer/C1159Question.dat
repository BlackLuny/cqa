20090307032449AAVNmYU	Beauty & Style;Makeup	What is your answer to this question related to makeup ?	Imagine a situation where a Man in his mid-twenties is looking for a bride for himself. He is shown photographs of ten girls, from which he selects one photograph of Suzanne which he finds to be the most beautiful among those ten. He is then further shown four photographs of the same girl he selected, each of the four photos representing four different facial expressions of Suzanne. In the first photograph, Suzanne is in an angry mood with a frown on her face. In the second photograph, Suzanne is giving is in a tension mode with sweat all over her face and a fear. In the third photograph, Suzanne is looking bored. In the fourth photograph, Suzanne is smiling confidently. The boy is asked to select now from among those four photos of Suzanne. He selects the photograph in which Suzanne is smiling confidently.       Can Body Confidence really make a man indifferent to the fact that the girl is without any make up or do they complement each other in some ways ?
20090307030000AAyRaHm	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Don't you have reasons to be happy about the way you look after reading this ?	The mirror serves an important purpose of helping us to condition ourselves and groom ourselves be it the way we look, our hair, our clothes, etc. We can look into the mirror whenever we feel the need to wherever we are, thanks to the modern handy designs. But, does it truly display us our real look which the world sees of us. Haven’t you found your photographs different from your mirror image? Just for an experiment, write anything on a piece of paper in any language and take it in front of the mirror. What do you see? Yes, you found that the writing appears reverse. This is what exactly happens with your image in the mirror. Your right becomes your left and vice versa. Thus, if you have your nose slightly tilted towards the left, your mirror image will show it to be towards your right. Surprisingly, you will always find your mirror image better than your photographs. But, ask anyone around and they will tell you that you look better in the photograph than in your mirror image. Why is it so that despite the fact, that our photographs are showing us our real image, we still like our mirror image more appealing and better? I think it has more to do with being used to an image. Since we cannot see ourselves, we have grown up looking at the mirror and the world has always seen more of our real image than our mirror image. I think that is what creates the difference. So next time when you look into the mirror, remember “THIS IS NOT HOW YOU LOOK”. If you want to see how you really look, ask someone to photograph you and there you get to see your real image. What are your opinions on this ?

I went from dirty blonde, to platinum blonde, to brown, to platinum blonde with black underneath, to blue, to blonde, to brown/black and now its blonde agian.   Yeaaahhh, pretty stupid thing to do..... no need to tell me.   Anywho its so fried and and feels like hay.   I got it cut about 2 months ago, but i really don't want to cut anymore off because i'm trying to grow it long.   I've tried extra virgin olive oil, mayonnaise, aussie 3 minutes miracle, Paul Mitchell super strong treatment, and V05 hot oil treatment, and pantene pro-v deep fortifying treatment.   None of it has really made that much of a difference.   My hair is extremely hard to manage only thing i can do to it is leave it down. Its fried off in some spots really short, I have split ends all the way up to the top of my head. My hair is so poofy and gross   It looks so horrible.

Also, we'll be having dinner on a cruise ship and it's 'semi-formal', but they said it's acceptable to wear sneakers. I have white converse high-tops that I really like, so could you suggest a skirt or dress that would look nice with those? And the next day, we'll be going to a Broadway play.

'I fingerweave friendship bracelets of a different sort. Mine come out round, more or less, using 5 loops. You start with 5 strands of embroidery thread (or whatever type of string/cord you want) about 31" in length for a bracelet. (if I remember correctly; it's been a long time, and I usually measure from my thumb and forefinger to the soft area just inside my shoulder) Then you double them all together and tie them at loose end.       You use a safety pin which you have poked through the knot to anchor the strands to your jeans or a towel or some other thick fabric that will take some yanking on, and then you loop 3 strands over the index, second, and third fingers of one hand (let's say the R) and 2 strands over the index and second fingers of the other hand (L).       Now you use the 3rd finger of your left hand and pass it under the upper half of the loops you are holding on your 3rd and 2nd fingers (in that order) on the R hand and then hook it *

I want to have one on my foot, by the heel. I'm wondering how much this will hurt.       Also, how likely will it be that the area will become infected, since I heard it's best to get one where it won't be rubbed against something. I heard people say I should get it in the summer, since I could wear flip flops and the tattoo can "breathe". But I'm worried that it might get dirty since of all the dirt when walking on the streets.      Thank you for your time and answers!       P.S.: I'm think of getting a pretty small tattoo, nothing bigger than an inch.

I've heard it's a fungus infection.        Once a patch that took up one fourth of my toenail was,like, not connected to the rest of my nail and it was a yellowish/ brownish color underneath.  I scraped out the underside of it and then cut off that part of the nail.  The patch of color hasn't come back but the ridges are still there.        So, how do I get rid of it.  I'm going to the mall today.  Are there any products that will help?

20090307072940AAxc7hQ	Beauty & Style;Makeup	Before refilling on my Bare Minerals, should I try a Mac foundation? I need a lot of help?	I've been happily using Bare Minerals for over a year now. I just ran out of my foundation yesterday & feel like I want to try something else. Everyone raves about most Mac products. I figure if I'm already spending a pretty riddiculous amount of money on face makeup, why not spend a bit more & try out Mac? Now, my question is, is it worth it?      I have fairly dry, sensitive skin I get a pimple or two every 2 weeks or so. My cheeks, nose & chin area are generally very red so I'd like something that covers the imperfections up. I can't stand anything more than a chalky looking face or when it actually feels like I have makeup on my skin. I haven't had the best experiences with Liquid Foundation, but I'm willing to give it a try. I'd prefer powder though.      Any suggestions on what Mac products might work best for what I've described?

I guess I was kind of rude to her roommate and 4 friends. They had a lot of fun at my expense. They grabbed me and forced a dress over my head, tied me up with a pair of panythose and a bathrobe sash and they gave me a makeover and painted my nails. They took a ton of pictures. They've offered to destroy the pictures if I go over this weekend and model some clothes and cooperate completely. I was told I'd have to come alone and be extremely agreeable. I really want to destroy those pictures before any of my friends see them. Should I go over this weekend and agree in exchange for the pics they took? I think they plan to take more pics, but at least they wouldn't be as embarrassing. Is this a trap?  They made a joke about me being only 20, but having a forever 21 dress that they can't wait to see me in.  I take it this is a store and not a style?
