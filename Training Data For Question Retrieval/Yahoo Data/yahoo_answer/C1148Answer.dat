ZY2GT7edaa	personally, i think that prom dresses should be long not short. so i would chose the longer dress. however, is this dress the one on the celebrity or the one that is on the images below? because i like the images below much better. i think it would also look nice with your hair! you should also consider a deep saphire color...jewel tones look good on red haired people...oo and deep velvet purple color is nice........not the velvet part it just sounded good.|`|MFKgVsoAaa	well i really like the second one because it's so elegant, but if you're on the shorter side, i'd have to go with the first! by the way, the dark green color would look beautiful with your red hair! but you probably already know that if those are the dresses you're going for lol.|`|a70c9a738ebec9de6530aaa2660bccfbaa	Green goes well with red hair, but I suggest this dress:<br>  <a href="http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3014250/0~2376776~2374327~6022409~6022442?mediumthumbnail=Y&origin=category&searchtype=&pbo=6022442&P=1" rel="nofollow">http://shop.nordstrom.com/S/3014250/0~23...</a><br>  If I had to pick between the two you gave, I'd go with the second one.<br>  Good luck and have a great prom!|`|TMkHzArLaa	the first one :D <br>  its sooo cute and it would great on you since your kinda short<br>  I love it! <br>  It will be easy to dance and sit in<br>  the others too long and i dont liek the color<br>  HAVE FUN!!!!|`|axheoEN4aa	1st one =]

1EoTIZl8aa	Maybe go to a stylist for that day. I think some foundation to make your face look nice at prom would be good. And I think dark eyeliner and mascara.... Maybe pink gloss for the lips.You're pretty already, so I'm not sure if you need much. ^^|`|R848tHVDaa	go to a salon or go to a makeup store (any makeup store -- sephora, mac, lancome, clinic) and ask if they can help you come up with a makeup look for prom. you should do it way before prom, like 1-2 weeks before, that way you can see if you like it or not. and if you do like the look, then buy it or set an appointment on prom day so they can do it for you.<br>  <br>  make sure you tell them your dress color. you wouldn't want to have pink eyeshadows when your dress is blue.|`|mo8OfKjeaa	go to a salon.<br>  get all your pores cleaned out, and then, the stylist will apply nice foundation on your skin. i would say try some blush, mascara, colourful eyeliner, and bright pink or peach lipgloss.
2rwU2KvPaa	To scrunch my hair, i wet it, then i use treseme curl hydration. after that i use mousse. That's it! Because you have straight hair, it may not look that curly but i'm sure it will still look good!<br>  <br>  Hope that helped! : )|`|jGqZdS2xaa	Ok, first of all you need to buy some mousse. I prefer Herbal Essences Body Envy Mousse. It works amazingly well and it will definitely work for you. When you get out of the shower, apply mousse from roots to ends. Then scrunch your hair. If you don't know how to scrunch it then go on You Tube and type in "How to scrunch your hair" and videos will pop up that will really help. You cannot explain it with words. You can blow dry it on a low setting or you can let it air dry.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps! <3|`|CEn5w8mxaa	you have to wet it then put hairspray and gel in yur hair

I sue Dinair Airbrush makeup. Its amazing! Its a little more pricey when you first start out but TOTALLY worth it in the end. If you go to google and type in Dinair you'll find their site...hope this helps...=)
GKJV2EBSaa	To have two or more different hair styles this is what you need to do.<br>  To do this with one computer open up two windows.On one of the windows, log in. Go to Meezmaker and click the item you want. Don't press save! Then log in on the other window and again, go to meezmaker and select the other item you want. Now this is the tricky part, you have to press the little square button in the corner at the top, by the minimize button. Drag it to the bigger Meez screen and get both save buttons as close together as possible. Then once it's good enough, press the save buttons as FAST as you can. So it will save both hairstyles.It is very tricky to do so you will have to try it a couple of times.<br>  Hope this helps you!
gYLkvAnjaa	Everyone has hair at the back of their neck.  It's normal. The more you try to get rid of it, the more attention you will bring to that area.  Don't worry about it.  It's normal and completely natural.  If it bothers you, leave your hair down..... no one will be able to see it.|`|p0fqV7BDaa	I would wax that if I were you!
eN5xA6RKaa	yes. read the whole page, under all the piercings it says you and your mother have to be there and both present identification.<br>  yes you are older than the minimum age you have to be to get one, but you are still a minor so you still have to have a parent there with id.|`|hvIMKEH0aa	i don't think so.|`|T4aG8j95aa	you can have her show id or you can bring in a notarized permission note from her if you are 14-17.
5R0MdDENaa	yea i would either wear the necklace and the ring or the earrings and the ring. <br>  <br>  but all three at the same time might look silly.|`|ZY2GT7edaa	less is more. tiffany's is expensive and everyone knows it. if you display all three on you all at once, it does look a bit much and done up. at most, you should wear two at a time. never all three. and yes, it would seem a tad tacky.|`|gAXUpwPraa	sorry, but its tacky to wear 3 of any designer/brand at the same time. they're all super cute, but i would wear one at a time. but..maybe you can pull off the earrings and the ring together. but the necklace by itself, totally. (:|`|p84eexPHaa	yeah sorry, kinda, either wear just the earrings, or just the necklace, or maybe the necklace and ring .|`|p0fqV7BDaa	I think you should stick to just two, if you reeeeally wanna wear more than one.|`|oER5KtH2aa	no but i would only to two at a time like ring with necklace or ring with earrings
dyGcZYQaaa	Not in my book.<br>  ;)
gAXUpwPraa	black/white/silver flats, black uggs, or converse (:|`|MDHEW37saa	maybe some black flats in the spring, summer,and fall. And in winter some pink or black high top converse!|`|p0fqV7BDaa	I would wear cute little ballet flats. Sometimes bright Converse would look good, if you're capable of pulling it off.

vLYGy59Vaa	How bad do you look now?
ddXQeEvNaa	1. Side parts, purple eyeshadow, warm dark brown hair colors  are universally flattering.<br>  2. Replace your perfume with a natural scented oil (made for your body, haha) my favorite is this Jasmine **** I got from Trade Secret. It smells exactly like the flower, because that's what it is. You can wear it on your skin of course, add a few drops into your load of laundry, mix it into your conditioner, and massage it into your scalp. If gives you a light but noticeable scent for at least a full day. I wear a lot of this in the summer.<br>  3. If you're new to or uncomfortable with eyeliner, a thick black line from your inner corner to the outer is usually all you need. It makes your eyes huge, and you don't need to do anything the bottom lash line.<br>  4. Avoid red, white, and light blue shadow/ blush/liner <br>  5. If you want to wear lipstick everyday put on lip balm first, and then one coat of lipstick, and then blot most of it off onto a tissue. It gives you a nice wash of color without making you look like your grandmother. <br>  6.|`|Y5IZdvQNaa	y? u wanna be beautiful?<br>  <br>  hahahahaaha.....=)
yc6YyUwKaa	DEFINITELY!!!! braces are sooooo common now that almost everyone i kno has had them at some point, or will be getting them soon. i have never seen anyone be made fun of for having braces. i had them twice and now my teeth are PERFECT!!! also you can get really cool colors. and when you are an adult, you will have amazingly straight teeth. if i were you, i would get braces for sure! and if you are really that uncomfortable with getting braces, maybe you could just get them on your bottom teeth because then they won't be as noticeable. also you could get invisible braces.|`|f9No4eRBaa	Yes, get them now because the longer you wait, the worse this problem is going to be. Braces are accepted and the norm amongst young teens (I assume you are a young teen). Once they come off in a couple of years, you will have the rest of your life to be happy that you did it.  Your life gets more important as you get older and put this behind you now and not deal with it later.|`|85gJHDbNaa	No one would make fun of you, unless they didn't like you in the first place. In that case, they would just be looking for some way to make you feel bad, which is hella uncool anyways. Get braces, you'll be the happiest person in the world when you get them off and see the results.|`|UBmxjdGkaa	That's easy.<br>  <br>  Okay, think about it this way...<br>  What do you want more... A few years of teasing&a lifetime of gorgeous smiles...OR crooked teeth&and no teasing ( for a few years ).<br>  I'd go for the first choice, come on, a few years for a lifetime, that's a deal you can't pass. <br>  <br>  You may get teasing, but just ignore it. It dies down as people realize braces are one step towards beauty. '<br>  <br>  You can especially get braces for only your bottom teeth too.|`|zO0CFFvCaa	*gasp* people will NOT make fun of you. I had braces for 2 years adn my teeth look great! No one ever made fun of me excpet for my friend who now HAS braces and we call each other tinsel teeth. LOL|`|nI9gXEHxaa	if u want to|`|0mEw8rHMaa	you know, if you're top is fine and you feel really self conscious about it, you could just go for braces on the bottom which can oftentimes be unnoticeable. otherwise, just go for it. it's all worth it in the end and it'll probably take less time than you think. and if you're younger and still in middle/high school, now is the best time to do it.
KH9HROrSaa	honestly nothing, its your body's natural reaction to emotion. don't worry about it, guys think its adorable! but if your really self conscious try clinique redness solutions, its supposed to be pretty affective.<br>  <a href="http://www.clinique.com/templates/products/multiproduct.tmpl?ngextredir=1&CATEGORY_ID=CATEGORY20210" rel="nofollow">http://www.clinique.com/templates/produc...</a>|`|7OjiB7vWaa	well try to not take things in an bad way so you dont embarrassing yourself..and that might help from not blushing|`|Bv3Dm11paa	Become a vampire.

Your cousin is trying to get her money back by scamming you.<br>  <br>  Real MAC brushes always have the number, and usually always have silver ferrules (the metal part that the hair comes out from), not black.<br>  <br>  Don't waste your money. There are other decent quality brushes out there that you can get for 30 bucks. I doubt you'll be able to buy as many, but it won't make a difference if you have more brushes if they're all lousy quality.|`|Yue2YKTnaa	thats not MAC brushes|`|BZKL7qqXaa	no no no sweetie don't buy them! they are fake. if you are a starter i would try and find the new hello kitty brush set. it comes with a three smaller versions/really good starters for beginners and a brush holder. namely the 187 to use on your face for powder or blending, the 109 which works good for blush or foundation application and the 239 eyeshadow brush. the whole thing is $49.50 but is really a bargain since those brushes together would be around 90$ and it comes with a cute holder to top it all off|`|5RjHESqyaa	honey don't purchase them! their absolute fakes!<br>  <br>  just in case you need some suggestions on which REAL mac brushes to get<br>  <br>  #190 or #187 (basic must-have foundation brushes)<br>  #129 or #116 (blush brush)<br>  #266 (for liquid eyeliners)|`|oBvFYIXJaa	those are FAKE MAC brushes...look at the MAC website to see what they look like|`|a1KT2SQlaa	wow so not real mac brushes!

a7ca94e44e190dda67dba7a01a64674aaa	The tooth paste thing is true, it is a lifesaver before a show, trust me.  I model, and I find the best way to walk is while playing music in your head to move your feet to.  I have lately been running The Pussy Cat Doll's , "I Hate This Part" in my head, it works amazingly.  If you're wearing heels, only wear heels this week, if you're wearing flats only wear wear flats.  Do you get it?  Practice is the name of the game!|`|U3E1FCJFaa	my big sister is a high fashion model, and they do this funny thing called TRAINING?!|`|phw4ioR5aa	1. keep ur face clean!! wash it daily!!<br>  <br>  2. walk with confidence!!<br>  <br>  3.  try the cat walk thats wht all model have to do<br>  <br>  4.  i so wish u the best of luck!!!!!|`|S893zUrsaa	I am a clothing designer & have put on shows before with newbie models---first off don't freak out!  Your designer should have any long dresses you are wearing hemmed to a good length so you don't trip on them, it's always classy to hold your dress a little as you walk (try to make it look graceful though!) to prevent tripping too.<br>  'Real' models walk with their toes hitting the ground before their heels, kinda hard to practice if you don't have someone to show you though.  I would say walk naturally, modelling is about attitude and if you relax & act natural you will be fine!<br>  Don't worry about the pimples, there will be so much makeup & light on you they won't even be noticed.|`|zO0CFFvCaa	I heard if you put toothpaste of the pimple it immediatly dries out, Okay, for the walk, just look down before you go down the runway ( to avoid any obstacles if your way) and walk one foot in front of the other, like your walking on a tiperope. You could always practive walking gracefully but walking with a book on your head. Good luck!|`|X5Qzk78maa	stop eating
AfnOU04paa	I prefer the cocoa butter, and have had good luck with it softening my stretch marks.  It also works better for chapped lips than the regular chapstick.  Basically it will take quite some time to minimize the scars with moisturizers, so persevere by using it morning and night.<br>  <br>  Have you thought of trying Mederma?  I haven't tried it, and it is quite expensive, but my girlfriend said she had good luck with scars that were newer.  Hadn't thought of the neosporin.  It's a great product for healing small cuts and sores, so I'd also try that.|`|5GL5AlyMaa	Neosporin is the answer. Dab the neosporin on top of the scar, rub it in and then moisturize as usual. <br>  <br>  I had horrible acne as a child and this is the key to helping them.
3m7diCxPaa	Mine costed about 50$ without the tip.<br>  On a scale of 1 to 10, it was about a 2 or 3. I also have my tragus and nipples pierced, so the nose was nothing to sweat...Just makes your one eye water for about 10 seconds and it's all good, hardly any pain afterwards.<br>  The hole will go away eventually if the jewelry is taken out but it will leave a tiny little scar that will resemble a pore.<br>  By the way, I absolutely love mine, i have a little round stud in it.. so cute :) Do it!!|`|C0HZ8ZB4aa	I don't think it's that bad, I've had mine done twice (healed up the first time). I can't give you a 1-10 because it depends what you're comparing it to. I don't think any piercing is THAT bad because it's over in 5 seconds, I find tattoos much worse because even though the momentary pain isn't so bad with tattoos, the fact that it goes on for ages is what gets me! I had about 30 piercings as a teen (almost all are retired now) and my nose was one of my least painful (the only ones which were any better were ears and belly button). The worst thing about it is it just makes your eye water and stings a bit. Some other piercings you can feel them crunching right through and they're not fun! I think you'll be fine, it's definitely worth the few seconds! And as I said, I've had mine done twice and both times it's now healed (I plan to get it redone soon) and there is absolutely no sign on my nose that it was ever there. They use a very thin stud so it's not like lip piercings etc where it's thick bar that leaves a bit of a hole behind. That's the only reason I'm answering this question without being disapproving lol - if you were here saying you were getting a tattoo or something that will leave a scar at your age I'd be ranting about how you should wait until you're older. But I've never known anyone be scarred by a nose piercing so if you change your mind you can always take it out, so it's one of the less harmful things a teenager can do! Good luck!<br>  <br>  Oh I forgot to say about price. Well I'm in England, but here it usually ranges anything between ￡10-￡25. It's usually one of the cheaper piercings. But MAKE SURE they do it with a needle. If you see an amazingly cheap deal, it probably means they'll use a gun. (You can get them here for as little as ￡3 - that's with a gun). If someone gets a gun out, run a mile, only ever let someone pierce it with a needle.|`|AA10962298	You'll be fine, but it makes it a little hard to pick....|`|6Qs1VnSfaa	i had mine done but i took it out because it got annoying. But besides that i think it looks really good. I have 11 piercing plus my lip and nose which i took them out. So out of 10 i would have to give it a 6, it really depends how sensitive you are. It can cost from around $60 - $90, really depends where you go. And yes the hole will go away. <br>  I say get it done, it doesnt hurt that much and besides it looks really good.|`|kiIqpZ18aa	IT COST  ABOUT 90 DOLLARS WHERE I LIVVE SO I DECICED TO GET CHEAP AND DO IT MYSELF.. BAD IDEA. ITS BEEN TWO YEARS AND IT STILL HASNT HEAL. IDK IF ITS THE TYPE OF NOSE RING IM USING. BUT IT HURTS BUT ONNLI FOR A SEC. IF U GET IT PROFESSIONALLI DONE.. PAIN SHUD BE LIKE A 5 OR 6.

I have my nose pierced, and for me it cost $65. The hole could close up if jewelry if left out of it long enough, like any other piercing. If you feel as though you're ready for it, got for it. No one's stopping you!

Zy3RCkObaa	Cool t-bags will take down the puffiness. When u r done with that try some eyeliner. If you wear white eyeliner in your inner lower lid, you won't even be able to tell. Also, this is gross, but beauty queens use Preparation H under their eyes for the bags. Ive never tried that but I heard it kinda stings, but works. Hey, feel better. If something or someone makes you cry they aren't worth the tears ;)|`|ytGaDM7Haa	ice has never helped me with puffy eyes from allergies (it just gets worse when you finally remove it).

But just for a one-time quick fix, don't do this all the time (not that you cry all the time anyways ...or do you?).|`|QW4jdXGjaa	I've heard that you should put a washcloth in the freezer and once it's slightly icy, to run it over the puffy areas.|`|n7OYTY0aaa	My eyes get really tired everytime that happens to me so I take a nap and the next morning it's gone!|`|KH9HROrSaa	put tea bags in the fridge for 20 minutes.<br>  try chamomile, the caffeine and coolness will help reduce puffiness. <br>  lay them on your eyes for 10 min.<br>  if you don't have tea bags, try spoons.<br>  <br>  hope you feel better.|`|7w3Lry7saa	Use ice placed in a napkin.

UT5HS39Daa	I don't really have any sources, but I get split ends VERY easily.  Keep in mind that I'm a nurse, not a cosmetologist.  What I suggest is first of all, go get your split ends removed, then ask your stylist to suggest to you a shampoo and conditioner that is going to be good for you and you're hair type.  I've heard that most shampoo and conditioner's don't actually remove or prevent split ends, but some can help you hair be healthier. I use Treseme frizz free shampoo and conditioners.|`|LZk1lM7Naa	Ok.<br>  <br>  1. NEVER comb hair when soaking wet. Hair breaks easier when wet.<br>  Comb it after it air/towel dries for a while.<br>  <br>  2. Start from the bottum up FINGER combing undoing any knots when you get a snag. Be careful to not cause breakage while finger combing. <br>  <br>  3. Once you feel confident your hair has to snags or a lot less then use a COMB, preferably wide tooth comb to comb your hair.<br>  <br>  4. NEVER brush your hair. it causes a lot more breakage then combing or finger combing.<br>  <br>  5. Don't wear hair ties with the metal thingy on it. it breaks your hair when it gets snagged on it.<br>  <br>  6. Do this all the time and your hair will look great!

tight ones. if u want u could straighten it also but if u do then u gotta put a pin/clip in it. like something that matches your dress, cause staright hair all by itself is ugly and boring, especially for grad. i say curl it brown hair is beautiul curled, and if ur hair is already curly naturally then if u want loose pretty curls starighten it then curl it.|`|TMkHzArLaa	Try theses:<br>  <br>

AA10700596	ohhh for sure if you like those colors you need berry daring and bright lights big color. the first one is a bright fushia and the second is like a coral color with lots of shimmer in it. you should go on their website and click "try on this color" they have a nail salon thing where you pick your skin tone and click on either a collection name like brights or designer collection or you can click on a color group like pinks or reds. im on there all the time. you should look in the brights collection if you like bright colors. good luck!!!! hope this helps!|`|9DJ63NKdaa	ohhh you deff need midnight purple!!! i love love love it!! btw thats not exactly what its called but its something like that!|`|E7VFHwSKaa	Personally, I have found that China Glaze has better neon colors.  <br>  <br>  I would defiantly look at their selection first.|`|QFEbDUTAaa	summer green. it is awsome, and ocean green

The best thing I found for lips is medicated Blistex the kind in the white tube. It might burn a little if your lips are as cracked as you say they are. Also try Mary Kay lip treatment it is a kit that has a lip cleaner, lip cream, and lip moisture. It works wonders. Also drinking lots of water will help your skin and lips keep hydrated.|`|nnqpPVhGaa	It could be that you damaged your lips (my friend has, and she usually has the same problem) there isnt much you can do, unless you see a doctor about getting some medically perscribed stuff.

However, your lips may be too raw to use a medicated lip balm at this time.  If I were you, I would apply a lip balm every hour or so for a few hours before bed.  Make sure you lips are nice and soft and then use a soft bristle toothbrush to GENTLY scrub your lips.  This will act as an exfoliant and help with the peeling dry skin.  Do this every other night until the peeling goes away.  Then you can start using a medicated lip balm.  Try using Burt's Bees brand.  I'm a lip balm addict and this is the best thing  I've come across.  It doesn't clump, goes on smoothly, has a nice tingling feeling and lasts for a few hours.|`|cQ9T3YNmaa	dont peel it off.<br>  here is what i did:<br>  <br>  every night put vaseline on an old toothbrush and then scrub ur lips in a circular motion.<br>  in the morning put on vaseline too.<br>  every hour during the day keep supplying ur lips with chapstick<br>  and then it will be smooth ;)<br>  <br>  oh and dont pick at it, it makes it worse. that may be the source of your problems.<br>  also during class if you are wearing a sweatshirt with a kind of texture at the hem, like a school sweatshirt has that  striped texture at the end of the sleeve<br>  then wipe it across ur lips and all the dry skin will come off easily and wont make it cracked.<br>  make sure to apply chapstick before you do that tho |;<br>  <br>  try:<br>  MAC tinted lip conditioner. it makes my lips so soft!<br>  i used to be like you and its really annoying to have dry lips but yeah now its smooth :D<br>  dont lick your lips if u do! try not to!|`|ZY2GT7edaa	do you ever lick your lips? because that may be what is causing your chapped lips. my cousin wants got a bacterial infection from licking his lips too much and then being exposed to too much wind etc. if it continues, go to the doctor. otherwise, sit it out...burt's bees is also very good and natural to put on...|`|ddkVFlojaa	ew
50eec528d28a6c9e6975ac8b0d604143aa	You should try gently exfoliating your skin.<br>  <br>  Get a wet towel and rub the dry looking spots, and use your moisturizer right after.

r4i7xPnMaa	Celina and Shea seem to have the right idea. Any time you switch skincare products, you face has to "get used" to them. If you want to stick with Neutrogena, give it about 3-4 weeks to see results. If you're still getting breakouts, maybe switch back to AcneFree. <br>  <br>  If you do switch back to AcneFree, Neutrogena makes an oil-free moisturizer with SPF 45. I use it in the mornings when I know I'll be outside. It's called Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer or something along those lines, and you can find it at just about any drugstore. It comes in a light blue box.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|lPCjNkEnaa	Use AcneFree cleansers and get a moisturizer with SPF 15 or higher.|`|50eec528d28a6c9e6975ac8b0d604143aa	Visit a dermatologist!!!<br>  <br>  They would prescribe something that would solve your problems with a few tries, no more dry skin or burning.<br>  :c<br>  <br>  But I would switch back to AcneFree, you could damage your skin using something that makes you still break out.<br>  <br>  If you look at the main ingredient in AcneFree there's most likely another brand that has that same ingredient that seems to work, but the overall solution may let you go out in the sun~!|`|DLOOCkhxaa	As crazy as it sounds, give it about 30 days. When you go from one product to another, its common to breakout because your skin isn't used to it. It should get better day after day & after about 30 days of continuously breaking out, stop using it immediately. Other than that give it some time, TRUST ME!

r4i7xPnMaa	If the lids are coming off your eyeshadows, maybe think about picking up a 15 pan palette or a quad palette? That way, you can have a place for all your shadows, with a lid that will stay closed.<br>  <br>  If not, tape those bad jackies closed. Or find a bunch of small rubber bands and rubber band them closed.<br>  <br>  As far as concealer melting goes, it's not a good idea to keep it anywhere where it could melt. Even if your bag doesn't seem hot, if your concealer is melting, that's probably not a good sign. Maybe buy a sample jar (either from MAC or from anywhere else that sells little jars... most craft/hobby shops do) and put a blob of your concealer in that? That way, you can leave the rest of it at home, so you'll have a backup if one decides to melt.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|1yJIifDXaa	When it crumbles, you can put it in Vaseliene, and now you have creme eye shadow
JTg8QWiCaa	If you put it on the waterline (the inside) it makes your eyes appear smaller and if you put it on your lashline (the outside) it makes your eyes appear bigger.<br>  <br>  I usually put eyeliner on my waterline but i use one of the gel type eyeliners. If you use liquid eyeliner i would advise not to use it on your waterline. I tried this before and when i blinked it went into my eyeball and burned so...lol just a warning!<br>  <br>  Ive been using eyeliner on my waterline since i was 13 and im 17, so no, i don't believe you can get an eye infection, just make sure you use makeup remover to take it off each night =)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped you, Sorry it was so long, lol!|`|50eec528d28a6c9e6975ac8b0d604143aa	You run a greater risk of infection by putting it on the inside of your water line.<br>  <br>  But you keep your eyeliner clean and replace it every few months then it should be fine.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that if your eyeliner was that bad, you'd get an infection even putting it on the outside.|`|xN2JUcmvaa	I put mine on the inside, but just keep your eyeliner clean by not sharing it with anyone else or making sure its not left opened or things like that.  :]<br>  <br>  [Super late answer!] Hope this gave you some more perspectives.

i6myVXoCaa	One of the best (and easiest) recipes I tried was the extra virgin olive oil (EVOO) and sugar scrub. Olive oil works as well, but extra virgin works better.<br>  <br>  3 tbs of EVOO<br>  1/2 cup of sugar<br>  2 tbs of honey or aloe vera<br>  <br>  1. Mix the EVOO and honey/aloe into the sugar. If the paste is too sticky, add water until it becomes spreadable.<br>  2. Apply to face, leave on for about 5 minutes.<br>  3. Gently rub your face with your hands when washing, using the sugar to exfoliate. Your skin should be extremely soft and moisturized.<br>  <br>  If you have acne, the aspirin mask works great! Simply get 2~3 (not too much) tablets of uncoated aspirin, drop in a few drops of water until it dissolves and crush it with your finger to form a paste. Spread the mask onto your face and leave it on for about 10 minutes. Exfoliate when you wash the mask off.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|yIRcd5X8aa	This is a good recipe and it works naturally and its the best I have ever used!<br>  <br>  Orange peel - half orange<br>  Almonds - a few<br>  Plain yogurt - few table spoons<br>  rose water - 1 tablespoon<br>  honey - 2 teaspoons<br>  Lemon juice - few squirts<br>  <br>  Mix all of those in the grinder/blender just enough of make a paste and apply to your face once daily =)|`|OU3AqsHBaa	You need 2 Tbsp. ground oats, 2 tsp. brown sugar, 2 Tbsp. aloe vera and 1 tsp. lemon juice.  Mix it all together thoroughly, gently massage it onto your skin and rinse it off.|`|ZY2GT7edaa	how? apply a generous amount onto hands. and put on face. gently make circles onto the exfoliator onto your face so that it produces a foaming reaction. once all surfaces of your face is covered, let sit for a couple seconds, and rinse off. pat face dry. apply moisturizer.|`|pfgnSDT8aa	I use St Johns apricot scrub.

They will use a tool called a lance/extractor and take them clean them out. BUT BE CAREFUL because if they do not know what they are doing it can scar you.

If you need to clean your hair so you can restyle it just use a tiny bit of shampoo and conditioner... or if you can skip the shampoo shower add a little conditioner and rinse|`|K0Oh0p6Daa	Your actually suppose to wash your hair first b4 you dye it but no I'll would wait unitl tommorow even if you did it now no the dye wouldn't come out it's in permenately now.|`|SLL66Avnaa	wheater you do it yourslef . or qet it down you qet it washed . so either way just do the req. wash and then wait till 24 hours or the next day .|`|nn8AdxnZaa	no shampoo!<br>  but conditioner is perfectly fine|`|VagRIJlEaa	You shouldn't.|`|TTgqu8i9aa	i dont think so. But if you get a special kind than yeah.|`|Ijza3n2vaa	Depends on how intense the Dying was. If you Dyed it from a very dark brown or black you should wait or it will almost certainly cause damage that will be very noticeable ( as in a pile of screwed up fluff on your head )<br>  However, if the dying was fairly light(from a light brown or dark blonde) then you should be fine.|`|5UbC5hP9aa	It depends what color you dyed it. If it was red then I say no, because this dye comes out so easily anyway. But if it is any other color it is harmless. One extra wash is not going to ruin your job.  I dye my hair blonde and always wash it when I rinse the dye out to get rid of some of the chemical smell.|`|UBmxjdGkaa	I wouldn't reccomend washing it if you don't have to. Feel your hair is it dry? Is it greasy? If it's wet or greasy than no. Or else, ask your stylist, she can give you good advice. I bet it would come out just a bit, those things have to be permanent-ish.|`|6BUooZ0Caa	It will just come out a little bit but i would wait until at least tomorrow morning depending on how long you want the color to last. Or if you really want to tonight then use a color protecting shampoo.|`|zqmghc3Haa	it depends on the dye you used. <br>  And also it might end up looking multicolored if you do it.<br>  Its best to wait a week.|`|jGqVPrzEaa	other than with the conditioner that comes in the package, I would wait until the next morning. This will help leave the color more vibrant and shinier.|`|qUvmJ9rAaa	you should wait until at least 24 hours after...if you do it before then the color is more likely to come out. <br>  just rinse out your dye and condition your hair, don't shampoo|`|GxBDYocGaa	well it wont ruin your color but it will make your color come out faster <br>  <br>  futher advice is not to wash it for at least a day after you color it|`|3mXMwi9daa	well...if you dyed your hair at a salon dont they wash your hair after dying it?<br>  <br>  and it wont all come out but it will fade faster|`|AlrCZJ3saa	NO DONT DO IT!

d548a740621c8e6ba2aae8985959861caa	I guess you should go with what the piercer says, but nose screws are the best. Pins fall out, bones hurt terribly and destroy your piercing, rings are okay but they're a totally different look.<br>  <br>  I got pierced in a screw and love it. Doesn't hurt, and I like that if it catches on something like a tissue, it will not get ripped out and hurt, the top half comes out but the curve keeps it in gently. The only thing with screws is that the first couple times you take them out and put them back in, it hurts some and is really hard to do. But once you know what you're doing, it's a breeze.|`|NdERdQJUaa	I think he would know better than you<br>  I would trust him on that one|`|Q4ai8CuCaa	It all depends on how your piercer decides to pierce you. With a professional and trustworthy piercer you shouldn't be able to feel any pain. There maybe slight discomfort but that is only when the screw is passed through the hollow needle and the tubing/needle (whatever you wish to call it) is being pulled out of your nostril.<br>  <br>  The great thing about nostril piercings if that you have the freedom to have them done with a screw, ring or fishtail. Do what you think is comfortable and is best but I swear honestly and truthfully you will not feel a thing with either type of jewelry.|`|l7awPSUkaa	Usually we (body piercers) like to us the our own jewelry so we know the grade of metal it's made of and that's it's sterile.<br>  So it would be best to go with what he advises. At least until it's healed.<br>  Once that happens, it's up to you.  I don't like nostril "screws" or "nose bones" but some of my customers love them.  That is a personal preference to be decided later. <br>  For right now, I'd listen to your piercer. <br>  <br>  Take care!<br>  xoxo<br>  Bean.|`|TgjEjC8faa	I Think Getting Just The Starter Nose Jewerly<br>  They Give You When You Get Your Nose Pierced<br>  Is Better.

RUWy5Z6Daa	I use Bare Escentuals make up 'Bare Minerals' myself and its actually great for even the worst of skin conditions. Its a light powder but it does great coverage and lets your skin breathe. A Get Started kit is about 60-65 dollars and comes with foundation, brushes that are amazing and a how-to video. It also comes with a mineral veil. Also...do you moisturize night and day? If not...it will definetly improve your skin condition! I use Clean and Clear Soft Oil-free Moisturizer. They have one labeled DAY and one labeled NIGHT. It works great, keeps acne away, makes your skin feels sooo soft and the day one has SPF 15 in it! Other than that, wearing a neutral eye shadow color and mascara with a neutral lip color will look natural. Bare Minerals is pricey but its worth it and very good for your skin. Most liquid foundations clog your pores and make your skin condition alot worse. The moitsturizers I told you about are cheap (less than 10 dollars each and can be found at Wal-Mart!) Also..never wear your make up to bed! Make sure you wash it off...if you already have acne issues...this only makes matters worse. Id also suggest using moisturizer and then primer before you put on your make up . Good luck!|`|164d21ed8ebea68c695ae00635cca015aa	not wear any? that looks natural. ;) no, im joking. bare minerals.|`|3kRnw3eNaa	I use Covergirl Aqua Smooth. But, I am beginning to hate it because it gets all cakey by the end of the day!|`|RzU0zFgBaa	Bare Minerals works really well for covering things up but looks completly natural.

I'm LOVING it!  <br>  <br>  for your redness, i was just thinking-- u should try Bare Minerals Blemish Therapy.  It's  a powder that has natural ingredients in it (like tea tree stuff) that calms your skin and best of all u can wear it under your makeup.

They are a bit pricey, but the product blends into your skin and it doesn't feel like you are wearing any makeup.  Recently I had my makeup done at a dept. store and I could not wait to get home and wash it off, it felt so heavy on my face.|`|yIRcd5X8aa	Dior's Mineral Makeup from SEPHORA , expensive but it's the best out there.|`|0xBvybIxaa	i use natural rice DUAL WET & DRY foundation. i buy it at sally's beauty suplies in california. it only cost $13. i like the results. it covers my pimples that i get. and i get a red mark on my nose and some black heads, but with it you can't even tell. as for acne use either clean and clear acne control(works great) or oxy pads work great taking away my black heads. or(kinda expensive) murad(buy at abeauty store) it's an acne kit, but works great you can feel it working and great results.<br>  and for natuaral look just use foundation, maybe some light blush(blend it with foundation) and mascara to bring out eyes. <br>  good luck hope this helped.|`|epJiFbM4aa	alright sweetie, check it. It's not difficult to acheive a beautiful, fresh faced look. and you don't have to buy bare minerals to get it. <br>  Start off by washing your face gently with just soap and water. Dove soap and lukewarm water. towel dry (pat, don't rub...) pull your hair back into a pony and use a facial moisturizer on your face. Moisturizers not only help to blend makeup better but also keep your makeup on your face for longer, through the day. <br>  After you've done this, use a light concealer but ONLY in troble spots. The key to covering up pimples is to use a small amount of concealer on the tip of your pinkie finger and to only dot the pimple once, maybe twice. after that you use a sponge to blend the area around the blemish. After you've done this, give your face a light dusting with powder and then with an even lighter dusting of bronzer. <br>  <br>  I never cared for foundation. I don't find it necessary to create an even, clear look- as long as I prime my face for makeup application beforehand. washing with a mild soap and towel patting dry, and then applying moisturizer beforehand is crucial to the makeup application process.<br>  <br>  good luck!!! :)

And stop trying to impress all the boys, your 13, relationships at your age dont last long.|`|AA10060784	13-year-old guys don't care about your personality. At that age, it's all about the boobies. Guys don't get mature enough to carry on a real relationship until the last few years of high school or so. Before that, it's just dates and kisses and gossip and writing notes to put in each other's lockers. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but don't be expecting true love in a middle school relationship.<br>  <br>  Guys like any clothes that show off the shape of your body, really. You don't necessarily have to show skin to be sexy if your clothing fits you well.|`|MPztCHj0aa	Guys have a biological desire to "look at the goods," so to speak, so they like tight tshirts.  However, that doesn't mean you ought to buy a lot of skintight tees and parade around.  That can be pretty tacky--and very inappropriate for your age.<br>  There's nothing wrong with jeans.  Also nothing wrong with normal tshirts.<br>  Just worry about the school dress code and focus on looking polished.<br>  <br>  Also, every guy has a different taste in personality.  If you try to adapt to their tastes, you will lose your own personality in the process.  Please don't do that.  I know it sounds trite, but I'm 7 years older than you and do know that "just be yourself" is actually invaluable advice.|`|FbAlYFymaa	At that age all guys look for is cleavage... your choice to show it at your age or not...

EHFqesQuaa	How do I fix it;<br>  <br>  You fix it by buying some eye cream.  You can get some eye cream at your booths in the mall, which sells a lot of cream, or you can get one from burt's bees. It's an Eye cream, but I'm not sure if that fixes your Baggy eyes. <br>  <br>  Why does this happen;<br>  <br>  It happens cause you're not getting enough sleep. For example, if you sleep at 11:00 P.M. or 12:00 P.M.  then that's probably why. Cause you need at least 10 hours of sleep or more. But it depends on the time you wake up too. Sorry if that was confusing, I explained as well as I could. Hope I helped<br>  <br>  ~*Angela*~
z93tSvKxaa	Why do you want a vibrator?|`|3cwY3Lcpaa	No one under the age of 18 should want, or need one.|`|AA11080680	The legal age is 18 in the United States. Not sure how old you are but if you have an 18 year old friend that would be willing to purchase it for you that is one way of buying one. Have you asked your mom to help you? Just asking because I am very open with my daughters whom both are adults now however when they were younger and wanted things like this or other things that they were to young to purchase they came to me and we talked about it and depending on why I normally would help them out. I am very open with my girls they have always came to me with questions about sex, drugs, etc...<br>  Good luck and if your younger than 16, I do think you are to young to buy a vibrator.

Ipso Facto in Fullerton. Stella Dottir in LA (I'm sure there are LOADS more in LA). My best suggestion to you is buying pieces from normal stores, like black skirts and such, and adding on via the internet (especially if you have a problem ordering clothes online). For example, I made my own skirts for the longest time by grabbing whatever black (especially velvet) clothing I found in stores and adding on lace, D rings and even straps for a more industrial look, ribbon, etc. You can even find hooks and things online to sew on in two rows to everything from skirts and pants to shirts and dresses and lace like a corset.

On2fzgpOaa	You could just wait until the winter to get it pierced, then you wouldn't have to worry about swimming. Not sure about the other questions, since I don't have mine pierced. But good luck!!|`|lU8e0VQFaa	You only need to wait 2 months before swimming in a pool, hot tub or ocean, so if you get it done now you should be able to go swimming for summer. Also, unless the piercing begins to reject and you don't remove it, if there is any scaring it will be very minimal. As for pregnancy, just don't leave the jewelry in and it won't stretch out.|`|vfVEndySaa	First you just relax. Making this choice should be fun, not stressful. If you take care of the piercing it should heal just fine, and you can take the ring out when you are pregnant or leave it in. The choice is yours. I think navel piercings look good with bathing suits.

Good Luck.|`|DcPecgwQaa	Definitely something moderate like a suit. Well, it doesn't need to be a suit, but it should definitely be something appropriate. I highly recommend that you don't wear jeans, it look so informal. Although you are just interview at a local small restaurant, the person that interview you will determine if you get the job by how you dress. If you just dress casually then they might think you are not serious, especially since you're a teen. Probably wear something navy.

I like to wear skirts and dresses to work and I would never do so without stockings.  There are some dresses and skirts I would not wear (regardless of the season) without stockings because dressy outfits require stockings.  Wearing stockings does not bother me nearly as much as they seem to irritate my friends, but I LOVE to wear summer skirts without stockings every day when the weather is warm.|`|c05702374b5bc85f3a1502d55060a46eaa	Is good of San Francisco wear skirt, not wear hose, not so cold, need pantyhose under skirt go New York of winter. If cold, I wear pants or hose.|`|hceSZoAkaa	i dont wear skirts in the winter period with or without  pantyhose, leggings and what not. no way.|`|8A1m7YkMaa	Okay, personally, I never liked pantyhose. I'm more of a leggings/tights person. And people do wear pantyhose, so it was never really out.<br>  You wear that kinda of stuff in the winter if you're willing to freeze to look "cool". But if you live down south, the winters aren't really cold, but wear I live, the winters are usually -15, so not many people do that. Also, if you're not going to be out in the cold really long (like walking from your car in the parking lot to a mall or something) some people tend not to bother. & Pantyhose doesn't really keep your legs warm. It's thinner than tissue paper!|`|18b60f3790e90c5b572538c81087cfbdaa	Absolutely Pantyhose.  <br>  Warmth.<br>  Look.<br>  Feel.<br>  Texture.<br>  Fashion/Style.<br>  Allure/Sexy...!<br>      Not wearing Pantyhose is more than 'out'.  It is for little girls<br>  and 'brittany' followers that were whining about getting dressed-up. <br>  (notice Sexy adult Cheerleaders (Dallas Cowboy Cheerleaders, etc)<br>  all wear smooth Pantyhose, whereas the middle school and most high school ones go w/out (still rebelling).<br>       Sadly people follow the media, but fortunately we have sexy, beautiful, glamorous Women that are popular now, and most all of them were smart enough to realize that the 'fat pants' wal-mart shopper look is not only 'out' - it was stupid.  'Brittany' types are in the trash tabloids glorifying their white-trash status.  The well dressed sexy Ladies are far more sought after every day now and pretty much never seen without smooth Pantyhose!  Zooey DesChanel, Rhianna, Katy Perry, Lindsay, Kate Middleton, Mischa Barton, Lilly Allen, Beyonce, Sienna Miller, Jeanette Biedermann, Kylie Minogue, Amanda Bynes, Kathrine McPhee, Blake Lively, 'Gossip Girls', Jane Krakowski, Ashley Simpson, 'Sugarbabes', Allyson Hannigan,  etc...

She usually wears a pair of knee high boots and is inside most of the time anyways.|`|eAhz7Hptaa	This bare leg trend is terrible, and quite weird. It is mainly just because some fashion commentators and so called experts declared pantyhose are out, unfashionable, for old ladies and whatever other nonsensical reasons they invented not to wear them. It’s pure nonsense of course.<br>  Good pantyhose always make any pair of legs look better. Plus it’s just nice to wear them and they can actually be worn in any season, not only in winter. Never been able to figure out why anyone doesn’t want to wear them.<br>  To come to the second part of your question: Yes, of course I think pantyhose should come back mainstream and hopefully they will. Pantyhose rule.

Your hair isn't going to fall out just because its thin.. so you have nothing to worry about.|`|YokvyU6Xaa	you need to do a strand test first. A box of hair dye will instruct you on how to do that. If it is your first time trying it make sure to follow the directions on the box carefully. If you leave it on too long it could fall out, worst case scenario. It could also just damage your hair severely. It can make it unmanageable and tangled and frizzed. They do have Malibu treatments if such were to occur.

EQAwlKZ5aa	Yes, you can use Henna. It's used as a substitute to dye. Look it up, it's actually very good for your hair. The only problem with henna is that there aren't many colors available. There is red henna and black henna. The red is kinda Orange in color, and the black is like a very dark red when applied to the hair. Some people mix it with coffee to adjust the color. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hennaforhair.com/techniques/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hennaforhair.com/techniques/i...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.hennaforhair.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hennaforhair.com/</a>

Wait 20 minutes and wash it as usual.<br>  <br>  Contraceptive pills to make your hair grow fast:<br>  Buy a packet of contraceptive pills of any brand or type. Take 10 to 15 pills and put them in a plastic bag and crush them carefully until they become powder. Add the powder to the shampoo bottle used normally, mix it well and let it stand at least one day. Then use the shampoo as usual.<br>  <br>  The moon to make the hair grow faster <br>  Have your ends slightly trimmed every month on first quarter day. The cut will give strength to the hair and the moon effects over all the bodies will enhance the growth the next month.<br>  <br>  There are more options on this website that you can use for hair nourishment and other things too. <br>  <a href="http://beauty.comohacerpara.com/en/n2459/tips-to-make-hair-grow-much-faster.html" rel="nofollow">http://beauty.comohacerpara.com/en/n2459...</a><br>  <br>  Just make sure you dont overload hour hair with too many products.

There are two thinks you can do: 1.Get clip in extensions from Ulta. Like the Hair Do, Jessica Simpson ones. They have real human hair$$$ or fake hair which is alot cheaper. You just wear them during the day, but in the summer that might get hot and I don't think you should swim with them. Or 2. Go to a salon that offers hair extensions. The salon will take a small(like really small) section of your hair and then take a piece of human hair(don't use fake hair for this) and either braid and melt it to your hair or use glue(which I would not sujust) Now you must remember that these kinds of hair extensions might damage your hair if not done right and it can cost alot, sometimes $500-$2000.

HnEcgVGiaa	Solution via health & exercise:<br>  <br>  Concentrate on exercises that promote thigh stretching, such as running and swimming. For stretches, lunges and squats are effective. However, these stretches might put some stress on your knees, so take caution while doing these exercises. Use dumbells or weights to make your body do some extra work.<br>  <br>  Some tips on stretching:<br>  <br>  *  Stand, keeping your feet apart and bend downwards from the waist. With your right hand, try to touch your left foot ankle. Hold for a few seconds and come back to your original position. Now with your left hand, make an attempt to touch your right foot ankle. Alternating the sides, do about 10-15 reps.<br>  <br>  * Stand with your feet apart, resting your hands on your thighs. Keeping your back straight, bend your knees, allowing your hands to slide down your thighs, so as to touch your knees. Hold this position for a couple of seconds and then get back to the original position. Do about 10-15 reps.<br>  <br>  There shouldn't be any concern regarding building too much muscle in your thighs, as females then to have leaner and slimmer thighs the more they work out compared to males who can have thick muscular thighs.<br>  <br>  You won't see results immediately because skin and fat may be covering up the muscles. But you should definitely be able to feel them working.<br>  <br>  As for food, stick to whole and multi-grain for carbs. But stick with a relatively high-protein diet, concentrating on meats such as chicken and fish. Egg whites provide a huge boost to protein supply; take the yolk out. Of course, veggies and fruits are mandatory. Stay away from soft drinks and fast food as well.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  Solution via fashion:<br>  <br>  Skinny jeans are no-nos if you have short legs. A lot of girls think that these actually make them look slimmer, but for short legged girls, it only slims down below their knees.<br>  <br>  Take caution when wearing tight-fitting clothing, as they restrict blood circulation. Your muscles need oxygen from your blood to be healthy. Don't force your thighs to look thinner.<br>  <br>  For short and medium length legs, try bootcut or flare jeans or pants. These fit through your thighs and then slightly flares out to make your legs look longer and slimmer.<br>  <br>  Also, darker colors usually provide a slimming effect.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best,<br>  <br>  Brian|`|XeASdibHaa	The best thing to do is to make your body look longer so that your legs look longer, therefore they'll look thinner. <br>  <br>  In order to make your body look longer, you need to wear straight legged paints and heels. <br>  <br>  Hope I Helped!|`|IPirciPFaa	spanx or tights underneath|`|iYM7Jacyaa	everyone has fat thighs. it is for when you stretch your leg, for that muscle. it won't go away|`|Sh5ZJ2EUaa	wear loose jeans nd flare.  no skinny jeans!

Soon, I am getting a portrait on my thigh, now that I've finally found the perfect artist (I couldn't settle for mediocre with a portrait - has to be exceptional). This will be of my mother holding my son. She died 3 months ago and he will grow up and not remember her, but she loved him so much, I think as much as I do, and as there is only one existing photo of the two of them I want something special I can show him in the future to honour her memory. If people don't like that then screw them seriously.

Otherwise, strawberry blonde iz really pretty if it only has a lil bit of red mixed in, 1 of my friends has that hair color and i never really could tell if it wuz blonde or red, so i asked her 1 day she said it wuz strawberry blonde. itz a really pretty hair color and shines in the sun, i say get it if u hav long hair. good luck tho!!!!|`|gw7GoKAraa	No!

uCxYdyQXaa	You can't get rid of pores, the best you can do is try to reduce their size. Wash your face in the morning and afternoon, stay away from oily/fried foods and drink lots and lots of water. Especially the water part.|`|AA11402528	you cant do anything to their size. do you mean you have blackheads? you need to get a scrub and apply medication to it and let them clean out
JjlpLyskaa	well you may be young, but try this,<br>  <br>  for the one that is smaller, you can use a cup filler (sorry, i dont know the exact name) <br>  <br>  well my grandma had breast cancer about 12 years ago and she only has one breast and when she wears a bra, she puts one in thats equal to her other breast. so im sure if you  get one of these, it will definetly help!<br>  <br>  hope this works! :].|`|74we4Dgbaa	Oh that really sucks, but I figured out this idea.<br>  <br>  Get some of those bras that have the clip thing in the front.<br>  <br>  1 The size of your left boob.<br>  <br>  & 1 the size of your right.<br>  <br>  Cut the back down in half on both.<br>  <br>  So in total you have 4 half bras.<br>  <br>  Take the left side one of your left boob.<br>  <br>  & the right side one of your right boob.<br>  <br>  And sew the back where you cut them together.<br>  <br>  So you ahve the perfect size bra.<br>  <br>  & put it on & put the clips together.<br>  <br>  & Voila. :)|`|GEkLdveFaa	try a sock or tissue in small one even things out|`|MGOmVeMfaa	sorry the only thing i can think of is getting the size you need for the bigger boob and stuffing the other one

You know what average means, you just want to feel better about yourself so your going to look for what's different about you. No one can make you look different no matter what they say, you'll still look and feel the same at the end of the day, so stop worring about what you look like and start working on more important things like your confidence! <br>  <br>  <br>  Im not trying to be rude, Im trying to be honest. There are too many people in the world that care too much about what they look like and if others think they are special.<br>  <br>  Yea LYFAO because you ask such rediculous questions! Dont post questions up if you cant deal with the truth.|`|O6FgX9lVaa	Your better than average, not a 10 but at least an 8 in that pic.

AILK0BTiaa	honestly i would not recommend any hair straightener that i can buy at a drugstore or super mart... i would recommend buying a professional brand product such as Chi, Solia, GHD, etc.. they are worth the investment.. go to folica.com... they have reviews on their flat irons.. also don't forget to buy thermal styling products as well :o)|`|IeNvISdcaa	no i would not. With curly hair you need a hot temperature .... depending on your hair type (coarse or fine) you need a temperature of 210 - 430 degrees. This does not list temperature, usually it means it does not get hot. look for ones with temperature gages or dials.|`|t6VjgZIiaa	i actually recommend one from CONAIR it really works and its abt 20-30 dollars depending on whether they have it on sale or not and its at target
rMzuGEm7aa	Yeah, you would want to match your make up with your dress, but since your dress is camo, you want to stand out and not disappear, :) so you can match, but stand out at the same time. I would recommend using golds and bronzes for your eyes and cheeks, i think it would look nice.|`|FBGMKdqKaa	you could go natural... or deep orangey red lipstick with green-beige shimmery eyeshadow, peach blush and liner for a more glam look....<br>  <br>  or mix up the two - fierce eyes with natural, glossy pink lips...rrrROAR!<br>  <br>  nails - same - you could do a soft neutral or fierce red. <br>  <br>  have fun whatever you do!|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	You have the right colors just keep it natural...too much and you will look like Bozo the clown.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	If using a manual razor you need to use something to lubricate your skin, you don't need to use shaving gel or foam just as long as you use something to keep the razor smooth over your skin. The best thing to use is hair conditioner rather than soap or shave gel, this lets the blades slide over your skin so a close shave without razor rash, this only seems to work on legs though. Just choose a cheap conditioner for shaving, but be sure it's not too thin or else it won't work, another tip is to use a little olive oil on your skin before putting the conditioner on – this will help give you a smoother shave, it’s also moisturising so will improve the skin. Remember to moisturize after shaving too, I recommend olive oil with a little nice smelling essential oil as this is very moisturizing and very skin-friendly, it will also give your legs a glossy look making them appear smoother. Cuts on your legs take longer to heal, olive oil will help this too, or you might want to try Bio Oil to help heal cuts. Keeping your skin healthy will help when shaving as it’ll keep the shave smooth and helps prevent damage. <br>  <br>  Razor blades need replacing when they drag or you need to use more pressure, I recommend Gillette Venus Breeze, they're expensive but have skincare bars either side, these aren't needed but show when to replace, when you learn this yourself switch to cheaper razors. Remember to take care of your razor, give it a swish about in the water after each stroke, and don't leave anywhere wet or it'll rust.|`|yo30g3pPaa	I recomend using a men's razor. They are sharper, and me or my friends have NEVER cut ourselves with it. I mean its meant for the face so it won't cut easily. I change my blades when they get dull and I have to push on it harder to get it to shave.<br>  <br>  and no, if you do it in the shower you can use soap and water. but ALWAYS use something. You don't want razor burn.|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	Yes for men it is important to moisturize the skin while shaving and lessen the chance of cutting the skin then moisturize after to keep skin soft and from breakouts. Have fun and God Bless, Velle T|`|6uYVRaebaa	well i use foam because i get bumps, but it all really depends on your skin...they have different things for different symptoms

That causes those razor bumps people suffer from.  Mostly men shaving their faces.  It is a dermatological condition called Pseudofoliculitis Barbae.  Type that into the address bar and you will get a plethora of information to answer your exact question.|`|oyZEs1Fxaa	in  grown hair is hair that grows into ur skin after u shave it or something..instead of grown up n out, it grows out then folds into ur skin...|`|T1sJxnwOaa	when you shave and the hair grows back. sometime the hair can get caught in the skin and the hair keeps growing but doesn't come out. it hurts a little and most times you can see a hair under the skin.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	hair that has grown under the skin.

While ingrown hair most commonly appears in areas where the skin is shaved (beard, legs, pubic region), it can appear anywhere.|`|h66gC4xMaa	Ingrown hair looks like pimples on the skins surface. The pimple like blemish you see is actually the root of the hair and the hair is trying to grow underneath your skin. The hair will not grow as long as the hair on the outside of your skin.

hRNpGnktaa	Its doesnt speed it up as such, but there has been research into its effects on hair. It can make it grow thick and stronger but not necessarily quicker.<br>  For hair to grow quicker, increase your supplements of folic acids and keep a good diet to keep your metabolism in good flow. A good metabolism has been argued to aid hair growth|`|ZARozVAHaa	no but folic acid does|`|8vKrxSYyaa	I doubt it ... a healthy diet is more effective.|`|Nicf5B8faa	No, Biotin helps

But if I were you, I would brush and straighten it more, and make it less puffy in the back. The color works great on you, and you have a very pretty face and nice skin, so mostly I think it would look pretty with something sleek and shiny.|`|6uYVRaebaa	i love how it is now! lol if you want change get sonething done with the color? like highlights or lowlights, you can pull any color off, but id stay away from bright reds! try a plum brown? all over or lowlighted

8HPdqHTSaa	Lanilen (not sure of the spelling) helps for anything. It's not just for one purpose. I use it for my lips, but it can make your nose less red too.|`|YiwA7cFfaa	first off, start using lotion tissues.<br>  put vitamin E oil on the red and sore parts of your nose- it will moisturize and heal the soreness without burning like most lotions will.|`|iYM7Jacyaa	ok so get a medicine with an antihistamine to dry you up. then use tissues with vicks or lotion to soothe your nose. i would put vaseline on your red nose. hope i help|`|x0gquSCsaa	oh when i'm sick i use these tissues that have vicks in it...  they really help|`|VXQFT341aa	Have your mom get you an antihistamine to help dry that all up.

qxrr69bnaa	You need to use a lotion intended for tanning beds, anything else could damage the acrylics (the plastic you lie on while tanning) on the bed.  You will look darker if you use one with a bronzer.  I love the lotions that are silicone-based such as Intrigue by Designer Skin and Pomegranate by Squeeze.  You need to keep your skin moisturized after tanning, too.|`|bCjmjnqgaa	When youre tanning in a bed you shouldnt use outdoor lotions. Your skin should be well moisturized.

You will more than likely be labeled slutty or trashy.  Really only because you are in high school and kids are immature and mean.  I am all for experimenting with piercings and tattoos.  (i have many of my own) I just think you should wait until you are out of high school to do it.  High schoolers are mean!  We had a girl in my school get labeled a slut over an eyebrow piercing.

Just wait until you are out of high school to do it.|`|72t32mzKaa	Personally i dont think it is a good idea because if you are sitting it will dig in to your back and that aint a good thing.

(rollercoaster)|`|AA10940951	okay, honestly, that would just look stupid. Do something else like get your navel pierced or your tounge. Navel piercings dont hurt. If you are going to do anything on your lower back, I would just say stick to a tattoo. But your young and have plenty of time to think about it as you grow up and mature. Good Luck!!!|`|C1VuXSPfaa	why would you want to get a surface piercing??<br>  they are expensive, and realistically they don't last that long...maybe 4 months if you take really good care of it...<br>  and they leave really ugly scars, my friend is obsessed with surface piercings..I dont get it.??

Its a little more time consuming but all and all it works out very well, a razor can irritate your skin though if you do use the proper creams and aftershaves. <br>  <br>  An electric razor is more time efficient and not as irritating, but it does not give you the close clean shave that most seek, but if you are strapped for time and don't have 10-15 or so to use a razor this is your best choice.|`|6mnjYFwpaa	no difference only if you use razor youhave to use brush cream ...etc<br>  BUT if you use ele shaver you have not to use such type of thngs|`|ZARozVAHaa	electric faster and replace razor head<br>  normal dispose of and takes forever|`|ab595311acfbfd9b16a828da10437178aa	The electric shaver in my opinon doesnt do as good of a job as a razor, if your in a hurry use the electtric shaver, but the razor gives it a nice smooth shave.

YhjTbSmDaa	For starters, definitely start off with pencil, or a mechanical eyeliner, like you have.<br>  <br>  With green eyes, black is nice.<br>  Brown is very complimentary, also.<br>  <br>  To get a thin, straight line, I suggest keep the tip of your eyeliner pointy.<br>  <br>  If you pull the end of your mechanical off, theres a sharpener.<br>  If you use an actual wooden pencil, you can use a liner sharpener, or a regular pencil one works fine.<br>  <br>  <br>  One of the best tips i've learned is:<br>  <br>  TRY TO KEEP YOUR EYE OPEN.<br>  <br>  Really, you can get percision if you keep your eye open.<br>  And its easier to follow the actual shape of your lashline.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Just practice, really.<br>  You'll get better, trust me.|`|R848tHVDaa	Since you're starting, use a eyeliner pencil. That way you can get use to making lines around your lashes. Black or brown are good for green/hazel eyes. When you get comfortable, you can work your way on using liquid eyeliner, stick and gel.|`|uR5aNpHGaa	i like pencil personally but i have used that define-a-liner too and that works good<br>  but if you are having problems with using that kind then do not move onto liquid yet<br>  because if you cant get a thin line with other kinds of eye liner itll probably be too hard with liquid<br>  also if you want to work on getting a thinner line put the pencil or whatever right onto the lash line and kind or wiggle it side to side across the lash line<br>  thats what i do and it works for me|`|k73EdWITaa	I suggest using Rimmel Exaggerate Eye Definer. Its really good for beginners and Pros. With your eye color brown would be better than black but that's my opinion.<br>  Any who, a technique I have for putting on eyeliner on my top is first closing the eye with one hand and applying with the other. Start from either end and work your way across. If it still looks a little thick, get a oil-free make up remover and touch it up a little.<br>  <br>  I don't suggest you using liquid until you've mastered stick or pencil.|`|9UnKL2maaa	I'd recommend going to a makeup counter or a Mac Cosmetics store and asking one of the artists for help. Its a lot easier for them to show you, then to try and tell you online, and theyll do your makeup for you if you want. ALSO If you go to maccosmetics.com on the left hand side of the screen theres a column and at the bottom of it is a link for "live chat" and you can talk to a Mac makeup artist and ask them whatever you want. Thats super helpful as well.|`|rLV7I6q3aa	1. You can get a thinner, more precise line when the tip of the liner isn't dulled. If you have the self-sharpening kind of liner, carefull roll the tip on its side on a little piece of tissue and that will help make the end an actual pointed tip shape that will be more precise. Close your eye and with your free hand, hold eyelid taught and in place as you line.<br>  <br>  2. You could use a lot of colors, even a very dark blue or dark purple. For everyday, stick with a soft black or brown.<br>  <br>  3. I switch around and also use eyeshadow to line my eyes. It doesn't smear. You use a small angled brush that is slightly wet to do this. It really isn't tricky. The liquid is the most difficult type to apply, and is for a more dramatic look rather than everyday in most cases.
Q4ai8CuCaa	I've had the same thing.<br>  Clean it with a mixture of natural sea salts (some with added tea tree oils are a complete bonus).<br>  If you're looking for a product though to get rid of it there's a company called PROTAT which makes a spray specially designed for this type of thing.<br>  <br>  Use either the spray of the sea salts twice daily and it should go within 2 weeks.|`|AA11609606	I had the same thing happen.

CQVzUcw7aa	Use the opposite colour of your eyes. I would go with any colour to contrast your eyes. When you put the colour around your eye, don't put it all over your eye lid. Just put it from the outside of your eye to the inside, about a couple mm thick. Do this with the bottom of your eye up to the tear duct. Then blend both the top and bottom of your eye a bit with the white shimmer. So it's not a big contrast. <br>  <br>  Also add almost white shimmer to the inside of your eye (I think it's the tear duct) and also add it beneath the arch of your brow. This is supposed to make your eyes bigger and open them up.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|m6csdf5laa	You should put eyeliner on the top of your eye lids because ot makes them look bigger...also you should go to the store and find eye shadow tht were made for brown eyes and use that. That will make your eyes "pop." A good use of mascara and your set to go!!|`|AA10177707	almay has a line of eye products to bring out the color in your eyes, which will make them look biggerr.<br>  <br>  good luck.<br>  i totally understandd.|`|31gN5L58aa	eyeliner???????????????? or maybe eyeshadow, so they stand out more...and mascara!!!!|`|n206tDKlaa	i hae small eyes toooooooo!!!!<br>  <br>  You should start by concentrating on your brows.  Shape them so they don't have the close-together appearance. Next, use a soft red-brown brow pencil or a taupe powder brow liner - don't make the mistake of going too dark with your brow color, as this looks very unnatural and will make your skin look paler. Use  eye shadow on the upper outer half of the lid extending above the eye and under the brow. To offset the closeness of the eyes, start drawing the eye line on the upper lid away from the inner corner. Draw it up and out. Similarly, the lower line should not begin from the inner corner.<br>  <br>  For your coloring, try a pale champagne for the entire lid and medium brown, kaki or plum for the crease and corner. Use brown/black eyeliner to define your eyes and smudge lightly. Finish with black mascara, making sure to use an eyelash curler first.

LdlNMvsbaa	Well for one thing, if you aren't using a heat protectant before straightning, that could be a problem. You will be burning your hair even more without one, and that will take away the shine and healthy look to it. So, try a heat protectant product if you haven't already. (I recommend Tresseme Heat Tamer Spray- <a href="http://www.tresemme.com/heat/products/heat-tamer-protective-spray.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.tresemme.com/heat/products/he...</a><br>  <br>  Also, try using a leave-in conditioner. I use Garnier Fructis Sleek and Shine, and I love it because you can use it on wet or dry hair! It gives your hair such a healthy shine and really saves your split ends. So, try using a quater-size on damp hair before blow drying (making sure you get the ends well), and maybe even a little more when you are done straightning it to prevent frizz and leave it will a nice shine:)<br>  <a href="http://www.garnierusa.com/img/our_products/prd_haircare/FRUCTIS/P41052_pack.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.garnierusa.com/img/our_produc...</a><br>  <br>  If you want even more shine, try using a shine serem or spray. I use Redkin 02. You just mist 2-4 sprays onto your hair after your are done styling it for a beautiful shine:) (Just don't use too much of this.)<br>  <a href="http://www.goddess-within.com/revigl02mesh.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goddess-within.com/revigl02me...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helped!!

aHPDAqw0aa	I have a nose piercing and I was actually able to change it after one week (just whenever it looks healed and with cartilidge it is pretty fast). There are nose rings you can get they are sticks with a tiny ball on the end, You just push them through the hole (it hurts a teeny bit but not much and you get used to it and it might bleed, might not, either way not any different from the screws) and the ball holds it in place. You cant feel them, way better than the screws.

xwm5JZCkaa	Do you want it in green? Wear a white or purple tank under the jacket a necklace and some cute bracelets for a little for done up look. And blue jeans go with anything. Try skinny jeans. <br>  <br>  Do you want it in white? Ditch the white tank and swoop in a brown or black one. But really, white goes with every color. Again, jeans, perhaps black. Again, jewelry for a more dressy look. <br>  <br>  Do you want it in black? Black goes with any colored tank. Once more, jeans. Once more, some cute bracelets and a necklace for a nicer look. <br>  <br>  Do you want it in tan? Personally, I think that color isn't very...attractive. But a white tank while go with that.

TPUqEBReaa	When you tease the hair, do it from the back of the hair strand. This will keep it from being fuzzy, and when you style, make sure to smooth and spray any rough ends.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|eG67CjTpaa	In my opinion, this is the best way to tease hair:<br>  On dry hair work in a small amount of texturizing paste<br>  Take a clean, straight part just under the crown of your head no more that 1/2in thick, spray with hairspray or spray wax<br>  Using a teasing brush (like the one indicated in the link below), brush hair downward using quick strokes<br>  Take another parting above the first section, of the same size, and back brush with the same amount of stokes as the last (the key to a good poof is consistency), also spraying with product.<br>  Continue to the top section<br>  Once you have desired height, smooth the surface gently with your brush, check your poof for balance (if you see any indentions, you can use the tail of your brush to push the dent up) <br>  Mist lightly with hairspray and shine spray, now you have the perfect frizz free poof<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shopzilla.com/hair-care-appliances/teasing-brush/22015/products" rel="nofollow">http://www.shopzilla.com/hair-care-appli...</a>

6FIhIQ3Eaa	ive already realised it|`|f41f07330effd00e202635eab4dc96b5aa	You may consider this your rude awakening,....the world is FULL of self absorbed little sh*ts like you that think only about themselves. Why don't you use your head for something other than conditioner, and your heart for something other than just a blood pump; go donate some of your designer clothing(since you only wear it once), volunteer your time to a homeless shelter & hand out meals to some people that only get to eat maybe three times a week. Take an elderly shut-in to their doctor's appointment.... Try not to break your neck while you're looking down your nose at these people, and DON'T act as if you are above it all..... you're not.<br>  Quit being a professional victim and drama queen...drop the cell phone and grow the f*ck up!<br>  Perhaps you should go about the business of behaving like an actual human being.<br>  <br>  ...If thats your pic get out & get some sun!! -and eat something!!|`|qRBHTo6Oaa	Actually the world revolves around the sun, if the world revolved around you we would all be dead by now due to the fact that the world has to revolve around the sun in order to sustain life . Seriously, get over yourself.|`|WwzNeonIaa	That's lame. The world shouldn't only revolve around you and if you do want the world to revolve around you, well then that's pretty sad because you should LOVE yourself so much, that's pathetic!|`|8fRErqk6aa	When you realize it doesn't.|`|eJf8LNg5aa	Well I certainly wouldn't. I hate stuck-up fags like you.|`|oAAXDN5Jaa	sorry they are thinking of MEEEEE!|`|9ZkEQRa2aa	lol|`|viQfxWEXaa	ew|`|kCTGf3qfaa	That's tragic.
Rf2r23sYaa	If you process your hair (bleach, straighten, perm, color) then you need to quit doing that because it is probably the source of your problem. Also, using products with alcohol in them and using heat on your hair can cause breakage. If you aren't doing any of these things and your hair is breaking then you have a serious problem and you need to see a doctor because your body is not receiving or processing nutrition properly.|`|7RUqEJzLaa	That's not good. Tell your mom as soon as possible. And if you straighten your hair or curl it, don't. Just let it be for a couple days and let it air dry not blow dry.|`|yxm5DIZ3aa	if you dye your hair a lot or use heat on it or are anerexic then that could cause it... but definately tell a parent or gaurdian immeadiatley before it gets woorse! good luck!|`|Y0pFoz4caa	tell your mom or gaurdian this could be serious i suggest you go to the doctor
VenYUtH6aa	When you straighten your bangs you need to pull them up and forward with your flat iron. This way the roots have volume and then you can just sweep them to the side. My friend is a hairstylist and when I had side bangs this is how she would always do them for me. Once they are to the side, spray them a little with an aerosal hair spray :) good luck!|`|Zk5PTmrfaa	Blow-dry it and add a voluminous hair spray to make your hair have more body, and use the Herbal Essenses body shampoo...it's good :D<br>  "Train" them to be on the side so there's no "gaps" or spaces between them...you have to style them to the side since your hair is straight.<br>  Use hairspray after too so it stays.<br>  Good luck :]
Ed7DAVZraa	It's possible, but I don't think you should worry. When periods first start, barely anything comes out so even if you don't have a pad or a tampon, it won't leak out onto your pants for everyone to see. If you're really worried, you can always wear black pants or really dark jeans so that if it does leak out, no one will notice. Carry a pad or a tampon around and I would suggest using those instead of toilet paper if you think you're going to have your period.<br>  <br>  Last but not least, ask your mom about it.|`|uAzToWC7aa	at scool-go up to the office get a pad, yea ur probably gonna get it soon, but ask ur mom when she got hers because you get it around her age, and if it leaked through-wrap someting around ur waist, so good luck! ( :|`|JEdP02Oeaa	yeah, you should be getting it soon. the discharge is old blood, usually a dark dark red or brown; and the white gooey stuff is ovulation. it usually comes about a week before your period. i think you'll be getting it soon, so just wear panty liners from now on just in case you get it somewhere unexpected, like in class or out in public. try not to use toilet paper cause it usually rips and shreds up, and gets stuck everywhere. discharge usually comes right before your period, because its flushing all the old blood out of your system.|`|vR6AwIppaa	um why is this in beauty and style?<br>  cuz getting your period isn't so beautiful...<br>  it's really gross.<br>  yeah so trust me you don't want it.<br>  listen to lily.<br>  xx|`|fxgMwo7iaa	Wouldn't you be sticking it up your vagina and not down. And get panty liners. Idiot.|`|SCTkHr7saa	first of all...you're actually sticking toilet paper IN your vagina? you probably shouldn't do that. just start wearing a light pad to school if you're that worried and pack heavier pads in your bag just in case you do start.<br>  <br>  second of all...there is no way to tell when you're going to start your period for sure. girls get their periods at all ages. i got mine in 6th grade, my friend got hers in 3rd grade, and i have iends who still haven't had it (and they're 16). so it can really happen at any age. (having it as young as in 3rd grade is very rare, though). you're first time you'll probably have really bad cramps so that'll be a sign that you'll be starting soon. other than that, just enjoy not having it while you can. once you get it you'll wish you could go back to the good ol' days of not having one. good luck and i hope i helped!|`|oyjP2mZBaa	You absoloutely do not want to get your period.<br>  It does actually feel good to get your period because you stop worrying and wondering, but that lasts for about two days.<br>  You should seriously get pantiliners.<br>  Not pads, but the ones every female wears when they aren't on they're period. <br>  Make sure that you take a pad, some wipes, an extra pair of underwear, and an extra pair of jeans (the jeans aren't really necessary) to school in a dark bag so that people won't be able to see what's in it and you'll be prepared.<br>  Stop worrying!<br>  You will not be happy once you get the hellish cramps.<br>  Believe me.<br>  Your body will change when it wants and needs to.<br>  Good luck, and enjoy everything while you still don't get your period! (:<br>  xoxo|`|YJ3pPYCOaa	i would suggest wearing pantyliners or light pads until you do get it. and go to the bathroom if you suspect it coming. don't worry you won't be sitting there and then it comes flowing out unexpectedly. also bring extra underwear and pants if something bad does happen. also the nurse will probably have pads and tampons. don't worry about it and it wont be that bad. usually you'll see a lil red or dried blood for about a day before it comes.|`|AA11282445	Pantyliners are always a good way to help the blood not soak through your clothes. I don't know of any way to tell if you are getting your period for sure, but it depends on your body weight and hormones. Good luck.|`|gw7GoKAraa	When you first get it, it won't go through your jeans. It will feel like you peed yourself. It doesn't seep through or anything. Don't worry. You will be fine|`|HfoK9Go7aa	Don't be too paranoid about it, since you say you're getting more discharge than usual then wear panty liners in case. You can get them in the pads section anywhere.  :)|`|1E2m0kokaa	i had that for like a year before i got mine lol, and if ur afraid of getting it wear pantie liners instead of toilet paper|`|pHj3fZZmaa	you could always ask a gianacologists (a women's doctor) and they'll be able to tell u an estimate of when u'll have it. or in the meantime, just wear a pad, so that if u DO have ur period durin school, it won't show.<br>  <br>  And make sure (well ur mom will probably tell u all this) that u record it on a calender so u'll be able to know exactely when u will have ur period and don't find out the hard way that u had ur period.<br>  <br>  don't worry, I just had my period like a year ago, and i'm still gettin used to it. Lol! I even myself ask if there is something on my butt, just to be safe! lol.|`|sRBJWJXpaa	I got mine soon after I turned 14. Toilet paper will do nothing at all. While it is awkward waiting until it happens, the only thing you can do is be prepared. Have a few pads in your purse or backpack (I wouldn't recommend using tampons when you first get your period- maybe the second day). <br>  Vaginal discharge is completely normal, don't worry about, but you can try using pantyliners to save your underwear. However, if the discharge smells bad or is whitish and kind of thick, go see a doctor.
iFpyiiGsaa	HAHAHAHAHAHA
K2a3XFlFaa	yeah i agree.<br>  why would you want to?|`|24Xy8qWtaa	Why...?
fcMKOpAbaa	i wont say anything mean about your skin, i promise because i have bad skin myself.<br>  idk if this is helpful or not, but i get a rash that looks exactly like that and it spreads if i scratch it but its on my lower back. its crazy itchy if i touch or scratch it at all, but it doesn't peel, tho. for me, it seems to be triggered by hot showers. if i keep it moisturized with a good lotion (i recommend goldbond, cuz its what i use) it seems to go away, or at least stop itching.<br>  random thought: is there anything that you use specifically for your face, like soap or lotion, cuz you mighth be alergic to it (even if youve used it before, new allergies can form) <br>  good luck. if nothing else, it might be a good idea to consult a dermatologist|`|gnjdcNeKaa	My sister has this skin condition, the doctor believes it to either be eczema or an allergic reaction of some sort (she's going for tests). All I can say, is DO NOT scratch it, if puss comes out then it spreads all over the place. Go to a dermatologist and perhaps a doctor, until you do all I can think of is an allergic reaction to something or eczema. Allergies can very, depending on if you get it on your body. If you get it on your body it could be an allergic reaction to laundry detergent. If not on your body, it could be an allergic reaction to a shampoo or condition that you have recently decided to use, it could be a bad reaction to a new makeup you are using (foundation, powder etc). I suggest you ask your family members if you have a past of eczema because it quite easily could have been genetically transferred to you. Good luck!|`|2fSYZAOoaa	It might be under the skin acne but you say that it itches and acne doesn't itch. it could be an allergic reaction to something. I think that if it really bothers you then you should go see a doctor as soon as possible. In the meantime if it hurts, I reccomend advil. Hope this hlps.|`|e950526bdf44cff21f535e60251318a6aa	Dear Angel, don't mess with it yourself. There are miracle meds out there. Visit the doctor or dermatologist and get the diagnosis  and some medication, okay? You are worth it. Liz|`|AidVXkQfaa	you should add Neutrogena skin care to face and rinse in water then appy nivea cream on face <br>  <br>  it works for me!<br>  ow and do this every day before you go to sleep.|`|fMALzpv0aa	eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeewwwwwwwwwwwwwww...|`|N5oG1jmsaa	wow i think you should go and see a doctor about that <br>  it could be a rash or a reaction to somthing|`|Lkc4ozkZaa	thats the most digusting thing ive ever seen!!!!!!!!!!! tell a doctor seriously|`|LAseDHyRaa	you could be allergic to something around you|`|JQsUZiHYaa	its best if you see a doctor.. and dont worry ur still beauiful lol|`|capqMpiCaa	this is some kind of rash or skin condition. you NEED to talk to a doctor about it. 5 months? If it hasnt gone away for that long it's time to visit the doctor.|`|su37vnIXaa	its under the skin acne|`|vnKbLsQdaa	its acne underneath the skin darlin<br>  <br>  itll soon come out and you'll be able to get rid of it<br>  <br>  Try soaking cotton wall in hot water and place it their on your um spot thingys for about 5 minutes<br>  <br>  Hope this helps x|`|uAzToWC7aa	mumps, allergi reaction, rash, see a doctor asap ( :|`|Tm8qguoXaa	Are you putting anything on your face because that looks like an allergic reactin to something.|`|PRjvY6Vgaa	Hon that looks like hives. have you been using a different kind of soap lately? Because you might just be allergic to it.
aVqfgQZkaa	You don't want to try and dry up your hair, but stay away from any shampoos that emphasize moisturizing.  Continue to use conditioner, but don't overdo it.  Use just enough for it to do it's job but don't smother your hair in it.  <br>  <br>  Try not to use any products you don't need to, especially serums.  Also, dry shampoos are great for soaking up oil and giving a cleaner look without actually showering.  I'm sure they're available at other places but I know Sephora sells them in trial sizes if you want to try it out.  I'm not sure of the brand but check it out if you're interested.  I used it a while ago and it did a well enough job.|`|AILK0BTiaa	any clarifying shampoo..try biolage.. they have great products.. :o)
yUAMqWtnaa	not panic! get some extra exercise this week and be confident no one will notice! Good Luck|`|m32WmvP1aa	im not sure if there is anything you can do about it. unless you talk to the school and see if you can change what you are wearing. <br>  <br>  maybe you could get some of those high wasted underwear type things that make you look slimmer. im not sure what they are called|`|asM2jBAjaa	Eat etreamly healthy for the next week, all veggies and fruits. No sweets or sodas! <br>  Excersize daily and do toning ab workouts. <br>  <br>  good luck and i`m sure you will do fine :)
yhkEyVXLaa	I don't think so.  I think that they are a part of growing up and if you think about it, you will be happy that you got them after you have them out.  Your teeth will be in better alignment than before.<br>  <br>  If your boyfriend finds you unattractive with them, then I hate to say it but he is not the kind of boyfriend you want.  He should love you for everything about you, braces or no braces. <br>  <br>  I would just say don't worry about it.  Some people who need braces refuse to get them because they think they are ugly, when in fact those people really need them.  I'm not saying you are like that, but I definitely think you will be happy you are getting them.  You have a reason to get them, so I say work them and don't worry what others and your boyfriend think!|`|OSD5by7Oaa	yes|`|yXGlmUqlaa	they're not the hottest things in the world but they're normal.<br>  alot of people go through having braces now and because it's a normal thing now people just look past.<br>  i wouldn't worry too much, the results are worth it. plus if your boyfriend finds you unattractive because of something like braces then he's not worth it.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|F0LgeWs5aa	Keep you eye on the prize!!! When they come off you will have a Beautiful smile. But don't wait until then  Smile with them in so you get allot of practice.<br>  My dentist is old like me and had braces @4? <br>  Yes I think braces are attractive. it shows personal pride in how people see you.|`|gV9KgNctaa	no i wanted braces for the longest time i thought they were cool haha|`|Ohn0oRSfaa	u can makeout better|`|0bSUVWENaa	it is alright girl because even if you do have them and he sees you he will still think you are attractive because if he was really your boyfriend he will like you for you and i think wearing braces does not even make you unattractive because they are just on your teeth.|`|AA10499839	Get invisalign better than braces, I have had them for 1 year and no one knows I have them unless I tell them.

fd86a2638e2a47fa0b12005b94499a32aa	As long as it's done by a professional you're fine – a lot of people get their ears done with guns, which work by work by blunt force trauma so can cause a lot of damage to your ear. Guns can’t be sterilized which means that as well as risking the piercing getting infected you’re also at risk of pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis A, B, and C. You’re also more prone to allergic reaction because the jewelry used when pierced with a gun isn’t appropriate. Basically if a person uses a gun they are not a piercer, thus they will have no idea how to pierce correctly, avoid infection or other health risks or be able to help you if the piercing goes wrong. Make sure you go to a professional who uses a needle and correct jewelry, they should be clean and wearing gloves, use fresh and clean jewelry and equipment and their studio should look like the inside of a hospital room. <br>  <br>  If you don’t go to a professional then it may hurt, a normal piercing will feel like a pinch and a pulling on your skin, no big deal, but if done incorrectly such as with a gun it can be more painful. Professionals will also have solutions that they can use on your skin to numb it so you don’t feel any pain at all. The only real thing that could cause pain is if it gets infected afterwards, again if you go to a professional there won’t be a problem and they can advise you how to best look after your piercing. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_piercing" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_pierci...</a><br>  <a href="http://tattoo.about.com/cs/psafety/a/piercing_guns.htm" rel="nofollow">http://tattoo.about.com/cs/psafety/a/pie...</a>|`|yo30g3pPaa	Depends on your pain tolerance.<br>  My 11 year old brother got his ear pierced and he didnt flinch<br>  the four year old before him didn't even notice that the lasy pierced it.<br>  I was only 4 months when I got mine done so I don't remember<br>  Don't be nervous. good luckk|`|yXGlmUqlaa	no.<br>  it's a quick pinch and it's done<br>  <br>  they are a little sore afterwards, but nothing big|`|NTEuxMVmaa	It hurts for a little while,but it's worth doing.|`|zYVCJRMXaa	nope slight pinch thats it. May throb a bit after but nothing bad.|`|tnUhxfjlaa	nope, not at all|`|v0l1JEloaa	It depends.  My mom said when she got hers done as a kid, that hers didn't hurt.  But mine sure did! If you're really worried, you can hold an ice cube on each ear before they pierce it to numb it.  My mom should have let me do that before I got mine done.  Good luck! Find some really cute earrings to get your mind off the whole thing.  You have to wear the ones they pierce them with for 6 weeks and put this cleaner stuff on your ears to prevent them from being infected.  You cannot take the earrings out until the 6 weeks are up.|`|Qa0sXoqqaa	Hey Sweetie,<br>  <br>  No, it doesn't hurt at all. If you are really worried, put some Ice Cubes on your ear before, so they go numb, then that reduces any pain. It doesn't hurt at all, I don't remember it hurting, anyway. I had mine done when I was 6, one closed, so i had that re-pierced again at 11. Didn't hurt at all. I have a triple helix piercing, which is the cartilage at the top of your ear. That hurts way more than your lobes, and for me, it barely hurt. So, don't be worried. Its worth it, anyway!<br>  <br>  x<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  (L)|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	Yes but only for a little while. To help with the pain use teething lotion on your ears first to desensitize them and ice to numb them. Worked for me! Have fun and God Bless, Velle T|`|AA12221820	NO NOT AT ALL..IT JUST FEELS LIKE A LIL ANT STING AND IT WILL GO AWAY LIKE IN 10 MINZ BUT U HAVE 2 APPLY ICE ND IT WILL FELL SO MUCH BETTER..|`|uCxYdyQXaa	No, not really.

Zjb4p1TRaa	It fades over time, keep washing it but be careful because it can wash away all the good nutrients in your hair.<br>  <br>  You could try one of those wash in -wash out hair dyes that last for like 3 washes. It might not work, but it might too.<br>  Good luck.|`|UjC2vaqLaa	shave it
m32WmvP1aa	very hot dress<br>  if you are wearing it to something like.. prom then it needs to be long. i like the long look of it <br>  <br>  however if you are wearing it to a party then you should definetly wear it short, or if you are going to a school dance or something of the sorts.|`|sPtRjRBEaa	Heloo<br>  <br>  Its up to you which one you want to wear . I know people have said that the short one looks slutty but you sound like your going to a party am I correct so why not wear it short. I think it looks alot nicer and thats what young girls tend to wear.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  Good Luck and have fun at the party :]|`|aMwQGhYyaa	the long one is very classy and would make you look more beautiful...but ultimately it depends where you are going. the long long one could make you seem overdressed...|`|yXGlmUqlaa	depends where you are wearing it.<br>  <br>  think of how it will look most appropiate for the occasion|`|3k2NjOWsaa	I like the shorter one to tell you the truth.  just carry around a can of pepper spray and a baseball bat to keep the bastards off of you.  it's definiately sassier shorter|`|Oejricveaa	I would wear it long. That is a very pretty dress and the shorter version makes it look trashy and takes the beauty from the dress.|`|6a9AfhsLaa	I like it better long; its a bit classier. but it really depends on the occasion. I love the dress, though.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	the short looks very slutty.  If you're a slut go for that one.

AA11940634	Yes, it will. All piercings leave some scar. If you don't let it heal, the scar wont be bad, but there will probably still be a scar. But it's still a severe type of skin damage.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	yes it will|`|yo30g3pPaa	Maybe, but it wouldn't be that noticible.<br>  but i mean do you stare at people's eyebrows looking for a scar? nooo(:<br>  <br>  haha good luckk|`|2ZsRAxkuaa	A scar? Probably.<br>  If it rejects, it'll be larger the longer you leave it.<br>  I tried to save mine and failed, and I have a scar.<br>  Though 2 years later, and its much much unoticable.|`|5y38Pdtiaa	yes, a scar<br>  had one like 13yrs ago. still have scar|`|ZARozVAHaa	yes it will it will look like a black head that you can never pop
2uZivThaaa	Yes it does. Because what your scalp is trying  to do is moisturize your hair because all the natural oils are being washed out. Its suggested that you wash your hair every other day. I used to wash my hair once or twice a day and my hair was always greasy by the end of the day. My friend who is a hair stylist suggested that I was my hair every other day maybe even more than that. So started doing that, just washing my ONLY my bangs if they looked greasy. Doing this will make your scalp produce the normal amount of oils you need without over doing it. Now my hair is super healthy and soft, and it is never greasy!|`|AA11456147	no, mine gets greasy when i dont wash it!!|`|6a9AfhsLaa	That can really damage your hair.It dries it out and strips it of all nutrients. If you wash it like a maniac, then stop for a day or two, it will seem that way because you are so used to washing to so much.. But it is absolutely horrible for your hair. You should do it every other day, everyday if you have to, but to keep those nutrients to keep it from being damaged, esp. if you use a hairdryer, go with e. o. day.

Let's say get everyone's favorite flower and have them tattooed somewhere on your body.  <br>  <br>  I think the best thing to do would be to spend time with them and think about it.  It will come to you.|`|xuV1xsImaa	You should do a Tree to represent the Generations.|`|pd5rERcfaa	Do you like flowers?  You could always do a tattoo of three flowers on a single vine or something, maybe one in each of their favorite colors.  If you wanted to do something astrological you could do planets, each one of their sun signs.  There are really a thousand options, but since this is such a personal choice make sure its something that works for you.  Talk with your tattoo artist, maybe they can help you come up with some thing you really love.

( ;*(**|`|Ivg9nEDVaa	Usually black and brown don't go well together even if they are isolated by a blue sweeter, or they are the only colors you are wearing.  Change the brown top for something black.  The clothes you've shown seem like something you'd wear for church, an awards ceremony for someone you're supporting or a business event.  The hair looks like it will complement you well.

ms82j4iaaa	try garnier fructis surfer wax. it comes in a little round plastic jar kinda thing. i have blonde hair, and i put it in my hair when it's wet then blow dry it. it makes it easy to style. don't use too much though, that's when it could make your hair look dirty. just like swipe the top of your index finger in it and rub it together in your hands which kind of heats it up and makes it easier to apply and then put all over in your hair and then blow dry. that's what i do at least.
hMY5HDlIaa	I'm pretty sure that you can curl it. The treatment only makes your hair straight. It doesn't prevent your from curling it (:|`|cGNK9uD5aa	probably but it would be like dead straight hair do it would take work and my sister said idk if its true that her friend got that and she went in the water and she let it dry and it was completely straight like before. which is guessing to happen since it stays on for like 4-6 months and u have to eventually wash ur hair during that time period which is totally kick ***

You could search Macys, Forever 21, and possibly Hollister. I know that Hollister is a brand name store and you may not think that you could find a shirt like that, but trust me, If you search you may find a shirt similar. These tops are basically named Boho Tops. Search in your local stores for Boho Tops.|`|WpPeydNaaa	it is cute!<br>  i wouldnt wear it but it would look good on other people<br>  and try forever 21<br>  they usually have lots like that or wet seal|`|3xvGhscFaa	LOVE IT!! whered u get it??|`|Ng93U5Taaa	yeah that is totally cute!!

AA12367392	You can buy these things that look like miniture pool noodles, you wrap your hair around them when your hair is wet or you can do it dry and sleep on it they are made of really soft stuff like foam and they will give you like ringlets depending on which way you put the things, experiment at home until you get the look you like and then you can do it whenever the need arises, hope this helps, goodluck! :)

g9F2vIi0aa	both of those pics don't have highlights or streaks... the second one has a patch of blonde (a thick streak) at her fringe... but the first girl is an all over colour...<br>  <br>  so they both wouldn't have that effect... highlights look crap anyway coz they always look like they're growing out... and streaks lighten your hair but they'd have to be thin ones... and it's like impossible to keep the initial look more than once, like getting it redone, it wouldn't look as good as the first time.<br>  <br>  so i suggest taking in the photo and the hairdressers will show you the different types of dyes there are. and remember with hair dyeing that if you don't like the colour it usually takes about a week for the dye to settle into your hair and also for you to adjust to it... so don't worry if you don't like immediatley...|`|Bf7bj9asaa	Well, i think streaks are just like thicker and more noticeable, and then highlights are smaller streaks? like but a lot of them. Well, print it out and show it to your stylist, thats what i did to get that haircut, i still have it now lol. Uh, i dont understand what you mean with your second question lol.|`|UaOB9edEaa	highlights are are lighter than your base color(if you want piece of hair darker than your base color they're called llow lights and thin piece of hair.

The best way to get curly hair is to divide ur hair into 4 equal parts and distribute the gel evenly and alot. u can also us a diffuser on your blowdryer.|`|3PO45ncPaa	ok, take some agave nectar or honey if you dont have it and soak your hair in it ( the natural sugars will soak in your hair. this will not make it sticky, it will just create a natural healthyness in your hair so when you curl it it will curl easily) after you rinse the honey out (before you curl it) spray leave in conditioner (preferably John Frida frizz ease brand) and then wash your hair again (but no shampoo or conditioner, just water) then spray the conditioner in again and dry it and curl it!<br>  <br>  It worked for me!|`|8Njdzwi0aa	I have the same hair problem. Buy a 1 inch good quality hair straightener and curl it with that. You will get the exact same curls in the picture.

This will sort of stunt your growth, so don't worry to much about being a little overweight at this age.  I was about 160 pounds when I went into high school, about 5'6" tall, and kinda chubby.  When I left high school, I had put over 4,000 miles on my bicycle, and was 6'2" and about 180 pounds.<br>  <br>  Some kids probably thought I looked hot.

If I was just talking with someone at a party, I would never guess the difference.  <br>  <br>  Still, you'll know what's in your ring, and if you are not certain between the two, I recommend picking the one that makes you happier, even if it is a little bit happier.

VgZ20wMlaa	Talk to her...... before giving the money... serious talk..........<br>  <br>  tell her how she doesnt give you money back when she "borrows"<br>  <br>  Best of luck|`|8HPdqHTSaa	I go clothes shopping 3 times a year or less too, and I get only a shirt or two. And I'm upper-middle class. Not all of us are spoiled to death like people I know. 13 also.<br>  Hide the money, and I wouldn't ask in this catagory again.|`|6uzQB9OYaa	if ur mom can't pay the rent or phone bill then you could get in serious trouble. be generous and give her the money for both of ur sakes!!!! and if ur really tight on money and want to go shopping i suggest you take up baby sitting or another job you could do around your neighborhood so you can buy some clothes and save some money. when and if you give the money you got for ur bday 2 ur mom remind her that this is the LAST time u r giving her money and that she needs to make money for herself cuz she's the parent. and if she asks for money again remind her what u said and say that you meant it. she's supposed to be paying the phone bill not you. so yes, get a job like baby sitting (after school and on weekends are good times) and save the money!! then you can go shopping and do what u want to do with it, which doesn't include giving it to your mom.|`|J1UgdK2raa	Talk to her and tell her it doesn't make sense. It's your money. Ask her how she'd feel if she had $200 and you said; "Okay, I'll borrow this money, but not pay you back."<br>  <br>  If nothing works, SPEND IT QUICK. XD [or leave it with a trustable friend and say you already had someone else borrow the money]|`|nl2aIBhgaa	I think you should help your mother out.shes there for you and your there for her. and if you wat money then you should start applying for a job once you turn 14, thats what im doing.. im turning 14 on the 17th of march and then around march break im going to apply for jobs.|`|QMbxBynZaa	my mom and dad do the exact same thing, but with bigger amounts of money like a few hundred, almost a thousand sometimes. btw im only fifteen and im pretty much in the same sitch as you. tell your mom that you cant just go handing out money even if it is to her, and tell her she has to pay you back or else what is she teaching you ? to steal your kids money ? defff talk to her and tell her its your money.. also i hide my money alot, lik e i put it in my piggy bank and dont talk about it and if she asks to borrow money i tell her i dont have any cause i spent it at school or a foot ball game or something.|`|ogeRU7KEaa	If you don't give your mom the money you won't have any place to live. You're 13 years old you don't need money. Also, going shopping 4 times a year is a lot. You should be grateful for what you have because their are people that are a lot less fortunate than you. You should be happy that your mom provides food, shelter, and clothing for you. Some kids out there would kill for that. Okay, I'm going to stop now before I start ranting. I just really hate when people are ungrateful.|`|idVEFa68aa	i get what you mean when you say you love her and i know it isn't fair but i think you should help out your mom. maybe not the whole 100 but chip in a little. with me being the clothes freak i am i know it must be hard only going a few times a year. still just a 50 can at the very least get you a shirt or two.|`|CX2DVAnVaa	that happened to me and my om hunted my money down and took it out of my drawer get a good spot to hide it and talk to her about it I still <3 my mom it just really gets on my nerves when she "borrows" it.....I talked to my mom and now she doesnt do that|`|56ud0sGmaa	i think u should tell her about how u would like some money too. tell her to be a little more careful with the phone and just let her borrow like at least $50 and tell her to please whens he gets da money and when she can to please pay u back...be really sweet about it i think she'll understand|`|K6egI6O4aa	Talk to her about how you feel!<br>  <br>  BTW- Shopping four times a year should be more than enough. If you want money maybe you should try working for it. Babysit, do yard work for a neighbor, or try to help your mom around the house.|`|4iHBjNizaa	you should probably give it to her- she has already "paid you" a lot of money just by providing food and shelter.|`|zpbKit6Uaa	talk to her shes your mom!|`|ZxKLOqAlaa	Let's see, clothes... or rent? This is a tough one. <br>  <br>  NO. Don't hide the money. Your mom doesn't have enough money to pay the rent, and you're worried you won't have spending cash? Seriously. This is the real world, money isn't going to magically appear for your mom.<br>  <br>  Besides, who NEEDS to go shopping all the time? I have to buy my own clothes too. I don't have babysitting opportunities or anything like that, so 4 times a year is the most I go too. Please, stop feeling sorry for yourself and be happy that you're not starving in Africa.<br>  <br>  Does she have a steady job? If she does, then sit down with her and, judging from her paycheck, decide how she is going to pay you back. For instance (just a random example), if she recieves $200 a month, and you need to pay $100 for the rent and $50 for food, have her pay you $25 dollars. And do this every month until she has paid you your $150.

I let my mom try too but tweezing just plain hurt too much! I knew if waxing your legs and bikini areas felt like someone ripping the skin right off my body I damn sure wasn't going to try it on my eyebrows!! Now here comes the crazy part...I shaved them into shape! Yea! You have to be very careful,very precise,and have a steady hand oh and of course a sharp razor(I prefer using a venus disposable). Works like a charm and doesn't hurt at all! You may have to practice the first couple of times(this is when an eyebrow pencil handy) but soon it will be second nature. Trust me it works!!!|`|xXfkyPBCaa	go to a beauty salon as you can ask for an eyebrow reshape.  Or you could attemp to pluck them into shape you self using tweezers!!!, not always the best way to go though.|`|nhiUPSznaa	i used to have really bad shaped eyebrow but now i do threading its really fast and its like 8 to 10 dollars. give it a shot|`|Jooxd04Caa	Threading or waxing are the best options.
uQfk8p7Laa	all piercing hurts it depends on what you are getting done cause some are more painful then others!  cartilage don't really hurt that much it just depends if your cartilage is thick or thin? thick cartilage don't hurt as much as a thin cartilage cause really there isn't alot of cartilage there! well honestly some piercings take care of there self like the tragus, nose, tongue, navel, and so forth! it just brings tears to your eyes really from what people told me i don't have one and i will never get one! <br>  some don't need to be cleaned cause your body does it for you! <br>  plus as long as you do that is at the bottom you should be fine! <br>     1.  Wash your hands with antibacterial soap.<br>     2. Wet the piercing with plain water.<br>     3. Put a few drops of antibacterial soap on the piercing and work them into a lather with a cotton bud.<br>     4. Try to loosen any crusted discharge and float it off the jewelry and your skin with the cotton bud.<br>     5. Leave the antibacterial soap on the piercing for two minutes while rotating the jewelry back and forth, allowing the disinfectant to penetrate the piercing.<br>     6. Rinse with water and air dry thoroughly. Do not dry with a towel, which may carry bacteria.|`|4hzPCxmyaa	Normal cartilage piercings really aren't that painful. I have one in each ear, and three lobe piercings. I psyched myself out, thinking that it was really going to hurt. The first one, I didn't even feel. I thought they missed. Then they both felt really hot. Not burning, but just like someone held a blow dryer right by my ears. After about a week, I could sleep on that side again. But they can get infected pretty easily: shampoo, hair products etc... Make sure you clean them properly.<br>  <br>  The part about cartilage piercings that is painful is making sure that your hair doesn't get tangled in them and you don't snag your shirt on it. That hurts! A lot.<br>  <br>  I don't have a nose piercing, but a lot of people in my school do. Basically, it makes your eyes water, and that's it. If you clean it, it's highly unlikely that it will get infected.|`|pb7qPJcxaa	Don't get both cartilages pierced at the same time.  Do one and when it heals do the other.  The healing process is slower than regular and it hurts.  You never realize til you talk on the phone or sleep on your side.<br>  <br>  I let all my piercings on the cartilages heal cause it was too painful to use the phone at work.|`|Vnj95hFTaa	I've had my nose pierced three times now haha. It really doesn't hurt at all to me but everyone is different. If you want it bad enough you'll get it. It's only temporary pain for something that you will have forever. None of my piercings have gotten infected. Just take care of it.|`|knVEqj5aaa	Ears don't hurt at all.. Cartelidge takes longer to heal though.<br>  <br>  Nose has the same affect as when you brush your hair too hard, your sinuses get all tingly.. not pleasant.<br>  <br>  I love my nose ring but it's very annoying when I'm sick.

3Hj5Vu5maa	As much as I love blonde hair (I am a blonde). Pale blonde typically goes better with light eyes and fair skin. Since you have brown eyes I would recommend a raven black (with blueish tint) or a dirty blonde with darker underneath (a.k.a. a peek-a-boo). If you are planning on dying your hair yourself do not go lighter. You may end up making your hair orange or yellow. Instead go to a salon. I would recommendgoing to a salon and getting their advice. They can give you advice on what looks good with your skin tone/face shape/hair texture/etc...I love your haircut by the way!<br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|v6mQzSSbaa	Blonde|`|kltRWD81aa	Well personally I like the black.

r0kUT6IRaa	I have used this 19 times and my hair is soo much blonder so yes it works
cDyWTRhuaa	I have used it about 2 times in the last year. I was really satisfied with how long it would stay in and the amazing color! I naturally have dark brown hair, but I tried this and my hair came out carmel color!( my perfect color!) The texture will also change, making your hair soft and shiny. It was a perfect match to the colour samples on the box and it was totally natural looking! <br>  <br>  I recommend using Herbal Essences products for shiny and smooth hair. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.herbalessences.com/us/hair-care-products/" rel="nofollow">http://www.herbalessences.com/us/hair-ca...</a>|`|YP97SU3Maa	I have used it several times and have always been very satisfied with the results.

If your hair is not curly to begin with it makes it even harder to keep the curls springy. Not to mention if you havent gotten your hair cut in a while, or if you have long hair it also makes it harder to have nice curls. Get a cut to trim the dead ends, and maybe shorten the length. Try the curling balm from Redken and make sure to use a diffuser when you use the hair dryer.

HaNMN21Paa	Try a deep conditioner or hot oil treatment. These always make my hair softer, manageable, and less tangled, but it is temporary.|`|FyWvDqYraa	I had the exact same problem. I looked like a freaking monster with curly hair, so I straightened my everyday and I regret that. My hair fell out so much.. I thought I was malting.. like going bald. Luckily I went to my hairdresser and I keep going back there to cut my split ends off and she also gave me this conditioner thing. <br>  <br>  It's a chinese product and its black and smells a bit off.. but it works a treat. Wash your hair, as normal but replace this with your conditioner and leave it in for 10 minutes. It softens your hair, makes it less boofy and it helps your hair to grow back quickly. I kid you not, my hair grew back to normal within 4 weeks.<br>  <br>  Only problem is, the whole packet is in chinese so I have no idea what it's called. You might want to ask around your hairdressers to get it because it is absolutely worth it. Theres another product that is similar to it so you might want to google it or something.<br>  :)|`|kXURogD7aa	condition it A LOT!<br>  <br>  my hair has been bleached over 5 times in the past year. <br>  <br>  it really damaged it. <br>  <br>  now, i use pantene pro-v smooth lisses conditioner. every time i wash my hair<br>  <br>  but, once a week i let it sit for about 10-20 minutes . <br>  <br>  after one use, my hair is soft and smooth for a week- 2 weeks. <br>  <br>  i'm not getting paid to write this, i have never had any conditioner that works this good.
JCG36VRVaa	yes they do shift a lil after you get it pierced<br>  <br>  dont worry its normal<br>  <br>  just SLIGHTLY and GENTLY nudge it to the right side it shud be on<br>  <br>  it shud even out evetually<br>  <br>  have fun!!|`|tnUhxfjlaa	holy crap that crooked, i would wait a couple of weeks and if it hasn't straightened out then it would be a good idea to put in a 12g, i know it sounds weird, but the weight of a bigger piece of jewelry will straighten the hole, then you can put the 14g back in
s4psKJrPaa	ya, mineral foundation is good. bare minerals is pretty expensive though. im 13, i use loreal mineral powder foundation, most people cant tell im even wearing foundation, but i helps and doesnt make me break out or anything :). as for eyeliner, get a charcoal or black brown color, black blacks look trashy and unnatural. revlon colorstay pencil is good :). hope i helped!<br>  <br>  mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306183423AAvaLHR">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|zwpJCdrJaa	OK for foundation get the maybeline bare minerals that's not the name of it but i can't remember it right now.

If your skin is dry, you should use an exfoliating cream; if is is oily, find a cleansing product that works well and doesn't irritate it. <br>  <br>  Either way, if you are going to use foundation, use a light foundation with SPF (to protect your skin from sun damage that will speed up the aging process). <br>  <br>  I personally prefer Bobbi Brown products; I've tried several including Clinique, Estee Lauder, and MAC. I personally have not used bare minerals, but I've heard it's pretty expensive compared to other brands. Stay away from cheap drug store makeup (Loreal, Maybelline, etc.) because it might irritate your skin. <br>  <br>  The foundation I use is Bobbi Brown Skin Foundation SPF 15. There are tons of shades, and I was actually able to find one that fit my skin perfectly, which never happens with other brands I have tried. It also hydrates and protects your skin and lasts for a long time, but it comes off pretty easily. It also looks light and fresh, doesn't cake on, and you don't have to put powder on over it. <br>  <br>  As for the eyeliner, I would use it sparingly, especially if you've never worn makeup before. If you have darker eyes, hair, eyelashes, and skin tone, go with black. However, if you are more fair, have light eyes (blue, green), or have blonde hair, use a brown. <br>  <br>  If you are going to use eyeliner, it often looks weird without mascara unless you have extra long eyelashes. However, you can easily pull off mascara without eyeliner. It totally depends on the look you are going for.<br>  <br>  For makeup removal, I use Pond's Clean Sweep wipes. The remove even waterproof makeup easily and are very convenient.<br>  <br>  As for prices, decent brands are obviously more expensive than drug store brands, but they are worth it. The foundation I have costs $45 for 1 fluid oz., which sounds expensive, but it lasts forever! Other makeup products are relatively cheap, between $5 and $25. The makeup removal wipes cost about $5 for 30 wipes, which last a long time.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

Zx1LrNrCaa	It's best to wait until after tanning, because shaving removes the protective layer of dead skin and would leave your legs prone to burning. But if you already have a good base tan, it won't matter.|`|rvtktabkaa	It's the same for both i'm pretty sure. Because both ways it's better if your legs aren't hairy so that the tan can be distributed evenly.|`|AFDTLXH4aa	yes definently!|`|yVdW756Gaa	Yes you should|`|e4eB4gK1aa	Yes.  I worked in a tanning salon over 5 years. Reason being, when you shave your legs your also shedding skin cells.  The same skin cells you paid top dollar to tan.  You should also wait at least 5 to 6 hours to shower after you go tanning.|`|iN99x7OGaa	oh definitly when you get a tan hair on your legs and arms can interfere with the tan|`|RSOJfVwmaa	just shave them...|`|es3feuhxaa	shave them the night before you go|`|nsx7FfDkaa	no, it doesn't matter.

XXiKMBWJaa	Blonder. Definitely. But I wouldn't do to light a blonde it wouldn't match your facial features/skin color. And layers.Your Hair wa meant to be done with layers.

YQPulpK4aa	vintage and cheap don't usually work together... unless you get lucky at a thrift store. Browse those. As for no internet shopping, that severely limits you!!! Though you can look online and see if there are any local stores.<br>  I just bought a really cute dress at sears (believe it or not) that was kind of vintage and had a sweethear neckline and was $8.99 clearance from $70. Not too formal though. More everyday.

ZfI3lqVjaa	I definitely think you should go for it!<br>  Your skin tone and eye color would go great with a red hue added to it. <br>  I disagree with the person above, i think the bangs would look awesome on you.<br>  <br>  I wanted to dye my hair purple, maybe streaks but i thought that wasn't original.

mysX3btqaa	If you're not breastfeeding, your skin doctor may prescribe tretinoin cream (brand name Retin-A), alone or in combining with other creams. A couple of studies have shown that applying tretinoin cream may help with stretch marks.|`|f39bb7e67117f442a6630c6d09215570aa	There is a lot of stretch mark treatment available on the market these days. Some treatments are more effective in fading or even eliminating stretch marks, but the success of the treatment depends on a few different things. First of all is the color and age of the stretch marks. If they have faded to a flesh color they are much harder to heal. Second of all, ethnicity and heredity play a role in which creams, oils and other products or equipment will succeed in healing stretch marks. <br>  <br>  The cheapest stretch mark treatment available is creams made especially for stretch marks. The most effective creams contain ingredients such as cocoa butter, lanolin and wheat germ oil. These creams actually heal and rebuild the damaged skin. While they may not be able to completely eliminate stretch marks, they may at least make the stretch marks fade to a barely visible scar. A good recommendation will be Palmer Cocoa Butter Cream.<br>  <br>  Another popular & effective cream that you might wish to consider is Strivectin. It has a bioactive topical formula that has a combination of skin firming agents to reduce visible wrinkles and make skin appear firmer<br>  <br>  If you are interested in more effective ways of getting rid of stretch marks, you can read abt them from this site: <a href="http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.com/" rel="nofollow">http://stretch-marks.my-fashion-house.co...</a>|`|XVz47i85aa	I have them and basically just toning up your muscles seems to work.  Put the cocoa butter on before you sleep too.  Mine are barely noticeable now.  Good luck:D|`|Vby0WLkGaa	Ur best bet is to continue using the cocoa lotion to prevent them worsening. i havent found anything to rid of them tho sry.
oii2QAlAaa	Most of the time that I have gotten my hair hairlighted or dyed the stylist will wash out the color blowdry it then straighten it and maybe curl it at the ends to give alittle more natural look.  Hope this answers your question.  By the way after you get you hair dyed don't wash until the next night so the color can stay in your hair as long as possible and ask your stylist which shampoo and conditioner you should use so that the color will last.|`|N6cuuDAmaa	Yes its fine... but even if you don't have your hair dyed you need to get this spray that will protect your hair when you straighten it...|`|Gd2zv86haa	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  Once your hair is all dry (which it should be by the time you leave the salon) You can carry on styling your hair as usual.|`|cwsYM2F4aa	Do you mean chemically straighten it (i.e. reverse perm or relaxer)?  If so, I don't recommend it.  For one thing, he/she won't do it the same day.  You will have to wait a couple of weeks.  But please don't do it.  I used to get my hair highlighted and then get a reverse perm.  It's taken me more than nine months to get my hair back into decent shape, using weekly, multiple deep conditioning treatments.  Getting your hair colored will be hard enough on your hair.  Straightening it on top of that will absolutely wreck it.  <br>  <br>  If you mean you just want him/her to straighten it with a flat iron that day, they will do that.  Occasional use of flat ironing is okay, but be sure to use a thermal protection product on your hair first.  It really helps minimize the damage.|`|VhrUtQc2aa	it's alright to straighten it You want to walk out look pretty not looking like your coming out of the shower lol joking|`|CoACAmkRaa	Yep.<br>  My stylist does it every time.|`|qp8y4Hs5aa	yes its safe, but try not to do it everyday, and when you dont have anywhere to go during the day dont blow dry your hair either. the heat can damage your hair, especially since you are putting chemicals in it. using a straightener, blow dryer, curling iron on your hair everyday AND dying it will cause your hair to fry...and that is no fun.<br>  just be careful :)|`|HfscWZRQaa	well i am a guy and i straighten my hair<br>  <br>  <br>  i say get it dyed<br>  <br>  <br>  wait a day<br>  <br>  then after that day, straighten it yourself or ask someone<br>  <br>  <br>  or possibly go back to the solon but that really shouldnt be nessicarry<br>  <br>  <br>  the solon person might strighten it before it gets died<br>  <br>  <br>  so dont really worry|`|78z7gk7naa	A course! :] Just use a heat protection serum before straightening and use damaged hair [even if not damaged] shampoo and conditioner [for a few days after the dyeing] and your hair will be fine!|`|wCb0LkmJaa	yeah ive done it.<br>  i had to get my<br>  hair straightened in<br>  order to get it dyed|`|VSiMrZkOaa	Yea I do it, and nothing as happened|`|JCWyncrHaa	yeah it fine|`|gGmvFSV7aa	i have done it and it's been fine.

But now it's considered tough.|`|zfD0NX5oaa	b/c it's feminine. it is meant to accentuate the beauty of the female body. guys usually have hairy or rock hard stomachs.

sQGQWCnNaa	hmmmm... well i use clinique 3-step system and they have like, customized kinds (number 1-4). since you have oily skin, i think you'd be number 4. so just go to a clinique counter and ask for the three step system. it's simple, and works so well! it can take a while for it to kick in, but after you use it (and continue using it everyday. and i mean everyday. you'll regret it if you skip a day) you'll never see any imperfections ever again. it's just cleanse, tone, and moisturize! simple simple..<br>  as for the shower, yeah it does matter. the oil left from your workout will clog your pores, which is probably why you have the big inflamed pimples. my advice is to use baby wipes (yeah sounds stupid.. hehe) but yeah, wipe your face with baby wipes after every gym period and it should get rid of the oil.<br>  good luck! :)|`|7tnb4On2aa	A prescription for tretinoin applied nightly, and you should notice significant clearing in 2-3 months.

a2ol5COXaa	you can change it up :)<br>  <br>  i have naturally straightish hair.<br>  <br>  because your hair is curly, you can go and scrunch your hair some days.<br>  i recommend using styling gel, and Aussie sprunch spray. i love it !<br>  <br>  <br>  and when you straighten it, you can always tease it a little at the yop, and put a headband in. (kind of like this, but with your hair down, and a little less teased if you want: <a href="http://www.healthandbeauty.net.au/images/hilary-duff11.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthandbeauty.net.au/images...</a> , <a href="http://images.teamsugar.com/files/users/2/20652/38_2007/TeasingHair.jpg)" rel="nofollow">http://images.teamsugar.com/files/users/...</a><br>  <br>  or, you could get a new haircut, with sidebangs or normal bangs :)<br>  <br>  <br>  hope this helped!|`|CM61dGawaa	braid it <br>  wavys look nice and simple|`|ZVg7xVHwaa	maybe a new different unique haircut!|`|FnWmRL85aa	Your hair sounds so much like mine!

LKlQkElAaa	looks like your friend's got a hairy situation going on<br>  lol<br>  i see that the situation is that her skin is light, yet her hair is dark black. I personally had a situation like this. What i did, i bought this lotion that tints the hairs to a blondish color. you apply it just like a lotion and the hairs turn to the color of your skin in about an hour. The product does sting a little at first, but it is well worth is. Afterwards, you cant see hair because it evens out with your skin color. i use it in my arms and legs.<br>  I cant really remember at the moment what it is called, but i got it at Walmart in the beauty supply section. it is like $12.|`|K6egI6O4aa	My sis had the same problem so for her wedding she used Nair.

lbqZ05KBaa	I went to Wal-Mart and git this ionic blow dryer with a round brush on the end.  I let my hair air dry into all of its natural frizzy curliness and take that blow dryer- with my hair in sections I straighten it.  It costs only like $13.00 and it makes my hair shiny and soft.  The other thing you could do is use a hair lotion and the ionic blow dryer.|`|37WQ3LKFaa	You must have frizzy curly hair like me. I am 15 and looking good at high school is very important. I understand. So i use Aussie and nextus hair products plus a straightener. There is not a shampoo out there that will automatically straighten your hair. Definitely use a good straightener, Mine is called HAI. Works awesome> Good luck.|`|lAQRpH2Iaa	do you have a straightener? if so you need a treatment to help fight frizz and something to help straighten it while using the iron. i know you are only 13 but talk to your mother and tell her how you are feeling about your hair and try to make an app. with someone who has curly hair to give you a Great cut. You really need to use good products so if you want them bad enough then see if you can do something for your mom to help out and maybe you can get an allowance for it. Try Redken Iron silk you Spray it on every section and comb through before you straighten(on dry hair)

NBofJIeLaa	Go to the Levi's store. They have pretty much all of their different fits and cuts and washes there. But on the downside, they're a bit expensive so look for them on sale!
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	Right after you get out of the shower put a little conditioner back into your hair, until it feels like wet silk. Then scrunch some gel (LA Looks sport gel is good) into your hair with your hands. Scrunch some of the water out with a t-shirt, and let it air dry without messing with it. If your hair is crunchy once it has dried, just scrunch out the texture with a little aloe vera gel for defined, healthy curls. I hope this helps!|`|81tlBAwIaa	Get your hair thinned, then chemically straighten it.|`|Apqri7Tfaa	My hair used to be really puffy. Make sure you use conditioner and maybe use a bit of product like hair serum or mousse. Adding a little bit of oil to the hair makes it less puffy. Also, try blow-drying it with a diffuser. Or you could get a really short cut, that would eliminate puffiness.
nWP3zCBIaa	Can you curl you hair maybe? Or even just straighten it and apply a clip on the side. You can find smallish black bows that will go with you outfit and not look to tacky, you just need to find a nice one. Not a crappy $2 plastic one.<br>  Also, the dress sounds nice . Don't wear any facial rings, wear you earrings though, or just a few if you have multiple piercing their. Maybe just wear studs, plain silver or ones with a stone. They don't need to be good earrings, just nice-looking ones. <br>  Wear the coat and then some cute black or silver ballet flats or heels, pumps would be best if your wearing heels. <br>  Good luck :)|`|VcGnf0WMaa	I'm not sure and I'm not a fashion freak but that combo sound kind of hot to me you should do that.I know you would look awesome in that go for it.
v67Z1rczaa	My favorite is Young, Fabulous and Broke, BCBG, Alice + Olivia, Chip & Pepper, Marc Jacobs, DKNY, 7 For All Mankind, Anna Sui, Stella McCartney, YSL, Zac Posen (more on the expensive side), Diane Von Furstenberg, Twelfth St. by Cynthia, True Religion, Adam and Eve Clothing, C&C California, Daughters of the Revolution, Free People, Haute Hippie, Rich & Skinny<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a little!
VenYUtH6aa	The thing about American Apparel is that everything is pretty much pre-shrunk so you won't be able to get it much smaller. <br>  The only thing you can really do is wash it in HOT water.<br>  Every time you need to wash it, put the cycle on HOT and eventually it may shrink down.<br>  <br>  I do this with their hoodies cause XS is a little snug but S is a little big.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)<br>  Good luck!
Jpgz4mSVaa	laughter makes you live longer! don't change a thing!|`|ojwRgCLqaa	Think of something sad or serious. Then smile afterword. Save up your smiles for later.|`|SvzKyWGXaa	Whatever you do, don't think of NOT smiling. That never works.|`|0hyytT8Eaa	I do it too, idk why but i just smile its weird. Anyway, i was in ROTC and i use to twist my tongue in my mouth to keep from laughing or smiling.|`|rMuWsjRWaa	Think of something sad.
H7ecdHDyaa	Well maybe just be more out going.<br>  But be yourself. Maybe dye your hair a different color or get high lights.<br>  <br>  (: YOu could get a snake bite and people would think you're cool, but thats kind of extreme.<br>  <br>  Just try to find a good edge but not too edgy|`|gndbaRgaaa	Before reading this ...

a9HSVexoaa	I think that replica watches from online sellers have a risk of fraud. <br>  But I bought replicas from this site and liked their payment process.
UnPjfLPNaa	They will, but you'll have to send it back through the mail, not take it to the store.|`|XkWTsyJdaa	no, if theres no reciept orrr tags, then u cant.|`|daW6oDReaa	the package should have come with an order form it has instruction on returns/ exchanges<br>  I dont know if they will let you do it in the store though, call and ask
sximwDT6aa	try embroidered tops<br>  corsets<br>  chokers<br>  thick eyeliner<br>  um well cotton on use to sell them a few months back<br>  so try the cotton on outlet|`|AA12381892	im not sure bout that whole leather jacket thing unless you ordered it online because i live in mississippi.aka the good ole u.s. of a.but i do know that goth and high fashion dont mix very well.the only thing i could think of is heavy on the eye makeup.like alotta eye liner and mascara.|`|X9PIqr05aa	high fashion and goth don't mix at all<br>  there opposites <br>  goth has nothing to do with fashion or being "fashionable"<br>  they don't care about that<br>  and just because you wear alot of black dosen`t mean your goth or can be goth<br>  thats not what its about<br>  & theres no way you can be goth at all<br>  your fashion obsessed which isnt what there like(at all)<br>  srry hun
HzjeKsDJaa	casual<br> <br> .|`|WItdtl0Vaa	Wear nice jeans and a cute sweater. Make sure you are comfortable and you feel pretty.|`|uySe1ePsaa	dark wash skinny jeans, a white tee (thats like scoop or v neck), a cute jacket, not like a hoodie, but you like a blazer or something, flats, and a nice tote bag or little hobo.|`|v0fooLeTaa	-skinny leg jeans with a cute top, ballet flats.<br>  - a casual skirt, basic tee with a cardigan, no high heels!<br>  - a shirt-dress with some pretty earrings<br>  - wear a cute scarf, a basic tee and a vest<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.supre.com.au/(hfmdx0roqgxoauutgponhf45)/ShopOnline/Product.aspx?pid=2&cid=142&sku=15161&ct=Cart" rel="nofollow">http://www.supre.com.au/(hfmdx0roqgxoauu...</a><br>  <br>  can be worn with a basic top or a top with a print on & jeans or a skirt. a really practical must have - i would buy it in black if you dont already have something similar
VgZ20wMlaa	i have the shampoo and doesnt make your hair grow faster.... BUT.....<br>  the stuff is great... use it and ull love your hair.... its a great product though =)|`|hh403SkVaa	well i use it on my horse :)<br>  <br>  I also used it on myself and it made my hear smell soooooo bad
oE0ApHqPaa	The stud seems to be in a good place.  There isn't really a "right" place, it just depends on your anatomy and the overall proportion.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	for a "lip" piercing yeah its too low, but it doesn't look bad so no worries|`|62vCoDPjaa	no your stud is in about the right place|`|GklW3C48aa	hmmm well mine is pierced a little higher but where yours is pierced makes it ideal for wearing a ring. If your unhappy then try a few different balls and rings.|`|ibY0ByIcaa	As long as it is comfy to you and it looks good, it does not make a difference. be confident in it and every1 will like it.|`|6UX9C1qoaa	thats not a lip ring u little tart|`|lhE1KkuLaa	I am not a fan of facial tattoos, but where you got yours seems to be the place others put them.
kltRWD81aa	They should be able to. Unless they have little knots in them then they can't repierce them. Because I had mine done when I was 7 or 8 and they got infected and took them out. And for my 13th birthday I went to get them done and they asked me if I had them done before and I said yes and the piercer told me they had to make sure there was no knots. My friend can't get them done again because she does have the knots. Just make sure they check before they pierce them.|`|78z7gk7naa	You can get them repierced, and I'm pretty should they could. I've gotten my ears repierced many times as a kid. Only because, I always hated taking earrings out [it hurt because I never twisted them!] so everytime I got them pierced I took them out and let them fill. xD|`|M6uIbKXRaa	yes u can i had scare tissue on my ear i went to walmart to get it repierced they asked how long it was closed for i told them 3 years they still were willing to and they do a great job at those cheap places
nZgZWrGWaa	both i thik...small are misterious, big are expressive...but not bulgy bug eyes...i hate those.|`|3btLY1QCaa	hmmm big:)|`|Sh5ZJ2EUaa	big|`|Pswqhimoaa	medium.<br>  and almond shaped.|`|RFcbLXh3aa	they both can be beautiful, I've seen both gorgeous small and big eyes. I've also seen small eyes and big eyes that are not so attractive.

WOW, send my a pic of the rest of ya, LOL....nice work.<br>  <br>  BYEEE.
g9iTh4SIaa	a sexy red color or dark blue. a light pink or shimmery purple also looks good.|`|nANyAvzgaa	Dusty Rose|`|OcHJtS2Naa	Bright colors are in right now.

Or maybe a light pink, i love both!
X9PIqr05aa	there is no "emo" culture genius<br>  "emo" is a music genre<br>  and if you weren't a poser then you wouldn't be asking how to dress "emo" or "punk"<br>  real punks dress in stuff that they that's weird and different so people don't copy them<br>  just be yourself and weat stuff that you like<br>  everyone hates posers|`|GykCnbR7aa	makeup is anytrhing really dark and diffierent and outgoing and the hair is like 3 or more inches  below the shoulder and each quarter inch is another layer and bangs are side bangs and about a inch above your ear and about every tenth of a inch is another layer and you could dye your hair dark blonde then under it light blond then your bangs dark brown and then diffierent colors in your hair blue,pink,orange,black,pink,purple,green... and wear heavy eye liner|`|Kpn4FnuSaa	by saying 'im not a poser" that makes you one. if you really were "emo" then youd just know how to dress that way...|`|nxIv4Lelaa	i love that look too, but i can't figure out how to do it either!
AFDTLXH4aa	i know this sounds stupid, but usually shirts with puffy sleeves help to deemphasize a big chest.|`|5d95ebb15bb0cd41de0cb8b36d7eb955aa	I am a 34E and minimizers work great for me.  Get a proper bra fitting at a fancy lingerie shop (not VS).  You might actually need a 34DD minimizer.  <br>  <br>  Remember, the band should always be tight at the loosest hook setting.|`|5UbC5hP9aa	Have you tried Sports Bras???|`|Jpgz4mSVaa	duct tape! if you can't duck it f*** it! :P|`|VJQAE4FRaa	ummmmmmm try a shirt htat is tight on your boobs but lose on your waste|`|NuvKPl3naa	have you tried a sports bra. minimizer bras should help some, ,maybe try another brand. where things that are not too tight. you can put a tank top on and cover that with another button down shirt. tops with buttons, ties etc help. i had large breasts myself i ended up having sx. i know how you feel.|`|7sqpiGgoaa	we'll need photo's to help you with that
jGqZdS2xaa	Put your own little twist on things! Paint your nails black. Wear little bow barrets. I know this doesnt sound emo but trust me it is. Next time you go shopping buy colored skinny jeans, just not super tight ones. Be creative and be yourself. No matter what! Wow, 2 or 3 hours a day! I think if you practice that much then you should be really good someday because thats a lot of practicing.<br>  <br>  Hope this Helps! <3|`|H7ecdHDyaa	ok well you might wanna shop online like @ debb or hottopic. but hottopic is pricey unless you get clearance or good discounts.<br>  <br>  (: hoped i helped.

There is nothing wrong with wanting to treat yourself to something you love whether it is a handbag or even going on vacation.  If you have your money saved and this is something that you have wanted for such a long time, just do it.  I think you will appreciate this handbag more than if someone just "gave" it to you as a gift.  <br>  <br>  I would not really worry about other people's opinion.  What matters is what you like.|`|vFCxdraNaa	Personally I think you should buy the handbag regardless of what other people say. You deserve to treat your self to something nice every so often. You can tell your mother she should be proud you that you are supporting the American economy and purchasing an American designed bag. Also the more you spend the more you help the economy!<br>  I say go for it!|`|JOmImho0aa	of course its ok to spoil urself once in a while<br>  everyone deserves it!<br>  <br>  but if ur mom doesn't believe u, then make a deal with her, telling her if u get an A on a test, or keep ur room clean, then she will buy u the purse<br>  <br>  and by the way, that purse is hott<br>  =)<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|d8EYaNw2aa	I love juicy couture purses they las a long time and they resell really well don't worry about what your mom says it is your money and you should spend it how you want!|`|9556ce3b5bbc6563054ca4da2c6f3a96aa	yes it is perfectly alright to spoil yourself every so often. I do all the time.|`|kLpMhl9laa	I have been in your situation before. If you really love the bag and you can't go a week without thinking about it, then you should get it. Also, think about it...are you going to use it a lot? Will it match a lot of your outfits? If so, then you definitely should get it. Also, it's good to get a friend's point of view, so take your best friend shopping with you and show her. Ask her if she sees you using it, and if she loves it and sees you with the bag, then get it. If anything, you can wait to see if it will go on sale, but I doubt that it will go down that much. Anyway, Good Luck!

LKlQkElAaa	OMG, that dress is so adorable!<br>  About the size, my sister is 5'1 and 100 lb. SHe normaly uses sizes 1-3. It all depend on the style of the clothing. But this dress looks like a good fit. I would say it would fit you. It is a really cute dress.|`|RFCcWPliaa	You would probably fit a three. I am normally a 2/3/4, but in dresses I can take up to a 10 because I have big boobs. The dress will fit me perfectly but then stop zipping when it gets to my chest, which can be really frustrating. Dresses generally run smaller, though, so a three would probably fit. I'm guessing you normally take about a 1/2/3?<br>  Hope I helped!|`|9WKVmOs1aa	shut up<br>  i hate skinny bitches.|`|q7SQ6Tgfaa	it would be a little big try 2|`|a2PEM6nLaa	Yeah it would fit|`|4ZjWUjv6aa	i think it would be okay for you|`|4n6yhUbyaa	size three will be fine

I3RngZ76aa	It will not effect your brain for sure, but it may feel a little uncomfortable.These things happen to me a lot sometimes but the best thing to do is blink a couple of times, wash your out with some water or clean your hand and get it out if it is easy. Most likely it will roll back to the front of your eye and will come out. Soon enough you will be back to normal.|`|s4psKJrPaa	calm down calm down it didnt go to your brain! eyelashes get in everyones eyes ALL the time! just put some eyedrops in if you wanna, you dont have to, your fine.<br>  <br>  mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090306183423AAvaLHR">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|bYaxOfWOaa	Don't stress! I had a chalazion cyst (a stye on the inside of my eyelid) drained and a few days later my eye was stinging a little, so I went to the doctor and she flipped my eyelid inside out (not as bad as it sounds!) and flushed it out with saline (again, not as bad as it sounds). Got rid of the eyelash and the pain. <br>  You won't get brain damage, but if it still irritates you and you don't have it checked out, you may be doing damage to your eye.<br>  <br>  Please don't worry, just a simple 5 minute doctor's visit will fix this!|`|Nq2HzAHgaa	just look up and as far as you can and then rub your eye til it comes out. haha dont panick hun i dont think youll get brain damage.|`|y6qL8rc1aa	Don't flip out haha.

zmjAccMFaa	1) it really is not all that bad.  It is not the most painful piercing I have ever had.  Just take someones hand to hold if you get scared.<br>  2) It can depend on the shop.  I am going guess around 35-40 dollars.  This usually includes the jewelry.  Some places even the h2ocean.<br>  3) No it shouldn't have any negative effect.<br>  <br>  :]<br>  enjoy your new piercing.<br>  If you have any other questions feel free to ask.|`|928YGlFgaa	i got my belly button pierced a little over two months ago, and it doesnt really hurt, but it hurts more than people said it did. people told me it didnt hurt at all, that the clamp they use to pinch your stomach so they can pierce it hurts more than the actual needle. in my opinion,  the clamp did not hurt at all, and the needle hurt. Honestly, it is not really that bad. it is deffinately worth it, and the pain really only lasts for like 3 seconds max. i went to Visions in medfield, (VERY nice place to go), and for the piercing and ring it cost me 65 dollars, but therre also cheaper rings you can get and more expensive ones. the actual piercing part costs around 30 dollars, then its just the price of the ring you choose added to it. i didnt have any cramps, and i didnt need to take tylenol or any pain relievers. one thing though is to be EXTREMELY careful with it after you get it pierced, it is going to be very sore, you will not be able to sleep on your stomach , go swimming for a least a month, and if anyone or anything hits you in the stomach , it is going to hurt A LOT. but deffinately do it, it is SO worth it, it is my favorite piercingg:) good luck!|`|u1FlCXL0aa	no its not got mine <br>  30 bucks- 40<br>  you dont get craps<br>  well i didnt|`|N0cmhQYJaa	hahaha weenie. ok mine was 70 dollars @ a tattoo parlor. you go in lay down on a bed thing they clean your stomach make a dot and then it was more painful than everyone says. like it felt like exactly what it is. like someone was stabbing me with a needle in my belly lol. but the pain only lasts like 5 seconds so you can do it. but yeah it hurt so bad lol. its so worth it dont back out because when its over you wont be in pain it just feels kinda weird. and dont touch it !!!! it can get infected that way. good luck itll be soo cute

It's the same as buying regular contact lenses except a little more costly.|`|jdNisPl2aa	So talk to your eye doctor- they will give you all the info you need. Also, when you are getting your contacts, ask for colored ones.|`|jZOMSP4Saa	www.color-my-eyes.com and you can google others, they are called plano lenses and a lot of web sites sell them with out a RX ,Its like looking through glass, cant tell the difference.

I ordered some for halloween, Cat eyes! Hope this helps.

Just say you didn't wear those goggles they give you when you tan -- you could permanently burn the retinas of your eyes and be blind for the rest of your life. I have worked in salons that offered tanning, and the reason there are laws about underage tanning is because you could really hurt yourself, and they figure it should be a parent's responsibility to care for their own child. If a salon lets you tan without your parent's written permission, they probably are not a good salon to go to anyway, because there are probably other things wrong that you can't see.  Like dirty, unsanitary tanning beds and filthy towels!|`|04a3fd03d580fe26c3dfba6da04fd881aa	The beach, outside, sky roof, green house, ect. lol I live in Indiana my friends and I usually just lay outside and we get pretty tanned, try seeing if anybody owns a tanning bed that you can hang with them and use.|`|joyXUpkMaa	How about a tanning salon or just rest in the sun for an hour or so.<br>  But need sunscreen!|`|EZ2tpETIaa	The beach?? :P
Pp9jk2XYaa	There are a bunch of ways to make hair shiny.<br>  <br>  First, you need to stop using blow-dryers, straighteners, curlers, etc, pretty much anything that brings heat to your hair. This damges your hair and with time you can go bald. <br>  <br>  Then, CONDITION CONDITION CONDITION! conditioner was made to make hair shiny and pretty! <br>  <br>  Third, ice! it sounds weird but I heard (and have done) that if you rub an ice cube in your hair it makes it shinier. Idk why but I know it works without making your hair wet.<br>  <br>  If you dye your hair, stop. Again this damages your hair.<br>  <br>  Damaged hair = not shiny hair = frizzy hair<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|3PO45ncPaa	umm what i usually do is take a jar of peanut butter and rub it through my hair, and i rinse it out in the shower with COLD water, hot water will dry it out (no shampoo or conditioner) and then dont dry it (let it air dry over night) the next day use shampoo and conditioner and it will be really shiny after you dry and straighten or w/e! <br>  <br>  I usually do this like every two weeks, thats abiout how long the shine lasts.|`|6CjUvgHPaa	after you wash your hair and towel-dry so its slightly damp, use BioSilk Silk Therapy. <br>  it's a tiny bottle of hair serum. you can find it anywhere like local drugstores, walmart... etc.  it's around $20, yes it's expensive but it works like magic. If you're lucky you could find it for for only $7 at beauty supply stores.|`|Z4HD1hgFaa	shampoo every other day but condition every single day. also, deep conditioner works well.

LuTjBw4Laa	you soak your hair in lemon juice and sit out in the sun. or you can use blond shampoo or leave in conditioner and sit out in the sun. it will make your hair become lighter without using dyes. (:|`|3PO45ncPaa	what you do ( this really works. its an old trick my grandma used to lighten her hair when she was a teen) is you soak your hair in milk and then spray it with hair spray and then a few squeezes of lemon juice here and there then sit out in the sun for a few hours (remember sun screen!!)<br>  <br>  worked for me!|`|VCRAsRQPaa	Lemon juice and laying in the sun.<br>  Also I don't know if they still make it but when I was in high school we used to use Sun In and blow dry our hair.  It makes your hair really fried though.

NsePqNIEaa	I wish I really knew pant sizes well, but all I know are sizes 0-2.<br>  But dude, you're 5' 7"! Size 6 is probably pretty decent.<br>  I can't blame you for having body image problems.<br>  I mean I'm size 0 but I honestly think I have huge thighs and a flabby stomach. :S<br>  <br>  But if everyone tells you they're not fat, you're not.<br>  People often exaggerate and call average people fat (I'm guilty of this), so if people say you're NOT fat, that's probably true.<br>  <br>  Are you eating healthy, though? D:<br>  I hope you are.<br>  Size 6 and 5' 7" doesn't sound bad at all.|`|jtYL9Qqnaa	youre fine, its a really good weight.<br>  and if people are saying you're thin, you ARE.|`|85gJHDbNaa	I understand exactly what you mean. Whenever I look in the mirror, I never see the actual shape of my body, or how thin it probably is (I just lost almost 15-20 lbs), and all I see is how flabby it is even for it's small size (I'm 5'4" 113 lbs). What makes me feel better is working out. Working out by dancing, doing push ups, and sit ups helps me feel better about myself because though I'm not trying to lose much more weight, I look in the mirror when I'm done and in my head I see myself looking better, even if I really don't look any different. My best advice is to do things that put you in a good state of mind, unless it's overeating. I work at an ice cream store, so sometimes I get really bad cravings and eat a bunch of our products and look in the mirror and feel horrible. Everyone deals with some sort of body image problem, the best thing to do about it is to make healthy choices that will make you feel leaner and fit.|`|I3RngZ76aa	Wow, great job loosing the weight. Dont feel fat, if your friends say that you look skinny then they are probably telling the truth. Loving the way you look is such a huge problem today for woman and the people that can over come that are such an inspiration. Greatness comes in many different shapes and sizes and so does beauty, both inside and out. So instead of thinking that you are fat, maybe you should think about the 100 or so pounds that you lost and what an inspiration that may be for someone who started out just like you.
XbXGEUGlaa	I don't suggest it.<br>  I went tanning for a dance and honestly, it's so overrated! I hated it.<br>  I could feel my skin baking, and I smelled terrible afterwards and in general, my tan wasn't that impressive.<br>  Tanning beds make you look red more than tan.|`|YPV02h36aa	Uhm, do you want skin cancer?|`|AA11991313	i would advise u to use self tanner|`|ojkEd5Fcaa	DONT DO IT!!! It is so bad for you. I used to go tanning and then all of a sudden last summer I was at the beach when my boyfriend & father noticed a a freckle on my leg that was really dark. I went to my regular doctor and he had advised me to see a dermatologist.. I went to the dermatologist & I had to get a biopsy to see if it was skin cancer!! He said that it definitely from tanning. He ran a biopsy and it came back negative for skin cancer but they had to make sure it was removed 100% because it contained abnormal cells. I had to go to a plastic surgeon & I had 15 stitches internal & external & now I have a HUGE scar.. THANKS TO TANNING BEDS! I have not stepped foot in a tanning bed since.. & I will ALWAYS wear sunscreen. Hope you realize it is not a smart decsion. Just becaue your mom can use a tanning bed & hasn't had any problems, doesn't mean you won't. My mom would go tanning all the time & she was fine. Now, she also refuses to go because of my horrible experience.|`|lsiyoSRaaa	Sure if you want your skin to look like old leather when you are older.

XeklcIPBaa	Well if you want to do it without notice, I suggest shopping at a store like forever 21.  It is relatively inexpensive- especially compared to stores like Hollister and Abercrombie.  And it also has several different kinds of styles and there's no big brand name logo on the front of everything.  Just look for things that are different than what you normally wear but at the same time, things you like.  What exactly are you trying to change your style to?|`|S2xQlfEUaa	try wearing band t's and more interesting jeans, like different shades and skinny ones, and brighter colors for shirts. the skinny jeans will make you look more feminine and the colors will add interest to your look without you having to change too much.a good pair of black flats or keds skimmers can last you forever, and you can wear them with everything<br>  <br>  try american apparel, they have basic stuff in loads of colors and cool tshirts with spin-art designs.|`|9pinCoi2aa	try layering things.  <br>  buy lots of plain tank tops, tshirt (v-neck and crew neck)<br>  and a couple different cardigans. <br>  <br>  these are pieces you can all mix and match, that will look great with the jeans you have already!<br>  <br>  the Gap has a lot of great bright coloured pieces for layering this spring! you should definitely try there|`|AA12393369	try wearing a skirt, then a dress, then go on from there. <br>  go step by step.|`|GykCnbR7aa	maybe buy bermudas and some shorty shorts and a couple dresses and several sun dresses and dressier tops|`|cxhsI7tbaa	try looking for simple knits and sweaters...it wont look like too girly-girl but it will make you look less tom-boy. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ae.com/web/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.ae.com/web/index.jsp</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hollisterco.com/hol/homepage.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hollisterco.com/hol/homepage....</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.abercrombie.com/anf/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.abercrombie.com/anf/index.htm...</a>

Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products.

Well I pierced one myself... All I did was took a needle, cleaned it, pushed it through, took it out, took an earring with a sharp back, pushed it through the hole, and took care of it.

Its really not too expensive or anything...|`|sPDQIxJTaa	stick something sharp through them.<br>  should do the trick.|`|qjCY4Y7zaa	You can buy needles online or at some Karma stores.

I held ice on both sides of my earlobe (in a rag so my fingers wouldn't freeze), then when they went numb, i took a lighter and burnt the end of the needle to sterilize it, then picked a spot and pushed it through.  You don't have to do it really fast, but if you haven't gotten through by the time the numbness goes away, you can always pull the needle out, refreeze, and repeat until your through.  All in all though, Id suggest you get it done professionally, as professional work is a little more sterile, and it's fast so the pain is over and done with.  I think you have to be 16?  I could be wrong, if nothing else, ask at the store ^^|`|yVdW756Gaa	1. Be careful and clean to avoid any infection if you do decide to do this.

They had peircing kits for about 5 bucks. I'm sure if you check they have them somewhere. Call drug stores and department stores local to you and ask if they do have it.

I dont think any legit piercer would do it until youre better|`|uSqc6bUuaa	yea|`|sWXrnErnaa	Generally not for a couple of reasons, firstly you immune system is down fighting your cold which increases the rate of infection - not a good thing if your intending in pocking holes in yourself, secondly have some respect for the piercer they dont want your cold, thirdly if you have a cold it is going to be very difficult to keep the area germn free again increasing the risk of infection.<br>  <br>  If you already have a booking I suggest you contact the piercer and explain the situation and ask to rebook your appointment.|`|WQb5154Qaa	I wouldn't recommend it. A cold is an infection so it may spread into your piercing.

WQb5154Qaa	Try this. Every day look in the mirror tell yourself you are beautiful. Repeat it 10 times. Then two more times during the day do the same thing. Then do it right before you go to bed. YOU HAVE TO SAY IT OUT LOUD! <br>  <br>  Just look yourself in the eyes and say I am beautiful. It is subliminal and your sub-conscience will eventually start to change the way you feel about yourself. Also you have to do this every single day for six months.

Also wear some converse and go to hot topic and pick out a tee they have really punk stuff but make sure you dress punk and not goth don't dress in all black. Dye your hair with neon green of red . Hot topic sells dye you can get everything you need from hot topic except the converse for converse go to foot locker or finish line also you can get dcs they are skater shoes that works. If you don't won't to buy shoes just wear black flip flops also studded bracelets are punk and checkered scraves are cool too.|`|g5pZhzeoaa	Punk is more of an attitude and a way of life.  It is about being yourself and being proud of the fact that you are being true to yourself.  It is about voicing your opinion.  Where this whole bad*** thing came into punk as a necessity, I don't know.<br>  The most punk you can get in a style is by wearing whatever you like.  It could be something you love that you already have or it could be the thing you like the most in the whole mall.  It is more in the way you carry yourself than anything else.  By you and your friend going into school and wearing whatever you wanted would be punk.  When someone asks you what you are I guess you could say punk, though that is not exactly what it is.  But, I think it would make more of a statement and going to Hot Topic.  By the way, I would not define that as punk because of the fact that is such a mainstream store, and the fact that the clothing is accessible by everyone and anyone. I think the originality and individuality was lost.|`|f95d8d23d21b4573c32c7f22e917ba8eaa	You should like wear reallly bright colored skinny jeans and wear graphic tees or band tees.

Or even just catch the train down to Bondi Junction, they have everything there.<br>  For cheep, chic shopping, try Crown street in Surry Hills. They get pretty cheep there.<br>  Try and look for this shop called Funky Femme or something like that. There is one in Coogee, Bondi beach, theres a few everywhere, They have cute stuff ranging from $15 o $40. <br>  Good luck!

l74RoxUDaa	Of course you can - in fact many actors are shy and self conscious about themselves, but can open up through the characters they are portraying.  It gives them licence, since other people are judging the character, not the real person.<br>  <br>  Look at the Carry On comic actor Kenneth Williams, who in real life was an incredibly shy, extremely knowledgable intellectual, and yet had this outrageous outgoing persona on screen.<br>  <br>  What is important is that you must always separate the character from yourself, and keep the real you well protected and safe for those you truly love.  Always remember who you really are, and that your character is just a mask you can take off when the performance is over.<br>  <br>  If you know yourself, then you have the skills needed to know a character.|`|bXmRWbEdaa	Well, force yourself.

Get past your inhibitions and go for it.|`|vFZCjBVQaa	I think that many actors are shy, and keep to themselves.  HOWEVER, when you say "self-confident", this has to be 100 percent true because you have to get up in front of whoever asks you and be able to perform, no matter the conditions.  If you aren't to that point, I would suggest memorizing manuscripts and performing them in front of whoever you can find - start with your family members, and then maybe join an improv or theater group at a community center.  Even if you think you are good when you are reading off of a paper alone in your room, this means nothing unless you can get yourself to be awesome when others are looking.  Acting is a performance, after all.  It's not just a test at how well you can read.|`|OsG3AEwjaa	Of course, it's all about building your confidence up and acting is a great way to do that, i want to act as well but im really shy and self consious but i know it's possible to be a good actor (:<br>  <br>  x|`|vWOuX1d5aa	You gotta be able to be in front of crowds, and be loud and outgoing.

Gw5MF2Ebaa	Sportin waves is way too heavy especially if you're athletic and sweat a lot.  It's a heavy pomade and probably won't do much more than cause you to shampoo much more often than necessary. Lot's of build up too.  If you have African American hair, the trick is the opposite of European, which is old fashioned dampness and a light oil applied after your favorite conditioning shampoo.  Wonder 8 Oil is my favorite and you can use it for hair, scalp and body.  I use it for all three of my boys and, believe me, it takes them from tough and tight to soft and smooth if that's the look of the day for them.<br>  <br>  After you've moisturized (with both water and a light oil mist) simply put on a stocking cap (no....not the doo rag from the beauty suupply store) because you'll need that weight to hold down those handsome waves in the making.  Trust me...old fashioned and free is always better than new and marketed with us in mind.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, DO NOT TAKE OFF YOUR CAP during sports and always sleep in it.

My face would never take a tan like the rest of my body, and would just burn and then turn back to white. The reason, I found out later in life, was that there is less pigment (called melanin) in the face than in the rest of the body on some fortunate people like you and myself. There is no way you can get your face to match except to use blush, self-tanners or darker makeup. GOOD LUCK!

that. i suggest shop.pacsun.com and go to girls, new arrivals, and find your style. it will definitely help you get started. remember, style isnt stylish unless its you, so make it all you and let it reflect your inner self. if you are athletic do shorts and tees. if your girls, flirty dresses and stuff. if your punk rock. skinny jeans and tees. whatever you want. just make it you. again i recommend shop.pacsun.com to help find your inner style and turn it in 2 outfits.|`|a8qx0SD9aa	<a href="http://www.polyvore.com/for_lilkristin13/set?id=7031387"

C1twceXQaa	I have seen those glasses in Urban Outfitters, and also Ray-Ban.<br>  <br>  Those styles are definitely the new trend this year.
cgcT9kPQaa	I would say a 2/3. Try on different sizes until you find the right fit! :D|`|ae4b34f826d7e29652134e6a16fd955aaa	If you are wanting to buy something online, the website often posts measurement tables asking for your bust, waist, and hips measurements. If you are buying in a store, you just need to try the item on as women's clothing changes size with the brand. <br>  <br>  **FUN FACT** The more expensive the line, the larger the sizes will run-- for instance, if you go to buy something from Saks, and you would wear a 7/8 normally, then you'll be able to buy a 4/6 at Saks or Nordstroms, etc... this is a way that manufacturers and designers flatter the women willing to shell out a little more green.<br>  <br>  Alright, that said, see how women's sizes can fluctuate. So, to get your measurements if you can't physically be present with the item before buying it, just use a tape measure to measure your body. It helps if there is someone to help to make sure the tape is straight. If you don't have a measuring tape, use a piece of string or something, mark off the point the string crosses, then hold it up to a yard stick or ruler to get your inches. If you don't have those, I have in the past just cut the string where ever it crosses, labeled it with tape what body part it accompanies, and taken the string to a fabric store down the street to have them measure the pieces ;)<br>  <br>  So, how to measure? Most sites will have a how-to guide. I'll post below one I found that is very good at showing you how. Once you have your measurements, just check the dress manufacturer's web site to see what measurements fit their dress sizes. <br>  <br>  Happy shopping! :)

mQprRQHgaa	I don't know, but if you want the exact ones, be willing to pay 500, maybe all the way to 3000. They're most likely designer.
AA12367392	Mine was past my knees till just recently, I have always just put it in a loose bun on top or at the back of your head, I know what you mean about washing your hair that used to drive me mad too, and those who are pulling your hair are just plain out mean, so either braid it or put it in a bun, I use to bend over and brush it from the base of you skull and brush it down then grab it in a pony tail then twist it around and then you will have a bun, I use a large hair comb to keep it in place, hope this helps, goodluck! :)
GMsiKRQVaa	They're all old stuff.  Unless you're looking for something from two seasons ago, don't bother.<br>  <br>  I'm sure they have leather wallets, but at this time, I think it's better to go to your local mall, and find a merchant who's discounting quite a bit off MSRP.

KVzBqWhvaa	By 6months/2yrs it'll probably be healed and the hole will be there permanently. The hole is pretty visible. It's not really a huge hole or anything, but you can really see it. Some of my friends hate taking their ring out because of that reason.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	i took mine out after a year and it closed up probably in a couple days max,  i dont really remember that well, (it was like 5 years ago) but i know it didnt take long at all. i dont have a pic of my scar, its not bad at all looks like one of the ones below..but these are some i found of healed bellybutton piercings.<br>  <a href="http://www.bodymattersgold.com/a_images/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bodymattersgold.com/a_images/...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bodymattersgold.com/a_images/..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bodymattersgold.com/a_images/...</a><br>  <a href="http://images2.cafemom.com/images/user/g..." rel="nofollow">http://images2.cafemom.com/images/user/g...</a>|`|gh2gVcESaa	How long it takes to close, this varies from perosn to person and also how long you have had the piercing. Never remove a piercing for more than a few minutes if it is less than a year and a half to two years old, simply as a precaution. If it is old enough the best way to check is to remove your piercing in the morning when you get up and periodically (every four hours) slip the jewelry back in and see if it's stiff or still loose. If it stays loose throughout the entire day add an hour or two to how long the jewelry is out. If you can go 16 or more hours without it getting stiff I would then leave it out over night (your body heals better at night when you are resting) and try to put it in first thing in the morning. If it's stiff then you know what you should not leave it out overnight, but during the day. This is the best way I can think to do this as it works VERY well for new (but old enough) piercings and stretched piercings. <br>  <br>  And itll look like a red-ish spot. scar thingy xD|`|p1GmSlHKaa	you will have a hole most likely it will close up if you take it out 6 months from the day you get it. I have my pierced and is something you know you want to get and you will keep. If your not sure your going to like it dont get it.|`|cSrxQHIhaa	i think it would either leave a hole in your belly button or it would have a hole at first then eventually close over and leave you with a scare. of course there are no guarantees of it actually closing over. your belly button will sag over and the top will be like a flap. not attractive.
QKhq9MTeaa	ummm...... i went 2 the website and the dresses looked all right but it looks like a scam i wouldn't order a dress from them.instead try this website:davids bridal (type that in google)

kLpMhl9laa	Wow. You sound just like me. I'm in that same size range and hated my thighs. I was totally skeptical about trying on skinny jeans. But then I finally gave in and tried them on one day and I LOVED THEM! I recommend the skinny jeans from PacSun in either the Hermosa super skinny or the Venice skinny. The Venice skinny isn't as tight, so you might want to try those first. And if you really feel scared about skinny jeans and your thighs, go for a darker wash because lighter washes make your thighs look huge! As for the size, start with the 3 first, and if your pants are a little big, go a size down. Good Luck finding the perfect pair of skinny jeans! :]|`|FF2ausPjaa	I have fat theighs to but i still wear skinny jeans.|`|gU3yIZwMaa	flares can make your legs thicker then they are.<br>  <br>  they`re loose at the bottom, and tight through the thigh -- guess where your attention will be. i wear slim boot (especially when they flare out from the knees like 70s jeans) to make my legs look fuller than they are. <br>  <br>  if skinnies don`t work, try a slim straight -- which are really like skinnies for people with larger calves.

If you can't find that, find a different dress.|`|RFCcWPliaa	It's considered disrespectful to show your shoulders. If you have a sleeveless dress, my advice would be to get a cute shawl and just wear it while you are inside the temple.|`|TfmvWPLLaa	NOT supposed to show shoulders!! so yeah if there is a dress u really like that shows shoulders just get a shrug, sweater or shawl...anything that covers the shoulders.

CLFFddsKaa	I did this myself for the simple reason that I love the water. During the summer months, I am a mermaid. I have my relaxed hair braided with extensions with the ends left loose so that I can wear it in different styles. I condition my scalp and the natural part of my hair before getting into the water. Then I rinse out any salt (ocean) or chlorine (pool) afterward. Sometimes I let it dry naturally, sometimes I blow it somewhat dry. One thing to remember is that your hair is permed and you should not get it braided too tight. It is important to remember to condition, condition, condition. Go to your hairdresser for a good condition, he/she can tell you if your hair is strong enough to withstand braids for 3 or 4 months. I did it successfully, my hair grew a lot and when I went back to my hairdresser to have them taken out. I had a lot of new growth and I was able to resume my relaxer problem free. If you relax your hair with the home kits. I suggest you have your hair "serviced" professionally before making this transition and afterwards. It's a very delicate process touching up new growth without overlapping.|`|lAQRpH2Iaa	First of all a shampoo and conditioner can't make your hair grow faster. Second the relaxer will strip your color and why not try curly most people who don't have curly hair envy people like you. It's probably beautiful.|`|Gw5MF2Ebaa	Either way, our hair needs load of tlc and has to be well maintained to remain healthy.  The stage between perm and natural is one that really calls for a lot of care.  It's going to be tempting to go with the heat to bake in those crimps and curls but you can still have fun without using it.  Even with a lot of perm left, you can do twist outs (twisting your freshly shampooed and conditioned hair section by section) and then allowing it to air dry will give you a cute summery style once it drys and you untwist.  Invest in lots of head band and clip and have a ball.  If you want to braid, be careful of the tension.  Your hair still has perm and will break easily so not so tight.  Speaking of, box braids are cute if your lifestyle will let you have a fun and free look.  Just put coated rubber bands at the end to keep them from unraveling.  Regular bands are going to damage.

BGXXryihaa	Well Proactive didn't do anything good for my skin, except make it break out way worse. And i used it for almost 4 months and never once saw improvement. But that's just my skin, it may work for you, every ones skin is different.<br>  <br>  And ive had no experience with Neutrogena Skin ID, so i cant help you there :P<br>  <br>  But the best thing i did for my skin was went to a dermatologist, and got prescribed a face wash and spot treatment. So if that is available to you, i definitely recommend seeing a dermatologist :)|`|RjJMV20taa	Those are the expensive ones but there are cheaper ones out there that work just as good.|`|jt55tkDnaa	Proactive didn't work for me at all. As far neutrogena the foaming face wash worked the best for me because I am sensitive to so many acne cleanser ingredients. So I would try the Neutragena first because that wont drain your wallet.|`|swNzTwUfaa	I tried the Proactive and all it did was create a hole in my wallet and gave me more acne.
Gw5MF2Ebaa	There's a great new product called "Color Oops" sold at Walgreen's.  They have lots of corrective products in this line.  If you don't live anywhere near Walgreen's, Google "Color Oops" to see if it's sold anywhere in your area.  If all else fails, most stores specializing in hair and beauty will carry products that strip the deposits from hair dyes and return your hair to its natural color so you can try again.  Just don't add anymore color before using a corrective solution or your problem will continue to get worse. Good luck!l<br>  <br>  P.S.  Adding any more color is definitely going to give you either another shade of green or even worse on the color chart.|`|6Low6Ok6aa	that totally sucks! :[ dye your whole head one color i think thats the best thing.

WiIUEObTaa	after two years of thought. posting this question, knowing artwork and location. your mind is made up. defiantly have it done a s a p . the indecision will drive you nuts. there is no pain , easier than you can imagine. please for your sake and your parents sake. have it done. you will never regret your decision.|`|kCdISEGqaa	My question would be what state do you live in?  Only a few states allow tattooing of minors.  It is illegal and the artist could lose their license and your father could be turned in for child endangerment.  Best to make sure your state allows it.  Even if they do, no reputable artist will tattoo a minor, it's just bad practice.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  OK, here's the deal, if you go out of state, and try to get it done, you will be turned away.  In order for you to get tattooed as a minor, you must be a resident of the state you are being tattooed in.  It doesn't work as easily as you think.  Your father could get tattooed out of state, but not a minor.  Just wait, you have the rest of your life to get tattooed.  You are still growing and developing, your body will thank you for waiting.|`|Vnj95hFTaa	I got my first tattoo when I was fifteen so I don't think it's a bad idea.

That's awesome that your dad will take you (:|`|PPdsvTO8aa	i think it's fine. tattoo's are meant to be very special to you and should have meaning. just make sure you wouldn't mine looking at it for the rest of your life.|`|82V8XxbRaa	I recommend you read the following article:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shegsy.com/want_a_tattoo.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shegsy.com/want_a_tattoo.html</a>|`|pb7qPJcxaa	I think your dad has poor judgment.

It's wrong.|`|2SScKK2Gaa	I like that tatto, and i think you should get it on your ankle bone :) <br>  I dont think it is wrong to get a tattoo at age 16. <br>  If your dad has second thoughts about it then i think you should just tell him that you will get it in a place that its not very visable in, like your ankle :)...i think it would look the best there anyway :)|`|6Low6Ok6aa	i dont think it is. <br>  i want a tattoo also but my parents wont let me get one cuz they think im to young. ill be turning 16 in july as well.<br>  if your dads okay with it i think you should go for it.<br>  i think getting a tattoo in your teen years is something you should do. seems right for some reason. you can always look back at it when your older. it would be a great memory.<br>  :]|`|Apqri7Tfaa	When you get a tattoo, you get it with the idea that you are going to have it for the rest of your life. I think the reason people think 16 is too young is because its easy to be impulsive and get something stupid. I do like the design, but I feel like a tattoo should mean something to you, not just some tattoo you get because you want a tattoo. <br>  Also, getting it on your foot or ankle will really hurt. I would suggest that you get it on the back of your shoulder, and get it that size or smaller. Also most jobs won't let you have visible tattoos. Keep that in mind.
C0HZ8ZB4aa	Yes, your artist will be able to design this concept for you. My advice would be to find as many inspirational images as you can - styles you like, patterns, photos, drawings, anything (deviantart.com is really good) - even if they don't resemble anything like the kind of tattoo you want, just anything that shows what sort of style you like or a little part that you want from an image. For example I've given my artist some photos of curtain covers, photoframes and patterns on vintage objects to help him along with the style of a piece he's going to design for me. Then say or write down in as much detail as you possibly can what it is exactly you want and hopefully your artist will come up with something perfect! And I personally prefer love frees us all - I think it flows better for a tattoo! Good luck!|`|CIlwfiU3aa	you can definitely get a tattoo artist to design it for you.. <br>  <br>  I went in to my artist gave her a good idea of what I wanted and this is what she drew..<br>  <br>  I love it and im getting the outline at the end of this month!<a href="http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=viewImage&friendID=9853622&albumID=2570801&imageID=57843431" rel="nofollow">http://viewmorepics.myspace.com/index.cf...</a><br>  <br>  oh and its also on my chest.. any artist who wont custom design your tattoo shouldn't be a tattoo artist|`|63WldH6kaa	for acne,fair complexion,tanning,sunburn,marks,<br>  spots,make up tips,hair issues n other skin n hair problems<br>  u can refer to dis website<br>  <a href="http://skincaretipps1053.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://skincaretipps1053.notlong.com</a><br>  it has got so many tips n free beauty samples<br>  for curing acne and all your skin problems|`|wwSz1ht5aa	thats the cutest idea !

It was throbbing at one point and felt really hot, but it really didn't hurt. It was just uncomfortable. I got it years ago and for a while it kept getting infected...sooner than later it completely healed and it hasn't hurt at all since. I would go through that again. It wasn't that bad at all. My friend and I actually joked about the little pain that was there. It was freezing cold outside so our ears basically went numb. The cold felt good though lol<br>  <br>  Edit: I just read some answers...I do agree...it did take a while to heal. Just make sure you take good care of it and follow any instructions given.

JDQP0Phraa	Of course I shop at thrift stores! Sometimes I find really great stuff. No, I don't buy all of my clothes second hand, and hell no, I don't buy bathing suits, bras, or panties there. But some of my best jackets and shoes have been bought from thrift shops.|`|nOAlXAJ5aa	it depends on how pre-worn it is, or how old it is. I go to yard sales sometimes and if I see something that I would wear I will buy it, and usually for like 85% cheaper than at a thrift store|`|uCsu1VYgaa	I do!<br>  for the following reasons<br>  1) cheap, I can save money.

All the things are clean and I really don't see a problem with it.

Perhaps I would not buy undergarments there; that would be logical; but I see no reason to not shop there. Those who seem to have a problem, in my opinion only, though I'm sure shared by many are those that I would not have as friends anyway. Society is not a perfect world. And the economics of it even more disparaging. Not only do the thrifts many times offer new things for sale but they are certainly far cheaper than the outlet malls and the local one of course. I have bought a lot of clothes at the thrift store and people want to act snooty then I say I'll remember than when I sell my Jewelry to you or do your taxes.   As they say, Paybacks - In my opinion they help a lot of people. They provide work experience to many and some who can't get a job for societies way of alienating the less fortunate they provide them with a better life than most would have lived anyway. They may not be cheap at times but in the end, the real reasons to shop there is not for the products but the people you meet are always quality people. That is why I shop there. And I don't mind at least I know they will be there next time and still have a job.  That is the best part. Friends. Those who will not shop there; The Late "great" Leona Hemsley might agree with them.  I have in all honesty found nothing different about the docker pants I might have bought at a thrift and those that JC Penney might have sold.  - I suppose one other mention; those who don't shop there, send them my way; they want to spend their money I can help them. They'll like me at least I won't give it away like the thrifts do - Perhaps that is why they won't shop there?  (smiles)... They want to pay high prices.|`|x3NHiS9faa	no its just not my thing. i mean, i really like name brand stuff and i am not trying to brag but i have the money to buy stuff from chanel and gucci and stuff. i am not the kind of person though that thinks your uncool or whatever if you dont wear name brands. i am perfectly fine with wearing stuff from target or charlotte russe or where ever as long as its cute. i dont know i just am not the kind of person that likes to shop at thrift stores. though, if you dont have alot of money, go to stores and look for cute things. put together outfits and i am sure that you will look good.|`|gU3yIZwMaa	very limited.<br>  <br>  only for fashion curiosities, even when i find something it better be in immaculate condition. when it is, i don`t wear until i soak in salt, vinegar and water overnight (salt and vinegar helps set the dye, and also acts as an antiseptic). then i wash it normal.|`|e7ace19383856f6361f6f85be215c636aa	I will buy something that still has a tag on it.

Try buying Salon quality curl defying shampoo and conditioner. Some may seen expensive but you don't have to use as much as store bought product and the bottles are usually bigger. Also a leave in conditioner for curly or frizzy hair is good. It helps tam the curls.

Also, there is this stuff called Nail Envy or Starting Over that REALLY strengthens your nails, especially if you took your acrylic nails off and your natural nails are weak as a result. Eating lots of protein is good because nails are made out of keratin, a protein.

Okay. So let's get started shall we? First off, pastel colors and vibrant colors. They don't have to be light colors, just solid colors. Blue is really in this season (turquoise, cerulean) and I really like wearing blazers with maybe a basic color (white, olive, beige) with gold/silver accents on a shirt underneath. Then I would pair it off with a skirt for lighter weather or some jeans for worse weather. Heels (bright colors, and a basic black pump) and Mary Jane flats. I'd say go bold and use some patterns (plaid, stripes) and TRY ON CLOTHES. Hehe. For a usual day, just wear a tee shirt (form fitting, loose) and a pair of jeans. One thing, though, is to not have pure blue blue jeans. It looks... odd. Go for either a light shade or a dark shade.|`|bYakT177aa	Maybe some dark of those colors you were talking about. It doesn't have to be light. Red, orange, blue would probably look perfect for your skin. Ummm, florals with white background and flowers of the color that doesn't necessarily look good on you. (So the colors wouldn't stand out too much on your skin) And fun shorts and tanks. Breezy white tops.|`|7x3b4hVFaa	Well i'm the right person you're looking for...lol!....Anyway, I think if you buy a sundress it could be a yellow or pink with flats (brown or white) maybe a small clutch purse with a pop of color.If you need more advice email me at reneruther@yahoo.com.

So nice choice!<br>  <br>  Pressed powder is meant to absorb oil so your face doesn't look shiny as the day goes on. Loose powder can be used as a foundation if you want to even out your skin tone or just to add a smooth finish to your skin. Concealer is for covering undesired spots on your skin, like blemishes or red patches. <br>  <br>  I personally don't find much use in powders, but concealer is helpful.<br>  Anyway, for a basic routine, I would go with these products from that line:<br>  <br>  1. Talc-Free Mineral Tinted Moisturizer SPF 15<br>  <a href="http://www.physiciansformula.com/en-us/productdetail/tinted-moisturizer/01123.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.physiciansformula.com/en-us/p...</a><br>  <br>  This will give you sheer, natural coverage and make your skin look nice and balanced.

Illuminating Veil<br>  <a href="http://www.physiciansformula.com/en-us/productdetail/illuminating-veil/02180.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.physiciansformula.com/en-us/p...</a><br>  <br>  Adds a nice, healthy glow to your face.<br>  <br>  That's really all I would put on your skin. The Mineral Wear line also has eyeshadows, mascara, and eyeliners if you wanted to play around with that kind of thing. Best of luck!|`|jWmnSXlLaa	foundation <br>  blush<br>  powder I prefer loose<br>  eye shadows<br>  after you play around for awhile then add some other things like canceler,mascara liners ect.|`|CdBoe8XSaa	primer<br>  foundation<br>  powder<br>  pencil eyeliner<br>  liquid eyeliner<br>  mascara<br>  sometimes some black eyeshadow<br>  haha that sounds like so much when you list it off|`|zDMGrWstaa	i just buy loose powder.<br>  liquid or thick foundations and councealers make your face look cakey and unatural<br>  a light powder looks more natural.|`|su37vnIXaa	I wear cetaphil mousturizer, then dream matte mousse foundation, sephora eyeliner, (if I feel like wearing eyeliner) occasionally maybelline colossal mascara. oh & MAC hello kitty tinted lip conditioner in pink fish.

These babies will set you back about $23 but they are fantastic and are very pigmented.|`|SZZkfVzbaa	That part of your eye is called the 'Rim" or more formally, your "Waterline".<br>  <br>  Use Revlon Colorstay. All eyeliners smudge at least a tiny bit, I'm not going to lie, and this one barely smudges at all. <br>  <br>  P.S. To easily remove all eye makeup, use Olive Oil and a cotton swab! It removes ALL makeup [including the eyeliner stuck at the roots of your lashes] and conditions your eyelashes.<br>  <br>  ?M.|`|CdBoe8XSaa	it's called a waterline, and I use Maybelline Unstoppable eyeliner on my waterline, it stays on a least a few hours
s8Kg0ciqaa	When school starts, it always means a time for renewal in teen fashion (read: a time to find a great new look!). The first day of school has passed, and hopefully, the first appearance you made after the summer break was a good one, because first impressions do matter. But never fear, there's always room for improvement! <br>  <br>  Keep things simple and classic, nothing in-your-face or over the top. It's okay to be a little trendy, but you have to adapt the trends to your personal style, or you'll end up looking like a major trend-chaser. Put on the confidence! If you don't have it, fake it. When you aren't doubting yourself, no one else will doubt you or your clothing choices. <br>  <br>  Create the Outfit <br>  <br>  If you wore a great killer ensemble for your grand entrance the first day of school, just make sure you back up your outfit and keep your dressing pattern consistent. That is, don't wear an ultra trendy, right-off-the-runway look and then turn around and wear simple jeans & a tee combo the rest of the year. <br>  <br>  Look good, but nothing too dressy or attention-grabbing (only exception is if that's the look you're going for the whole school year!). <br>  <br>  <br>  Here are several teen fashion looks to consider:<br>  Chic & understated: Black tee with dark denim hipsters, black boots, low-slung black belt, plus an oversized eye-catching necklace in turquoise, silver, or coral. Tres chic! <br>  <br>  One part western, one part sophisticated: Distressed boot cut jeans, fitted striped oxford (stay away from plaid to avoid a complete cowgirl look), fringed belt, and pointy-toe boots. Remember to coordinate shoes and belt! <br>  <br>  Athletic-inspired: Although a too-cute track suit is absolutely perfect for any other school day, it's just too casual. Instead, wear a sleek, colorful hoodie in terry or velour with a sharp denim mini, fitted tank, and bright new sneaks. <br>  <br>  Updated Gypsy: Change the vibe of serious chino trousers (low-rise, a little baggy, but still chic) with a hippie-esque embroidered peasant top. Throw on a few beaded bracelets and add a pair of semi-dressy kitten-heeled sandals. <br>  Add the accessories: Accessories definitely make or break the clothing. The perfect shoe & belt combination, plus jewelry is required for any great look. Here are five things that you need to fully accessorize this school year: <br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Fringe suede belt: Adds a rustic appeal to hipsters and a sleek tee. Turquoise. There's nothing better than a great turquoise necklace or cuff with black - such a clean, chic combination! <br>  <br>  Chandelier earrings: So elegant, yet so easy to pull off! These gorgeous jewels look just as great with an evening gown as they do with a feminine top and denim. <br>  <br>  Trendy sneaks: Required both for those stylishly sporty and those just plain stylish. A great pair of sneaks can take you anywhere. <br>  <br>  Boots: Whether you choose a sleek black or distressed brown leather style, the look will definitely be hot! <br>  <br>  Important stuff to keep in mind when considering the complete picture of your teen fashion look for school: Your school necessities should be funky and fresh, just like your style. Search for cool versions of old classics - denim or corduroy messenger bags, bright backpacks, cute notebooks, girlie pens. Look for femme backpacks at kid's clothing stores where there's lots of eye-catching pink, purple, green, orange, etc. Check stationary or office supply stores for stylish paper and pens. <br>  <br>  Also try re-decorating certain things: decoupage notebooks (add glitter, stickers, ribbon, magazine pics, and other pretty items), cover a binder with Autumn-ish materials like corduroy, or girlify a backpack with ribbons, buttons and fabric paint. <br>  <br>  Make a point that you don't get all dressy and cute the first day, and then every other day wear trainers and track pants. Plan an entire month out in outfits. That way you can focus on what school is really about - homework and important stuff (don't forget guys, friends, socializing.). <br>  <br>  Whatever your tastes are in teen fashion, let the Internet be your source for what's new, what's in and what's not. You'll find many, many online retailers and catalogers that specialize in the latest in clothing and accessories for teens. <br>  <br>  Have a great year!|`|7qTKREOmaa	Look in magazines, other people, TV  for inspiration. Don't copy them, but look at their outfit. What do you like about it? Pick a piece, if you like their shirt, find a shirt similar to theirs and personalize it. Maybe wear some cute flats with it, or a funky necklace. My favorite outfit is a colorful cardigan, with either a cool t-shirt, a tank top, or any other kind of shirt. Then pair it with bottoms, whatever you feel like wearing... skinny jeans, flared jeans, a pretty skirt. Then find aaccessories a bracelet, and a necklace, something that makes it special. And finish it off with shoes cute flats, sandals, sneakers(like new balance or pumas) even vans or your everyday shoes. Making an outfit is fun, you just start with one piece, and add pieces until your happy.|`|zuCWisD5aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KHKfRS_s30&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6KHKfRS_s...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWLm-r8fpw&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9eWLm-r8f...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X42IkLQbtxc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X42IkLQbt...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wGhsdg57Eo&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wGhsdg57...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAgKetP1G3s" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAgKetP1G...</a>|`|YQPulpK4aa	it would help if you described your build or body style and some things you are into.|`|YDDWUSIuaa	I think you should get like a cute tank top,<br>  you can get one at Kohl's or Aeropostale,<br>  and the ones at Hollister are also really cute,<br>  but they're just kinda expensive.

Haha. I sorta like brands. So unless you wanna spend an hour researching a few brands I name, I'll simple it down for you. 'Cool' style. There really is none. If you like to be bubbly, go to Delias. If you want to fit in, go to Hollister and Abercrombie &Fitch. If you want to be cute, go to American Eagle and Aeropostle. If you want to be classy, shop at Marc Jacobs. But really, it depends. For shoes, Journeys is great. Unless you want high heels. Haha. I won't bore you with my list of great shoe designers. But I really want to. But if you like it, and you can afford it, and it looks good on you, and you NEED it, buy it. Don't buy it because you think someone else will like it.|`|QSy2vDf8aa	Layering clothes can make it look like you put a lot of time into your outfit when really it's simple. Like a long tank top underneath a t shirt. Also adding flashy jewelry like a big necklace can play up a look. I'd also suggest going and buying some new clothes. Maybe something you wouldn't normally think to buy. Like a cute blouse over any pair of jeans with flip flops. Skinny jeans are a definite must, I think.

Being pregnant means having a gut...|`|AA11197832	I def. would of checked her butt the first second she said it.  Stick up 4 urself.. That's what us woman are made to do!!!|`|OdgoiIN9aa	UGH! How rude! I would be SO mad!|`|bT3EgS0Jaa	THIS WOULD UPSET ME,BUT IT NEVERR HAPPENED TO ME|`|7DJkwzKDaa	Awwww :[  Its ok don't worry about it!<br>  That person obviously wasn't thinking at all!<br>  What a jerk.<br>  Anyways, feel confident about yourself and just brush it off!<br>  Some people tell me I'm too skinny all the time and it gets on my freaking nerves!<br>  But chances are, by the next week I've forgotten all about it :]<br>  <br>  -Added-<br>  <br>  Oh and sometimes pregnant woman have a certain glow about them so maybe they meant that! :]<br>  There could have been many GOOD reasons why they asked you that !! :D|`|MbFS6XFQaa	HELL YEE-UH I WOULD BE OFFENDED! <br>  You should've been like "I don't know you, so why do you give a damn if I'm pregnant or not?"|`|P8dIznazaa	Don't be too quick to be offended.  I once asked a coworker when she was due, and it turned out she wasn't pregnant.  Her shirt looked like a maternity shirt, so I sort of assumed she was advertising that she was pg.  'Course, I just generally had that sort of thing on my mind, since my wife had recently had a baby and I was a proud new father.  Anyway what I'm getting at is this person might have misread something about your clothes or something.<br>  <br>  (Please tell me "aksed" was a typo...)|`|01kEv36Faa	Yes.  But take it from where it comes.  Thats a very ignorant thing to ask when its not VERY obvioius.  Everyone knows what a definately pregnant woman looks like.  So to ask this of someone that may have a slight tummy bump shows that theyre either a moron or just trying to be insulting|`|0BdTKNZzaa	I often ask fat people if they're pregnant just to see the look on their faces., maybe she was doing that.|`|0vlm2OZcaa	I would and you should start doing crunches.
TwXJS1thaa	I have tried kids true religion jeans. I also wear kids abercrombie jeans. I love both.|`|oIGuYhvbaa	the others should also be good. give them a try.|`|Bm5TLWgdaa	try aeropostale and american eagle. they should fit perfectly on you then. im a 32 30. a 5'5 guy. and they fit great. my girl is EXACTLY your size. they fit great on her. no bagging or being to lengthy. and if so. you can always go to a little oriental tailoring store. i specify because they seem to know better than any others i have tried.
qqQpPFRRaa	No, I do not think they are "slutty".<br>  Hooters are famous for their calender<br>  models, the same type as Sports Illustrated,<br>  and the waitresses are supposed to be<br>  live Hooters Models serving. Thats<br>  why there arent men serving, they gear<br>  this model stuff at men. Its not supposed<br>  to be taken in a wrong way. But like some have<br>  said you do get perverted old men coming in,<br>  but you learn to deal with that.<br>  I would go for it, I think it would be enjoyable.<br>  <br>  Its like Hollister and Abercrombie, you<br>  truly get a job there based on your looks.<br>  Because they call them "In store Models"|`|MToAgvtIaa	they look slutty kinda, just cuz of what the place is supposed to be like but i want to work there it seems really relaxed and such. like a good place to work at.|`|QevBVANtaa	One word... SLUTS|`|5692af2f5c1dd01adcc37c048efe2ca1aa	they eye candy for men..<br>  not much diff then a prostitute. lol|`|411c9e50db3e6aa419765275e1da7d4aaa	i'm not a lesbian, but they have nice bodies. and they are making money.|`|JTjL9eD7aa	Regardless of what any Hooters girl will say, the mere fact that these females desire to be portrayed as idiotic sluts who are incapable of doing anything but transferring chicken wings from a kitchen to a table of perverts is disturbing. I am not a feminist and could probably get a job at a Hooters restaurant if I applied, I just think it's absolutely disgusting and degrading. Apparently the notion of self-respect has remained absent from the minds of these pathetic women, and they should know they contribute to the problems good, self-respecting women face today in regard to defending themselves and their relationships against such disturbances.|`|4D335m8Qaa	They should hire more men. They try to act like it's not all about the ****, but if it's not, then why don't we ever see any men in those orange shorts?<br>  But if you wanna work there, go for it. Be prepared to deal with a lot of pervy old men.|`|2hDlR3Flaa	hooters hoes wats the diff.?lol but thts wat everyone i know thinks of them|`|yzIB8Cbiaa	They aren't slutty. They're making a living for themselves, and so happens to be that they've got a rack and are pretty haha.<br>  <br>  i personally dislike the uniform. the socks are so 80s!
COOzle6Saa	oh cool free dress day uhmm u need to wear something different but cool like leggings from aa with an oversized cardigan with a scarf and jewelry. And flats are cute as u said.

Ok I'm done but this outfit is rad seriously try it!|`|CmiM40gPaa	sounds cute to me!<br>  <br>  but make sure you add just a splash of color ... and this could be as easy as putting on a bright pink/purple or any colored necklace or funky earrings. your outfit sounds cute, but show people that you are not afraid to stand out by adding a splash of color.|`|oIGuYhvbaa	outfit sounds kind of boring. throw some color in or cooler shoes! flats are boring. good luck! jeans are also boring. find cool pants or bottom!|`|Wq61zNdYaa	That's too plain and like everybody else, buhh't if you must, then go ahead(:|`|6JzgBhRQaa	i like your idea i think its cute<br>  <br>  be comfortable and wear what you want|`|KVs7svp9aa	something to make you look cute|`|GykCnbR7aa	how about a cute dressy top with a short denim skirt and sandles or a sundress|`|4d52d758f45db34f29370d8ba6d5ec41aa	wear clothes.
a5ff5ZlAaa	VERY EASY!!!<br>  <br>  1. Hang your clothes dry, don't use dryer<br>  2. When u get home, change to t-shirts that are old and already in bad    shape since then you can keep your good t-shirts in good shape<br>  3. This might sound kinda gross, but don't wash you clothes too often.   Maybe wash it once after you worn in 5 times or if there is some ugly ketchup stain on it or something. If they smell just put some perfume or somthing on it.<br>  4. Wash your clothes in cool water, hot water takes colour away from clothes.<br>  5. If white clothes looses its brightness then put in hotwater with baking soda, will make your white t shirts sparkle again.<br>  <br>  I guess thats it..<br>  IDK wat else to tell ya<br>  GL|`|gC98RlU3aa	it depends wat kind of material they are-if it's cotton then it shouldn't be that bad, but if they are the shear material then it'll be a little different|`|yrkMVrbtaa	Have you considered the fact that if there a knit fabric and not of very high quality that they will stretch if not washed in delicate cycle and air dried? Higher quality knits will not do this as much or at all. I suggest you either buy a better quality of apparel or take more care in how you handle your clothes.|`|oIGuYhvbaa	material is bad then. i dont have problems with mine. also check your washer. maybe its a bad washer.|`|yqVRsJwWaa	don't put them in the dryer, hang dry them.

eow59EaEaa	From what I have experienced and from what my fellow makeup artist friends have experienced, dont' waste your money on makeup school. If you plan on working in a salon, then go for your cosmotology license. If all you want to do is makeup for print, commericial ,runway, etc. the best thing you can do is find a working makeup artist in your area and ask to be their assistant. You will learn so much just from being on set and learning set etiquette and tricks from the makeup artist.<br>  <br>  My first job was working at a makeup store, and I learned how to apply makeup to different skintones which has helped me out alot in the makeup artistry field. You will have to do a lot of free jobs first before you start getting paid (you will need to build your portfolio up) but if it's what you really want to do, it will be worth it.<br>  <br>  I have done fashion shows for Billabong, I've done makeup and hair for a movie, I've done lots of commercials and I have done makeup for a lot of magazines. It's worth it, but you have to be willing to put in a lot of free work for a few years. Good luck!|`|SZZkfVzbaa	I'm 14 and LOVE makeup :)<br>  I've been doing my own Makeup since I was literally like 9.<br>  It's so much fun!<br>  <br>  I'm obviously not a Makeup Artist, but you'll have to take a Cosmetology course through University. <br>  <br>  ?M.|`|bhyUX6kkaa	I'm a makeup artist and first of all I admire your passion. You'll go far with that and an open mind.<br>  Here's how I did it:<br>  When I decided I wanted to be a makeup artist I didn't have the kind of money it takes to go to a school like MUD. I didn't want to give up on my dreams so I did a little research. I found out that makeup artists make really great money from working at private events like weddings. This is where the money is, unless you're a huge makeup artist like Joe Blasco. <br>  I found a really great at home course that was designed specifically to teach people beauty makeup and how to work at events like above. <br>  it only cost me around $150 and with a little practice I was working as a makeup artist. Now I make that great income with out having to pay back thousands in loans and with the money I make I go to special courses of interest. Like special FX work shops for a couple days that are only a few hundred. Slowly, as I get better I'm getting more and more projects dealing with all types of makeup.<br>  <br>  The truth about makeup is like any other artistic profession, if you have the skills and talent and work well no one will care where you went to school. I get work based on my portfolio and recommendations, not whether or not I went to a fancy makeup school.<br>  <br>  Just keep your drive and passion and love what you do.<br>  <br>  www.theeventmakeupartist.com|`|9najmVapaa	Of course you can achieve your goal!<br>  <br>  Feel free to email/IM me with your specific questions at thebecbec@live.com as i'd be more than happy to answer them (whether they are about the job itself, or actually makeup related =])<br>  <br>  Good luck!
XaYHMNusaa	It's possible that the diameter of the jewelry isn't wide enough for your lip.|`|cF2Wa1tqaa	maybe the jewelry is 2 differnt sizes|`|g7p4Qityaa	Maybe it was a little too early to change the jewelry. Ive found that it happens sometimes with my piercings, where it will get irritated/swollen if i change the jewelry too early. Just make sure to keep cleaning it as you have been and hopefully it'll feel better in a few days. If it doesn't and you develop an infection, you may have to take it out. No worries, I believe it takes about two weeks to heal up fully, and you can get it re-pierced then. (I had to do that with my eyebrow) Good luck!|`|NdWTVdFzaa	If it's only been a month they are not completely healed so it's probably just irritated from the jewelry change.<br>  If it really starts to bother you, you can have your piercer take a look at it.
jez0O0bXaa	The right connections. You have to work at getting the right contacts.|`|eow59EaEaa	Depends on what state you live in, but generally you have to be part of the union to be able to work on large movie sets (SAG productions). If you are interested in independent films, you should first try and assist under a makeup artist that is already working in the field and once you are comfortable on set, try and contact any director or producer who are looking to build a crew and let them know you are interested.<br>  <br>  Craigslist generally has alot of film students/low budget films that need hair and makeup. Good luck and have fun!

I suggest you try experimenting with your hair before you go on this trip so you can see what styles you like and what you dont. <br>  <br>  I find brushing my hair with a hair brush when it's wet makes it a bit less boofy, otherwise you can try tieing it up because it makes it look neat and cute if you leave your layers down a bit, if you get what I mean.

g5pZhzeoaa	Punk is not so much a style but a way of life.  It is about expressing yourself and being proud of your individuality.  Punk has been known to many as "hooligans" and "troublemakers", when in reality that is not exactly what it is.<br>  The most "punk" you can get as far as style is wearing whatever you want, and being proud about your selection.  It is more in the way you carry yourself than anything you wear.<br>  :) Hope that helped!|`|XHweMNNkaa	You can't. That's like saying "how do you pull of dressing like a lumberjack without wearing plaid or boots."|`|cxVmq2kraa	Punk isn't a fashion... its a life style.<br>  Not a easy one at that.<br>  If you can even manage to LOOK like a "punk" then you will be glared at all day and people will disrespect you.<br>  Many people will say "Oh no but I never judge anyone".<br>  I dare those people to see a few kids who go to my school and not to judge them.<br>  Punk is centered around music i.e The Exploited, G.B.H, A Global Threat, Minor Threat, Subhumans.

zih1Weanaa	Not that I agree with it, but clothes seem to flow down the runway better when models are super tall. There is more fabric to play with, and their legs look great in jeans/underwear/skirts or whatever. Also, they (super tall people) are usually more proportioned on top and have a long torso and a long neck. <br>  I think tall in real life is awkward (I am short), but models do make clothes look good when they are tall.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If you are a designer, trousers have a much better flow when they have a 35" inseam vs a 30" inseam. A long dress looks better on a tall model because that much fabric can overwhelm a smaller frame.<br>  <br>  Models exist to show off the clothes and designs. Models are nothing but walking hangers|`|lAmNQBunaa	america's next top model is currently casting for models 5'7 and under for next season ;)
67K4awwDaa	Tomboy is used to refer to either one of those, a girl who dresses or acts like a boy, or a girl who is athletic and likes boy things.  It's usually used to refer to a child or young teen.  And YES, girls that are tomboys can definitely be considered attractive.  Some guys think girls that are the athletic or outdoorsy kind of tomboys are even more attractive.  Girls that dress as boys are not necessarily considered more attractive.  It's all in the eye of the beholder, though!<br>  <br>  You can be called a tomboy as a kid if you dress like a boy.  Sometimes people say that someone who has natural features that look boyish is "androgenous", but I don't think that boyish features usually means you are called a tomboy.  For the most part, tomboy has to do with how you act... if you a girl who prefers playing in the dirt, playing sports, and hanging out with mostly boys and hate doing "girly" things and wearing dresses, you are considered a tomboy.|`|4d3Md9pnaa	I thought tomboys usually referred to how a person acted?<br>  And a little bit into their clothing style, because they don't dress all girly...?<br>  <br>  Tomboys are just girls who have more boyish tendencies.<br>  Of course they can be attractive.|`|jL688SnKaa	Um what? It's just a stereotype..|`|1OEDcz6Raa	i think a tomboy refers to personality. like what they do- rather than how they dress. i ride four wheelers, hang out with guys. and i still wear makeup and straighten my hair|`|NTxx4gBNaa	I think you're confusing tomboys with butch lesbos.  Tomboys can be very hot, but butch lesbians are quite nasty.|`|kiDys3dGaa	ogrescar obesedepression|`|XvK1mYtQaa	YES DEFINETLEY!!<br>  i'm a tomboy and being a tomboy has nothing to do with how you look it's more about how you act<br>  i'm a hockey player who isnt afraid to have eating contests with my friends and i hate to wear skirts and makeup but then i am considered to be one of the popular girls in my school so tomboy doesn;t really refer to how someone looks just how they act

It gives a more elegant feel. And I think smoky eye makeup is prettier because it gives kind of a mysterious look. And short cocktail dresses may make you look more slutty in my opinion, so I would go with a tighter gown. (more elegant) and probably pumps would look better because sandals may be too casual.|`|UUx74K5Caa	Flat ironed hair is very elegant if done right, add some smokey eyes and a "little black dress", minimal jewelery and you simply can't go wrong.|`|t6azk5sUaa	straight<br>  smoky<br>  short cocktail<br>  pumps

XvvAfDAraa	No matter what you wear, not everybody will like it. It's sad but it's true. On the bus today I saw a boy wearing a pink shirt and I thought it looked good and was thinking of buying some pink shirts.<br>  <br>  Now, ofcourse you got the mean comments from the guys who are homophobes (not calling you a homosexual), because pink is often associated with girls and either gay males, generally.<br>  <br>  I say keep wearing it, forget the mean comments and wear what you think looks good!|`|r7RJQfjGaa	i don't really care too<br>  Its just a color, and i don't think a color can prove anything to a person's personality.|`|mtyhSPi9aa	i feel uncomfortable with guys wearing HOT pink<br>  the dark pink colour<br>  thats just out of the question<br>  <br>  but if you're talking abt light pink<br>  i think it looks pretty nice on some guys|`|AjPbtm7oaa	They're homophobic|`|cWrARpyAaa	There not man enough to wear pink x]<br>  <br>  guys who wear pink are so hot no joke :]|`|1OEDcz6Raa	it looks gay.|`|Istd1Vgnaa	1) I  think it ok sometimes for a guy to wear pink, but it depend on how you wear it, but you probably was wearing it like any other shirt. (am i right)<br>  <br>  2) A lot of gay guys do wear pink. (but i bet u wasn't thinking it like that)<br>  <br>  3) Your are right it is just another color but a lot of guys think it a girly color. (cause girls wear it alot)<br>  <br>  4) Next time you wear a pink shirt or somthing that they think is gay just beat them up (it probably be worth it)|`|CtrvMQItaa	i dont mind when guys wear pink. i dont have a problem with it. if they want to they can. some guys think its gay. or is wrong because pink is a girl color. but you were confident enough in yourself to wear pink to school. so thats a great thing to have high confidence.|`|bipLaDk7aa	pink gives girlish look. some guys may look good in pink( lighter shade of pink) but  baby pink...sucks. pink is a softer colour which would look nice only on girls. Colours like black ,grey ,etc gives a tough look.|`|630bf8bc84ff86010c6988a63316554eaa	Because pink is a girly colour and a lot of tough guys wear pink to protect their homosexual tendencies... it looks really gay... people will think your a homo if you wear pink, purple or yellow t shirts|`|UBu2Bvymaa	i dunno man but i wore pink a couple days ago and got a ton of compliments from girls. in all reality the guys are either jealous or they just like to be assholes|`|9kwzNM2paa	i love guys who wear pink, its super sexy, no joke.
0IeUBkciaa	Well, the base color has to be darker, definantly; and in order for your highlights to pop out, you have to get them lighter.

NO BOOTS! anything else would work fine though. make sure u can walk in them good enough to make it from wherever he sees you at to the bed though.|`|vlvOkbaAaa	You don't have to have a specific color of slippers or just don't wear any shoes.|`|hpYwgDyeaa	*** me red, stiletto pumps|`|hptrJK3aaa	You don't wear shoes with lingerie, you wear slippers.  There are some with a small 1/2" heel and they have ones that go up to 4".  White.  Anything other than white would look odd and out of place.|`|JTjL9eD7aa	Whatever you chose, which most certainly must be pumps, should match exactly with your lingerie.  Perhaps white-lace round-toe heels?  In this case, 3-4" heels would be appropriate. Have fun ;)|`|xrEIAD2aaa	They have these really pretty shoes at Fredricks of Hollywood.

dY6HroZ3aa	Ok ..Even though they seem to be used for the same purpose,  some of these cleansers are used for different skin types. It also depends upon your skin type and level of acne (minimal to severe).<br>  <br>  If you have too oily skin and prone to acne, then go for Clean and Clear and neutrogena.<br>  <br>  Clean and Clear cleanser with Benzyl Proxide is mainly good for removing blackheads<br>  <br>  Aveeno Ultra Calming Foaming Cleanser is good for minimal acne.|`|dv8267AAaa	I probably would look more into Murad, Aveeno, Dove and Clean and Clear<br>  <br>  I'm not too sure about neutrogena at the moment.|`|41BI6dDkaa	I love Neutrogena!|`|ThfO8bROaa	FROM MY EXPERIENCE I WOULD SAY "CETAPHIL".

xiCWot0Aaa	getting rid of black head can be very pricey you can go out to the store and buy these pads that u Stick it on can rip it off then the black head will come off, but lately i learn for Ellen that you can put glue ( just normal glue) and place it on where the black heads are then rip it off and they come off. i've tried it before and it works!

WjZszr2laa	dont put anymore color on it! color on color will get darker!! wait it out and shampoo everyday.. temporary color lasts depending on the porosity of your hair or in other words, how good ur hair holds color. it will fade over the next couple weeks or so. jus keep washing!!|`|FGDC2KZ7aa	You can always add some brown highlights to even out the color so it is not as black, or you can just shampoo it like 1723908 times a day [which I would not recommend, because it would strip your hair of its natural oils, and then your hair would produce EXTRA oil, and then you would have extremely oily hair.], or you can bleach your hair, and then dye it your medium colored brown again. However, the last option may also ruin your hair (make it dry) verses the first option. <br>  <br>  Highlighting your hair and bleaching your hair will both cause damage to your hair, but if you REALLY hate your hair color that much, it may be worth the damage.|`|oLj0VTX5aa	If you redye it or try to lighten it with bottled dye, you might make it worse.  <br>  <br>  I did this to my hair, too.  I went and bought "sun in," which works with heat, and I used that to lighten it a little with a hair dryer.  The only catch - it will lighten your natural hair when the stuff starts to wash out<br>  <br>  Otherwise, the best thing to do is wait it out, or you could try shampooing it again, but leaving the shampoo on your head with a towel over it.  I am not sure if it would work, but the soap might help take it off - kind of like soaking a stain.|`|Ovn7040naa	Go to a professional...shampoo will not make it go away, you cannot lighten color with another color, bleaching at home will end in bad results as the lightener will lift it to an orange color...then what are you going to do, you will end up at a salon to fix a color gone even more  wrong and will cost you enormous amounts of money. go to a colorist in a reputable salon now before you try to fix it yourself. It will cost far less if you go with what you have now...|`|S6gootCBaa	This might be really bad for your hair, but if you really want the color back to normal, you might want to consider buying some hair bleach, then buying a shade of hair dye that is close to what you want.<br>  <br>  Here is some hair bleach that might be worth trying: <a href="http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/store/product.jsp?FOLDER%3C%3Efolder_id=2534374302028578&PRODUCT%3C%3Eprd_id=845524441936070&bmUID=1236403368351" rel="nofollow">http://www.hottopic.com/hottopic/store/p...</a>|`|Hpv4TqNIaa	once you go black you never go back, that's what my hairstyle st always tells me. you have to go to the salon to have then lighten it a couple times to get it back to your color.<br>  <br>  its quit a hassle but that's what you have to do.|`|bV1vu5Z1aa	Take really good care of your hair for a week or two (if you dye it straight away it'll end up way more unhealthy than if you wait for a bit), then dye it back to your natural colour or a colour of your choice.|`|SUzxFZYxaa	I DID THAT ! I had medium brown hair too, and i just washed my hair with dish soap, it works ! it turned to a dark brown after a week, but make sure to use conditioner after so it doesn't dry out.|`|7Nlp17x6aa	They sell color removal at walgreens.

Temp colors do wash out after time, usually by next week it will show improvments, its not worth damaging your hair by dyeing it or putting harsh soaps in your hair to get rid of it. You could do a test of a few strands by putting pure fresh squeezed lemon juice and see if it removes any color, thats about it. Use hair that is under neath incase it turns  a color you dont like. Leave it in as long as you like, just monitor it every half hour or so.|`|pLD3pYsuaa	U should dye it back|`|JRRsjByCaa	buy some anti dandruff shampoo, it helps to take most of the colour out of the hair (just don't buy one thats for colour treated hair). you're going to have to just keep washing it until it lightens up.|`|BMMMNnAQaa	bleach it blond and then dye it back your natural color brown.|`|yXx1nB0Qaa	Bleach it if that don't work shave it all off and invest in a nice wig.|`|8eeKI0h0aa	Cut it all off: It is a liberating experience.|`|JTjL9eD7aa	BE CAREFUL if you lighten it. It is SO easy to totally kill your hair... I mean, if you over process / bleach / lighten it, your hair will not be able to withstand all of the chemicals and will simply break off. In no time you will have lost a few inches of hair. Yes, this happened to me. Just give it time... when it starts to wash out, try to lighten it A LITTLE... nothing drastic. Start using shampoo and conditioner that moisturizes your hair and is good for damage and repair... start using extra conditioner, too, and I would make sure to get a little trim before to strengthen it as much as possible before adding more chemicals. This might all sound extreme, but my hair dresser would stand behind me 100% if she read this... not doing any of this, with my old hair dresser, was the worst mistake I have made with my hair! It has taken two years to grow back and become healthy again. Good luck!|`|zOU5fNHWaa	It came out black cuz you got the wrong pigment base, Some colors are ment to color and some are ment to coat and blend. Did you buy it your self or did you ask a profetional at a salon. I belive they have bleach kits that are weeker then normal and ment to only take off a few shades.

1snKZafVaa	i really think a lighter shade would suit u, but i think u should do this really gradually and when eventually at lightish caramel i think u should leave darker tones through it.
WewCtMpzaa	Pure preference. Some are very proud of their military uniforms. But they wear them a lot, and Kilt is seen as something special, not to mention as unique.<br>  <br>  I didn't marry in a Kilt, and kind of regret it. I did have a bagpiper which was awesome. To this day, all who went to my wedding remember the bagpiper, and recall our wedding really well. It was a standout wedding. I also get calls, not so much after all these years for referrals for pipers. In a few more years I will probably do weddings and funerals myself as a new and accomplished piper myself.<br>  <br>  I believe Kilts are the same thing being special and standout, if you are not in an area that everyone gets married in Kilts every weekend. Here in Texas you could probably count them on one or two hands of the thousands of weddings that take place each year.|`|oIGuYhvbaa	military.|`|zjEN7nylaa	<a href="http://answersgetinthis.snappingshots.com" rel="nofollow">http://answersgetinthis.snappingshots.co...</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.

You would probably look just fine with gauged ears, but your style from the pictures makes me think that you probably wouldn't want to go very big.  Using the tapered jewelry will probably make gauging more comfortable for you.|`|a1afe5463de09fa06f318ec679def139aa	no, dont. ur very pretty, and poking a large hole is just gonna ruin that.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Au3WASKKilqQEOniQxxA1Lrsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090306211128AAo2R78">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|XaYHMNusaa	That's completely up to you.

I hav brought a 7cm long tatoo and m gonna put it on my left arm up. Near my left shoulder. Cuz it looks more cool there. If u wanna put a tattoo hen try to put it near your shoulder. It looks more cool than the wrist or near wrist. Pink paws prints would be a great idea.

cpOMMZffaa	yes, a feeling of belonging is like feeling you're a part of something that makes you feel good.|`|iTTS06IKaa	I believe it IS a feeling. Belonging is the feeling you get when you are on a team or group of any kind, like a sports team, dance team, band, or just with your friends. You get a sense of belonging when you are completely comfortable with yourself and the other people you are around. You can say what is on your mind freely, and are able to be happy and genuine. You get that feeling when you are a part of something and form close relationships.
ba698d8451b8206312f913a19450f500aa	You somewhat answered your question with IMG. Ideally, being accepted into a high-profile agency like IMG, Wilhemina, Ford, Elite, is going to help you establish as a top model. Only a select few high fashion models make a good amount of money, and Victoria's Secret models are without a doubt the highest paid in the industry as they are more of commercial models. If you're an Angel, you can make millions a year (most of the Angels are on the lists of highest-paid models on Forbes). For the other models, you just have to be very luck and have the face and look they're searching for.

HvbIE03saa	Once the skin is burned, it's burned. After you've removed yourself from the source (the tanning bed) the burning process stops within a short period of time. So, really it shouldn't get worse.<br>  <br>  Even though the aloe vera is expired, you can still probably use it, just be sure to shake it up because the alcohol could have separated (if it hasn't be used) and that can hurt your skin. If it's just a light sunburn though, you may not need to do anything at all, just wait for the skin to turn.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that the tanning process can turn the skin red for a short while after tanning from the blood rushing to the surface (especially if you're using certain tanning lotions - tinglers) and that could be the red you're seeing and not actually a sunburn. Especially if you don't have a history of burning.|`|GINmkQMfaa	SUN TAN LOTION maybe|`|zt70x6NYaa	Even though the aloe has expired you can probably still use it. If it really hurts you could take some ibuprofen.  Stay out of the tanning bed until it has healed.|`|SMF7R42Caa	You mention Aloe Vera.  It is very good.  Do you have an aloe vera plant or know someone that does.<br>  <br>  I use an after sun gel. One of my favorites is the blue gel -- After-Sun Replenishing Gel.  It cools the skin  and is formulated with botanical extracts rich in soothing antioxidants, the gel absorbs quickly, replenishing moisture to the body. Skin feels smooth and refreshed.<br>  <br>  Maybe start wearing a suntan lotion before going into the bed.|`|Pcg5Nzztaa	you need to get a hamster and just cut a snippet off of his hair and create a magic potion. all of this can be found in hogwarts:a history|`|dY6HroZ3aa	Medicinally Aloe Vera is the best option. Try getting one and apply it.
iTTS06IKaa	First of all, if you have split ends, you should get a trim. That's probably the last thing you want, because you're trying to grow your hair out, but it will make your hair look SO much better! Split ends are no good, so you should get a small trim (nothing big!).<br>  <br>  To make sure you don't get split ends again, use a special shampoo. Just go to your drugstore and look for the shampoos that are specially labeled to do that. You should definitely use heat protection before straightening it. Also, natural hair looks really nice! If you have naturally wavy hair, just go with it! <br>  <br>  As for growing it...make sure you get daily vitamins. If you get all the nutrient you need, your hair will be healthier. Besides that, there really isn't anything to do besides wait it out. Hair only grows an inch or two a month.|`|YS2I9y2haa	I made a mistake when I was nine and got a pixy cut. <br>  <br>  Get it trimmed (like 1/4 of an inch if possible) every 3 or four weeks. I did it every 6, but sometimes it works better closer together.<br>  <br>  Drink lots of water, and before bed "massage" your scalp. It actually works.<br>  <br>  Take "hair skin and nails" they improve the look of "hair skin and nails" and help your hair grow longer.|`|zt70x6NYaa	First, you need to get the split ends cut off.  Next, find a shampoo that will help prevent split ends.  Deep condition your hair weekly.  Also, drink lots of water. You gotta take care of your hair to prevent the split ends or else you'll have to get it trimmed more often.|`|FyWvDqYraa	Arghh I was in the same situation but I am still desperate for my hair to grow long. I find not straightening it as much helps alot because it keeps the split ends away and I found it took longer when I had the split ends. <br>  <br>  Surprisingly my hair grew heaps faster when my hairdresser cut my splits off, even though I had shortish hair for several weeks. <br>  <br>  I just tied my hair up and left my layers down so it looked more interesting, maybe you should try it if you need to get your hair cut even shorter.<br>  <br>  I'm afraid there's nothing like shampoo or conditioner that helps hair grow longer, if there was I'd have my hands all over it :P.. but I highly recommend you get rid of your split ends before you try anything and try to stay away from the straightener / hairdryer. <br>  <br>  But I dont understand why you need the straightener that much if you have straight hair.. I would kill for staight hair ! It's not nice waking up every morning looking like a monster.<br>  <br>  Maintain a healthy diet.. make sure you have heaps of protein and vitamins and your hair will grow back in no time.<br>  <br>  Good luck.. let me know how it goes|`|2hDlR3Flaa	dont straiten it every day u have to trim your split ends of and take  daily vitamins becuz hair is basically protien ...idk some ppls hair grows faster then others like three years a go i got a bobby cut now its down to my butt.and shapoo take all the nutrients out of your hair after tht conditioner revives it.if u REALLY want it to grow dont even straiten it becuz no matter wat it will damage ur hair so just wear ur hair in a bun for the next couple months unless its specfiaql occasion|`|FGDC2KZ7aa	I think you should trim your hair a little at a time. Trim like half an inch, and it will grow faster than before. Each time you cut a little, it will grow longer than your original length. This worked with my friend's hair (:|`|0kzlfaygaa	just wait and only cut it a half of inch when you cut it|`|q6w8wnX2aa	I'd say just wait some time thats how I made my hair long|`|L5LliPhyaa	well i grew my hair out from my chin 8 yrs ago, now its to my butt. try not to straighten ur hair everyday. brush it in the shower w/ the conditioner in it (less breakage). trim it every 3 or 4 months. yea u migh have split ends. just go to someone else explainig u want a TRIM not cut. take off just enough for it to me healthy. i think constantly changing brands of shampoo and conditioner helps too. i feel my hair gets used to the same kind over again. I love Bed Head's orange color ones. a little expensive, but a nice treat in b/w cheapies. right now im using Tresemme w/ b12 and gelatin in it. try not to dye it too much either, makes it very dry. hope this helps =)|`|ebcWxC8daa	i know you dont want to trim it, but trim off the split ends. you have to if you want your hair to grow. if you dont trim it and then keep on growing it out, it'll keep getting more and more split ends and wont get longer because the ends also start to break off even when you don't notice it. since its always breaking off, its not really getting any longer because first, it gets really damaged, then you get split ends, then since its so damaged, it breaks and falls off. if you trim it then not only does your hair grow faster for a while, but also you wont have all those split ends. also use a heat protectant so your hair wont get split ends as easily and as soon so you'll have more time to grow it out before having to trim again. if you're using a heat protectant, you wont have to trim it TOO often. maybe 3-4 months? and if you wait it out, you're gonna end up having to cut off a whole bunch of hair.<br>  <br>  i tried to grow my hair out for the longest time, even while having split ends because i thought it would still just keep getting longer. i wanted my hair to grow out super long and be really pretty, it seemed to grow for a few months then after i started getting ALOT of split ends, it stopped growing. you can only see the roots growing because my hair was dyed, but the overall legnth never changed. i didnt know why, but now i know its because the ends always broke off. then when i finally got a haircut i had to cut off like 3 inches!! that's practically how much of my hair that grew! so really, in all that time that i grew my hair out, i had to cut it all off. so it went back to how short it looked last summer! dont make the same mistake as me hahahaha. but seriously! dont! i was so mad cause it was such a waste of time and everything.|`|qWvJY83yaa	Alright, there are a few key things to do for growing your hair longer. <br>  <br>  1) Split ends? Cut e'm. Go to the stylist and get them trimmed off. If it splits up to the root, then it'll stunt your hair growth. Also, trimming the split ends makes your hair grow faster. <br>  <br>  1a) Some products to consider using are:<br>  -Redken All Soft Soft Ends: This is a leave-in conditioner that you use once to twice a week. Just keeps it soft and shiny, and will help prevent split ends. <br>  <br>  -St.Ives Swiss Formula Hair Repair: This is another leave-in thing, only it's also sort of a heat-protectant, so you can put it in and blow dry it/hot iron it. Or, just leave it to dry naturally. <br>  <br>  -Andrew Collinge Perfect Endings: This is a heat- and weather-protecting hair spray. It's designed to protect weak hair from damage by regular blow-drying, straightening, and styling. Just spray it on (sparingly; too much will make hair look greasy!) and either blow-dry/flat iron, or just go on with your day as usual. <br>  <br>  Note: Refrain from blow-drying and straightening as much as possible if you're trying to grow your hair. Even with protectant, heat exposure is still heat exposure, so the less, the better. <br>  <br>  2) Vitamins! Specifically biotin and B-complex. I take a large regime of vitamins in the morning to aid hair growth, and the two best that work for me (and most people) are biotin and B-complex. <br>  <br>  -Your standard B-complex comes in bottles with 50mg per tablet. Take one of these a day. <br>  <br>  -Biotin comes in an array of doses, but I think the most common is 5000mcg. Take one of these a day as well. Notice that this is mCg, not mg. Micrograms are smaller than milligrams. Don't get them confused. Taking 5000MG would be outrageous! And probably dangerous. <br>  <br>  Now, I probably don't have to tell you not to overdose on vitamins, but I feel like I should say this in case someone calls me on it. And these are just standard, over-the-counter vitamins that can be found at Kroger (or any grocery store, I guess). Have a consultation with your doctor if you're concerned about them. <br>  <br>  Other things to do are eat more protein, and if you decide to take vitamins, get plenty of water so your kidneys and stuff don't have to work too hard. Kidney stones are no fun, my friend. Use a deep conditioner a couple times a week. Don't dye or bleach your hair (or do so as little as possible). <br>  <br>  I hope I helped. :3|`|EJAvOHxGaa	uh, you simply don't cut it.|`|44fe68ac48e4256fe9ab6ffbd1ee8375aa	If you have split ends you have to cut it before it gets any longer. Not a lot but just a trim. If your ends are split then they will keep splitting and breaking and not getting any longer. You should always use a heat protection serum or spray before straightening your hair. To protect your hair from split ends you can deep condition it once a week to make it really healthy and soft. Time is the only thing you can do to make your hair grow. I would say cut 1/2" off and give it a few months time.
U3fwQPcjaa	If you want a simple dress to pop, try accessorizing with different colours. hot blue heels with a green fake snake skin clutch and heaps of chunky silver blue, green and maybe some yellow bracelets. <br>  Don't be afraid to mix colours, who ever said that your shoes have to match you handbag?|`|gC98RlU3aa	i don't think it'll be too much red, it sounds cute|`|6JzgBhRQaa	i think a cute silver bracelet and earings to add a little bling and the red shoes and handbags and headband is cute<br>  but wear whatever you enjoy :)<br>  have fun|`|xMeMfmCMaa	Hmm. well lets see . you should where silver hoops earrings to have a little bling into your outfit. also cool it with the red . try to make your dress stand out.
AoJOEPX7aa	For your phone you can find Rhinestone stickers at like any phone store. If you have Verizon go to a Verizon store. If you have Sprint go to a Sprint store and etc. <br>  <br>  I would not use stickers because when or if you decide to take them off they will leave the little prints of where they were. You can find like a COVER that has rhinestones and you can look for those at like i said any phone company store or anywhere that sales your phone. If you buy a cover you will just have to snap it on and its not really stickers<br>  <br>  When you buy things at any store it is usually more exspensive but if you buy it online you have to pay the price and the shipping but it adds up to be the same. I hope I helped and good luck with finding the stickers or a cover!

QJRM2IEEaa	I'm a former manager of a tanning salon. First of all do you get color from the sun? If you don't get color from the sun it's highly unlikely you will get it from a tanning bed. Use tanning lotion too!Ask at the salon for a good lotion. They have samples and stuff and will know what will work best for your skin.  It hydrates your skin..Hydrated skin is more accepting toward color. I would start off going for 5 minutes maybe twice a week and then gradually increase week by week until you can lay the maximum time.|`|HvbIE03saa	I'm assuming you're referring to tanning in a bed and not sunbathing?<br>  <br>  If you're fair skinned and tend to burn, I would recommend 5-10 minutes for your very first tan (depending on the intensity of the bed you're using). After that first tan, if you don't burn, try doing 2-3 times a week at 10 minutes and increase it from there. If you burn after any session then reduce the amount of time or number of times for that week until the burn subsides. Remember though that you will probably come out of a tanning session pretty pink at first, this doesn't necessarily mean you're super burned and should reduce the amount of time...if the pink subsides after a few hours, then you're good.<br>  <br>  You can use a tanning lotion...all these do is help keep the skin moisturized because tanning dries the skin, and dry skin will sluff off (therefore losing your tan). There are many different kinds though (bronzers, tinglers, etc.), and I'd recommend asking the people at the tanning place which they prefer because they've probably used many of the brands they sell and can give you some good input.|`|NfIdKeJ8aa	speaking from someone who has around the same type skin.<br>  what i do is 30 mins in the sun every arvo or like whenever you have time during the day, but not in the very middle else you will look like a tomato use lots of sun cream SPF 30+ would recommend, and lie there. i usually use after sun gel cause if i do get burnt it won't peel :)<br>  <br>  you can also use tanning oil if you like but it attracts the sun a lot more.|`|nq7QXxIfaa	i think 12|`|CEAWQuiNaa	These answers are crazy!! Any respectable tanning salon would only start you out at 4 minutes. It is very easy to burn your skin. All tanning salons I have been to have a maximum time of 12 minutes depending on the level. DO NOT start out at 12 minutes unless the tanning salon you are going to has really crappy tanning beds, & don't change the bulbs as often as they should. A good salon will explain to you what tanning lotion is best for your skin type that you have & is best to quickly help you get the type of tan you want. Any lotion is good to use after tanning, since tanning really dries out your skin. Good luck! Hopes this helps you.|`|qkXwX897aa	15 minutes in the tanning bed and work you way up then start using tanning lotion to get darker.  And you wont tan wit out getting burnt first just don't overr do it a bake your skin off.... do what feels right|`|MXffm6znaa	im going my first tikme tomorrow.<br>  but my friends have gone so i know a little.<br>  well when you get there they willl help you. but put sun lotion on your butt and chest. And anywhere you burn really easily. not to much. but enough.|`|7InYcUSUaa	well if ur talking about a tanning bed you should start with 10 or 12 minutes like 3 or 4 times day..then gradually tan longer and more days of the week|`|5iNZ9gutaa	put a tanning lotion on, not oil as oil will cook your skin as it does on meat. then go out into the sun and stay as long as you feel necessary and keep re-applying if ure gonna stay out for more than an hour. use Palmers Cocoa Butter Natural Bronze Body Lotion and Natural Bronze Face after so you can maintain your tan all year round, i live in aussieland and it works for me, i come from switzerland so i was very light, but now i am really dark.<br>  hope it helps
NsePqNIEaa	I hope you're not going in a tanning bed.<br>  a) That's just gross because think of all the fat people who've been on it and<br>  b) Skin cancer.|`|Q3xhERA5aa	You can do it but you should know that tanning will really age you. The women I know who have beautiful skin stayed out of the sun and out of tanning beds.  Others who tanned have leather skin now.  How do you define beauty?  If you choose to go, Please put a cloth over your face and tan your body.  You won't regret it lateIr. I have had skin cancer from tanning.Not fun.  Not pretty.|`|HvbIE03saa	I'm just copying and pasting this from what I answered for someone else who asked the same thing...<br>  <br>  I'm assuming you're referring to tanning in a bed and not sunbathing?<br>  <br>  If you're fair skinned and tend to burn, I would recommend 5-10 minutes for your very first tan (depending on the intensity of the bed you're using).

It's only gross to think of the fat people who've laid on a tanning bed? You do realize they have to steralize the beds after each use, right? It's not like you're going to get "fat cooties".<br>  <br>  Vmd - If you apply sun screen when tanning, YOU WON'T TAN. Sunscreen retards the tanning process because it blocks the light (in the most basic of terms...I'm pretty sure if I get more in depth, 99% of you won't understand what I'm talking about).|`|A3I4UJQyaa	If you're going tanning for the first time and you're pretty fair skinned, start with shorter sessions (10-12 minutes). That way you can gradually build up a great tan without burning & peeling. You can always step up the minutes on later visits. <br>  <br>  Also, many places have different bed levels so start out in a basic bed and not one of the turbo ones. The bulbs can get very hot and of course  you may burn quicker.<br>  <br>  Make sure to wear some sort of eye protection. And remember to move them around every few minutes so you don't get weird tan lines around your eyes!|`|AA11538267	JUST GO FOR 10 MINUTES  THE FIRST TIME. YOU CAN BURN. YOU NEED TO GO JUST 10 MINUTES THE FIRST FEW TIMES. YOU CAN USE SUN SCREN ALSO BUT THEY DON'T TELLYOU THAT.|`|NfIdKeJ8aa	re apply sun scream regularly!<br>  you will turn into a tomato if you don't.<br>  try and not stay out during the hottest parts of the day.<br>  early arvos are a good time to go out.|`|5MTFXnGfaa	ew dont do it it ruins your skin especially if your fair <br>  <br>  GAWD just accept your white and theres no way your gonna go tanning once a week all year just to look orange and ruin your skin

cMZEmpp0aa	I actually don't think such a thing as a solid-colored yukata exists. I've certainly never seen one.

It has nothing to do with the traditions of weddings and funerals.<br>  <br>  Anime is a REALLY bad place to be getting actual kimono information from.

(No Personal Picture or statement.)<br>  And it all depends on how old you are. You want to wear something that gives you a confident air and forceful impact on how your personality is. <br>  <br>  But if you're skinny, you should try light colored clothing.<br>  Clothing that feels good against your skin, emphasize the shape of your body. Try to avoid clothes that show too much skin, but a little isn't bad. (Half an inch? Girl advice.)<br>  <br>  But if there's something about your body you would feel better hiding, dark colored clothing is the way to go. (Usually big people wear dark colors because it hides the little things that people pay real attention to)<br>  Get something that fits, make sure you try on clothing you want to get at a store. Don't let anyone else buy you clothes without you trying them on.

I danced for 15 years but I have a large chest. You should try some boy shorts. They are really comfortable and not too girly but still cute if that's what you're looking for. As for tops you should check out halter style tops. They look good on most people with an athletic shape.

lU8e0VQFaa	It sounds like you're asking which is worse, the one time big damage done by a perm or the damage done long term blow drying everyday. <br>  <br>  It depends, if your hair is super healthy and strong then a perm might not do much to it, or at least nothing a little babying and a good deep conditioner couldn't fix. however, if your hair is in bad condition, a perm might be too much for it to handle in which case blow drying it (and using a good heat protector at the same time) every couple of days might be better. And you would need to give your hair a break at least one if not two days a week. <br>  <br>  Either way there is going to be damage, what you want is to mitigate it as much as possible.|`|nGVoyPoEaa	I got a perm and I like it. It was an all-natural one by Paul Brown and it actually made my hair healthier and more manageable. DON'T USE A PERM DAILY THOUGH! <br>  <br>  I used to blow dry my hair all the time and now I don't have to so I have less damage.|`|RXD8kPkeaa	perms are harsh chemicals and theyre bad for ur hair!!! You wouldnt get a perm every day because your hair would fall out!!!!! But i dont copletley understand ur question though.
A5keqH5Aaa	It won't do everything but tonight drink a **** load of water like a few Liters. <br>  Have a warm shower don't use anything but water long enough to warm you all up then cool the shower till your skin all cools down. <br>  Once your out keep adding cool water to your face till your skin stays cool, wash your face in cold water every 15/30 minutes till you go to bed. <br>  <br>  That would be my advice but I don't have REALLY bad skin it's just how I improve it in a hurry.<br>  <br>  But you should see a dermatologist to talk about what and if you should be using moisturiser or soap.|`|D4NOrqM7aa	today:<br>  drink TONS of water and eat @ least 3 apples<br>  tonight: drink TONS of water, shower, wash face, rinse w/ warm water, apply honey mask, drink more water, get @ least 10 hours of sleep.<br>  <br>  honey mask:<br>  apply a thin layer of honey on entire face.<br>  wait 15 min.<br>  rinse w/ cold water.<br>  <br>  good luckerzz! this always works for me!|`|sw2R5A9iaa	drink lots water, eat a balanced diet, skip the make up, and see a dermatologist.|`|piE8mQM3aa	It's not really an overnight kind of thing. If your skin is that bad, you should consult your doctor and see if they could recommend a good dermotologist. But if you want something over the counter, take vitamins daily. Drink plenty of water. Make sure your skin doesn't get dry (over cleansed- I made that mistake once). I hear once if you mask avacados, honey, and yogurt (plain), that is a good face mask. I haven't tried it yet (haven't gotten around to it. Honey I hear is good for your skin. Another thing that helps me with really bad big zits is white toothpaste. Put it on (just those ONE big guys) and it will dry them up. See if that helps.
4BBjhHAnaa	Go to a better hairdresser and get them to even them out for you, or wet them and trim them yourself.<br>  One thing you can do until your bangs grow out and you can get them shaped nicely is to clip them back, either to one side or on top.  My friend once got her bangs cut too short and that's what she did.  It looked good on her.<br>  <br>  In the future, spend the extra $30 to go to a nicer hairdresser :)|`|5s3uFazlaa	go to the salon and demand a refund. that will make you feel slightly better. You could even ask them to fix it for you, but it sounds like they shouldn't, or maybe can't. :( sorry! let is grow out a bit and then go to a different salon.  I hope it turns out better.|`|SEMYH5Ccaa	cut it yourself. just start at the top and go down diagonally. fix the peices that are uneven. then it should be fine(;<br>  or go back to your hairdresser, or a different one and get it fixed.<br>  its as easy as that..|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I would go back to the salon, ask to speak to the manager, and tell her about this, you should either be able to get your money back, or they should fix it!!!!|`|NsTdWhgkaa	go back and demand a refund<br>  <br>  or just cut them youself, <br>  <br>  no use crying over spilled milk<br>  <br>  <br>  its not the end of the world.|`|WDLnNm7Maa	i think you should go back to the store and demand a refund. I think you should clip your bangs back until you get them fixed. Try going to a new hairdresser, don't worry it will grow back|`|ZyPqznLFaa	I would go back to the same place asap and ask for the manager. Bring a receipt if they gave you one, but don't worry if they didn't. Explain what happened and that you are unhappy. They should fix it for you. A different stylist should do it. If they try to get the same stylist to do it, tell the manager you want someone else. No crying! You have to be mature and tell them what you want. You deserve what you paid for. Don't let them walk all over you. <br>   Don't go somewhere else or you'll have to pay. Don't do it yourself because you could risk making it worse. Get the manager to fix it for fee. That's what I would do.
yjFLHfkAaa	i love manic panic. its reasonably priced. varies from where you get it(around 10 dollars) there is a huge variety of colors and the longer you leave it on the longer it stays. ive used it several times and its lasted about 2 months. hope i helped.

Its a once in a life time thing here and you don't want to let it go by. Just go. Leave early if you want but go.... At least you'll be able To know what it was like. I really loved mine. I had so much fun. the food is great and the dancing off the hook. i loved it! maybe you will too but you have to give yourself a chance. Go to your prom!<br>  <br>                                           GO CLASS OF 2010!!!!!|`|Nui0TEH9aa	The prom... I went to mine let me tell you about it.<br>  <br>  I got all dolled up, spent too much money on clothes I only wore once.  I saw my friends, talked to my friends, talked about how much we spent on "the magical night" and then we drove around in a car and ate a sandwich shop because the food at the prom wasn't very good.<br>  <br>  Will you regret not going to your prom, I highly doubt it.|`|XpHpeRGAaa	You may regret opting out of Prom. If you have bunch of friends in your own grade then you should go. <br>  <br>  I went to several Proms in high school, but not my own. My close friends were all a year ahead or a year after me. I had fun attending the proms of others and do not regret missing mine.<br>  <br>  Advice: Go to at least one, it does not have to be yours or even at your own school. going as a date was just as good for me.|`|c9c125c6d1996c1208ff4a9a289ff0fbaa	i dont think its a big deal in the UK, i went to my yr 11 prom, it was okay, nothing special that i will want to cling on to forever.<br>  i missed out on my yr 12 prom, and didn't care<br>  <br>  alot of the girls make it a HUGE deal, and its annoying getting all worked up about it, if you dont feel like going, then dont. you might change your mind, you still have a whole year.<br>  <br>  plus, so much expense for just one night|`|54fb3ea85549743b677d80a7f77b2b37aa	yes it is. think of it like this. It is you last major social event that you get to dance and hang out with your friends. All the other dances are low key..like homecoming or sadie hawkins.... Prom only comes once. the Last dance of senior year. enjoy it... after high school many people go their separate ways. Even friends that you kick it with on an everyday basis at skool. good luck!|`|mUhZxm8Jaa	Hi there, im also on the 11o grade and i'm not going either, tough here where I live prom isn't such a big deal, but begins to become kinda popular. I think its not so important, and sometimes is kinda dull and cheesy really. But thats just my opinion ;)|`|pmDQJ8RYaa	You really will regret not having fun in high school. Prom is a night where you can have fun and dress up like a princess! Lol, but seriously, you should go to prom. It would be a great experience for you and you will keep those memories forever. :)|`|XHtd6Lnyaa	Yes, I think that it is a big deal becuase there is only one chance you have to go. If you dont wan to go with a guy you can go with your friends. Hopefully this helps!|`|rm8DdSgaaa	no not really the only thing you might regret is not getting seeing all your friends one more time|`|jdRKZe18aa	It's a big deal for some while in H/S - once you are graduated and gone it really matters little in retrospect. I went to two of my proms and 2 homecomings - and looking back - it is a fading memory and no big deal. And honestly, it's just a big fat waste of MONEY better used elsewhere! ; )<br>  <br>  SO if it isn't a big deal NOW to you - it won't be later in my opinion.  PLUS you still have Sr. Year to go if you want then!|`|517360c1a1db979fb2f19bbb959f22eaaa	In the US, a prom's a one-time occasion during the school year to add a little grown-up glamor to a school dance and to make an evening of it with dinner beforehand. It's usually a way to close off the year. People usually invite someone special as their date.  <br>  <br>  Some people make it a big deal, others don't. If you don't go and you hear people talk about it the next day, you might feel a little regret that you didn't go. On the other hand, you won't regret it in your life.  They're a fun way to spend the evening with someone special, but tomorrow's just another day.|`|vl0HWTDJaa	Well if most of your friends are going they'll probably spend time planning it in front of you, then talking about how good it was afterwards so you might feel left out or like you missed out on something. I doubt you'll be regretting it for the rest f your life or anything but it'll probably be worth going to, I enjoyed mine!|`|a1WK8NtYaa	Nah not really, people make it out to be too big of a event.<br>  Its fun and all but its to much money lol.<br>  I mean dress, hair, shoes<br>  and some girls get tanned, toes and other things.<br>  Some take it over the top.|`|f3LrMhqWaa	i don't know about the U.K., but over here in Ireland, the debutante ball (or debs), is a HUGE deal, but i think more so for the girls, than the guys.|`|Xe94coYQaa	Nope.|`|L6wcyVwyaa	I live in england too and had my year 11 prom last year and honestly it wasn't that great, it was very expensive and turned out to be pretty average. However I do think you should go unless you know you're going to go to 6th form or college where you get a second one because otherwise you're missing out on one of those special things in life that you can't go back and do at a later date. You will regret it, so go!|`|QW4jdXGjaa	In the U.S. it's a really big deal. That's kind of understandable, because you get to feel like a princess and be with your friends for some of the last time. But at the same time it's all too  much money. You should just go to the senior prom. You'd only have to deal with it all once and it will feel much more important.|`|ogTM8gPEaa	i'm not going to mine and its in like 2 months.<br>  everyone making a big deal that i'm not going and its mega annoying.<br>  <br>  its not really a big deal in england but the girls do make a huge thing out of it.<br>  in conclusion, its stupid.|`|MTJs95Emaa	i honestly don't see what the big fuss is about it. I'm in my Junior year and we have it in a couple months...i'm not sure if I'm going or not.|`|zOtiAN3xaa	i went to my prom!! it was lame!! was a couple of points better than a cheeze disco! the only good thing about it was a had a *** with my formtutorr and then a good piss up after!|`|L5tWiYOFaa	No, a UK prom is nowhere near as big a deal as it is in the US, they tend to be really low-key affairs over here.|`|7qNJg8DTaa	Its not really a big deal, to some people it is, but it really doesnt matter..|`|MyjJaoHyaa	in UK, its not a big deal<br>  however in the US its like THE BIGGEST NIGHT OF THERE LIVES!<br>  <br>  so over-rated

lyp6JEcEaa	It is amazing how many people in yahoo answers answer questions and know nothing about what they are talking about. The lady who suggested using VASELINE over olive oil? OMG. I hate to burst her bubble but Vaseline is from the petroleum industry (think gasoline industry) aka MINERAL OIL. Mineral oil's molecular structure is TOO LARGE to cross the skin barrier so it CLOGS PORES. Would you rub gasoline on your face, I surely wouldn't. Sorry for the rant-lol. EVOO is amazing for your skin and yes can be used as a whole face moisturizer. Unlike store bought moisturizers that use synthetic, irritating emollients (moisturizers) Olive oil not only moisturizes your skin but has antioxidants that can help wrinkle and aging. If your skin is oily I would go with jojoba, coconut, hazelnut or grapeseed oils over Evoo, although using this as a makeup remover is perfectly fine. The cosmetic industry has scared everyone off of using oils because they are more EXPENSIVE. If they canget you to believe that natural oils are not good for you then they can sell you a crappy moisturizer with synthetic cheap oils and they make more money. Its a business not a charity. EVOO is perfectly good for your skin, it is better for dry skin types for all over application, but for removing eye makeup it would be perfect and even help keep away future wrinkles!|`|6Ss31wyBaa	No hun. Use Vaseline, its an emollient and won't hurt your eyes if it gets in them. It also doesn't clog pores and it works great.|`|8v40KEd0aa	Kinda messy!|`|lAmNQBunaa	yeap yeap i have! watch this video for it :)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc-8onVA5Jk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc-8onVA5...</a><br>  <br>  btw, she has a lot of great tutorials!|`|hQA8Ql21aa	Wouldn't that make your face oily?|`|ew8wxzYQaa	ive heard of it but im not sure how well it'll work. you could try it though.|`|vvVOZd18aa	hey, I tried Extra Virgin Olive oil and its great for me. It conditions  lashes, and moisturizes eye area. Be cautious while using it. <br>  1.Close your eyes.<br>  2.Dip cotton and squeeze extra oil from the cotton before wiping your eyes or don't dip the cotton completely.<br>  3. 3-4 drops oil will be enough for one eye.<br>  4. After removing eye makeup just wash your face,eyes with warm water.<br>  <br>  I am suggesting some videos,look at them|`|SnQljRBAaa	I've used EVOO as an eye makeup remover many times. I think it works pretty well. I am not a professional regarding its safety, but I think it's fine. I've never had an adverse reaction and my skin is pretty sensitive (dry, sensitive, minor rosecea). I personally think olive oil is good for the skin. I have no wrinkles around my eyes and I'm 37. I think that the EVOO is part of the reason.|`|nz6nHVkKaa	Yep, but that's usually for waterproof make up. Most waterproof make up removers are oil based. I suppose it would be fine on your eyes as long as you don't get it directly in it. I would also remove the oil after because it might make you break out in spots.|`|cfkuPoMaaa	Yes, I have heard of it. It works okay to remove the makeup, but it WILL make you break out. I recommend using a face wash to remove it.|`|bCjmjnqgaa	will definitly make you break out. <br>  <br>  just pick up inexpensive eye makeup remover- Rimmel is good. <br>  <br>  Or solution for contacts works well on me. although i often use vaseline

vzWnzCFEaa	Girls are very competetive towards each other; especially during adolescence. They are very sensitive to comments and feel like they are under constant pressure to look good. Call a girl fat, and while you might have forgotten about it, she's still stressing over it, call a girl ugly and she's worrying about it hours later.<br>  <br>  We constantly compare ourselves to other people and end up worrying about whether we are "too fat" or if our noses are too big etc.. <br>  I went on this stupid diet to try to be skinny even though I was already too thin too. Lots of girls too. We just want to be "perfect". Or maybe this is all just me who thinks this. Oh well..|`|93879989e22445fd6e208fa4fdd928f9aa	Insecurity. These girls think that being stick skinny helps them to fit in to the image that mass media portrays as beautiful. We all come in different shapes and sizes and realistically if everyone looked that way guys would be so bored from seeing the same type of girl all the time.

Some girls legitimately have eating disorders where they will view themselves as fat even if they're weighing 60lbs.<br>  <br>  to each their own though.  Some girls who are fat call themselves "curvy", and why do claim that "real girls" are fat and skinny girls that are in modeling aren't "real"?<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, the national average in the United States is OBESE.  That means, if you're average, you are fat.  5'4 160lbs...  I suppose it depends on your definition of "bone skinny" though, and some people do find that attractive.  But let's not negate the simple fact that most people are fat in the US, but when we see an actual "normal" sized person, we call them skinny.  We've had a skewed sense of reality and we've had a total loss of personal responsibility, so we're trying to shift it on everyone else with this same attitude that you're not only complaining about, but actually perpetuating.|`|2KC467tFaa	My husband wonders the same thing. It's in our face all the time. It's almost impossible to open a magazine, watch t.v., go to the movies, or walk down the street (ads all over) without seeing a super thin woman posted in multiple places. Thinness represents power, beauty, independence, strength, and control. I don't like it. I'm sure most women (other than those getting paid to be thin) also hate it. It's unfortunate. I'm hoping to do public speaking in schools and teach about health and nutrition in hopes of helping to change this horrible fad. It's very difficult not to compare ourselves to images of what we "should" look like. I'm struggling with the same thing. I'm healthy, and I know and respect health and nutrition. I still feel uncomfortable when I'm in a crowd of thin, beautiful women. I admit I'm afraid of being judged. I'm doing my best to work past that and accept myself for exactly how I am. It's not easy. I have gotten better and am beginning to appreciate a few things about myself. There's a documentary called "America the Beautiful" that addresses this issue. I have yet to see it.|`|CB4ag09Paa	Women think they need to look extra thin due to all the magazines, tv programs and other media that portrays attractive women as having to be tall and thin.

Further, in trying to attain that goal, women are endangering their health both mentally and physically. <br>  <br>  Being short and thin by nature myself; I've found myself still single and don't think of myself as more attractive than someone who weighs more.

I hope you get a lot of customers.<br>  :)|`|0rpN2419aa	You could send your website to all your friends and have an online party...some people are doing it that way now.  It is a lot more fun to have the parties and some one else's house though and serve lite treats while showing the products.<br>  They have some nice products.<br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|M80AhVVuaa	I don't sell party light but my mom used too it makes good money if you know what your doing overall good company.
WXExyAlWaa	It's inadvisable, they close up pretty fast. If you go to the store where you got them done you might be able to get these little almost-invisible things that will hold the holes open without drawing attention to them. Explain to whoever's working what you want and they should know.|`|uuPJ9xmNaa	No, they will probably close. Mine fell out for about 5 seconds when I was cleaning it and by the time I put the ear ring back in the back had already closed a bit.|`|OuOOy8v3aa	You won't be able to take them out after 2 weeks, they will heal and it will be incredibly hard to push them back in.<br>  You could just get a tiny tiny stud (Like for child's ears) and wear that.<br>  <br>  If i were you i would take it up with my Union Rep because males should be allowed the same rights as women.|`|RikCftYKaa	NOOO!!! don't do it! they will close up just enough to were you don't have get them re-peirced but you will have to peirce them yourself, and trust me that does not feel good!!|`|b5f9eada2ae1ecabcb567944edea3c27aa	You can try, but there is always the risk of them closing up or your ears becoming infected when you put them back in.|`|SEMYH5Ccaa	no, they will most likely close up. especially if you are constantly taking them out.|`|AA11140814	i made the mistake of taking my earrings out to early when i was 15, i got and infection and couldnt wear them anymore. its really painful.<br>  <br>  so i had to get my ears re-pierced at 17, the lady messed up piercing the right one and it got infected and it hurt sooooo bad.<br>  <br>  so at 19 i pierced my own ears and i took care of them really well and no infeciton or anything.<br>  <br>  ask your boss if you can wear a band-aid on it for the 6 weeks you need to wear it until it heals well. or get a clear, flat stud to take its place.|`|XXjcHdxxaa	ughh... depends on you. I can take earings out for 2-3 hours mine grow right back. some people can leave them out for months and it wont grow back. Some people get really tiny studs and where a band aid over them. most places as long as they dont show your fine|`|golzeqmuaa	don't wear any, its an abomination to god|`|pylXOP6yaa	yes. you can|`|c1ca6eab6eb710f98ed6848d2596f979aa	yes or u can use a straw from the brush to keep the hole but put it in rubbing alcohol
48e9baf113e4951f779199c900a19f63aa	In order to get your hair blonde, you generally have to bleach it or strip your hair of color, then dye it the blonde you want.<br>  Both are very damaging, but if you want the color to show up better, it's always best to strip the color out of your hair first. <br>  If you've never done it, I would recommend going to a salon.|`|8IWwoV5baa	I would go to a salon sweetie.  I mean, you could try doing it at home, but because the colors are so different, AND you're going from really dark to a light color, you'd risk making it either turn really orange & copper-y, or it barely doing anything at all and just lighten up your roots, or any other lighter colored hair that you might have.  I'd definitely go to a salon.  It might cost quite a  bit of money depending on the length of your hair, but they're the professionals, and they know what they're doing.  It's always worth it.  Then while you're there, ask them what they would recommend if/when it comes time for you to color it again; like if you COULD do it at home & it turn out right. And, if so, what products/methods do they recommend.  You gotta remember also, different hair types take to different colors better as well.  <br>  <br>  Regardless, always trust a professional.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<3|`|LM4vwHEyaa	i definitely think you should dye it like this! but because your hair is so dark, you will have to bleach your hair before, so i definitely recommend going to the salon for this procedure, as they are the professionals. first of all print off this picture when you are for sure you know this is the colour you want, then choose a really good salon you trust for this procedure, then bring in the picture to them on the day of your appointment and leave the rest to them :D<br>  <br>  trust me ... youll be much happier going to a salon, rather than doing it yourself!|`|Q9LSHMcZaa	Yeah I'd say expierment! Do you like the OC?
YFfdFewMaa	Black always goes well with purple to create a cool chique color combo. Those shoes and dress are gorgeous by the way :)|`|JdtD0Tvkaa	Love the dress! I would say silver. But I looked at the shoes and they don't have it, so black. Unless you wanted a crazy color. <a href="http://www.unforgettablemoments.com/Diana-Dyeable-T-Strap-Peep-Toe-Pump_p_56.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.unforgettablemoments.com/Dian...</a> these shoes are my favorite.|`|ayPAKhngaa	Claudia Satin Dress Sandal - French Vanilla|`|Vg1YugjEaa	the 3rd one by going across|`|XF2vVY3Uaa	Silver or black would be the classy choice. not gold.|`|NXnws50raa	bright red.|`|QKnilCNDaa	wear silver, black or gold heels or flats with it.|`|BThdUonXaa	bordeaux
