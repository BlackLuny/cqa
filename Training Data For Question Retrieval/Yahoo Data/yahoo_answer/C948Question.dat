20090128133745AAbQlX0	Business & Finance;Small Business	What would you do with an employee who WANTS you to fire them so they can collect unemployment?	This guy has been working at our family business for about 30 years.   He's from a not so nice area, he's had a rough life, and he's now an out of control alcoholic. All last year he would show up to work blitzed out of his mind, and we'd find him passed out in the parking lot.      My father gave him a talk and told him he had to straighten his crap out, and not to come back to work until he got stuff together.      He did some sort of program.      For the past few months, he's been back. But it's extemely obvious that he wants my father to fire him, so he can collect unemployment.   He hardly ever shows up.   My father refuses to fire him, because that'd be playing into that man's hand, and my father doesn't want to pay his unemployment.      How would you handle that sort of situation?
20090128133452AARfaSU	Business & Finance;Taxes;United Kingdom	How much redundancy payment would be due?	My husband has worked for the same company since he was 24 (Now 62). Looks like he is going to be made redundany. He has been on his notice before due to lack of work but previously it was rescinded.The company only pay the basic amount as dictated by the government, no enhanced payment. He earns a fairly high wage but understand there is a limit on the amount you can actually receive, last time around 1999 he was on notice it was something like 106 per week.  Someone told me it is now 350 per week for each week due up to a max. of 20 wks. Please could someone advise me if this is correct, exactly how many weeks he would be due as I understand at a certain age you receive a bit extra? Also part of his contract always said that after the age of 60 you lost 20% of any redundancy payment after age of 60. Again someone told me they think this also had now been changed.  I presume he would still be due 12 weeks notice but his employers normally makes any employees being made redundant work out this notice.  Any help would be appreciated.
20090128133816AAyTb3S	Business & Finance;Taxes;Other - Taxes	How should I do my taxes?	I'm just looking for a little help in how I should do my taxes.        Here's a little bit about me: 23, married, have a lot of interest on student loans for me and spouse, have 5 different W2s from employers, one of the W2s is from a different state than the other four, and I've made some money on the side from freelance work where taxes weren't taken out my checks.      I've never done my taxes by myself, but don't really want to pay a butt load for H&R or Jackson Hewitt to do it.  I can probably do it through the forms found at Post Offices, but I don't know which ones I would need.  What would you suggest I do?  Do it myself through the forms?  (if you suggest this, could you let me know which forms I need to get: 1040, 1040A, etc.).  Get software such as TurboTax? Go to someone and pay for them to do it?  Any other suggestion?        I feel like I'm so unprepared and never have been taught how to do all this stuff....

Im interested in vetinary services because i love animals.      the problem is....   for business/banking, i have no clue about the stock market and things that apply to it. I do not know what equity means,nor what mutual or government bonds are and stuff like that.      the problem for vetinary services is that i did only okay in science classes at high school (only B's) Im in my junior year right now of high school and i am not taking any relevant science courses, such as AP Bio and AP Chem. I did take biology, but that was a year ago.      i want to get into a really good college. If i decide to go for vetinary services, then the colleges might be reluctant to accept me because they see i did only average in science courses and did not have any junior courses that would benefit me in becoming a vet.      but if i get into a business school, im afraid that i would struggle because i dont know the fundemental ideas.      im 16, and in junior year of high school.   help please.

It will be all of our first apartments. I've done some research and I think I've got some prices down but I need help on $$$ info.      I'm aware everything will vary depending on location, but this is what I've brought it down to:      Internet (high speed DSL)- $15/m   Groceries- $200-$300/m   Rent- $700/m   Utilities- $150/m      The apartment its self would be 2 bed, 2 bath since they'd share a room. We'd do our own recycling and we don't eat a lot and I didn't include dine out (if we ate at the dining center on campus) considering that would be individual costs.      Two of us are huge computer people (I have three (Mac, PC, and an laptop), and he has a PC and a laptop) which we would probably bring along. We're not worried about furniture initially considering we'd likely bring whatever we had from home.      We'd likely run on cell phones paid for by our parents unless there was an amazing Internet/cell phone/LAN line deal offered to us.      That's pretty much our entire profile.   Can anyone else give me any other cost info or correct the information I have now? We're all pretty frugal.       Thanks!

Like many people out there right now, I've been searching for a job.  My law firm was downsizing last year and finally, they just had to close up.  It was hard because I knew the attorneys for a long time and it was a diffcult time to go through.  So, I've been sending out resumes, having phone interviews, going on actual in-person interviews and I'm finding the same story more and more.  They all say they are interested, they'll get back to me, they have one or two more candidates to interview, etc.  I do the things you are supposed to do, let them know I'm very interested in the job before I leave, send a follow-up thank you note, etc.  Now, let's see, I've been told I'd get a call back in a week or so, or that the budgeting process is not complete so they can't hire anyone or that they are working on second interview schedules or that I should not be worried if I don't hear from them right away.  If a good amount of time passes, why do they have to keep lying and make you think you MIGHT get the job?  Why can't they just be honest, let you down easy and let you know they aren't going to hire you so you can just move on.  I've been wating this week for so many calls from prospective employers that tell me they will get back to me but don't.  It's really tough and I just wish more people were honest instead of just ignoring you.  To me, that's worse.  Anyone else going through anything similar right now?

20090128145258AAml8Z0	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Technology	HELP! University of Phoenix--does it actually get people good jobs like a regular college? In medical billing?	*PLEASE READ* Ok please only rspond if YOU earned a degree from there or actually KNOW someone personally who has. What was your job search experience like after graduating? Did u get turned down a lot for not having a degree from a traditional college? What did u earn ur degree in and what are you doing now?      Ok, the resaon i ask is because my mother just started taking classes (actual classes in a building) through the University of Phoenix recently at one of their campuses near our home. She is persuing a degree in medical records/ medical billing. Now, after reading different forums on people criticizing the school and talking about how bad it is, I am a bit concerned that my mother may be making a bad choice by going to the University of Phoenix. She got laid off from an office job that she was at for 12 years just a few months ago, and in looking for a new job she realized that she needed a degree to work anywhere, so that prompted her to start taking classes thru UoP. She is a grown woman about 50.       Is she making a mistake? I am just woried because shes excited about taking classes there and I really dont want her to be dissapointed if she cant get a job after she graduates from there. Please Tell me your experiences! Thanks in advance!
20090128143433AAiC4qG	Business & Finance;Investing	Buying and Selling Stocks - What's the Risk?	I've been wanting to deal with stocks for a couple years now.  I have a very small understanding of how it all works though and would like someone to help explain something to me.      Here's what I'm most confused about: how people "lose it all" if their stocks do badly.      I don't want to do the Stock Market as a full-time career or anything but rather just earning a little extra every month - basically just a casual thing; I'd even be open to using a Stock Broker or something.  Say I put $1000 into stocks - the worst that can happen is that I've lost $1000 right?  I mean I can't end up losing more than I've put in, like $1001 or more correct?  I'm just kind of going into this as "I've set aside x amount of dollars that I can live without if I never see it again.  If I happen to make a profit, then wonderful."      There's still obviously a lot that I need to know before I deal with the Stock Market, but this is the question that has been throwing me off the most.

If your refund is not credited to your account by January 28, 2009, check with your bank to find out if it has been received. Please wait until January 28, 2009 before you contact us again because we are unable to take any action until then.      And the call disconnects.. Where is my money...

This morning I received a call from a collection agency, trying to collect a $224 debt that I owe to the university I graduated from 4 years ago. I freaked, but wasn't rude to the guy who called - still, I refused to pay, I explained that I graduated years ago, left behind no balance to be paid... and it makes no sense, considering that NO ONE tried contacting me in 4 years - and all of a sudden now it's in the hands of a debt collector??? He said it could be a registration fee from a dropped class, or a leftover payment for tuition... and that universities often do not collect until 5 years later, and he also said that maybe I wasn't contacted because I moved in the meantime - which I have - but a year after graduation!    After hanging up I remembered that I did register for a cont-ed class after graduation but dropped it the same day after I changed my mind and this was a week before school even started and there are no balances due unless you drop once you already start classes. How do I even prove this now, 4 years later? How do I fight this? I can't afford an attorney, and what infuriates me, I did nothing wrong, I shouldn't even have to!

We phoned the realtor it was listed with and when I asked whether we needed a buyers agent or something they said no, that we could do it all through them?      Is that correct, does that mean the realtor is actually representing the buyer and the seller? Sounds a bit odd. We're in Ireland so we don't know exactly how the process works there in the US. Thanks.

This apartment we looked at is a 3 bedroom 1 bath for $775 a month, they pay water,sewer,and trash, we pay Electric,phone,cable,internet,and so on. The rooms are pretty large,enough to get a king size bed and more furniture in. The kitchen is small hardly any storage,the dining room is a medium room,the living room is i think it's huge, and the bathroom is small and the toilet needs to be replaced because the last tenant didn't clean at all so they have to fix pretty much everything before we move in but other then that it's a nice apartment, but do you think from what i said it's worth $775 a month in Shippensburg,PA?

My husband and I are just a few points on our credit report away from getting a house that his Grandfather built and was sold a few years ago outside of the family and now is a foreclosure. We have to move fast so we heard about piggybacking and his mother is adding him as an authorized user on her credit card with a very long history and excellent payments. (her score is 800+)       My Question is if anyone has tried this and how many points did your score raise?       Just for an FYI we have NO late payments on our credit report. We are just building our credit and it is just taking too long. So if you don't have nothing nice to say don't say anything at all. Also I have seen a lot of comments about piggybacking not working anymore because they put a stop to it. Not true. FICO tried, but it was turned down in court because it is NOT illegal. As long as it isn't abused, It's a good thing:)

Now that he has graduated college with a business degree, he wants to find himself a "real" career he says. He just says that there isn't a lot of upward mobility in the company and that most of the jobs there they'll hire anyone off the street. Basically he says that over all it's best to work for the actual company and not the subsidiary owned by it. Is this true?

Myself, my fiance, our child and her two children.      I work and make just a little under the income limit which would qualify us for the programs, however, my girlfriend does not work and is a full time student. She gets SSI for her disability and a very small amount in child support.       If we add up our incomes, we do not qualify for the assistance programs, but I was told that you do not need to tell anyone about the income if it is not reportable.      "IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR PARTICIPATION IN THE MORTGAGE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM, THE COMBINED INCOME OF THE BORROWER AND ALL OTHER INCOME PROVIDERS WHO WILL BE LIVING IN THE RESIDENCE BEING FINANCE, CANNOT EXCEED 100% OF THE AREA MEDIAN INCOME."   Taken from:    http://www.barstowca.org/Uploads/Housing...       What would happen if I get the assistance without disclosing her income?      Serious answers only!

Most are arguing that the unions are destroying the profits of the car companies and causing them to near bankruptcy. There is little to no discussion of health care costs associated with workers that are into the thousands of dollars per car. How much does this have to do with problems of the car companies?      Please answer intelligently, not with glib "political" answers.

20090128150806AASQ5ZS	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Should I get out of the military and pursue an accounting career?	My initial military obligation will be ending in a little over a year.  I will be finished with my bachelors in accounting in about three months, and plan to start on my Masters of Accouting degree right away this summer.  I plan on sitting for the CPA exam about this time next year.  I have never intended staying in the military, but with the economy the way it is, I don't know if it would be the best choice for me and my family to get out right now.  I honestly don't care much for what I do, have absolutely no job satisfaction and just feel incredibly constrained by the military.  However, the health benefits are good and it's a steady paycheck.  Even though it's still a little over a year away, does anyone know what the accounting career field is like in this economy?  Should I stay in or would it be worth it to pursue CPA?  Any advice would be great, especially from someone who is currently an accountant or CPA.   Thank you in advance.

20090128144049AAo2Ef8	Business & Finance;Corporations	Moving during a recession?	Is it foolish to leave a steady job behind during a recession?  My husband and I are unhappy with our current city/state and want to be closer to our family.  We are hoping to find new jobs in another city/state and move this summer.  However, I am begining to think that is risky considering the economy.  We have already decided not to go if we don't find jobs.  My husband is worrying about getting laid off from his new job if the economy gets worse since he'll be the newest employee.  I hate my current job and city so staying another year will be awful. Should we stay another year and hope the economy turns around? or Move once we both found jobs and hope neither of us get laid-off?
20090128111921AAfVVPr	Business & Finance;Taxes;United States	Tax rebate question!!!!?	Okay, so heres the deal. I am 16yrs old and I have a twin sister who is 16 as well. We live with my mom and my dad lives in another state. When the tax rebate last year was introduced, my mom got money for her and money for my sister and I. (because we are her dependants.) At this time, my sister and I werent working so we didnt meet the requirements. Now, they just announced that there will be a rebate for people who didnt make the requirements last year. So does that mean that my sister and I would make the requ. b/c we are now working and make an income and have to pay taxes? We are independent now right? So how much money would we get? 300 or $500? Do we put this money on our tax returns? Thanks for the answers...

Amid all this financial melt-down, there is something that I can't understand: the UK economy (like many Western economies) has been growing every year at 2-4% (more or less for the last 16-18 years). So, it must have more or less doubled in that time, in terms of GDP.  So, why is it so disastrous that the IMF is now saying that it will contract by 2.9%? Surely, that would take the economy back to, say, 2006 levels, wouldn't it? How does that make things so bad...  I am confused (and obviously under-educated in this area!).
