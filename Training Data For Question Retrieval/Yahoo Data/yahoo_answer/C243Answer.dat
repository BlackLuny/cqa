Suddenly, the pilot came running back to the passengers and announced that lightning had hit the plane, and they were going to crash in a matter of minutes. There are only enough parachutes for four of the five of us, he announced. Since Im the pilot, I get one! After saying this, the pilot grabbed a parachute and jumped out of the plane.    Im the worlds greatest athlete, proclaimed Michael Jordon. This world needs great athletes, so I must live. Michael Jordon then grabbed a parachute and leaped out of the plane.    Im the smartest man in the world, bragged Bill Gates. The world needs smart men, so I must also live! Bill Gates grabbed a parachute and jumped out of the plane.    At this point, the Pope began to speak. I have lived a long life compared to you, and you may take the last parachute. I will go down with the plane.    You dont have to stay here! replied the pizza delivery man, The worlds smartest man jumped out of the plane with my backpack.    :D      and I know the answer, its: Anyone can chop beef, but no one can PEE soup!  haha :P|`|Lnw6ZYMoaa	Honestly I don't think jokes are funny.

OPNReaAaaa	Yes..actually last night i was dreaming about something weird that i dont remember and when i opened my eyes i THOUGHT i say a little girl standing next to my bed..but i dont think i was awake when i seen it. i got up and went in my moms room at 4 in the morning lol and then i went back to bed but its been freaking me out all day|`|adQI13sjaa	in my dream i met joe jonas. scariest thing of my life. i tried running away from him but his brothers forced me to marry him.    scariest dream of my life.|`|cys7CRh9aa	Yes that has happened to me. And all day long I dread the thought of going to sleep because another bad dream might happen again.|`|OpHex5QKaa	that's terrible man. i've had trouble sleeping after watching enough horror movies, and i've had nightmares that messed me up for a few hours (because of those movies). but i've never really had anything that bad. that sucks.|`|3Nrb2CBXaa	yeah whenever i have a dream about someone close to me dying|`|HivQdKgwaa	I've had a dream that my husband was cheating on me and I woke up and was pissed off with him for the whole day and couldn't look at him cos I was disgusted with him . lol so I wasn't shaken for a day , more angry . It always goes back to normal the next day though lol|`|LsLMGQhjaa	Yes, I Tend To Have Really Graphic Nightmares Sometimes, They Often Get So Bad I Wake Up Crying.|`|KpEayiqcaa	i saw miley cyrus *shakes*|`|6PNuFgTJaa	Have you ever watched an alien movie? I pictured myself in place of an alien trapped in the US government. They keep probbing me, trying to ask me questions, and asking about an attack. My spaceship crashed in New York and they thought I was aiming for the Pentagon. It was terrible because I couldn't contact my family, they kept taking my blood, and even tried to dissect me! Weird right?|`|7pgHntqjaa	i am forever scared of david cook. lol it sounds weird.. but it was a really scary dream, he was like telling me i was going to hell & really creeping me out, nd he had this black bored with beads on it and someone hanging from it and supposedly it was supposed to be me :-/|`|IiDb8DoMaa	oh god yes. I will never forget this dream i had when i was 8. I was going to school, and my friend told me that the school just built a giant playset in the back, and we are free to go there whenever we want, even during classes! So I went down there, and there was this fat kid standing that the top yelling to everyone that nobody better get on the playset or he would throw us across the entire school. We all ran away and I went home. When I got there, I went up to my sister and asked "am i dreaming?" (I had a strange erge to ask that). She didnt answer for a while, and I just stood there waiting. She finally turned around, and her face looked just like the fat kid. She threw me all the way back to the school and i landed on the playset. When I hit the ground, the fat kid stepped right in front of me and said "I told you to stay away!" Then suddenly i saw dark evil tenticles with eyes coming from behind him, then suddenly I was in a weird world that looked alot like the backround when you fight giygas in earthbound. (if you dont know what that is, look it up on google.) Then suddenly i saw a textbox appear that said I....m    H....a....p....p....y.... Then I saw basically every person i know on this planet with the same tenticals the fat kid had. They all jumped at me with vicious fangs and red eyes I screamed my head off, then i woke up. Holy crap that dream still haunts me to this day|`|AA12278670	I had a tarot reading done by my bestfriend years ago and pushed past the Wheel of Fortune card to try to get more out of the reading..apparently that was the wrong thing to do because supernatural things started happening in my apt., I went to spend the night at my boyfriend's but couldn't sleep because I kept having visions of sharp-toothed skeletal beings massacring innocents, in bloody violent images...every time I closed my eyes the image would be in front of me. Then it turned into a black-hooded reaper type figure with long pointed sharp teeth and claw-like fingers reaching for me... It was awful! I didn't sleep the whole night and was badly shaken for days because I was afraid to go to sleep lest I see that again... When I told her about it, she said yeah that sometimes happens, at least you didn't wake to find him standing over your bed...|`|stFMk5khaa	Being raped and brutally assaulted then buried alive in the front lawn of my parents house...it was one of those vivid dreams where you could feel everything upon waking...my body was so sore...|`|2MlJ5OdYaa	Absolutely, I have dreams that rattle my cage all of the time.|`|lE5k5RFgaa	Yeah, it has actually. My dreams are very graphic and when I have a real nightmare it can keep me feeling blah for a week.|`|QcsbthVIaa	omg i had a dream that wolves were chasing me and then i turned into one and started killing all my family&&friends.i was creeped 4 like a week. yes its normal|`|91b27b540655ebe4e66c72274b49dd33aa	yes it has|`|XB5UCW0Raa	Oh yes then im scared to sleep in the dark|`|SYDaRM11aa	yea|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well yes but the nightmares that I have had(wouldn't call them nightmares) scared me beyond anything that will ever scare me in real life,go to my 360 page blog and read all about it.|`|hNa5oHxQaa	Not really.  But I have had one that left me shaken all morning.|`|BulOiEr3aa	yeah.the other day i had a dream that i was dead and i was already buried and stuff. it's still freaking me out|`|3EyK4x2Naa	Yeah, when I have dreams about violence or death.|`|Zg0n5nOGaa	A reenactment Emily Rose/The Exorcist; jeez. I couldn't sleep for another day.|`|XXf4JHd5aa	Sadly yes...everything seems just off for about a day, but then its okay the next day|`|Jvv7v52Jaa	yes, i had a dream i saw my self in the mirrow behind myself and i couldt take a shower for a while|`|auwG3d2yaa	When I was a kid, I used to have a lot of nightmares about demons and the apocalypse. Those nightmares in some way use to control my life, and I used to live with constant fear. It's very rare that I have nightmares now, but when I do, I think about them profoundly for days.|`|S3tK5UN3aa	UGHHHH yes I hate when that happens  I've had so many scary dreams about... Things... And all of next day I'm paranoid.|`|f0c9b33b60bdc539994e570195e86071aa	Yes. I had a dream where i was in a pit of black rock and it had frozen blood at the bottom i was standing in the center and all of a sudden these random zombies walked out that had gray skin.They enclose me in a circle then right before they grabbed me then was a BOOM. the frozen blood cracked and right before i fell in i woke up.|`|ehmeG65gaa	yes, a million times!  I was Nocturnal for a year, over nightmares!  In my most recent one, eveything is black and white (my dreams are usually in color) and I stop at this gas station in the middle of nowhere. there is no one there, and after i wonder around a while i see someone comming near me. It's a girl in a very dirty white dress, she is sooooo thin, I can see her ribs through the dress, her arms are like noodles. She runs up to me, Pins me down, and bites hard into my forearm, it hurts and there is blood running everywhere. The scary part is, this thin, half dead, possibly a zombie, girl looks up at me and i realize...  that she is me.  all the sudden my perspective changes and i'm the zombie girl, horrified at what i'm doing, but my stomach is rolling in pain.      I ended my diet the next day, lest I begin eating human flesh.|`|Y4UF3kWxaa	PU$$Y|`|rfvRcOl9aa	YEAH I'V had them before|`|RIZpDdNgaa	Yes!

I was scared, and I did it a year go, when I was 11 and my mom was with me and she started screaming and I started crying and that was a trauma. But here is a funny story:  I was about to play a game similar to Scary Maze a couple of months ago and it was called "Hypnosis Seance" and I had no clue how did it finish and I knew that was gonna be scary and so I took some pillows, my teddy bear and hide under the bed while the hypnosis seance was being played and my BFF came in my room and I looked like a freak hiding under the bed, starring at the computer and there was nothing but some squares and circles, when my BFF was laughing with me and watching he computer a big red eye came out and she screamed and went downstairs!!!   Anyways, Scary Maze had no warning and it was SCARY!!! The girl from that movie, right? It was bloody scary

Big booby's trapped.  LOL.|`|U311MeRNaa	bit concerned about the person who wrote "boobie is more aesthetically pleasing" especially for a girl    the term "booby trap" (correct spelling) refers to a trap set for a fool, or "booby", the meaning of the word has changed and the devices used by miliatary to set them updated greatly.    but the origional concept was the one we are all familiar with... a hole in the ground with sticks over the top, only a fool would walk over it... hence the name

Z5mmaFK0aa	STONE!! sorry I am late I was answering another Q    Oroborus - Gojira    Its about Spirituality in a positive way. From the point of view of the writer he talks about since he was a child he has always know that his inner Goodness his Inner light is going to be Forever, like an Instinct he knows he is here for a reason. To live, learn and then move on to another existence in another dimension. That what looks like pending doom and the end of life known as Death is only just an illusion that this short spurt and space of time he will only leave and then move on.    That's it in a nut shell I love the lyrics the are very intellectual and technical with an awesome vocabulary choice. not to bad for what manymain-streamerss call a bunch of stupid metal stoner guys    here are the lyrics if you want to read    Serpent of light, movement of the soul  Crawling stately along the spine  Mighty phoenix, from the ashes arises  Firebird cycle, life, regenerate the cell    Life burns fierce, reduced to ashes  Resurrection from the flame, ageless process  Quest for absolution, out of bounds introspect  Self-consuming womb, ever-present, meet no end    It seems like I always knew this  Since I'm a child I can feel it  My inner light everlasting  Revolving within a circle    Extended wings I'm flying  Over the valleys and planes  The curve of space I'm leaving  Death is just an illusion    Oroborus symbol of eternal life  Dig a tunnel through light, through ignorant walls  I'm counting the days but I'm dying  Grow up with impatience I'm falling down    On the peaks of radiant mountains  This truth is growing before before me  My attention fixed on this silence  Rediscover life while I'm breathing    Designing the shape of material  Frozen icon distant reminder  Mankind has forgotten the gateways  By the mouth of the serpent regenerate|`|YlCgMDVwaa	It's about how the concept of fashion, wealth, material items, and selfish desires are ruining society.

Clear this room from your lungs    Pull yourself together  Pull yourself together, man  Pull yourself together  Pull yourself together  On your back    (You're sleeping in a bed of shame)  Let the light breathe some  New life into this room  It's what keeps you coming back    (Made up of insatiable taste)  Bury your head in your hands  Then sing it to yourself, oh    Just what are you so afraid of?  What are you so afraid of?  You're staring truth in the face  So, come on down  What are you so afraid of?    (You're busy living now, aren't you? No  You're busy making vows  You're coming unglued)    Time is shorter than you know  I know the light is blinding to the naked eye  So, why don't you (take steps away from being alone?)  I swear, it's not too late for you    It's all worth reaching for  It's all worth reaching for  It's all worth reaching for  The hands will pull you out    It's all worth reaching for  The hands will pull you out    Wake up, wake up, wake up  And step outside your box  Wake up, wake up|`|HGnWKRzyaa	Subdivisions - Rush     I think that it is about the pressures and challenges that teens face growing up.

It's  comforting.|`|ONWCXzUMaa	As Tears Go Bye    It is the evening of the day  I sit and watch the children play  Smiling faces I can see  But not for me  I sit and watch  As tears go by    My riches can't buy everything  I want to hear the children sing  All I hear is the sound  Of rain falling on the ground  I sit and watch as tears go by    It is the evening of the day  I sit and watch the children play  Doing things I used to do  They think are new  I sit and watch as tears go by    You I don't really know cause I was young myself when this song came out and I fell in love with it, today it makes more sense to me, as I'm older, I feel what the song sings about is how I sit and which the children, I know now whats in the song is what I see now. What children are going now is no different than I when I was there age.  take care   dave  the song is by the Rolling Stones|`|vlIXsFmhaa	Metallica- Fade to Black   its about suicide|`|wXv50mNEaa	Little known fact: "Heroin" by The VU is actually just a retelling of the plot of Bambi.     Actually, I'd say Pharaoh Sanders's "The Creator Has a Master Plan" is my favorite song. What's it about? Well, I can post the lyrics here.

Persuing design both far and wide.  Now that you know there's time,  Rethink everything heard by the careless chior.    The way we see these thingsit's how we dream about reality.   Promblematic to believe, let alone percieve.   With doubt your mind reads through internally, while observation flees.   Nothing can turn the sun back around.    Persuing design and out of time.  Now that you know there's time,   Rethink everything heard by the careless chior.    Sit and watch as I arise.   I lean on surmise, though thier eyes are far from dry.   Will fingers uncross?

AA10053661	I say we start with an intervention. Seriously..... sit down and be Frank with yourself. Why not? You're already schizo so one more personality shouldn't matter.     If that doesn't help, try a trial separation. Just don't lose your head over this matter! It's not worth it.    If you're still convinced you need a divorce, put your kids before yourself.(ves) How will they turn out as a result of all this? You know you don't want them to feel like they have to divide their love. As my Aunt Sybil always said, "If you can keep yourself together, your kids will turn out ok."

RKMWeMk9aa	Sell them to Kid Rock since he can't write his own music.|`|wXv50mNEaa	You don't sell songs directly to bands. If you wrote a song (a whole song, not just lyrics), you might be able to sell it to a record company, but that's incredibly unlikely, especially if you're young. You'd be better off forming a partnership with a band, and getting royalties if that song sells. Still, most bands can write their own material.

Zx0V8d5Vaa	cause they come in gangs watch out    and give me best answer pleasssssssse :'(|`|X7nkrw6maa	They should run on time but if they don't there are a number of reasons why.  They have either broken down or held up in traffic are the 2 main ones.  As for coming in bunches of 2,3,or 4 this is due to the traffic and lots of passengers which causes some of them to run late, thus meaning that the same number of bus catches up with the one in front.  This usually only happens in rush hour though.  Every company wants their buses to run on time so there is always a reason.|`|xKaDSEXRaa	It really depends where you are. In the UK buses were deregulated in 1986 and as such are run by private companies. Like all companies, their aim is to make a profit or they go bust. Therefore routes are run on frequencies that make commercial sense. A    Additionally it makes sense to schedule buses to make them most worthwhile. i.e a route might take 25 minutes to do a return trip. In an hour a bus could do two trips on a half hourly frequency with a 5 minute gap to "catch up" if there are delays. By making the frequency every 20 minutes would require two vehicles as the first bus would not be back in time to start the next trip. This additional vehicle might add too much of a cost than the likely increase in revenue so the frequency would be set at 30 mins.    With regard to why buses "run in threes" there are two reasons. On a 10 minute services, the buses may start off 10 minutes apart. The first one gets delayed by a parked car, passenger who doesn't have pass or money ready, a red traffic light. This delays the bus by 4 mins. Bus two does not have these problems so starts to gain on bus one. Over a long route buses soon start to bunch up.    The other reason is that the stop where you are waiting might be a busy stop with buses coming from and going to different places. Whilst there might be three buses, they may not all being going to your destination.|`|MFZUlj3haa	'coz I drive faster than the rest of the drivers :)|`|PaShCpyOaa	I actually read about it in a maths book.    With reasons like picking up people, the routes, traffic lights and the speed of traffic, it gives time for buses far apart to catch up to each other. According to statistics, probability and all that, they are likely to arrive in groups of three.|`|4aveC2aaaa	because.....*thinks*      ............thats how life is|`|twVyisGnaa	It's a weird schedule that they have.  And yeah, it sucks when they don't arrive at their usual times.  Sometimes, I wish some of my buses arrived early.    VIVA LA RAZA!|`|DEcunDd5aa	I've wondered that too, but have never got the nerve to ask the bus driver why there are 2 other buses coming up behind him.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	mo' fo sho  lol    it's a conspiracy!    i'm kidding...listen to the bus driver i guess  hehe  :)|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	Because they don't want you to feel you don't have a choice!......LOL!

FtBqmFDEaa	I know, 2 inches of snow where I live in Ireland. Last week I walked my 3 dogs up on the bog, there was snow on the ground and the cold wind gave me a headache and my ears weren't covered by my scarf, I couldn't feel them or my feet or my fingers for ages after I came back.    Whose dumb idea was that?  No such foolhardiness today, I'm staying in the house, had a nice fry up for breakfast, the log fire is lit and the dogs can go run round the garden if they want :)|`|ffe5fd93595474e278dc16274aa2a2d4aa	Its around -2 according to the BBC but am inside by a radiator so don't know what its really like.    I wear a hat and then my hood, my ears have been fine. If I hadn't been wearing a hat then yes, they would be cold.    Try covering your ears, lips and under your nose with vaseline, it can help protect them a little from the cold.

The snow actually keeps the air warmer because the sun light  reflects off the snow etc etc. For a whole month here it was between -20 and -30 degrees below zero Fahrenheit,  WITHOUT the wind chill. So that's like -60 Celsius.  The snow in London is only a big deal because it does nothing but rain there.|`|e6e1b317c7e9449076112be19c76481baa	Well I'm in London, and I think everyone is making a mountain out of a mole hill.

I2Gsu4tMaa	Of course we would. It would definitely show confidence as long as he wasn't cocky or a jerk about it.    Um, yeah it would matter what he was talking about it. I wouldn't like it much if he started talking to me about something weird.|`|k3Gzg3Kaaa	hell yeah :]]|`|f5oZRD6faa	Yeah that would be great but i probably would'nt act like it beacause id be shy=)|`|SoFeInwKaa	Hell Yeah!|`|mMi19s7Vaa	happens to me many of times    so i don't mind     i love to talk to new people and a hot guy at that that's a bonus lol =]|`|ZyjqjNn5aa	I would like it. But, it would be kind of awkward!  It shows that he has confidence by walking up to a stranger  and starts to talk.  And..it would matter about the subject. Because if it was something that is really uncomfortable to talk about then, I would probably look at him weird and walk away.|`|WoDh8hD2aa	obviously i would love this...    it does show he is confident and as long as he is respecting me, i dont care what he would be talking about =)|`|nuLroEjraa	i think the obvious answer would be yes.    if he said something stupid, i wouldn't care because i know what it's like to be super nervous.|`|INf502UUaa	I guess? It depends if he's nice or not and is not full of himself.|`|DjbCw7ePaa	Oh, sure.  As long as he's not talking about my boobs.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	As long as he has $$$|`|am5nCCDuaa	sure|`|POaW7AKUaa	It would be nice.  I'd rather it be the guy I like.|`|uGhBrm7caa	Yes for the confidence...totally cool.    Yes for the IT MATTERS what he is talking about!    For example...if he came up to me talking about his ingrown toenails or armpit hair...Uhhhh, YEAH! It matters!!! lol|`|yoTrec6Aaa	Duhhh! He's a hott/cutee guy i'll act like it was akward but i'll love it ;DDD|`|f7Rf3JiHaa	Haha, I wouldn't care probably because I love talking and meeting new people.|`|wnkj0b41aa	Yeah I wouldn't mind that :)    And yeah it kinda does matter what he's talking about. I mean I wouldn't want him to be talking about like something completely rude or stupid ya know?|`|h3Tbhvgoaa	It depends. Looks aren't everything.  He has to be interesting.|`|gDEFlWnOaa	If I was single, yes, it would deinfately be a god thing if he starts a conversation with me!    It does matter what he's talking about in a way- if he's dissing other people, I don't want to hear it you know? As long as it's just neutral or positive.|`|StXmmAeFaa	yes  yes  and yes, he has to talk about something interesting or funny or random|`|Xxn7DssEaa	yeah|`|H2TvQ80Aaa	if hes hot it doesnt matter whats coming out of his mouth|`|h00bqU7baa	No, because I already have a boyfriend.|`|zpiXFpHzaa	definitely  but he better sound smart|`|EPWqhhJSaa	sure, as long as he isn't a jerk or completely into himself|`|MHzNI9Yvaa	duh... of course girls are going to like that..    and yeah it shows confidence...    yeah it somewhat matters what he's talking about cuz i like to have conversations.. so i don't want him to talk about something that i have no clue in...  :]|`|nSJ6q5SQaa	I would, at first, wonder why he was talking to me and what his intentions were, but if he was nice and joked around a little, it would be fun.   I wouldn't like it if he talked about stuff like football, because I don't know much about that, but if he talked about basketball, or, if you see the girl you want to talk to doing a different sport, talk to her about that. Or, if she is in your class, maybe talk to her about the homework in that class. If you still go to school, I mean.  If he said something stupid, I wouldn't care how hott he was, I wouldn't like it.|`|TYgQHhThaa	yes cause if they come up and say something dumb and they are actin lik a jerk then you would not want 2 talk 2 him|`|nXUV9lH1aa	haha! i would love it if that happened. i would think he was totally confident that he just randomly walked up to me.     i wonder if guys think the same if a random girl were to walk up to them.|`|XWvsbK8saa	yes (although a cute/hot girl would be okay too)    yes    sorta|`|MHPyshrCaa	if a guy walked up to me and i didn't know him then i would think he is weird ! but if he seems nice then i would give him the time of he day to talk to him.but i would still think it's weird.|`|3zSYBeTFaa	What do you mean by random?  I talk to people in the grocery store, elevators, halls.  Unless it's some kind of line or creepy.  It's fine.  You have to meet people some way.

If you said you favor abortion, a troll who dislikes people who favor abortion, will look for other questions or answers of yours and will cause you to get a violation for silly stuff like :"chatting", because they did not like your answer that you favored abortion.

2rJwgk40aa	As far as I know,hes not married.|`|AA11311675	Jensen is not married and is not dating someone named Stephanie Ware. This all started because some crazy fan came on imdb.com and stared spreading rumors that she was his step-daughter and then she was banned. She later came back on impersonating the REAL Stephanie and saying that she was married to him. If you dont believe me you can log onto imdb.com look up Jensens page and read threads that deal with him being married. This is a rumor and nothing more. I know some of his friends and they can vouch that he isnt married.
67GoFqKDaa	Nope|`|AA11370204	Absolutely Not!|`|sJ0sLvaPaa	A can of orange spray paint works just as good, and is much cheaper...|`|39SPqvhyaa	not at all, lots of men tan. especially those who work out and want to look their best besides, women love to see the the guys in the salons.

He chose the meth.    Thank God.  We're so free now.|`|3533878a4dd2e1fbf5bf9526167668dbaa	Yes, only because I didn't give them what they wanted. Some guys are very immature, especially in high school. Ignore them.|`|pYe3kkgNaa	yes i have and no you're not the only one|`|BCgp7GTpaa	no you are so not alone.  Guys are jerks!  They trick is to find the one who would never even think those words about you!|`|wnkj0b41aa	I don't think so. But girls have called me those though a few times before :\|`|QR9Zbs2Eaa	You are way to young to be dealing with that! I hope you told him to get lost.     And yes when I was in high school I started dating a guy that was really mean. At first it was verbal like what you experienced and later in the relationship it progressed to physical abuse...best to stay away from guys like that! TRUST ME. :)|`|cxVmq2kraa	Haha yeah.      He called me a "punk a*s b*tch."    Freshman was the year as well.

''I am a dishonest liar.''    Sash.|`|vqSkOICGaa	I hate liars so no I don't lie often. but I do tell little white lies or 'leave out the truth' so they say...but never about anything crucial. the truth is always best.|`|U2pDv67qaa	no, never - would you like a girlie night out?|`|cOTcJ45waa	nope     and gess what im floating in mid air   Nope not a lie|`|u9uFdSrqaa	all the time I barely even notice anymore|`|KlkUj6uFaa	Often enough.|`|en628a4haa	Everything I say is a lie.|`|ZDOfXBd2aa	Never.    Or am I lying?|`|hKVh1EIcaa	yes i lie down often|`|WTf21t9Jaa	In a day, I'd say I lie about 5 times, maybe. I try not to.  They're only little lies, though.

daij1eBCaa	I think Casey did it too. She's young and she wanted her life back and Caylee was just weighing her down with "motherly duties". It's horrible, I mean she could've just left her with her parents because they loved her so much! They would've kept her as their own. It's a shame that there are people out there like Casey Anthony.    R.I.P Caylee ?|`|grifjdr0aa	Casey because she is a self-centered sociopath.|`|LRLu1ofNaa	Casey Anthony. Isn't it obvious?|`|O0VQqIkDaa	Casey did, cause she was tired of the responsibility of being a mom and she wanted to get back at her own mom.|`|3TQCwtxJaa	I think Casey did and if for no other reason, to spite her parents for loving that little girl more than they loved her.  Tragic ending for such a beautiful little baby.
vqSkOICGaa	nope, cell phone only. i have unlimited minutes anyway so it works perfectly:)|`|q9BItD25aa	I have a landline only ( with long distance, internet access, voice mail)  No cell phone as all my money goes to my tuition|`|jndrzC7laa	lol. no.|`|QCpKkRvSaa	a wha?|`|m1JyB08Raa	yup landline/dsl service/cellphone.|`|stFMk5khaa	Landline and Cell|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Landline only-have no interest in speaking to people on the phone when I'm out-not even fond of answering the phone at home.
d6u5ovQAaa	DESPITE THAT I'M MODERATE,I HONESTLY ADMIT THAT YES IT IS A NORMAL,DAILY THING FOR ME,BUT IT ALWAYS FLATTERS ME,EVEN AT THE TIMES OF THAT WHICH ANNOYS ME MOST! I THANK MY LUCKY STARS,HEAVEN,&THE BIG MAN UPSTAIRS FOR EVERYTIME IT HAPPENS& I APPRECIATE HOW BLESSED I AM.|`|3mHQQeLNaa	flattery because it make u feel pretty ... unless the guy is like staring at u and is realy ugly haha ... but if the guy is cute then most girls wont mind and me if the guy i ugly i don't like act rude about it i just let him glance... so yes girls find it flattery|`|G1fDp1PEaa	They like it, some just wont admit it.    EDIT: Unless you are a total creep that wont stop staring.|`|QEqGukjZaa	it just looking...it more of a compliment if a man looks at a girl like that..    just stop staring tho...    but if i look up and down, and sometimes right and left..front and back too.    just dont be about lust..just look cuz she is beautiful..and she got nice curves.=)...    or maybe she got a toilet paper stuck on her shoe..    either way..imma look until im blind..|`|hnwMC1XQaa	Typically, a little bit of both.|`|M7W7lZBBaa	a mix of flattery and something else|`|ZkJ3CvXpaa	both    if they do it 4 like a lil while its ok  but if dey keep on doing it i get freaked out & b like damn dis guy needs 2 get laid or something like dat
AB1xk3OBaa	Yes i love that song even though i don't like most of her music and i love Lil Waynes part even thought i don't like a lot of his music.  Its an awesome song|`|MwOMTHkKaa	Yes, its a good song and Lil Wayne deffinately helps the song out, lol
G33E41IBaa	WOMEN.  Gosh, some women don't flush and they can leave things in the toilet than men don't.  And surprisingly, they miss.  There's also hair around the sink too.  You'd think women would be cleaner, but I guess in restrooms where you remain anonymous they don't care.  In house bathrooms, women are VERY clean though.    And at least urinals have little drains in them.  I don't know what a men's restroom is like, but judging how bad women's restrooms are like I think they take the award for nastiest public bathroom.|`|m1JyB08Raa	men because we pee on the floor.|`|2PFn8k4jaa	men cause they're allowed to pee against that thing in the wall LoL|`|5jqfKDdfaa	Both are gross, but i can say women and their periods are the NASTIEST things on the planet!!!|`|yC5wufu9aa	Men. Because we don't care who goes in after us so we just leave it all gross. Sometimes I wanted to use a girls restroom just because the guys restroom was so damn nasty.|`|7nTJKhW6aa	men! they r gross|`|gHWu7MZYaa	Men because when we use a urinal it splashes.|`|OkCrlU7Aaa	I used both men and women restroom haha and I gotta say girls for suree! There's always at least 4 toilets out of 5 that isn't flushed filled with toilet paper or diareahh, blood on the floor, and one time someone wiped their poop and I guess missed the toilet somehow and left it on the floor. And omg, the seats! They always put pee on the seats!|`|QEqGukjZaa	lol    believe it or not..women are..you be surprised    men are suppose to be nasty..lol were men..    but women..wow..|`|Ov83HJEFaa	Men, because they pee when they stand up and you never know...they may have missed...|`|c0p2BYwnaa	surprisingly, i think women do. some women have left the nastiest messes ive ever seen (trust me, you don't want to know) and i have been forced to use the men's bathroom on several occasions. so much cleaner.|`|am5nCCDuaa	idk I've never been in the men's restroom|`|xwEEfzY7aa	Women have all of their makeup and hair stuff all over the place...............
Lj2mo4ooaa	Just bought one tonight for my husband.  He's scared to death, but  . . . a little excited.  We talked about it ahead of time, so it's not like it was a surprise.    It's a very personal gift, so . . . if you two are really close, then . . .|`|SBVGQ5S1aa	I think it'd be a great gift!|`|KuNM2j9caa	If he doesn't want it, I'll take it!  Damn, I could go for a good massage!
TmHdtgZCaa	Haha, Ive done some of those too!!    Mine would be:    One time I was in Hobby Lobby, and my friend and I were goofing off. I ran to jump on her back, and my pants ripped all down my butt, and continued down to my thigh!! O.o It was horrible, because neither of us had a jacket, and my mom made us go into Walmart after wards!! Lets just say I ran straight to the skirts....    Today, actually, my neighbor (who is a guy) came over to get help on his homework--we are in the same classes, so we have the same work.  Anyway, he came over and went to my room to wait until I cam back with my text book, and when I walked into the room he was just standing there, open mouthed. He was pointing to something, so when I looked, I noticed my frilliest thong laying on top of a pile of clean clothes!! D: It was horrible!!    And one time I threw up at my friend's birthday party!! :D Haha, we were 12.    I remember another one!!  This one time I was at the mall with a bunch of my friends, and I saw this realllllllly cute guy. He walked passed me, and I caught a wiff of his cologne, and it smelt really good. So I, being the complete retard that I am, blurted out, "He smells soooooo good!!" And he turned around and just stared at me.  D: I hadn't realized he was still in hearing distance. Oops!!|`|8a1d6ccf0d0d55393c413e0362906d9eaa	accidentally bending over to pick up my pencil that i dropped, and i farted...:[ soooo embarrassing...my face was pure red...gosh im getting red now...i could feel my cheeks burning...ugh...:P ?|`|283JrACKaa	It was my first day of school and I started to have a crush on this guy and was excited when I knew we had gym class 2gether 2 bad I diddnt see the sighn 4 the boys locker room since it was my first day i was clueless of where the buildings are. so i accidentaly went inside the boys locker room and my crush never talked to me eversince we graduated|`|9fZfwfe9aa	So we were in music class and there's this boy in my class who likes me and his friend just screamed to me in front of the whole class that the boy who liked me told him that he thinks I'm hot.Then the music teacher said ahh young love.

As Bette Davis said, "She's slept with everyone at MGM other than Lassie."    Lana Turner...Her teenaged daughter killed her boyfriend after he abused Ms. Turner.     Marilyn Monroe...was sleeping with the President and his brother    Ava Gardner...had notorious fights with hubby Frank Sinatra and slept with loads of men    Grace Kelly...despite her cool, ice blonde image, Kelly slept with  most of the men she made movies with, married or not.     Loretta Young...despite her nun like image and her devotion to Catholicism, I think Ms. Young earns the bad girl of the year award for sleeping with Clark Gable while making a movie, getting pregnant by him and then mysteriously leaving Hollywood for 9 months. Upon returning she is without a baby. A few years later she "adopts" a baby who looks exactly like Clark Gable. And for the young woman's life she never tells her daughter the truth and constantly denies that Clark Gable is her father. Shame! She also never tells her daughter that she is her natural born daughter.

ugzcxnzKaa	Absolutely.  If I had it to do all over again, I'd wait til 30.  Should actually be a law 'cause in your twenties, you're learning which fork to eat with and not to shove your thumb up your a*s.|`|wcp1uvgtaa	Everyone is different.  I have trouble with someone deciding whether people who are legally adult should marry or not. What would be next? An exam? Plenty of people in their 30s and 40s get divorced too. Some people never really grow up.
KxPm8tBgaa	No it's her fault. She's so wet she needs a towel.|`|UjPArJZ6aa	What? Slip out??|`|Qih2hKqkaa	Yes, she makes me stop and go wash it off!|`|hi7uk4Kmaa	Yeah.. she yells & it is not fun. :(|`|JGQmr8bLaa	slip what >:o|`|9xnwKZ3yaa	Depends on how "close" she is.|`|r6oi1HyZaa	yes, all the time; it is a very bad habit|`|lGSUToFQaa	not usually|`|LDSL0DUiaa	Yeah my mom gets angry when i slip on the wet floor :D|`|14gi4aTvaa	I don't think so
n6NJ1e2daa	Eh. Not too far, but they are tasteless. I have always hated those ads. I think they ran one last year, too. I can see how you wouldn't want young kids watching, though.|`|AA11431665	yes it did i don't like those advertisements|`|g2QUNwZzaa	aw he|| no...danica is hot...|`|elPLFotOaa	YES i mean wtf did that have to do with the company.and like you said it is more family-oriented.|`|215646253ac5e0903ab28bc43e031fd3aa	Not far enough.|`|48b7amuZaa	The ad was fine!  Everyone tries so hard to be offended these days!|`|KAkiPY3kaa	You see more skin that that at the beach on any given day.... sheltered people amaze me.|`|OqyZeL9uaa	STEELERS WON WOOO|`|yfi5iB7Zaa	noooo i like it|`|rmek0hhjaa	Totally! I have tried godaddy.com and its not even good. The ad was slightly funny but mostly stupid. It could have been funny, but it wasnt|`|XCjzc6nMaa	idk if it went to far but it was kinda stupid and goofy.|`|AMQe8mYKaa	Idk But A Little To Far If You Ask Me. There Were Kinds Watching It.|`|hE6Z93Ysaa	yes, it was terrible.|`|ZxutJNNIaa	I was watching it with my dad.  He turned to me right after and said "That was a bit much"    It was really funny reaction, from him at least.|`|TMAq2m7Gaa	No. Had they done the tilt down, there would have been another wardrobe malfunction.|`|HJrTuihcaa	yes, i think they did. because little kids are watching the super bowl and the families don't want to see a girls boobs and everything. and i think that commercial gave the website a bad name, i dont know what it really is but i would think it is like either a dating website or for a porn site...|`|vGE53KW8aa	no those girls needed to show more|`|IuM7rz5Daa	yes  i was like wtheck?  what is it? like a porn site?  they had 2 a shower one and the court one where the girl is about to flash her boobs  it was so awkward   both my parents and grandparents were in the room at the time|`|KRcAwLGJaa	yea.......wow.    But still, the steelers won. That's all that matters.    My fav team lost super bowl last year and this year they won.    Theyre my new fav team. =)|`|rGnszJ1Raa	Not really. It was surprising and unexpected - as was the other godaddy commercial - but I don't think it went too far. It went far, absolutely, but I personally don't think it crossed the line.|`|LbovVj41aa	I thought it definitely went a little too far.|`|zABLq7JKaa	yes it went way too far and made me feel uncomfortable watching it but im still glad pittsburgh won even though i wanted cardinals to win but they played wimpy on sunday and really had no chance well the real better team won|`|QP9aVgbtaa	it was tasteless and stupid|`|kZ9TTWZ9aa	Oh My God yes! i mean im still a kid and i watched the superbowl. Way too far.|`|aymBTRlyaa	Yes, I do. Football is geared towards men, but on Superbowl especially there are so many little ones around. Luckily my daughter was in the other room when it came on.    Plus, there was like a Doritos one too and they ripped the girls clothes off or something and that bugged me. Society today is perverted and decrepid.|`|Gt8NoO2waa	Nah. it was funny.|`|oojO4WAraa	Yes, it did.|`|frwlypDWaa	No worse than the others. The Super Bowl isn't family-oriented. That's a myth. The ads are aimed at the people with all the money, not the kids. That's why we had Springsteen instead of Miley Cyrus at halftime (thank God)...|`|2esGKO2Caa	I thought it was dumb but whatever different strokes for different folks|`|V5xHaIAcaa	Only if you have a minimal sense of humor and lack a life.

kNnqjlWiaa	most of the states you have to pay and then fill it up, but in new jersey its against the law to fill your car yourself so the gas station guy does it, so here in jersey we pay the guy after he fills it|`|q9BItD25aa	The gas stations are self service so you have to go pay the man and he turns the pump on. Then you pump your gas. You pay before.  In Oregon I think they still have full service  gas stations where the guy comes out and pumps your gas, then takes the money.|`|grifjdr0aa	No.|`|IizPFrELaa	Pay then fill up here in des moines|`|KxPm8tBgaa	You pay and fill up or you can fill up and pay as you go.|`|JBv7pwrHaa	Well a few places let you pay after, but most of them are pre pay only.|`|POaW7AKUaa	Nope.

4DNDAGbXaa	or really pretend like you are high tech and stick it in a blender|`|AA12205301	I think most people are too lazy to smash the food themselves. I did it for my kids.  It was simple. Just feed them basically the same foods, just smashed. My daughter was sucking crab out of her dads fingers at 3 months. She didn't stay in the smashed food for long, she wanted it like everyone elses, so she was eating small chopped solids about 5 months old. She is 20 months and uses a normal cup. It is not that hard to make your own baby food people!!!! And it tastes better than that bottled crap.|`|grifjdr0aa	Well, I used a little grinder when my kids were babies and the older two each have a 5 y/o and a 2 y/o now and guess what, they are all just fine!    So yeah, they oughta try it!|`|C2sZREuAaa	or nursing homes would be in trouble|`|H9gmJYdmaa	But the secret of Gerber Baby food that the corporations don't tell you is that before it's packaged, they let birds chew it so it's mushy.|`|2PTlXs9zaa	I never bought an ounce of baby food. Had a grinder, and used it. Too damn expensive for that tasteless crud.|`|ipaMI2Woaa	I know right!  :)|`|m1JyB08Raa	thanks for the info,when i have kids ill remember this very good tidbit.|`|Qih2hKqkaa	People are too lazy to do that!|`|laLW1Krwaa	why smash it when its smashed for you|`|bnGnE58zaa	Did you no more bugs are found in baby food than normal food.

No big deal really.  Sure we looked a little uneven standing side by side and I never really felt "held" by him because I was bigger, but other than than it was fine.  We eventually broke up but it wasn't about how tall he was at all.|`|uvo9ERqbaa	No I wouldn't, he has to be at least the same height, but preferably taller than me.|`|DPmU5gB6aa	no..! Noway!  (and I'm 5ft 9in, so you can imagine how hard this is for me..!)|`|nqlk9iUCaa	Hmm, I know it's mean, but No|`|jGRB7uSMaa	no, well i dont think so|`|m9tWBMBJaa	noooooooooo.|`|AA11687651	no, i prefer taller =]|`|moFyK8s3aa	Hmm I guess so. Although it would be really weird dating someone shorter than 5'3.|`|r8s5j6zOaa	yes I would|`|y92o0hkHaa	well i'm 5'2 so finding someone actually smaller than me would be quite challenging...|`|5jINw4PGaa	No it seems kind of weird.|`|KAkiPY3kaa	Nope, big turnoff. And its impossible since im 6'as it is. My boyfriend now is taller than me at 6'1", lol|`|0d48efb9bb3ec04d1446c03dc1edcde3aa	Uh, I'm only 5'1.. so any shorter and he'd be a midget. Nope, I prefer taller guys.    Cheers =)|`|pdzfq7ojaa	I might be right now  but he completely ignores me so it's not like we ever stand close enough that you would notice.  :(  I'm not even sure who's taller, to be honest.  We're both short.  But yes, I would.|`|PYmpqmmAaa	No, personally I wouldn't    But, both my sister-in-laws are taller then my brothers (their husbands)|`|Q6x1gSlKaa	considering im 5 feet tall, probably not, unless i wanted to go to jail|`|kzoUGdg0aa	Nope..It's not hard to be taller than me...I'm only 5"1.|`|dDR4RGrbaa	No. That would just be awkward.|`|7MsozqOdaa	i dont really care how tall they are..|`|5b3af9a49c0e12c4785f7079ccfaab7baa	No!|`|ZxutJNNIaa	No.|`|A15bfvkBaa	I guess not.|`|PakkKi2vaa	I am. Its not a huge height difference. I'm an inch taller than him. But I'm taller than most people (I'm 5'11" - he's 5'10")
U0KCmsKXaa	Most definitely.  I just don't get along with men my own age for some reason.|`|6ccd4882dc74fe3bac069fc84fb4af63aa	If I were an adult, maybe.  Now, no, because that would be both illegal and creepy.|`|fEfNcumxaa	Yes if i was micheal jackson|`|fcba5faee6335c2d386bba63f1fdfd1faa	yes|`|IFs6MWDJaa	Lets see...that would make him 30.....No i dont think so.  I would feel like a child    The youngest i well date is 19 and the oldest i well date is 23  And every year i get older, Both those numbers go up one as well|`|aKfeVaXkaa	If they are hot...but I'm 15...ooh a 25 year old woman...yummy|`|4EflpUK8aa	Yeah, I did when I was 18. It didn't work out very well, but I'd probably try it again if the right person came along.|`|0VYym4gfaa	Being only 16, not right now, but when I'm of age... sure. I'm actually more attracted to guys about 10 years older than me than I am to guys my own age.|`|9tGHTMUhaa	I don't think that I honestly would. If I did then he would be in his mid-forties and that is a little too old for me. My man is a year older than me and that suits me just fine :-)|`|B2duikyaaa	yes if i liked them|`|Lj2mo4ooaa	Yeah, I did.  10 years is not so much when you're adults.  Now, 20 years???  That's a lifetime!|`|zc9ZhoMIaa	I did when i was 23. He was 33. It didnt work but we are still good friends.|`|r8s5j6zOaa	yes and 15 or 20 years older|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Yes I would date someone 10 years older than me, as long as they are nice.|`|ZxutJNNIaa	Not unless I was way old, like 35 or something.|`|C9djEwkfaa	yes i always date older guys. 10 years is nothing.. plus age is just  a number its the person that matters.... i am just not into guys my age...i dont cae about the age i care about the guy and who he is .... my bf is alot older then me and i think  hes great ....
AA12187799	can`t afford it anymore (sob).So little joy in my life!|`|18K7ucsEaa	No, I don't.. I guess I'm just not that desperate :-D    BTW, I was wondering... I live in Texas and here there is a sin tax for going to strip clubs (I'm not sure if it's just before a certain time or what) is that everywhere?|`|rVTSRQVGaa	sadly im 2 young 2 enter|`|YxCRA5N7aa	NO IT IS INAPPROPRIATE HAD GROSS  GIRLS GET NAKED IN FRONT OF PEOPLE FOR MONEY!|`|rllnRDNmaa	no  12
3Iq2FB0kaa	I have 2    Knock knock  whos there  interupting dog  interu.......  woof woof    and:    a blonde a redhead and a brunnette are trapped at an island. 5 mins later a genie comes up and then says they each get one wish. the redhead and the brunnette wish they were home. then the blonde feels lonely and wishes them bak:)
4k5MkmInaa	Yes-i don't mind.    can you give me the link to it?
8D8ck9pVaa	omg i know a girl exactly like that.    sometimes i think 'im a nicer person than her, why do they all revolve around her?'    the girl i know gets all the attention, im not jealous, but i just see a horrible side to her. She can be really self-centred.  all the girls that know her think this, but shes never short of boy company,    i know exactly what you mean!|`|4oBCEkheaa	guys like s l u t s  watcha gonna do|`|Cl92Wvl1aa	sounds like a girl i would NOT like...but she probably has allot of confidence and confidence is really sexy.|`|eiEdUWNbaa	Is her name Scarlett O'Hara?|`|4vvELzRzaa	we girls will never understand boys|`|4EflpUK8aa	The truth? She's probably doin' it with all of them.|`|SWS8QWvhaa	ok this girl is OBVIOUSLY easy  meaning she'll give it up to any guy or prolly even girl  son't even worry abt ppl like her ughh, they disgust me|`|qiVE00ecaa	The sad truth is that looks do account for everything according to some guys.  They are not the most important to me, but all those boys will probably do whatever she says. Thats called being whipped.  Test it out by having the girl ask a boy to get her a candy bar or a pencil or something.  If he does it right away or looks very committed to doing it, then he is very whipped.|`|wNLmGzSwaa	Boys like a girl who will allow them to touch her, feel her up and do the same to them, in return. These girls are commonly called "easy", or worse.   Don't pattern yourself after her. When the boys become men, they'll be looking for the "nice" girls, leaving the tramps on the street.  Be patient, your turn will come.|`|DF22BQ3yaa	Well....|`|CPY2WlEvaa	she probably puts out
XhRLCFz8aa	You could do a blog on the hundreds of amazingly cool new species found in deep water trenches every year.    If you are into cyborgs, you should do a blog on the creation of synthetic dna used to create living hardware and computer components.    If you are an architectural engineer, you should do a blog on the development of artificial landscaping around the planet.    If you have level 9 clearance within the US government, you should do a blog on the telekinesis, remote viewing, and paranormal research happening at undisclosed locations around our country.    Haha. I'm sorry, that's all just craziness. I don't really have a real idea. You could do a blog on street performers in your city.
CWZR9ipFaa	either that or the basketball game.    i liked it though    "u've slepped with so many men, ur starting to look like one. Boom roasted!"|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Disagree. I can't stand that show.|`|vpeZTL9Laa	Yeah I gotta agree that it was pretty funny.  I didn't even think that Dwight starting the fire was the cold opener and because of that the episode gets the award for the best cold opener!  (I don't think it's the funniest).
nCr1N1Byaa	1) Why you you like Metallica and for how long have you listened to them?  Because their music relaxes me when I'm angry or tense. I'm 18 and I started listening to them around 8 years ago    2) What is your favorite song(s)? Why? What is it about this song(s) that influences you?  Master of Puppets, Fade to black... I like the lyrics, and the melody of Fade to black is really great    3) Have you Been to a Metallica Concert? If so which concert(s)?  No, unfortunately, they haven't been in my part of the world in the last few years    4) How many people do you know who(friends, family, coworkers, person you meet on the train) listen to metallica?  Many (mostly male) friends    5) What do you like about Metallica that other bands dont have?  It's just the enormousness of everything that's Metallica.. They've been around for a long time and they have a HUGE following.. They, for some people, represent the spirit of metal, not just another band    6) Besideds the songs in your opinion, what influence does the band/band members have on people, society, yourself?  You look at the band - and you try to be like them in all the positive things that they do... And you learn from their mistakes... They show the world that even rock stars are basically just human - and that they can screw up in a big way too, lol    7) Anything else that you may want to include!!! please feel free to do so!!!!!!!   Good luck with your essay :) I had to write somethign similar a while ago and I chose to write about the band Queen.  I like Metallica... It was the band that got me into metal  Though, in the recent years - I find myself liking them a bit less... Idk :)|`|DbtS5jzEaa	1. I like Metallica cause they started a genre and have amazing talent..goin on bout 12 years now!    2. One - Epic song amazing instrumentation and vocals. It doesn't influence me as such...makes me hate war though more!    3. Nope :(    4. bout 20 or more    5. Raw Talent (back in their early days)    6. Well Lars can manage to screw A LOT of people....I think they have a certain impact on a certain community    7.EPICCCCCC|`|ibDadEHDaa	er.... if you ask me metallica isn't that great of a group to dedicate. before '91 they were a thrash metal band who basically said "screw you" to society" and now they're a bunch of greedy mainstream "musicians" who will do anything to make a quick buck. lol sorry i guess i skipped right to  7|`|OTFzJbaMaa	i adore metallica but this is YOUR essay. if you feel like they should be considered people of this era then you need to write some ideas on why you belive that its not up to us its up to you to prove your teacher wrong.     dont rely on other people to write on a subject that YOU want to do. use your own examples and reasons why you chose them. not other peoples. be creative!|`|Xa3zrFX8aa	1. I like Metallica because their instrumentals are amazing. Kirk Hammett is my main influence and MY IDOL! i ******* love him. Lars is an amzing drummer! Cliff burton was the best metal bassist to have ever walked this earth, R.I.P. James has such a powerful hard hitting voice. I have liked them since i was 6 so 11 years.     2. Harvester of Sorrow, or (Welcome Home) Sanitarium. They both are just soooooooo well written. Harvester of Sorrow is so ******* HEAVY I LOVE IT! and Sanitarium is just catchy and makes me headbang.    3. Yes infact i just saw them in boston almost two weeks ago. I have been to a few concerts over the years, never seen such a wild and awesome crowd.     4. I actually don't know many, probably 10 tops. I don't have an exact number. but around there.    5. OTHER BANDS DONT HAVE KIRK HAMMETT!!!!!!! and other bands dont have the  style of writing that all four of them use. Their new bassist Rob is ok at writing, but what Lars, James, and Kirk write are what really drives the band. So unique.     6. Like i said, my main influence (because Kirk is the reason i took up guitar 8 years ago) is Kirk Hammett. He is god in my eyes, no one will change that.    7. METALLICA IS THE GREATEST HEAVY METAL BAND TO HAVE WALKED THIS EARTH!  R.I..P. Cliff Burton. September 26th, 1986.|`|7InY2vuraa	1) ive been listening to them for 10 years now. i love how they incorporate actual music with powerful guitar riffs and sounds and deep lyrics.    2) my favorite song is fade to black because that song is just pure emotion. it makes me cry like a baby EVERY time i hear it. the way james captures emotion is incredible.    3) Ozzfest 08 in dallas texas.    4) everyone in my family.    5) powerful instrumentals that speak to your heart and soul. solos that make your heart race and wake you up.    6) james hetfield is one of my idols because of his accomplishments and the challenges he's overcome.|`|vlIXsFmhaa	1) Why you you like Metallica and for how long have you listened to them? They are just perfectly balanced in their style and are raw. I've been listening for probably 10 years.    2) What is your favorite song(s)? Why? What is it about this song(s) that influences you? I have a different favorite every day so its impossible. Really anything from the first 4 albums is my favorite.    3) Have you Been to a Metallica Concert? If so which concert(s)? I was so cloes to buying tickets to Boston a couple weeks ago but they sold out.    4) How many people do you know who(friends, family, coworkers, person you meet on the train) listen to metallica? My brother listens but onlyy because of me. My history teacher is a fan to. he used to be James Hetfield's bartender in Berkley, Ca.    5) What do you like about Metallica that other bands dont have? Its difficult to explain. I;d say its the balance. I never get bored with Metallica.    6) Besideds the songs in your opinion, what influence does the band/band members have on people, society, yourself?  Well James is a recovering addict so he has a message to give. Also, in sings like The God that Failed and Until it Sleeps, Hetfield talks about cancer and the deaths of both of his parents from it. It is very influential.  Also the death of Cliff Burton, the bassist, was life changing.  7) Anything else that you may want to include!!! please feel free to do so!!!!!!! Anyone who doesn't know Metallica should. They have changed the lives of Millions.    Im really depending on all you Metallica fans to help me with this essay. My teacher doesnt think that Metallica should be recognized as People of this Era!!!! Its your opinion!!!! so say it loud say it proud and help me prove that Metallica really is an influence on the people of today and that they are worthy of being recognized as People of the Modern Era!!!!!!    No problem. i love metallica.|`|b6GLnqiSaa	1) I've listened to them for more than 10 years now, they were around b4 I was born  2) enter sandman, sad but true, one, the shortest straw, the god that failed, my friend of misery, wherever I may roam, the unforgiven, and nothing else matters  3) no  4) my brother, my father, and most of my friends like them  5) they are a classic metal band,not so much heavy metal bands were around in the early 80's, at least bands that were as heavy as them  6) a lot of people like them, they are very famous, enter sandman is  5 on the top songs of all time  7) they are just a GREAT band!|`|nDQOwAA3aa	1)well i like the heavy bass and the message behind most of their songs and since i was about 7 off and on and then really got into them when i was about 13  2)one it just sounds good but it is deep and pretty dark and its about a man who gets his legs and arms blown off by a land mine while he is in the army he also can't speak, see, or hear  3)sadly no i have not  4)i know about a 12 or 13  5)well bands like pantera have that sound but not that message or story to their songs  6)well nothing much i think lars is mad at me for ilegally downloading his music|`|CZszdtemaa	1) Why you you like Metallica and for how long have you listened to them?    Every song is a classic. Since the release of Death Magnetic. I mean I bought St. Anger on its release but didn't really get into them until september '08 and haven't stopped listening to them since. I now own all their albums and cannot wait until their next.      2) What is your favorite song(s)? Why? What is it about this song(s) that influences you?    Well today it's Fuel but I know it will be different tomorrow. Their songs just seem to make sense.      3) Have you Been to a Metallica Concert? If so which concert(s)?    No but I know I'm going to.      4) How many people do you know who(friends, family, coworkers, person you meet on the train) listen to metallica?    The vast majority of people I know.      5) What do you like about Metallica that other bands dont have?    Robert Trujillo.      6) Besideds the songs in your opinion, what influence does the band/band members have on people, society, yourself?    Quite a big one considering the size of their fanbase.

u8ia6oKxaa	They do it since they want to be evil and create controversy.  Bands like Mayhem basically gained a reputation from members commiting suicide, killling each other, using animal heads on stage.    I think its abit over the top most of the time, especially Gorgoroth, but I'd say bottom line is because they want the attention whether its good or bad    And those bands you mentioned are not satanic.  some actual satanic bands are    Dissection  Diecide  Murdok  Gorgoroth  Impaled Nazarene|`|nCr1N1Byaa	Because they want to shock people... Controversy is "cool", you know... That's why (so called) shock rockers like Alice Cooper or artists like Ozzy used snakes, chicken and bats in their shows too... To make people talk about them    And I wouldn't exactly call those bands satanic...Some black metal bands *do* defend the satanic ideology - "Gorgoroth" (like you mentioned) and "Mayhem" for example, if I remember correctly|`|283tO9j9aa	Because they like to provoke and offend people. It doesn't work very well.    None of those bands are Satanic, that sort of thing is mostly done by Norwegian Black Metal people who burn churches. It's not all of them, just a little group that cause a lot of trouble.    In my opinion, they're just doing what Alice Cooper, Kiss, Ozzy and W.A.S.P. did, except failing because they do it to upset people instead of doing it to entertain.|`|y1xPK3Txaa	Because it's controversial.    And no, none of them are satanic, although Cradle of Filth is the Bon Jovi of black metal.|`|wO5FP6Mqaa	I'm not really sure what you're referring to.  None of the bands you mentioned are Satanic Metal.|`|UnsZKr4saa	Shock value.  Don't take that too seriously.    No, no and no.|`|ibDadEHDaa	to shock their crowd.     no, lamb of god, in flames and cradle of filth are POSERS not satanists, there's a big difference.     gorgoroth as well.|`|8Xg9op2Iaa	They basically exist to be different and to cause controversy. I think it used to be that when people were executed, and things related to that, their heads would be paraded around on pikes... Maybe the bands think that it's funny...
0cc7b69ea6b5f359aa006de2a67d9086aa	Hi Radio, Love Murray Street and listen to it quite often.      At one time or another any of the songs could be my favorite.  I mostly lean toward "Karen Revisited" for the most part.  Murry Street is my third favorite album from SY.        Thanks for posting...|`|0kRzuzmVaa	i have only listened yo one sonic youth song before. ( superstar) which was great.  i think i will give sonic youth a try. good song|`|Z5mmaFK0aa	Pretty good I have always respected SY. whenever I think of them I think of this User a long time ago on here. She was so cute she played guitar and posted a Q "How do I get this sound?" and it was a SY video of them doing some of their Noise Punk Feed Back stuff just loud Feed Back lol. She said "I tried screws, a hammer, nails a drill and I just cant get it." LOL so I told her how to make the Feed Back noise and she was so Happy and Elated lol.     Anyway, I have always respected them but not a huge fan|`|AA11518803	One can really hear the VU influence on this track. Good pick, great record. Do you think Beck owns a "I am not Thurston Moore" t-shirt? Or do you think he just picks up a guitar and demonstrates that fact?     (and i love Beck too)|`|7B2s7maWaa	I refuse to believe he is not Beck. lol.    I really liked this song.  I am liking what I have heard by Sonic Youth so far. Thanks for posting and sharing. :]|`|7fEVNng5aa	Nice, Radio Waves. Not what I was expecting, given the (very) little exposure to Sonic Youth I've had|`|yctQjQDTaa	Thanks again radio waves! I have become a HUGE Sonic Youth fan over the past two months, but I still need to hear a lot more from them because UMG removes a lot of their youtube videos :(     I loved "Empty Page" and the "I AM NOT BECK" thing was hilarious XD. I will definitely try to get Murray Street, along with Sonic Nurse, Dirty and Washing Machine at some later point in time, but right now I still need to get Evol and Sister =/      Oh and just to put this out there, this song is still my favorite from SY: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSc8957Fo...    Thanks for another amazing song, Radio Waves!|`|2i6TPlauaa	Thurston's not Beck, he's more of a.........      Very good|`|AA12301664	understated excellence    :)|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	Hey Radio.  Great, great track. I kind of took a break from Sonic Youth after being kind of underwhelmed by A Thousand Leaves and decided to get back into it when this came out. This record was great (and this is one of my favorite songs on it). I remember seeing them live right around this time, when Jim O'Rourke joined and they just seemed re-energized. Murray Street is really good, like late 80s/early 90s good at parts.|`|ayS0085raa	I have a lot of catching up to do with Sonic Youth. Different to the old SY I'm used to, but still recognisable as them. Love this... great to hear Thurston's voice not buried under layers of noise, actually, and it sounds great here.  :)|`|wEpwWVhJaa	Thanks waves, it was very cool. Any implied physical similarity to Beck Hansen was overstated.|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	There are so many sides to this band.  I love this side in particular.

hvJQSUOQaa	"Parents need to know that, while teens are definitely going to want to watch this comic book-like fantasy drama, it's at the far end of iffy due to its significant graphic violence. A central teen character (who is incapable of getting injured) frequently suffers debilitating injuries (burning, falls, mutilation), only to walk away unscathed; there are some disturbingly gory murders (heads cut open, bodies impaled by knives and other sharp objects); and explosive images of potential Armageddon are frequent. The show also has some relatively mild sexual content and language to watch out for, but the violence is the big issue here.    Families can talk about the nature of the word "hero" and what it means in everyday life. Do people need to have super-human powers to be heroic? Do we inherit our special abilities from our parents, or are they a fluke of nature? And is being drastically different from everyone else a curse or a blessing? Since the ensemble cast includes a diverse mix of sexes, ethnicities, and personality types, families can also discuss cultural bias and sexism. Are male superheroes more powerful than females -- and why do we often assume that they are? Are Americans more heroic than people from other nations -- and why is it such a rarity to see a "foreign" superhero?"    Basically: Violence.

People will tell you what is wrong.  2nd ignore where the complainer wants you to go fix it.  They always want you to go fix it where the last guy fixed it.  Well if that was the right place it would still be fixed.  3rd break it down. pick a point in the middle and look forward and backward. See where the trouble is from the middle.  You now have cut the trouble shooting in half.  4th be diligent and persistent. Use passed successes to help you work this through.  5th don't be lazy or cheap if something needs to be replaced do it. Trying to salvage something that is broke beyond repair is a waste of time.  6th when all else fails call for help.  and 7th it usually is the last place you look.

nci2WOYXaa	For me I think i'd be more prone to agree with you but i'd be able to see where your friend is coming from too. To be in a marriage with someone, there are so many compromises you have to make, you can't just quit the job you have if you don't like it cause you have to support a group of people rather than yourself, you have to plan "family time' rather than just going out and hanging out with friends or something. One of my friends actually told me last night that he was tired of hanging out and was ready for the whole marriage thing. That surprised me actually cause it still feels like we haven't lived enough yet. For me probably more than my other friends I feel like I could do what i'm doing now for years to come. I wouldn't say i'm exciting but what keeps my life interesting is the freedom to do different things, experience different things, figure out who I am, not have to worry about supporting or being tied to one person. I wouldn't be good in that type of situation so i'd be more prone to think that life wouldn't really work out for me as a married person.|`|qT73NYDzaa	I think it was a heavy movie----but she showed bi-polar tendencies and you have to remember they got married because they were pregnant (never a good reason to get married.)  I do think marriage is a lot of work and commitment, but I don't think it is as bad as they portrayed.  Remember, it was a movie!|`|lmvG5Sj1aa	I thought it as a boring, slow movie and didn't make it through the whole thing. I did not like the movie at all.

AA11608168	Steph just went home last night.  It was so emotional and very classy on her end.  She knew that the romance wasn't there on his end.

I also think she could be the settling down type.      I also love Jillian, but don't think that she's as into him as Mel.      Molly -- Immature and I don't think she knows what she's ready for!

z2OfsA0Jaa	weed  alcohol is dangerous, but weed is illegal...which makes it 10x more fun!    smoking weed in moderation is fun, you need to get alot of alcohol to get that full feeling    weed hightens your senses and alcohol lowers it and makes you dumb|`|jUEoujN2aa	idk i've never smoked weed before so all i can say is drinking|`|uKpi4I5Oaa	eating....while..watching tv. makes watching tv. more fun! :)|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	drinking, when people drink they do stupid stuff & its amusing, when smoking weed people get lazy & thats boring.... so i'd say drinking.|`|5J0sIvksaa	Try Jesus.|`|wnkj0b41aa	Neither! That kinda stuff will make you have a bad time.|`|e28P8gWraa	Smoking weed is better for chilling at the end of a day, and going on road trips and adventures. Plus when you wake up you dont feel crappy. Drinking is better for parties, hang outs, or with a group of friends.    Oh and be careful mixing, Never get drunk and smoke weed. Youll get the spins bad and youll probably throw up.|`|AA12383908	Both can get you in a heap of trouble.|`|AA11369490	for me drinking  dont know about weed b/c i sould never touch it|`|azNO6v4Yaa	neither   i have not tried it before|`|G0y5Orooaa	If you're going out, having people over, or are just socializing with others and having a good time, alcohol for sure.

Qih2hKqkaa	Public school is not teaching.  It's an indoctrination!  Public schools have failed America miserably.  Get your kids out of public school before they become morons or get shot by some nut case who brings a gun to school!|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	safer, can move at own pace    cons:  no social interaction. will not be able to tolerate other people. no friends from school.|`|8UfyHGdVaa	Well your home have more flexible hours learn faster cos' you are the only pupil but. your social life will go down since you are home all the time|`|lwDz2bE8aa	there are no advantages  go to public school|`|I1K6SC43aa	Advantages:    Can't beat the commute.  The teacher (your parent) can focus more on you instead of many more student.  They say home schooled kids test better than others.    Disadvantages:    The social aspect is lacking.  You aren't as exposed to new surroundings and learning to adjust to unfamiliar places.|`|7xHfvMIZaa	No friends, no snow days, no excuse for not 'understanding' homework. your siblings are your classmates.    Pluses? Your teacher can give you help whenever you need it, and you can move at your own pace.|`|TEnvIAjraa	I was never home schooled but I've seen someone go through home schooling...    they are very very smart, but they lack so many social skills, he's 14 but you would think he's 9 or 10...  I really feel bad for the kid, but maybe he's better off in the long run not having to deal with high school... then again you really learn from that experience so.. i'd say it's a disadvantage overall|`|B0XamShQaa	It's safer  All the high schools have drugs and beer, no matter what.    But your children will grow up in seclusion and when they realize in their teens, they'll seriously hate you.|`|Gge8MNTKaa	advantages are that you can get a better education.|`|VgE6HSdtaa	advantage :    one on one learning, thus resulting in your learning much more than being surrounded by obnoxious teens that are loud and annoying, hence you don't learn as much      disadvantage:   isolation from peers; which could get SO boring|`|pWnsUHMBaa	advan.  get more attention from teacher  get work done faster  probably be smarter  no bitches  disad.  no friends  no boys  no talking  no socializing|`|YzCTq13caa	Advantage: You can focus better  Disadvantage: You can't sleep around with the school sl*ts.|`|yZqRYFsPaa	im homeschooled and it sux although there are some ups like not having to wake up so early and eating food wen u want stuff like that.but you will miss your friends|`|7Msk7HhKaa	Advantages would be that you've got much more direct attention, and specified help to allow you to progress through material much faster. learning is accelerated as well as better-absorbed. The down-side is that you don't get the social interaction that you would at a public school, so it's that much harder when you go into the workforce.|`|1UAuRQtfaa	I feel there are pros and cons either way. pro would be there would be a closer bond between you and your children. also i dont know if you've seen the dugger family on tlc but they all are very humble people i think this is partially because of them being home schooled but also how their parents raised them. no they wont hate you when your older some children prefer to be home schooled. the cons how ever are your children may lack social skills that will hold them back later in life. but for that they have conventions for kids that are home schooled to meet together and talk about there experiences and meet people they can relate with. also a pro would be maybe your children would be less exposed to drugs, violence, sex ext. I think either way it is a personal desision for you and your family either way good luck hope it works out.|`|AoxzoE9Caa	an advantage would be, no one would make fun of you,  and you can go to school in your pajamas,   disadvantaged would be, you wouldn't have many friends.|`|d15d582a53577bcf335f0863223462abaa	Advantages - You can possibly learn more, depending on your curriculum    Disadvantages - You'll be less socially adept, colleges might not want you, you'll have little experience with the real world, your "teacher" won't have any professional certification most likely.|`|1SIpJNoSaa	i'm home schooled!!! its great! free but hard to find friends. i know of allot of home schooled people home schooled!|`|sWmxy9Lhaa	Advntage- u get taught by yourself, always center of attention  disadvantage-u dnt have any frnds|`|vQtSPEUGaa	A: freedom to learn what you want or need    D: Becomes socially hand-i-capped    A: Safe enviorment fre from violence and drugs    D: don't get to expeirence to much outside your door    A: (can' think of any more)    D: No real PROFESSIONALS teaching student|`|YTLePvkVaa	Advantage: You dont have to use dirty public school toilets    Disadvantage: You will feel lazy being in your comfort zone environment.|`|N1yMxlkUaa	if you're home schooled, and get a crush on your teacher, you're up a creek!!!!!!|`|YjfGt6b0aa	i think the negitive consepts slightly out balances the possitive   your child wouldnt be as confident  your learning pattern would have to be strict  and it would make your child struggle to destinguish teacher parent and non study time parent.  this could also make the child feel a little traped with no freedom.    however public schools your child may not get the attention and focus they need from a tutor.|`|9OdcDLRXaa	Advantages:   wake up anytime you want.  you can work at your own pace.  you can get a full time job  dont have to worry bout what you look like or what u are wearing  NO DRAMA.  dont have to deal with teachers or kids you dont like.   if you work hard enough you can graduate early   lots of free time  dont have to worry about paying for stuff( dances/fees/ect.)  .. theres a ton more    DISadvantages:  you dont get to see your friends .  dont get to do the whole graduating thing.(cap & gown&walk)  no prom.  stuff like that   miss out on
365967a53f2df58d865575346fcc1152aa	No. He could've contacted the ranger station, and they could have gone up there and told her. The ranger got there on his snowmobile to tell them that the roads were closed, didn't he? He could've told Sharon about Noah just as easily.|`|nrqWwQBXaa	that was dumb that he went there why didn't he have jack go. i am getting sick of sharon i do not like her. she needs to mind her own Business and find some one other then nick. yes they have a kid together but that does not mean she needs to be hanging all over nick?|`|5Bn1QsWmaa	i think he had a right to go, seeing what happened before with Cassie, i completely understand the urgency on his path, also to know that its his kid, and Sharon's kid, what would u do? had it been your child, i will want someone to find me, if i was away, to let me know that my child was in the hospital, even though he was recuperating.|`|ZfPCgVooaa	Nick loves Sharon. Bye, bye Phyllis|`|FwU6GL4Laa	I think if Nick was really committed to his marriage he wouldn't have went to the cabin, and if he did he would have taken his wife with him.|`|vO9fPCm2aa	He should have had Jack go but he wanted to go and you know how stubborn these Newman's are! :~)|`|qAoM2Jp5aa	It wasn't crucial for Nick to go to the cabin, but he went because he really loves Sharon and he wants to be there for her. Plain and Simple.|`|AA11111233	No, Nick should not have gone to the cabin.  But then again, Sharon needed to get away for some peace and quiet to clear her head, therefore, she never bothered to take along her cell phone, so how else was she supposed to know?  Nick wanted her to know right away, so Sharon could go down there, so she wouldn't have any deja vu regrets of the time she abandoned Cassie, and the same thing happened to her while Sharon was gone.  But I guess Mother Nature wanted to show everyone what a crappy mother Sharon is, that all she cars about are her frustrations and her loneliness, and that's why she brought on the blizzard, right?|`|PRDZmeiEaa	I agree 100%|`|dPULl5hjaa	Yeah, Nick should have went to the cabin because Phyllis is a hemorrhoid!|`|AA10382814	Sure it was important enough to tell her , especially since it meant that they got it on again....Bye Phyllis!

RGcM4lIIaa	skinny girl.|`|yuXGsNUCaa	I don't care either, but if I had to pick it'd be the stick girl because I've noticed these days that many guys are going for girls that have more meat on them now, so I always like to go for the latter.

QelWHSZRaa	Darn it hon....    I can't even predict my own unpredictableness. LOL ...Us Aquarius are unpredictable and my sista tiacola couldn't have said it best.     ....Um, just cuz we don't show emotions don't mean we are ice cubes WTF.... we are too sensitive and hide behind a mask to protect this sensitive sh*t. That is why we have tons of friends and stuff. Us dude love our freedom and don't even think of telling us what to do or um, do this and that .    ....thats a No  No.  us aquarian have our own time schedule and ...er.... and we miss the train often LOL. krappers. We end up in the caboose or something.|`|l3b0hjdWaa	Dating an Aquarius is like searching for a treasure chest.|`|AA11899483	that depends on the birth chart, moon, venus mars etc in relationships. my cousin is an aqua with picses venus and damn hes sensitive, and very lovey dovey, he is very possessive and gets jealous easily, i think maybe someone with an aquarius venus maybe quite detached though.|`|5769f110474fd157a0d6c0b3ca8ac6d8aa	Maybe.  It's true I'm not the jealous type usually but I'm totally loyal and faithful.  I'd never cheat.    But there is a lot of truth in what you say.  However, I'm not sure I'm worse than any other member of the horoscope!|`|rnqgiRkWaa	MY BEST FRIEND IS AN AQUARIUS AND SHE IS THE JEALOUS TYPE ALSO WHEN HER AND HER B.F BROKE UP SHE STOKERISHLY CALLED HIM AND TXTD HIM A COUPLE TIMES A DAY AND SHE IS THE CLINGY TYPE..    SO NO NOT ALL AQUARANS ARE LIKE THAT.     THATS LIKE SAYING ALL JEWS HAVE BIG NOSES OR BLACKS ALL SPEAK EBONICS OR ALL WHITES ARE STUCK UP CONSERVATIVES.     DON'T GENERALIZE.|`|PCAlAoDsaa	Aquarius people are quite independent and unpredictable. When they find a person that they really care about and love, then they will change their ways to make a relationship work.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	Nah, we're not all that bad once you figure out how we relate to love and relationships. I will say that the men are a little more detached and aloof generally speaking than Aquarian women so they will be a little harder to read and understand. Most Aquarians in general are actually very sensitive deep down on the inside but we don't display those emotions outwardly because it's awkward for us. It's because we're afraid of being ridiculed for how we feel. The disappearing act is anything to take personal. Aquas just need space and time to themselves every once in a while just to recharge our batteries. Not all people of this sign like partners that are independent either. I like men that are committed to me and not flighty at all and I know quite a few like that. Don't go by the stereotypes that you hear. There are some Aquarians like that but trust me when I say there are a good number that aren't.|`|FyZsJh0waa	i dated an aquarius for a year...... he was very predictable.. and he was very jealous of everything(reason i broke up with him)    it really depends on their chart|`|AgC30lhbaa	Aquarians are themselves quite independent and unpredictable. However, if they find someone that they really care about then they will be willing to change their ways to make a relationship work.|`|n53BNB8taa	Yes it is true. But it is also depends on their other planet signs e.g. venus OR mars or moon in aq can be unpredictable but if they got cap in venus, or moon in taurus or even in mars in leo they can be loyal in love relationship.    so look at other Aspects as well.|`|158c89bed17d0de1cff6f88332af3f61aa	Aloof, unpredictable, emotionally disconnected and unstable. I have experienced all of these with an Aquarius man.  I am Leo and also his polar opposite in the zodiac; when it was good it was really and when it was bad it was bad. Of course we are no longer together but still remain close as friends. Its all going to depend on your birth charts, maturity and a willingness to work at this relationship.
hws7aXBdaa	NO.|`|a1pmr73vaa	True.    I tend to attract the stranger kind each time.|`|kG6VWsGvaa	Not necessarily true. It's happened to me, but it doesn't happen to everyone. You could be in a physically abusive relationship and once you finally get out of it, your next partner could be verbally abusing you. Not any better, I'd say...|`|Lj2mo4ooaa	T.  People learn from their mistakes.  Even parents get better with each kid they raise.|`|Pz0Np7JLaa	I find that it is true. You realize different things about yourself, like what you like and dislike in a significant other, more and more not only as time goes on but through each relationship.   My boyfriends get better with time....So this is my question...Do i keep the Good boyfriend i have, or continually keep trying to get better and better guys? Nah, i think ill keep him.|`|RVj0EnXIaa	no not really, i mean i have someone now who i care about a lot, but i mean it doesnt get better and better no|`|D24Npt4eaa	People end up with better mates and relationships when they get to know each other very well before they take it to a sexual level.  The better you know someone, the easier and more comfortable you are together and the better you COMMUNICATE the better the relationship will be.  PERSONAL EXPERIENCE.|`|ww3ukbdVaa	not really|`|XaFYUMRSaa	The b/f i have now is the best,I can't even think of a better person.|`|frwlypDWaa	My remarried friends are batting about .500 in that department.

AA11951392	I am going on the 9th day of the 8 month 1993     Your birth on the 9th day of the month adds a tone of idealism and humanitarianism to your nature. You become one who can work easily with people because you are broadminded, tolerant and generous. You are ever sensitive to others' needs and feelings, and even if the other numbers in your core makeup don't show it, you are very sympathetic and compassionate. Your feeling run deep and you often find yourself in dramatically charged situations. This 9 energy always tends to give more that it gets.    Personal Year for Number: 1   This is start of a new 9 year cycle - A time for change, & new BEGINNINGS. This is an ACTION YEAR: The influence of this year will have a significant effect for you to plan your long term goals, & to consider where you would like to be in a few years time. An inability to begin a new venture this year may delay your prospects until the start of the next nine year cycle. You should clarify your goals & start working toward their achievement. This is a year to stand on your own two feet, to attain independence & be determined. Any opportunity which comes your way, take advantage of it without hesitation. (Opportunities though, should be considered carefully, as impulsiveness isnt likely to be helpful). Plan & begin anything new - or make changes or expand, at least, widen your interests & activities. Now is the time to ACT. Hard work may be necessary to get things moving. Independence is paramount. This may be a time to go it  alone particularly in relationships/partnerships & especially if a relationship/partnership came to a close last year (in the nine Personal Year). If a situation has been of concern, this is the time to break free or make any necessary adjustments. This is also a time, to express courage, assertiveness & confidence without arrogance or impulsiveness. Any change of direction made this year will probably be due to your own efforts. Make use of this POWERFUL, period & use its fullest advantage.     Life Path 3  The number 3 Life Path is one that emphasizes expression, sociability, and creativity as the lesson to be learned in this life. Here we are apt to find the entertainers of the world, bright, effervescent, sparkling people with very optimistic attitudes. A truly gifted 3 possesses the most exceptional creative skills, normally in the verbal realm, writing, speaking, acting, or similar endeavors. The lesson to be learned with a 3 life path is that of achievement through expression. The bright side of this path stresses harmony, beauty and pleasures; of sharing your creative talents with the world. Capturing your capability in creative self-expression is the highest level of attainment for this life path. The characteristics of the 3 are warmth and friendliness, a good conversationalist, social and open. A good conversationalist both from the standpoint of being a delight to listen to, but even more importantly, one who has the ability to listen to others. Accordingly, the life path 3 produces individuals who are always a welcome addition to any social situation and know how to make others feel at home. The creative imagination is present, if sometimes latent, as the 3 may not be moved to develop his talent. The approach to life tends to be exceedingly positive, however, and your disposition is almost surely sunny and open-hearted. You effectively cope with all of the many setbacks that occur in life and readily bounce back for more. It is usually easy for you to deal with problems because you can freely admit the existence of problems without letting them get you down. You have good manners and seem to be very conscious of other people's feelings and emotions. Life is generally lived to the fullest, often without much worry about tomorrow. You are not very good at handling money because of a general lack of concern about it. You spend it when you have it and don't when you don't. On the negative side, a 3 may be so delighted with the joy of living that the life becomes frivolous and superficial. You may scatter your abilities and express little sense of purpose. The 3 can be an enigma, for no apparent reason you may become moody and tend to retreat. Escapist tendencies are not uncommon with the 3 life path, and you find it very hard to settle into one place or one position. Guard against being critical of others, impatient, intolerant, or overly optimistic. Typically, the life path 3 gives an above-average ability in some art form. This can encompass painting, interior decorating, landscaping, crafts, writing, music, or the stage, or all of the above. You are apt to be a happy, inspired person, constantly seeking the stimuli of similar people. Your exuberant nature can take you far, especially if you are ever able to focus your energies and talents.    Love & Blessings   Milly|`|rnqgiRkWaa	Number for Today: 5    You're so quick witted and restless today that you may consider taking a trip or being more social than is usually your nature. You're also prone to boredom, so look for new ways to tackle old problems. Today is wonderful for self promotion, retail, or selling anything.
Ca8i226Xaa	Yes, Ruby will get Sam to use his powers again. I have the feeling that Ruby is really not on the brothers side. I thought the Angels wanted Sam and Dean to stop the breaking of all the seals so that the Devil would not be free to walk the earth. Many of the seals have already been broken, and I have the feeling that we may see the devil later this year, or next season.    My question is what will the angels do when Sam uses his powers again, they threatened to kill him. What an excellent show!

7Cr2O7I4aa	DEFINITELY ROBERT PATTINSON! you cant comparre those 2 people!!! lol, and deifnitely twilight. hsm and zac are too cheesy, i mean come on!! and im not hating on zac and hsm lovers, this is just my opinion. but rob is personally a lot cuter and hotter. i LOVED his hair before he cut it and his potrayal of edward cullen in twilight is amazing! stephanie meyer said herself that rob was exactly how she saw edward in her mind. twilight is an amzing book and movie, it potrays so much love and passion, and raw talent, somehtign hsm just doesnt have. hsm doesnt have a good storyline to follow, whereas twilights is love can conquer all. i just think that over all, twilight and rob are both more relateable. the vamps in twilight are just a metaphor, its saying that  want someone so bad, but u cant have him/her. hsm is too kiddish, just a franchise for disney to make more money. so twilight and rob are defintely hotter than hsm and zac.|`|lM2x2i0maa	Rob just cuz he's more manly and Twilight is amazing!!!!!!|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	Zac Efron and Twilight.  I love Edward Cullen more than Zac, but Rob isn't as hot when he's tan and has a beard...     I love HSM too... Zanessa hehe.   x]    I love;  Twilight, HSM, Rob and Zac, so yeah...   But if I had to choose;  Twilight and Zac... or HSM and Zac... hmmm... i dunno really.    cool question *|`|NY2fpmvPaa	Robert Pattinson. I loved him in Harry Potter before I even knew about Twilight. And then on the contrary, I was kind of disappointed that he was going to be Edward. I had read the books and just didn't think he was quite hot enough. But, horrendous as that movie was, he kind of grows on you in the movie and he's an okay Edward as far as hottness goes, just as long as he doesn't talk. It was like everyone's acting skills took a dive in that movie. Which is sad, because it had really good potential. Hopefully the opt to make New Moon better.    I think that Zac Efron looks too gay. In Hollywood there are two styles that are popular for the men: Looking like a homo, and looking like a homeless person. Robert Pattinson is going for the Homeless look, which I prefer over looking gay.|`|uhHfm3Azaa	duh, silly.  robert is hotter (and not gay)  and twilight is better (also, not gay)  :)        plus, who has even been talking about zac or hsm.  especially zac.  he's probably crying in his dressing room cause everyone is obsessing over rob instead of him.|`|AdEJBAkMaa	Robert Pattinson and Twilight all the way!!! =D|`|aeODdMATaa	Robert Pattinson|`|uMseesTAaa	Robert and Twilight.|`|ALDXW0Jeaa	rob for sure|`|PMVlhz8saa	Zac Efron all the like...ohmygod|`|XXGF0hzYaa	zac efron! sorry, but i dont really see the appeal in rob. he looks stoned most of the time. zac efron is so much younger looking and nicer.|`|ifYOXajoaa	Robert is HOTTER (Zac Efron is Gay.

AA10648544	Death Cab is one of the greatest indie rock bands out there.  Ben Gibbard is a true one of a kind lyricist.  His writing style is built on metaphors and symbolism that when heard behind the great sound of the rest of the band, brings chills to your body.

That would mean that in the long run they would be more concerned with helping their own pocketbook rather than helping humanity.........WHICH would make me question whether or not their gift was legitimate......or fabricated for their own gain.    My point being.......no, I would not charge. And I can't imagine that anyone would.    I wish I had the gift of "reason." To listen to people all over the world that argue with one another trying to desperately to make all of humanity see things "their way." When in truth.......we all ultimately see the same Hope. We just all take different paths to get there. I would wrap my gift of "reason" in a beautiful box with a lovely bow and hand it to each person that felt entitled for people to see things "their way." I would watch as they slowly untied the bow.....removed the paper.....and opened the box only to smile.....release the tension from their arms, close their eyes and nod a reassurance.

As I fail miserably,   Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want.   She's the girl all the bad guys want!     She likes the Godsmack and I like Agent Orange   Her cd changer's full of singers that are mad at their dad   She says she'd like to score some reefer and a forty   She'll never know that I'm the best that she'll never have     And when she walks,   All the wind blows and the angels sing.   She'll never notice me!     Cause she is watchin' wrestling   Creamin' over tough guys   Listenin' to rap metal   Turntables in her eyes     She likes 'em with a mustache   Racetrack season pass   Drivin' in a Trans-Am   Does a mullet make a man?

There she goes again   With fishnets on, and dreadlocks in her hair   She broke my heart, I wanna be sedated   All I wanted was to see her naked!     Now I am watchin' wrestling   Tryin' to be a tough guy   Listenin' to rap metal   Turntables in my eyes   I can't grow a mustache   And I ain't got no season pass   All I got's a moped...moped....moped.....     It's like a bad movie   She is lookin' through me   If you were me, then you'd be   Screamin' "Someone shoot me!"   As I fail miserably,   Tryin' to get the girl all the bad guys want.     She's the girl all the bad guys want!   She's the girl all the bad guys want!   She's the girl all the bad guys want!   She's the girl all the bad guys want!

Myself in every stranger's eyes    And now from where I stand  Upon this hill plundered from the pool  I look around, I search the skies  I shade my eyes, so nearly blind  And I see signs of half remembered days  I hear bells that chime in strange familiar ways  I recognise...

a4df001ef1d10f8710b270f5f7f51eb1aa	Emo is short for emotional so the music is more emotional, lost love and all that. It's a new kind of music. Ska is more like old school.|`|8bffa76fba75ce8c720c31cc4024cd00aa	emo is like emotional punk rock with songs about pining for lost love and being all nervous around girls.    SKA is like fast reggae and mumbling.|`|54965632c81591216a7d3e31334e0ccdaa	A good ten years.  Ska was around a decade ago, emo is fairly new.  Also, as I understnad it ska (music) is closely related to scat and jazz, while emo (music) is more related to being a whiner.  Not 100% sure though.  I'm a good decade too old to really be in the loop.|`|3debac9b8bf3ec76c3e5f6fec5f17e64aa	Ska bands use other instruments like saxophones, flute, trumpets, horns...

The ONLY good Ska band was The Clash!    Emo is a modern cross of punk, pop and indy.     The only thing they had in common would be their common bond in punk, but since Ska was old School Punk, and Emo comes from New/Modern Punk, they animals aren't even all that similar at all.|`|AA11405201	Ska bands use trumpets and all that stuff..|`|AA12285394	none, both sucks!

AA10401724	So many people are divided on this movie, but I liked Alexander and I thought Angelina Jolie did an excellent job.

And here is why!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    I love shoes and I  have at least 16 pairs of shoes  I HATE going shopping for shoes.I spend so long trying to pick a pair I like . Back in June I went shopping for a pair of shoes and brought my husband with. Big mistake lol ( didn't help that he was rushing me). I was in there for literally 2 hours and didn't even buy a pair. I went to another store and found a pair I thought I liked and returned them. I did this literally about 4 times until I found a pair I liked.    I prefer expensive pair they last longer. The longer they last the longer it is before I have to spend so many hours looking for a darn pair of shoes! Better for me because I absolutely hate shopping for shoes. It seems I am never satisfied with what I get . And you think I would be,I mean they only go on your feet. Not like EVERYONE you pass looks at them.     Playless shoes don't last long.If you don't like shopping for shoes then I advise you get the expensive pair they last longer.    Have fun shopping!|`|ec86a57dbcf4a6d81d54126f0bdb5e15aa	2 expensive pairs of shoes. They last longer. I used to buy Payless Shoes, and they fall apart in about a month.

If you can get it through listening to the music and the lyrics, then there is none.|`|63f6e646e368bbcda35d0644fc5050a5aa	It's a song about his obsession with someone, a love he can't have, the fact that he's in denial about the fact that it's not reciprocal and the emotions that go along with it. In the end he says "I can't take my mind off you... 'Til I find somebody new" which is basically his way of accepting the fact that he's obsessive and simply will focus that feeling on someone else eventually.     I love this song too and the whole CD "O" is great actually. I love Cold Water and Delicate as well. I can't wait for his next album.    --- I think the theory about it being his clarinet teacher's daughter may be an urban legend. I read the same thing somewhere else and I just don't buy it. I don't think he even plays clarinet. who knows though. perhaps it is true... ---|`|AA10405966	The song is about his obsession with the daughter of a clarinet teacher! So the 'blower' in this context means 'one who blows a clarinet'! Of course, if he'd used the correct English it would have been called 'The clarinet teachers daughter' but maybe he thought that would have been too obvious.

People like lil wayne degrade women, talk about how rich they are, and how much sex they get. Rap music wasn't meant to be like this. Rap was meant to communicate a point across. What kind of point, is "I get money!!" or "I get sex!" Its not a point, its stupid.

d90117e69095d6a8123c49bc5d97699aaa	their hometown is  "Resembool"...  Resembool is a village in the country/nation state of "Amestris"     HERE'S THE MAJOR LOCATIONS:    >>Central   Built on the site of an ancient city that vanished centuries ago, Central is the seat of government in Amestris. The National Library, Central Headquarters, and Laboratory 5 are all located in Central.    >>East City   Located in a backwater region near the desert, East City was the home base of Colonel Mustang and his entire outfit for most of the early portions of the anime. It's reasonably close to Lior, Resembool, and Marcoh's hometown, making it a sort of central hub for some of Ed and Al's early adventures.    >>Ishbal   Officially conquered and annexed by Amestris several years ago, Ishbal was the focal point of the Eastern Rebellion. Almost the entire region was wiped out by war, and the passing lives of its people were harnessed for the production of a Philosopher's Stone.    >>Lior   The desert city of Lior is home to a unique ethnic group who, like the Ishbalans, hold religion in high regard. They were formerly under the control of Father Cornello, the so-called "Prophet", but he was deposed by the Elric brothers, leading to a period of civil war that nearly destroyed the entire city.    >>Resembool   This far-flung town is the home of the Elrics, and a great deal of important events happened here. In Episode 43, The Stray Dog, hints of a forgotten past can be seen by the river said to have once brought life from Central into the town. (The rubble of what appears to have been a large stone building forms the stream's banks.)    >>Xenotime (Note: Only appears in the anime and novel Land of Sand)   Xenotime was once known as the "City of Gold", due to its rich deposits of said element. They sold their wares far and wide, gaining great wealth, but when the gold was exhausted, the town fell into disrepair. The land-baron Mugwar attempted to use the toxic Red Water hidden in the mines to forge Red Stones, so that he could transmute gold and return the city to its former glory. However, the Elric Brothers caught on to him and, together with the sons of alchemist Nash Tringum, stopped his plan.    >>New Hiessgart (video game only)   A city founded and governed by Professor Wilhelm Eiselstein, a member of the Ten Alchemists, when Hiessgart was overrun by chimeras. The city is relatively new and lies somewhere between Resembool and Central City. It appears only in the first video game, Fullmetal Alchemist and the Broken Angel, where it acts as the story's primary setting.    >>Siam-Sid (video game only)   Once a gleaming metropolis, the former capital of Lebis is now little more than ruins. Long ago, the king of Lebis attempted to create the perfect human being, unleashing an untold horror which destroyed the entire civilization in a single night. The city and the fate of its residents are often referenced in the anime, but are only directly dealt with in the second video game, Curse of the Crimson Elixir.    >>The Underground City   An old city that once stood on the site of what is now Central City. Four centuries ago, Hohenheim used the city's entire population to create a Philosopher's Stone, and pulled the city itself beneath the earth to keep the deed a secret, as well as perpetuate the myth. Dante used the city as her headquarters to create new stones. In the manga, it is a massive underground complex where the mysterious "Father" lives.    >>Xerxes (manga only)   Though not much detail is known, it was a city east of Ishbal that was destroyed long ago. As the manga depicted, the entire civilization was destroyed in a single night, with its entire population sacrificed to create the Philosopher's Stone, which was in turn used to create Envy.    >>Briggs (manga only)   The northern base of Amestris located in a mountain range, commanded by Major General Olivia Mila Armstrong. It is a huge underground complex housing thousands of soldiers who regularly go out on patrols, as well as the centre for the development of non-alchemic weapons. Most if not all the soldiers there are extremely paranoid, accusing anyone whom they do not know of being spies from the nation of Drachma to the north. Apparently, only one incident involving patrolling soldiers successfully being attacked occurred over a period of a month about twenty years before the arrival of Major General Armstrong; the attacker was identified to be a woman, though not a spy from Drachma. Gaiden chapter "Tales of the Master" revealed that the woman was actually a young Izumi Curtis.|`|fc03e180d6dad5f405fc5246d1cdf6e5aa	Resembool-hometown  Central  East City  Lior   those are all i can think of at the moment, which is embarassing cuz it's my favorite anime and manga.

PleLteu3aa	kinda hard to hear, you should project more. from what I coud hear.. it sounded really good though!|`|Ndw34J0daa	You sound like you sing with passion, which I love to hear. But that's not going to make you famous. You sound more like you are trying to emulate a sound than actually singing. Maybe if you took voice lessons it would tap some natural potential. That being said, I wouldn't mind hearing you in a karaoke bar.|`|jCy0J2ueaa	It is hard to here your voice in this video all i can here is the music|`|IBqjTKfWaa	i can barely even hear you're voice, so it's hard to say.|`|45c83734a8a81c7d2a0cc227b9c47cc2aa	Just as everyone else said I really couldn't hear you that well... what i did hear you definitely sound nice and you should take advantage of  some of the prev. pointers and suggestions like projecting your voice... Good Job though!

Stupid trick,,,but yes I believe in real magic it's all around us.|`|YxXBrRq4aa	yes i believe    1st trick is done by the colors of the cards they show you a black and red king, queen, and jack like king dia, king clu, qu hrts, qu clu, jac dia, jack spad the next set of six cards has the opposite colors of them...ki hrt, ki sp, qu dia, qu sp, ja hrt, ja cl so none of the first set is in the second set but it looks like it cuz stil three of each color    2nd trick no idea

It can't be too crazy, people, like myself, can see through it.|`|NwpGhT31aa	Find someone that you know can't keep a secret then tell them and tell them not to tell anyone. lol.|`|GtPerJQraa	maybe write it on a bathroom stall. or just write it on a piece of paper and stuff it in ppls stuff. some one will read it and pass it on! :]|`|YSdwkhHRaa	That would make it easier.  Why don't you just tell people yourselves? As far as I know, your rumor isn't any different from a lie.    I heard that Tribal kid beats baby kitties with baby puppies. What a brute!|`|qNKK4hLDaa	buy a rumor seed and whisper in the rumors you want everyone to hear about, then plant it at your school|`|s7UWLOS9aa	Tell a known gossiper your secret, and just let them take care of the rest.|`|9UfzllXoaa	tell the "secret" to someone you know you cant trust to keep it. they'll tell more and more people and it'll become a rumor.

He deals the cards as a meditation  And those he plays never suspect  He doesn't play for the money he wins  He don't play for respect    He deals the cards to find the answer  The sacred geometry of chance  The hidden law of a probable outcome  The numbers lead a dance    I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier  I know that the clubs are weapons of war  I know that diamonds mean money for this art  But that's not the shape of my heart    He may play the jack of diamonds  He may lay the queen of spades  He may conceal a king in his hand  While the memory of it fades    I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier  I know that the clubs are weapons of war  I know that diamonds mean money for this art  But that's not the shape of my heart  (*)That's not the shape, the shape of my heart    And if I told you that I loved you  You'd maybe think there's something wrong  I'm not a man of too many faces  The mask I wear is one    Well, those who speak know nothin'  And find out to their cost  Like those who curse their luck in too many places  And those who fear are lost    I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier  I know that the clubs are weapons of war  I know that diamonds mean money for this art  But that's not the shape of my heart  (*)That's not the shape of my heart  That's not the shape, the shape of my heart|`|3f5c685de26b32b13965d5cb704bffceaa	shape of my heart from the movie the professional- one of my all time favorite sting songs, great reference :)|`|965e97512712faf271273958df778871aa	Wow...

AA12302625	In July 1977, Marley was found to have malignant melanoma in a football wound on his right hallux (big toe). Marley refused amputation, citing worries that the operation would affect his dancing, as well as the Rastafarian belief that the body must be "whole"    Marley may have seen medical doctors as samfai. True to this belief Marley went against all surgical possibilities and sought out other means that would not break his religious beliefs.      [edit] Collapse and treatment  The cancer spread to Marley's brain, lungs, liver, and stomach following his refusal of treatment. After playing two shows at Madison Square Garden as part of his fall 1980 Uprising Tour, he collapsed while jogging in NYC's Central Park. The remainder of the tour was subsequently cancelled.    Bob Marley played his final concert at the Stanley Theater in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on September 23, 1980.

I been through this too long  But I'll be damned if I see another chick on your arm    [Chorus:]  She go be rockin' chinchilla coats  If I let you go  Getting the house off coast  If I let you go  She gon' take everything I own  If I let you go  I can't let you go  Damn, if I let you go  She gon' rock them VVS stones  If I let you go  Couped in the 'bach or the Rolls  If I let you go  She gon' profit everything I taught  If I let you go  I can't let you go  Damn, if let you go    [Verse 1:]  Tell me how should I feel  When I know what I know,  And my female intuition  Telling me you a dog?  People told me 'bout the flames  I couldn't see through the smoke  When I need answers, accusations  What you mean you gone choke?    [Pre-Chorus 1:]  You can't stay, you gotta go.  Ain't no other chicks spending your dough  This is taking a toll, the way the story unfolds  Not the picture perfect movie everyone would've saw    [Chorus]    [Hook]    [Verse 2:]  Tell me how should I feel  When you made me belong  And the thought of you just touching her  Is what I hate most?

Why would you risk it baby? Is that the price that I pay?  But this is my show and I won't let you go  All has been paid for, and it's mine  How could you look at me  And not see all the things?

Heh... i'm kidding. but psychics can't work over the internet... you'd have to be near them... and even then., most are idiots who rumble on with mumbo jumbo|`|40947c53900ba8c2ca9c27de9533b0b8aa	Well, I can accept the fact that you're prefering the work of Tarot cards over science. I don't AGREE, but I accept it. But even then, theres a method for Tarot card interpretations. You have to consider:    -What type of deck are you using?  -What are the accepted symbols behind each card?  -Are you interpreting what you want to read only, or are you considering all of the possible symbols the cards are telling you.    In short? Just because a card is mentioning things about 'first babies', that doesn't instantly mean you're pregnant. It could refer to the first child in a house, your first ancestor, or a many other possibilities. The key concept of Tarot is tapping into the infinite and trying to regress it into at least a few different paths, but there are ALWAYS more than one path shown open.    So don't let a single symbol throw you off; Consider the other cards that come down with the others. Also, if you're doing your own reading, simply do another to see what else comes up. Avoid phone services and stick with personal one-on-one readings with a psychic you trust.    But in terms of testing for pregnancy? Go for it. Your local clinic or womans shelter can always do a quick check for you, and I'm sure it'll be free or at least low priced, depending on where you live. But keep in mind: They'll be doing scientific medical tests, not using acts of faith/tradition/pact to read it...which might just be a good contrast to have.

He smiled as he reflected on how sweet and pure his little girl was.    Tears formed in his eyes as he thought about her seeing the wonders of nature through such innocent eyes.    Suddenly she just stopped and stared at the ground. He went over to her to see what work of God had captured her attention. He noticed she was looking at two spiders mating. "Daddy, what are those two spiders doing?" she asked.    They're mating," her father replied.    What do you call the spider on top?" she asked.    That's a Daddy Longlegs," her father answered.    So, the other one is a Mommy Longlegs?" the little girl asked.    As his heart soared with the joy of such a cute and innocent question he replied "No dear. Both of them are Daddy Longlegs."

4BhIk9V0aa	It doesn't necessarily mean its a bad thing, it just means you do things without thinking them all the way through or you say things without thinking. You make rash decisions sometimes. Sometimes the first thing that comes to your mind is what you do without a second thought about how it may come out. Hope this helps.

b7e31f937a27c09ffc97c47372fa1ac4aa	Yeah.    We were decorating the gym for a dance. The A/C was off plus I had black soled shoes on, so I took off my shoes and socks that afternoon. After 3 hours of walking on the gym floor and in the hallways, the soles of my feet were jet black. I didn't even both to put shoes back on for the short walk home. I had to hose my feet off outside before going inside our house as not to get the carpets dirty. School floors are not very clean. I guess next time I'll wear sneakers or Teva sandals.|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	YUCK!!! THAT WOULD BE THE LAST PLACE I'D WALK BAREFOOT....

So now I wear flip flops.|`|dd30d07061d6ae74b156e18ca10ad7e2aa	Didn't go barefoot yet in my school days. We did PE barefoot but I don't think my feet got very dirty from that, we were supposed to wash our feet or even shower after PE but hardly anyone ever did and they didn't check up on us. Then my feet rarely get very black even in the city, one of the few times I remember getting them *black* was at a bus stop but even that wore off in a block or so walking the sidewalk... greyish or greyish brown is the most I get and indoors it's rarely more than light grey at that.|`|3f5efc790e6dee5e36a79e76df3123efaa	In school I went barefoot a lot .Alot of the girls went barefoot in drama and at track practice a lot of the girls would walk around barefoot when their events was done. Our track was asphalt, so our feet usually was black from the asphalt.

ABLeSO6kaa	Is your life really that boring, is your excitement threshold really that thick? Or do you think you never really had an interest to begin with, but just used her?|`|b5050af6348ebc55aabde293d337fc56aa	It happens....just break it up as nice as you can and get on with it|`|AA11967247	yeah, a lot when i was younger. maybe she's just not the one for you and you dont require all the drama to figure that out.|`|3d40b4f2a24630bfafce9bb96d212203aa	Yes, I been there, done that, and wrote the book on losing interest in my boyfriends. I like them initially but after awhile it isn't intriguing or exciting. It is perfectly normal, maybe you just don't have a connection or compatible with her but you like her as a person. I found it best to remain single and unattached before I commit myself to a person in the long run instead of breaking their hearts. Try to shake things up and find new ways to reconnect and if that doesn't work maybe it isn't meant to be right now.|`|f3399027b56ee13ae52644ed29eca245aa	That's life. Don't be surprise that you will want her again in the future.|`|02d09e34829f925f9d50ba2dac8dac15aa	Yes I am currently caught in that tangled web.  I just lost all interest in the bf.  I broke up.  He can't get it in his head that I just lost feelings.  Like you said there is not anyone else.  Nor do I want anyone else right now.  Sorry it is a hard thing to deal with or explain.|`|732f9ea501d1928261a4384f307586aaaa	Just ready to move on.  Isn't anything either of you have done.  That is what dating is about.|`|AA10399739	Yes. It is called, you're just not that "into" her. You like her, but your just not that "into" her.|`|82bc9240a5e8c555431f2668b89573b2aa	yeah it happens. it's like watching mtv all week. fun but then it gets dull. just turn the channel.|`|2364b1c434c4e82c5a0f20b177935189aa	nope I have never lost interest in a gf (cause i like guys)|`|1203d31ab3bc3d0447a306d55a7bde5faa	Yup - that is called "boredom."|`|47dc79945d4cd8b4a89a64c1b83b18d0aa	You're probably bored. How long have you been dating? Do you still go on dates? Do new things? Try doing something spontaneous and exciting. Add crazy stuff to your sex life too. For example, tie a blindfold around each others eyes during the whole thing. It's intense.|`|0d871c1b24bf938caba19e4c164ff797aa	You answered your own question. You simply lost interest, and that is something that you couldn't help. Just don't string her on in hopes of not hurting her feelings. You would hurt her feelings alot more if you stayed when you don't want to.|`|98VPrkfMaa	maybe you haven't lost interest in her ,maybe you have just run out of things to talk about.  spruce up the sex life by watching alot of porn together. the good raunchy stuff.     maybe hang out with some Friends more and maybe become a little romantic once in a while.PSST!  (I heard they like that sort of thing!!)|`|b91c4389d410ce5bc4a5b14fe705a9fcaa	yepp.|`|a6a7b59d5d844480b6f34c5d0254c3a9aa	I know the feeling, the thrill is gone|`|aeb191e55af6a15a39067a4bc8fe50d6aa	yes its called realizing you are not compatible|`|c202df3d76a4fff25176b2b944d36b5faa	Yes I have totally gone through this before...    The thing is....     You have to wait it out because it is probably a phase.      I guess it is just like a Test to see if y'all are meant to be...    Samantha|`|AA12306514	perhaps she lost her edge. I don't know. women confuse me too. maybe you don't have as much in common with her as you thought.|`|e605f9887918d9cdd45aa7d875e2fc2daa	yes I have. you just need something new in life to do or you might just need a break from each other a while. like go on vacation alone. you got to spurce up the life with her or you will be feeling worse then you are now.|`|AA11953525	Hmmm... you know how I know you're gay??      j/k;p        I personally haven't had that happen to me but it's not unusual.  I think you should talk to her about it.  The best thing here is to let her know what you're thinking.....may be if she knows she'll try to surprise you with more exciting stuff.|`|BdOUl8pxaa	well i have hag that problem at lot it seems. See as a man It is natural for us not to want to be with just one person.You may feel like you still love her , but acully it is just the comfortable feeling of knowing her.Take my advise move on. you may get your interest back but you will lose it again and next time it will be more and cause you both more pain|`|d5880549f430ad6bada9c98bed624dcdaa	Sure it's natural. It's like eating hamburgers for dinner every night, after awhile you just get tired of hamburgers !|`|cf1da3aeb4bf0d074a2867f3a610bdc4aa	Why are you doing this to me? You couldn't just dump me to my face?!?! I love you! Don't leave me! Why?!?! ???|`|c55ad8d4581f170a068123089d42a803aa	It is quite normal to start seeing someone and without any warning, lose interest.  Sometimes, we don't know enough about the other person or even ourselves at the time when we started seeing each other.   And sometimes, body chemistry has a lot to do with it.   The best thing to do is just be honest about how you feel.  Waiting for a change to happen only makes things worse.    Next time, try getting to know the girl a little better before you make her your gf.  And yourself.   Know what it is you are looking for in a relationship and know exactly what it is that you like so much in your partner.
d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	It sounds Like MAry J Blige!

b5050af6348ebc55aabde293d337fc56aa	This advice goes by the assumption that you really are starting at bare bones........    If you're going to START building that kind of biz, start small at first. Find a band that's looking for some management. Get together some pics and other promo stuff like recordings and any news clippings on the band. Getting coverage is easy, start by getting the school paper(if you're still in school) to do a little writeup on the band. If not, try a local paper. They like to print stuff on young folks doing something positive. In Philly, they have 3 different mags that list bands and clubs and what they are doing week to week(one is a monthly) If there's mags like that in your area...USE THEM! Of course a website is helpful.    After you get this together, call some clubs. If you don't get the owner or booker at first, get a name! Then the next time you call, ask for the person by name. Whoever answers the phone will think you already know them and patch you right through.    NOW....before you call...KNOW what you're going to say! PRACTICE YOUR SCHPEEL! You can practice by asking someone to act like an owner so you can get your act down pat. If you know somebody in sales, that's a plus. They know how to work around intial rejection so you can get your band in. Because let's face it....you're trying to SELL the band.    After you get the band noticed in a few places and they get a decent following, try renting out a hall.    DON'T DO THIS IF YOUR BAND DOES NOT HAVE A FOLLOWING....YOU AND YOUR WALLET WILL DIE A MISERABLE DEATH     Hire a backup band. WHY? well....they might have a following too....and that brings in TWO groups of people buying tickets. NOW, since it's YOUR band running the show, YOU call the shots on things like how much they get paid to set length. To promote the show, call the papers(like the ones mentioned above), call the radio stations(don't forget college radio) and plaster posters anywhere that won't get you arrested. Tshirts and buttons can be made pretty cheap and that can be sold at a profit. PLUS, those people become walking billboards for the band with those same Tshirts and buttons.    Now, after you do all this and you show you can pull rabbits out of your butt...your name will get around. Bands will call YOU. So now, you'll have more talent to shop around. When the club owners see this, they'll be more likely to bring in your new acts....especially if you made the owners money.    I know all of this works because I DID IT. I've booked bands I played in along with 5 others for 10 years and all the bands had at LEAST two gigs a week. AND...the first concert I promoted drew in 500 people....the second over 1000.    This will definately make you a big player on the local level. If you need advice on a broader scale....you'll need to ask someone else....LOL    GOOD LUCK!|`|AA10410957	the best way to do it is to find a concert to promote and promote it. all you need is a band, a venue, and some solid advertising. its a lot of work and the money gets divided up between everybody. the venue has to be paid and the band has to be paid so if sales don't go your way, your the only one who really suffers. on the other hand, it is a lot of fun and you get out what you put in.

He's a coffee shop customer in Episode 14 of the 7th series, entitled "The One with Ross's Library Book".|`|8ZZb1Cm0aa	It was the episode entitled, the one with Ross' library book, and he was the coffee shop customer.|`|dd90cd032b19078a7d07f5a8981d5083aa	Ian thorpe is over-rated.|`|2e2066a38a7f1a40d9491a1556940bd1aa	Title: Ross' Library Book  Character: Coffee Shop Customer     He appeared in one episode in 2000

Marilyn was a class act, that's for sure.    Those of us who were adults at the time, believe that Marilyn was murdered by someone in the Kennedy circle. She had an affair with Jack, then Bobby, then she no longer served a purpose.    Another blonde who died tragically and young in an auto accident, was Jayne Mansfield. That one was awful and just too bad to write about. She also left a daughter behind, Marissa Hargitay.     Regardless of who she was, Anna was a 39 year old mother of a baby girl, and that in and of itself is a tragedy.|`|AA10989037	It's sad no matter who it is. She had a baby recently and lost a son.

0HHlReFPaa	That's what id like to know. The more I hear about her death and the paternity test the more weird the whole thing gets. I mean if Howard K. Stern is so determined that he is the father why doesn't he just take the test to get all of this over with. If you ask me I don't think any of the guys who have claimed to be the father are really the father. I think it's just a matter of them wanting to get her money. I mean because in most cases the guys are denying that they are the father. But these guys are saying they are. There's talk about the baby possibly being J Howard Marshalls kid. Apparently she had some frozen sperm of his. So if the kid is his then that baby is entitled to some of his money. Which means Anna really is smarter than she let off to be, and alot smarter than we all probably thought she was.|`|9a7e22e75485c85ed0b5ffc615dc051eaa	That baby is the splitting image of Larry Birkhead...

Howard is a first class looser weenie. Holding custody of a baby that isn't his is pure kidnapping.    I worry that if left with Howie that the baby won't be alive after the fight with the Marshalls is over.|`|d65a535f07c7b574b9c272c000e8c60caa	I honestly think that Howard K Stern was obsessed with Ana Nicole Smith, and since she is gone he wants to hold on to that baby for as long as he can. Once the paternity test does get done he will be kissing that baby good bye! I don't think that baby looks anything like him! I think that baby favors Larry Birkhead! BUT I FEEL SO BAD FOR THAT BABY!!! She is going to be put through HELL! The whole family situation is screwed up! The only one that is going to suffer is that little girl!|`|a4fddaf6a1e7cc689b0611f98a1c96acaa	Howard K.

So he may be alive still! I don't know about you but to me that's been done way too many times on this show & very reciently too. I always liked Zack, he was one of my favorites, but they are really making his charactor hard to believe lately. How about Kendal yesterday? Did you notice her fake accent would come & go. She seemed to have forgotten why they were in  Los Vegas too, she was having a great time & couldn't have been happier acting!

b5050af6348ebc55aabde293d337fc56aa	The easiest way to kill that BOING is kill the high overtones. All you have to do  is get some duct tape. Use one inch strips around the edge...preferably underneath. It sounds like you are using the white frost heads, they have a great sound except the overtones are a pain. After you get the head on, tune normally. That should cure your problem...and it's less expensive than buying more expensive heads    By the way...use a new head.....you just killed that one by stretching the heck out of it|`|3c61b805b73bc7faf2cf42702c94e159aa	Well there are several things that could be wrong. First the drum head could be to tight. Is the snare on or off when you tightened the head?Have you tried backing off the head and retightening using opposite sides in a clockwise pattern? What brand is the snare and the head. This could be the cause especially if the drum head is a cheap one. If you need more info let me know.|`|eh1mCXOfaa	It's not that your doing anything wrong in my opinion it's just that your looking for a fatter sound I take it. Right now your getting a ringing overtone right? To kill this a lot of drummers will use anything to dampen that sound like Duct tape or towels, or paper like you did, just enough to work. There are products such as Moon Gel that you can get at you favorite Drum store that will attach to either head, batter/resonant,  to cut the ring. Another approach would be to try a different head. Go with a 2 ply if your using only one ply now. If your a heavy hitter, Attack drum heads are used by some Metal drummers and Evans drum heads have a EC2 (edge control) model that might help. There are lots of options but loosening up the tension on both batter and snare head a little might be all you need to do. This is something all drummers deal with every time you put on a new head. You can also go to the modern drummer site, they should have tips there as well to help.
AA11608830	It was called salvage 1  and starred andy griffth from matlock and the andy griffith show.|`|TRLRsNwWaa	Yes, Yes, YES!!!    I loved it, it was called "Salvage 1" and was shown Thursday afternoons here in the UK.    I've searched for it for years, but it doesn't seem to have been released on DVD yet. I wish it was, it must have been about 25 years ago it was shown here. It's never been repeated either in my region at least.    I'd love to see it again - remember the engineers were fuels with hydrazine? and how they had problems getting some parts as they were not meant to be able to get them?

Both have the same sense of humor, both have a sort of amused discontent with their co-workers, both were in relationships they weren't happy with, and both had a secret crush on the other.      And even thought it was never stated, I am convinced Jim is the only reason Pam stayed in Scranton, just like Jim said she was the only reason he stayed and didn't take the job in Maryland

OKNSN6W2aa	THAT EPISODE LEFT ME SPEECHLESS!  Dan and Rachel Carr...shudder.  I hate Ms. Carr, I am SO glad Blair brought that loser down.  But the fact that Dan and Rachel are actually starting an affair is just gross.  Dan needs to go back to Serena, and Rachel Carr needs to go back to the dumpster where she belongs!  And Chuck...ooh.  I can't wait to see what group his dad was a part of.  As long as he never sees "Elle" again.  The most beautiful girl he's ever seen? That SHOULD be Blair!|`|jgs4VmVoaa	i hated her the moment i watch the first episode with her. she seemed iffy.  and now they REALLY ARE having an affair! it's so weird and gross!|`|40SxN3uGaa	I love D and S but their relationship WAS getting a bit boring, so having them break up for A WHILE (hopefully) is actually pretty good (in my opinion)     I was NOT the least bit surprised about Miss Carr just throwing herself at Dan and finally the hooking up part at the end. Wonder what's going to happen when Rachel finds out she was actually not fired after all...hmm.. totally gonna be awkward with Dan and Rachel, but I think we're going to see a few hook ups here and there, and maybe even on school grounds, so, you know, why not? S and D's relationship was pretty boring, so this could make things interesting, you know? :)|`|rJd1xvtYaa	D & S shld hv been over MONTHS AGO!

I am so glad that you asked this question. Dan used to be the really nice, cute guy (although I have to admit, he was so hot in that scene at the end of "Carnal Knowledge" holy smokes... I started getting chills and oh my gosh oh my gosh oh my gosh he was so AWESOME!) However, how can you resist Ms. Carr like that? I mean he obviously felt something for her, although poor guy couldn't help himself. I knew he was trying to control himself but failed. Anyway, it definitely makes the show more interesting. I don't approve of the two, but it leaves me on the edge of my seat. Guess we won't find out what happens next til March.... (ugh lol)    Oh and Chuck... GO BACK TO BLAIR ALREADY. But gosh Blair is worse now!|`|yXLtDhrxaa	It's just wrong although they both tried to control themselves before, but now that she 'was' fired it's a diff story. Dan just couldn't resist ms carr anymore, heck even I want to do her even if I'm gay!    Blair just got what she deserved though, she ought to learn her lessons sometimes, that pretty ?itch!    Serena... is it just me or does blake lively look a bit too old to play the role of a hs student? I like her though but it bothers me sometimes. and her and dan are major BORING.|`|MFFzk6HCaa	Omg!! I was completely gobsmacked! What is Dan thinking? Rachel is a nasty nasty woman, that is criminal! Can't wait to see what happens with chuck! Also when are we gonna find out more about the half brother?!|`|J4G58Rygaa	I like Ms Carr but i think Dan is an idiot for doing that!!! He's so "stick to the rules" that why would he hook up with some girl he barely knows! i like s and d together.|`|dMJTiNEsaa	I hate that stupid teacher too!!! what the hell is she thinking?! a student and a teacher? that is just sooooo WRONG.

KBBonf97aa	You definitely don't have to spend a lot to get a nice acoustic guitar.  If you haven't yet done so, you might want to have a look around the Musician's Friend website (musiciansfriend.com).  Epiphone, Ibanez and Jasmine by Takamine all make great guitars you can buy for less than $100.  It would probably be best if you went to a guitar store and played a bunch of different models, since each guitar has its own feel and some will feel more natural in your hands than others.  For a first guitar, you'll probably want to go with a thinner neck, since that makes it easier to fret the strings and move around quickly between chords.  Epiphone tends to have fatter necks than Ibanez and Jasmine, but the neck widths vary from model to model so you'll have a better idea if you actually handle the guitars.    If you find some models you like in the store, you can take notes and see if you can find them used on eBay or Craigs List.  It's actually a great time to buy a used guitar, since lots of musicians are having to sell gear to pay rent in the bad economy.    I think it's cool that you're going to play by ear and learn on your own.  I'm sure it won't take as long as you think to become proficient.  Just take your time in choosing a guitar and trust your instincts.  The more comfortable the guitar is to play, the more you'll want to play and the quicker you'll learn.  Good luck!|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Usually with guitars they are like cars, you want to test it before you buy it. ESPECIALLY if you want a specific sound. I say this because there is a difference in shape and wood that will change the sound of a guitar. So you know, Epiphone is Gibson's lower end stuff; meaning that items that didn't pass as a Gibson for some reason or has some sort of mechanical flaw that would set them apart from the better guitars, are labeled as Epiphone. My wife has a Gibson Custom and you can tell the difference in quality between it and an Epiphone. The lower quality one that I tested had a slightly duller sound than the Gibson but still is a good guitar.     If you want to buy online, then you really should Youtube the guitar you want to buy and see what others have said and also see a demo of the guitar to make sure it's the right sound. My wife did this for her Rickenbacker because there isn't a place near us that sells them. Youtube is an asset for musicians, either in lessons, reviews or demos. The nice thing is acoustics can go for pretty cheap compared to an electric. I got a Fender steel body for about $250 from Guitar Center a few years ago that has a great sound.       Hmm on type, I can't tell you what brand is best, that's based on personal preference. So you know there are two types of acoustics: acoustic-electric and then non electric. Non electric is just your basic acoustic but the acoustic-electric has a plug for playing out on an acoustic amp, which will make it sound like you miked up an acoustic. The nice thing is that you get two for one because the acoustic-electric doesn't have to be played electrically.|`|2EOCuLPKaa	I'm teaching myself as well. I have an acoustic Ibanez that's pretty good, but a little pricey. If you want something less expensive, I would check out Wal Mart. I'm not trying to be funny or anything but if you don't see yourself actually continuing and playing your guitar, what's the point of investing a bunch of money that's gonna collect dust right? The prices at Wal Mart would range from $70-150 tops. Either that or you can check out a local instrument shop like Guitar Center or whatever sells guitars. Ebay is a good option too....|`|Njzk6tjraa	try an ibanez or epiphone, but if this doesnt help try going to ebay thats where i got my guitar from, or guitarcenter.com. and def invest in some elixer strings or some d'addario's.
IsPZJjVzaa	"Comfortable" by Kristin Mainhart|`|Njzk6tjraa	dunno sounds pretty crappy though
zewRBWE7aa	There's no telling with that guy. He discarded an unreleased MBV album because it wasn't good enough, so I'm taking the wait-and-see approach on this one. In the meantime I'm listening to a fairly decent recording of the London show on 6/13/08.
lJEWuhThaa	I have never personally gone but have had many friends who have and from their stories it sounds like an unbelievable experience that they have recommended everyone to go to at least once in their life.  I don't remember the specifics on parking/eating/how much money to bring, but I know they divide the entire area up by goofy names.  Like the one year they had characters from Austin Powers along with characters from other movies/tv shows.  I think my one friend was camping in the Dr. Evil section or something like that.    I don't know when they announced it, but I just read this article today that has a lot of the artists that are performing.....    http://music.msn.com/music/article.aspx?...    You can also go to www.bonnaroo.com to see the full list, however it looks like they will be adding quiet a few more artists before June.
ygmlqaQPaa	"Family Guy Viewer Mail  1" segment: Super Griffins|`|oNv9UtKvaa	megs power is to grow nails lol|`|AA11402617	Season 3 episode 21     "Family Guy Viewer Mail  1"    Brian and Stewie host a special episode of Family Guy, featuring three non-canon stories created from viewer requests.    No Bones About It - A genie comes to Peter to grant him wishes; his last wish makes it so that he has no bones and must deal with life as a lump of lard.    Supergriffins - The Griffins are exposed to nuclear waste and gain superpowers, which lead them to terrorize the city.    Li'l Griffins - Tot-like versions of Peter and Quagmire try to out-brave each other in a haunted house to impress Lois in this Little Rascals parody.

I hope this helped!!!!!!
KYdg8tpUaa	I think he must be really dumb to do that,he is a public figure and he was pretty dumb to not think someone would snap a shot of him and sell it off to make a buck...you would think he would be smarter then that..and i hate hearing all these people keep saying thats what every 20 something is doing so its not big deal, well guess what it is..its illegal and im 25 and have never once smoked a cigarette much less pot..he is supposed to be a "role model"..he can say goodbye to that..|`|YJ4BFphTaa	I personally don't care, he's 23 and needs to live a little.  He's only human. Gosh.|`|h9ZqxS4Caa	I think he made a mistake. First of all, he is now a public figure that should pay attention to his actions in public. Second, he is a role model athlete to a lot of people out there and certainly smoking pot is not a good thing. By the way, I thought athletics don't/ shouldn't smoke because it affects their health and activity.     I was a fan of him but after that, I am not any more.|`|w12w811taa	yeaaaaaah michael phelps geeeet itttt 8)|`|qOKFuXfLaa	no, he's still ugly|`|k39bNUgeaa	why do you people keep posting stuff about this    All of you are making this a big deal when it isn't    Thousands of other people smoke pot  But since they are known aroun d the world no one cares|`|4t6iRWl0aa	I think he made a mistake...has everyone who smoked pot going through the same scrutiny that he is?  Yes, he is a role model, but I also believe by him coming clean and admitting to it, he is fixing his mistake.  He is showing people that he is a real person and does make mistakes, just like everyone else, but can also admit to them.
AA10374849	actually, they did not perform together. they performed one after the other during the grammys in 2003, with other artists, in this sequence:    1. vanessa carlton   2. john mayer   3. james taylor.    "Singer-songwriters Vanessa Carlton, John Mayer and James Taylor gave back-to-back performances, during which Mayer introduced Taylor as "the blueprint." Moments later, Mayer's "Your Body Is a Wonderland" beat out the title-track to James Taylor's "October Road" to claim the Best Male Pop Vocal Performance category."
O2hmjOPyaa	I actually can't say that any annoyed me to the point of being pissed off.

However, if you don't know them that well, I would suggest staying away from shirts of that theme. That is more of a hang with guys shirt than hang with girls shirt.    By the way, your photo links aren't working, so this just going on what I imagine the panty shirt looks like.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Both links don't work|`|SFZq3ullaa	ok it would not let me view the blue totoro shirt...    and i love totoro!  damn now i gotta watch it! lol    but i also love panties!!

SFZq3ullaa	YES!!   all dubbed anime is different...  the differences may be small but the dialogue has definitely been changed.. even if it is on Adult Swim  exampes: they may make a reference to some J-Pop culture and in the english version they changed it to an American Pop culture reference so the audience will know what they are talking about...  another example from wikipedia:  FUNimation's dubbing of "Shin Chan" takes many liberties with the source material. Since most episodes do not feature extensive continuity, FUNimation has chosen to take advantage of this by producing episodes of the series out of their original order. As a result, characters such as Ai are introduced much earlier than in the series' original Japanese run.    The FUNimation dub is adult-oriented, with many sexual references, dark humor, and references to current popular American culture, the latter of which makes the series appear to be set in the "present day" (2007), rather than in 1992 (the year the series was first broadcast in Japan). For example, in one scene, Ai and Penny argue over which one of them is Jessica Simpson (whose first album wasn't released until the late 90s) and which one is Ashlee Simpson (whose first album wasn't released until the mid-2000s), which is very different from the original Japanese script that dealt with many social issues within Japan at the time. At least two episodes reference Rudy Guliani and his unsuccessful bid for President.      i personally will not watch any anime in english.. not after watching Sailor Moon get ruined...|`|io4WrL0qaa	Unfortunately yes. usually all dubbed anime are a little different from the original manga and japanese anime. Its usually because FUNanime, the company that does the dubbing, is targeted at younger kids so mature stuff will be taken out of. (ie. sex, language, abuse...)    Like in the original One piece the blond cook Sanji is a serious smoker  but in the dubbed version he's sucking on lollipops.|`|uctxzjIIaa	The overall spirit is the same, but some parts are censored, and all the pop culture references were changed to things someone who doesn't live in Japan would understand.|`|MhowmBl9aa	That's a good question...I highly doubt it, because they really don't hide anything; it's just as profane as the Japanese version. Plus, it's on Adult Swim, so...

YkZeA3Jvaa	City slickers can't stand guns because they've got this crazy, mixed-up notion that guns are for killing only people.    Well, if you go to the politics section, you'll see an occasional question from the leftist "we're in a recession" panic mode crowd, who are desperate to point out that it's all going to get worse before it gets better, and what are we going to do when there's no food at our stores and in our restaurants?    I smile and answer them with statements like, if you can't pick up a rifle and go hunting, plant some corn in the ground out back and run a trotline in your local lake or tie a damn fly, then I guess you're going to go hungry, and us ignorit kuntry folk are gunna be yer daddies.|`|At7iKpONaa	As long as he has a shotgun, a rifle, and a four-wheel drive...lol.

AA11850427	Yes, I know about MTM, and yes I have Qwerty on my computer. Click the link I've put in the source section for a 30 second clip of the new single, "What I've Done"!!

Great i've been long waited for their comeback and i didn't knw that the newspaper report was true.    I can't wait. Where have they been man....    I go look for the song Qwerty, thanks for the early announcement!    I hope they'll be launching a world tour soon!  Boy the Oct 15 2003 LP Concert I had in KL was awesome!    By the way, Qwerty is the 6 consecutive letters on your keyboard next to tab. Who doesn't know that|`|AA10182154	No I had not heard that. Thanks for the update. Now where can I hear Qwerty, if you don't mind me asking?|`|cb2506453d76fc72a1b6ae7658796fd3aa	Yes, it is true! "Minutes to Midnight" released internationally May 14, but May 15 in the US. Their first single is titled "What I've Done" and will be released April 2. I know this isnt part of ur question, but i'll explain the name of the album and where they got it from. "Minutes to Midnight" is a reference to the Doomsday Clock[1], where "minutes to midnight" is a measure of the proximity of the world to nuclear destruction. I'll also explain the new single "What I've Done" to u. In an interview with MTV, Chester Bennington said that the song would be different from previous Linkin Park songs: "The drums are much more raw, the guitars are more raw and the vocals aren't tripled. Bennington also revealed the first line of the song: 'In this farewell, there is no blood, there is no alibi'.    I have heard Qwerty. It will not be on the new album, but it is still a good song.

It scares me. Sometimes, I get really upset and feel that the small things that I do to try to help aren't good enough and I get angry that the governments of the world aren't serious enough to care.|`|AA11981962	And which God would that be?|`|YdOiiL0Oaa	yes i do blacky but wat can we do we can't stop enjoying|`|54e916aded60cc8e33df79c397526446aa	Ok, I am atheist but I agree with the destroying bit.    Do not despair! There are people like you and me that do care. We just need to spread the word. Be a political agent. Inform people of what is really happening. Ensure everyone you know watches 'an inconvenient truth'. Be the change you want to see in the world. Do everything you can to make a difference. Change your light bulbs, install water tanks, install solar panels, donate to conservation foundations, take public transport. If enough people make change we will change the world we live in.    Edit: If we as voters kick up a big enough stink about global warming and conservation the governments will listen. Do you think that the governments wanted to listen to women about their right to vote? No, but they had to when women started protesting and carrying on about it. If we make it an issue, they will too. Nothing will change if we keep doing nothing about it!|`|950318e830dc1e91a28b2b2cb98303aeaa	There's only so much a person can do.  No point in feeling guilty over something you can't control.  I recycle, drive a fuel efficient subcompact car and try to conserve water and energy.  What else can one person do?  It's up to the governments of the world to convert from fuels that pollute to ones that don't.  Personally, I feel that as long as there is money to be made raping the Earth then it will continue no matter what we plebs do.

Sorry. Don't Have the faintest.      I'm in 4th Dimensional Natural Time.    Today is:   Blue Monkey.                                     (West, Water Endings.)                                    Tone 11 / Resolution    The energy coming from the Sun, and pervading the planet is Blue Monkey, Tone 11.    If today is your Birthday:    You would be Blue Monkey, Tone 11.    Monkey is known as the Weaver or the Weaver of Time.    Monkey takes ideas as threads or vines and weaves them into a fabric of our reality.    New patterns or inventions are also woven into our lives by Monkey.    Amiable, intelligent, generous and a jack of all trades,   monkey's innocent curiosity leads to artistic expression and constructive solutions.    Many Monkeys become highly respected merchants or speakers.    They love performing practical jokes and crave attention so much that they may over-act or play the fool to get the spotlight.    Monkeys have a short attention span and find it difficult to stay with anything long enough to master it.    A good day to:  Begin anything new in your life.      TONE 11:    Every new creation has to find it's space in the Universe.    In the process of "fitting in", some modifications must occur.    These changes are the Energy of 11.     11 is the energy of dynamic actions facilitating change, simplification and improvement.     To those born with this energy, some persons are put off by too much change.     Maybe you've noticed.    **************************************...  By the way, "Did you know there are 13 moons per year?"    Each moon has an intention.    4D time-   Where the future, past and present all exist at the same time.  (It's always now.)    Where time is art.    NOT TIME IS MONEY.    Why are we on a 2000 yr. old Roman tax calendar?    13 moons, but only 12 months?    Seems a bit fishy, eh?

JMKCg19Caa	It was Col. Fitts, because they showed a short clip of him with blood all over his t shirt after Lester was shot. I know this because I have the movie and have seen it enough times to know. I think Col Fitts. shot him because in that one scene where he tried to kiss Lester in the garage, he thought Lester was being gay with his son, and was so embarrassed about it, and also he blamed Lester for the big fight that he had with his son and kicked his son out of his house basically disowning him for thinking his son was being gay with Lester.   His wife was holding the gun while she was driving home because she intended to use it on Lester, because he caught her cheating on him with King Realastate guy, but when she came home and realized he was already shot by Col.

I think the wife was planning on maybe shooting him but then when she came home to him already dead, it really hit her that she was gonna do that, i think she got scared, but then, didnt have to do it herself.   Col. Fitts did it cuz he's a real hard-*** type guy and has even beat his son thinking he was gay, but in reality, he himself is gay and tried kissing Lester, and he couldn't handle that when he finally tries to do something about his homosexuality, he gets rejected and couldn't handle it and flipped like he always does and killed him.

968ul5Dvaa	I love Nevershoutnever! He's so talented and unique and I think he's probably one of the most original acts out there. He's 17, vegetarian, and adorable, what more could I want? AND he plays the uke. Even if you don't love him, there's no way a human being could HATE him. He's contagious. 
NY1SQ6N8aa	Uh NO, I think it's completely repulsive people do that, but now, hypocrisy seems to be more "in" in school. For example: Girls wearing slutty clothes and being all "RAH RAH" around guys, yet talking behind each others' backs about how the other girls are skanks/sluts. Dudes saying how they smoke a fat pound of grass everyday, then calling another guy "pothead"|`|AA11402528	i dont think of stuff being "cool"    little 13 year old sluts losing their virginitys gross and theyre retarded, i cant stand **** like that    but um yeah drinking and weeds fun|`|SLBsuflsaa	drinking and drug use is still very cool|`|PCoaSdM2aa	all of those thing would give you a bad rep|`|e00dff88dc30b4a7021797a2956952d6aa	I am NOT a teenager, but I still think drugs and promiscuity are wrong|`|hEFthejvaa	none of these are considered cool. as long as you're the type who doesn't try to be like others then it's all good with me.|`|tsmBfwm0aa	Well, none of these are really "cool." But I won't criticize those who do them. Its their decision. If someone does it just to be cool, they are dumb. Having fun is a different story...|`|WWjh1jxZaa	i think its more cool to be a virgin.    half the people i know aren't though.  drinking and drug use: i only see the guys doing those, but none the less they still do it.    i don't though.
16b912e4bd4d6f66ed2959a22f1ac3caaa	I agree that most teens think of country music as their parents or grandparents type of music. But I also feel like they prejudge country by what they have heard from older generations.    If they were forced to listen to alot of different types of country they would more than likely find something in there they would like.    More and more younger singers are coming into the country genre now. You have Kelli Pickler,Taylor Swift...etc.  I can't think of a girl who wouldn't like My red High Heels or Before he cheats if they would have the opportunity to listen.    So I guess in summation I would guess that ignorance to the music is your answer. If you never try apple juice, how can you say you don't like it?|`|uxU5lOLYaa	A lot of them do like it, they just won't admit it.|`|vGjxpHD9aa	Well I'm 15 and I like it . But then again I like most kinds of music . Teenagers these days are very narrow minded and they find country music kind of old fashioned I guess .    XxX|`|5ydqCVE2aa	It's slow tempo, mostly acoustic, and generally sung by middle aged men|`|2iWAPPd6aa	im not sure.  maybe its cuz of the stereotypes that come with it. if most people actually listened to it, they'd learn to love it. :D  i used to HATE country cuz i never actually listened to it. i just thought it was a genre of music where only rednecks belonged, but when i actually listened to it, i fell in love with it.|`|rRCTvT7Saa	Well, I've been listening to country since I was about 16 (about three years ago).  Honestly, I think country's great!  I mean, I think modern artists and classic artists are great--Chet Atkins, Brad Paisley, Jerry Reed, etc.    I think the main reason country isn't as big with teenagers is because of the topics of some songs.  In all truth, some country songs just have more mature-sounding lyrics, where all those rap "artists" don't and, instead, they basically make a joke out of songwriting.      Ryan is right.  I can't even remember half the times I've heard people make fun of country artists because they're country.  I've noticed that it's mainly the metal fans who are like, "Country guitar isn't cool.". The only thing I can say to those who think like that is, "You've obviously never heard of Brad Paisley who can not only outplay any rock guitarist in country, but can also outplay many rock guitarists in rock, blues, jazz, western swing, surf rock and bluegrass."|`|2k8TEiRtaa	To the younger generation, it is not cool. If you live in LA, NYC etc. But to us who live in the country it is just down home music. At least in my eyes.(ears)|`|OhBbwpPuaa	well it depends on where your from, in the midwest/south its popular, not so much on the west/east coast|`|d8JsGUlCaa	My guess would be that country is stereotyped as music for hicks and rednecks. There's also the stereotype that country is "your parent's music", therefore, it is "not cool". From what I see, most of teenagers who despise country do it as a way to rebel against their parents, a common adolescent behavior. Some may not like it for genuine reasons, such as not liking the way country singers sing, or how they play guitar. Fans of heavy metal may say that it's not "brutal" enough and is music for "wimps". Fans of rap or hip-hop may say that country doesn't have a "good beat".     Personally, I think there is great country music out there. Just like every other genre, there are country artists that are mediocre at best, and some that are overplayed.|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	I am not a teenager, but I think most country music is whiney.
YJ4BFphTaa	YES and I love Mamma Mia, Les Miserables, Miss Saigon, Showboat, The Phantom, Joesph and the Amazing Tech.

Our founding fathers based our voting on the electoral college so, technically, with Bush winning the electoral vote but not the popular vote in 2000, corrupt things can happen. Our democracy isn't really for the people, by the people because look at things like the Patriot Act. That would be against our natural constitution given right to free speech or to overthrow the government if we feel that it is corrupt. Our system has been corrupt for many years and will continue until we do something about it or the government just collapses.|`|H8XpaaPDaa	not really. that's only what the media propaganda tells you...    but if you look beyond the propaganda, you'll know that what you think doesn't matter.    look, no one wanted the iraq war for years, bush didn't stop it.

Can I have your autograph?    : )|`|NCMZy6Uqaa	I'd show him some Glenn Gould's recordings of his works and ask him "what do you think of using a modern piano? You think it works?"|`|CrAwmz65aa	1. Did it every occur to you that you would be remembered 300 years later?  Or were you betting on the world remembering the composers who were more prestigious during their lifetime?    2. Bach thinks everything you marked allegro should be played slower than most people play them.  But Landowska preferred a real blitzgrieg.  Which one is right?    3. In The Art of the Fugue, you wrote four staves, but you didn't write any names of instruments.  We can't play the whole thing with a string quartet because the tenor part goes too low for the viola.  What instrumentation do you want?    4. How do you feel about transcriptions of your music, such as the Bach-Gounod Ave Maria, the Bach-Wilhelmj Air on the G String, and the Stokowski orchestrations?    Above all, what do you think about this?  http://uk.youtube.com/watch?v=wyvL4Cexj1...|`|ThKkn5fKaa	My old car had a bumper sticker that said "Get off my Bach!"    Sorry.  The first guy started it.    Anyway, you could ask him why he thinks it took more than 100 years for people to really appreciate his music on the scale that it is appreciated today.  During his life, Bach wasn't as well known and respected as he is now.  His music was only really re-discovered with through the efforts of Felix Mendelssohn who was a big champion of Bach's music.  Why did it take so long for people to recognize his genius?  Were we just not ready for it during his life?|`|ZsxbOXtzaa	I'd have to ask him how he supported his 20 or so kids.    Why were sons more successful  than him.    Did he prefer the organ or harpsichord???    Shouldn't be hard to find more.|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	One which I think a lot of people would be interested in:    If you had had the opportunity, would you have liked to have written opera? If so, what subjects would have interested you? What would a Bach opera be like?    And another:    How many works DID you actually write, do you know? We believe many have been lost and we're fascinated about what we might be missing.    And lastly:    It is believed you tried-out an early piano towards the end of your life. What did you think of it? Are you surprised that it completely usurped the harpsichord as the keyboard instrument of choice?    Edit for Dr John:  I don't think there is any CONCLUSIVE proof one way or the other about the Toccata and Fugue in D minor. However, I agree that it would be a fascinating question for the blind old buffer.|`|obGQ2Bqfaa	Just how frustrating was it to work with those second-rate zippelfaggotists ?

I think I'll leave you to Handel these questions!    [Edit]: He he!

UyOlZomEaa	To answer your question, you local Coast to Coast AM affiliate is WFNC on 640am.  I do not live in NC and I never have.  I went on their website to relay this info to you.    I am a fan of the show and I have been listening for years.  I don't work late anymore so I do not really listen to it anymore.    The show has national coverage at night.  Its really a cool thing that happens.  Because of our beloved atmosphere layer we call the ionosphere, AM (doe not work with not FM) radio signals go up and bounce off into other markets.  Because Coast to Coast AM is on so many stations at night, it is almost impossible to not find a station at night on the dial with the show.  Its great when traveling long distances at night, like NJ to FL.  I am kind of disappointed it is now on XM.  It took the fun out of looking for a station.  Especially in NC.  Though you have a local station in Fayetteville, I bet you could switch around a little bit at night and get a Chicago station or somewhere else far away with the show.  I like to do it because I think its kinda cool.  Thats my opinion.

d4c9a4d52a9e77de4545721ac937c02faa	Yea! Just heard that like an hour ago. It was a little frightning, yet cool. He's such a bad@$$, lol. I love him in Batman.|`|Yg8gbxMraa	Serious? Umm, he's an actor, he's not looking for the a cure for cancer. The great actor Laurence Olivier said it best: "Dear boy, it's called acting." The guy messed up the scene, well ok, you are an actor, act again. He needs to calm the hell down bc his *** is already getting paid millions for just getting in front of a camera and saying his lines. He's not fighting in Iraq, he's not fighting fires, he's acting. No human being should be addressed the way that guy was by Bale. Methos actors swear their work is so "serious." Everything this celebrities have, they owe it to us, bc we buy their movies, cd's, etc...we pay for them to have the life that they have, they should have more respect.    Being a badass doesn't mean you have the right to treat people without respect.    This girl totally read my mind:  "I don't know who this douchebag thinks he is, but he needs to chill the hell out. Method actors, I swear! Jeez! Aren't you an actor? Don't you get paid to freakin act? So get out there and act again damnit! "Oh Oh! He interrupted my scene!" Try, "Oh Oh, I'm losing my house!" or "oh oh, I lost my business! My only source of income!" or "Oh oh! My car got repossed!" I know a lot of people think Bale is hot stuff and the cat's meow and a great actor, but I never liked this douchebag, I always thought he was "blah."    Somebody needs to kick him in the *** and maybe the stick that's up in there will fall."|`|CLIu5u82aa	Fact: Bale drops the F bomb 28 times.  Fact: He starts with calling Shane an ***, and ends with calling him an ***.  Fact: He also calls him a prick, an amateur, and "unbelievable."

K2bRW7XFaa	Well Ben went to be "judged" and the floor collapsed and Locke left to find something to pull him out but Ben just kept walking. He cam to a room and there were hieroglyphics everywhere. The smoke monster came out and surrounded Ben, showing him memories of ale (pushing her on a swing, telling Ben she hated him, getting shot.)  Ben starts crying and the smoke monster leaves. Then he turns around and sees Alex. He tells her he was sorry and it was all his fault. She said i know it is your fault. She then shoves him into a wall making him promise to do everything Locke tells him to do. Then he starts walking back, Locke asked what happened and he said it let me live.

AA11521395	Its the very first episode:    "Jan, Michael's boss from corporate, came by for a scheduled meeting. When she asked if he wanted to add something to the agenda she faxed that morning, Michael blamed Pam for not getting it to him. Jan then got down to the business at hand: Either his branch or the Stanford branch had to close. It didn't take long for rumors to spread about the possible downsizing. Pam didn't think it would be the worst thing if they let her go, 'cause she'd be able to pursue her dreams of being an illustrator. Dwight was also ready for the bloodletting to begin.Michael assembled the staff to tell them that either they or the Stanford branch would be downsized. He promised to go to bat for the office, and swore that he wouldn't let anyone lose their job.Jim made plans with Pam to have an end-of-week drink, but Roy, her fianc, put a stop to this. Jim invited Roy out with them, but he declined. An awkward moment followed when Pam left the two men on their own - it was obvious that Jim had a deep crush on her.Michael thought it would be funny to play a trick on Pam by telling her that he was fired for stealing Post-It Notes. When her crying got to be too much for him to take, Michael told her that she'd been tricked. According to Michael, it was a "morale-boosting" thing. "You're a jerk," Pam told him, but Michael didn't agree with this assessment."|`|AA12074189	The Pilot, is the very first episode of The Office. Most consider it as one of the worst episodes of the Office, for it almost goes word for word, for the British Office. It establishes the major plot for the next two seasons, that the Scranton branch might be downsized or closed. All of the characters are introduced. We also learn about Jim's pranks (puts Dwight's stapler in jello, a trick he used at the end of the episode on Michael's mug, and even late in Season 3 on Andy Bernard's calculator). We learn of Michael's inability to understand his that nobody in the office likes him.|`|AA11383431	piolot means first episode|`|Zr7eAkQQaa	The Pilot was the 1st one.  the "Pilot" episode.  it really wasn't about anything much.  we just got to know the characters a bit.  there was talk from episode 1 about the office closing, and Ryan came on as a temp.  Michael messes with pam by telling her she'd fired, then says she's been "Punk'd".|`|990134814ae0f1b3bac77a3e3426b96caa	The Pilot is always the first episode of a series. so it probably shows about the first day at work or people meeting each other or something like that.

e6795a5889aedcd8f2ba7d31a4432df8aa	actually there's been almost 2 yrs long of fillers for Naruto from episode 135 to 220.    I heard that its because the show was a hit back then and the producers wanna make more profits from on going viewers, they drag the show with fillers.    Since you're bored with these filllers, i recommend you to read the manga version (comic version), you can download these image files packed in winzip folder from many sites via google search. No drags, no fillers, all focused on the plot.    Or    Watch the new season called Naruto Shippudden. That's the end of all fillers and the beginning of Naruto again.    I stopped watching since episode 155+. And now I'm glad they have the all new Naruto Shippudden, i'm gonna pick up where i left off.    Watching animes from YouTube is much more convenient. Used to download my animes episode by episode and it almost fill up my second hard disk.|`|AA11141133	I go to YouTube every day! My accounting is "petranka"! I watch a lot of videos there! I watched Naruto there but i didn't stick to it because i didn't find anything interesting there! I suggest you stop watching it because it will kill your brain! Try watching "the 10th kingdom" or "the wolf's rain", etc....|`|TjJLBrm8aa	Well, it's probably really boring because they're fillers, a lot of episodes are fillers. It'll get boring once in a while but don't fret, it'll get way better...^_^'|`|OzMUSFAaaa	I think that the why the episodes of Naruto are getting a little cheap where you're watching it  is because maybe Kishimoto( The person who created Naruto) is probably trying to lead to somewhere big later. But it'll probably get better later on if you keep going. I hope I helped...|`|UFqSaGBPaa	episode 177 is part of the fillers, not the actual story, fillers were made so tat the second chronicle of the naruto manga could b continued, coz if dey just kept on going den the anime would have caught up to the manga, as manga as slower to produce then anime!  The parts u r watching r fillesr, made up episodes, now they started airing the second chronicle of the naruto story, the subbed version can be seen at youtube, dubbed 1s havent been released yet and wont be for another 3 or 4 months!|`|GnsSgrKUaa	You are in the black hole known as "filler".  These episodes aren't manga-based, and most of them are pretty idiotic ("Laughing Shino").    Do yourself a favor: skip right to Shippuden (episodes 221-224).  You will miss no plot details at all.    Shippuden is much better.  The characters are all more experienced, and Sasuke is back in the plot.    The filler is pointless.  It would be nice if the U.S. would just skip right to Shippuden [let's start a petition :) ].|`|a3lSm7U8aa	No i don't, as much as i love the show i wont watch it on you tube, i get tired of having to sift through peoples ametuer recordings that have them holding a camera in front of thier TV.  I am however in the process of getting the entire collection on DVD, im a nut for collecting anime and cartoon series,  It may have something to do with the fact you have been watching so many so close together as well.  When you sit and do something repeatedly for days on end it starts to get less interesting, say like answering yahoo questions eheh
e6795a5889aedcd8f2ba7d31a4432df8aa	The new season - Naruto Shippudden. Which is episode 221.    220 is the end of all fillers.    I skipped all of them and head straight to Naruto Shippuuden.    One more explanation for you.    During the period of fillers, the voice of Sasuke guy was probably away to cast for the voice of Ishida from Bleach.    That explains why he has been missing in action whole year long. This guy has 2 jobs.    Surprisingly Bleach is also a hit anime now, so vice versa, i do see the character Ishida goes on and off sometimes.    So now u can get a pattern, whenever Sasuke's missing, Ishida's on, and when Ishida's out of the limelight, Sasuke's back in the story.|`|3XASRw0xaa	Annoyin isnt it? r u watching the crappy 4 Kids version or the awsome Japanese eps that r dubbed in english and r downloadable? These r WAY beta. They have more action, violence, and make more sense.|`|UFqSaGBPaa	filers have ended rescuing sasuke part will come fairly soon in shippuden but first naruto hasd to go and help gaara coz he will be taken away by akatsuki!|`|GnsSgrKUaa	Episode 220 is the last filler.  Everything between then and Sasuke's betrayal is nonsense.  There is little character development, no plot, and Naruto learns barely any new moves.  The filler episodes are not even based on the manga.    Save some time.  Skip right to Shippuden.  Episode 225 comes out March 15 in Tokyo :).|`|xrxffM7Taa	when they FEEL like it|`|89541008cb74c86b7121232a1cb72cefaa	later sasuke fights orochimaru but i dont know if he wins i think he turns good because he just wants to kill his brother

696b011ccc8e4e395624e5f032666758aa	Say it Right is not a remake, it's something Nelly and Timbaland came up with together....All of her songs are written by her or with the help of other songwriters.    She is a Canadian singer-songwriter, instrumentalist and record producer.    "Say It Right" is a pop-R&B song written by Canadian singer Nelly Furtado, Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley and Nate "Danja" Hills for Furtado's third album Loose (2006).    The process of creating the song began in the recording studio one morning at around 4:00am, when Timbaland recommended that Furtado go home because she was tired. Furtado, who had heard that the band U2, one of her favorite artists,[citation needed] wrote many of their songs in the studio control room, said "Really? I'll show you", put on her hoodie and began to "jam".[2] Nate Hills and Timbaland soon joined her, writing and producing as they went, and according to Furtado this process intensified as she sang. The team used four microphones in the live room and moved them around during recording, about which Furtado said "...when you listen to it  there's a lot of dimension. It kind of sounds like [Timbaland]'s in another country".[2] Afterwards they picked the best vocals and "perfected" them, before inserting "reverbs and weird alien sounds" onto them. "[W]e experimented a lot with depth and different sounds", Furtado said of the making of the song. "[It] affected my vocals a whole lot."[2]  Furtado has cited the "spooky, keyboard-driven pop sound" of the band Eurythmics, particularly their song "Here Comes the Rain Again" (1983), as an influence on "Say It Right" and other tracks on Loose. "I'm not 100 percent sure what ["Here Comes the Rain Again"]'s about, but it always takes me away to another place, and I love it", she said.[3] She said that she does not really know what "Say It Right" is about, "but it captures the feeling I had when I wrote it, and it taps into this other sphere."[3] The song is written in F minor.  Billboard called the song "a Pussycat Dolls-inspired contempo jam, high on hooks and of-the-moment production. Well done, if in the most generic sense."[4]|`|8vyhc3sEaa	nope its an original of nelly furtado ! all her ! cool track too eh !|`|jvi5IzzSaa	no-it's all nelly and Timbaland    however, it's a great song!

The suit feeds off of hate and anger which it inflicts back upon its host. It also makes the user stronger and faster which appeals to Peter Parker in the beginning. Spiderman realizes that the suit is evil and beginning to control his life as well as ruin it. The only way to get the suit off is with ultrasonic sound waves, which weaken the suit but do not kill it. That is why he is standing in front of the huge bell when he is ripping it off.

856001476a4b6899b12659fb7ad5bcaeaa	Love do make the world go around. Make sure that your love is unselfish,demands nothing in lieu of it.that makes you close to the infinite, the almighty.It is the selfish love that makes all the problems in our life and in the entire world.Try to get rid of all the ambitions and just keep love for the world, all the living creatures. Don't get upset if the reaction from any corner is adverse and u still keep the love. U will finally find ur self and what ur attitude has contributed to u and the world at large.

I recommend Blockbuster online or another flat monthly fee rental program which will make renting tv-to-dvd movies quite cost-effective.|`|8c519b5ea62b53190c754f216378bec8aa	Seasons 1 + 2 are on DVD.

But if you're a big fan and you'll watch them often, I would just buy them. Season 2 especially has some good bonus features.

AA11257612	Windows Media Player doesn't have the ability to read the DVD; it piggybacks on a piece of software like WinDVD or PowerDVD or something. The other software does the decoding of the image and sound, WMP just puts it together on the screen.    In the process of putting everything back on your hard drive, you might have neglected the decoder software. If you haven't got an install disc for it around, you'll have to buy something online/in a story somewhere, as far as I know, at the moment there are no free options, other than to illegally download it.|`|8vyhc3sEaa	you need to get winDVD installed on ur pc...media player doesnt work dvd's on it.....so go out and buy the software .. its not all that expensive !and you will always be sure it'll work instead of downloading it illegally where u cant always know !

And every year Martha would say, "I know Stumpy, but that airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."     One year Stumpy and Martha went to the fair and Stumpy said, "Martha, I'm 71 years old. If I don't ride that airplane this year I may never get another chance."     Martha replied, "Stumpy, that there airplane ride costs ten dollars, and ten dollars is ten dollars."     The pilot overheard them and said, "Folks, I'll make you a deal, I'll take you both up for a ride. If you can stay quiet for the entire ride and not say one word, I won't charge you, but if you say one word it's ten dollars."     Stumpy and Martha agreed and up they went. The pilot did all kinds of twists and turns, rolls and dives, but not a word was heard. He did all his tricks over again, but still not a word. They landed and the pilot turned to Stumpy, "By golly, I did everything I could think of to get you to yell out, but you didn't."     Stumpy replied, "Well, I was gonna say something when Martha fell out, but ten dollars is ten dollars."     ...    A biker walks into a yuppie bar and shouts, All lawyers are a**holes!

J0bqxozSaa	one of them is Tareq Shrourou.    This song was created by two brothers from Florida. Lahme is Arabic for meat. Amusing, but unfortunately contains one solid section of misogyny all-too-typical of hip-hop music (and certainly much of Arab culture). Am I being too uptight when I say that? I wouldnt mind all the bitches and hos **** if there were equal strings of cusses for the opposite sex. Yet the thing is, there arent any insults that are as potent for the opposite sex Even bastard is just an ancient insult of ones mother.    Still, nice to see a couple of Arab-American kids being celebrated for doing something silly and fun, rather than being portrayed as scary potential enemies of the state.    You can find it on youtube.com

3e467dfc0a283431851d961cb213f69caa	Si. Al principio no lo notaba, pero despus de ver varias series de anime tambin me di cuenta de lo mismo,  que casi todos los personajes estn muy estereotipados por eso me dejo de gustar un poco el anime, llego un momento en que ya casi todo era pan con lo mismo y ahora ya no me pongo a bajar o a comprar cualquier cosa de anime, ya solo lo que de verdad me gusta.    Estereotipos hay muchsimos, como  dices, el (la) cara de palo, el callado, el inocente, el bobo, el pervertido, el tragn, el chistoso, el intil, el histerico, etc.   Pero no solo con los personajes, tambin en otras caractersticas, como por ejemplo: en un tro de chicas, fsicamente una debe ser normal, la otra sexy y la ultima un tanto ani?ada (como en Oh! My goddess, saber marionette y similares) o las series de haren donde hay un chico y la mayora del elenco es femenino y todas quieren con el protagnico aunque no sea un buen partido.    Hay pocas series donde un solo personaje muestre una gama ms amplia de emociones y reacciones como lo sera una persona en la vida real, generalmente siempre se encasillan en su "caracteristica principal", pero ?pues que se le va a hacer?, con todo y eso hay muchas series muy buenas.    &|`|IXZW0etoaa	verdaderamente yo prefiero los animes como los caballeros del zodiaco o dragon ball Z :p salu2|`|NfFEBcbHaa	Bueno a mi me gusta el shojo, y la protagonista estereotipada de shojo es siempre como, por tomar un ejemplo, Thoru Honda, de la serie Fruits Basket. Entre sus caracteristicas... Thoru se sobrepone a cirscunstancias inimaginables (vive en una carpa en el bosque!!!) siempre con una sonrisa adelante (filosofia del Daijobu). Este es un estilo muy optimista y muy marcadamente de shojo. Esta clase de optimismo crea una persona muy amable y agradable con todos y para los demas, pero que carece de sentimientos hacia si misma. La chica ideal de todo Shojo (y en general de todas las imagenes femeninas idealizadas a lo largo del arte), tienen mucho de martir, ya que viven enteramente para los demas. A veces parece que esto solo pone a la mujer en "funcion" del hombre, acercandose mucho a una realidad machista... (=S)    Bueno, este tipo de personajes se repite en algunos shojo. Ahora, un ejemplo que rompe mucho con este estereotipo, a mi parecer, seria Haruhi Fujioka, de la serie Ouran Koukou Host Club (los que hayan visto la serie me comprenderan =P)    Bueno... el shojo es de lo que mas domino y bueno ahi tienen =P|`|7G4WGGWfaa	En casi cada anime (y no me digan que no es cierto) hay un rival del protagonista.    Este "rival" esta siempre serio, tiene muchisimo porte y mucha ms maestra que el protagonista    Como que nada le afecta y es un sentimental en el closet  (como sasuke o picoro o el que sea)|`|XYPHXZsbaa	Para mi es el del tipico "Loser" que se enamora de una verdadera belleza".

Also it comes on USA a couple of times so you can go online a check their movie schedule.|`|AA11227706	Sometimes it's on channel 39 (fox family).  Renting it is a good idea too.|`|7joaYotoaa	You could go rent it from your local block buster. Or both those movies are often on the disney channel!|`|nD6745JWaa	Since illegally downloading movies is a felony. It's known as "Aiding and Abetting" and makes anyone who answers your question a felon as well.    You want a movie, go buy it or learn to live without.     You are being a pirate by doing this!     What you want is illegal and against the law! Can you afford a quarter of a million dollars fine or 5 years in jail or both if you get caught? Movies,Software ,Music etc are "Intellectual Property" which means that the makers/producers etc can fine you a lot of money|`|AA10147998	Is there something wrong with renting it?

45eZxejSaa	I think that violence is 20 times worse than sex and sex is 20 times worse than foul language. Most movies have that basacward!! the Passion of the Christ was less violent that Lord of the Rings! It is more acceptable to see female nudity I think it is a double standard. It's probably that way because women are more attractive then men! 2 or 3 f-words make an instant R rating.|`|987e74be97a10a494830a7c473b7c8b0aa	i think the MPAA ratings are alright. some movies i think are over rated and the rating could be lower but besides that i pretty much agree with them.|`|2bb80cbb696b9c3a325b273011788c38aa	there was a movie that was supposed to come out last year called "this film is not yet rated" which blew the lid off of this topic, and how its a bit of a conspiracy.   they gave it an NC-17 rating to keep it from getting to the public,   I personally think that it is pretty good, but there are certain examples such as this, that we need to look into and try to do something about this all, because it isnt fair.  i suggest you look the film up and see how it makes you feel about it.|`|8ab1eb38801c73cb34fca95faf1baa3daa	i think they are too strict. some movies get pg-13 ratings that really should be pg.    Also, i hate there descriptions of why it is rated r, or pg, or whatever. sometimes it says nudity and there is none. sometimes it says strong violence and ther is barely any

Otra cosa, que le guste un chico no es pecado, no tiene que confesarle nada al cura.  Lo que puede hacer tu amiga es ver como se llama el actor y buscar todo lo referente a su vida en Internet, y si ha hecho ms pelculas y que papel interpret en ellas y as lo ver de manera diferente a la de cura.  Besitos|`|24a16826e90dbd81357b442f7ba2cd2aaa	No es pecado. Tu amiga est enamorada de un actor que hace de cura en una serie.

No confundis la ficcin de la tele con la vida real. No veo el motivo por el que tenga que confesar que est enamorada de un actor de la tele.

An attendant greets him in typical Irish manner, unaware who the golf pro is, "Top o' the morning to ya".   As Tiger gets out of the car, two tees fall out of his pocket. "So what are those things my, son?" asks the attendant.  "They're called tees," replied Tiger.  "And what would ya be usin 'em for, now?" inquired the Irishman.  "Well, they're for resting my balls on when I drive," replies Tiger.  "Aw, Jaysus, Mary an' Joseph!" exclaimed the Irish attendant. "Those fellas working for BMW think of everything!"

Maybe she should be the next bachelorette. I like Melissa and Naomi at this point. I kinda like Molly, wouldn't be mad if she won but haven't saw much a personality from her. I mean if they did get it on in the tent then that would sting a little for her to get dumped. But you have to think. When they are down to 3, I think the bachelor gets busy with 3 different girls on 3 different nights. Wouldnt it be crazy if he dumped one and then one ended up pregnant... opps!

I think twins singing a duo would be hilarious and well received.    if your 13, there is a bit of cursing you may want to edit out, but i think it would be good.

3Bk0xbeUaa	if you wrote this song to get into some girls pants... my hat is off to you... i think it will work perfectly   if you are seriously looking at songwriting on a popular music level i would evaluate the lines:     And in the end, when day turns to dusk,  I know youll be there, and this I can trust     rhyming "dusk" and "trust" sounds too forced (especially to have the lines twice in the song) the last line is too mixed up and honestly sounds like yoda is singing     Best advice try a rewrite to something like:    when days turn to dusk in the end  i know you'll be there my beautiful friend    it sounds more sappy but b*tches want love and friendship in a relationship and music is created in some sense to help people escape the real world|`|2YWf9A6Baa	Pretty Good but it depends wat the music is and who is singing it and all but its very touching and all i like seriously but do you have the music for it|`|gSS0tKvmaa	these are really good...there exactly the type of music i normally listen to...if you ever get them into song form can you send them to me?|`|ZbEF9KoXaa	do u write potery then turn it into a song? caust that is what it looks like! i love it! i wrote songs myself just take a look at my questions and you can see a few!|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	the top makes me think of the beach!

AA12025213	To bend a note on a guitar, just push or pull the string vertically on the fret board with your fingers. This is easier if you get 2 or 3 fingers on the string, and then push/pull it. Try to keep the guitar steady, and let only the string move and stretch.     Good Luck!|`|5b3CJ0dBaa	You push the strings so that they bend and when you play the string.     check out this video http://youtube.com/watch?v=GsldbstYEog for help|`|bZud91iuaa	It's also known as "crying"  You do it by pushing the string up or pulling back on the string and raising the note, with your fingers.  You get the crying effect which for rock and blues guitar is desireable. The higher up the fingerboard the easier it is to do this.

xNEhI9XOaa	I used to use Noteworthy Composer when it was free.  It could convert midi to sheet music.    The best software is Sibelius but it costs.  For best reviews check out  http://music-notation-software-review.to...|`|AA12025213	There are programs to do this, I used to have a bunch of them. I don't remember what they were though.    Your best bet is to look up 'MIDI converter' on Google, then see if you can find a program that converts MIDI to notation, then find your favorite songs in MIDI form.    The reason is that a computer can actually read MIDI. Pitch recognition software is extremely shoddy, especially with Mp3's because there are so many things going on at once. When I used the software, I couldn't get one song to work properly.    MIDI files are extremely easy to find, so good luck!

CzYbvApraa	its on showtime.  and they show nipples, and i dont think they show bush. atleast not during sex. their ussually just skinny dipping in bettes pool if their super naked. thereve been guys peniss on the show. they show sex scenes, but its not really like a porno.they dont have super long sex scenes. its not so you get off. well maybe if yr kinda wierd...  its not porno, just,.. lettin you see.
Uelz8mldaa	Does it matter? Not even God can make this band sound good.

Although 50 cent kinda duz in Piggy Bank "2pac dont pretend"      Idk y they would tho, coz erry1 has respect 4 Biggie and Pac|`|OZjlW5utaa	Respect comes with death and they were some of the most respected and its enough disrespect to talk bad of anyone whos dead, so of course 2pac & Biggie and the other two on my left...  |`|ioNTTqKfaa	Why would they be that disrespectful towards a dead rapper? You're right though. Even the rappers who didn't like them when they were alive give props to them now.|`|q4XUy0Duaa	I would personally shoot you in the face for talking sh*t about Big.  You can say whatever you want about Pac though.    Nah, in all seriousness, I don't think it's cool to talk sh*t about dead people in general.
q4XUy0Duaa	^^^^Why would you answer this question?    17th all time    Muggs is sick!  He's been doin' his thing for years, and most people don't even know who he is.  He's the best producer in the West (better than Dre), even if he's from the East.  Dre actually got the G-Funk sound from Muggs on Cypress Hill's first album in '91.  In addition to the artists you've mentioned, he's also put out full albums under the Soul Assassins name, and with Psycho Realm, Sick Jacken and Planet Asia.  One of the best, in my opinion.|`|eFXD3Qzcaa	Sorry, I don't know what I'm talking about before I answer.  All I can answer is that I don't know who DJ Muggs is.  And I don't know who Cypress Hill, KRS, RZA, GZA, Dr. Dre, Kool G are at all.  To each his own, definitly not mine.    Sorry for completely going against your question.|`|Xi5eJGKGaa	Muggs is a top 5 producer in my opinion....He makes some really "eerie" sounding beats which in my opinion is why hes so dope.    these are some sick *** beats!!!    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tesD7inx8...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DcyOFMKqf...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vdNhAGA2...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CE1CHJn_Y...|`|bribxhsdaa	He's out of the top ranking of people who aren't beat junkies. If you're a beat junkie/knowledgeable about producers, You'll know who he is and how dope he is.    If you value bass and eerieness in your beats, Muggs is your goat with ease. Plus, Muggs doesn't exactly fit into the mould of West Coast Producers which is where (ideally) his fanbase should lie. Plus he pioneered what i call "The RE-Low end theory".. The way he EQ's the bass is a method in itself.    Muggs is in my top 10 easily.    My top 10 (It changes around what i'm valuing in beats at the time but for now its:    J-Dilla  9th Wonder  Primo  Madlib  Pete Rock  Muggs  Hi-Tek  Marley Marl  Rick Rubin  ?uest Love    The reason he's not in everyone's top is also because he's not PARTICULARLY universal...Like if you're not into that kinda RZA kinda style or Cypress Hill, You probably won't value him much. But he's definitely one of the illest of all time.    "I ain't going out like that" (Black Sunday - Cypress Hill) is one of the illest basslines of all time. - www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1b3uTa2foc (Great use of the RE-Low end theory)    And "The Foundation" (At The Speed Of Life - Xzibit) is one of the best uses of piano melody of all time too.  www.youtube.com/watch?v=4s3yQBgiQaY

fd3969820c20a4244842f433a5e6eee6aa	I was really bothered that they changed Pete's power too. I hate it, actually. The way his power worked in the first half of the first season is the only time it ever made sense to me. And according to those episodes, Pete should have automatically become the single most powerful person on the plane and he really should have been able to do anything he wanted. I hope they explain why he had to grab people and why they had to use special effects. Also, I hope we know why Mohinder and Tracy get to keep their powers even if Pete stole them. .    I am almost positive that Arthur is dead for real this time. But your theory is interesting because last night I thought how strange it is that Nathan is acting exactly like he did in Five Years Gone. But since Nathan cannot wind up being Sylar and since he and Sylar aren't related so it can be blamed on bad genes then Nathan's sudden, inexplicable change of character just makes no sense.     The only thing that was consistent on this show is that Claire stupidly won't do what she is told and Pete keeps almost getting everyone killed and is basically more trouble then he's worth.     The only idea I have about the plot is that if they don't call back the paintings of the planet exploding I am going to go ballistic. Why does the Earth spilt in half?|`|tUMqnycDaa	Going off of your first theory    I think Peter has the mimicry in a different way. He can get their power if he touches them and only for a short while. If you noticed, he touched Mohinder and got the super strength and then he got his butt handed to him. He might have lost the strength. Then he fell over and touched Tracy's hand and froze the plane wall. Just a theory. Guess we'll find out soon.    Other than that you pretty much covered everything running through my head.|`|mf2aSyB8aa	I don't really know whats going to happen BUT its kind of getting a bit like lost lol plane crashing etc lol. Anyhow i was annoyed that they didn't show how sylar came back to life. Though it was funny when they were trying to capture him i was like yh right lol :P I was also annoyed because claire looks like an adult and she isn't meant to.     RIGHT MY THEORIES!!!  You when nathan gave up claire and put her in the car. I think that the hunter dude was really annoyed and i  think that he is going to turn is back on nathan, because he thinks nathan is too weak.    I do think Arthur is defiantly dead but then you never know. However i want to know more about Matt's new power thing anyone know why he can draw the future lol.     ummm when i think of some more i will tell you lol :)

e8o2eP6Zaa	No! That'd be the best thing to ever happen. We could just chat about anime and manga all day!

I find that I don't push myself hard enough, I don't put as much effort into my workout when I am distracted.

FnxgmknUaa	Haha thats so weird since just today (not that long ago actually) my friend turned to me and said "You Are Strange". And i am proud of it ...    > You sound like me. Shyness isnt really us, you agree? Its really just our mask that we put on everyday to face the world with. I have few friends also, and like being alone. I really do enjoy solitude. The thing with "shy" people is that you can know them for years but never really KNOW them, however much you think you do. I  think they have a different way of thinking, and people couldnt be bothered to understand it, therefore they label them "strange" and avoid them. I think you get what im talking about ?     lol sorry to ramble but yea, just needed to express my opinions on something that i understand so well ...|`|CmJwqeJ5aa	I'm very strange i strive to be different... alot of peoples think i'm strange but that's part of my charm.....    especially when i say noon 30 or noon 45 when refering to the time...   between noon 01 and noon 59 thats how i call the time|`|EWTEUoZfaa	YES    I am different, especially my hair(not emo, just weird)...  also, it seems that i'm weird because i haven't had sex, or for that case any physical contact at all(i am a guy and 17)|`|89FgPZ9Waa	Not at all..|`|pNUtnoC8aa	When I was younger, about 3 years ago I was considered strange.|`|991409e2f8815e4e8a645dd82791db41aa	they do  I do  I am|`|842e7245d92a9eaaf5883492a9c11008aa	no, but they did in high school because i didn't want to be popular like some of the other girls. i wanted to be different and stand out.|`|e28P8gWraa	Yes. And no. I think Im weird.    I mean look! I made my pic look like a gay pirate!|`|AA12383908	So far nobody has told me. Maybe they whisper behind my back.|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	Frequently. Mostly because I own snakes/lots of different pets.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	i am strange for sure. I don't shake hands with people I know....not even my dad's friends. I like to keep my distance from people. I don't like people who are constantly clearing their noses. I don't like people touching me in any way|`|TWGWMe5Daa	They do  I do   We all do  Stay classy!|`|gJzSlKwGaa	yes i think i'm quite strange and i'm sure a lot of people think i am too.|`|174hHTXDaa	I am lonely also and I am used to people thinking that I am weird.|`|QQbbReRAaa	Yeah, I've heard that. But I like to be different|`|ySpHcjNkaa	No.|`|zzivfC0qaa	People when they first see me think I speak Urdu and English with an accent.|`|ADtfT5L3aa	well... sometimes... occationally! :)|`|JO8FKDRhaa	yes i imagine they do. and yes i think i am strange|`|rgP0rJaNaa	Absolutely|`|8sMuQa7haa	Faces look ugly when you're alone ...|`|UsojaTuuaa	yeah i know people think i am strange sometimes.  i think i am strange about certain things.  i think everyone is strange about something and everyone is weird in their own way.|`|MA3KcLUJaa	Yeah.   Sometimes Imake weird gurggling type noises, or start singing the power ranger theme song.  And sometimes Im just silent and people thnk that is strange too for some reason...|`|48f16lTJaa	Very.     But I think it's mostly cause I like to be different.|`|MyVtwtOnaa	yeah people think i'm very weird..but in a good way|`|NNki7qiFaa	Yes, sometimes.  I believe I'm strange.. and I like it.|`|ESmMSZdHaa	Strange, no.  Different, yes|`|3XMOrE4Haa	Yes.  But I'm proud of it! ^_^    I'M UNIQUE!!! Hehe!

Some people complain about spending money on Valentine's day,but I honestly would LOVE TO! I haven't had a gf on V-day in YEARS!     I don't think they're mocking singles so much as they're marketing a day to celebrate the together thing.They have trouble marketing heart balloons and awful boxed candy for anniversaries,because everyone's is different.V-day is a way to box all of the anniversary spending into ONE day,so they know when to start selling the stuffed teddies and candy hearts. They're not mocking us,they just don't care.|`|udQDahPTaa	no dear, it's when the single people watch couples make an a** out of them selves..wink... Dameon..

Not so for:Everybody Loves Raymond"  Marie was insulting, overbearing, opinionated and a pain in the neck and she never was cured of those traits, or even really made to feel sorry for the way she treated people, not in 9 years, she just kept on being that way.  Ray was lazy and only wanted to do three things and in this order, watch sports on TV, play golf, and have sex.  What a guy eh?  No matter how many times he got called on his shortcomings he never changed. He was actually kind of dumb and didn't care.  Not a likable character.|`|WyxxDgSeaa	Creative, imaginative writing, terrific acting teamwork, very funny Seinfeld!|`|6vzpHTqQaa	Seinfeld is better    -More memorable episodes  -More memorable quotes  -Marie coming over to your house from across the street every day can get really annoying rather quickly|`|0dWecYJFaa	raymond a little better than seinfeld|`|pddwVjALaa	I like both.

h3ENq8zVaa	I am a Cancer girl. Well, as you see, Cancers often changes their mood very quickly. No offense but most of the signs get annoyed by this, so only your own kind can understand you well. I have experience relationship with a Taurus, an Aries, a Pisces, a Aquarius and a Cancer as well.    With Taurus:  It was quite great at first, but not until now. He is too cold and mean. Cancers need to be loved and feel the sense of security. He likes to flirt and he always ignore me. I felt very unsecured with him.     With Aries:  We get along quite well for the first few weeks, but the flames soon burn out. He is very popular among girls. And when someone treats him well, he just hang out with the person and ignore me too. Now, he doesn't even remember my name!    With Pisces:  Quite good. Just that they are not as sensitive as you, they would sometimes hurt you with some of their words, but always came back apologising. But, they are one of your best matches and they can understand you very well. Excellent match    With Aquarius:  I am currently in a relationship with an Aquarius. They are quite good just that sometimes, they would be come slightly overboard when they are playing or talking with you. If you are not that sensitive, Aquarius will be a very good match.    With Cancer:  This is so far the best relationship I have ever had. Being with a Cancer is just like a mirror. He understands you perfectly and you do too. He won't say insulting words to hurt you. Even if he did, he didn't mean it. It's just so perfect being with another Cancer|`|6f1dc43e412ce9bfb8172810c9909704aa	Well, out of the signs that you've listed above,  it's mainly Pisces that best matches with Cancer.  Also, another match for Cancer (probably an even better  one, still !) would be a Scorpio male.     Yes, as you've also stated above, Scorpio males (especially)  can be quite headstrong, serious, & extremely intense.  But, underneath it all, they really do care for the one(s) they love.|`|KXs7Q4Xnaa	Leo 30%  Taurus 100%  Libra 70%  Aquarius 0%  Capricorn 80%  Pisces 50% to 100%|`|1rLqqi4waa	Ah, Cancer's search for true love continues.  Ok, so personally here's what I've got.    I love Leos too, but I can find their need of spotlight and attention to be exhausting at times.  However, I don't think they're self centered.  When treated right, Leos will give you the same royal treatment they demand from you.  I'm highly attracted to them, and they to me, but I find their intensity draining.      Taurus....lol.  Let me just say, they're hard for me to understand.  They think as long as you know they love you, they don't have to show or say it anymore.  I find that I always feel neglected and lost with a Taurus.    Libras are wonderful though!  My best friend is a Virbra, lol.  Right on the cusp and we get along wonderfully.  I have had a few Libra flings, but I can never really stay with a Libra because I find them so lazy! Lol. If they can get it from you, they don't want to get it for themselves. It's a shame.    I have had only one experience with an Aquarius individual, and while sparks flew, he was in a relationship with a pregnant girlfriend, yet saw no problem trying to be with me too.  I swear those guys are seriously detached from what's ethical.    Capricorn individuals are really cool to be around I think.  I find Capricorns somewhat boring, but everything else is there.      I have amazing chemistry with Pisces individuals.  My favorite Pisces we just sort of clicked.  I've never met anyone like him.  He's funny, he understands me, he's sexy and he's completely in tune with my emotions.    But at the end of the day, I have to go with Leo.  My Venus is in Leo and I just feel so amazingly well loved with Leo individuals.  As long as I let my Leo roam free to get all the love Leo needs, my lion always comes back purring.      ^_^ Good luck fellow moon child!|`|AwAw0uiKaa	I have found that Virgos and Cancers go well together, but that's personal observation. They are both very nurturing and emotional (in the good way), but Virgos tend to be nit-picky. I dunno. That's my guess...|`|7a00982533df23b16bd49972811d5b7faa	I am a moon child myself=). 6/30    My experience has been that a lot of times people don't fit their horoscope too closely because of how they were raised, or how they have developed themselves but there are some similarities.     My favorite signs seem to be Pisces. Very sweet, very attentive. Other Cancers are cool, but they are too analytical when paired with me. I've really liked a FEW Leos but they are so true to the sign... want the spotlight too much and that turns me off.     I am now in a beautiful.... I mean fills my soul with wonder kind of relationship... with a Capricorn. In our fourth year and the love grows deeper with each. Caps are everything that Cancers aren't.. the exact opposite in poles but it compliments me so well to get the perspective and learn from it. This has been the most challenging, yet rewarding thing I've ever done.|`|bpFacWHRaa	I'm a cancer and for some reason I ended up with a Libra. We are pretty perfect for each other...I mean we like the same music, foods, dress type and also agree on a lot of things so I would say give a Libra a try..I've been with some other signs and they weren't anywhere near a cool as being with my Libra so ya..give it a shot..I did :D  p.s.

Let's make some music, make some money, find some models for wives.  I'll move to Paris, shoot some heroin, and **** with the stars.  You man the island and the cocaine and the elegant cars.    This is our decision, to live fast and die young.  We've got the vision, now let's have some fun.  Yeah, it's overwhelming, but what else can we do.  Get jobs in offices, and wake up for the morning commute.    Forget about our mothers and our friends  We're fated to pretend  To pretend  We're fated to pretend  To pretend    I'll miss the playgrounds and the animals and digging up worms  I'll miss the comfort of my mother and the weight of the world  I'll miss my sister, miss my father, miss my dog and my home  Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom and the time spent alone.    There's really nothing, nothing we can do  Love must be forgotten, life can always start up anew.  The models will have children, we'll get a divorce  We'll find some more models, everything must run it's course.

xMhWrvheaa	No lo se, supongo que porque si todos llevaramos los dos apellidos imaginate que de generacion en generacion terminariamos con 500 apellidos cada uno...  Por que no llevar el apellido materno en lugar del paterno?  La realidad es que si queres a partir de los 18 a?os podes cambiarte el apellido de tu padre por el de tu madre y cuando nos casamos las mujeres optamos por mantener nuestro apellido, cambiarlo por el de nuestro conyuge o agregar el de nuestro conyuge.  Supongo que es simplemente por una cuestion de costumbre teniendo tantas posibilidades a nuestro alcance seguir llevando el apellido materno, la realidad es que tenemos la libertad y opcion de cambiarlo pero no lo hacemos.|`|mJd7lXcZaa	es asi. no por el sentido de ser machista.  siempre fue asi.      saludos..|`|729c42c8f7b0ca4f1f794a55a19916aaaa	La verdad que tu pregunta esta buena.Yo muchas veces me pregunto lo mismo.  Espero que otra persona sepa que responder   suerte|`|f16qbNv0aa	T puedes poner perfectamente primero el apellido de tu mujer a tu hijo y luego el tuyo, es cuestin de inscribirle as, hace mucho que est permitido, pero antes la sociedad era muy machista y haba un gran patriarcado as que el apellido slo era una prueba ms  En cuanto a lo otro de que la mujer adopta el apellido del hombre, eso es en Amrica, en Espa?a no ocurre en los documentos oficiales|`|aiwrRcQYaa	En Espa?a no es as, yo llevo cuatro a?os casada y conservo mis apellidos.  Eso s, cuando tienes hijos normalmente el primer apellido es el del padre, pero hace unos a?os que se pueden intercambiar y poner primero el de la madre.|`|ddfbea293e9581a80c3c5f7eebb88348aa	Creo que en Suecia se puede optar, sobre todo cuando el apellido del hombre es un apellido muy repetido. All casi todos son Johanson o Karlson o Gustavson...hijo de Johan, Karl o Gustav. Averiguar un poco ms porque me interesa. Hay paises donde las personas toman los dos apellidos, claro que el de la madre viene despus y se pierde en la siguiente generacin. Creo que hay algo muy fuerte an en la sociedad relacionado con el hecho de que tener el apellido del padre implica no ser hijo de padre desconocido. Esto est cambiando porque hay muchas madres solteras por decisin. Es absurdo llevar el apellido de una persona que le da lo mismo que existas o no. Son temas que hay que debatir cada tanto para que la sociedad tome conciencia de tantos absurdos que aceptamos sin analizar su contenido.  Buena pregunta.|`|w1d997uEaa	La iglesia interpreta la biblia como quiere, y la gente ya se acostumbro a eso, asi que es muy dificil cambiarlo...|`|dI5MdrG5aa	Desde hace varios a?os, en Espa?a, se puede invertir el orden de los apellidos en el Registro Civil. Si, por ejemplo, al tener un hijo. se quiere poner el apellido de la madre, pues se puede hacer y as perdurar el mismo.|`|2e85ba9264c1668561b674bfcba9c263aa	Solo se trata de cosas legales, algn da eso tiene que cambiar y dejarlo a decisin personal .|`|IXZW0etoaa	es una costumbre que se ha hecho y ahora es dificil de cambiarla, ademas no creo que afecte a nadie esto, ya que durante miles de a?os se ha hecho asi y nadie ha muerto por eso, mas si mi mujer quisiera que yo tomara su apellido lo podriamos hacer ya que por eso no se me van a caer los . . . . . . . . ni se me va a quitar nada, es solo una costumbre y ya para saber de que familia vienes...    sonrie se feliz|`|yHkHinaMaa	Lo que pasa es que slo hay dos opciones, el apelido paterno o el materno, as que alguno hay que elegir. Si fuese al revs tambin habra polmica, porque los hombres se quejaran de que no es el suyo el que cuenta. La cosa es quejarse por algo. Hoy en da se puede elegir el orden de los apellidos que le quieres poner a tu hijo y la mujer puede conservar los suyos despus de casada, por lo tanto si los masculinos son los apellidos que normalmente se les ponen delante a los hijos es porque las mujeres queremos. ?De qu se quejan entonces?|`|sh4HJ73waa	Hasta donde yo tengo entendido ya se hace por elecin propia, ahora he visto a mucha gente que tiene comoprimer apellido el de la madre, creo que debe ser desicin de cada quien aunque me da igual, solo es un apellido.|`|5CyZ2Jmlaa	Te amo te amo... un hombre con un excelente sentido de la igualdad, por fin!!!  Yo tembin opino que es una postura machista y bastante ilgica ya que la madre siempre sabr quin es su hijo, cosa que no sucede con el padre... y eso de que la mujer adopte el apellido del marido... bullshit! Mi madre nunca lo hizo y yo tampoco lo har, porque no soy "de" nadie!!!  Bien, amigo, una estrellota para ti!!!|`|11393d1889c6de8c4c9b62c13115c065aa	comulgo con lo que dices soy abogado y en mi pas es optativo mas no obligatorio que la mujer casada pueda usar el apellido del marido, y lo peor del caso es que ellas lo usan y muchas con un tono de suficiencia como si fueran mercanca adquirida por el mejor comprador, eso se llama estupidez. espero que tomen en cuenta eso las damas cuando se casen que no es obligatorio que usen el apellido de sus esposos y mejor an que no se den la categora de cosa o propiedad no son adquisicin del esposo.

1rLqqi4waa	Go by your Venus.  Your Venus is your love style, and a Gemini and Sag Venus will get along just fine.  And you can't really count info after Jupiter, because the planets stay in one sign so long, there are literally generations under the same sign.  Anyways, your Venus signs are compatible, even if your sun signs aren't.  My only advice is just have fun.  You two are very similar, spirited individuals.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Yes I think so. Venus and Mars are compatible. Sun-Moon are compatible too.

The U.S has them months and months ahead too............probably something to do with stupid PC in the UK somewhere along the line eh :)    As for the person who commented on your grammar............they need to get out more...........grammar and spelling is very important to me too, but hey we are on YA not applying for a job in publishing or teaching English. lol Does it really, really matter that you haven't used capital letters??|`|gDoKx2WIaa	I don't know what the deal with Taken is. It has 30,000 votes on Imdb.com, and it just was released in theaters on Friday. My guess on Gran Torino though is that you were just watching a bootleg.|`|eef7Ikr3aa	Ah, now I know what you mean. Try giving titles a capitol letter and all will be revealed !  No offence but grammar is important to some of us.|`|s2mb8LNAaa	Pirates are just getting better and better these days, you saw a pirated virsion of both, nothin wrong with that, more power to ya.  The reason Grand Torino could be pirated so early is because they gave out the movie to critics a long *** time ago.

Zac is crap at acting and is defidently not "hott"    2. Rob is alright at acting, I guess... and is kind of good looking, but the "scruffy" look isn't that great.     3. Joe is terrible at acting, although, i've only seen him in Camp Rock, and he was terrible and he is terrible at singing, and is not good looking at all.     The best actor, would have to be somebody who was not found on "Disney Channel" or is off of those kind of movies.     Try, Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller, Hugh Laurie, Tom Welling, Michael Rosenbaum and Tommy Lee Jones.    Now, they're actors...|`|XdYeuzS3aa	None of them have done anything outstanding, but i like robert Pattinson in Harry Potter as Cedric.

SvzsXddUaa	He's not scary, and you shouldn't believe everything that people say about him.    1) He has a skin disease called Vitiligo. It's a skin disease that makes your skin appear all blotchy. That's how his skin color changed. And yes, it's real. He admitted it in an Oprah interview in 1993. My greataunt and my godmother's friend has it. And that's another reason why he had an umbrella over his head because he's sensitive to the sun.    Here's some links : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jac...    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15TSEKXXI...    2)No, his nose did not fall off. South Park??? Are you serious???? That TV show is not even legit. Oh man, I'm laughing at your naiveness, but at least you're interested in learning about him. Ok, he had plastic surgery on his nose TWICE. He admitted that as well.     The first REAL reason why he had plastic surgery on his nose: This happened when he was rehearsing with his brothers while he was still in the band, The Jackson 5. He was practicing his spin when he tripped and fell off the stage and broke his nose, so obviously he had to get surgery done.    The second REAL reason why he had plastic surgery done on his nose again: He had trouble breathing, and couldn't hit his notes real high like he use to, so he went to go get it corrected.    3) He doesn't like little boys and never was interested in them. He was proven INNOCENT on those allegations. He was married TWICE to WOMEN and had GIRLFRIENDS and has three children.    Watch this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpL4QRzRZ...    Oh, and by the way, those pictures you see of him is usually on flash, and it washes out his skin tone. They people who took pictures take bad pictures. He is not as pale and bad looking as you think he is. He was good looking back then, and still is. But looks shouldn't really matter. It's the inside that counts. And there are millions of women of all races who desires Michael Jackson, including celebrities like Beyonce, Chile from TLC (Usher's ex), and Brooke Hogan. And if it wasn't for MJ, then there wouldn't be a Chris Brown, Usher, Justin Timberlake, Neyo, and countless others who are influenced by him, including your Miley Cyrus (she loves MJ by the way, look on youtube about her talking about him).    Now, thank you and have a good day.  :]|`|FYjf7hkEaa	Yep, ita all true. MJ is a pedo freak of nature.|`|ZntkO9ffaa	He's a very nice man who donates to all sorts of charities.|`|XS3PexPIaa	All of it is true and much much more.|`|t1NTGuIZaa	There was a book written about him BEFORE this last child molestation thing, and the title summed it up in one word.  "FREAK".  It was written by some reporter....|`|A3RY3EBQaa	yup! he's a bit scary!!|`|NR4hbYPiaa	He has a skin disorder called vitiligo that causes loss of pigmentation.  You notice the only part of his skin you ever really see is his face and it is always covered with makeup to even out the colour, giving him a pale complexion.|`|fz0q6473aa	ugh i DO NOT want to know how he bleached his skin, he probably got surgery,, thats totally creepy,, and yes i think his nose did fall off, and yes, he likes molesting little kids too. ugghh|`|DlvDGQgpaa	Michael Jackson is a hero,  Thriller was an unreal album!|`|AA12360257	mj has a skin disorder and no his nose did not fall off he just had to much plastic surgery( I heard its addicting)|`|viHy8mGeaa	He didnt really bleach his skin...  He had a skin disorder, I forgot what it was called  Nobody knows if he really did touch a little boy, a lot of people said the boy's mother just wanted money from him    and NO his nose didn't fall off, he got plastic surgery on it    I think he's a really good singer and dancer despite all the drama with him. he's a really good guy actually.|`|iK9bJ10maa	You're 13. You have a lot to learn. Start with youtube.  But as a brief answer i'll say this:  Did he bleach his skin? no, he suffers from vitiligo.  Did his nose fall off.. south park said so? u really need to find a better source to research your info or you're gonna fail high school.  Does he like little boys? Not in the way that u imply.
bmL3W289aa	Well I watched the interview with Kristen on the David Letterman Show (or something like that, sorry I'm not from the US) and he asked her if she was still in school or if she had finished, and she replied that she was in the last year, I think. I can't remember exactly but I am positive that she said she was still in school. Whether that's tutoring or what, I don't know, but she is being educated.|`|769068c691176f6c9fe4154f357e813caa	She went to a traditional school until the seventh grade then continued on an independent study course.  She does have her high school diploma.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	tink has it right she does have her hs diploma
dWeHChwwaa	welll, no one got to meet Ty tonight, but Melissa got to see him sleeping, which i think is a pretty big deal.   As for the final two...  i really believe its going to be between Molly and Melissa. As much as i love Jillian and i am rooting for her all the way, i most definitely think its going to be down to Molly and Melissa.    which brings me to say that, dont you think that Melissa sort of reminds you of Deanna a bit? Everything about her yells Deanna, its scary.. lol|`|lgxE5nUoaa	I think the final 2 will be either Melissa and Molly or Melissa and Jillian.  Stephanie was sent home.|`|9rLi9pSRaa	No one got to meet him.  I feel sorry for the little guy.  He just wants to be with his dad and he gets the old answer, "I have to go away again"    It really isn't fair to him and Jason should wake up and smell the coffee and what he is doing to his little boy with cameras and people with clipboards in their home.  Very sad.  I hope he finally settles down after all this.  I wonder what the biological mother thinks of all this nonsense.      Last night,  Ty didn't want to part with his dad again so Jason had Melissa over for just some drinks at his house and they just peeked in at Ty sleeping .  That was it.|`|l3ZUVqB7aa	People alreay know who won the show      Spoiler    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83d8e3hNo...|`|5LxpvXSmaa	Ithink it will be Melissa and Molly are the final two. I see more of a connection there. No one meet Ty yet but Melissa saw him sleeping. I am glad Jason chose not to introduce Ty to anyone yet. That shows what a good father he is. He does not want to expose his son to someone he may get quickly connected to as in the case of Deanna. She was wrong in picking Jesse anyway we all knew that,.|`|CLXTxsoqaa	Jillian and Melissa. Nobody got to meet ty.|`|7ax12gIUaa	I think that Melissa and Molly will be the final two.  However I thought I heard somewhere that the show brings Deanna back as a twist... so maybe he ends up with her... althought I highly doubt it.
3341a3cb1622a1542336e0690a7c6ad3aa	he is lying!!!|`|AA10196640	He would eat a potato and do the Hokey Pokey!! :)|`|GmIXtIaMaa	He is going to lie.|`|AA11656721	He is about to tell a lie so get ready for it.|`|igfQac8faa	oh wow....this is good!!|`|rmQKOcp5aa	Nothing it wouldnt grow because he is telling the truth in what he feels.. therefore it would stay the same...|`|cnIUXttKaa	if he was lying it would grow but then that would make his statement true    if he was telling the truth then it would grow as well but that would mean he was lying.    i think his nose would just explode cause its so hard to come to a conclusion. lol|`|ba690cb7ce8aeb70741d69685f24db09aa	He then says that's nothing,Ive got the same magic in my penis.|`|CiGrRlQPaa	oh wow....that's quiet a paradox.|`|AA12127696	this is logic huh....i think it will not grow , because he is actually saying the truth

DcCECelaaa	You have a good voice!  Excellent volume, emotion, vocal variety, phrasing, and you hit the notes!  I gave you a good rating.  Did you learn all this on your own, or was this your vocal coach's influence?  I think you are a natural for Broadway.  Don't be shy to get your feet wet in Off-Broadway first (as I did), since we all don't start at the top, and there are plenty of good Off-Broadway productions that do pay money.    Allow me to give you a few constructive pointers.  Your weight shifting from forward to back and side to side was a bit distracting.  In Broadway, it is quite alright to strike a pose or walk about the stage but if your swaying is not necessarily to the beat of the music, you look a little nervous and less rehearsed or not adequately choreographed and blocked.  This is a matter of stage presence and poise which is much easier to learn than it is to sing or to hit the notes correctly.      Also, you had a tendency in this video to lean forward a bit much such that your shoulders rolled forward at times.  I almost got the impression you were singing to children or someone shorter than you.  You were also bending forward at the waist at times which may just be characteristic of the particular song you sang which had a somewhat threatening theme to it.  I've not viewed all your video postings but if you have an inclination to bend at the waist when you belt a song out, know that this comes across as trying a bit too hard, almost as if you are straining or being overly aggressive to get in the listeners face and be heard.  When it comes to posture, imagine yourself as a puppet suspended by a string attached to the sternum or middle of the breast bone.  This will help straighten your back and keep your shoulders from rolling forward which can come across as looking a little amateur or sloppy.    As for your tone, I'm not sure if this was the microphone system or recording acoustics, but at times your tone sounded a bit shrill and only a wee bit flat in a couple of places.  Do try to get your notes sounding very round and pleasing to the ear and not piercing or shrill.  This is just a matter of tuning your voice and training your ear to hear yourself as others hear you.  Some singers are taught to try to sing about a half note higher since the tendency for many singers is to be a bit flat, but that's just how our ears sometimes perceive our own voice.  I'm sure you have practiced this way at some point but one simple technique is to cup your hand from in front of your mouth and to your ears so the sound of the note you are trying to hit does not get distorted from bouncing off walls.    Also, I cannot overemphasize how important it is to warm your voice up and to practice your vocalizations.  Sometimes just adjusting how far you lower your jaw or open your throat and sing from your diaphragm can have dramatic impact on how you sound.  I didn't think I could sing until I had a few lessons from a professional opera singer and I was amazed how warming the voice up and a few vocalization exercises suddenly put me into a category from rank amateur to someone who could even solo and not embarrass themselves.    And one last promotional piece of advice -- Check out www.CDBaby.com if you haven't already.  This is an inexpensive way to get your music on CD and to self-promote via their website.  I've known numerous up-and-coming singers who started this way and it genuinely was a launching pad to bigger things.    You have real potential and if I were casting, I'd definitely bring you in for a call-back or award the part to you if the part were a good fit for your style and personality.    One last compliment -- GOOD HAIR!  Red heads get noticed and you have very nice, well-conditioned, long hair that was neatly groomed.  That was my first impression when your video started so keep it up as those first impressions can be lasting.|`|4SFHGHyfaa	B-|`|dthhdHADaa	sounds pretty good to me!|`|yYr412Vbaa	that was nice..seriously.  you got a nice voice ginger.|`|MU8Z9pIPaa	Opraaaaaaaa would be best for youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu      waiting for your albums ;)|`|kNAcutL0aa	yes!    dont you treat me a cheese burger or pizza with this?!|`|ZiutBoAVaa	Yes - not my favorite style,  but you have a very good voice.    ...And don't take any notice of the moron who said you're fat...|`|63dUOWFNaa	Very nice...You should keep doing it..|`|AA10130895	went to you tube , you sing well maybe you need more songs.left a comment but it didn't take.    all so if you want to get heard go to [ MY SPACE] a lot more people go though there than go to you tube..my space has a music aria that millions of people search for music.    http://music.myspace.com/index.cfm?fusea...  __________    examples of singers blogs    http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...    http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...    http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fus...    also [intent .com] is were Professional blogers go.    http://www.intent.com/|`|gKwKxJyNaa	you have a broadway singer's voice.....=) very nice|`|k9zRvawRaa	What kind of question is this?

You can download them from a number of sites, my favourite is animea.net as it has links for multiple sites (realitylapse, MU, RS, ifile etc) so you can download multiple episodes at once from different sites.    http://www.animea.net/download/1236/Code...|`|Sx26E2gDaa	Go to http://fast-tv-show-downloads.com|`|0b5OTYbeaa	just torrent the episodes and convert them|`|XPlDqZjpaa	RealityLapse.com    this is the link:  http://realitylapse.com/videos/code-geas...

AA10374849	i actually get irked when people say that's a song that's apt for christmas. weird, because there was really no reference on the season.    hallelujah (Glory to God - in english) , in cohen's version (original) i believe, is about strong love and how this was tested by one individual. he used biblical situations to explain further. "Glory" means singing praises, it is a more exuberant pronouncement of one's love.    So here are the biblical references:    1. king david did everything to please his predecessor via a special chord (using the harp), until he met bathsheba ("bathing on the roof"), who eventually tempted him  ("but you don't really care about music") in sending her husband to battle to be killed - so he could have her (a way to show how much he loved her, like breaking trust by giving the secret chord "the forth the fifth, the minor fall, the major lift").  2. "she broke your throne and she cut your hair" - delilah betrayed samson? yeah, but with the inclusion of the line "she broke your throne" it can also be about david, who lost the throne because of what she made him do.  3. "And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah" - delilah or bathsheba, due to what they have done, they've succeeded in proving the love their men had for them.  4. the cohen song ends with "It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah", meaning, with all the betrayal and deceit, the love was still there, just broken.    the extra verses (oh you should see the rest of the 80-verse composition by cohen) you mentioned was more straightforward (i think this is the rufus wainwright version). it showed parallelism between the biblical scenarios to present time - eventually saying that no matter what she has done, she would always have his love.    blind stupid love, if you ask me.    buckley's version was more about a failed relationship. as he chose (from the 80) 3 verses that clearly talked about love not being pure joy, the loss of passion (compared to before -- "But remember when I moved in you and the holy dove was moving too. And every breath we drew was hallelujah), the love that has changed, making him sad and bitter in the end - "It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah".     there were some people who related jeff's version to sex... which was more evident in cohen's re-release of the song in the 90s, which contained verses that were more sensual.    i'm not sure what religion cohen was in, but given the interpretations above, the song is far from being a gospel/christian hymn.

DI9wXRVgaa	I think you are very handsome. If the girl works in a cafe, she is probably familiar with many different types of people and she may not be deterred by your differences. I'd be sure she isn't as nice and generous to *everyone* next time I went to the cafe. Next, I would test the water and maybe ask what she likes to do in her spare time and questions along that line.|`|9Duha1k4aa	You look gay. I'm not going to lie to you. Try experimenting with fashion, collar things are not cool. And lose the pout.|`|il7bLkSIaa	you have a good face shap, and cheek bones, but you are a littleee too clean cut.    and I like guys that dress cute and take care of themselves, so that is saying a lot if I think you are too clean cut.    try tweezing your eyebrows instead of waxing them. And the spiked hair is sooo 7th grade, I suggest a "fohawk" hair style, a lot of guys in hollywood wear that right now, or just a plain short hair, no spikes.    and then I think you will be good to go!|`|Ectn7tkSaa	I am not going to rate you but i would say she seems interested and therefor not out of your league...is that reality enough for you?|`|JhvqUvlsaa	You are kinda hot and seem like a really nice guy. I wouldn't worry if she's out of your league or not right now; I would just enjoy her company at the cafe and if you two keep hitting it off, invite her for a walk on the beach or something after her shift is over.    Just play it cool; if it doesn't work out with this girl, another one is sure to follow.|`|mXFOru11aa	AAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH|`|3Kqe5ZrPaa	HELL NO, you look like a pretty gay boy...lmao|`|GcoLseVqaa	hey, i actually found a fellow pakistani on here!!!  and a muslim!  10 out of 10!|`|bce379d0f935826cb96740aa18c575c3aa	I think you are fishing for compliments, BUT, I think you are extremely hot.

Your very clean looking! Are you a Metro Sexual by chance. Don't get me wrong, I don't have a problem w/ gays..And this may seem like stereotyping..just letting you know. Try less hair stuff maybe. Does she for sure know your into her? You should write her a little note on a napkin and hand it to her as you leave. I don't think you being Pak. has anything to do w/ it.

YRsSF5Claa	Brand New - Okay I Believe You, But My Tommy Gun Don't  I am heaven sent.   Dont you dare forget.   I am all you've ever wanted,   What all the other boys all promised.   Sorry I told, I just needed you to know.   I think in decimals and dollars,   I am the cause to all your problems.   Shelter from cold.   We are never alone.   Coordinate brain and mouth,   Then ask me what its like to have my self so figured out.  Wish I knew.     I hope this song starts a craze.   The kind of song that ignites the airwaves.   The kind of song that makes people glad to be where they are,   With whoever they're there with.   This is war.   Every line is about who I dont want to write about anymore.   Hope you come down with something they cant diagnose,   Dont have the cure for.   Holding on to your grudge,   Oh its so hard to have someone to love.   And keeping quiet is hard,   Cause you cant keep a secret if it never was a secret to start.   At least pretend you didnt want to get caught.     We're concentrating on falling apart.   We were contenders, now were throwing the fight.   I just want to believe,   I just want to believe,   I just want to believe... in us.     Oh we're so c-c-c-controversial.   We are entirely smooth.   We admit to the truth.   We are the best at what we do.   And these are the words you wish you wrote down,   This is the way you wish your voice sounds,   Handsome and smart.   Oh my tongues the only muscle on my body that works harder than my heart.   And its all from watching TV,   And from speeding up my breathing.   Wouldnt stop if I could.   Oh, it hurts to be this good.   Holding on to your grudge.   Oh, it hurts to always have to be honest with the one that you love.   Oh, so let it go.     We're concentrating on falling apart.   We were contenders, now were throwing the fight.   I just want to believe,   I just want to believe,   I just want to believe.    We're concentrating on falling apart.   We were contenders, now were throwing the fight.   I just want to believe,   I just want to believe,   I just want to believe... in us.     This is the grace only we can bestow.   This is the price you pay for loss of control.   This is the break in the bend.   This is the closest of calls.   This is the reason youre alone.   This is the rise and the fall.     We're concentrating on falling apart.   We were contenders, now were throwing the fight.   I just want to believe,   I just want to believe,   I just want to believe.    We're concentrating on falling apart.   We were contenders, now were throwing the fight.   I just want to believe,   I just want to believe,   I just want to believe... in us.|`|Ssv6UqmJaa	The closest thing would be Switchfoot, the song title is meant to live.|`|8LoiVz88aa	It could be The Fray, but I'm not sure, which is stumping me right now as I am an online DJ.

uUFaLoYfaa	It is ment in a pervertedd way.  like, you say "This thing is so hard"  "Thats what she said."    Like, anything could be hard.  But the person who said, "Thats what she said"  Is talking about what a women said in bed or about sex.    Get it?  Haha.|`|nta5M5roaa	they usually mean "sex"  ex. I wanna buy one just to touch it (you can be talking about a stuffed animal or...)  That's what she said!     I'm wet! (you could have been wet from the rain or something or...)  That's what she said!    Stop hitting me with your ball!   :)|`|q9bq625Kaa	Shes are always talking and can't shut up.  Half of what they say is generally ignored.

Ha!!!.|`|6Cz56mV0aa	it only actually makes sense some of the time like if someone says:  this is really big....  go faster.....  others work just think about some|`|GyG0g6rOaa	like if i said     my *** hurts     u could say to me     thats what she said|`|CiGrRlQPaa	it works if you think about double meanings.    it's said when someone says something like "go harder" which could mean a few things.    it's used in the same contaxt as "that sounds wrong"    does that make sense?

It will be the end of the world as we know it, and a new world will begin.    It is a scary thought to think about and I was friggin' scared outta my mind when me and my friend actually started thinking about it probably 3 weeks ago.

XNbYzvhBaa	I believe there is only one (maybe two) active translator of the Full Metal Panic novel.    A little "history".    Previously, boku-tachi.net translated a good portion of the novel then they stopped due to the novel being licensed. It was picked up by Ravyn (http://ravyn-09.livejournal.com) then he/she lost hard copies of the notes and stopped.    Ravyn metioned that ultimatekane99 (http://ultimatekane99.livejournal.com) will be continuing the translation, but it is not up to date yet.    Finally we have Shutazen (http://shutazen.livejournal.com) translating the latest FMP chapter Come Make My Day. You may have to bear with the rough translation though.|`|LLn4FNWTaa	Email me at ragascorpioqb@yahoo.com with the Subject line: "FMP! Novels"    I have all of novels 4 and 5 (which cover the episodes in Full Metal Panic! the Second Raid) and 6 and 7 and 8. I also have the prologue and first chapter of novel 1 and novel 9.     For the short stories, I have Cinderella Panic! and Irrelevant Emotion.    These are all on either pdf files or in a word document so you probably don't need any other programs to open them.    If you have any questions send an email.|`|bVTiUeNraa	Are you referring to the manga? =)  If it's the manga you want, you can download it at Mangafox.com. It's already been completed.

wCZ3T5QLaa	All the time. It varies from guy to guy. Some think about physical appearance and others think about personality. I myself often find myself thinking about my girlfriend and wanting to be with her. I think mostly about her personality and her gorgeous face and why? probably because im in love who knows. Most people who think of someone all day & everyday are in love or damn near close to it. I appreciate the feeling though some find it annoying but considering no other girl i dated caught my eye the way she does i appreciate it.|`|ef831d986a5932fbeb4aaba747db2c77aa	Yes, but I'm older now.  I don't think about girls 24/7.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Yes.  Mostly thoughts of standing with her on a mountain and bathing with her in the sea.|`|aLyJe1b3aa	yup. the time we spent|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Ah huh... but it ends with me feeling ashamed *blushes*|`|Xxf5dA9jaa	hahaha.|`|70kJJJ7uaa	A bear and a bunny are pooping behind the same bush.

GOOD LUCK.|`|h4Sc2JDwaa	i wanted to punch her face in...because she threw a battery at me when i was pregnant, and i was finally no longer pregnant and all healed up.   well lets just say i dont have to think about her anymore because she got a jordan to the face (and she broke my ring with her tooth)
RqM1TZXyaa	It was on on channel nine for a while, on wednesdays at 10.30.  they jsut failed to advertise it well,  and so i think they didnt get the ratings that they wanted from it,   and dropped it.|`|j5ethbfeaa	depends on your region.  look up the broadcasting station or television program schedule and you should be able to find out|`|SUzn3qfzaa	They played like 3 eps about 3 months ago Then it never came back lol.

e8o2eP6Zaa	uki's earliest memory is of a stormy night in winter, wherein she was attacked by a vampire... And then rescued by another. Now 10 years later, Yuki Cross, the adopted daughter of the headmaster of Cross Academy, has grown up and become a guardian of the vampire race, protecting her savior, Kaname, from discovery as he leads a group of vampires at the elite boarding school. But also at her side is Zero Kiryu, a childhood friend whos hatred for the creatures that destroyed everything he held dear, is now determined never to trust them. This coexisting arrangement seems all well and good, but have the vampires truly renounced their murderous ways, or is there a darker truth behind their actions. Is Kaname's infatuation with Yuki the beginning of a forbidden romance, or is it something in her forgotten past that draws him to her. Because in this world of secrets, nothing is as it seems. And the price of misplaced trust may even be worse than death.    VK Guilty is the second season while VK is the first.|`|Bx7F9jscaa	There's a school with a day class and a night class, and the night class is vampires. The day class doesn't know that. There is a pretty good amount of action and some romance. I think it's really well done.
hCA8zIQEaa	All i notice in the CLA mix is the different tone on vocals, like a live version. The Afterlife Alternate has a full orchestra (i think its full im not an expert).

If not you may have a manual on a CD disk.  If the drivers don't install automatically, you need to install then via the disk. I have a SE too but not the same model.  It also depends on what Operating System you have as to whether you need to use the disk.

Po6Bhqfoaa	I am right handed. Oddly enough I often find  the scales etc., for the left hand easier than the right.  I can do them one handed often easier than the right. Usually  whatever I can get one hand to do the other will follow.    Here is a book you might like. I have not gone too  far in it but it is great fun.   It is from   Schirmer. Volume 1031 Berens " Training of the Left   Hand. " Cost $7.95.   It has about forty-six exercises.    You are probably far younger than I so they will  be easier for you.  Good going. Isn't music  wonderful.|`|CrAwmz65aa	The left hand does all the dirty work in the Chopin Revolutionary Etude.  You can kill two birds with one stone: practice your left hand and prepare a recital piece at the same time.|`|aFGnE9BHaa	there are many books that offer studies and etudes where the right hand is playing accompaniment, so then the left hand can become more skilful by playing these studies.|`|tuATxHsVaa	I'm going to second the person that told you to play Chopin's   "Revolutionary" etude.    That's a magnificent piece of music, much more than just an exquisite etude. Leave it to Chopin to give you a fine concert piece masquerading as a fine etude.    Here's a recording of it from Pollini:    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-VjFKLCK...    I play this piece all the time. It really does strengthen your left hand ability.

We are the Champions, Another one bites the dust, Under Pressure (sampled by Vanilla Ice in Ice Ice Baby), Crazy little thing called Love, Bohemian Rhapsody, We will rock you, You're my best friend, Somebody to love, I want it all, I want to break free and the list goes on...  He sadly died from complications of the AIDS virus back in 1991.|`|b9df73d334ed0c53c1be865bb2b4cd98aa	Freddie Mercury was the lead singer of Queen (One of the Greatest bands ever) and also a awesome songwriter  He wrote great songs like We will rock you and Another on bites the dust|`|bbcdb7567db47a2d8a81e3abaec851e3aa	He was the lead singer of a British rock band named "Queen" that was very popular in the 70's.  They had many, many hits during that period, including Bohemian Rhapsody, We Will Rock You, and We Are the Champions (of the world).|`|977b3ea9275982c81844983821ed8abdaa	Freddie was the Singer of the Rock band ('70's&'80's) Queen.  He publically announced that they would take the  1 in the charts position away from Led Zepplin, and they made a damn good try at doing just that.  He died of Aids in 198? just as the band were hitting their stride.  Tough loss.  Great band.

He sang such classics as Bohemian Rhapsody, We are the champions, bicycle race, another one bites the dust, and a lot more!|`|344a551af45802b358113bd29b658739aa	Freddie Mercury was the lead vocalist of the British rock band Queen. He, along with his bandmates, wrote and recorded songs to make himself famous and well-known not only in England but in the entire world as well. Songs that Mercury and Queen made include "We Will Rock You", "We Are The Champions", "Another One Bites The Dust", "Killer Queen", and "Bohemian Rhapsody". I suppose you heard one or all of those mentioned songs.|`|289c7798bad08d50261b0cc51e1dbc94aa	Freddie Mercury was the lead singer and main song writer for the rock group, Queen; one of the all-time greatest bands on earth!  He is famous for his music, which people could not genreize.  He did a little bit of everything, incorporated rock, opera, rap, classical, pop, R&B, and so much more, making truly universal music.  In death, he was famous for being the first celebrity to be killed by AIDS.  He had a commanding stage presence and was loved by millions.  When he died, there was a tribute concert held at Wimbly Stadium in his honor and to support AIDS research and protection.  It was the first, and possibly greatest, AIDS charity ever.  Great names of the time, who had known Freddie, worked with him and the band, or had heard of him and his music and his amazing stage acts, all came together to honor him and to try and keep others from following his footsteps: Metallica, Def Leoppard, Guns & Roses, Annie Lennox, David Bowie, George Michael, Extreme, Elton John, and even Elizabeth Taylor & Liza Manneli.  Freddie was open about his homosexual lifestyle, and no one really cared, because he was so talented and so amazing.  He spent hours signing thigns for his fans, talking to them, making them know he cared.  He released the news about his illness days before he died, while working on a new CD with the Band.  Queen was asked, virtually BEGGED, to write the music to the movie "Highlander", which was not only a successful movie, but a successful soundtrack as well.  There are countless fan sites dedicated to Freddie Mercury and all he was.  My suggestion to you is to watch a video clip of him in concert, s that you understand why people loved him.|`|59f20c6929a0f2e01902750b141dabccaa	He was the lead singer of the group Queen.

So the blonde walked back home and dyed her hair red, then came back to the shop, "Can I please buy that tv" but again, the guy at the counter said, "Sorry, but you can't buy that because you're a blonde." so again she went back home and dyed her hair black and went back to the shop and asked for the tv again thinking she would have more hope of getting it because they guy at the counter had gone home and another one replaced him. "Sorry," he began, "but you can't buy that because you're a blonde." "How do you know I'm a blonde," said the blonde. "Because thats not a TV, its a microwave."|`|7AqZzEEWaa	DONT KNOW I WILL ASK HER WHY DO YOU LOVE PLAYING ON THE COMPUTER?

I used points from home work and my sisters house. I got an Auburn Basketball. It came very quick and it was actually of better quality than I thought it would be. The problem is (for me) getting enough points. It took forever and the basketball was only like 250 points or something like that.

If you would like to apply home remedies to reduce dark circles, here are some of my suggestions:  Buy a box of regular, old fashioned unflavored gelatin (e.g. Knox) from grocery store. Take a small cup or bowl and put in 1 teaspoon of the gelatin mix. Add one tablespoon of boiling water & stir for a minute. Test it on your wrist to make sure it is not too hot. Then, using a cotton ball, pat it under your eyes as you would an eye cream or gel. Go lie down and listen to some music, or take a bath & let it stay on for at least 30 minutes. Then just rinse it off.Gelatin is very high in Vitamin K & Biotin. It will not remove your dark circles on the first application (but you will notice a difference), but if you do it daily for a week, and then 2-3 times a week for maintenance, you should notice a drastic reduction in dark circles.  http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com/2007/01...        http://www.mydarkcirclesblog.com .. tips on how to reduce dark circles, the causes of dark circles, home remedies, eye creams reviews, make up tips, and natural healer.|`|AA11609393	Yep I've got em...Not super bad but enough that I use concealer.
nml1djFKaa	I don't know about SMC, but try doing on research on vocational schools for nursing.  You get a smaller student to teacher ratio, therefore you get more individual attention and that helps you accelerate.  I went to a vocational school for a degree in law, and I'm so grateful that I did.  Vocational schools can save you a lot of money and time.  There are even more scholarships and grants available if you attend a vocational school.  And they are just as respected as Universities.|`|yUbR0NnRaa	El Camino College in Torrance & Harbor College in Harbor City/San Pedro actually have really good teachers for nursing. My mom got her RN @ El Camino  & still takes courses at Harbor.  The classes tend to be smaller and have more hands on time with the teachers.    SMC is really overrated & overcrowded.|`|yvztxg1eaa	I dont know about nursing, but santa monica is a liberal rat hole

jBlsZhMAaa	Just last month I was drivin home from a nursing class that was an hour away from where we lived. On the way home, my transmission went outta my truck. I was so upset cause I just had one put in last year and it costed me $1,500. My b/f and I have an extra vehicle so I parked it in the barn and was just gonna let it sit till I had the extra money to fix it. He knew how upset I was about it cause I love my truck and I hate drivin our Jeep Wrangler. When I came home the next day, my truck was gone. He had spent all day callin around to get it in somewhere to get it fixed, he got ahold of a buddy of his to fix it for real cheap, and had it hauled over there. It was soooo sweet!!

The room is $30 to start. Each man payed 10. The bellboy came back with the 5, kept two and gave 1 each back.  After the 30 to 25 dollar decrease, each man paid 8.33333 each. Then they each get 1 back, 9 and one third, or 9.33333,   this number x3 = 28, plus the 2 the bellboy kept, back to 30.    The issue here is that you go from a total cost to individual cost, but never fully divided the cost when we were down to 25 total for the room. Its the missing .33333 per man that makes up the dollar difference.  ***  Correction: Each man ultimately paid 7.66666 each for the room, and .666666 each to the bellboy  25 - 2 to the bell boy = 23    23 / 3 = 7.6666666666666666666666666666667     2 / 3 = 0.66666666666666666666666666666667    each man paid for room and tip - 7.6666666666666666666666666666667 +  0.66666666666666666666666666666667 = 8.3333333333333333333333333333327      8.3333333333333333333333333333327 x 3 = 25|`|x7aIZHyoaa	The bellboy should've refunded each man $1.66, and keep the $.02 for himself.

(That's if you're from the US!)|`|ViP0jqc6aa	Dolm, you're just confusing. It's simple.    Yes, there's a flaw. When we find out the room is $25 rather than $30, it says "this meant that  the 3 men each paid $9 for the room" WRONG. This means they paid $8.3 repeat. NOT 9. Add it up now and it makes sense.

Certo anke il cast nn  da sottovalutare...!se il  film ne possiede 1abbastanza rinomato.. meglio ancora.. !anke se spesso nn  cosi.. il nome del cast  puo viziare il fim nella sua complessit rendendolo il tipico "bello x forza"...

Se sono al cinema e vedo un trailer che mi ispira lo vado sicuramente a vedere....x ovviamente se so che c' un attore o una attrice che mi piace vado a vederlo anche se non ho guardato il trailer!!  Comunque io consulto Filmup dove puoi vedere tutte le uscite dei film ordinate x giorno di uscita...mi scrivo quelli che mi ispirano e poi vado!!!|`|B9xiGod1aa	Ovviamente non vado a vedere un film che a livello di tematiche, ambientazione, genere o semplicemente trama non mi ispira, anzi. Sono sempre molto scettica prima di scegliere un film da andare a vedere - specie al cinema, visti i prezzi! - e cerco di informarmi, di capire bene di cosa parla e in che tono. Spesso, poi, controllo se non ho gi visto qualcosa dello stesso regista:  inutile che io torni a vedere qualcosa di Terrence Malick, visto e considerato che tutti i suoi film mi hanno fatta addormentare dopo massimo dieci minuti! D'altro canto, prima di andare a vedere un film controllo anche il cast, sia perch se devo scegliere tra un bel film con mister x e un bel film con Sean Bean... beh, scusatemi,  ma Sean Bean viene prima!, sia - dicevo - perch spesso ci sono attori che scelgono di interpretari film di un certo genere che magari a me piace. Ad esempio Kevin Spacey fa quasi sempre film di un certo livello, mai noiosi e mai banali, e quindi se esce un suo film corro a vederlo, gi abbastanza sicura che mi possa piacere. Mi fido del suo gusto, insomma. In definitiva, quindi, credo che sia prima una scelta di trama, poi di cast, ma entrambi ugualmente importanti. Diciamo che la trama fa la prima sfoltitura, poi una volta che si hanno due o tre scelte si va in base al cast. Ovvio che ci siano eccezioni: ho i miei attori preferiti e cerco di guardare tutti i loro film - se appena appena penso che mi possano piacere. E, giusto per inciso, Scamarcio non  tra questi.|`|jUwvArIfaa	beh,dipende! La trama  importantissima,perch racconta la storia del film. Se non ti piace un film d'azione, inutile che vai al cinema a guardare Mission Impossible solo perch c' Tom Cruise!! ma  anche vero che se gli Attori non sanno recitare.........il film  uno schifo!!!!!!   baci|`|e0d1efa1f011991966bd404c42464ab6aa	al cast|`|w9P4JEzgaa	trama!  ma se fra gli attori c' qualcuno che mi piace,ancora meglio!|`|iVe81fgjaa	Considero sia la trama del film che il cast.

I'd suggest using some vitamin E cream on the areas that burned; you can get it at most drugstores, and the generic (which I personally prefer) is very inexpensive.  As I'm sure you know, the more important thing to do is prevent further exposure, so be sure to use a good sunscreen in the future.  You can't "erase" the exposure you've already had; you can only minimize future exposure.|`|AA10797291	You don't want a tan? lol I don't know what to tell you except, try aloe vera moisturizer.|`|Cf294Tozaa	try ice...|`|511400f1f609d3383eccc131db37d700aa	unless your a person who don't easily tan u may be ok...if u do not much u can do about it....just stay out the sun for the rest of the summer or cover up when you do go out.|`|fILIRYGQaa	It will probably tan no matter what you do, but maybe if you put Noxzema on it the "burn" will come out faster and be less painful.

Double click one the one you want.  In my experience, u might want to pik the file that has between 2 and say 10 sources.  Any more than that and you might be getting a file that wants a license (boo!) or worse an advertisement/spam/link to the web that is seriously annoying.  Any less than that and you might not be able to successfully download due to timing out or the other person disconnecting or it taking way too long and getting bored of waiting.  At any rate, once you choose the file you want and start the downloading, it will progress until the song is downloaded. If it won't play due to needing a license, either pay "the man" like he wants you to or delete the song and find another file that doesn't need it.

Being the younger son of the Superstar Krishna , Krishna's fans had to wait for a long time for their star son make his appearance as an adult. but it was worth their wait when he made his debut with Rajakumarudu, emerging as a new star of the Telugu Cinema. his first appearance in front of the camera was in the movie, Poratam. following which, he made several other appearances in movies. but decided in his ninth standard to take a break and concentrate on his studies.     so, away from the arc lights, he studied in Loyola college, Chennai and re-entered the film industry only after finishing his B.com. most of his films were run-away hits and he soon became the heart-throb of tollywood.     but when asked about his type of a heart throb, he said that he's looking for a 'nice girl'---like his mother who's 'unassuming, genuine and simple'.|`|ff67059279cd73a6cea6a5e01a25db91aa	http://celebs.ceeby.com/actors/maheshbab...    that's who he is.

You may want to pay a small fee for  insurance on the shipment to protect it in case of damage.  UPS & Fedex cover $100 in shipping damages automatically  If you get a UPS account you can print shipping labels directly from your computer.
AA10065620	I know what Savatage you are talking about.  Hand Full of Rain Savatage, former guitarist Alex Skolnick Savatage, Oliva brothers Savatage... Their obscurity is a mystery summed up in the question everyone's asking (well, at least I am)...     Why is it that all of these musical groups with no talent always become so popular, while the real talent gets left in the shadows?  I don't know the real answer to that, but I hope the answer has something to do with the real talented people doing it for the sake of the music instead of the money and fame.      Without being too idealist, though, I'd say that Savatage is obscure because they appeal to a limited crowd (with taste) and these days that following is obviously enough to keep them going, so for now just appreciate the fact that the world isn't drooling over them...

AA11277210	You mean the version completely seperate from the Robotech series?  I'd love to be able to find that one.  History for anyone who doesn't know: The robotech Saga are actually 3 completely unrelated anime series that have been edited, mashed together and brought to America to present one whole story; Macross is the first series, Southren Cross is the second and Mospeada, known here as the Invid invasion, is the third.  Rick Hunter is used to bring all three series together.  He's the main protagonist in the first one, is mentioned a few times in the second, and is leading a fleet back to Earth to fight the Invid in the third.  I've never been able to find an unaltered version of Mospeada anywhere.  I know this in no way answers your question (sorry) but it might be interesting to anyone else reading this.|`|d6d4b954b132cf9d6d3bc142c81c2c57aa	yes i have it...u can't get the free version from internet...but it is worth investing ur $ into|`|4fadb8bf743c0e990f12cddf3e917d7baa	I'm afraid I don't know where you can get the "Original Original" MOSPEADA (unadulterated or edited into a part of Robotech), but the Mospeada portion of Robotech (as well as the Macross and Southern Cross portions) are available from robotech.com in the store section. Also eBay might be an option... or even your local comic book shop or movie store may be able to get hold of them. I know AnimEIGO recently released the "Original Original" Superdimension Fortress Macross (the Macross portion of Robotech) in subtitled-English only (not long after ADV Films released Robotech in its entirety on DVD)... haven't heard any plans to do the rest, but you never know.

Then you go all the way to the right and to the bottom again and in the bottom right corner you will find the lever and the chain. First you click on the lever and that opens another door back up top and all the way to the left.

f2799c4faf53cc91476d8d7ccbdfd692aa	I think a perfect example is U2's "one".  I love this song. it's so brilliant. when i listen to them perform it live, it sounds so uplifting and hopeful, so very optimistic about how we can be one. one planet, one life, all that stuff.   that song has been used for a variety of uplifting moments (world cup, One campaign to end poverty, etc etc), ironically, it was written about the bitterness of a relationship falling apart. people sing along all the time, but if you really look at the lyrics:  "We're one   But we're not the same   Well we   Hurt each other   Then we do it again   You say   Love is a temple   Love a higher law   Love is a temple   Love the higher law   You ask me to enter   But then you make me crawl   And I can't be holding on   To what you got   When all you got is hurt"  it's a break up song (as Bono puts it in his own words: 'It amazes me when people tell me they played it at their wedding or for comfort at a funeral. I go to myself, "Are you crazy? It's about breaking up." ' (Los Angeles Times, 8:th of August 2004)).    what i love is the story behind the song: it was written while U2 were going through tough times as a band, and it saved them from breaking up. They had spent some time discussing whether or not they had finally used up all of their creative energy and talent. Eventually, they decided that they probably had, and Bono went to the mic and began playing this song. The rest of the band began to play along, and they soon had a renewed faith in themselves. They completed the rest of the album (Achtung Baby) afterwards.|`|2933db9c8d959e23f044f9270c194458aa	I listen to:  1.Christina Agulaira-soar,       -Keep singing my song  2.Kanye West- Bring me Down  3.Linken Park- In the End   4.Athena Cage- All or Nothing  5.

Taurus is the sign of stubborn bull  Jesus said to them, Dont be a fool.  Virgos are pragmatic, dramatic  They draw schematics.  Jesus said, "I dont care if it is to scale.  If you are good, you wont go to Hell."    [Repeat Chorus]    Pisces are the watery sign of  fish.  They often sigh and often wish.  Jesus said, Pray for your desire,  Send it higher, or it might expire.  If you are an Aquarius, you are gregarious  You live vicarious, you are hilarious.  Jesus said, please get serious,  You are making me delirious!  Leo the Lion growls with a roar  They are often lambs behind their door.    [Repeat Chorus]    Jesus said, You are my flock.  Open your heart, leave it unlocked.  Cancer is the sign of the crab.  They often have a gift for gab.  Jesus said, Just dont lie or defy,  Crawl on stone...I want you to fly.  Back to Gemini, the twin  They show up on pure whim.  Jesus said, You must hear my song,  Dual nature alone, won't move you along.    [Repeat Chorus]    Sing praise for Heavenly Father, up above.  Sing it with heart and heartfelt love.  Sagittarius is often lucky and free.  They land on their feet, two out of three.  Jesus said, Be sure to place your trust in me,  Your luck is a gift for the glory of Thee.  Libra is the balance of the scale.  They often use reason to trade and sell.  Jesus said, "Balance is good,  Be sure to use it as you should.    [Repeat Chorus]    Scorpio the scorpion is last on the list.  They can sting or love in lust and bliss.  Jesus said, Stick to lovin and less lust,  And you know, in who you can trust.  This goes for everyone, everywhere:  Be kind, and lovin, and always care,  Offer your praises thru your prayer  Be good to each other, if you dare  I want you in the Heavens above  I say this to you, from a place of Love.    Ooooh:  If you are an Aquarius, you are gregarious  You live vicarious, you are hilarious.  Jesus said, please get serious,  You are making me delirious!

GANHE DINHEIRO FCIL E RPIDO VOC J IMAGINOU GANHAR R$ 25.000,00 EM MENOS DE 4 SEMANAS?? ACHA IMPOSSVEL?? ENT?O LEIA ESTE ARTIGO E COMEMORE!!!     INTRODU??O    Ol! Eu tenho timas notcias que devem demorar uns trs minutos para ler. Voc alguma vez pensou \"Como eu posso faturar alto em pouco tempo???\" , ou esteve devendo muita grana, pronto a realizar qualquer coisa para conseguir pagar suas contas? Ent?o, pegue uma cerva, uns salgadinhos, se arrume em sua cadeira e leia este texto realmente interessante, um verdadeiro achado (E foi achado por acaso na Internet). Vou come?ar dizendo que EU FINALMENTE ACHEI A SOLUC?O!!  isso mesmo, eu descobri! E EU ODEIO ESTES ESQUEMAS DE FICAR RICO EM POUCO TEMPO!!!   Eu j hvia tentando muitas coisas na internet, muitos sistemas e nunca tinha conseguido nada. Mas quando li este, vi que iria funcionar pois este sistema funciona conforme a hosnestidade das pessoas e raramente vc consegue um sistema como este.     O custo  baixo e o retorno  alto Leia e voc vai entender porque.     Voc deve seguir as instru??es e mandar este artigo para todos os lugares que voc puder e imaginar! O quanto voc mandar vai determinar a quantidade de dinheiro que ir chegar em sua caixa de correspondncia!!  simplesmente muito fcil de se realizar!!! Vamos revisar agora os motivos que voc tem para fazer isso: O custo  de somente 6 selos e 6 notinhas de um real que voc manda para os nomes da lista pelo correio (o servi?o postal de seu pas). Ent?o simplesmente mande este arquivo (COM O SEU NOME ADICIONADO A ELE) para tudo quanto e Rede de mensagens e BBS que conhe?a e possa. Depois se sente, ironicamente, de um passeio at a sua caixa de correspondncia e pegue a sua recompensa!!   Todos ns temos R$ 6,00 para colocar em tal investimento com RETORNO REALSTICO DE $15.000 A $ 25.000 entre 3 a 5 semanas! Ent?o deixe a loteria um pouco de lado, coma em casa ao invs de gastar os 6 reais (no Brasil) comendo fora e utilize esta fortuna) neste espantoso sistema de fazer dinheiro!!! N?o tem como perder!!!!!!!!   Voc ent?o pergunta: \"Como fazer isso exatamente, sem dar problemas?\" E eu te respondo: Eu cuidadosamente escrevi da forma mais detalhada, as instru??es mais fceis possveis de entender de como encaminhar a grana para voc.     ENT?O, VOC EST PRONTO PARA GANHAR DINHEIRO?   ENTAO A VAMOS NS!!!     *** A LISTA DE NOMES ESTA NO FINAL DESTE ARTIGO. ***   Ok, leia tudo isso cuidadosamente. Imprima estas informa??es, se quiser, para que voc possa facilmente utilizada como referncia quando precisar.     INSTRU??ES:   1 PASSO: Pegue um peda?o de papel e escreva nele o seguinte: \"Por favor me coloque na sua lista\" . Isto cria o servi?o a partir do sistema de ganhar dinheiro e o torna TOTALMENTE LEGAL. Se voc n?o gosta da idia de mandar R$1,00 para algum, tenha em mente que voc esta pagando esta quantia para um servi?o legal. Tenha certeza que voc incluiu o seu nome e endere?o. Eu asseguro a voc, novamente, que isso e complemente legal! Apenas por divers?o, escreva tambm em qual nmero a pessoa estava: \"Voc estava no nmero 3\". Isso  o chama ganhar dinheiro enquanto se diverte, ou unir o til ao agradvel.   2 PASSO: Agora dobre este peda?o de papel em volta da nota que voc vai mandar (nada de cheques ou vales),os coloque em um envelope e mande para as seis pessoas da lista. Dobrar o papel em volta da nota assegura que o dinheiro vai chegar ao seu devido destinatrio. ESTE PASSO  FUNDAMENTAL!!!!   3 PASSO: Agora leia cuidadosamente, que ESTA  A PARTE QUE FALA COMO O DINHEIRO VAI CHEGAR ATE VOC. Elimine o primeiro nome da lista e em seguida reordene a lista de 1 a 5, ou seja ( 2 torna-se 1, 3 torna-se 2 e assim sucessivamente). Agora coloque o seu nome e endere?o como o sexto da lista.   4 PASSO: Agora fa?a o Upload (Mande) do arquivo para quantas reas de Redes de Mensagens e reas de arquivos (fruns ou newsgroups) forem possveis. Coloque como descri??o algo como: \"Precisa de grana urgente? Aqui esta a solu??o!\" ou \"Precisa de dinheiro para pagar o que deve??\", etc. E quanto mais Uploads voc fizer, mais grana voc vai ganhar, e  claro, mais grana os outros da lista v?o ganhar tambm. O SEGREDO DESTE SISTEMA  A HONESTIDADE DOS PARTICIPANTES E CONSEGUIR 5.000% DE LUCRO NESTE SISTEMA!! Voc vai se maravilhar com os benefcios, pode acreditar!! Determine um nmero concreto de Uploads que vai fazer, um mnimo de 500 Uploads. E tenha sempre em mente que quanto mais Uploads voc fizer, mais grana voc far. Se voc tiver problemas em fazer Uploads, pega ajuda ao SysOp da BBS que voc estiver, que ele ter prazer em te ajudar. E jamais coloque descri??es milagrosas como \"Consiga uma enchente de um milh?o saindo de sua caixa de correspondncia em apenas dois dias!\". - Voc nunca ter respostas de ningum!!!   5 PASSO: Este  o passo que eu mais gosto. APENAS SENTE-SE E APROVEITE A VIDA PORQUE A GRANA EST A CAMINHO!! Tenha em mente que geralmente apenas uns trocados aparecem em 2 semanas, mas na 3 e 4 semanas, uma tempestade de GRANA VAI DESTRUR A SUA CAIXA DE CORREIO de t?o cheia!!!! E tudo o que voc precisar fazer  pegar a grana e tentar n?o gritar muito alto, quando perceber que FINALMENTE CONSEGUIU ALCAN?AR OS SEUS SONHOS, e ficou cheio da grana!!!

H um tempo tempo atrs nos dias de sexta-feiras sempre passava filmes de terror, com Peter Cushing, Vicent Price, Jack Palance. De vampiro passou vrios com um ator que ficou muito conhecido como um bom intrprete de drcula por causa do desenho do seu rosto. J vi a "Morte do Dr. Morte", "A volta do Dr. Morte", "O castelo de drcula", vrios.   Hoje os filmes de terror se baseiam muito nos efeitos especiais e a??o, s vezes, muito exagerada. N?o tem necessidade de se fazer filmes de terror com muita a??o, o que pesa muito  ter uma boa histria.

AA10518918	I don't know about in your area but in my area (Virginia) they will be doing a repeat airing of the premire tonight (Friday, September 22). You can go to http://tv.yahoo.com and put the keyword 'Greys Anatomy" in to find out what is airing next and when in your area. Then just search for the episode called "Time Has Come Today" thats it. It'll even tell you what channels it will air on. Otherwise you're pretty much stuck waiting for them to show a rerun later in the season. Hope this helps!|`|6460bb4bd6fbba16258b48508d8f0e76aa	Sorry, that's tough! I feel your pain but spare a thought for us down here in New Zealand - we probably won't see it for 6 months or so.

a0154e79bc08776f43c052f5abe131b4aa	Maybe it a joke reference to actress Adrianne Barbot *who was in the original "Swamp Thing"      Edit: I think D did spell it right.  She was indeed on Maude and is rather well endowed in the chest region*|`|91d98b4911c5be00902470081ef1d404aa	All I know is Adrian Bardeau (not sure of exact spelling) is an actress that played "Maude's"daughter.

AA10728326	Practice long tones.  Like the two previous answers said it's probably not enough air.  I believe the trumpet takes a faster, or more forceful stream of air than the saxophone.      Practice playing long tones.  Play a scale and draw out every note for like 12-16 beats.  Concentrate on a flat tone and taking the airiness out of it....do not use vibrato during these exercises.    Sure they're boring, but it's the best way to improve tone and also embachure.  You're used to playing the sax, so you need to build up a different set of muscles to play the trumpet.      Remember patience is key to learning any new instrument (and anything else for that matter).  Remember how long it took for you to learn to play the saxophone.  Take it one step at a time and don't get discouraged.  Good luck.|`|52929e5eac647852dac1243a1cf3ce66aa	My band director says that the airy sound is caused by the air not going through fast enough. You have to keep a firm lip and make sure you aren't blowing air too slow.|`|7aa4dd8b8d7d92a99d4dd889c6aeed94aa	You need to blow harder.

vqg6wpCLaa	Sensitive Pornograph, if you're into yaoi (yes, nudity involved).     Vampire Knight has its moments, in my opinion and it's cute. XP    Also, Ouran High School Host Club also has its moments and is also cute.    A manga you can read is Haru no Koi (on mangafox.com) - it has nudity, it is cute, and there is some pretty...steamy moments.     There is also Elfen Lied, where there is some nudity. Not really cute since it is filled with action and gore but is a good series overall.    EDIT: Also, it would be best to specify which anime you have already seen in the past so no one repeats them.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	Elfen Lied and Blood+|`|SFZq3ullaa	umm most sexy stuff without nudity is  pretty girlie..    like  Sakura's Diaries   and  CHOBITS (a must)  very HOT very cutsie    if you are looking for the x-rated hentai  i recommend:  discipline  and  blood royal  to start     feel free to email if you want more info or more suggestions|`|P9wB5Epdaa	Mnemosyne:  http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclop...|`|io4WrL0qaa	I SO KNOW THIS QUESTION!!!!

93l6zA0Haa	It was, I think, a bit sad. There was a time when Bruce could have just hopped up on the piano. Instead, like an old dog that can no longer jump up on the bed, he had to walk up some little steps. Then there was the dramatic moment when he leaned all the way back, dramatic because he got stuck that way and I thought they were going to have to send the trainers on the field to assess him to see if he had to be taken out of the game.  The best thing I can think to say about it is thank al that is Holy that the show was not in 3D.....  If it was, half the country would still be traumatized from "The Boss" going balls deep in the camera.    It was what it was.....  The half time show almost never lives up to the hype, but at least it gives us a break from Madden's semi coherent grunts.  Although, I was more than a little surprised that Mr. Madden actually made it through an entire broadcast without gushing about, and comparing every one too, Brett Favre...    We watch for the game and the commercials.   Not always in that order.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	No.  I can't stand him or his "music".  They should have had Led Zeppelin.

Don't think of it as bad karma.  Think about it as you know what you want and what you're looking for.  You know yourself well enough to know right off the bat that he's not the one.

K9X0q7Whaa	I love omega red, but due to cyber's adamantum plateing i'd have to say him since omega realy has nothing that could damage it other than finding something in thier fighting envirornment.  And as for wolverine...I'd say the hulk since he never has realy beaten him and he did debut in hulk's comic.    but in the x-men comic books...Apocolipse comes to mind frequently.
xmdh8iY3aa	Wow I'm shocked that is the way you think but my guess is you're probably not alone in that assessment. That album had heavyweight producers all over it.     NY State of Mind - DJ Premier. One of his best beats of all time. The dark eerie piano loop gels with Nas' lyrics and sets the mood perfectly.    Life's a ***** - L.E.S. How can you go wrong with a Yearning For Your Love sample?    The World is Yours - Pete Rock. While I agree its not his best work its still dope.    Halfime - Large Professor. Killer production, how can you not love that rolling bass line? And the horns in the chorus.    Memory Lane - DJ Premier. Ill beat. C'mon man listen to the scratched chorus. He pulled off some classic Juice Crew samples. And the keyboard riff combined with the "oo ooh ooh" throughout the song just makes you reminisce.     One Love - Q Tip. Horrible, no. Sub par maybe. But I still like it.    One Time 4 Your Mind - Large Professor. Definitely sub par. The only song I don't like on the album    Represent - DJ Premier. While not one of Premo's elite beats, its still a nice simple flow and lets Nas spit venom.     It Ain't Hard to Tell - Large Pro. Now you just plain out to lunch if you think this is a wack beat. How can you possibly go wrong with Human Nature as your back drop????    I suggest you listen a few more times before you make up your mind.|`|NzkPEKYgaa	How can you insult mainly Premo, some Pete Rock and more Large Professor?|`|BnTYoxUIaa	Illmatic is OVERRATED!!!|`|os6FaEBlaa	I agree with that, but I mean the production was really terrible it's was good.|`|ioNTTqKfaa	Maybe its an age thing. When I was 15 I wasn't into the beats but now I'm in my 20s and realize they're sick.    NY State of Mind  The World is yours  Memory Lane  One Love (you trippin if you think its garbage)    are all very sick beats. The rest are okay, but in no way bad. This album was produced by the best ny producers at the time and most people are going to disagree with you.|`|3nRfePaaaa	"One Love" is horrible?  That's probably the first beat that uses the xylophone to perfection...  that beat was great.    production wasn't wack  Only beat I didn't like was "One Time For Your Mind".  the rest was great.  Can't go wrong with Premo, Tip, Pete Rock, and Large Pro on an album.    5 Murs songs w/ wack beats :  Transitions Of A Rider  1st Love  Murs Rules The World  I Did It Like That  Truth|`|HimBbU6caa	Alrighty then.|`|lMOXHh45aa	that would be q- tip. you want q-tip to die.|`|lN2KE3uwaa	Lyrics are ill, idk about beats sorta.|`|ebvNEvj1aa	Yeah I kind of agree...I did a run through the album...and while I found the lyrics impressive, I didn't really find myself wanting to listen to it :| But I'll probably check it out in a few months again, my opinion might change ( I initially didn't like listening to Tupac...but I love him now so...)|`|hA5m65Waaa	isnt this Murs' career story|`|IA4x5oPMaa	agreed|`|uZQIUeyvaa	thats why it is a classic. Befor clubs were all people cared about lyrics were important. The lyrics are fire and that is more important than beats.|`|bribxhsdaa	Because....and this WILL blow your mind out of your ears.    It's actually possible for an albums LYRICS to be worth more than its production. Although that said, the production on Illmatic is good. The lyrics are definitely better than the production which says more about the quality of the lyrics than the quality of the production. idk what you're talking about "sub-par" beats.    It ain't hard to tell was one of the first big Horn loops,  NY State Of Mind is a centre piece of east-coast production and Halftime is one of the best Large Professor productions of all time...And if you're saying that one of Large Pro's best productions is sub-par at best then you know nothing about hip hop production >_>.    If you're listening to NaS and expecting to be won over by beats ...YOU need to be slain(Wait...being slain isn't a nice thing..Shame on you STK) NaS has never needed high end production to spit over. (He's definitely had his fair share but it's never been essential to his Rap M.O.)    Infact, that same idea is what baffles me as to why MC's like Canibus, Ras Kass and Pharoahe Monch can't break the game wide open. Because they all spit to beats that emphasise their lyrical ability but don't neccesarily overshadow it..(Source)|`|AjPUD3Jsaa	because people have diff. definitions of what a classic is. just cause susie says it is doesnt mean you have to believe it..so whats the problem?|`|XDvOwLlNaa	I thought most of the production was good actually, I'll agree that One Love beat SUCKS tho...    on the topic, I think Ready to Die has terrible beats|`|f6522a133ad73f5b55bf2bbba116748daa	When that CD was out, it wasn't just about the beats back then.  That's why Nas is known as one of the best lyricists. Some of the artist that are supposedly "the best" today wouldn't have been able to put out a CD back then because they don't have anything to say.  If you listen to some of the hottest rap songs out right now acapella, it would be garbage.  People are getting by off hot beats.|`|icHu3hN4aa	L.E.S., DJ Premier, Q-Tip, Pete Rock, and Large Professor and the beats are sub par?  Get the **** out of here.  Easily one of the best produced hip-hop albums of all time.  True hip-hop heads are going to have to agree with me.|`|9Kc3NcMiaa	well NaS' kryptonite has always been his beat selection, it overall sucked......but DEFINETELY NOT from this album bro......maybe later on on I Am... & even Stillmatic had some boring beats, but ILLMATIC??? The World Is Yours? Halftime? Ain't Hard 2 Tell? C'mon bro...    "true in the game as long as blood is blue in my veins, I pour my heineken brew to my deceased crew on memory lane...."    u do have some what of a point tho, cuz lyrics like that would be classic anyway....still, I think this is one of his better albums, production-wise      and shout out to MURS too......Murs For President was good
41mwqPuPaa	RZA  Unspoken Word|`|uoE2Zvs6aa	Ryan Leslie  Dark Child   DJ Khaled   Polo Da Don  Timbaland  & Shawty Redd are some really good producers
X3BsNxPbaa	I like the Akatsuki too =]  My favs are Sasori, Kisame, Deidara, Konan and Itachi.    I like NaruSaku, but personally I prefer the Sai&Sakura pairing.    I don't like Sasuke either.
868rE46gaa	It was great! It was also the first commercial that I saw when I turned on the game.    But as far as humor goes... I agree with the people above... Pepsuber is the winner.|`|RMHOO0Mhaa	It was ok, none of the ads this year were as good (at least to me and my friends) as they have been on years past|`|nEksvU3Iaa	It was good!!|`|1SBundNFaa	i like the macgruber pepsi commercials better|`|f4ehvRQlaa	it was cool.|`|i9MlY6J3aa	lol the macgruber one was form Saturday Night Live the night before!!!
f45b8ff41e1fa90ae65c8a0db95a90d1aa	of course she will change her mind and keep the baby  i hope amy breaks up with ben because he is starting to annoy me with his clingy behavior|`|fZjHAxwHaa	whats the question? lol   I loooovee that show!  i hope she keeps the lil boy too! (:  haha.|`|wUaMEwSsaa	yeah i agree the show would kinda be  pointless if she gives up the baby  if she did it would be selfish|`|jXydrX3maa	yea i hope she keeps the baby for the shows sake,,,i love that show!  that way she can show all the difficulty's of raising a child at 15,,witch has got to be hard,,it was for me at 17.  but then again it could also be put up for adoption and shoe the prossess and the good things or whatever that come out of adoption with also the heartaches and struggles of giving the little stinker up! so it could go either way, it would just be alot cooler if she kept it!
PeMpDAbraa	Love...it is my most beautiful of feelings..but only true love. Isn't that why most people strive to find the "one"? You love the baby, you live your spouse, boyfriend, friend, parents, family. Love, simple yet complex. When you held that baby wasn't it amazing...to have the baby melt into you!! Ahhh Congrats.|`|QY10Hmq7aa	When I gave birth to my son and held him for the first time.|`|Z0Vds9oCaa	Saving a baby rabbit.|`|RMHOO0Mhaa	Riding my horse on a gorgeous day|`|gb9ERmHPaa	Congratulations man!  Isn't life beautiful?  Getting released from federal prison after doing 3.  Being locked up is nothing anybody should go through.  It is such a waste of life.  Every day free people take life for granted, and don't truely appreciate what they have.  I'm about to go back to college in the summer, I can hardly wait.  Life is beautiful.|`|3ad05f51839ba1e01125f9c9a1ac29a9aa	when my daughter was born...z|`|U7d3Ft9baa	When my small brother was born and I held him in my arms for the first time.|`|8SN2zssxaa	LOVE    ~bye~|`|cdf9bde60acfd0a622e4bbdccdc9e515aa	When my boyfriend finally told me he loved me.|`|c68XWGltaa	my first donkey punch|`|wylAjpfmaa	when people tell me that i have a verry special gift from God and that I should use it wisely|`|1gJ92tJaaa	finding out my girlfriend is pregnant!|`|WyjRm10jaa	When death & living..  is nothing..|`|7pJ8S0Liaa	I would have to say LOVE!|`|Y4B5CYKFaa	love|`|sJNoTGQVaa	we have a completely different opinion of beautiful...

yS61H04haa	NONE, there is no other band out there that is even remotely tool-ish. Sadly. but that is what makes Tool so wonderful and unique.      *****Z.E.R.O. has lost his damn mind if he thinks that Static X and Disturbed is remotely close to Tool. And Rammstien? Seriosuly! I don't think he has ever even listened to Tool. And SLIPKNOT..... oMG...    Deftones MAYBE , but only because Chino has such a great voice.|`|lGzQtEH7aa	Here are some bands similar to Tool:    Nine Inch Nails  Marilyn Manson  Deftones  Slipknot  Mudvayne  Ministry  Godflesh  Static-X  Society Burning  Rammstein  Fear Factory  Disturbed  Lamb of God|`|rFBypeEfaa	Nobody's mentioned them yet, but the only band I've run across that seemed to have a similar vibe is Helmet.    Particularly in some of the drum/bass interactions...|`|8Xg9op2Iaa	Hammer  Machine  Power Saw  Industrial Sander    Great bands...|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Pelican  http://www.myspace.com/pelican|`|16t0eV0Uaa	Well Im not sure you know them or not, but you should really check out Porcupine tree, one of my favorite bands..

I would say Dream Theater simply because of the progressive style.     as for a similar sound to Tool, they are a very original band who in my opinion are unmatched in what they do|`|bWI43goqaa	Bad Religion-http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2ko-TytN...      well,kinda        good luck man!    rock out!!!!|`|52efeea3c9eae1de26f16355e12a7d09aa	Puscifer, Deftones, Riverside, Porcupine Tree, Rishloo, Fair to Midland, Peach, The Mars Volta, Opeth, Nine Inch Nails.|`|NOoEI13uaa	Yeah.

mQk1c6UAaa	I'm impressed.  Another love triangle gone bad?  Actually, I've had accounts suspended after only one violation and on the other hand I had an account with a black and white pic of a woman from 1957 that I found in a shoe box of my dad's that had 100+ violations before they suspended her account.  RIP Mildred.  The woman's real name was Shirley but I thought Mildred suited her better.|`|rLP9wjPtaa	sounds like trouble, start a new account, and try to keep the trolls off of if it...|`|iIWWeD7Taa	Oh man... it was nice knowin' ya.

Did you accidentally spend your lucky penny?|`|8RNPlSAfaa	seems like you got a troll :(    but it's not the number of violations you get, it's the amount of people who report you at one time!!!    You can collect violations and not get suspended.. but say if 5 people report one question you might get suspended. Also you are more likely to get suspended for asking questions than for answering!!!    so if you have a reporter troll who has multiple accounts you'd already be suspended..    I've gotten a lot of violations recently myself, which leads me to believe that the forum people are out reporting again.    They chat amongst each other and decide which questions to collectively report!!!    In their own words "they police sections"|`|k8QlPisUaa	If i can create an account on a Friday and not use it at all. Then the following Monday sign in and be thanked with 1 visiting point, click on my profile and be told my account is suspended, I'd say 0+ violations is possible.|`|cmw591woaa	so,should we be infiltrating the forum and collecting our own data?|`|Ef83kV3Qaa	That's got to be some kind of record.

ebxwADDcaa	im very bored...i just tabbed out scales and chords for someone learning to play guitar and it took a half hour, thats how bored i am.    MA -EVH by a long shot|`|ONWCXzUMaa	never bored as long as my mind is ticking so am I  MQ even thought I like both I'm into Steve Vai right now.  take care  dave|`|OI29tkSoaa	Yes I'm absolutely bored  Eddie Van Halen|`|8Xg9op2Iaa	Randy Johnson... Whaaaaa?    (This is a yes)|`|jXXRf7Hyaa	im so bored.....=)    MQ: Eddie Van Halen all the jaevla way!    edit:    im so bored im kinda wanna go to sleep but im too hyper and i cant|`|TApbD3XXaa	Most certainly.    MQ: Eddie VanH|`|FY8YYZgBaa	Yep. MQ: Steve|`|CTQNPj56aa	no... Im watching Heroes  Eddie all the way  c'mon though I could of thought of 50 better guitarists to "spice-up" those choices|`|3yoP1SNQaa	MANY PEOPLE WHO DON'T KNOW STEVE VAI WELL WOULD PICK EVH.    If your're a guitar player, you would definitely understand that.     You definitly can't match EVH's guitar theory with Vai's. Vai's knowledge is VAST! He is able to know what scales to use to create certain feelings or cultural tones in his pieces. Did I say that Vai's knowledge of guitar theory is vast?     Skills wise, it's Vai too.   Look at Vai's pieces. They're way much more complex than EVH's. Honestly, Eruption is no biggie. EVH can never play as clean as Vai. Vai is simple inhuman.     So it's VAI  for me.      PEOPLE WHO SAY EVH IS BETTER SHOULD REALLY CHECK OUT VAI AND READ MORE ABOUT HIM.    ENLIGHTEN YOURSELF (:|`|pLSxCUUsaa	I'm so bored I actually did my school work....  Go Eddie|`|1vCoaf08aa	Hmm, I'll say Eddie.    But Steve Vai is great as well.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	BOREDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD|`|RtG5Iarbaa	Definately.

GkE1J8kGaa	Yea when I was in high school I was hooking school in my house, my mom came home from work early and it was around 11am so i just hopped in my bed and pretending to be sleep.

I got tired of getting in trouble so if I heard them get up, I would pretend that I fell asleep with the TV on...lol. It worked everytime. ?|`|PlVh12fpaa	yes, i have.  i "pretend" that i slept in the morning. because i didn't finish my homework.|`|QJu73ISQaa	Yes, many times!

Jokes on her ;)|`|4D6xfsnlaa	Yes, many reasons. One time my mom wouldn't let me watch a horror movie cuz I'd be scared so I pretended that I was asleep but my hand covering my eyes so she couldn't see that my eyes were actually open and I could see the TV.|`|mMcrqP6caa	yeah so I could avoid conflict.|`|8ea7bf093a6acfbb69fa32bf5c76d57baa	Yes!  Me and my partner were arguing and I really wanted to, but I didn't want him to know I was enjoying it, so I played like I was asleep.|`|PrLcyuAJaa	yeah so I can listen to other people... I am nosey and plus I want to know if anyone talks about me.... i am kinda paranoid too|`|uKSsXz2iaa	Yes, so this woman wouldn't try talking to me. It bit me in the ***, because she stole a bunch of stuff out of my closet.|`|58KUMpF0aa	Many times.    So I could fool other people.

I'm not Jewish but I think it's a bit stupid to mock something as tragic as what happened to the Jewish, even if its a joke.|`|UPYLwE8taa	When Brian was singing a song and he said "The USA will treat you right unless you're black or gay or Cherokee." I took offense to that because I'm a black guy and I live in the USA.

TwFlxckRaa	Wow..that IS a hard one. I really do love Dog Fashion Disco,  But what I love even more is the fact that you actually know who these two bands are!  Unbelievable.    Cheers,    Christina   here's me....  http://www.myspace.com/mikepattonisgod    (LATER)Yeah, we've seen Melt Banana a few times. They toured with Mr. Bungle a lot. Other bands I've been listening to a lot recently is Sleepytime Gorilla Museum, Daughters, Black Dice, Trevor Dunn's Trio Convulsant, and an Italian experimental band called Zu. I think you'd definitely enjoy them. Ya know, who I'm really disappointed with recently is The Dillinger Escape Plan! They used to be unbef*ckinglievable, and now they just sound like a bunch of emo douchebags.  So sad.|`|1vCoaf08aa	Polkadot Cadaver.    Personal preference.|`|EWE5BMLKaa	Dog fashion disco, while they were more "Nu-metal" than PC they had that slight originality (Even if it was completely "Influenced" by Mike Patton) where as PC are now trying really really hard to sound like Mr. Bungle.    Oh, also... The Altar Boys are also better than PC

The real trick in dieting is real simple. Eat lots of Fruits ,Veggies, Lean Meats, NO Breads, Sugars, Carbs, stay away from soda's, energy drinks. Drinking more water EVERYDAY also helps control appetite. Consult a Doctor FIRST. I can not stress that enough. Walking helps burn calories. Grapefruit juice is good, Cranberry juice is good. Grape Juice is good. Pomagranite Juice is good too. The real stuff no concentrates, read the labels on sugar amounts. Good Luck.

sTwTXixXaa	Yes, not all but SOME.  But that's not saying much, because SOME video games, movies, tv shows magazines, basically the media, has a negative influence on today's youth.  Society teaches us that nice guys/girls finish last.  Being a gentlemen or nice kid seems as if it is frowned upon.  If we continue this vicious cycle no telling what our future will bring.|`|6fxr3VBGaa	who's youth not my youth|`|4DzaDa3Uaa	Music in general is in the toilet these days.|`|42a3494c4c91e3621ec36d45d2b2ef4faa	better than rock    talkin bout destroying other ppls property, doin lines of cocaine, commiting suicide and having orgies, oh and dont forget satanism|`|BOMu89Ttaa	no I do not...!    Because on radios, on TV are clean verisons of songs.   The only time you'll hear dirty verison of rap songs is in the internet and on a CD (which says parental advisor)    Parents should be responsible to what their kids listen to and what to do and how to take action.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	no but   actual drugs  actual discrimination  bad parents  and violence   just to name a few do its all out there and ignoring it doesn't make it not real|`|ebvNEvj1aa	Today's mainstream rap? Yes, these kids think they're so cool... :| (I'm referring to Lil Wayne, Jim Jones, etc...) 90s/80s rap...I find that empowering/positive (at least for me).

Also, heavy metal plays a negative roll as well. Not all of one genre of music is bad for the youth.|`|983fe5ad295bcdda0b7056d9ebad8b93aa	No, instead of being stubborn. Listen to actual rap, not morons like lil wayne and what not. Listen to Lupe Fiasco, and you will actually like it.|`|aqsUNGfEaa	Yes I do think it has a negative influence on them...kids look up to older people and mimmick what they do because they think they'll be cool if they do.|`|AjPUD3Jsaa	ugh.     yes and no. I dont really feel like typing out an entire dissertation but my answer is yes and no..my reasoning is rather complicated though. But..it has to do with the fact that the never ending success stories that come from SOME rappers glorifying sex, drugs, killing, selling dope..    they made it big by living that life and the cycle continues because some people actually look up to them. The young women look at the video vixens and aspire to be them..becuase they're the type of women being praised by the successful men. Thus, instilling thoughts of you have to look like this to get a 'baller'..or even that baller men are the only men to go after. smh..    BUT at the same time..their parents need to take responsibility for allowing a young impressionable mind to listen/look at such things..its complicated but all I know is..its a sad cycle..|`|621f72648143f2ae1fe5d28f6e876b28aa	Unfortunately yes, I also think that it has been talked about so much that rappers are trying to change some of the negativity that rap music has brought to the world.|`|EuK1QgYeaa	Heck yeah!

gM03eKTJaa	That's the same as asking how long a piece of string is. But the quick answer is, for you, as a beginner, would only 19 (below the break). In primary school, you'll probably only go up to high C - 33 notes. But after that, you wouldn't really ever need to go past the next C, so 45. It is, however, possible to go further.|`|8cDd70dSaa	38 in a normal range
lgg7DLy9aa	Conventionally, there are 32 notes the saxophone can finger. With an F  key, which comes on most intermediate and pro horns, the range can easily be extended to 33. By altering the throat, the altissimo range can be achieved, which makes the range approximately 41 or so, but this is an extremely advanced technique.    your friend shouldn't have to worry about any of the extremes, (s)he should just be playing from around G to G or so. Tell (him/her) to pick up a beginning method book, as this will help develop her skill|`|8cDd70dSaa	32 in a normal range...Didn't I just answer a clarinet-related question for you? Try Googling some fingering charts.|`|0rfnAfeIaa	Well, depending on whether or not you have an F  key, you can hit from low, below the staff Bb to F or F . Which is either 24 or 25 notes, depending on that F . Hope I could help!    Of course, if your friend just started, he or she won't get to the super low Bb or the amazingly high F until after a year or so.
493f81eda6065f722ebb134ce91919eaaa	This is difficult to question answer. The amount of wood that woodchucks would chuck on a given day varies greatly with the individual woodchuck. According to a Wall Street Journal article, New York State wildlife expert Richard Thomas found that a woodchuck could chuck around 35 cubic feet of dirt in the course of digging a burrow. Thomas reasoned that if a woodchuck could chuck wood, he would chuck an amount equal to 700 pounds.    Some say it depends on three factors:        * The woodchuck's desire to chuck said wood.         * The woodchuck's need to chuck the aforementioned wood.         * The woodchuck's ability to chuck the wood.     Others say:        * He would chuck, he would, as much as he could, if a woodchuck could chuck wood.         * If he could chuck wood, the woodchuck would chuck as much as he could!         * A woodchuck would chuck as much wood as a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.         * A woodchuck would chuck all the wood that the woodchuck would chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.         * If a woodchuck could chuck wood, he would and should chuck wood. But if woodchucks can't chuck wood, they shouldn't and wouldn't chuck wood. Though were I a woodchuck, and I chucked wood, I would chuck wood with the best woodchucks that chucked wood.         * If a woodchuck could chuck wood, then s/he'd chuck all the wood, s/he'd chuck and chuck and chuck and chuck, if a woodchuck could chuck wood.         * It would chuck the amount of wood that she sells seashells on the seashore divided by how many pickles Peter Piper picks.         * One quarter of a sycamore if you give him a quarter for every quarter of the sycamore he cut.         * It might depend on how many female woodchucks were present. Or, it could depend on whether the woodchuck's mother-in-law was around or not. If she was, he'd be chucking all day. If not, he'd be watching the football game.         * Some maintain that woodchucks could not and would not chuck wood at all.         * It depends on how good his dentures are!         * A woodchuck, would chuck, as much wood, as a woodchuck, could chuck, If a woodchuck could chuck wood. But unfortunately, woodchucks do not chuck wood.         * About 5.72 fluid litres of wood         * About as many boards as the Mongol hoards would hoard if the Mongol hordes did hoard boards.         * Um....... 23????         * Tons. More than you can count. Honestly. No one can chuck more would than a woodchuck.         * If the woodchucks name was Maurice, then it could chuck all the wood that it wants to. However, if its name is Frank, no chucking would be for it.         * Due to the average size of a wood chuck and the general density of wood (not including cork) if a wood chuck could chuck wood it would probably get through about 6.573 pounds per day, assuming the wood chuck is functioning correctly.         * Using the formula: (W + I) * C where W = the constant of wood, which is well known to be 61, as agreed in many scientific circles. I = the variable in this equation, and stands for the word "if" from the original problem. As there are three circumstances, with 0 equaling the chance that the woodchuck cannot chuck wood, 1 being the theory that the woodchuck can chuck wood but chooses not to, and 2 standing for the probability that the woodchuck can and will chuck wood, we clearly must choose 2 for use in this equation. C = the constant of Chuck Norris, whose presence in any problem involving the word chuck must there, is well known to equal 1.1 of any known being, therefore the final part of this calculation is 1.1. As is clear, this appears to give the answer of (61 + 2) * 1.1 = (63) * 1.1 = 69.3. However, Chuck Norris' awesome roundhouse kick declares that all decimal points cannot be used in formulas such as this, and so it must be rounded to the final solution of 69 units of wood.|`|8YJhzVRKaa	a wood chuck could chuck all the wood chuck could chuck if a wood chuck could chuck wood.|`|LYkmBqRlaa	If a woodchuck could chuck wood, a woodchuck would chuck a chunk of wood|`|ZBFDXPDIaa	Reptile Boy 01 ?  you must have no life!|`|5ydqCVE2aa	as much wood as a woodchuck could if a woodcuck could chuck wood.

I think he would go crazy with the wood chuckin'. But AWWWWWWWWWWW,so sad a woodchuck can't chuck wood.|`|l9jPfPCFaa	That depends. What if he's a wood chucking junkie? A chucked wood addict? Or what if he could chuck the wood, but he was wood fiber intolerant? What if Mama Woodchuck was an overpowering control freak psycho, and made him believe that chucking wood was evil, but he couldn't resist the temptation, and did it in secret? Surely that would have a huge influence on how much he could chuck wood without the fear of getting caught?

MZuGwySRaa	It's actually a marketing strategy..You know kids will appreciate a certain character if they were familiar...for example Donald: He looks like a sailor and talks like a sailor( somehow )...but yet He's a Duck!...Imagine that as a kid..    Look at Mickey..he typically resembles a mime... basically his cartoons started as silent ones with music backdrops..And that's how he became famous!!!... These cartoon characters wouldn't have made it to stardom if it wasn't for their costumes at all.... would you like to see Mickey wearing nothing but yellow shoes?...    ewww...he will look like one of those sewer rats...hehehe|`|l9uGrfSYaa	The 1930's were a poor time back then. ..........=_=|`|n0lJ2aiAaa	donald duck was baned in sweaden cos he didnt have pants!

3zLLkLORaa	La Zimbabwe      Beno Guelbert: batera  Daro Ungaro: teclados  Diego Cano: bajo  Marcelo "Chelo" Delgado: voz  Sebastin Schachtel: guitarra        La Zimbabwe Reggae Band fue, junto con Los Pericos, los propulsores del reggae, un ritmo que apareca como "de moda" all por 1987 y que pocos crean que pudiera perdurar ms all de un verano. La moda pas; Los Pericos sobrepasaron la movida pero la Zimbabwe qued en el camino, con dos discos editados.        De regreso en 1993, tras su radicacin en Chile, Delgado decidi reciclar la banda pero no encontr el eco adecuado en el resto de sus compa?eros, todos embarcados en otros proyectos. Con Ungaro como el otro "sobreviviente" de la primera formacin, acortaron el nombre a La Zimbabwe y recuperaron gran parte de su xito con el tercer lbum, "Cuestin de honor" (1995) que los llev de gira por el interior del pas y por Latinoamrica.        En esta segunda etapa, la Zimbabwe estaba formada por Delgado (guitarra y voz), Daro Ungaro (batera), Hernn Krasnopolski (bajo), Pablo Etcheverry (teclados), Armando Avila (teclados), Alberto Morello (guitarra) y Marco Ungaro (percusin).        Vendieron 150.000 copias y fueron distinguido por la Asociacin de Cronistas del Espectculos (ACE) con el premio Mejor Album de msica pop. "Traicin a la mexicana" fue uno de los temas ms solicitados en las radios capitalinas a fines del '95. El videoclip "Loco de atar", dirigido por Jorge Rosales, fue seleccionado por la MTV dentro de los 100 mejores de su historia. Despidieron el a?o con un multitudinario show gratuito en Parque Centenario.        En 1997 presentaron "ADN", que ellos mismos describieron como ?un inicio de cero. Necesitbamos dar una vuelta de pgina y recomenzar con cosas aprendidas, pese a que seguimos transitando por el reggae ms cercano al pop? (El Cronista, 5-6-97).

AA10849618	A Keytar    Its a combination of a guitar and a keyboard, so out of those two words you get Keytar.|`|c759b39a83bf0fbd5a9716bfa074c619aa	It's some really, really, old instrument that they used back in the day.

A lot of nerds used it!                ???|`|f4aa79c3de9a0732addfb6255c9a5033aa	It's a keytar    A keytar is a keyboard or synthesizer worn around the neck and shoulders, similar to a guitar. The word keytar is a portmanteau of keyboard and guitar. Keytars allow players a greater range of movement, compared to conventional keyboards, which are placed on stands.    Originally the creation of guitarist Steve Masakowski, the keytar was commercially introduced in 1980 as the Moog Liberation. The first Liberation owner ( 1001) was Spyro Gyra keyboardist Tom Schuman (with numbers 1002, 1003, and 1004 owned by the band Devo).|`|mFNfrlQqaa	probally a keytar you stupid head

Syc0F9D8aa	Well first the name. ..like the person above mentioned, the name usually stays the same for the most part, unless the person chooses to name it something different(e.g. Byakuya's "Senbonzakura" becomes "Senbonzakura Kageyoshi"). Most bankais usually keep the same ability as shikai but with more power. So perhaps Senna could use Mirokumaru to create hundreds of small tornadoes to surround the enemy. Then once the enemy is surrounded have all the small tornadoes converge creating one gigantic tornado that engulfs the enemy. I also think it would be neat if the leaves flying around became blades that cut the enemy as they are being engulfed. As for the look I can't offer much advice, just try to make it look original. Also I would like to point out that there is a problem with the first answer. Unlike Shikai, Bankai doesn't require a phrase to activate it(Unless you consider when the user says the words "Bankai" the phrase).|`|ZIMmGqEAaa	Well the name of her zanpakut is Mirokumaru, no matter what form it's in.     Her bankai would a getsugasan, shown in http://dharmatrail.com/Images-T2/ArtPhot... because it's recognizable with monks just like her shikai is. Her command to release would be "arrive daybreak" as an opposite to original command "call forth twilight". Her Bankai would allow her to create more controlled slicing blades of wind with the bladed end vs. her original ability to create tornadoes. Also, the butt end of the spade would allow her to create impenetrable barriers of wind.

N9f5HzEWaa	Tobi is Obito and also Madara. it is kinda confusing. But me and My friend have came witht this solution Tobi is Madara in Obito's body. For all we know he is saying that he is Madara Uchiha but since his body was destroyed when back when and he could've use the jutsu that Orchimaru used to tranfer soul into another body. thus being who everr without a Uchiha Bloodline body Madara Probily found out bout Obito and took over the body. but then that is where we also got lost because when Kakashi talked about his Shirangan in the one chapter where we learn bout Obito, He (Obito) had only one good eye left cause of the boulder that was smashed on half his body. Then Obito gave his only eye to Kakashi. So Tobi's body is mostly unkown but with the fact that he knows what he knows his spirit could be Marada's. Hope that helps.|`|hBEfrv23aa	Tobi is Madara Uchiha  If you read like from chapters 380-405 that will be made clear.|`|e6YcsNQCaa	OK, this is all fake.

It's an article with a good website link list of places to watch free movies. You can watch old movie classics or new releases. They have a foreign movie list too.      I like Ovguide.com too but the problem is some of the websites they list install crap on your computer.  Just beware, not all the sites they list are clean.    I like this article because the websites on the list don't have 50 million pop-ups and you're not require to register or install something useless (like Zango) before you can watch a movie.  Saves me a lot of hassle of going through a lot of crappy sites to find some gems.    This list is all you'll need since most of these free movie websites out there get their movies from the same sources.    Enjoy!    Peter|`|vV8met2uaa	http://watch-movies-links.net/

1jpmS3M6aa	Not on your first read through, no. To be honest you should just plow into the meat of an already complex and confusing story to get the most out of it. Then on your return to the comic you can drink in all the nuances of the universe that Alan Moore created as the excerpts are much more satisfying with a prior knowledge of the events of the storyline. While not vital they really are just cool little extra pieces for you to enjoy.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	EXTRA|`|QpNckG6Iaa	Personally, I think the stuff from Under the Hood is fairly important to the storyline.

8yE2sYGeaa	Studios are interested in scripts that are not that expenive to produce to increase their profit margin.    There are some stunning scripts out there, but these tyro writers lack the wherewithal to get them to the studios and the studio is going to stick with an established writer (even iof they crank out crap)|`|l9jPfPCFaa	I have a few theories about that. One is that recently with the advances in special effects, movies have become more about the effects than the story. Sort of as if the writers envision the effects then try to write a story around that instead of using the effects to enhance the story. Another theory is that after about 100 years of making movies, the fresh ideas are finally running out (which could explain all of the recent remakes!) But what I mainly believe is that the writers have gotten away from the notion of writing a good story for the story's sake, and are mainly after ideas that will be big at the box office ($$$!).|`|xuThaCvRaa	Creativity & Intellect don't generate allot of money for the studios that produce them.

AA10382814	it's the association /perception (limited)that they have of you , don't identify with it needlessly. Forget about it.It says more about the other person, and how much they watch Seinfeld (  a classic show but as pass as the Golden Girls), than it says about you .  It's a wake up call you to start hanging out with other people, so you aren't  mistakenly cast into anybody's GC/scapegoat/nebbish slot they want to put you in  their life 'show'.   time to say "later!"...    Who are they like? that might put in perspective for you - you shouldn't think more highly of them than you do of yourself. their idea of you seems outdated.     Sounds limited and a bit "damning with faint praise"/and "a dubious honour" kind of thing... a  tepid backhanded putdown. Walk away from it!!  Hang out with other people , and i can promise that they will have different perceptions of you .

AA11608168	Let's see here..i'm going to give main points:    -Amber, Daniel, Jana and Kevin all break into the pawn shop that bought Mrs. C's ring to find proof that they did buy it from her and they did in fact find a receipt to a jewler for it.  Amber also lost her phone in this break-in.    -Phyllis met with Brad (once again) in a bar.  Brad set it up so Nick would hear that Phyllis was trying to plot again to keep Nick and Sharon apart.  Nick gets very mad and tells her that she is being unreal and the sharades needs to stop.  Phyllis promises to give it up.      -Sharon has been up in the Abbott cabin since last week trying to do some soul searching.  In the mean time Jack goes to check on her and talk to her about the divorce papers he had just received and she said yes it was over.  After Jack leaves, Brad shows up confessing that he still is in love with her.  She tells him that she will have feelings for him always, but Nick is the only one she truly loves.  Brad then leaves and his car breaks down.    -Gloria has several offers to sell her stock to Jabot.  She gives in to Victor and his money.  He then tells Jill he bought them for  her to take the company away from Jack. -- Glo is still in the slammer.    -Ester accepts a marriage proposal from Roger (who is after her money set up by Clint)    -Billy/Lilly/Chloe/Cane- Paternity still has yet to come out about the baby.  Lilly and Billy are becoming closer and closer (he just asked if she would go away to the cabin on Valentines Day -- She has to think about it)     -Victor wants Abby to call him Dad.  Brad is furious over this.  Vic also wants Brad to give up his board seat..he also refusess to let Vic take over his life.  There will be a "war" between the two.  While Abby is torn between the two.  Brad wants her to move in with him, but she wants Daddy's MONEY..so she stays at the ranch.  Everyone is still thinking that Vic is trying to REPLACE Sabrina and the baby with Ash and Abby...this could very well be!     -Noah and Eden go to a skating party, but there really isn't one and sneak off together (they conned Michael and Phyllis into believing there was) they go off onto a frozen pond and Noah falls in.......Eden runs for help and Brad overhears Noah and saves him...now no one can find Brad! In the mean time Sharon is pouring her heart out over a letter to Nick (which she is just venting, and will throw it in the wood pile to burn)  Noah is in the hospital and Nick is furious with everyone for making such poor decisions.  Once Noah is out of the woods Nick heads to the cabin to tell Sharon.  Phyllis is sooo upset that she asks Jack to stay with Noah..she is going after her hubby....ALL OF THIS IN A SNOW STORM!   Nick reaches the Cabin to a surprised Sharon and tells her the bad news..as they are leaving, a ranger comes and tells them they are stuck till at least morning the roads are closed..as the same for Phyills as she is turned around and not allowed to go to the cabin.    -Colleen starts freaking cause Brad was supposed to meet them for dinner and he hasn't called or emailed.  She goes to JT for help.  Nothing found yet.    -Eden and Michael have a BROTHERLY/SISTER moment as they hug...she breaks down.  She has also told Jana at this point that she does like Noah and he was her first kiss!    That is up till yesterdays show.  Hope this helps!|`|jCHcjJ9Baa	This is a great site     http://www.young-restless.com/|`|2kpr2arRaa	Y&R offical site    http://www.cbs.com/daytime/the_young_and...|`|b95adf9df97c91be72d1af840c313197aa	i go to www.young-restless.com for transcript form, if you don't mind reading....they are foreign, so US watchers can read the day in advance as a spoiler

Patrick does...and leaves them in the OR.  -Monica, Liz, Matt, are stable...Leyla flat lines....  -Ethan, a con guy shows up, and tries to rob Luke  -Johnny and Maxie are stuck in old garage....drinking beer   -Jax makes it back to GH only to find out the place is on lockdown  -Lucky makes his way into GH after finding out Liz was infected..totally dissing Sam in the process...  -Claudia tries to tell Sonny that AZ shot Kate, but passes out...AZ makes it out of the boardroom and into Claudia's ICU room...he vows to make her and Ric pay..  -A mysterious person takes one of the balls from the OR.

Patrick, Sam, Spinelli, and Jason are in the middle of it, at the hospital, trying to rescue people and sort things out.  Robin is still suffering from PPD and is in denial about it, even though she can barely bring herself to pick up her baby.  Carly is throwing a benefit at the hospital, in Michael's name, to help kids who have suffered head trauma.  Sonny, Edward Q, Tracy, Claudia, Anthony Z, Trevor, Ric, Kate, Lulu, Connie, and Nadine are trapped in the boardroom b/c the hospital has been quarantined and the biotoxins have escaped into the boardroom, so they sealed it off to try and prevent further contamination.  Liz and Monica have been exposed to the biotoxin and have become ill.  So did Matt.  Maxie and Johnny are trapped in a garage due to a snow storm.  Nik keeps thinking he's seeing Emily and is afraid his tumor is back, when really, it's an Em look-alike walking around the hospital.  Kate knows that Claudia is responsible for hiring Devlin, b/c she found one of Jerry's dvd's, but she collasped before she could tell Sonny.  Claudia knows that Anthony can walk and was responsible for shooting Kate, but she also collasped before she could tell Sonny.  Jax was called out of town so he doesn't know about the hospital crisis yet.  I think that about covers it.|`|NGNeT3rYaa	Basically they have been starting off the biotoxin storyline. A new guy, Ethan showed up at Luke's casino to rob him.Jason has been forced to help the FBI bring down Sonny or risk Spinelli going to federal prison for life.Claudia has been runnig around not so secretly watching dvds that incriminate her in Michaels shooting. Claudia knows her dad shot Kate and was going to tell but passes out.|`|7XM4QJiuaa	http://abc.go.com/daytime/
hOIWPsoxaa	If his bass is heavy/expensive, I would recommend getting a wide suede strap. They are comfortable which is very important! I should really take my own advice actually! Ha ha!|`|k0EIC2kaaa	They're fairly interchangeable. Some straps are wider, and these are often good if the bass is a bit heavier. The staff in the guitar store will be able to steer you in the right direction.|`|dWj3SnrSaa	Well first comes design of course.  All straps fit guitars, and basses, but you really should look more at design.  They're pretty much interchangable...  Also length, makesure, if he plays low, that it can go low, and if he plays high, make sure its not too long, they're adjustable, but you can get shorter and longer ones.
qAfnWKQCaa	Being in the right place at the right time. Being in the city where the new music craze begins at the time the new music scene begins.    Examples:  Chuck Berry - Memphis, 1955  The Ramones - New York City, 1977  Nirvana - Seattle, 1990 (about, I guess)    Right now the only way you could get a little successful is to move to a big city and ride the last of the indy/emo/alternative wave. Or you could just move to a city and play what ever the next big music craze is going to be and hope all modern music crashes within the next year.|`|f9yE6qAuaa	Hahahahah When I saw this Question before you said Ex, GNR I was gonna say study how GNR was. That's funny that you suggested them. You have to be at the right place at the right time and be original cause there's so much genretic  BS nowadays. GNR became so famous cause they were dangerous, spontaneous, Original, Sexy, had awesome different sounds from that time, Had great lyrics, Axl was the best Frontman for a rock band  imo, mad energy.  It's different in these times cause when was the last cool band that was new that was as Famous as GNR was. No one I could think of. IN this day in time.     Now it's all about whats that so call corporate look  Who you know  what city your in  Music these days aren't even based on talent.     Back in the day it was which  music scene you came from and if that place was hot at the time.|`|4ObhfxoIaa	I guess it has a lot to do with image nowadays.

Pure luck.|`|0NQL7yRPaa	cause they made their own luck and drugs told them what to do|`|K0jFAytUaa	Funny thing about Guns and Roses  I can't really explain everything that made Guns and Roses famous because then I would not be able to post this comment  Guns and Roses got famous because Slash was good at drawing and met Izzy because he saw one of his pictures. I am not sure how he met axl, but steve adler was a long time friend. Well they got famous one night because they were playing live at a bar and someone saw them. They had record deals flowing through their door because of publicity from the bar. Then they settled one deal with Geffen Records and went on tours and made albums until they were really famous. They also had ....."creative" ways to enhance their cd covers and songs, but I'll leave that for you to research.

Fn2PdDzfaa	I'm a cancerian and well, my guy's a leo too.....and i dont think you are alone in this case.....It so happens that its me who always texts him first or call him 2 say hi, but I guess leos like it when they know that they are cared for and loved.....and they love being in the center of attention. But u know....deep inside, they are loving and playful in nature....You just gotta get to know them better and remember, u are dealing with a leo, and lions love lavish tributes. When leo sees that youre trying hard to earn their affection, theyll let you back into their life.  Sure enough, you should be hurt by his ignorance and non-expressiveness, which is mostly coz of his ego. But I think he really loves you. Just dont lose hope, and keep on trying, and keep in contact, that way you can win back his heart. Just dont let go, coz leos are great lovers. You'll be lucky if you win! :)  I'm not that much into horoscopes, but i know these well enough through experience.

c3vd6UvNaa	Wrong, wrong, and wrong.  No villain has been confirmed for a third Batman film, a script has not even been written, Christopher Nolan has not even officially signed on to direct the third film.  So far all that has happened are a few meetings with Nolan and Goyer batting around story ideas and working on a first draft.  THAT'S IT.  In fact, Christopher Nolan probably won't even direct the next Batman film right away.    So the next time you hear someone saying that the Riddler has been "confirmed" for a third film, or what the movie's title is, or that it's being filmed right now, laugh in their faces and walk away.|`|dpSTgytfaa	As long as Nolan is director, Robin will never be in his movies.

RtG5Iarbaa	Well, when I first started chords were like hell. They hurt like a b*tch. So I learnt a few easy songs that don't have chords in certain parts [Hypnotize - SOAD, Heart Shaped Box - Nirvana, Nothing Else Matters - Metallica], and got my fingers used to the fretboard, alternating fingers and started to develop some callouses. I played everyday for over an hour, so I my fingers began getting stiffer after a week or two. After your fingers harden up a bit, chords should be easier. It might take a bit for your hands to get used to stretching out to reach all the notes, but it's all worth it in the end. =)  Just a word of advice, don't favor any fingers. Make sure that when you play you use all of them. I always forgot my last finger and while the rest of mine had callouses, I couldn't do some chords cause that one was soft and hurt like crazy.    Good luck|`|1vCoaf08aa	Basic chords and basic scales.    Master that, and move on to something a little harder.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	practice on chords and getting your finger work down pat...!    No point learning any songs without knowing the basics :)|`|ebxwADDcaa	ok, new kid to the guitar, i got this.     alright the first thing you need to know is you should probably take lessons. it might not be exactly what you want to hear or anything, but teaching yourself is basically the same thing as taking lessons, only you are taking the long road to finding out what is written down already. But, if you do not take lessons, I would at least reccomend following along in a music book series or becoming a member to a website that teaches you through videos.     there are several things you should learn when starting out, my first lesson I learned A-G major chords, i reccomend you do the same.   examples:  E major:    |----0-----------------------------|  |----0----------------------------|  |----1-----------------------------|  |----2-----------------------------|  |----2----------------------------|  |----0-----------------------------|    also, after you learn all the major chords, learn the minor chords as well. those are the most important of the chords, and you will probably use them most often.     there are other types of chords too...like the barre chord. it is a pretty easy concept for an experienced guitarist, but beginners have a hard time with them. to play these you have to hold down all 6 strings with your index finger and then place your other fingers on the other frets needed to complete the chord...example below, shows the difference between major and minor barre chords as well.      ......F(maj)............A flat (minor)  |----1-----------------4------------|  |----1-----------------4------------|  |----2-----------------4------------|  |----3-----------------6------------|  |----3-----------------6------------|  |----1-----------------4------------|    Also, there are power chords, one of the easiest chords to do out there. here are a couple examples:    Both G, just different octaves.  |---------------------------------|  |------------8---------------------|  |------------7---------------7------|  |--5--------5---------------5--------|  |--5------------------5-------------|  |--3------------------3-------------|  the ones with 2 note chord are basically a simplifies way to play it...you dont really need the third notw, it is just an octave and adds power.     Something you will always need to know are scales. these are one of the most important things you need to know. again, you should just learn the major and minor shapes for now but definitely learn more in the future...there are hundreds of scales, im sure you wont get bored.     G Major Scale  |-----------------------------------5-...  |------------------------------5-7-8--...  |---------------------------4-5-7----|  |-------------------4-5-7------------|  |-----------3-5-7--------------------|  |---3-5-7----------------------------|    G Minor Scale  |-----------------------------------5-...  |------------------------------4-6-8--...  |-------------------------3-5-7------|  |-----------------3-5-7--------------|  |---------3-5-6----------------------|  |-3-5-6------------------------------|    both of those shapes are universal, for the most part.     lastly, you need little warm-up exercises. these are little things i like to do when I warm up everyday that will improve your picking speed, control and other important areas.     d=downstroke  u=upstroke  dududududududududududududu  |-----------------------------------12...  |-----------------------------1234----...  |----------------------1234-----------...  |---------------1234------------------...  |--------1234-------------------------...  |-1234--------------------------------...      d.u.d.u..d.u.d.u.d...u.d.u   |---------4---------------4-----------...  |-4-5-7----7-5-4-5-7----7-5-----------...  for that last one, make sure you emphesize the upstroke on the 4.     d u d u d u d u d u d u d u d u d  |1-2-3-4-2-3-4-5-3-4-5-6-4-5-6-7...and so on, then back down.    anyway, i hope you enjoyed all that. it took me upwards of a half hour to tab it all up and type, etc.|`|Y90iPn9qaa	I would say keep practicing.

9HqY9Mtlaa	the only question i can answer is the demon question. the "demons" is the trip that the people experience after taking the drug. the "demon" is basically the drug and it represent what it does to people. the ones who did not kill themselves were killed by the ex soldier guy with muscle. for example the sexy girl who was killed in the alley. i interpreted that he was the demon on drugs while she was just trying to run away.     In a nutshell... the movie was stupid. the previews made me think that max payne was going against a supernatural. not people on drugs.

You really have a great voice to use!!|`|1SBundNFaa	you have a very nice voice. honestly, american idol is way overated. it has gotten very dull and standard. if you learn to play an instrument or if you already play one, i suggest you do that and come up with your own music.|`|Do0AOAIYaa	DO IT!!!!!!!!!!|`|hWuS3AlLaa	You have a nice voice, it's needs a bit of training but very nice.

As for American Idol, you never know what they are looking for. But it wouldn't hurt to try.|`|i1T8yKhpaa	omg love ur voice do it do it|`|3yNh5jO8aa	beware of creeps. you're too young to be on youtube!    EDIT: I'm confused.

K0jFAytUaa	You could always just bar the chord and when I say that I mean lay your whole finger across the lowest fret in the chord and finger it from there. As far as lengthening your fingers you will just need to play more and stretch your hand regularly. I would suggest getting a hand exerciser so you could be more flexible and reach those harder to reach notes. Just keep trying and soon you'll get it.|`|RtG5Iarbaa	Are you double jointed?  My fingers are and sometimes they lock if I'm trying to play notes with my pinkie.    Not sure if thats what your talking about though|`|ebxwADDcaa	stretch.     honestly, all that really needs to happen is more practice.     or you have incredibly short fingers...thats what you made it sound like.     oh, i just realized, this might sound weird but you could be left handed guitarist and you just dont know it. my little brother was like that for a while, he had trouble playing and someone gave him a left handed guitar and he did a lot better...of course he had to re-learn the instrument, and ended up quitting, but at least he found his problem|`|sJNoTGQVaa	ive been playing guitar for quite some time and actually have played in lots of gigs and stuff, and I play powerchords, i started out playing them with my pointing finger and my pinkie, and then stretched my hand as far across the fret board as possible for 5 minutes a day, and now its much easier to play them|`|SazPJ3iKaa	never had this problem sorry... it just hurt my finger tips.. but they didnt lock up.|`|JxZLpmSwaa	i had the same problem when i first was learning cuz i was learning on acoustic which is even harder when it comes to that!!  my teacher told me 2 do some excercises were you play an open note then the 1st finger, then 2nd, then 3rd, then 4th, then 3rd finger, 2nd, 1st, and open.  i go up and down the each of those notes on each string and it gradually gets easier.  now its fine 4 me and i do those warmups every time i play before i get into my songs and stuff :)  good choice of instrument!!  very fun!!  (yes i just mastered yellow submarine by the beatles!!)|`|NnaJaDJoaa	Try playing the guitar in drop D or Lower
7hrOjPwjaa	Your account can get suspended by picking up violations. Violations are breaches of the Community Guidelines and you can get suspended from just one offence (if its serious enough) Or it may take 20 or so less serious offenses to get a suspension.    You do have the right to appeal any violation that you might get should you feel that you have not violated the Community Guidelines.    You can get violations from either answering OR questioning.    Its weird but the term 'suspension' kinda implies that your account gets reinstated after a time but thats not what happens. If your account gets 'suspended' then it is permanent and you wont be able to ask or answer questions with that account again.|`|sEUnAmv6aa	yes, answering and you never get it back.|`|Nh2xYpiWaa	Both.

ZyGyDLsDaa	Brighton Beach Memoirs (1986)  IMDb synopsis:  Eugene, a young teenage Jewish boy, recalls his memoirs of his time as an adolescent youth. He lives with his parents, his aunt, two cousins, and his brother, Stanley, whom he looks up to and admires. He goes through the hardships of puberty, sexual fantasy, and living the life of a poor boy in a crowded house.
1li4vbVoaa	There was to be a sequel about a few years ago, not long after Freddy Vs Jason was release, and they were to add in Michael Myers too but obviously they've changed their minds.    I was so lookin forward to it, because i loved that movie and Jason, Freddy and Michael Myers are the best monsters ever created.    I know that Halloween 2 and a remake of Nightmare on ELM ST are on the cards along with the new Friday The 13TH movie out in two weeks, can't wait.|`|dpSTgytfaa	Not unless New Line Cinema, who owns both franchises, changes their minds.     Nov 2007 (same time as Halo got cancelled)  New Line Cinema announces that any plans for a sequel to FVJ were cancelled and all rumors of other spoof fights (Jason vs Michael Meyers and such) are not real.      Originally, there was a interesting plan to make this a all out slasher fight in hell: Jason, Freddy, Pin head, Meyers, chucky, leatherface, and others. Whoever won in paired off fights would still get sequels. whoever lost was dead for good.|`|XCVFEAC8aa	so far, no!    Now that Platinum Dunes is taking on FRIDAY THE 13TH and A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, could they be thinking about a sequel to FREDDY VS JASON?    No, we havent really thought about doing FREDDY VS JASON, he explains, I just dont have a handle on how wed do that movie. I dont know exactly what Freddy [Krueger] is going to be yet, and until I know what Freddy is, I cant commit until I know who is playing Freddy and how that pans out. But we havent thought about that at all. This is the first time Ive thought about it at all.    ,but it's possible and i hope it happens!|`|jgho4hBCaa	Doubtful, at least right now.  They got the Friday the 13th reboot coming out next weekend, then if that does good, they already want to do a sequel to that.  But not before shooting and completing the Nightmare on Elm. Street reboot.|`|G4h6eUjiaa	Well i looked on youtube about that stuff and i saw it was supposed to come out in 2009 if there even going to make one but i don't think so lol|`|ttZuCasbaa	yeh there is.

zewRBWE7aa	Sound Forge is just a 2-track editor. While it's an excellent choice for tweaking your stereo mix, it won't separate your tracks.    As for a multitrack program, I'm a big fan of Sonar (but that costs money - what's your budget?). Audacity is free and Reaper is a steal at $50, so you might start there.|`|PD85QwlJaa	Any of them.    You only have one mouse ergo trying to raise one level while dropping another is quite impossible.  Most will allow you to click record and then record your mixer movements.

gSS0tKvmaa	a song could mean whatever you want it to...its what you take away from the lyrics...you have to sort of look at it like a poem but i guess il tell you what it means to me    well the first verse where hes talking about closing the blinds and solutions hes talking about breaking up with his girlfriend.    then when hes talking about the sun setting and the shadow of the day the sun would be her and the shadow would be his memories of their relationship    the cards and flowers are him trying to get her back - she might be leaving town im not sure    and then he continues with talking about the memories      hope this helps :]|`|5b3CJ0dBaa	From the lyrics it looks like someone is thinking of/has already committed suicide.

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	The movie is very similar, in my opinion, to one called Beethoven (1992) with Charles Grodin. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103786/  "Barely escaping from dognappers, an adorable puppy named Beethoven adopts the unsuspecting Newton family -- and promptly grows up into 185 pounds of romping, drooling, disaster-prone St. Bernard! Unfortunately, even after proving his canine credentials to mom and the kids, the heroic hound gets nowhere with uptight dad, George. But when a beastly veterinarian makes Beethoven the target of an unspeakable animal experiment, George becomes the only hope for saving the Newton's furriest family member."|`|4x2KMVbBaa	My Dog Skip....beloved dog and tragedy  Also,  Where the Red Fern Grows  Lassie  Old Yeller  Benji

AA11710920	Not sure if "I" would say they're the greatest, but they are most certainly badass-- if not, one of the MOST badass hardcore punk bands of the genre (while being also one of the most overlooked for possible stereotypically-ignorant reasons).|`|DibFrwxlaa	I like pre-Rollins Black Flag or Circle Jerks better.

bribxhsdaa	DOOM    I think a lot of MURS's hype is built on 9th Wonder's production and the fact that he's like the middle ground for Underground MC's. He's not super obscure  to the point where it irritates people when his name gets dropped but he's just marketable enough that he's likeable by mainstream fans with a passing interest in underground.    Plus as Metal Fingers, DOOM has never missed a beat (No pun intended). All of the special herbs (even the collabo CD with Grimm)    DOOM's method is second to few. Especially cause he's managed to stay glued to the MPC 2K and keep his beats solid..Considering guys like Da Vinci (SOS) are using 25k's and 4k's    Doom has a lot more underground classics too.    IMO Vaudeville Villain is just as good if not better than the majority of MURS's album...cept Felt 2 with Slug.(Which doesn't really count)|`|cRwYEyBJaa	DOOM all capitals no trick spelling!|`|RWd8L91xaa	MURS.....|`|TgN4DdZxaa	murs all the way hes so originall...and to meeh mf doom sounds like odb|`|cs692mzXaa	ill nino, Doom lip synced alot of his concerts.|`|WW9AZDHUaa	easy my personal choice is...

The fact that you don't lover well does she love you? She probably came from an unstable past where the male figure was not present, now that shes found a male figure she thinks or believes she is supposed to be submissive and follow. The fact that you de-virginized her is totally terrible, unless she willingly gave herself to you. If you ever break up, don't tell her you used her for sex.|`|14f5d1b00e3913722f81d4b3a53a087eaa	I hope she's at least 18......If it's not meant to be emotional relationship and she knows that then sure it's fine. But a girl willing to give you her virginity apparently wants more so yeah.  You be the judge if you don't love her don't lead her on just cause you get yours at every beckon call..it's wrong.|`|cjfKUdbPaa	Ya, you're taking advantage.  You're a pig.|`|6A0GkXXjaa	Yeah, you are taking advantage of her, it's probably okay for now, but if she starts to fall in love and want something serious, then it could turn into a problem and in that case if you still don't feel much for her, then just get away, you could hurt her worse than you imagine.|`|HOCypudCaa	Yes you are and you need to be honest with her and let her know how you feel because me honestly believe you shouldn't have sex with a person if you are not in love with them.|`|uNlbvD5vaa	If she knows you do not love her and is okay with that then no your not taking Advantage of her.  If that is the case, maybe she is willing to do what you want for her own experience as well. If she thinks you love her though and this is "special" you are definatley taking advantage of her.  Being that you are older step up and make it clear, if you don't you could hurt future relationships for her.|`|y9b8HGFgaa	first of all 12 years younger wow and second how old is and how old r u and third you r definitly taking advantage|`|9HkLq8Ogaa	Yes, yes you are. You took her virginity therefore she will be clinging to you, but since you dont love her eventually you will get tired of her and break up with her. She will be extremely devastated and you probably ...won't care.|`|AA11282101	yes, break it off now , if you really want to spare her feelings, and meet someone you truly love.|`|yqiPSR8paa	ur a ******* ***** if u dont really love her then u wouldnt want to be her first to break her virginity dang thats harsh see ur just one of them *** hole guys|`|WxWadsfxaa	you can't be serious....    YES|`|pszeAtFkaa	You already know the answer to that...it's just that the answer isn't what you want it to be.  You want someone to tell you that it is ok, so that you can keep doing it & not feel guilty.  Grow up & be a man!|`|hKVh1EIcaa	u r a manwhore|`|Ectn7tkSaa	Oh that is horrible!  Yeah you are taking advantage of her since you let her do everything you ask her to when you don't love her.  She is like a slave to you then.|`|WmUJE1LSaa	No, but I think your a pedophile|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Yes-she loves you-you idiot-she's not getting what she wants if you don't care about her. Do you think she stayed a virgin to give it up to a jerk? I only hope she's over 18 and you're not a molestor.|`|XTExSyv5aa	You sound charming! if you have to ask you already know the answer|`|BgzVBclBaa	well, if she does know that u dont love her , then shez gonna realize that shes not gettin what she wants .. YES, ur taking advantage of her !!|`|4a2VzINCaa	yes

But you will learn to manage it over time. Some memories are so strong that your subconscious also has a grasp of it.... which causes it to take quite a bit of time.|`|MjkDTovqaa	Because they are burned into our souls.

It's hard to be riveted by the original Friday the 13th when you're used to watching an orgy of naked women get disembowled in the first five seconds of a movie.|`|4x2KMVbBaa	It's not. I love the original. It's classic early 80s horror!|`|chPWEqWQaa	Because you are impatient.|`|YfIm4IqSaa	I would agree that you must be impatient. It is less violent and far less special effects than today's movies. It probably seems a bit cheesy also but that's part of what makes such movies fun! The movie industry today mostly thrives off of special effects rather than a good story. It's quite sad. Actors like Gregory Peck probably roll over in their graves whenever a lot of these new movies come out.|`|XCVFEAC8aa	I agree    I don't like the Original!    I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REMAKE!

I would rather fail and have everyone think I can work miracles.  I think.|`|FcovHfZcaa	i think one can lead to another but ......since  1 started all this then i think 1 is worst...lol|`|6ut6qMwraa	1st one|`|oOtdvgZ4aa	worse would be 1 because if people have low expectations of you then you can prove them wrong and raise the bar higher and higher|`|Argu0236aa	When people have expectations of me that they think are low but are actually high and when I dont meet theat expectation.|`|mMcrqP6caa	Both are equal I guess.|`|x5w3Bdbnaa	Um... personally i dont really pay attention to other peoples expectations (because at one point i could meet them all, but after i kept meeting them, people kept "raising the bar")... I think that may be a good thing though... to have your "goal" just outta reach so you can always have something to drive for... but yeah... i like having people depend on me, so id feel disrespected if someone had low expectations of me...|`|QK1yEipNaa	i think the second one is worse coz the first one is just PAIN|`|Dt06gcbIaa	It's better for them to have low expectations, and then watch their jaw drop when you meet and exceed both   1)  the low expectations   2)  AND the impossible ones, that everyone said were "un-meet-able and unrealistic!"

ab250551cde4aadbf54a0fea8a7b14e1aa	I remember that he liked to drink and got caught smoking pot more than once.  "On the set, he often played pranks on fellow actors and crew. His expulsion from 1955's Blood Alley is frequently attributed to his pranks, especially one in which he reportedly threw the film's transportation manager into San Francisco Bay. On September 1, 1948, after a string of successful films for RKO, he and actress Lila Leeds were arrested for possession of marijuana. The arrest was the result of a sting operation designed to capture other Hollywood partiers as well, but Mitchum and Leeds did not receive the tip-off. After serving a week at the county jail, Mitchum spent 43 days (February 16 to March 30) at a Castaic, California, prison farm, with Life magazine photographers right there snapping photos of him mopping up in his prison uniform.[3] The arrest became the inspiration for the exploitation film She Shoulda Said No! (1949), which starred Leeds. The arrest did little to affect Mitchum's career in the long term, but was seen as an embarrassment by his studio, who ordered Mitchum to clean up his act. The conviction was later overturned by the Los Angeles court and District Attorney's office on January 31, 1951."

B0avgIpRaa	Robot Jox (1990)  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102800/  Trailer: http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi3...  It is post-World War III. War is outlawed. In its place, are matches between large Robots called Robot Jox. These matches take place between two large superpowers over disputed territories. The main character Achilles is a pilot in one of the large Robots. The plot revolves around him and a match for the state of Alaska|`|m4PtEEDNaa	...well, if we're gonna do this, let's go the 'full nine', shall we??    ...actually, there were four, count 'em, four 'giant manned robot/machine' movies.  Along with the aforementioned "Robot Jox" and "Robot Wars", there was also 1996's "Robo Warriors" and 1990's "Crash & Burn"; although hailing from different studios, all four films were, on a whole, produced by the same creative forces & behind-the-scenes movie makers, all bore similar stories, and the man-powered robots, from film to film, were virtually the same, give or take minor and negligible re-design details....    ...it's not surprising that a question like yours, lately comes to rise much more frequently amongst queries, especially in light of the upcoming sequel to "Transformers"; the same thing happened, a couple of years ago, when the first film was announced, and eventually released.  There ARE definite inspired similarities, appearance-wise, between the mechanical juggernauts of both series of films, old and new.....|`|ZyGyDLsDaa	I've answered a question like this at least five times recently on Y!A Movies, so this movie and sometimes the sequel, too, must remain in the memory. I'm including the sequel, just in case you might like to check it out also.    Robot Jox (1990)  starring Gary Graham, Anne-Marie Johnson, Paul Koslo, Danny Kamekona, Jeffrey Combs, Jason Marsden  IMDb synopsis:  Fifty years after a nuclear war, the two superpowers handle territorial disputes in a different way. Each fields a giant robot to fight one-on-one battles in official matches, each piloted by a man inside, known as robot jockeys or jox. The contest for possession of Alaska will be fought by two of the best. The conscientious Achilles fights for the Americans. Opposing him is a Russian, Alexander, a ruthless and bloodthirsty adversary who has killed his previous nine American opponents. With a traitor feeding the Russians secret weapons information and new, genetically-engineered jox looking to take his place, Achilles faces obstacles at every turn in the hardest battle of his life.   You can see the opening of the film here:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y1N7MhFO7...    Robot Jox 2: Robot Wars (1993)  aka Robot Wars  IMDb synopsis:  In the year 2041, the rebel Centros are a plague to the survivors of the great toxic gas scare of 1993. A renegade Megarobot pilot (Don Michael Paul) and an archeologist (Barbara Crampton) must team up~despite personal differences, a reluctant romance, and official pressure to cease and desist~to thwart the Centro's attempts to resurrect a hidden Megarobot, with which they can challenge the prevailing order. // Also in the cast are Lisa Rinna, Danny Kamekona, Yuji Okumoto and Peter Haskell.  Here's the movie trailer:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=olJFpY4uF...

1UOIoOzKaa	No   No  No  But my friend did.  He went to see Avril Lavigne and the Jonas Brothers were the support act. Then him and his friends wondered off to find the Jonas Brothers after they were on. They got signed albums and posters and hanged with them back stage for about half an hour.  But this was a long time ago, like before they were as famous as they as they are now XD|`|JReroESmaa	hahaha no xD  that would be very creepy|`|jK1KqfKaaa	i will NEVER go to their concert!! i hate them! they're gays..|`|7bmPrNmhaa	not yet. but soon when i get to USA im gonna watch their concert.|`|AA12360257	I would like to go to a concert, but personally. i think all celebs are suck up to talk to
skslxcvPaa	Ugh, I hate the Jonas Brothers! They're f*cking fag*ots and retards!|`|E8go0osDaa	I hate Jonas Brothers so freaking much.  They're nothing but posers, and nobody realizes it!!!  WHAT IS WRONG WITH PEOPLES TASTE IN MUSIC NOWADAYS?!!?!?!?    With bands like Jonas Brothers, and people like stupid freaking hannah montana, people are forgetting what REAL music sounds like!    >.  I could go on for HOURS about how much Jonas Brothers, Hannah montana etc. suck, but there's no point >.    I think these people should be killed or something, that's how much I hate them!|`|48b7amuZaa	I couldn't hate them any more than I do!  I wish their 15 minutes was up...|`|2QFe7onpaa	I don't know who they are, but from the sounds of it I don't want to know. Sounds like another Hansen rip-off (if you're old enough to remember them). And that group is offensive because it insinuates that being gay is wrong. If you don't like someone, don't call them gay, call them stupid or something. Don't be ignorant.|`|pQBjqMkoaa	well im not in school anymore but they are GAY in my book    there music SUCKS TOO!|`|ukxt9YdIaa	i don't hate them    I dislike them, because everyone is just so obsessed.  i don't see what girls see, there not ugly but there not attractive.    also why didn't you put this on the survey page?|`|1gJ92tJaaa	nope dont like them at all!|`|aEbuB8Mwaa	yeah i hate them, but theres no group or club or w/e at our school about it.|`|kPalo5Kiaa	no i love them they are so boy band good guy cuties i |`|lU0vkHK2aa	Hate them|`|R57kufckaa	Yes I HATE the Jonas Brothers.

NKpEjgVTaa	If the Key signature is Ab, it has 4 flats. The order of  flats is B E A D G C F. So if you have 4 flats, the scale would go like this.     Ab, Bb, C, Db, Eb, F, G, Ab    Draw your circle. Start on C. To get the next note in the flats side, count 3 letters up not including C. So C + 3 notes more = F + 3 notes more= B.. now notice that the F scale has one flat. So when you put B, it should be Bb. Then from Bb + 3 more notes= whatever you get.     On the sharp side, you add 4 letters not including C.  C + 4= G  G+ 4= D  Then you go from there. If you need anymore help just e-mail me at manny.gnzlz@yahoo.com   I love to help people on these type of questions.|`|eeHrcxjEaa	Your question is kind of confusing but I'll answer it according to what I think you're saying.  If it's not what you asked for, just say so.    The order of flats and sharps is the same order as the circle of fifths, it just starts in a different place for each one.  -------------  Flats:  B E A D G C F   (I learned this as "BEAD, Garfield's Cat Food." Really doesn't make sense, but it's stuck for this long so I guess it did the job.)    Sharps:  F C G D A E B  (just backwards from the flats order)  ---------------  You're right.  Ab major has 4 flats, Bb, Eb, Ab, and Db.  (just like BEADGCF).  You're also correct that, in a piece in Ab major, these notes (Bb Eb Ab Db) will not be notated with a flat every time they occur.  That would be messy and would take a lot of time and ink.      To solve the time/ink/legibility problem, but still remind the performer that the song has 4 flats, the 4 flats are notated on the staff at the beginning of each line of the music.    Like so:  http://g.sheetmusicplus.com/Look-Inside/...  See how at the beginning of every staff, it has the 4 flats? On the B, E, A, and D lines/spaces? That's just there to remind you that those 4 notes are flatted throughout the piece whenever they occur.    So really, you don't just get a piece of music and someone says "Hey, this is in Ab major, I hope you remember which notes are flatted in that key! Mwahaha!" You can always look at the beginning of each line and be reminded.    However, it is much easier and faster if you don't have to keep looking back at the beginning of each line, so it's good to memorize which flats are in each key.  That way, every time you get to a note, you don't have to look back and check to see whether it's flatted or not.  You'll just know.    Hope that helped you! :)|`|VYWaL2graa	In short, yes, you need to know which noes are flat/sharp in which keys. Easiest way is to memorize your scales. Everything goes back to the basics.|`|AA12025213	Yes, that is what it means. It's really just memorization.    BUT the good news is that in your whole musical career, you probably will only FREQUENTLY use 4 or 5 of those key signatures, leaving you to figure out only a few when you come across them.    Believe me when I saw practice is the best way to memorize them. The more you use these scales and keys, the more you'll know what to do when you see them.    There are also plenty of online resources and tricks that have helped people before, so check that out! And remember to PRACTICE!|`|92d6e348e5e80228908a047d4e3c40a8aa	Sharps  F C G D A E B  Father Charles Goes Down and Ends Battle  Flats  B E A D G C F  Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles' Father|`|c3BGCFdFaa	This question has been well answered, but I'd like to add a little trick that you'll find helpful. When you see a key signature (a bunch of sharps or flats at the beginning of the line) it's quite easy to work out what key the music is in:  If you're looking at sharps, go up a semitone from the last sharp: that's your key.  If you're looking at flats, the second last flat is your key (except that if there's only one flat (Bb) you'll be in the key of F.    I must add that this only applies to major keys; the key signature could also apply to a minor key that's 3 semitones below the major key  (for example, two sharps (F  and C ) could be either D major or B minor.
