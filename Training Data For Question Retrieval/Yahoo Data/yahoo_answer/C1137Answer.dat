hLdIO43Xaa	So, before bedtime, take your hair and braid it into plaits (2 plaits) and then spray with sea salt spray!  It's a "salon secret" for beachy pretty waves.  In the morning, take your braids out and BAM beautiful waves!    You can make your own spray or purchase it!  See here for more info on how to get everything done:  http://www.beauty-and-the-bath.com/Sea-S...    I hope I helped! Good luck and have fun    p.s. Btw I hear that Sunsilk Waves of Envy Spray works really well, and so does Aussie's Catch a Wave.|`|xv3opX9Maa	blow dry it with a difuser and scrunch it with moose  ( =|`|Po8TFa4haa	i went to the beach:P    or when i go to bed, i wash it first let it air dry and i put my hair into a bun.|`|IPATFSAcaa	I already answered this on your other question.. 0_o I'll just copy and paste it..    Okay I have tried about a million ways to do beach waves and NOTHING worked. It just looked crimpy or fat. So I searched around online and this girl had the most amazing beach waves, so I asked her how she did it, she said she..  1. Took volumizing mousse and ran it through DAMP hair, it can't be soaking wet. Then scrunch it randomly, dont try to get it perfect..  2. Spray flexible hold hairspray (I use Aussie Mega Flexible Hold) directly into roots and massage it in, it adds a ton of volume. Then lift up sections of hair and spray them with hairspray  3. Put a few SMALL braids (about a cm wide) randomly through your hair. Dont do your whole head though or it will look too perfect..  4. Spritz with a sea salt spray (I use Sunsilk Waves of Envy Spray) and then some more hairspray     This is the ONLY thing that works for my hair.. Try it and see what you think! Oh yeah.. thanks for answering my question last night =D    Kelsey|`|CjW9fiSHaa	i take a shower at nite then i braid on tight thick braid. then i wake up and immediately undo it and do two tight braids. then i give it like 30 min. and spray it with hairspray and just scrunch it with my hand. it turns out amazing for me
K8rv2f2Iaa	GO TO THE HAIRSTYLIST IT WILL LOOK AWESOME!!|`|qAjcfjmeaa	If you are getting it professionally done than you don't even need to ask this question. They know how to dye your hair properly, that would be why they are professional. But you might want to keep up the maintenance by buying shampoo & conditioner made for color treated hair.|`|EwtCmQctaa	it doesnt turn ginger dont worry :D  it'll be fine :)|`|8ldMwflKaa	I think you should try it, because if it turns out bad, then you can probably get them to just fix it real quick for free unless they're total jerks lol... good luck!|`|tJGI4aLBaa	I had highlights done on Monday, they were awful, because I have layered hair it went all stripy and spotty.  I went back to complain and they did weave some out and put some more in, in an attempt to even it up.  It still wasn't right.  I went and bought Nice and Easy Dark Blonde (90) semi permanent and put that on.  Left it for half an hour and it has worked lovely.  The highlights have gone!  I know it will wash out eventually, but I am hoping I will like the result but if I don;t I will just use the same stuff again.
0emslEdiaa	I have four tattoos.  My first is on my spine right below my neck.  It didn't really hurt at all.  My second is on my right thigh, it hurt only on the outside part of the leg.  My third is wrapped around my calf right below my knee.  It hurt most around the shin and behind the knee.  My last one is on the top of my right food.  It was terribly painful     1 was about a 2   2 was about a 5    3 was about a 5   4 was about a 7|`|i46ta7ygaa	i have a tattoo on my hip and the pain was about a 5-6. not bad at all only a little bit on the hip bone.|`|0X7DWnyeaa	I have three. I would say the one that hurt the least was just above my ankle. The one that hurt the most was the shading done on my tattoo between my shoulder blades. Frankly I don't think any of them really hurt at all. I like pain a bit :0|`|d554b01f24aafacca61036628777e067aa	i have a shooting star on my lower stomach....hurt around a 4 or 5...i almost fell asleep so the pain was bearable|`|YWA8w7Ndaa	I've two tattoos so far. (Working on an idea for the third). The first one I got was a medium size star on the inside of my hip. I have boney hips so it hurt a little when it was on the bone but when it wasnt the only thing I felt was the vibration of the machine. I'd say the pain when it was on the bone was about a 2. I later had six little nautical stars added above it to trail up my side. They were a little more sensitive-probably a 3 at the most sensitive parts. The second tattoo I have is a tiger paw print for a local college on the inside of my ankle. It by far was the most painful. I'd say it was a 5 on the scale. I'm thinking about getting a script tattoo on my ribs now...although after reading some of the other answers and seeing the painscale...I dont know. I'll probably do it anyways though-thats just how bad I want it. :]|`|fMPuTA6Uaa	my least painful were the ones behind my ears ( i have a star behind the right and a moon behind the left) and i just had my first one touched up for the first time it's b/w my shoulders below my neck and it didn't hurt at all, it actually tickled a good bit (she kept going over this a nerve and it made my back jump kinda like when someone runs there finger up your spine)|`|oCfOuIr8aa	I got both of mine on my ankles. It was fine..not painful at all.|`|qv3tQ4biaa	I have 3 as of right now. 2 large ones on my rib cage and one on my lower hip bone. The hip bone was a piece of cake. If you are wanting to avoid a painful tattoo by all means do NOT put it on your ribs. Hurts so so bad!|`|qoKvIsBYaa	I have 15 and still working on more....I love INK!  The ones that hurt the least were the ones on my feet(right foot scorpio & left foot aquarius.  My sister's signs)!  The one that hurt the most was the one I got with my daughters name, birthday, and two lillies(that part hurt the most) in the middle of my collar bone and chest area... On a scale of 1-10 it was a 12...but I would do it again!  Oddly enough, I got all three of these done the same day!|`|YA0wKGORaa	im 14 and I got a tat without my mom knowing!! Oh well!!

The one that hurt the most was my ankle. The least.. my butt. I'm not even joking, it actually tickled. Probably a 2 on the pain scale, if that|`|vDky5V15aa	I am heavily tattooed and for me it all really depends on the size of the piece. They all hurt a little but the ones that hurt the least were the small ones. The large ones hurt more because the skin is continually irritated for longer periods of time.     If I had to choose a spot on the body that was the least sensitive, I would say the top of my foot, but again those are a collection of smaller tattoos.|`|LXROkDtHaa	i have four tattoos so far and the one that was least painful is the one inside my lip!=]|`|kCdISEGqaa	I have been tattooing for 14 years and have my own shop.  My arms are fully covered and my legs are in the process.  I have a large piece across my shoulders down the middle of my spine.  My ribs have large pieces as well.  I won't tattoo my neck, hands or face, some areas have to remain sacred I think.  They all hurt.  No one can honestly say, it doesn't hurt, they are lying trying to be tough and impress others.  I have seen the biggest, meanest looking men come in to my shop and pass out because it hurts so bad.  It is not unbearable, but it hurts.  For the outline, you have a single needle piercing three layers of skin at a very rapid rate, and being dragged along to form a design.  Then, when you add color, you have a combination of needles, sometimes up to 11 in the bundle, doing the same thing.  It hurts.  Don't listen to the tough guys and gals, they already have theirs, they've been through it, and if they get more, they know what to expect.|`|lcRbG4Csaa	Least painful was the stomach and ribs, although I did fall of the chair at one point when I was laughing, that was more to do with pride rather than falling backwards, still cant believe that happened..|`|F5MQtPEgaa	Here's my list in order of least to most painful... please not that any work for more than 4 hours sitting time hurts no matter where you put it... lol arm (although the inside by the pit sucks)  thighs  stomach  shoulders  upper spine  ankle  ribs   sides... love handles...  chest  knee  hands

Wearing makeup can do that sometimes and even mess up your self-image and confidence. Some volumizing mascara applied well can make your lashes look super long to the point that you don't need eyeliner. Really, mascara and gloss are all you need. I don't understand why you're not allowed to wear blush, though. Everyone blushes. It won't make any difference if you wear it or not, it won't make you look that much older. xD If your parents are that harsh about it, though, you may pinch your cheeks every once in awhile to color them.|`|iwOFiYwWaa	whyy not!??   and do you knwo lip gloss are better than lipstick you should stop wearing lipsitck and wear lip gloss and eye liner is like summing everyone wears i heard ppl that arent allowed other stuff but only allowed eye liner lozl  xx|`|ztrl649aaa	ya|`|dIeFRMdnaa	wow that is kind of crazy. im 15 and started wearing makeup at junior high age.    although, some parents are stricter then others and maybe there's a specific reason that your mom won't let you that she just hasn't talked about with you.    maybe you should find out if that is the case and tell her how you feel about it. i personally think you're old enough, and if you sit and talk with your mom maybe she'll try and be a little bit more understanding:)|`|0wcF5Sixaa	mom is BOSS gotta play by her rules u aint grown at 14 sweetie!!! u aint grown till u git that mind state of and god through adult things......till then i suggest u listen to mom cuz trust and believe there gonna b a time when u aint gonna b a kid anymore and u gonna wish you could go back so enjoy it while you can. and quit ur cryin i wont allowed to wear make up of any kind till i was 17/18|`|TAeWHERVaa	Personally i started waring eyeshadow in the 5th grade, but some parents are different. If you want to start waring makeup then start very light I suggest brown mascara and light brown eyeshadows. For eyeliner do not just ware BLACK! If you have blue eyes get brown or navy, if you have green eyes get purple or brown, and if you have blue eyes get navy or brown.|`|bEypuYJ0aa	I've been allowed makeup since I was 8.  Of course I think that's ridiculous. haha.  But also it just depends on your family beliefs as to what time you get to wear makeup.  If you're daring enough, ask for some old eyeliner from a friend or buy it yourself without a parent, stick it in your school bag, apply in the school bathroom, and wipe off before you go home.   I know plenty of people that do that, and it works for them.  Your parents never have to know you had makeup on!  :)|`|pwC0bEmHaa	hey u are in teen age now so u can put any make up on your face.

MQVmh5hiaa	the soap and water part will work but the steam won't because yeah it will open your pores but then it will more open for dirt to be in your pores and will actually make it worse!!|`|bab98853150b199df79ea228be16f757aa	I can help you clear your acne up, but it may take three months to clear completely, and you MUST follow every instruction, okay?  1.  Starting today, don't drink anything with ANY sugar in it, and keep your intake of caffeinated drinks to less than 12 oz a day.  Instead, drink LOTS of water ... at least 64 ounces of water a day (don't drink more than 64 ounces of water per day, though) ... this is to 'flush your system out quickly' and 'get rid of toxins in your body.'  2.  Eat TWICE as many fruits and vegetables every day than is 'recommended.  Include iceberg lettuce (mostly water) and make sure that every meal (even breakfast) you eat 3 full cups of 'salad' ... lettuce, tomato, cucumber, mushroom (raw only), onion, and use only balsamic vinegar to 'dress' it (NO OIL AT ALL!).  Eat lots of veggies and no more than 1/4 pound of meat at lunch, and no more than 1/3 pound of meat for dinner.  Have a good 'high carb breakfast' but make sure it's 'complex carbohydrates' ... 9-12 grain toast with ONLY a tiny bit of 'unsweetened' jam, all bran with fruit (use only 1/2 the recommended 'cup' of milk, and use only 'non-fat milk'), plus fruit.   3.  Wash your face AT LEAST three times a day, as follows:  use NO soap, face wash, or other 'chemical' on your face.  Wash with water as 'hot' as you can stand, thoroughly scrubbing with a 'roughish' wash cloth and put the cloth into a 'dry it' pile.  Using a new clean cloth, rinse your face in four successively cooler waters, scrubbing thoroughly, and put that rag into a dry it pile.  Yes, you'll have to do the laundry ... your mom will love you for it!  If you do this for at least two weeks, you should see a very noticeable improvement in your acne by the end of two weeks.  ONLY if you see a noticeable improvement may you start 'adding' to what you eat ... use ONLY 'olive oil' for the first two weeks, as little as possible, for a full month.  Don't eat any candy, sugary sweets, or any oil or fat other than the olive oil.  DO NOT put your face over boiling water.  EVER!!!  You can do serious damage to your skin and may end up in the 'burn ward' with scars.  DO NOT use ANY SOAP or 'face cleaner' either.  Don't wear make-up at all (if you are a girl, or a boy who likes to use makeup occasionally) and don't use any 'cover up' to hide your acne.  Your face needs to 'breathe freely' and be totally clean of chemicals.    4.  Do a 'garlic flush' on your body (weekend days are best for this, due to the 'body odor' you'll get at first) once a week.  Eat a 'full bulb' of garlic in a day (you may 'roast' it, and it's really very tasty) and the garlic will help you get 'flushed out.'  A 'bulb' is a WHOLE garlic not a 'clove' which can be broken off a 'bulb' ... you'll need to eat a whole garlic at least once a week, and eat a 'clove' of garlic in addition every day.  Eating onions (RAW is best, or roasted) also helps flush your body.  Not only will you start to feel better all over your body, but your acne should go away over time.  You'll get a few 'minor' breakouts as you are flushing your body, but they won't last as long nor be as large as the zits are now ...   HANG IN THERE!  Once your body is 'completely free' of any 'toxins' your whole skin should be clearer, and you should get far fewer 'zits' over time.  Eat well but 'healthy' and do a good exercise routine daily, remember to eat a clove of garlic every day, bathe at least once a day (you may use soap on your body, but NEVER on your face again, ever) and soon you'll find that you need things like 'antiperspirant' only when it's really hot and you're exercising.  Eat lots of fish (watch to see that it's 'fresh' fish and not a kind that is full of mercury and other metals ... and try to stay away from 'farmed fish'), a little meat, good complex carbohydrates, and salad.  If you need to lose weight, you may stick with the 'three cups of salad at every meal' (it fills you up so you don't take in as many 'heavy' calories) but if not, then simply cut back to one or two salads (with olive oil mixed with balsamic vinegar to dress the salad) a day as long as you are eating the 'recommended veggies and fruit' every day.  Eat foods that have lots of antioxidants, don't drink ANY juice without watering it down by half (those calories in juice can cause you to 'over-eat' quickly).  Yes, you may want a sweet now and again.  Eat only DARK chocolate, and never more than an ounce per day (early afternoon, for extra energy is best) ... and GO TO SCHOOL!  You'll have a wonderful, healthy body that is actually more 'ready to learn' than ever ... and you'll need to get a good job to 'stay on your goals' in both clearing your acne and getting your adult life going strong.|`|WRbbpRZzaa	Go to a dermatologist.|`|KgTTX2Nyaa	my sister tried that and it worked but her acne wasnt that bad  and try drinking massive amounts of waterr, see if that helps  cause i drink Alot of water and my skins clearr|`|Rf2r23sYaa	That probably won't work. If there is any way you can see a dermatologist then do that. For some people over the counter products don't work.|`|Z9360MMxaa	Well from my experiences with bad skin the only thing that has ever worked was Accutane. I never had it severely but still persistent and annoying. Your doctors are going to try and tell you to take tetracyclines first but tell them that you are worried about scarring and that you won't take anything less than Accutane. Try a low course first like 20/mg a day for 4 months and see if that works. After you are done Accutane I can guarantee all you will ever need to use is water. Just know ahead of time things get worse before they get better. Check out this site it has more information than anywhere else on the web. www.acne.org|`|mpUsNchQaa	NO do not put your face over boiling water it could eally heart your skin it will burn it and could make you blind do not use soap it never works and just go to school who cares what you look like you will really regret it when you are trying to get into a collage  if you miss to many days of schools TRUST ME! live your life and dont let pimples ruin it and to get rid of them just keep trying or go to your doctor and they may give you percription it will work a lot better than one over the counter or skinID|`|L7EAUdeWaa	hmm|`|Pwqx6yZvaa	if it gets that bad you need to see a dermotologist. he will be your best help.    i am on a pill for my acne and its amazing!!!|`|b5xJqC5oaa	try wal*marty, they have good face cover up products|`|TfLPRwFWaa	You use all sorts of products may be the reason why..    Stick to one and use it for 2 weeks you have to give the product some time to work it all out.    Stay away from Oily Products look for oil free products on makeup or face cleansers.    Take 8 glasses of water everyday and stay away from oily foods.    Don't scrub/exfoliate everyday its too harsh on your skin.,    Do not pop a pimple    You could try taking acutane but remeber it can cause liver damage and depression|`|hh403SkVaa	i use clean & clear. and i dab (dont rub) face dry.|`|PNLwOIOraa	dont even go to school some days cuz i have stupid zits on my face that i dont want ppl to see        Try when you get in the shower (bring a cup of ice) put the water as hot as you can stand and let your face soak in the hot water for like 6 seconds then rub an ice cube around your whole face till its cold. then go back in the water and do that same thing about 5 or 6 times. When you get out rub some alcohol on your face with a cotton ball.

It works for me.|`|SmpPuIRzaa	You could use soap and water, but regular bar soap really dries out your skin, which is good to get rid of the zits, but not good for the overall health of your face. (Or perhaps Dove wouldn't dry your skin out so much?)    Have you tried Proactive? Proactive works for many people, with only a small percentage of people who are unaffected by it. It also has a Mask Creme to put on difficult pimples. I use it, and it's pretty great.    The Neutrogena Wave also has great results, I've heard.    There is also Clearasil, which has an Acne Remover creme that I use when I have difficult pimples.    Also, a facial/peel should help.    I really hope this helps?|`|wogjc0Adaa	Generally a good cleanser that gets all the muck and grease out of your skin should do the trick, the soap and water idea sounds good but remember that some soaps can either make your skin particularly dry or even greasier.    If you're really concerned about your skin, see a dermatologist or talk to your doctor about acne treatment - it can sometimes be more than just needing to cleanse|`|KWfVUaknaa	if your skin is really that bad get your parents to get you on accutane. it clears up your skin forever in 6th months|`|BrHAp7oqaa	I had a similar problem when I was 18.  I tried Proactiv, stuff from Wal-Mart...EVERYTHING.  Mine were the really hard, under the skin zits, and they would not go away!!    I actually started using that stuff from Neutrogena...skin ID?  I don't know if you have heard of it.  You take a little quiz online about your skin type, the acne you have, and your stress level.  It basically creates the perfect acne treatment for your skin type.  After like a week, mine was cleared up.  I occasionally had breakouts after I started using it, but it seems like it balanced out my skin and it really helped me a lot.    Some basic things you can do to help it are to drink plenty of water, exercise, and eat good foods like fruits and vegetables.  You know, the basics.  Don't pick your skin, and if it is really dry, using a daily moisturizer like Clean and Clear oil free moisturizer.  Stay out of tanning beds, the sun, and other harmful things when you have bad flare-ups.      Oh...and some nighttime remedies that worked for me are toothpaste...just dab a little on the zit at night and wash it off in the morning...it helps the swelling go down.  Or, you can dab a little peroxide on it to dry it out and take a couple of asprin before bed.  For some reason, that works too!!    Good luck!|`|jXiigjCbaa	Number one... GO TO SCHOOL regardless of those stupid zits. :)    Secondly...normal soap will really dry out your skin which can cause your pores to become even more clogged...You have to make sure you get acne treatment...have you tried pro active? I used it when I was younger, worked for me...but you have to keeeeeeeeeeeep using the product or they'll just come back...ive now been relying on a very expensive exfoliant I get from this spa but it's in arabic :S    If you honestly feel you've done and tried everything you can, go to your doctor and ask for a referral to a dermatologist. They have access to much more intense medications than you can get at your local pharmacy.|`|1PAQuX72aa	Hi there.Most of you have probably seen television commercial featuring celebrity spokespeople such as Vanessa Williams, Kelly Clark son, Elle McPherson and Jessica Simpson touting a product called Proactive. Proactive acne medication is an easy three-step system that will help you achieve clearer, healthier skin in a relative short period of time. Proactive is the highest selling topical acne system in all of America. The product was developed 8 years ago by two dermatologists and is available without a prescription.I have used it now for many years,with great success!!    Step One    The first step of this revolutionary acne skin care system involves a renewing cleanser. This product contains an oil-free formula and tiny grains that gently remove dead skin cells and bacteria that become trapped in the pores of your skin. A common ingredient called benzene peroxide is also used to destroy the bacteria and heal any blemishes as quickly as possible. This exfoliate will gently remove the impurities from your skin.Just gently rub onto your face with a little water.    Step Two    The second part of the dermatologist-tested skin care system involves a revitalizing toner. This product does not contain any alcohol which tends to dry out your skin. Instead it contains natural botanical ingredients that help to remove dead skin cells, unclog your pores and remove excess oil. This will not only soothe your sensitive skin, but will also leaving it looking and feeling refreshed.    Step Three    The third and final step of this acne skin care system incorporates a repairing lotion. This lotion does not contain any oil. As in the renewing cleanser, this product contains benzene peroxide which will help to clear your blackheads and prevent further acne breakouts. This product is soothing and safe to use all over your face.    Proactive contains prescription-grade ingredients such as benzene peroxide with soothing botanical ingredients such as aloe, chamomile and panthenol. These ingredients are combined into 3 different products that work well together to heal your existing acne and prevent further cases. The system is very simple to follow and consists of applying the renewing cleanser to damp skin and massaging gently, then applying the revitalizing toner with a cotton pad, followed by applying a very small amount of repairing lotion to your skin. You may want to give this system a try  you wont have a lot to lose, except your acne!|`|LYKG72craa	The answer may lie in your gene pool. dont forget about that!  Usualy wen people have this kinda issue, its brought on by internal factors such as eating habits, stress management, and heredrity.   To conquer the three, I have learned the following:    EATING: Dont eat foods that you KNOW has a lot of grease and sugar. Choclate has been long believed to cause zits, but it actually doesnt. However,CONSTANT cosumption of fatty, salty, acidic, and greasy food DECREASES the body's chemical balance, and it cant release the "toxins" fast enought before they get into your bloodstream and surface to your face. DRINK LOTS OF WATER, everyday (yes, vitamin water counts, but not Gatorade, sugar sugar...)  STRESS: Well, this is gonna have to get cus hosrt, stress is different to everyone. All in all, just try your best to talk out/discuss things that may be bothering you. Most people unknowingly damage their bodies from "holding onto" stress. Relax when your tense and tired, DONT try to "keep up" with every trend and scene. In todays world, people are having heart attcks @ age 37! Less stress = a better body, including the appearence of the skin  GENES: Ask your parents, or just look at them, too see "where" you get it from. For me, it took time to realize that I was creating the pimple, and its wasnt my mom/dad. I had an addiction to soda and citrus fruit- not anymore! For this one, just do a lil family tree study...    All in all, too much washing is BAD, and to little is BAD. Wash/cleanse no more than twice a day, and once @ night. Neutrogena, Dove, and Nivea would be my recommendation. Good lucc!    FIERCE_09

Yes, it's a moustache -- some girls develop a moustache, just like boys do.    Most guys are OK about girls with, for example, a slight moustache.    If you do decide you have to do something, then there isn't a simple answer and there's a lot of misleading "information" around.    Facial (and also body) hair on women comes about in the same way as on men because of    1) your body being sensitized, before you were even born, to testosterone -- doesn't happen to all girls, but does to many    2) your body producing high levels of testosterone    The growth rate and coarseness of the hair depends on just how much testosterone is circulating in your bloodstream.    Steer clear of bleaching -- when someone sees you against the light you'll look as if you have a glowing moustache. Believe me, it shows up far, far worse.    As far as removing it is concerned it's worth remembering that    * Waxing, plucking, threading, epilating all pull the hair out by the roots and where the growth is hormonally-driven can actually stimulate a dormant follicle into producing more hair quicker. They also distort the root if done repeatedly, leading to hair growing at strange angles. And you've got to let the hair grow to quite a length before you can repeat the exercise. It can also damage the skin and discolor it. Long-term use of waxing also causes bad wrinkles.    * Chemical depilatories strong enough to remove the hair are very likely to burn the skin, cause swelling and cause long-term discoloration of the skin.    * Laser is also liable to cause burning and discoloration and in any case only works effectively on a dark hair/light skin combinantion.    * Electrolysis is very liable to cause scarring and discoloration of the skin.    Which, like it or not, leaves shaving which does not damage the skin and does not cause the hair to grow more or coarser or faster. Best done with a men's-style electric razor, the best of which, for girls and women, are probably those from the men's range of Philips/Norelco razors (Philishave outside the US). Most girls and women who try a men's Philips/Norelco wonder why nobody ever told them about it before.|`|xbcf7aFjaa	Ummmm.... why in the world don't you just wax or shave it?!|`|Diucgiriaa	um...why dont u just shave it or wax iit?|`|NkhblCaSaa	No way you should grow it out!

AA10093245	You should probably try a 6 week rinse, like Clairol Beautiful browns first. It will still "grab" because bleached hair is very porous. but you would be able to remove it much easier than a permanent color. You would not be able to remove a permanent dye and go back to blonde, it would destroy your hair.  Having a darker color will not make it shinier by itself, because the hair is damaged from the bleach, the surface of the hair is rough now, and it's a slick smooth surface that shines. You can use a clear cellophane or colorless henna over the bleached hair you have now for some smoothing effect, and  more shine.|`|u7o75zipaa	It's not that simple to get dark hair light again.  I would recommend going for a light - medium brown first. You can put it over your current dye, but it may be worth getting it down at a salon.|`|1WRB7RPNaa	dont get any color that has ash in it, the ash will turn your hair greenish|`|4dbkzIuXaa	no|`|AA11490319	I would suggest first trying a golden blonde semipermanent. That would help you see how you'd look a little darker. Also, as long as you keep to a semipermanent then yes, you can go back. Keep in mind that the lighter your hair colour the brighter and more intense your colour results will be. Also, no matter what kind of hair dye you use, your hair will always be lightly tinted that colour.     As for what to look for in a colour, go to a proper coulourist for tips. The best colour will come from looking at your undertones, overtones, and all over colouring, which should be left to a professional.     --Veronika|`|jNHPcyvqaa	DO IT DO IT DO IT    I have darkish brown hair, about 3 weeks ago i was proper bleach blonde. I had used bleach and colours on my hair before and myh hair went straight to brown, so there shouldn't be any problems getting your hair brown.  Since i've done it nearly everyone has said i look better with brown hair - i was worried it would make me look realllly pale but people have said it makes me look less washed out and looks in better condition cos it looks shinier! So i DEFINATLEY think you should do it !    As for going back blonde....it is do-able, but will probably damage your hair quite a bit and it would have to be very gradual (highlights first, then slowly lightening your hair) if you just bung blonde onto dark hair it'll go orange - i've also done that before and it wasn't pretty lol.    Also my natural hair color sounds the same as yours and mine turned out good ! The only bad thing about dying your hair from blonde to dark brown is that it fades quick - my hairs already faded to like a medium brown so i'm gonna have to dye it again, and you'll probably have to keep dying it to keep the right colour.    good luck ! xx|`|wAjuh2YZaa	ya|`|SetyQexoaa	I suggest you go to a salon for a consultation, that way they they can visually see your hair and determine what is right for skin color and to help prevent any unnecessary damage.|`|bxCJNImPaa	i like brown and blonde highlights or the other way round. u could the it like that|`|PliIXKdIaa	i suggest you don't dye your hair dark and just get extra low lights through it instead.   i'm not pale skinned but when i dyed my hair darker from my really light blonde i looked like a ghost all the time and it didn't matter how much make-up i put on to try and look browner!   (plus blonde's have more fun!!) hope my little experience helped!

8a76a86b81f35749361f4b01e4f950beaa	1. It is seldom you find clothes that are worn out. We only take them if they have no stains, tears, or holes, and we also don't take them if they are worn out. Sometimes people bring stuff in that is brand new that they couldn't take back to the store!    2. Remember it varies from condition of item and brand name, but typically:  T shirts: $3-$9  Jeans:$10-25  Dresses: $6-14  Sweatshirts:$8-16  Long sleeves:$4-10  shorts: $4-12    3. The bag is usually the size of a typical walmart bag..maybe a little smaller. The number of bags you can fill is unlimited!! So yes, you could get two bags for 20 dollars. But where I work the deal is $15 dollars per bag, that could be because of the location though.     Also tip for the grab bag sale: roll up things as tightly as possibly to get the most in one bag. I have seen people get 100 dollars worth of stuff in one bag!!!|`|3m4YrL8qaa	love that store!!!!!!!!!  they're pretty much brand new  they're pretty damn cheap haha it just depends|`|cRuqfZdsaa	i've gone to plato's closet a couple of times. my sister got hollister jeans for like $10. shirts are usually like $7. and they aren't worn out at all. it's amazing. i don't know why more people don't shop there! hope that helped! :)|`|q1vIo0Lbaa	Now i have never shopped there.... but my sister works there and wear there clothes.. they have hollister and aero and everything else.. they have really cute clothes.. and theree products are not worn out.. there bags are pretty good to.. they are very cute..

RJ20ezDOaa	oatmeal facial mask -   http://www.beautytipsonline.com/oatmeal-...    circles under you eye -  caused by :  broken capillaries as well as long term allergies side effect which gives under eye a brownish tint.    treatment:  There is a new roll on caffeine stick from Garnier.  Home remedies don't seem to work.        cover up :    1) do not apply any concealer over the area, it draws more attention rather than cover.  2)  Use loose powder and a white eye liner inside your bottom lash line. this has the effect of making your eyes pop and and taking attention away from under your eye  3) Use only good quality liner pencils and mascara.  As the day goes by the less expensive products tend to "shed" or "breakdown".  When this happens the area below your eye is where it settles leaving the area even darker.      application:    1) Before applying any eye makeup dab on loose face powder  a) lightly over eye lid and then dust under your eye.  (one shade lighter than face and think clown face amount)    2)apply all eye make up.  Once full eye is completed and dry use a fan brush to whisk away excess powder.    3) This kind of application will give you perfect eyes all day without dark circles.     Hair:  Wash hair in warm water.  Use a gentle clean shampoo and apply conditioner only from ear to ear and down.  (Your scalp has natural oils to condition that top of ears area.) When ready to rinse out condition apply cold water.  The coldest you can stand it to rinse your hair.  This will make each individual hair shaft smooth and your hair will be super shiny.

Use a decent amount of shampoo and really massage it in and rinse well, then use a little bit of conditioner but only apply it to the ends, nowhere near the scalp!|`|TfLPRwFWaa	Get baby powder and put it/rub it into your scalp it absorbs the oil in your hair and should keep it fresh for a few days(: I tried and it works(: hope I helped    ps if you wash your hair too much in the future its a chance of you losing  hair|`|vGHExDOzaa	I would wash your hair everyday when you wake up because you sweat at night also try using a different shampoo|`|b1256d852b56b556e6bb26806d1c64eaaa	Perhaps you brush or comb it too much - that doesn't help - also, if you over-wash it, that doesn't help either, as your hair is losing the natural oils that keep it the way it is. Ask a hairdresser or stylist for advice.|`|vwu6PU4eaa	wash your hair everyday!|`|5gANvXyTaa	my hair does the same thing. i am just trying to take more showers    good question=]|`|GITMn6eDaa	There is some stuff you could buy in a drug store that make your hair look un-greasy that you should try. Just go and ask and there will be something that works. Also try if you can to wash it everyday and stop playing with it! Its makes you look nervous and unconfident anyway!|`|nKXTjqQWaa	Wash your hair every day. Use conditioner only on the bottom half of your hair, not by your scalp.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	I wash my hair every day, i have to because it looks greasy and i work out and sweat alot.  Every one is different and has different hair, i know some people who only wash their hair 2x a week..yuck! jmo.    Do you use product?  that could be making it look greasy.  Use a good shampoo and conditioner, sold in a salon, it makes a huge difference.  You should only use the conditioner on the ends and if it doesnt tangle when you wash it dont use it every time you wash it.|`|TtOCh3JSaa	The more you wash it, the quicker it will become greasy again. Your scalp produces natural oils and if your hair is thinner than your friends it will show up quicker. Dry shampoo which you can buy in most chemists will help you through that second day before you wash it again or maybe try shampoos for fine/greasy hair.
nObgLVkraa	Look in the mirror. Get one of those curvy measuring tapes that can wrap around anything (the kind sewers use) & start from your armpit and slink it around your curves & bust. It will resemble a shape. And there you go! Or you can always go to your nearest custom  designer and ask them!
vnOz03Aaaa	oh your so pretty! :). hm, try this procedure.    1. apply foundation such as covergirl tru blend.    2. apply a thin coat of blush.    3. use neutrogena concealer to patch up any blemishes.    4. add golden sparkle eyeshadow to your eye. don't go far past your crease. be sure to add more below your crease and less above your crase.    5. carefully press a liner pencil along the bottom lashes.     6. add mascara (2 coats on top lashes and 1 thin on bottom)    7. finally add a nude light pink shade of lip gloss.    i have really fair skin too. for me, the really light ivory color of covergirl tru blend works great. mineral makeup also looks good. and orange happens to me too!! trust me, i've done a BUNCH of experimenting with makeup because my skin is so fair it's hard to find some that matches my skintone. good luck and have a great night!! :)|`|wXrAqf8Caa	eye liner, definitly some, um... like that wats it called, purpleie, um, its a food, not like grape, um EGGPLANT! that nice dark color would look nice on you! O and also try to really lite shimmer under the brow, and also do like a lvender for eye shadow, i hope it wont look orange!                      PS dont forget to apply the eyeshadow with a big brush and do it lightly|`|LREo3Tjpaa	maybe some eyeliner, it doesn't have to be black now a days they have every color under the rainbow that may help to brighten your eyes, I think you should go with some neutral colors, browns, darker blues, purples, maybe a tad bit of blush a light colored one and stick with the lipgloss.|`|Y2k81CWWaa	EYELINER. I think a brown eyeliner would look best on you. good luck|`|NhTgABm9aa	you have great eyes. go for some golden bronzes and if you want some color go for a plum with a black liner
IDtUBv1eaa	i would go to the doctor just to make sure you're not anaemic (iron deficiency) as i know dark circles are often a symptom of this. (if so don't worry, it's easily fixable with iron supplements)|`|2ZtKyUoLaa	Olay Definity eye illuminator    its a serum made for wrinkles and dark circles  im going to buy it soon myself for my birthday  i have had REALLY dark circles for my whole life and i want them gone    there is no guarantee that they will go away, its all part of trial and error of finding whats right for your skin|`|YCVCZE0Iaa	Put a couple spoons in the freezer until they're very cold. The once they're cold enough, hold them to the circles for a while. Take advantage of all of the angles of the spoon and move it around a little.     Some people say to use frozen used tea bags, but truth is that the caffeine will stain your skin.     You could also use cucumber slices or potato slices on your eyes.  To start seeing results do it for a while. And keep it up! I do it and it works like a charm for me :)  hope this helps!
az0Z0DIjaa	Lol. I was 16 when I started wearing makeup,too. I like Almay's automatic eyelier. I don't know what color eyes you have, but the amethyst one looks nice with hazel eyes. For pencil liners, I just like NYC's eyeliners. It's cheap,comes in a variety of colors and you can get it at Wal-Mart.       Also, are you running the pencil liner under warm tap water for a couple seconds before trying to put it on? If not that migh be why you're having to tug on it so much.  http://www.almay.com/  http://www.newyorkcolor.com/|`|QwXIsKAhaa	MAC definately try the Fluidline, best eyeliner everrrrr|`|Y2k81CWWaa	The store Hot Topic sells eyeliner for only two dollars (eye pencil kind) that workd really well and doesnt smear very much. www.hottopic.com has all the details|`|kW371HVMaa	MAC has great eyeliner! www.maccosmetics.com  try it out!|`|kJ0tNA4Vaa	YOU SHOULD TRY A EYE PRIMER.

vnOz03Aaaa	THE BOUFF:    1. Add heat styling product to protect your hair.    2. Create some gentle waves with a curling iron.    3. If the curls are too neat/tight mess them up a bit with your hands.    4. Section off your hair on the top part of your head and pull it back, securing with clips/bobby pins.    5. Spritz with hairspray to hold the style.|`|fe0a49feef439eb10337016cd285e511aa	the second link confused em    but from the first picture    use a triple barreled curling iron|`|QajuWPzxaa	scrunching with a little twists and tucks with a medium curling iron|`|kK5JIJ6raa	try to straighten it and then crul it|`|2ytMFBS4aa	try getting all of your hair wet, then scrunching it up with some gel.|`|xc1d2yOiaa	if you get this special spray i think its bed head, just when u get out of the showwer dry your hair then wet it with bed head and push up on your hair like scrunching it  kinda like this pic  http://www.lynnechapman.com/images/scrun...|`|RC2aQBkgaa	Well I have naturally straighish wavish hair, and to get my hair like that I use a small amount of mouse and take about half my hair on one side and start scrunching it. Then i scrunch it and pull it into a messy bun. Then I use aussie hairspray and scrunch spray in it. I do that and put my hair in 3 buns and sleep in it. It worked very well saturday night, but sometimes i do get frizzy curls. Other ways include a curling iron, but if you use it everyday you could dry out your hair and get split ends. A heat protector spray may help, but may not. Or if you have some time on your hands in the morning take a shower and when you get out towel dry your hair slightly and then brush it thoroughly. Next, get some mousse, any type will do, and start at the bottom of your hair and scrunch it. Hold the scrunched hair to your head for a little bit, and continue this. It will give you around the same result asthe bun idea. If neither of those work, Another thing you could do is put it in curlers and in the morning brush it out with your fingers a bit to get the tangles out and make the curls smaller.|`|GITMn6eDaa	I cant really tell what girl you are talking about but if its the one i think you mean, then after you take a shower and your hair is still wet either put it in two tight buns or a tight braid and sleep with it in. Take it out in the morning|`|nKXTjqQWaa	I have no idea which girl you are talking about.
9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	If you spent half the time learning about proper stretching that you spent posting these silly questions you would know that it's a really bad idea to skip sizes.    http://www.articlefit.com/Guide-to-Stret...|`|W1vdfn1yaa	if you want your ears to rip then go ahead, skip sizes|`|zRZKdH1Zaa	Well yeah, it's going to hurt a lot.  And it's not just the pain, you will also be ripping your ear.    Silly kids....    19, eh?  You're acting like you're 10
IOGPax5naa	My friends had ears of steel too.  It probably means that where it was pierced, you had very little nerve endings there (unlike me, where the pain was awful).    As for sea salt ... maybe.  It might have helped kill bacteria if there was an infection, but I wouldn't reccommend it.  I used the solution given to me.    And YES, turn daily, even hourly!  Don't yank at the earrings, turn them!  You don't want to know how painful it is, twisting a piece of metal that became attatched to your flesh!|`|aXKqXZhgaa	i got my cartilage about 2 months ago and i go it with a gun at the icing. mine didnt hurt AT ALL either. when they did it, i was still waiting for them to do it after they did it. haha. i didnt feel a thinng. and all my friends said it was gunna killllll. so dont even worry. its perfectly fine. and im not too sure about sea salt solution.. but yeah dont worry its finne. (:|`|K7Eg3BIRaa	I got mine done in a store 3 times... the 1st 2 times i got a small bump around the piercing so i took it out. I though it was from using fake earrings so this time I got REAL ones this time! The second time it didn't hurt as bad as the 1st and the last one just got really hot but not 2 irritated. I think its the way its pierced and and hair products you may use. I have a friend who has 21 piercing in her ears she all done herself and she's fine...|`|O24FewSQaa	i got mine done proffessionally with a gun.    and this is a really stupid question - thats awesome for you that it doesnt hurt! it is bad if it does hurt a lot......?|`|iJR6qAV9aa	Well its suppose to hurt a ton!  I would never get that pierced..  uhm anyways - your just lucky i guess.;P  Or you have a low pain tollerence.  whatever it is...just be happy.|`|e68a6a673385cf8ff6673cecb42f930aaa	Why would you use a sea salt solution, to make yourself hurt?  I'm guessing you just have a high tolerance for pain.      Is the piercing acting up at all? If no then don't think about it.  Don't provoke it to hurt.|`|aHnjBlh6aa	listen.i got mine done with a gun BIG MISTAKE. it messed the top of my ear up & now it's shaped differently so I took it out.And you are supposed to turn it every day it gets the hole in there.It may be sensitivie in the beginning to do so but it will help & don't forget it clean it!!!!! I got mines done at claires & I used there ear cleaning solution stuff in the bottle.It don't really help use salt solution.
mp5Vg7Peaa	If you haven't done any sort of course on make up you should do one to get your status officially on paper.    Then make yourself up some business cards and hand them out to places with up comming events like a local youth club/ communtiy hall, any where that puts on shows ect and when it comes to prom time hand out cards then aswell.    You should also do some voulenteer work and leave your details so that they know your reputable and will think of you for the next time.    This is what I got told to do from my last boss as i want to be a theatrical hair and make up artist. One down, one to go :)|`|wXrAqf8Caa	well, how old are you? if your still in like, high school, then for a dance, you should invite some best buds over and do it for them, ask them to spread hte word(if they like it!) and if ur in college, the do it for like a friday night out, out of college, then have a night out with friends, and have a soa day!! you can do make up, others do hair, another do like nails and so on...

Po4Lljjwaa	I'm shocked at the number of girls who say they also sometimes wear 2 bras.  Crazy.  I guess it makes sense... but to be honest I thought there'd be a lot more "that's really weird" comments.     Now I wanna wear 2 bras.  *LOL*|`|4KOuL7mZaa	well to tell you the truth when you where 2 bras it will prevent your boobs from growing. and plus less straps to handle.|`|f86luyi7aa	no i do that every day like a padded one then a sports bra over it?  yeah.  all the girls in my grade do that   some wear three to make em bigger but yeah  thats not wierd|`|SNCeFeY1aa	not really. when i go to the gym i wear  a normal bra with a sports bra over top. im not sure if it really changes much but you know whatever|`|Ohn0oRSfaa	umm yea. u r just tryin to make you boobies look bigger|`|wImGU52iaa	thats actually a really good iddea...  omg thanks hahaha|`|YdCF6q8taa	I've known a few girls who have worn 2 bras at once, but the best thing to do is get a nude colored padded bra - less shoulder straps and more comfortable|`|AA10048205	no its okay  but doesnt it feel weird.  how about you wear a cami under your shirt so it doesnt feel weird.|`|Anh2pwceaa	yes only wear one other wise people will think you stuff
F5MQtPEgaa	i find on the spine is was very tolerable... but as it goes out to the sides it really hurts.   i think its such a common place to be tattooed (like you say... tramp stamp....) that there's a lot more ditzy girls out there to tell people how much is hurt compared to the playboy bunny they have on their shoulder... realistically there's WAAAY worse places to be tattooed. so no it's not THAT terrible, but yes, it does hurt quite a bit more than some other places (and probably about the same as your hip... at least thats what i found) take some candy with you... if it gets intolerable just start shoving the candy in your mouth... it'll raise your endorphens|`|os43UNvqaa	Well i don't know if this changes your mind but if you get a tattoo on your lower back, you can't get an epidural when you are having a baby...|`|qoKvIsBYaa	I have two near my "c-section" area One on each side(I had a c-section a year after the tattoos were done!) and I have one on my upper-lower back, middle back, upper-middle back, and between shoulder blades...So as far as it goes with the pain no it really doesn't hurt...You have a high tolerance for pain you are gonna be aight!|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	No not that bad....|`|8tdlP1rOaa	i got one on my lower back  i think it depends on your pain tolerance  a friend of mine said it was worse than childbirth (...she tends to exgagerate...)   i found the pain rather slightly enjoyable...  but you have to be in that one particular category.....  but what im trying to say is, it all depends on how you handle pain|`|3cCunajcaa	you can have an epidural! i hate when people put this up here. yes you will have a tattoo there but its not going to bother that one bit. if its on a bone it will probably hurt but you should be able to handle it.
cDpu1Dxyaa	If you think you are too fat fr them, then don't wear them.  Opt for a straight leg slim Jean instead, they are more flattering on the thighs and legs.

Really, a picture would be best, but sometimes you can't honestly follow a trend if it will make you look bigger than you are and feel self-conscious..|`|boqwvEvUaa	it really depends on your body shape. honestly, skinny jeans are meant for ruler-shaped people. not saying that you have to be skinny, your overall body should be less curvy, because skinny jeans subtly emphasize those curves. however, if you're like an hourglass or pear, then they're less flattering on you.  it may just be low self-esteem--find a friend who can be honest to you, but not harsh, and ask how you look in your skinny jeans ;)|`|mpUsNchQaa	do not worry about what you look like looks arent every thing if skinny jeans do not work for you try something else who knows maybe you can start a new trend and maybe there is something that you can pull off and not many other poeple can who knows someone had to invent that style and maybe you look better than you think from your veiw thing look a lot diffrent|`|WGzJUSefaa	Check out this site for free fashion!

Also look for foods that are high in iron    Foods such as Eggs, beans, cottage cheese, fish, yogurt are all good choices to help promote healthy hair growth, whole grain cereals, leafy green veggies are good too!|`|tlDoq2a6aa	When choosing food for hair growth, remember that hair is made of protein; therefore protein-rich foods should make up a high percentage of your diet. The second most important hair nutrient is iron. Each key nutrient below lists the foods that promote hair growth:    Protein: liver, brewer's yeast, fish, eggs, beans, cottage cheese, yogurt, tofu.    Iron: liver, whole grain cereals, dark green leafy vegetables, eggs, dates, raisins.    B Vitamins: eggs, meat, poultry.    Essential Fatty Acids: walnuts, canola oil, fish, soy.    Vitamin E: avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil.    Sulfur: meats, fish, nuts, legumes, vegetables (especially onions).      As you plan ways to incorporate food for hair growth, also be aware that there are some culprits in our diets that are actually detrimental to our hair!    Caffeine  Sugar  Fat  Carbonated drinks|`|GQbF0Twiaa	Well i know strawberry's do their in shampoo!|`|P9inKWOaaa	vitamins from greens like broccoli. protien from nuts is good.|`|plBEI90paa	hair food|`|fUbq0arraa	carrots can help make hair grow|`|5gANvXyTaa	haha hahaha nice question.|`|VbaH2Vnaaa	no food makes hair grow ive been searching for the same answer my self than i asked a doctor and he said that it doesnt matter what you eat|`|xc1d2yOiaa	i dont know about food, but Milk products like cheese, yogurt, even ice cream|`|8WEFPUDUaa	there are no food but there are vitamins u can take: vitamin B and E  my hair styliest told me!!!|`|R2bqI7luaa	Peanut butter somtimes|`|2yVbbs1faa	http://www.hairboutique.com/tips/tip214....

FDBJs1lOaa	Neosporin is terrible for a body piercing such as a belly ring because although it removes the bad germs, it also kills the good cells that are trying to heal the area around your piercing, therefore dragging the healing process along and putting you at greater risk of infection. H2Ocean is probably the best solution to use so I strongly suggest you use that and just try your hardest to keep it from bumping anything. If it gets too bad to where you can't touch it then I would go talk to your piercer or a doctor.  I hope that helped :)|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	It's bad for piercings. It says right on the box that it's not for use on puncture wounds.     Try some proper sea salt soaks rather than wasting your money on h2Ocean. It's really not the best thing to use. Mix 1/4 tsp sea salt with 8 oz warm water and soak for 10 minutes 2-3 times per day.

HE1cJJQYaa	if you get the proper jewelry, go to a reputable piercer, and take care of it well, it will heal well, leading to less or no scar tissue it shouldn't be too noticeable. also, how long you leave it in for determines that as well. and the longer it's out, the less noticeable it becomes.|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	Nope! Just be prepared to have hard nipples. Ha. They will go back down if you ever decide to take them out. It's not going to disfigure your nipples at all. You might have a tiny bit of scar tissue... but it's not noticable. Also, use titanium when getting them pierced (which is usually provided) to make sure you don't get infected. If you just keep it clean and don't mess with it you shouldn't have a problem. =)|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	It may make your nipple appear slightly larger, but as long as it's done properly and taken care of properly it won't disfigure anything.    Poor jewelry size/type can cause scar tissue. Be sure to have barbells until it's healed. Rings move too much and can cause scar tissue to form    Only use sea salt soaks to clean it. Soaps and harsh chemicals can cause scar tissue.    You will have a mark, just like you would from any other piercing if you decide to take it out. If you have the piercing for a year or more, the hole will not close up, but it will shrink. Piercing permanently alters your body and it is something you should consider before any piercing|`|46eedfcc0d431f5086b7b4cfa950eb57aa	Duh !|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Wellll, you ARE putting a hole in it...That is pretty darn disfiguring.|`|xtYywJzVaa	it will make your nipple hard more often|`|yCjJJIStaa	I had my nipples pierced 14 years ago and took the piercings out a couple of years later.  I can still feel some scar tissue running through the nipple and see where the holes are, but they're small and nobody else would really notice.|`|dmVNmaugaa	All depends on you and the size of them just make sure you use someone that knows what they are doing if you feel you need to do this. In some ways they are very sexy and sometimes they are not. I do know some people that have them say they are more sensitive because it does keep them erect. You asked I answered. Good luck with your decision. I would rather see them there than in the lips and face, big turn off for me.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	It can if it gets infected, You choose whether it's worth the risk or not.    Personally, Nipple piercings are nasty, But look trashy on women.|`|P9dEdEDQaa	Another possibility other than having the normal scar tissue and/or "hole scar" is the possible rejection of the piercing. If the piercing jewelry is rejected by your skin you will have a forked nipple for a while and the scar tissue would build up in the middle of the fork, from then on without proper scar repair/removal you would have that scar for the rest of your life.  Your nipple would be erect most of the time also if you decide to keep the piercing(s) since it causes more sensitivity to your nipples. (Which could be a very good thing to add to foreplay!)
U6rCN4R8aa	i always paint my nails white.  actually i paint them white for spring and half of summer, then silver for half of summer and for fall, and then for winter i paint them navy.    but anyways, white is perfectly fine and i love it! it makes your skin look tanner too|`|Po4Lljjwaa	I think you should do it if you want to!  All these darn shows like, "What Not To Wear" and "Fashion Police" have everyone scared to think for themselves.  If you think it'll look cute, try it out.

Be a leader!!!  ; )|`|JwW7j8yYaa	Yes, I will paint my nails any color|`|KNFjx8KRaa	I think white nails are gorgous! if they are painted evenly, i love painting my nails white on occasions like weddings ect, your hand looks more delicate and pure:)|`|0iklUZHJaa	then you should definetly get french tips not full white but if you decide to have white put sparkle on top or just do a spakly silver|`|MksOlZaVaa	Definitely hot, unless you use whiteout.

It's not original if your doing it because your friends are doing it. All around sounds like deep down you don't want to do it and I think possibly it would be for the wrong reasons. You will know what you want when you want it and you will not need to be talked into it. And by the way, what happens when you catch a cold and have to blow your nose,and if the pierce gets infected for whatever reason, you will look funny with a big red infected face. JUST MY OPINION!
9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	The idea is that the vitamin E will help your skin heal, rubbing it into your skin will promote blood flow to the area, also helping it heal.     So no, you don't have to use it forever, just until the scars fade enough for your liking (they won't entirely disappear, but will become less noticeable with time)

2SKGFRzuaa	It depends on how well you take care of your hair.     Regular washing and conditioning is a must. Do not over brush your hair, or let it dry out. Try to stay away from things can dry out your hair, like hair dryers or straighteners. Split ends can also cause it to grow slower.     If you keep it extremely healthy, it would grow mush faster than 1/2 inch per month.|`|p4668Wx2aa	try taking biotin vitamins. or a bcomplex my hair was soo short last year and know its probably as long as yours definitley grew longer than a half inch per month but i religiously took my vitamins and it grew so fast! everyone i talk to now takes them and has the same affect. just know it makes your nails grow really fast so if your one for always gettin them done it might be a lot more frequent! its also good for your skin! look it up. its vitamin biotin.|`|MtXZJ2eWaa	Probobly 12-18 months.|`|6DszSDt4aa	Hair grows an average of 6 inches per year, or 1/2 an inch per month. It really depends on the girl though, some girls can grow an inch in a month!   So for the average hair length it may take up to a year to get your hair that long.|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	It should take about a year depending on how quickly your hair grows. Be gentle when brushing/combing your hair so it won't break off as it will slow the growing process and eat lots of avocado's and gelatin, they will aide in the growth process. Take a multivitamin as well.|`|bppjhIo1aa	I want to grow my hair long too. I had it cut to my neck and hated it. Mine is about the same length and I had it cut in early September 08. So I think it should take about a year or so to grow it long. I've found that it helps if you trim about 1cm off the bottom about every month or two. It makes it grow quite a bit quicker.  Hope this helped|`|wmVBNzyoaa	The answer to "instant hair growth" is that there isn't any.   I am sorry to report that there is just no known magic hair bullet. If you want to go from a short chop to long flowing locks instantly you have limited options.  Your best bet for overnight long hair is to consider hair extensions, long wigs, clip-on braids  if you can wait it would be best to cut it an inch or 2 then it will grow even longer than before|`|VScUgPMJaa	um about a good 2-3 years if you want it that long.  and please do not cut an inch every 6 weeks cos  you will end up the same length before.

Qz3sii2caa	My secret; the Intuition razor. Keeps the bits smooth and (so far) no nicks. It's kinda creepy because it's so smooth a shave you don't feel it doing anything but it works really well. My husband likes it so much he started jackin' my razor to give himself the once over. He's always scared of nicking his balls but the razor works so well he doesn't trust any other but the Intuition! It's great too because it doesn't give me razor burn (must be that huge hunk of moisturizer on the blades).     I only wax my eyebrows, lip and chin. The rest I shave.

Be careful when shaving there not to shave down towards the legs because you don't want it to become thick and dark around bikini line, but if it's already that way then do that as well. I was told by a friend that using natural oils right after shaving helps with the pumps. And once again mayonnaise is the perfect moisturizer . Wash it off of course you don't want the dogs attention more then what you already have lol. You want it perfectly smooth down there so I would recommend the brazilian wax . It does hurt some but it is so worth it. I only do that once or twice a year . I use Dove face moisturizer which also has a tanning toner inside it. It helps with the blemishes and gives your face a soft feel.|`|n0TBUVnFaa	:) These answers will help me too.|`|K7Eg3BIRaa	I get a brazilian wax 'down there'! I love the outcome n so does my bf. its painful but its worth it in the end. i think it cuts down on razor bumps n its a bit cleaner especially when our lil 'friend' comes once a month. i can go get it done once a month. once u get it done its grows back a lil lighter and not as fast and as much as shaving. it cost more but of course u get what u pay 4. I spent anywhere from $55-$45 which i think is worth it again|`|PXnqbABlaa	well..   first of all, dont spray tan, it looks awful.  if your going to do that than i would go the the tanning beds.  but..of coarse natural is the best.  just go outside in a bikni on a sunny, hot day and lay out on a towel or something for awhile.  i usually do about an hour  but u can do it longer, depending on the heat    for making your bikini line smooth, shave a few days before you are planning on wearing a bikini, u mite have to do it another time too. this lets razor bumps settle down. u can use lotion as well, if u wanna.    for my hairstyle, i use multiple things. my hair is really long, blonde, and strait. so mostly, the only thing i use is a straitener, and hairspray.    but if theres a specifiic way you want to do your hair then just tell me.    for cleaning my face i use a clean and clear blackhead cleanser, and i use a noxema thing too after that.   and now my skin has not one pimple, so if thats a problem of yours, it mite help.  but ive never had bad acne..so i wouldnt know what is perfect for that.    anyways, if u want to know how to do a hairstyle, i can definately help u|`|fe0a49feef439eb10337016cd285e511aa	wow thats alot to answer!    i only tan for big events (ex. homecoming prom big night out)  dont spray tan...gross    aveeno is the only good self tanning lotion  doesnt smell    i shave only when needed  longer hair equals better shave and cuts down skin irritation    get eyebrows waxed only when needed    have bikini line shving gel and cream to prevent adn treat razor bumps    the bikini line nair is ok. wax is a betch down there.    wiat till hair down there is kinda long. 1cm? shave slow with lots of gel all directions     good razor.|`|K1Uvl2kXaa	omg i really need help getting groomed too. i have never tried and im only 13. so people please answer, sorry i didnt answer and im totally with you on this question.|`|rbUvk2A8aa	Hmm...

That will make the razor bumps, and the hair will grow faster.  If you can find a good wax use it, or have someone do it for you. Waxing is good because it removes dead skin as well. If you cant do that because of the mess, use an epilator. It hurts like hell at first, but you will get used to it, and you will only have to do it about every 3 weeks, no disgusting bumps either.The very best thing to do is get laser hair removal (if you can afford it).    Whatever you do ladies, don't ever let your man see you with hairy legs, or a forest growing, if you know what I'm talkin' about. I never saw a man in all my life who liked that. If I'm wrong just let me know.

Hard to say what a healthy weight would be because it also depends on your bone structure, not everyone whos tall has a broad shoulders or is 'big boned' as they say. But going by BMI charts (body mass index) anything from 135 ish to 170 is 'average' for someone 5 foot 11. Keeping in mind that your bordering underweight on one end of the scale and over on the other.

AA11311675	Yes it does. Some brands put an expiration date on their bottle. The effectiveness of it gets reduced over time and usually only a year, although some can last up to 3 years if stored properly. Things to consider are where you store the lotion, because heat can make it go bad earlier. I have also noticed the scent of many of the tanning lotions go bad and no longer smell pleasant, so you would most likely want to replace it if the product doesn't smell as good as it should.

9mRhdTbBaa	The pain will probably be about a 6. But if you're using tapers, that should make it easier. Put the tapers in as much as you can without hurting yourself, and push them in a little bit more after you take a hot shower; that's when your lobes are the stretchiest. I'd do it over the course of a couple days.|`|3xoEFFOKaa	it should?!|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	What to do when you tear your lobe/get a blowout:    Downsize your jewelry, make sure that you have implant grade stainless steel or titanium jewelry in. Nor organics or acrylics. Sea salt soaks daily until healed. Vitamin E oil rubs to help with the scar tissue. Wait at least 12 weeks before attempting another stretch.

5i7yRvUcaa	Good glue on nails? Well, I use the $5.00 Broadway Nails that you get at Longs or CVS Pharmacy. They work really well and stay on for at least a couple of weeks. I use them because then I don't chew my nails, and they work pretty well.       Plus, you can pick any nail design you want. And, when you're done, all you have to do is trim the artificial nail, file the surface down to break the topcoat, and then soak them in acetone based nail polished remover until they're soft, and then wipe off the softened glue and plastic.     As for the brush-on-gel nails, I've never used those. Sorry.|`|Lrr1gSFcaa	Yes, they work. Just put on the tips and brush on the gel, like the instructions say. It looks just the same to me.

iqUGDn6kaa	Bio Oil.  My girlfriend had an operation on her elbow and bio oil just brought the colour back.|`|9e0b3eb053495521ed772cef2058be0faa	Try theatrical make up. It's thicker than the regular stuff and will cover better. I would just wear clothing that covers them most of the time, but I know you can't really do that at the dermatologist.     Please do talk to someone about why you're cutting yourself. I won't tell you it's bad, but I do want to encourage you to find someone you can trust to talk to.|`|Q2HmWDURaa	if concealer doesnt help you maybe its because your skin doesnt react good with liquid make-up....go to your local drugstore and but a cheap powder foundation of your skin color and see if it helps...i have a 3-D birthmark(not kidding)on my left cheek and i cannot entirely cover it but the powder works better than the liquid on concealing...hope i helped you!!plssss vote as best|`|o298GAKcaa	try bio oil i had a few stretch marks on my hips but i can barley see them give it chance to work though you will see the difference.|`|MOhFynFTaa	Liquid Vitamin E helps scars go away.

b2ata3gUaa	Since the area is muscular it should be pretty painless. My first tattoo is on my lower stomach and the only part that hurt was when the artist was tattooing on my hip bone, which was only for a few minutes.|`|qoKvIsBYaa	The two that I got hurt about a 3 on a scale of 1-10...I really depends on your pain tolerance level...Mine is high!|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	I'm sure it's not that bad. I think all tattoo's are tolerable. Just don't work yourself up about it thinking it will hurt.|`|d554b01f24aafacca61036628777e067aa	nope not really. i almost fell asleep under the needle
ctJc4jotaa	its their job i go there and i tell them what i want to buy and they just let me try it out but of course you have to buy some of the products they use in the makeover|`|FklngtvCaa	Yep.  When they ask you if you need anything  or if you're looking for something, just ask  them to suggest stuff or give you a makeover.    It's part of their job, they would be happy  to do it... all you have to do is ask.    Don't think you're just gonna do all that free  though, just buy a couple things they use in  the makeover like lip gloss, blush, or mascara.|`|hfG5Ag7jaa	you have to ask. be like can you show me a product that is good for....and ask them to apply i for you so you know for future reference|`|NhTgABm9aa	sure. thats their job. and the best part is its free. they are usualy reall good about it|`|qFvHH6lUaa	Sephora is great.  It's free, they're good and they're really nice.|`|NmV5XWlJaa	You sure can! That's what they're there for.|`|Ki4jcO2Saa	It's their job to be of service to you, so if you have any questions just go up and ask any available employee. They are usually very knowledgeable about the products. If you have any questions about how to use a specific product, they will probably be more than willing to show you how to as they have samples of just about everything, but I would recommend that you ask them to sanitize the products prior to applying them, as you never know who has been sticking their fingers in them. However, while it is their job to show you how to use the products, I think you have to pay for a full make over. Also, if you approach an employee and they are rude to you or even ignore you, feel free to find someone else to help you and even report that employee if you feel the need. They are there to provide a service, so there is no need for you to put up with any rudeness if you should encounter it, as I have a couple of times at a makeup counter. And don't let them talk you into buying a ton of products either. I've had five or six different products recommended to me when only asking about one. Anyway, hope this helps!

AA10752232	head and shoulders, i love that shampoo!|`|KppM3VzAaa	Hmm, this is a hard one, losing hair can be caused by all types of things.  Some Shampoos can help, depends on the condition of your hair.    A lot of time it is due to a lack of something in the body, protein, nutrients etc.  Also it can be caused by stres and lifestyle.  How is your daily diet and lifestyle?    There are many products out there to help along with the correct shampoo and conditioners, the correct diet and correct lifestyle.    Have a look at a web site I found www.bring-my-hair-back.com  which may be of good help to you.    Good Luck, I hope it is a simple answer, I truely believe supplementing your diet to ensure you are fixing the problem from inside out is the key.  Every part of your body stems from the inner cells
VDmh1N3Aaa	Hair loss comes mostly from within. So make sure you ear eating healthy. Take a mulitple vitamin approved by your Doctor.     Avacado's and Gelatin are great in aiding helping make your hair healthier and fuller. Your nails will grow too. Stay away from fried greasy foods. Eat loads of vegetables, fruits, low fat milk products such as yogurt and milk/or soy milk.     What we put in must come out!     Make sure you are scrubbing and stimulating your scalp when you shampoo. Take your time and really get the nerves and blood moving while massaging. Just like we need to massage our gums when brushing our teeth, it's the same principle.     You need to use 2 different kinds of shampoo. Both need to have a healthy PH balance and you will not find it anywhere except for a salon. Pay a little more for healthier hair. Ask them what they suggest but make sure they are not just trying to make a sale. Research the product online first.     Switch products regularly each week from a cleansing shampoo to volumizing shampoo. Only condition the bottom ends of hair not near the scalp. This will help with the oilyness.     Good Luck.|`|7dVtO1gtaa	i am not quite sure. i know that rogane foam is supposed to stop hair loss.

hfG5Ag7jaa	they dont buy the clothes at certain places. people bring them into the store and sell them to the stroe just klike you can bring gold to a jewler and get money. or like a pawn shop. also, just like antique collectors, when someone who dies has unclaimed clothes, they can take them
PXnqbABlaa	listen, what your friend said to you is wrong.  i have side bangs..and no pimples.  just make sure that when your in the shower, use blackhead cleanser, and get it on your forehead.  also, i dont know how much you do,  but, shower everydday.  trust me, it will be FINE!  your friend is probly just jelous that your hair is going to look like hers and is probly going to look cuter.   =)  def. get side bangs, they're really cute|`|HXACf352aa	when you goto bed pin them up.|`|GGgAfh1Eaa	Just keep your hair clean so it doesn't get greasy. You shouldn't get pimples then. =)|`|KVzBqWhvaa	Whhaat, I've never seen that happening.. unless she doesn't wash her hair. It's not gonna form pimples under your bangs unless you sweat a lot/ have normally greasy face / don't wash your hair / normally have pimples to begin with.|`|PPaBFIpGaa	I don't think having side bangs will give you pimples under them. I've had sidebangs for years and never had that problem. Plus, like you said, if pimples DO show up, you have your side bangs to help you out.
xoJ9NML2aa	Well, i read in an article that if you buy sea salt spray and spray your hair while it's still wet, and scrunch it up with your hands... you'll get that "beachy-wave" look.  you could also just put sea salt in a spray bottle filled with water and use that.  hope i helped.  (:|`|mweM8qoKaa	Scrunch it(:  Or blow-dry it, that usually settles hair a bit.  hope this helped[:|`|O7xYvttsaa	use conditoner, like hydra TLC or something, and then put mousse in it, and let it dry naturally. it's really easy to get shiny hair.|`|NhTgABm9aa	scrunch it and use garnier surf spray for that beach look|`|EY0wnkh3aa	Take a shower and while it's wet do french braids. Or just braid it all in separate braids all over your head. Then when your hair dries, take out the braids and you get beautiful waves!
igrdohopaa	Yup.

ZhVgTYPZaa	I would try black jeans instead of leggings. The top is cute though :)  try:  http://store.delias.com/item.do?itemID=5...  since the shirt goes down to your knees, leggins would look odd with it.

aV0QmAOtaa	I live in a really cold city during winter time so I  wear them for the purpose that they are warm.  But yes, they are ugly! Haha. Unless you can  deal with the weather, go for something more  stylish :)|`|p4668Wx2aa	i love love love my uggs! and i dont think that they are ugg-ly.. they are totally worth it! and they're very stylish not to mention their style never changes so u can always wear them next year and the year after. but if u live in a very snowy place like me. they get kinda of ruined. and salt from the ground stains them and the rain makes them feel rough so u have to buy the ugg spray!!|`|jMGyLvNsaa	I love Uggs, they're really comfortable!! :)|`|4euWhDlCaa	I love my uggs, I think they are worth it!  They are really warm and cozy,even without socks. My feet don't stink when I wear then without socks, but I usually do wear socks with them.  I would get the chestnut color. They match more with colors and stuff then the others. Good Luck deciding. ^-^|`|5urfAbazaa	uh.. depends.

Not that difficult.  They're expensive aye, but if you look after them they last for a couple of years, whereas fakes need replacing every couple of months.|`|EQPE72hpaa	In my eyes, they weren't really pretty to start with.UNFASHIONABLE & TRASHY.  Buy some nicer boots from Forever21 or Charlotte Russe.  I got these:  http://www.forever21.com/product.asp?cat...  and they are unbelievable cozy.

Just talk to the girl, if she says no, so what? you got nothing to lose. Be  proud|`|n0TBUVnFaa	No, NEVER!

I know plenty of guys at my school that have never had a girlfriend, and definitely not just the freshmen.  Do what you can to up you looks.  be funny, and sweet.  Even though your really shy, you just have to force yourself to talk to the girl you like, and if she's not interested, its no big deal!  obviously it wasn't meant to be, and you'll find another girl that is crazy about you, and loves your artisticness =]  And I would MUCH rather date and artistic guy than a jock.  Good Luckk.|`|WTz9VMrYaa	NO! not at all! There's tons of people who never had a real date . I am 16 and I never had a date but that's because I'm hella shy.

They are not, however, interested in shy guys.  Sorry.  Girls are naturally more drawn to confident males.  Thats why you see some of the most duche-baggy guys, or "losers" with girlfriends and think to yourself, how the heck did HE get THAT girl, and I can't even get a date?  He got her because he swallowed his fear of being shot down and went over to talk to her in the first place.  I'm absolutely positive that some girl has had a crush on you in the past, and I'm sure that someone probably does right now.  But you'll never know until you start talking and putting yourself out there, because unfortunately, girls in general wait for guys to approach them.  Good luck.  Take it one step and a time and things will work out for you.|`|AGaT3BDMaa	I am a freshman in highschool and a girl and we really actualy someitmes do care about stuff like artisticy and such. We are not all stuck up and shallow. You will get  girlfriend personale I like the more shy guy but I like him to be open and himself around me when its liek just us. Guys who are loud and want to always be the center of attention really annoy me. Even if a girl is really outgoing she isn't going to ask you out tho probably so you need to learn to make the first move. You never know the most popular girl could like you but be to shy to ask you. I am really out going but when it comes to the one guy I liek at the time I usually have a hard time just being me or telling him how I feel cuz I think I am going to get my feelings hurt. But all other guys I see as my friends I am totally cool with. It is differnt for every person tho. Hope I helped, hang in there. plenty of freshman havn't had dates we aren't that old. And trust me I highly dought our entire dating life can be determined on how it has played out untile up till now. If that was the case then most of us are screwed. Even those of us who have had a billion boyfriends already. Cuz mostly guys would suck to me :)    XOXO hope I helped :)|`|GHci7XBXaa	Hon, you sound too cute ^^    I adore artistic and shy guys. I know I'm not the only one, by any means, and maybe you just need to step out of your comfort zone a little bit and show people what you're about. Yeah, it's kinda tough at first but it makes the social life more fun, for sure.    Things pick up during high school, trust me. You'll find someone.    Good luck doll :]|`|pwrful9oaa	I like artistic, shy guys...|`|W840msNTaa	most likely not unless you change things    You need to become more outgoing and start talking to girls, otherwise  you will get no where.
VDmh1N3Aaa	I wouldn't. Your hair is so pretty.     But if you insist on cutting it. I would go with shoulder length. Color it a medium/dark brown with beige highlights and part it in the middle layered towards your face and make it straight.     That would look awesome!|`|3YpVVRWpaa	Dont cut it short you have a face of an angel. havent seen a angel in short hair cut  get it layered with some bangs in the front for a change  you look cute|`|By1DJAUOaa	yeah to a little below yur shoulder|`|PFtmxY3qaa	shave it off and donate to locks of love....or mayb a bob lol|`|qzCa9W1Caa	cut it a little bit cut it up around ur shoulders and do cute little layers on it      hope i helped  10 points!|`|ufpAijadaa	Taking your face shape into account, I would keep it long enough to barley touch your shoulders, mabey a short bob, like Victoria Beckham    You have beautiful hair! Personally, I wouldn't cut it at all!|`|8siJtEssaa	Yes. If you want a new look cutting it a little longer than shoulder length with layers and maybe some bangs off to the side would be good. It would be cute straightened.|`|vC6DXRWgaa	i dont think you should cut your hair, it look pretty|`|c00c6f49f36132d1f3da0e5f8e4d6288aa	you shouldnt cut much off your length, in my opinion.  i believe you should put layers in your hair and try different styles,  if you want a change. if you want a dramatic change you should try middle length hair, i dont think short hair is very good on many people.  most people i know look better with longer hair:)    hope you like the decision you decide to choose either way.    good luck*|`|SwVW0yrAaa	Your hair is fine like it is. I guess maybe side bangs?|`|Zvc3rSKsaa	i think it looks nice how it is but if you want to cut it than layering would be nice.  :)
cYktV9B5aa	Maybe Blonde with black streaks or just blonde....or a really dark brown..>|`|YJeA0Rgsaa	You like nice how you are but if you really want to dye your hair the best idea would be blonde.|`|Eqi0BNUhaa	no link attached.|`|zPFclJznaa	dark brown w/ caramel highlights|`|Ym9bRgcDaa	You are GORGEOUS!!! :D NO KIDDING!    I think you would look beautiful with chocolate brown hair!  Try Loreal Preference- it makes your hair shiny, healthy, and YUMMY SMELLING!!! :DD    Good luck!|`|nQ800xxTaa	go for it! what color do you want ? I think you will look good with whatever color you choose|`|7FjB8FfXaa	idk|`|fY85aNlxaa	Dye*    I love your hair colour, but if you want to dye it..  i say you should dye it dirty blonde.|`|v0aMGO4Oaa	I really like the color you have! Chocolate brown would look good though.|`|AAZTO16baa	dye it pink and blue|`|ITZRv0XGaa	My friend got Reddish brownish hair with Blond highlights and it looks GREAT on her and im pretty sure it will look good on u|`|zi6Ipmfuaa	i think you should do a darker brown. you have brown eyes and you hair is nice right now but more darker you might like.|`|SRs6xcxPaa	blond|`|b9MbC3Uraa	Maybe a lighter red or a light brown. You have very fair skin just like yours truly and if you go too dark or too light it'll make you look even whiter. Trust me I went dark brown and it looked awful.

If you have ugg boots or anything simlair to them those would be really cute with a pair of leggins and a dress. with a half jacket  or even a full length overcoat.

Ok, let's get started.    Hairstyles:  Dark, Long Hair: If you have dark hair, you have no excuse for it to be cut short. If it's long, brush it until it's silky, and make a side cut. If you're really sporty, create a side cut and then a pony tail with a scrunchy.    Dark, Short hair: You shouldn't have short hair.. But we'll fix that. Make a cut down the middle, and, if you're not afraid of critics, get it pushed back with a hairband (works best if you have assorted freckles). Otherwise, make a cut down the middle, and get a really cute clip and put it in to distract from the fact people can see your shoulders.    Dark, Medium hair: The night before, take a shower. Take your brush and put gobs of conditioner in it. While in the shower, brush your hair until you feel absolutely no nots. Wash out the conditioner. Steamy water (though it might burn your scalp) works best for this. braid your hair in really tiny braids, and clip it back in a ponytail before you go to bed. In the morning, take them out and brush like crazy. Your hair is now wavy. Make a cut down the middle, pushing half the hair behind your ear. To keep it there, use a butterfly or dragonfly clip.     Long, Light hair: Ponytail, ponytail, PONYTAIL! Dye a lock, about an inch or two in diameter, a darker shade of your own hair color. Push all your hair back in a ponytail, and keep it there with a scrunchie that matches your outfit. The only hair that should be left out, is that one strand. If you like to wair it down, ask your stylist to make your hair wave out at the end. Keep your hair over your ears (light haired people tend to have red ears) or, if this is uncomfortable, push one ride back. A center cut usually works best.    Short, light hair: Ok, I'm sorry but I absolutely      short, light hair. If you have to have it, make sure, at the least, it doesn't curl inwards at the end. Short light hair is bland and annoying. I actually reccomend dying it a nice auburn or natural brown until it grows out. But let's add some pizzazz. This may sound really prissy and Bratz-girl like, but it's not. Take a hair brush, and put gobs of conditioner on it. Turn on the shower, and make sur eit's really hot. Brush and brush, even after all the knots are out, until literally every strand is flat. this might take more than an hour. Don't wash it out yet. Duck your head down so your head is looking at the bottom of the tub, and take a comb, and brush that too. This'll brush the front and back of your hair. Wash it out with steaming, almost burning if not burning, water. Your hair should be very glossy now. You might find this really silly, but get a bottle of hairspray. Open it, and put in silver sparkles. They should be about 1/16 of the bottle's total amount of contents. Shake it and spray your hair. Hairspray with a nice peach scent works perfectly. No one will be able to see the sparkles, only that your hair shining. This is really, really, good. So there you go.    Light, Medium hair: Wear it flat down, as plan as you can manage.. NOT! If you're feeling up to it, have someone make two braids for you on either side of your head, RIGHT next to your face. make sure they're the same size. Tie them. While holding these braids, have your friend brush your hair until it's so flat, you can almost see the tip of your ears through it. Then have them pull the braids back, and tie them together like a pony tail, or a tiara. This is really risky, but also fashionable if you can pull it off.    Now, on to clothing.    Long, dark hair in a ponytail: A sport's hoodie works great. Wearing a graphic tee underneath works great. Don't actually put the hood on though, and always keep your hands in the pockets of the hoodie. Wearing light, worn out jeans, frayed at the ends, is really awesome with the hoodie. Sneakers, Vans, or tennis shoes will finish this ensemble.    Long dark hair hanging down: A blouse, red especially, and dark blue skinny jeans with black heels that point at the toes are fashionable, and reccomended. This is actually a look being sported by      s, and has been sported by      s for over 5 years now.    Short medium hair: get a black t-shirt, and something see-through green, red, blue, or even white, but only white if it has a rose design on it. Put on the black t-shirt (cannot be loose, must be tight!) and the see-through shirt over it (the see-through shirt must be loose, but without sleeves!). Wear any kind of jeans, preferably dark jeans, with this. Heels or pumps work great with this.    Long, Light hair in a ponytail: Same thing as dark hair in a ponytail, except zip off the hoodie half-way through the day to reveal a sport's shirt. The pants should also be sport's shorts.    Long, Light hair hanging down: Beautiful blouse and skirt. Simple as that. If you're uncomfortable in skirts, find the shortest miniskirt you can, and make it frayed at the bottom (short like barely covering your underwear). Put on jeans, an
7wHhjMCYaa	i love the outfit in the second question. the top is hot and great for a date. the shoes are very rad and make your legs like nice and long. buutt..i'm not sure about the skirt. it's really cute, but i think for a date you might look better in a dark skinny jean. but that's the only thing i'd change. and put some big flirty curls in your hair. i think you're gonna look great! oh, and you've got a good body girl. no rolls!..be happy! lol :)|`|WGzJUSefaa	Check out this site for free fashion!

jxRooBhUaa	nope. that's an industrial connecting an inner conch and helix.  hope this helped    EDIT  the reason why people wouldn't think it's an industrial is because usually they're straight barbells. these type of barbells are custom made. it looks nice, i think you should get it.|`|YCoicHnEaa	idk is it|`|yQprV7Tvaa	Yes.

Tzwg26ZAaa	Heeyyy i have that very same problem and i babysit kids on top of that!! people always say i look like I'm in grade 6 but I'm not!!! and it gets really annoying!! so these are some ideas of what you should do: Act more responsible (this will make others see your not so childish and your serious about your goals), Wear clothes that will make you seem mature (if you know what i mean), Where heals to make you look taller! and where make up whenever you can! Well those are  the only ideas that i could come up with! I hope i helped :)|`|RIbhvrBTaa	Umm grow???|`|tqIaTWkHaa	hollister, abercrombie... those are a little bit childish... bland type of brands    try shopping at H&M, or Urban Outfitters...|`|aa7b743c4d182915477624dc0095b01aaa	1. Try to act mature .If people laugh when you say your 14, don't try to prove them that your older. Be chill and just say "i am 14," and leave it at that.    2. Try dressing more grown up. Instead of hollister and abercrombie try free people, urban outfitters, H&M. Look for pieces that are not generic, but unique and reflect your personality.    3.And about make up.... You don't want to pile tons of it on, it will look like your just trying to hard. Instead, when you do you make up try to look natural and consentrate on one feature you want to hight light. benefits' "big beautiful eyes" kit is great for eyes.       And don't worry!! I used to have be like that, and then suddenly you hit a growth spurt and start looking your age!|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	Ride it out.  In a few years you'll be thankful.  Some people just look young no matter what.  I've always been a really skinny person so people assume that I'm 17 or 18, still.  (I'm 25)|`|SwVW0yrAaa	idk im the opposite.  hehe|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	Try to dress more mature, that stuff is kinda little kidish, and maybe your make up looks little kidish... Are you piling on the eyeliner? If you are- don't do that  Try to look how more grown up people dress/wear make up. Also start styling you hair in different ways|`|Gcvm5Wb4aa	There is nothing much you can do but do what your doing now. Tip: act like you don't care what people are saying. Did you know that if people think you don't care then they don't bug you about it cause they won't get a reaction?|`|71204fadefeb0aef75f4761be2bfbc09aa	Hey!  I did a study on height and one of the things I looked at was how to look your age if you're short. I'd love to help you out but you don't really describe yourself- what you look like etc. There's a lot more to it than your height.  If you want to talk more just contact me through my profile.

z8GbX4LXaa	sassy means : sometimes b**chy, and sometimes rude, but charming  quirky: is weird and square|`|RIbhvrBTaa	That you're a pain in the bedonkadonk...sorry, just trying to keep this site safe and censored for those little "kiddies" roaming around on Yahoo Answers. :0)|`|765eed0df3acc6032568a9c4bbd1f849aa	No, I think he is saying that you are different, and he likes you.  Young guys just have a hard time coming out and saying that.|`|M5XjqI40aa	A nice way of saying arrogant and weird.|`|RLK401pgaa	you know i've always wondered about these questions.  when the guy called you that why didn't you just ask HIM what he meant. everyone kinda has their own interpretations so its hard to tell exactly what he meant. but anyway, quirky is another word for weird, or odd. and sassy might mean snappish or something. i dont really know. i presume (ha ha dr. livingston) that if your not friends with him then they were not compliments...

3cZ4ZJPSaa	if you bleach the hair out, if you dont need to go out for that day, only lift it to a red/orange colour else when you put the brown back on it will go a khaki/green colour and look awful! lol. If you accidentally lighten it too much, put a light semi permanent ginger on it then dye it brown. When you bleach, you take out all the red/gold, and you need it in your hair to go brunette, even very light brown.   I dont understand why you need to do this, unless your going from a dark brown to a light brown - which it what i did yesterday! haha. This advice came from the hairdresser.|`|Q2HmWDURaa	yerp....wont come out like the brown on the box but close...did the same but in dark brown turned out browm hope i helped pls vote me as best|`|K3d5yd1Paa	It is very possible, i do not recommend it though especially if you are going to do it yourself. When you dye your hair back to brown your hair will be very dry and damaged!|`|dvY6UfiYaa	Yes but it will fry your hair.  CONDITION.|`|QPY5awssaa	wow... i dint know you could bleach hair and turn it brown.... hmm learn sumthin new er'day|`|a1esFJ53aa	Your pooor haiiir! You probably can do that but its kind of a big risk considering the hair will still be fresh from the bleach.     You'll also have to keep re-dying it brown, because your hairs natural pigment will be stripped with the bleach. So when your brown hair-dye fades, it will fade to a kind of dirty colour (its best to dye it a darker brown so it takes longer to fade) but you'll have to keep topping up the colour untill your hair has completely grown out natural again    Also there are risks of your hair being seriously dry and elasticy!!! you may have to cut some of it off (mine was great condition before it was bleached and then it got really dry)    It's kind of a big hassle if you're dying it for only a day! but if you're gonna do it, deep condition like crazy after, look after it the best you can, have it trimmed if it goes dry and appreciate being brown haired! (because  after bleaching once it goes that wierd orangey colour mid length with the top of your head going a banana colour and the ends being a yellowish colour, the strands of your hair being dry and stretchy, you'll appreciate how great your hair looks brown!) :D      UNLESS! YOU'RE A GUY! I just realised your name is Conor, in that case, if your hairs short, then dye it like crazy!!! because if it goes wrong it wont take long to grow back out :)|`|TdrpIkl4aa	be careful your hair might break,|`|o4NRcsAHaa	yes. anythings possible if you believe|`|u7n7jslRaa	no chance wigs are cheap enough ,|`|bxCJNImPaa	use a wig.
oX9hnJV1aa	A very fresh design idea! I suggest that you look for a local artist who suggests doing the dandelion without an outline. Wait for the suggestion.... dont make it yourself. Ask for opinions, sure, but dont suggest it. A dandelion could make an awesome tattoo if done correctly.   A calf would look nice. How about the lower back..right above the cleft of the buttcheeks? Now... thats funny!|`|3cCunajcaa	http://www.deviantart.com/ order=9&q=Dan...     there are some pictures for you.  i think it would look better on your back or leg rather than your arm.|`|H3PcFertaa	Cool image idea! Ya know, since it has such personal and fond memories that go with it, I'm thinking having that on your inner forearm would be kinda special, and would be right there for you to make you smile whenever you saw it. It would look great on your calf also, and your shoulder blade.  http://www.looksgreenlawncare.com/Dandel...  http://www.naturewatch.ca/english/plantw...  http://www.looksgreenlawncare.com/Dandel...  http://www1.istockphoto.com/file_thumbvi...  this is a cool image:  http://www.justintheloop.com/wp-content/...  http://www.kolumbus.fi/naoji/dandelion.j...  Take your idea and any images, drawings, photos etc. to your artist and see what he/she comes up with for drawing for a custom work for you. I think this will be a fine tattoo!~  good luck|`|84a92b794a6ae292684ad41ae82b80b4aa	10 points for understanding my love and respect with these opinions .   First Your name is not cool . Are you a grown woman ??????  I have 3 daughters / grown children / woman 18 24 25 yrs. old   Respect your self and body  ( PLEASE )   Second don't ask a guy what they think. We think with our D$$ks .  THIRD MOST IMPORTANT !!! I am a produce broker in NEW JERSEY   We are the dandelion Capital of the world.  FOR REAL !!!!!!!   Mike - Matt produce 856 691 8662 Richard.   You have a great idea , reason, & purpose for this tattoo. AMEN.  MY thoughts are .......  Hip or calf or foot classy spots.    Incorporate  the flower YELLOW the pointed leaves GREEN   Use the seed as a form of cloud .  Have a hand  holding dandelions   Part of grandpa will bring this whole tattoo together.   Don't look for a picture .... Just close your eyes , and talk to   GOD AND GRANDPA ... OK    ????????
mCEKMWTYaa	You should definitely go and talk to a reputable tattoo artist.  He/She could easily answer your questions!  Good luck!|`|JafLyLYgaa	Go show a potential tattoo artist, they will defientely be the ones to tell you.|`|xtYywJzVaa	i suggest clearing up the acne. and with acne it would be very painful|`|WR9NuZFiaa	All tattoos will stretch after time. Unless you have a big spike in muscle growth the tattoo wont get ruined if it's on your arms or shoulder. Ink might not hold so well depending how bad your acne is. It may also hurt more getting it. If it is real bad you should probably wait and try to clear your skin in.|`|tao83sDxaa	i know you want the tattoo, but i would put it off. acne is nothing to fool around with, if you were to get the dyes into a soar you would really be in big trouble. you can't introduce a another way of adding germs to what is already a small infection, it would only make things worse.|`|fYed2Crjaa	Maybe start using a 2% benzoyl peroxide lotion on the spot where you want to get your tattoo. It should help clear up any acne.|`|jeHTjvbaaa	Well, I sometimes get small bumps on my tattoo from acne every once in a long while and it doesn't effect the tattoo, as for severe acne, for one it could prevent you from getting the tattoo because the artist will not tattoo over big acne marks because the tattoo could become infected.  Try going to a doctor, I used to have HORRIBLE back acne but I have some pills that helps tons!  Also with the arm tattoo, I got mine when I had maybe 13 in arms, now they are about 18-19inc and the only issue I had was the fact that the ink faded a bit and I needed to get a touch up.  Like a guy above me, unless you have SEVERE muscle growth, like you start up on steroids, then the tattoo should stay the say design, just a little faded, but nothing a touch up cannot fix.  Good Luck!
ZGcNgRX0aa	i like both of the dresses to be honest, they are adorable and i want one. any way, since you have backne you can cover up it with concealer, just get mom to do it for you.   also since you dont have a fuller chest i think the purple dress will suit. I have a similar "probem" and i have a dress like the green one and it just makes me look funny. also the purple one is pretty. since the purple one is a higher cut you can create the illusion of breasts. try them both on with the bra you plan on wearing and see which you like better.   the purple dress has a really nice pattern on the chest, which will help with the illusion of breasts|`|jkLDzmiCaa	there really is no way to get rid of black acne right away, I really like the second one espcialy for a bar mitzvah- it more appropriate for that. and if you have a flat chest then the purple one will make it look alot better.   good luck!!! =) have fun!|`|z8GbX4LXaa	they are very cute  stuff the bra or wear a push up  I luv both of them  make sure they r not too revealing cause they might get offended at the party|`|mHv7nFxEaa	i think the 1st one is better! can't really help with the back acne except maybe wear your hair down if you have longish hair.|`|w5sIDn43aa	the second one will make your chest look bigger and i love them both a lot but you should get the second one|`|mE3AepBHaa	i love both of them but my fav is the first one.... i like the color and style........     i have back acne too and i havent found a way to get rid of  it sorry :(   im kinda flat too dont worry|`|a14b96b25b5bf9293d533f13874f2a6aaa	Nice choices, you have good taste. I like them both. I think either one would look great, they are both so cute.  I would use the same acne meds on my back that I use on my face. Have your mom or someone help you if you can't reach. You also can use coverup on the blemishes if you need to.|`|Ot2AERbcaa	just wash your face twice a day and get a nice tan. i would go with the greenish one if your flat chested because that type of dress really shows off your boobs to make them look bigger  but they both are pretty i like the greenish one better though but id have to see your body to REALLY make a choice:)  dont be nervous have fun good luck!:D|`|c1d312af4250951e942d357ba46d734caa	The second link wasn't loading so I couldn't see it, but the first one is very cute.  Who cares if you have a small chest.  So long as you wear a flattering dress, you'll look just as good as the next girl will huge boobs.  Infact, you can get away with strappy dresses like link one, and girls with big boobs can't because there's not enough support or thick enough straps to hide big bra straps.    You can get an acne-wash body wash to help with the bacne.|`|Vfc1UGnwaa	i would wear the greenish dress!! it is so pretty.  i dont think your chest matters, that has detaling up top :)  As for your Acne use Clean and Clear acne spot!!|`|RLK401pgaa	i really like both of those dresses. i kinda like the first one more though, because the second one is a little bit casual for a bar mitzvah. and i doesn't matter if your flat.

UODxrVKzaa	taking a shower isnt going to affect your tan. sometimes after tanning i'd shower and if i shaved my legs i noticed that it took a little bit of the tan off but i think you will be fine... go shower, you smell like tanning lotion!!!|`|USsDzaIsaa	Stop tanning.  Skin cancer is ugly.|`|urCMLUlYaa	Yes you can take a shower.  I tan in the morning after I work out.  I get home about 20 minutes after tanning and I take a shower as soon as I get home.  It doesn't rub off.|`|xBixbBxoaa	no you have to wait at least 6 hours before you take a showwer or it will get lighter and look uneven
sc4jNqjTaa	well i'd would do a smoky eye on the lid with some black eyeliner, and black mascara, and some pink blush to add some color to your face. for clothing i'd wear a pair of skinny jeans, and a pair of red ballet flats with a big buckle on them. i'd also get a plaid trenchcoat with some blacks and grays and chrimsons. with a black top underneath it, but not a tshirt or somthin more structured|`|Pyu4fQf4aa	hmm maybe with a little tawny- brown blush just to put some color in your cheeks and then you can do like any color of eyeshadow! try black eyeliner with maybe pink eyeshadow, but not obnoxious amounts of it just subtle.|`|PhkWt9vEaa	Makeup tips for brown eyes  http://www.makeupnotebook.com/makeuptips...

AA11562077	I'll personally never forget meeting a girl named Lulu who wearing a short leather trenchcoat in the swank Paris nightclub 'Castel'.  When we got out to her girlfriend's Rolls, she  turned out to be wearing just the trenchcoat, period.  Barbie may be jealous, but my guess is Lulu ain't.    If you're not up to that, or circumstances don't call for it, then a black cashmere turtleneck is always good, and hair up if it's longer, with simple pearl studs. Think Audrey Hepburn for dressed up, or Katherine Ross in 'The Graduate' if you want to be more casual. Skinny DARK jeans, or a short skirt (Tartan?) flats, boots, or heels -- but the open-toed heels one person suggested would definitely be skanky, and not in a good way.|`|st5reHVjaa	dress pants (black) heels (not uggs) bright flowy top.  if its warm, wear a skirt with colored tights and a tight fitting top. calf boots.      casual: flowy top, skinny jeans, calf brown boots|`|EfBMzCjaaa	a black or white shirt. blue jeans and heals|`|R6Z8onywaa	http://www.polyvore.com/trench/set?id=63...|`|VOAyAhsSaa	Dark pants, or slacks.. Black tights that only go to your ankles work GREAT. Underneath your jacket where a white or black shirt. Black boots with heels or pumps, with a fur lining are very beautiful for winter. Otherwise, nice leather ones that zip up would work. If you hav elong hair, put it in a ponytail, and add blush to your cheeks and a little mascara. Lip gloss helps. If you have short hair.. Don't be waring long trench coats. They don't match. If you have medium hair, a side cut and a little cute clip, such as a butterfly or dragonfly, on the side works GREAT. contact me for more fashion advice! :)|`|N6cuuDAmaa	a white blouse, DARK jeans, high-heeled boots, black big bulky beaded necklace!:D|`|snIMoXomaa	Skinny jeans. Flats. Knee high boots?    (:|`|BlZ6vJOAaa	striped black and white shirts, navy blue purses,|`|mR9ydwz5aa	a fancy bright colored shirt, skinny jeans, and heels/flats|`|VDmh1N3Aaa	A white ruffled shirt. Ruffles in front or on the collar and around the sleeves.    Grey and pink plaid pants (if you are thin) with black heels.     If not thin or big thighs and butt I would wear black pants with brightly colored heels.|`|pihAW3t4aa	white long sleeve  black skinny jeans  black shiny open toed heels|`|xi1Nl3zCaa	A cute short dress in a really fun color like this one: http://cgi.ebay.com/Vintage-60s-Mod-Pink...|`|2zOmOk8qaa	Gray is a neutral color, so if you pair the trench coat with a few pretty, bright accessories it should look fantastic. It could all depend on what you are wearing it for though, Ill assume casual.     I think a dark wash pair of jeans would be best and either a necklace or a brightly colored fashion scarf (maybe in pink or light blue?). You can add a fun belt if you wish. For the shoes, you may want something practical but cute. Try a pair of flats or if you would like to go for a rougher look wear a pair of converse that arent too badly worn.   Oh and of course youll need a shirt underneath, perhaps a cute black tank top? If you get hot and take off the trench coat it should still work with the outfit.   Just a smidge of makeup if you wish.     I hope that helped a bit.
4gcTZNZBaa	Ok wear leggings and a dress. Also know the names of the brands you wear cause they might ask.|`|zPFclJznaa	wear heels, a nice shirt ( that looks good on you ), and a skirt ( not a professional/ work one- a nice one )|`|7vfBu0x2aa	no i wouldn't weir that. weir a cute dress and heals.. it really deepens on how old you are and your style.|`|dF08mbFyaa	Hair down and in a headband so it isn't in your face. If your hair is naturally curly or wavy DO NOT straighten it. Instead, do what you can to enhance its body and curl. Don't wear any make up except for a bit of concealer or powder on your face where its needed. Your goal is to look like you aren't wearing make up. Make sure your lips are nice and moisturized and about a 1/2 month before you have had your eyebrows done professionally (be sure to tell them to keep your eyebrows as thick and natural but still shaped as possible). If you have plucked your eyebrows to be thinner, let them grow out (sucks I know, but can really make a difference). Where skinny jeans that are tight, but not too tight. You can wear modest high heals or nice flats. Wear a tank top that isn't too revealing- this is good: http://images.usoutdoorstore.com/usoutdo... make sure that nothing you wear has big logos on it. you could also wear a top like this: http://www.aspshop.net/upload/upimg5/Anv... that fits tighter. You can find a great one at American Apparel. if you are not allowed to wear jeans, wear leggings. That would look better with flats I think, but ankle boots would look GREAT. If you wear anything but what i suggest you will either stick out like a sore thumb or not showcase what they want to see correctly. If you have any more questions, leave your email and I will promptly give you advice. I have been a model for Elite Model Management for a while.    EDIT: Please do not wear a dress unless it looks just like:   http://store.americanapparel.net/rsa8347...  or a skirt like:  http://store.americanapparel.net/rsa7302...  (basically one that fits tightly, if you don't-- they won't see you being proud of your body or really see how you can look in your own clothes.)  If you contact me, I have several great ideas that showcase personal style AND shows them what they want.|`|Po6dgusAaa	wear a sundress or something with a big belt with flats or heels[preferably heels].dress like you somewhat care about fashion.

Leggings, heels and a tank top would be fine. Most dresses and skirts are not fitted enough to define your hips and waist.

SEUaBwHPaa	interesting... i have a nose piercing too, but it certainly did not take me 5 months to heal, maybe around 2.5 - 3 months?!  So, it could be an infection or something. have u gone to ur doctor to show it yet?  other than that, i recommend changing ur jewelry for safety reasons because the older one may contain an infection and are usually worn for only a certain period of time because of that reason.  i suggest using a jewelry that has a longer stem so that it doesn't press against your nose.  also, try using an anti-bacterial solution that you get when u get ur piercing done. If u don't have one, then you can try using Neosporin, or ask a local pharmacist for something similar.  hope that helps =) take care.

LBHJaqXoaa	If it's not getting any darker by now, it won't be getting any darker at all. Henna develops within 24 hours of taking the paste off.      I hope you didn't get black henna, either. Here's a website with the dangers of black henna.http://www.hennapage.com/henna/ppd/index...|`|WLuEIwp5aa	It usually takes a few hours for henna to really set, but that's if you're talking about real henna and not a chemical cocktail that can leave you with really horrible burns and a lifetime of health problems.    Just let it fade and never use black henna again.  You might not have had any problems in the past, but just because you're fine now doesn't mean your body isn't going to react really badly later.  Next time get natural henna, the kind that's greenish and stains your skin reddish brown, there's nothing at all to worry about with that and it definitely can leave behind a super dark stain.|`|fYed2Crjaa	It probably won't get too much darker, but you really shouldn't use black henna. I hope you used a dark brown henna because black is horrible for your skin. Both me and my brother got black henna tattoos and both of our tattoos caused our skin to bubble up around the tattoo. Mine was the worse I had a scar for about a year from it.

I can tell you from experience though the best mineral makeup I have used is Faerie Organic Minerals, they are light and airy, feel like your own skin, cover redness,acne and rosacea amazingly, stay put, absorb oils and leave a gorgeous glow. I recommend it to everyone I know. They even have a free sample kit so you can try it out first. It's exactly what you need having oily skin. You can see their site here..........http://www.faerieorganic.com

9a23xGojaa	you can always put highlights in your hair around the gray area if you don't want a permanent color you could just highlight it that wouldn't be too damaging and it would still fix the gray.|`|fqgbAVi9aa	loreal natural match is really non damging.<br>  <br>  i would stroooooooooongly recommend pureology products, especially the moisture line. beats redken by a long shot.|`|5KbCIEOTaa	Use highlights instead of dye.

My style has changed in so many ways over the years.  I'm 15 atm, but turning 16 next month. (:  Anyways. 5 years okay, my style was skater.

The years  before that i was just a little preppy kid. Ha, i mean i was young.  I didnt really know much about style. From age 13, to 14,  i think i was scene. I was probably a big POSER Scene kid, tho.  But hey AT LEAST, i'm ADMITTING that. Yeeah. Those were  the years of 2007 to 2008.  Well, after my 14th  birthday last year, i started getting more into the vintage/indie,  hipster type of style. So those were like 2008 to this year.

I'm only 14, so of course I dressed differently when I was 8 than when I do now.  But it's also changed over the last three years. When I was 11, I showed up for the first day of school wearing blue jeans with a light blue stripe down the side, and a lime green t-shirt, a pink shrug, and an orange hat.  The year after that, I don't think I payed much attention to what I wore ... I think it was loose jeans and a long sleeved shirt.  Last year on the first day I wore a yellow tank top, white zip up hoodie, light wash jeans, and white skateboard shoes with yellow and green strips on the sides.  This year on the first day, I wore a white tank top, blue and grey plaid blouse, grey jeans, and white sneakers. I usually wear jeans, hoodies, and beige boots now.|`|ALh5R37jaa	When i was 5, i wore terrible ugly clothes. Always matchy matchy things. Not much style.  When i was 10 it was worse, i wore all these clothes, that didn't match. Sweat pants and tshirts is all i wore. Never jeans.  Now i'm 15 and i wear the perfect outfits everyday. I tend to wear more stylish, less casual clothes. Always jeans, leggings sometimes, and flowy shirts.|`|80t10xWGaa	Oh jeez, yes.    When I was like 1-10 ( like most kids I didn't give a damn) I wore whatever my mom gave me.    When I entered sixth grade I suddenly started caring about how I dressed, I started with the normal entry designer brands like Abercrombie, AE, and Aeropostale.    Eventually in roughly seventh grade I went through the skater phase, where I wore strictly skateboarding clothes such as loose jeans made by Element, DC, Emerica, Fallen, etc.    Now I'm 17 and wear more cutting edge fashion clothes, (and I don't skateboard anymore) I shop at stores such as GUESS, Calvin Klein, Express, Macy's, Martin + Osa, etc.    So yes, my style's changed dramatically over my life.

bppjhIo1aa	If you don't want to keep having to straighten it every day then you can get a straight perm. It's like a normal perm except it keeps your hair straight for around 3 months. It can be a bit costly though.     Another option is to wash your hair really well with a heat shampoo, (try not to use conditioner though because it can leave you hair wetter for longer) then blow dry it. After that spray on some spray conditioner or heat protector. Then use some good quality hair straighteners on your hair.(it's OK if your straighteners make a little bit of steam though). Also try and work in layers of your hair, I use about 4 or 5. Afterwards you can spray in some hairspray or styling mouse to keep it in place.    I know straightening your hair everyday can be a pain though, especially if you have to got o school/work early in the morning. If I were you I would probably get a straight perm from your hairdresser, but thats just my opinion.    Hope this helped you.|`|s0TiTrd3aa	when you wash your hair, make sure you leave the conditioner in for over 5 minutes. if you want to straighten your hair, use a straightener (flat iron). if you're looking to buy one, BaByliss is a good brand name. (Just Google it to find out where to buy them).|`|yYJqYsAFaa	you should definitely buy the jilbere de paris for 59.99 dollars at sallys;its ahmazinq=] i love itt & it heats up to 450 degrees it works fantastic DONT BUY CONAIR! thats a big NO NO! lol hope this helped|`|FlzaKK3Gaa	So, instead getting rid of the frizz you want to maintain it?  HUMM..Air dry, fluff it around with your hands until completely dry.....? (1st plan)  If that does not work, then hair spray, product called "big sexy hair" for volumizing and a diffuser on your blow dryer. (2nd plan)  If you want to straighten it, then a flat iron is the best way with some type of serum.  I would recommend Moroccan Oil ( a little) and flat ironing it in small sections at a time.  Word of caution:  use a professional flat iron, ie...CHI, GAI, HAI, CROC, Cricket, Paul Mitchell.( all flat irons)

AJEYXzIUaa	i would say pressed power provides much more coverage and last long, based on that you are putting more powder on your face.   i always used cover girl as a store brand, i switched to clinique and my face broke out so bad, and wouldn't go away for 6+ months!    good luck!|`|Fb0Ch8Kxaa	i've never tried loose powder but i use pressed powder and it works really well. i use the MAC studio fix powder plus foundation.    http://www.maccosmetics.com/product/spp....|`|VesSGgCGaa	i prefer pressed powder bcuz   sometimes loose powder falls  on ur clothes or u can c the shadow  of the powder on ur face and i hate  that ugh and i looove mines its  from merle norman but a drugstore brand  that i recomend is loreal   i also love this loreal true match  http://www.beautyencounter.com/071249033...
lU8e0VQFaa	If your hair is not blonde naturally there is no way to make it blonde that is NOT permanent (also even if you are blonde you can't lighten your color without bleach). To go blonde you MUST bleach, which is not only permanent, it is also very damaging. It's also HIGHLY recommended that you go to a professional for bleaching since it can be difficult to do correctly and without burning all your hair off. If you only want to be blonde for a month then bleach it and a month later use a demi permanent dye to go over it.|`|B97ayTJ3aa	I dont think thats possible. Bleach is permanent.|`|jD5pRtf3aa	Hey ... . Look at these below links . I hope you will be happy after you visit the web sites.  It would give you a better idea as to your question.    IMO, One of the best website for all questions concerning Hair-   http://abe5.com/9cx  My hairdresser uncovered this amazing website for hair related problems:  http://shrunk.it/wx2fgq|`|c4U2KvoZaa	If you want a color that only lasts a day to a month, I'd usually say find a good semi permanent color, but that's hard to find in blond.  The way you get blond hair is to bleach out the pigment, so that's usually permanent.  But you can always try a semi permanent and the try coloring it back a little darker than your usual color in about six weeks.  That should off set it and make it look almost exactly like it was.  Hope this helps.
K70Hkq5haa	Sounds like rosachea.<br>  Or some form of psoriasis.<br>  I'd see a dermatologist if I were you.<br>  It also may be an allergy.|`|0fd5351208abf7288012c15a62c9bdb3aa	I`ve heard of this happening when your blood pressure is high,my whole face will turn red though.You might want to go have it checked just to be safe,and if thats not it then maybe its just the way your face is colored.Good Luck!
PIuEcCRPaa	yeah it hurts but after a minute or so you can handel it.|`|kCdISEGqaa	It hurts, but, it is not the most tender part of the body.  Don't listen to people who tell you it is not painful.  All tattoos hurt, some are just more tolerable, the outer arm being one of those spots.  The top of the arm (bicep area) is more tender than the outer arm, the inner arm is very tender, and the closer you get to the elbow or shoulder the more tender it gets.  Tolerance makes a big difference, some people handle it better, but, they all hurt when getting it done.|`|zlXofrG4aa	Different parts of the body hurt differently on different people.  What a thought.<br>  More than likely the inner elbow, or near it, is going to hurt like hell.|`|QikvnTnqaa	That would be one of the more tender parts to get a tattoo. Compared to your upper arm. But if you want it, GO FOR IT! That pain of a tattoo isn't that bad. Get it! :D|`|lbskrF6Raa	I have Faith written in old English just below the crease for my elbow. <br>  it did not hurt at all when i was looking at the tattooist doing it through the mirror, when i looked at it directly it tingled a little bit.<br>  (the tattooist was holding my arm fairly tight as well to keep me still... so my fingers were numb so that probably helped)<br>  when getting a tattoo in this position done it doesn't hurt as much cause it isn't directly over bone!!|`|HZHvtI8faa	not bad at all. the final wipe with the disinfectant stuff is the most painful, but even that is nothing. just grow a set and man up.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Very bad!|`|GmghrL4Iaa	how bad?<br>  so bad.
zc47c39daa	Don't dye it black.<br>  When a persons hair color isn't relatively close to black and they dye it black, usually it looks bad. Fake, etc.<br>  <br>  I have naturally dark reddish brown hair- and I even dyed it black and it came out horrendous- the part that stunk the most is that I couldn't get the color out and had to deal with black hair for months. Now my hair has faded to it's natural color, but still- I DO NOT ADVISE IT!<br>  <br>  Do a dark brown at most, but don't dye it black brown because it'll come out jet black. :( (It almost looks like synthetic hair when it's fake black)<br>  Hope I helped!|`|AA11702728	Yeah I think you would suit black hair, if you're really unsure about it maybe try one of those wash in wash out colours first...if you don't like it it will just wash out and if you do you can dye it properly!<br>  I do like your hair red tho!!|`|GXm20LUKaa	Can't say cause i couldn't see your pic ... sorry.
p5kzRDIpaa	the only thing you can do is let it grow, and just wait! <br>  be patient, and your top layers will soon be long enough to wear extensions if you wanted to<br>  tell the hairdresser, you want to grow your hair and do not want any length cut off, but you want the dead ends etc (trim) so your hair grows better|`|4ZzLtY9Saa	this is the thing about getting a short styled hair cut there isn't much you can do with it except grow it or get it cut shorter|`|31bd301492d159191dacd31abd1b95e8aa	I think you should get a mohawk, just like your avatar!|`|mYDZHQDPaa	shave it off
DOcjGDVQaa	Yes, you definitely could.    I suggest you call or email some reputable modelling agencies and send some photos. send them a full body photo, a profile photo and a face photo. dont do any silly posing.    As a matter of fact, i think your face is probablyperfect for the brands you would like to represent. Height is a very big factor in modelling as well and you have it.    Please pursue this and tell us how you go.    When talking to an agency or going to a casting your attitude and presentation is just as important as your looks.    Some people think modelling is an unreachable goal, but it employs 10s of 1,000s of people. it is just diffcult to become a famous model! It is good for some extra money for little hours. Just dont letit interfere wth your school work you can alway do it when you finish high school.    (I have worked a a model and also in advertising)|`|4gcTZNZBaa	yeah i think you could.  Go to an audition    Please answer my question, I am trying to choose my best modeling pic for my comp card , its on the top of my questions.|`|n0TBUVnFaa	No, you look girly.  GAYY ALERT!  :P|`|AA10451072	No|`|FSkSOafCaa	yyeessss!!!!!!|`|5urfAbazaa	maybe... but if you want to be a model for abercrombie or any of the companies that are owned by abercrombie... you have to work at one of its stores such as: Abercrombie and Fitch, abercrombie, Hollister, Ruehls No. 925, or Gilly Hicks.|`|PXnqbABlaa	umm..not rlly  u gotta be hella hott|`|RIbhvrBTaa	Learn how to spell the stores that you want to model for...then maybe you'll have a chance.|`|y2cNLD4iaa	no|`|4lHJEq5Haa	nope!|`|ZPrrYW0baa	you should put up some pictures...that would help. lol    the first link doesn't work, and the second all of the pictures are too small to tell what you even look like.
RIbhvrBTaa	I don't like them....they make girls look like 5 year olds...|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	I think it makes them look younger, and i wish i could cut my hair like that, but my boyfriend would get mad lol|`|QPY5awssaa	i think it's very attractive and VERY sexy. Some women can pull it off without getting the whole hardcore dyke look and when they do it can be a big turn on. I think it makes you look a lil younger.|`|qsInDQUhaa	I think it makes you look more older  guess....less mature though|`|c98c60d71dbb85f0335e5c7fc391ddd3aa	I think pixie cuts are very cute.My 18 year old niece recently had her hair cut in a pixie style and it made her look more mature.|`|mweM8qoKaa	Cute hair cut(:  Similar to this.  Probably younger, yet more mature.  :]    http://media.photobucket.com/image/pixie...  Hope this helped(:|`|xBFF8qDmaa	I think they can make a teenager look more mature and older. But sometimes pixie cuts only work with certain types of face shapes. The picture you put would more than likely look good on any face shape though. It would just make you look more mature.  :)
UA6mt9ESaa	i dont know about spiral but when i was 5 n i got my ears peirced it was really gross cuz i was wearing little spuds and then the skin grew all over them so the doctor told me to twist them so the dont get covered in skin but it might be difrent with spirals   u should probbaly ask your doctor if its ok
UODxrVKzaa	it means you are growing in some way or another.. a lot of people have them, but you can get lotion that will make it less noticeable. i use cocoa butter specifically made for stretch marks. they sell it at wal-mart for like 5 bucks|`|Q2HmWDURaa	i heard about this that you dont need to be fat to have stretch marks!!!i know!! if you have a big butt thats whats causing it or if your losssing weight..|`|0e27a736d12fa17e74fd3387bd95aa93aa	Stretch marks are caused by rapid growth. This is not always due to pregnancy or being fat. It can be a normal but rapid growth spurt. 15, if you are a boy, would be a common time for this to happen.|`|4dGfTmjGaa	it means that you are getting skinnier and that your weight changes a lot|`|IOGPax5naa	You toned up, or maybe your legs grew a bit.  Most every girl I know has those, and we're pretty much all average physic.  Sadly, it's one of the normal things in life no one tells you about ...|`|1TradJBIaa	i have the same problem lol. Its supposed to go away as you age. Its caused just because during adolescense you grow really rapidly and it literally just stretches your skin faster than it can produce new cells.

onKfEYL0aa	My hair is dark brown and so is my beard. My younger brother who is 23 has dark brown hair, but his beard is brown, red, and blond. His has always been that way.     I was at my doctor's office a few weeks ago. He has a beard and he was telling me that he had gray in his since he was a teen. I told him about my brothers and he said it is not uncommon for a guy to have a multicolored beard. In my brother case, I think it may have to do with genetics. My mom has a red tint to her dark brown hair. I'm sure my brother got his red beard from my mothers side of the family.     There is a web site called beards.org that I like. There is a guy in one of the galleries that has brown hair on his head, and his beard is red and blond.     I hope I was able to help you.

f5KqrYXZaa	You probably could, but to pull off skinny jeans you have to be really skinny. Sadly, too many people think they can pull it off when they really don't. Problem with skinny jeans is that they make your bum look really huge since they are made to make very small bums look bigger. Wearing a long top will hide that though.|`|igrdohopaa	Sure, why not (=|`|NRR4q2g3aa	hmm i really can't decide because alot of people carry their weight differently|`|1gXo8oHtaa	People think that skinny jeans are for skinny people.

TYx7b1zvaa	Google it.. There is a way to part it .. Like down the middle.. Then part those in half. Then one more time ... Then weave your comb in and out of your hair creating strands above the comb and some below the comb.. The strands above you dye .. You can make them thicker or thinner as you want. Dye the strands..

Unless you are celebrity shaped they can be a tad awkward fitting. I normally wear a 26. I put them on in a  26, way too big in the waistband, but very tight in the legs. 25 were almost right in the waist, way too tight in the legs, and 27 was massive in waist, and sorta fit the legs (a little tight still?)<br>  I'm a fan to some extend, they look nice on other people. they need to make there mens line a lot better though. They are great for plain and simple jeans, not the most cutting edge brand out there though.|`|w2evN22Yaa	OMG, So freaking HOT. I like the wash, a lot. Now I'm a fan haha.

Put ordinary rubbing alcohol on a bit of soaked kleenex and hold it onto all those lil pimples at once for about a minute or 2.  Then don't dry it, just go about your business.  Leave it alone.  The alcohol is very drying and will stop it in its tracks b4 they turn into regular pimples and not only that, the alcohol will dry them out completely.<br>  <br>  Of course if you do it once or twice more during the entire day, you'll have even faster results.  Every nite b4 u go to bed (earlier in the evening), do the alcohol bit whether or not u yet have pimples again.  In this way, you can keep them away.  As soon as your skin is clear, u can apply a little of any kind of moisturizer lightly in the morning if needed.|`|zEFSTNi7aa	you probably have milia.

I would also wear black leggings instead of white because it would go better together... Not so much whiteness. I would not wear just the dress with boots either. The dress is summery for starters and its winter. Boots are for winter and not for summer, so if you want to wear it as a summery outfit then wear it with sandals (or flats if you can get them) or wear it with leggings.<br>  <br>  Edit: The moccasins will look really weird with leggings and that dress. No offense, but the dress is more of a beach dress than a dress to be worn with leggings or boots. It would look really cute if you were at the beach and had it on top of your bathing suit or wore it with summery shoes.  Maybe save it for the summer time and try something different for Friday?|`|4cFCToQNaa	too plain add something like a belt,necklace<br>  did you try that dress,skinny jeans,uggs,belt,& a tote bag.<br>  hard to visualize but i think it would work.|`|zpo0sDTraa	those two together do not go!

Current predictions suggest that it is unlikely to become available to the public for at least ten years.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The name of the process is a little misleading as it really refers to cell therapy rather than true cloning. Once perfected it would involve taking a small sample of tissue from the scalp and then creating a culture that would allow the follicle cells to multiply. The theory is that the few sample cells would multiply to become several hundred thousand that could then be injected back into the scalp to create several thousand new hairs.<br>  <br>  There is one major issue:<br>  - There is no certainty that the replicated cells can develop into hairs.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - There is no guarantee that the new hairs will grow to the same thickness, color or direction as the existing hair coverage.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  - There needs to be certainty that the cloned cells do not introduce serious health problems such as the growth of cancerous tumors.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Clearly hair cloning offers exciting possibilites for the treatment of hair loss in the future but for now, you'd best stick with the more limited treatments that at least are currently available.

This is what I know from my dental visits.<br>  <br>  I currently have clear ones on top and metal ones on bottom.  Check out pictures on my site to see how they look on me.|`|7qTKREOmaa	normal trust me. with clear ones you can see food and everything. plus they dont always stay clear|`|0XUt7MHHaa	get the silver ones. the clear ones aren't all that cute anyway. the silver ones usually suits everyone.|`|rXInAcURaa	dont get clear, get CERAMIC braces. they arent much more expensive, heres the diff:<br>  <br>  metal:<br>  <a href="http://www.kiferdentalspecialist.com/images/braces/metal-braces.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.kiferdentalspecialist.com/ima...</a><br>  <br>  ceramic:<br>  <a href="http://www.seaofsmiles.com/images/ceramic.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.seaofsmiles.com/images/cerami...</a>|`|pqit18wBaa	The metal regular ones.

I have been to france and i was never asked that. heck i find that here in the USA. people who do not take a bath everyday.|`|0aXRDfOLaa	Is it a joke ? The French are like everybody, they wash everyday. The legend which says that they don't wash and that the women don't shave their armpits comes from the time the Americans were in France after the liberation. There was no food, no soap, nothing. The French had an other thing to do rather than wash or shave :  EAT ! lol|`|kJslw28Qaa	some people think it's strange to bathe so often. however, bathing too often will cause problems- you're constantly getting rid of the natural oils your skin and hair need to stay healthy.|`|ZTZBItU0aa	Everybody i know bathes everyday. You're not odd at all. I didn't realize the french didn't do that.|`|brHHawzFaa	ooh what perfume and soap is it? lol<br>  well i also heard some french women dont shave their armpits maybe they just think differently of hygiene? alot of people i know don't take a shower everyday they do it every other day....its basically the same but i just like the feeling of being clean everyday before bed. so no ur not weird|`|WDLnNm7Maa	:s<br>  <br>  Uhh that is weird..

KLz2Q3K3aa	i like almay. works good for me.|`|7tnb4On2aa	Honestly?   The best makeup remover is a bottle of coconut oil for 2 bucks that you get at the grocery store.

YhnY09JQaa	Hello. <br>  First off, big brown eyes are beautiful! <br>  You could start with a foundation, to even everything out. Because you have long lashes, and I don't know if they are already curled, if they aren't try curling them. Instead of wearing a brown or green liner try using a black, apply it just under you water line (along your bottom lash line) and if you feel comfortable put some along your top lash line. Then you could take some shadow (any colour) but because you have pale skin I would suggest a gold or brown colour. Lighty flick it on, more intense colour on your lid and lighter towards you eyebrow. Then put on a little bit of mascarra (not to much or it would look to heavy). TO finsh off but a light not to intense LIP GLOSS. Not lipstick. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped you...<br>  <br>  If you are interested for nighttime wear I would try and do a smokey eye. Go to this link for an instructional video on how to do it: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqawCx99mOQ&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XqawCx99m...</a><br>  <br>  For a picture on the school look I was telling you about visit this link:<br>  <a href="http://media.photobucket.com/image/eye%20%20looks/luvr301/louieandsceneries044.jpg?o=89" rel="nofollow">http://media.photobucket.com/image/eye%2...</a><br>  <br>  Just add the brown shadow.<br>  <br>  IF you need an idea on how to apply a nice eyeliner look that won't smudge here is a video: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bJQdOd1hc&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_bJQdOd1...</a>|`|kPmzj4Rcaa	i'd suggest maybe mascara brown for a natural look, or black to make them stand out more, and either brown/black eyeliner [ depending on the color of mascara ], with some really nice lipgloss, but you can always change the color of your eyeliner to make yourself stand out, such as glitter eyeliners, or blues/greens/purples ect ?|`|BXVyCQZFaa	With brown eyes like that, I'd say a bit of liquid bronzer sounds good. Also, something new to try is maybe a stick eyeliner in metallic white-pink. They're a little hard to find, but in a makeup line like Sephora you'll be sure to find something. Also, look at Urban Decay, because there HAS to be something you'll love. A visible gold liner and light white eye gloss (L'Oreal) would look pretty nice too, I'll wager.|`|IXsEk7MPaa	I  used to hve same probs on wat makeup to wear to skl to cause i dnt wanna look over made up but now i hve figured out how to keep it subtle but look great 2.<br>  <br>  1.

hYu1bczlaa	Well, considering you're wearing black, you should definitely add some color, it's PROM, it is suppost to be a fun night, so maybe do a gold or silver eye, a red lip? Try something a little dramatic, not too dramatic though! Maybe if you're a little scared on doing you're own make-up, go to a near-bye make-up store like Sephora or M.A.C. They can give you a great make-up job, maybe even a new look?|`|syVPYmXWaa	well it is still prom so dont do anything crazy, but you can do like a really light pink/or whatever color you like eye, then it would look nice..is your dress to the floor? or can you see your shoes?

Most women can find a shade of pale pink that looks good on them. And many blondes look lovely in shades of peach, nude neutrals and soft coral colors. It all depends on what looks best with your skin tone. Darker colors can tend to look harsh on blondes, but if you have smaller lips you might want to avoid darker colors all together. Try to avoid colors that have too much orange in them as this can look funny with blonde hair. The good thing is that the trend right now is to bypass lipstick in favor of a pigmented gloss. This will create the appearance of fuller lips and you can even purchase lipgloss with plumping formulas.|`|TuBzc1R5aa	This:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wonderwall.com/#wallState=0__/movies/In-the-Buff-772.gallery%3F%26rnd%3D1235575171389" rel="nofollow">http://www.wonderwall.com/#wallState=0__...</a><br>  <br>  p.s. try not to say like so much. it's annoying to whoever is listening.|`|FVWvN07xaa	Stop saying like, jeez.<br>  <br>  like you look like a tranny like yer|`|yimfu0gOaa	like you really should like go like f**k like yourself like cha' like word like girlfriend|`|y1jan1w1aa	who cares?|`|AaYEgDwWaa	Like idk what you should Like wear, Do somthing Like new.

It scrubs off all the dead skin and afterwards use a lotion like Curel, it doesnt make your face oiley <br>  <br>  <br>  if it is on your body get the lotion Eucerin idk how to spell it <br>  <br>  its something like that but also a body wash scrub helps take away the dead skin|`|9iphkDSTaa	Use a facial scrub to eliminate the nasty stuff (I like St. Ive's Apricot Scrub) and use a facial moisturizer like Neutrogena Oil Free Moisturizer plus SPF 15 to keep the nasty stuff away.|`|dv8267AAaa	Yeah if you use a soap bar, it will give you bumps on the side of your face.

fC81Q0kTaa	What material and finish (leather or suede or fabric.....)?<br>  <br>  Leather can be cleaned with a cream or lotion leather cleaner and a soft cloth (if it needs more cleaning try saddle soap first.)  That should make it look better.<br>  <br>  For the velvet, clean with a slightly damp cloth and then run a lint brush over it to get the nap right.  <br>  <br>  To make it "stiffer" you may be able to stiffen it from the inside by lightly spraying the fabric lining with a spray starch, filling the inside with wadded up plastic bags to maintain the shape you want, and letting it dry.

I think that he could just wear a black tux with white shirt and then if you are accessorizing with red then a red flower...or like you said a black tux with zebra under.|`|ZpR57jbBaa	wear a zebra print tie!!|`|CIQYv6cLaa	k well if this guy is only your friend and you wanna keep it that way don't go so revealing like in the first picture or maybe he'll be drooling..... also i think zebra is a good idea maybe he should do a white tux with black accesories like a watch and/or hat and stuff or vise versa <br>  <br>  hope i helped!!|`|c1MCOG3Faa	ummm I love animal prints but i think for prom you should wear solid colors :) but if you choose the animal print then make sure to not get another thing that has an animal print|`|NGFxmgUEaa	Cute =] no zebra for bf, black suit red tie|`|dDsoZ98Oaa	get him to wear a white suit with a zebra print/red tie!

cYlcZH7Aaa	wow kmb141995 is conceited and ignorant.<br>  she doesn't even know what armenian is. LOL<br>  no i dont know any.|`|MrPwK9s7aa	What? Do you mean American? if so i know me. And im gorgeous. Lol.
IuG0fgg2aa	I am definitely sure that the Sidekick Gekko is the newest Sidekick. I like how the Sidekick LX look but I don't really like how the Sidekick Gekko look.|`|CoKIxt4Eaa	Im not sure which is newer, ut I prefer LX to be honest. It just generally looks nicer.<br>  <br>  :D
NCweVQQwaa	I dont see nothing wrong with it but I didnt read your question before it. I mean I got my nose pierced when I was 12. atleast its not like your tongue or something. I met this 13 year old with her tongue. And thats bad. I dont see nothing wrong with piercings. I mean yeah they scar. But seriously. Its a scar thats like a wee little circle. I dont know. I dont think its stupid. Its not like you cant take it out if you dont like it.|`|rHKW1CJJaa	no. i would be like look at this little kid trying to look grown.<br>  peace:)|`|5P3cHR4Taa	Looks much better on a pig.|`|zKyy1gE2aa	No, you're too young, and with any piercing on the face, you risk a chance of scaring. I wouldn't do that to yourself. Just get another ear piercing.|`|Efn4lj5vaa	absolutely not, the younger you are the trashier you look.<br>  sorry if thats too harsh, thats just my opinion.|`|WPd4MYt6aa	No, it wouldn't look right on someone that young. Maybe when you're older.|`|bVr6wvcWaa	no it would look UGLY!!!|`|qF4S56THaa	I know a few 7th graders with lip rings.<br>  It looks good on them but it really depends on your style.<br>  Personally I wouldn't do it though.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090224163301AAnFi56&r=w">http://ca.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	no, it would look ridiculous for a 7th grader to wear a lip ring... especially when you are in 7th grade you still look like a child. Try growing up first :)|`|bf3ikOv8aa	no. it would look like your parents are crackwhores and like you live in a carboard box behind the cinema.|`|S5S1EP8saa	i definetly wouldn't|`|Ld1oUCvwaa	No.|`|rpVQpJA7aa	I don't think so...it would look trashy for your age.

For a drugstore brand iron, it works pretty well. So if you want something less expensive, it could be a good choice for you. I also love Tresemme's "thermal creations heat tamer" spray. It helps with damage, flyaways, and it smells REALLY good lol! Oh and I always go to the website below when I want to try a new product.|`|VTF3urxZaa	GHD are the best ceramic hair straighteners.<br>  And GHD Heat protection spary is also a very good investment.<br>  <br>  In australia there abouts 300$ for the straightner and 70$ for the spray but hey!! it's your hair we're talking about... the products have to be good.|`|llznar2Gaa	Chi is the best at least that's what I heard and it's just awesome!<br>  and try the Chi 44 iron gurad protection spray!
4w361g8Laa	No...it may take care of some of the yellowy tones if this toner is a pale violet color however it will more than likely to do nothing to the pink. The reason they have faded to pink is probably because when the stylist initially did the red, she bleach those pieces and bleached them too much. Reds tend to fade some anyway (just the nature of the color) but if you are doing something like red highlights, she should've only lifted your natural color to a reddish or orangey color to get the best results, not the yellowy color your currently seeing. Basically she over processed your hair so it's not holding the red as well as it could. To get the pink out, you will probably have to go to a salon and have it bleached out or just wait till it grows out. Don't try to do it on your own.|`|DRb4Qlypaa	No. With pink it will get lighter, but it will not go away. You will have to bleach over the toner. The best thing to do is to wait a few weeks before you try anything, toner on bleach is going to fry your hair.
K2QwEM4raa	Hair should grow about one have inch per month. Good site to visit has already been listed above.|`|qYgXwYXNaa	1 1/2" it take months, unless u like spiky hair. for a round face; the best hairstyle can be anything but if u cut a fringe aswell, it will lk amazin|`|TYx7b1zvaa	MM this was kinda hard..

HzjeKsDJaa	go emo<br> <br> <br> .
AA11627323	It's possible that they cut it or were branded, but it sounds like it is probably a white tattoo.  White tattoos show up really light and can look kind of like scars.  They can look pretty awesome.  Just protect it from the sun and they normally take better if you have fair skin.|`|ZrgjGMM6aa	use henna if you dont want a tattoo i love it.. it stains the skin for like 2 to 3 weeks .. i use it all the time and its easy to use its kinda like using an icing tube.... or if you have it available you can get airbrushing done but its more expensive and in my expirence lasted only 2 days.<br>  <br>  if the tattoo is light brown or brownish colour it could be henna or a brown tattoo|`|prlMQgDLaa	I think what you are talking about is the new tattoos that are uv
AA11627323	I just got my second tattoo.  Its a pretty good size lioness next to my hip bone.  It definitely hurt, but I managed to sit through it for over 3 hours with just a couple bathroom breaks.  My artist said that women tend to take stomach tattoos much better than men.<br>  <br>  The most important thing is to remember to breathe!  It's really easy to tense up and forget.  Eat something an hour or so before you go.<br>  <br>  Then just relax and try to distract yourself.  Time will fly by.  It's a bit of a rush, and you should enjoy it and be excited when you see it finished.  You will forget the pain quickly.<br>  <br>  It's bearable of course.  If it wasn't people wouldn't want to get tattooed again.  After the first one, you will be looking forward to the second!|`|DCWxYc4haa	You just have to get in a calm head space and remember to breathe.  the pain isnt too bad.  it hurts  but its easily something you can push aside and work through.  I had a friend with me to talk to and that made it easier to ignore the sting.|`|6o4iqjPgaa	yes... its gonna hurt... but since u are probably be expecting a hell of a lot of pain... ur gonna find is not AS painful as they say it is.. <br>  so dont worry about that<br>  and dont hold ur breath that makes it hurt a hell of a lot more... and just watch TV if u can.. or listen to music.. talk to the guy doing it|`|iN03HNdgaa	Of course everyone has a different pain thresh-hold, so tis hard to say exactly how much it will hurt.  The nearer it is to the bone, the more it seems to hurt.  IF you can position so its a little way off the bony area, if will be less painful.  Honestly tho, its not that bad.  Try and take someone with you to talk to and distract you from the whole thing.  Most good tattoo artists will have a joke with you to relax you.  Dont stress its not so bad.  The first couple of minutes are the worst, then your body seems to realease more adrenaline or something and the pain seems to subside and its all cool.  I had a large one done on my lower back a month or so ago, and it was ok.  It took over 3 hours, and by the end I was hardly feeling a thing.  Good luck, I hope it all goes well!  I love my tattoos, although I have them where I can hide them if I want to.  Too many people get the wrong idea about tattoos and the people that have them.......|`|4cy8XQd6aa	i just got my first in pretty much the same location. im not afraid of piercings and stuff but i was SO nervous. the guy thatdid it was wayy chill and hopefully yours will be too. he just calmed me by being like wow okay its not a big deal youll be done in like 5 minutes. and i was. its not painless, but unless its on your actual hip bone it just felt similar to someone drawing really hard with a pen.<br>  its worth it.<br>  tryyyy not to concentrate on that part of your body, and probably dont look.|`|OXOHoISraa	I think you can take it. People really work themselves up. It is really more annoying that painful in my experience, particularly if it is small (painful after 4-5 hours. absolutely.)
a3T6kIawaa	its not painful. do it!

aeKqoAfnaa	No, they are not if you are on a tight budget.<br>  <br>  Those shoes are not one of a kind/I have to have them type of shoes.  Even though they are really cute! You can easily find a shoe similar for less.  Also, consider how many times you will wear this type of shoe.  It's not really an investment piece either.<br>  <br>  Hope I've helped. :)|`|QMYNU9uNaa	Definitely not! They are really cute but I think you can easily find something similar for much cheaper.

And I tried for dresses that are at a decent price, so all of these are under $70 I think.

YOU'RE TOO YOUNG!<br>  Oh, all right!<br>  Always, always, always wear simple but elegant clothing.  You don't have to be flashy but you do have to look nice.  You're going to be dancing so make sure you can move freely.<br>  Makeup?  Sure - but makeup should always accent rather than hide you.  You should look like you aren't wearing makeup.  I didn't say that it should look leave you looking like you normally do.  I said that it should not be obvious.  That means no weird eyeliners, no big red blushes.  I think you understand.<br>  I hope you enjoy your dance.|`|WDLnNm7Maa	When i was in grade 6 and it was my first dance.. i remember putting on makeup and spraying perfume and making my hair nice! Now that i am in grade 8 my friends and i look back and we were like we are such dorks:) LOL..For our dances i sometimes wear sweats and a sweater and i still get asked to dance.....All i have to say is don't go overboard! Wear skinny jeans, a cool t-shirt maybe a scarf, and flats, wear your hair straight or curly. If you do wear makeup only wear like sparkle eye shadow. You don't want to look like your trying to hard because the older kids will make fun of you|`|XMV8frmjaa	haha. at my middle school, it was a joke. about 10 social rejects went to a cheap party in the gym.<br>  <br>  anyway, your school might be different. its probably fairly casual, so i guess just wear a not-too-fancy dress or a skirt and a nice shirt.|`|inovFfB7aa	aw. i remember my first dance :) haha.. <br>  <br>  Macy's has good dance dresses. Or just look for a cocktail dress at jcPenney's or anywhere else. DEFINITELY wear flats!! dancing hurts your feet soo much. lol, and do a dramatic makeup look, it will be dark, and it will look amazing. ! hope you have fun!!!|`|zUXCCpJ1aa	wear blue mascara<br>  <br>  where the latest trend.
GpFqItSvaa	Well, believe it or not, they sell tons of Yo Gabba Gabba stuff at Hot Topic. I have a two year old niece who adores it (it IS adorable!!

YES, they know they're gorgeous...but they might not know they're VAIN.|`|MwvA8v17aa	true. people just want to be comforted & told theyre pretty .. because they say they want honesty and the truth, but lets face it they are asking for compliments.<br>  <br>  help? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Aoke_GcPoDnYBezCi5isJtXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304173427AAy85jA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|MbFS6XFQaa	I agree with you partially. I agree that it is rather pointless, but not because the person "knows" they're gorgeous or ugly, but because everyone has a different standard of beauty, as unbelievable as the media makes it seem. <br>  But the people that ask those questions don't know that, so they're hurt when someone calls them ugly even if everyone else calls them pretty.
HzjeKsDJaa	wear brown contacts<br> <br> <br> .|`|LXxxAzIqaa	There is such a thing as ugly blue eyes?|`|sZMa0s7Baa	Don't do that!! Those things never look real. You should just bring out the blue with black mascara and eyeliner (make it look natural though) and your eyes will look beautiful! Also try some brownish goldish eyeshadow.|`|sxyo17Zsaa	WTF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! iv'e always wanted light blue eyes!!! :P how on earth can they be ugly?? do u know how rare they are??? you should be sooo happy to have such awesome eyes like that and know that not alot of people have them!! dont hid them away!!|`|iL3UuW5qaa	commmon why do you say that you have ugly light blue eyes???<br>  don't you know that the eyes is the window of the soul?<br>  why should you hide them?<br>  or are you just being vain?|`|0JcJedLcaa	uhhm ur lucky u have blue eyes. theyre always gorgeousss. dont be ashamed. so many people would kill for them.|`|bc0NTxNUaa	I don't really get how light blue can be ugly, but you get any kind of contact lenses from your eye doctor. If you don't actually need contacts to help you see, you would still need to see an eye doctor to get them fitted since eyes are different sizes. Then the doctor can get you a brand and color that is in your price range and with all the insurance and everything. There are some downsides to contacts, like they can be expansive and an annoying hassle. One time in the middle of a big math test in school both of my contacts fell out and I wasn't allowed to leave the room to put them back in. I had to trash them; 50 bucks in the trash can. <br>  But if you think it would be worth it, then go right ahead.|`|94a46d94405353b1f3f1de9ec8eeca2aaa	You will need a prescription from your doctor to do this.

zXHNSohTaa	This is QUICK, EASY, and CHEAP. Use olive oil to take off your make up. It gets mascara out great. If you want to use it just on your eyes, put it on a cotton ball and swipe. You could also massage it all over your face. Afterwards, take your shower as usual. Olive is great for the skin, and I'm acne prone but it doesn't break me out. HTH!|`|LJxKNAdVaa	baby oil or lotion<br>  then wipe it with<br>  a tissue
xcvuJfKMaa	I had the same problem, but now my skin is flawless.  If you can afford to, find a really good dermatologist and get your skin peeled professionally.  From there your Derma., will give you a skin regimen and what products work best for your skin.  So the highest expense will be the peel, and you may only have to do it once or twice a year.

If it isn't for very long then you should be fine skipping the sea salt soaks for a few days until your back home. Just make sure you continue to keep the piercing clean with the anti bacterial soap. Then once your back home immediately start your sea salt soaks again.|`|FIOOKpz0aa	Just use the antibacterial soap until you go home, its what was recommended to me if I didn't want to buy provon

It will top it up and make it shine.|`|rjScLN05aa	i certainly don't see why not! Just notice the tint of the color that the jergens might give you.

Like say 1 day u didn't want to tan well use that.|`|au1yFfuxaa	No, I have worked at 3 different tanning beds and I stand by this - either use a tanning bed (maximum three times a week in my opinion) OR use jergens natural glow. If you use both your going to end up orange as hell. Sunless tanner is best to use over night (put it on right before you go to bed) mainly before special occasions so you can have that "just got back from the bahamas" look.|`|NQOoeoWwaa	Yes you can. I tan indoors, but also use Jergens because I love the smell and it is moisturizing.. plus it kind of gives  you a nice "shine" to your skin...<br>  <br>  Jergens does not have a lot of DHA to give that drastic orange colour.. and with tanning, you will probably not even notice the difference.|`|jFCA0Pwcaa	i wouldnt do either- jergens natural glow- i've used it and after TWO days, my face was a HORRIBLE orange. i had to wash my wash my face 5 times a day for 3 days for it to come off. it looks terrible. just wait a few weeks for the sun to come out and get it naturally :D|`|CrT9sfEtaa	I have that stuff.<br>  <br>  No, definitely not.  You aren't supposed to tan with this stuff on because it can cause terrible skin damage and skin cancer in the future.<br>  <br>  It is made so that you don't need sun or tanning bed exposure in order to tan.|`|eO6GqpOqaa	I don't see anything wrong with doing that health wise, but you might get fined for using  indoor tanning lotion in the beds, every tanning salon I have gone to permits it, and may take away your membership. Use it after you tan|`|cOdXeyeFaa	noooooooooooo..you do one or the other...dont overdo it...i  suggest moisturize after you get the tan..not before it.........

xcvuJfKMaa	Call a dermatologist and they can suggest something for you.  The best thing is shots in the armpits, but if you must wear deodorant, then dove clinical strentgh, but still call a derma and they will tell you the best for you.|`|ERjGLJaEaa	Umm I use Dove, but I have seen commercials about the clinical strength deoderants. I know that Secret has one and ummmm Degree I think. Try those. They are supposed to be clinically tested for sweating. I would go to a dermatologist. You could have a hormonal imbalance or something and there are pills you can take that will stop that.|`|9iphkDSTaa	I use Dove Powder Fresh and it's good. My friend swears by Dove Clinical Strength, though, and she does a lot of soccer and exercise, so she's often sweaty. Maybe give that a try?|`|OvsgyxxDaa	any deodorant works fine.

ntJx4fmYaa	Don't put them in the wash, it will ruin the suede, fur, and the other textures. Usually, at the store you purchased your Uggs, they sell a special cleaner for just that material. I would suggest using that.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!! :)|`|QMYNU9uNaa	Don't put them in the washer, they will get ruined! Instead you should invest in the Ugg Care Kit! It has a cleaner for the outside and also has a spray for the inside that makes them smell nice and eliminated odor. It costs about $20-$25 dollars for the kit and is definitely worth the price.

J6Tdrd8Xaa	When you're getting used to high heels it's important to let the heel take the weight, you see people walking flat-footed because they think the heels will snap if they dare to put their weight down on them, they're designed to take your weight. As soon as you master the heel then toe walk you'll be absolutely fine. Try to walk so your feet go in front of each other with every step, no wide legged steps, that's what men always do when they walk in high heels!.

0nUkHUulaa	Waxing pulls hair out by the roots - often damaging the follicles. This means not so much hair grows back. The hair that does grow back has a rounded soft edge and is not at all abrasive scratchy. Frequent waxingwill eventually drastically reduce the number of hairs that grow  back - and this is a good thing.<br>  <br>  Shaving on the other hand only affects the surface hair leacing atleast a thinrd of the hair under your skin - and the follicles intact. It doe snothing to affect the hair's ability to grow back - and some schools of thought would have you beleive it actually encourages stronger hair growth. Shaving cuts a sharo edge to the end of the hair, which grows out WITHIN A DAY to a very irritating scratch unsightly leg-look.<br>  <br>  WAX - FTW|`|tfjukQP8aa	Epilate :)<br>  it gets every hair, even small ones. i use it when the hairs are just coming out. <br>  for most people it would hurt to use it, but since you've been waxing for a long time, it shouldnt hurt too much, if at all.  Plus, an epilator saves you money and time in the long run.  I use Braun Silk-Epil 5270.|`|XBohAsxoaa	just shave.

EBI1B6Baaa	I have the same problem. <br>  <br>  Here's what works for me:<br>  Get an extra hold Mousse. Put it through your hair BEFORE curling<br>  then curl. Spritz with a good quality spray when you're done. I like Big Sexy hair also, but it tends to get crunchy so I like to use others. Joico makes a great finishing spray. I used a friend's Finese Xtra hold once, and it worked also... so I really think it's the mousse that keeps it going. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps ya!!|`|Deb4iqbvaa	This is time consuming, but worth it:<br>  <br>  1. Wash hair, then apply a gel that supports curls while hair is damp.<br>  2. Wrap a strand of hair around your finger and wind towards head.<br>  3. Pull finger out of hair, stick a bobby pin in the hair to hold it.<br>  4. Repeat on entire head.<br>  5. Let hair air dry, or blow dry it (be careful, the bobby pins can get hot)<br>  6. Once hair is completely dry, get in the shower.<br>  7. DO NOT GET HAIR WET!!! You are using shower's steam to SET your hair.<br>  8. Spray hair with a super hold hair spray. Let hair spray dry.<br>  9. Pull out bobby pins, fluff hair with fingers.|`|EozmdXakaa	put a curling spray in your hair. or mousse.

First off, it is going to work much better if you have a few layers in your hair.<br>  <br>  Method one: Start with clean damp hair. Apply moose and if frizzy hair, defrizzer. Then, take a large round brush (the kind with the bristles and the metal with holes in it allow the heat to pass through the brush while you are blow drying) and blow dry your hair while twirling the brush in a circular motion in the direction of the way you want the hair to curl/wave. <br>  Sometimes it helps to roll your hair up in the brush and heat the brush and let it cool. Be careful in doing this! It can knot your hair and lead to breakage. I suggest this only if you have experience.<br>  <br>  The second method would be to use a curling iron. Use a 1 to 2 inch curling iron and roll your hair in the direction you want the curl (away from the face or towards, in this video's case away from the face) in LOOSE curls. By the second day, you defiantly will be able to achieve this look. Spray with hair spray.<br>  <br>  Remember, with any kind of curl and or wave style you will need to use styling products. When used correctly you can make a style last 2 to 3 days still looking clean.|`|BHEr4k6haa	if you are wanting your hair always to look like that, go for a wavy perm<br>  <br>  if you just want to style it like that, try towel drying your hair, adding a mousse that adds curl, and then using a diffuser to dry the rest<br>  <br>  p.s. diffuser= comb-like addition to blow dryer, use in a circular motion for the look your going for|`|fFOzNY6jaa	I'm not sure, but it looks as if her hair is naturally like that :P im not sure probably know how true that assessment is, but i dont know how you may replicate it. good luck ;P|`|4BLGtt4Caa	thats cute.. well try using a big curler or go and have a professional wash and style and see how they do it.. its like$20|`|Afd77Xekaa	Ok well first of all her hair is chopped up in lots of layers, they arent really curls they just curled the ends of her layers.

Just keep it as it is, and maybe just trim it a tiny bit.|`|KId2K1G4aa	i'd say get your bangs cut again. and if u do want to go for the layers don't get too many. cause it will make your hair look shorter in a pony tail and sometimes be even harder to style. i have probably about the same length hair and i wish mine was all the same length. but if u want something different only do a couple layers. not up to your shoulders or anything. try to find the happy medium otherwise it could like like your hair dresser doesn't really know how to cut hair. but def go with the bangs again.. if they're side bangs do the right at your eye brow...|`|4752ed18091b7f30115bd3f05992d180aa	I suggest layers :)<br>  But not real choppy,unless you want to straighten it most of the time.<br>  Hair vitamins should help your hair grow longer,faster :)<br>  But if you liked the bangs when you had them,i say go for it.<br>  Don't look like everybody else!<br>  Stand out!|`|pumHqbjiaa	Yes get bangs cut again.

You can get get these items at hot topic target or maybe your nearest Walgreen .if your not preppy or emo u can try the not geeky but smart girl look.

jez0O0bXaa	To get blonde you have to bleach it. That will permanently remove the color pigment in your hair.  The only way to fix it is to fill your hair with the missing pigment (gold) then dye it your brown. I would get a wig.|`|H9DY3ElFaa	well to get your hair i lighter color light blonde you might have to bleach it. Therefore, the only way to get your other color back is to wait for it to grown or dye it a color similar to yours now.|`|0f4758fa1f09e7e448e520883c78b9c4aa	There is no way to temporarily go lighter -- when you go lighter, it's permanent until it grows out, you cut it off, or dye over it.<br>  <br>  The temp. colors only work for going darker.

The all black ones are very comfy and nice, but if i were you I'd get the 1st one. Matches more clothes, then later on if you want get the second one.

As for the fitting, they feel COMFY AS HECK. HOWEVER they do rip up easily after a year or 2. Sometimes the shoe laces are evil and you have to tie them almost everytime you take off your shoes or put it on :[.

VfsC8jM9aa	Do NOT use boxed products from places like Wal-Mart. You will do yourself a favor for spending the extra dollar on professional products. <br>  <br>  You don't have to have a brush and dish to dye your hair. It is easier and works just as well to use a plastic bottle (at least a four ounce applicator bottle 2 bucks at Sally's).<br>  <br>  The hair dye will tell you how much developer and what volume to use depending. <br>  When mixing professional colors, you ALWAYS mix equal parts.<br>  For example: Most hair dye bottles come with 2 oz of color and then you mix 2 oz of developer to make 4 oz.<br>  <br>  As for what volume to use. When you are just depositing (darkening or not going any lighter) a color onto the hair, you will want a lower volume number, usually a 20 volume. If you are lifting color (making it lighter) then you will go with a high volume developer such as a 30 to 40 depending on the lift you want.|`|Deb4iqbvaa	I get a plastic bottle for mixing the stuff; usually a bottle of hair color and a half bottle of developer does the trick. <br>  <br>  I also have a pair of Sally's black gloves so my hands don't get dirty. The gloves stay on and are reusable. <br>  <br>  From home, I wear an old t-shirt because it's inevitable that you'll drop some. I also lay an old towel over the bathroom sink & floor (hair dye on porcelin is forever).<br>  <br>  And finally, I put a thin layer of vaseline around my hairline so I don't dye my face!|`|xHCezKLuaa	i think you have everything down, coloring hair is very easy, ive been dying my hair myself for years.<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|AA11950233	those are professional products, they work just fine.<br>  <br>  The cremes are labeled, the liquids aren't. The clerk will tell you how much developer to use from a chart. Get a plastic squeeze bottle with measurements on the side.|`|jez0O0bXaa	What is a NON professional hairdresser?  You are or you aren't.  Any way, Yes go to Sally's the have more pro products & can assist you with any questions if you don't mind that some of them are professional hairdressers.  We professionals do realize not everyone can or wants to go to a salon & have their hair done & Sally's is the next best thing and not to use "box color".

aEfHSWLYaa	idk, maybe some not all. I think most though it reflects who we are. im a guy with long hair, i guess its because we define ourselves n go against the usual "trends" or norms. n we get alot of negative press, most girls like guys with short hair who spike it or gel it alot. or wen a guy dresses baggy "gangster". personally not my style. but us long hairs r more open n yes i'd say mature|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	damn!|`|XJrsfzCLaa	WHOA thats too long<br>  but ya, no<br>  I dont find them mature<br>  OR picky with girls|`|pLAP7u7laa	long hair? yuck, no thanks.|`|5fXVSILjaa	dude the reason they never hit on girls and grow their hair long is because secretly their gay.|`|QO899Wh1aa	ummm, maybe it's because they're GAY???|`|24Xy8qWtaa	LOL oh yes he looks quite prudish alright.<br>  I think you're shallow if all you're thinking about is hair.|`|k7xC3jleaa	there no more mature then the ones with short hair, nor are they any pickyer, most guys with long hair just think that there better then everyone so they try not to really care about anyone else

zMRuRLhQaa	Ive been through many mascaras and my favorite right now is the new Maybelline Lash Stiletto Ulimate Length Mascara.<br>  <br>  Tip #1: How to apply mascara. Ace your mascara application with a three-step process: <br>  Step 1: Wiggle the wand left to right at the base of lashes. It's the mascara placed near the roots -- not the tips -- that gives the illusion of length. <br>  Step 2: Pull the wand up and through lashes, wiggling as you go. <br>  Step 3: In this final step, close the eye and place the mascara wand on top of lashes at the base and pull through to remove any clumps. <br>  <br>  <br>  After I apply the mascara i look to see that my lashes are even and long.<br>  <br>  Beautiful flirty result<3<br>  Hope this helped!|`|EozmdXakaa	False lashes definitely make your lashes long, full, and dramatic. <br>  <br>  Curl your lashes then use a waterproof mascara. It has a thicker formula with more wax which holds the curl WAY better. (I recommend Covergirl Lashblast. it's amazing. it lengthens and thickens)  <br>  <br>  If you want, you can buy a eyelash growth formula. They can be a bit pricey though. <br>  <br>  Although thick and long lashes are awesome, avoid clumps cause it just looks messy and not pretty.|`|F3ZF914baa	their is this mascara white on one end and black on the other, the white side makes your eyelashes longer looking and the blackside makes them loook rly dark, i have the same problem my eyelashes r painfully short but this mascara helps bunches|`|M961DkIjaa	When you apply, put one coat on first and let it dry for about 3 minutes.  Go back and apply another coat and brush not just the front of the lashes but the backs.  You'll have longer lashes instantly.|`|iRRNMbQKaa	Lash extends is AMAZING. It really works. You have to build up the length, and it takes a while. But it is soooo worth it =] And if all else fails, fake it ;] (fake eyelashes I mean)|`|n3rEQ434aa	ive heard to use a regular eyelash curler and a heated curler too.  use diorshow blackout mascara..kind of expensive but worth it (so ive heard)|`|6731485851a7144b789aa54b46973facaa	I love Covergirl Lash Blast. But for length you probably want to go with a mascara that has the lengthening and actual mascara to it. <br>  As far as getting a curl: put a hair drier to your eyelash curler for a couple seconds then curl your lashes. Just make sure its not too hot first, I test on the inside of my wrist.<br>  Worse case scenario, get fake lashes.|`|uWmCQN1Iaa	you could buy the fake eyelashes<br>  <br>  i find that maybelinne Great lash mascara in blackest black works the best. you just keep layering it on after curling your lashes<br>  its in a pink container with a green top.<br>  i swear by it!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-Great-Mascara-Blackest-Black/dp/B00008Y1BE" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Maybelline-Great-M...</a>|`|dI9BLGYpaa	Estee Lauder Lash XL will make them that long (if you do get it, you need to open it and give it a few days to get the right consistency. It's always weird the 1st use.), but you also need a volumizing formula underneath such as Sephora Lash Plumper|`|Rx8U8eVnaa	Try a maybelline two step mascara.  The first step curls your lashes and the second one colors them.  That's what it looked like she used.  It works great and look really good.|`|AX13vUJeaa	Fake eyelashes and apply mascara (:|`|VwxAFT43aa	eye lash curlor!|`|HCTsrKAPaa	Curling my eyelashes makes them look shorter. You need to get right in at the lid to get these kind of lashes, brush it slightly side to side in at the lid and then drag the brush out. So close to the lid that you could possibly be putting mascara on the lid. To achieve that kind of lash, Do one coat, let it dry and then apply more. Keep doing that until you have the desired effect. Personally I think that look is a bit too much unless you're going out. Essence multi action mascara is actually the best mascara esp for that look. And it's dirt cheap. If you can't find it the next best thing is Blackout by Dior.|`|lxJoXNZwaa	Buy some sour patch kids - yummy. <br>  <br>  Oh you are talking about the eyelashes - <br>  If you don't really have that long of lashes try some colored mascara - that will draw attention to your lashes and eyes.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.melissacwalker.com/blog/pic_vibrant.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.melissacwalker.com/blog/pic_v...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://beauty.ivillage.com/makeup/makeuptrends/0,,79nc7ht6,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://beauty.ivillage.com/makeup/makeup...</a>|`|Afd77Xekaa	The bottom one is wearing fake eyelashes, the other girl has long eyelashes.<br>  <br>  Try fake eyelashes I do .. and i LOVE them.

XUYayi27aa	I have my tongue pierced so I'll try my best to help.<br>  <br>  When you first get the piercing, make sure you suck on ice on the way there (or they'll let you know depends on the shop). The swelling will start to happen after the piercing (duh) and your whole mouth will be tongue for a day, maybe more depends. Then the swelling will start to go down, you will have the talking problem for a week, but it's nothing big people will still understand you.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|24sK6L2uaa	Mine was swollen about a week. I am not sure how swollen though i was eating and everything fine right after.
T58Ood6yaa	dude theres tons of places you can go...like at the mall go to ....pac sun, zumiez, etc. zumiez usually has cool stuff...it really depends on what your into tho..like with converse? ..yeah go to zumiez, pac sun, etc. they usually have some ballin clothes|`|bWRetyRzaa	hey there!!  a few good websites for your age guys to go to are...<br>  www.tillys.com<br>  www.pacsun.com<br>  www.americaneagle.com<br>  <br>  hope i helped! ;)|`|fMFHzByxaa	if i were you, i would wear skinny jeans, flannel shirts, beanies, and old school vans. but the truth is, that most guys are really far behind in the fashion world. especially if they think that pacsun is cool.
KWENGfsjaa	i used it for my arms...my entire body just about lol. it worked...but i only used that for a while...cause it worked for a bit then didn't work anymore. junkkk.|`|vQXYqNkgaa	I have what you have, I believe. I asked a dermatologist about it, and she said that unfortunately, it's genetic and not really possible to cure. It is, however, easy to greatly reduce the number of bumps.<br>  <br>  I started by shaving my arms. This helped a lot-but be prepared for difficult upkeep. Definitely high maintenance.<br>  <br>  Also try AmLactin. It's a lotion you can get in any drug store. My dermatologist told me to apply it before I go to bed each night, and don't rub up and down to rub it in-only run your hand in direction of hair growth, from shoulder to elbow. This has helped tremendously too.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Remember that nobody else will find it to be that big of a deal-we're our toughest critics.|`|teNUDFtGaa	idk...try Neutrogena bodywash|`|Ivgd8sSCaa	You don't have arm acne. Arms don't produce the oil that the face,chest, and backs do. You probably have eczema or anothe skin condition. YOu just need to moisturize a lot. Acne products will dry it out and make up worse!|`|FzJBXFW5aa	it might it wont hurt if u try it
XUYayi27aa	What works for me is, washing my face with a nice facial cleaner (clean and clean works fine), then putting a dap of neosporin on it. <br>  <br>  Toothpaste will just make it more red & smell minty. and proactive spot treatment works yet slowly.
JcJSLAF6aa	It's not over till the princess sings.<br>  or it's not over till the mama sings..or something like that<br>  <br>  or all eyes on britney, **** (like circus/gimmie more lol)<br>  <br>  'cuz wasn't britney considered the princess of pop when she was younger?|`|HR4vMwcDaa	on the front "on her radar" or  "boy it's chaotic" then write britney spears and the date you go to the concert on either of those phrases write "i'm britney's b*tch" on the back. hahaha. that would be so cute!|`|01kEv36Faa	I AM BRITNEY SPEARS|`|7febd1924ed15c4568a394f303b9f586aa	you could put your favorite lyric from one of her songs and make it funny..like the 'im seeking for amy' comment lol|`|6urbYPyKaa	i seek amy hahah jk
tObHGRGDaa	toothpaste?<br>  Never heard of that one lol.<br>  But heres what i do and its a life saver.<br>  Go to your local drug store, and head for the baby and diaper cream dptmt. not even kidding.<br>  pick up a tub of zinc.<br>  Its used to heal babies rashes<br>  but it also clears up blemishes haha or so i've found.<br>  if its a popped pimple dab the zinc around it. you dont want it to go in an open zit and clog it. if its not popped just dab a healthy amount on your pimple and sleep with it. just put it on your problem areas and when you wake up your skin will be noticiably clearer, i swear!!<br>  good luck!|`|sdP0E7uAaa	this probably isnt the best thing to do, but when one comes back to haunt me, i pop it, clean it with rubbing alcohol, take a band-aid, put a drop or two on the gauze of the band-aid and cover the popped pimple for the night. i even sometimes do that with a stubborn pimple that isnt ready yet. its not the best thing, but it helps. be careful though. rubbing alcohol does kill the first layer of skin.|`|Deb4iqbvaa	Best pimple advice I ever got was from a 52 year old man! He said he used to put Neosporin on it! It makes sense to me because it keeps the area clean and protected and free of bacteria.<br>  <br>  In the meantime I'd use alcohol swabs on things your chin touches, like your cell and things like that.|`|9BW2ics3aa	sometimes pimples happen when you sweat a lot or when u get stressed out...try to stress less if thats the problem...if its not then make sure u REALLY clean your face if you sweat this should help hope the pimple don't come back to haunt you anymore!!!! ^_^|`|OZaIVkibaa	<a href="http://acnegonefast.notlong.com" rel="nofollow">http://acnegonefast.notlong.com</a> - this is all you should need|`|d1m4Gsf6aa	don't pop it, it will make it worse. i use proactiv twice a day and that stuff really works.

I have red hair too. You know you look like a 15 or 16 year old girl. You look youthful like you should! I would say there is a big difference between appearing mature and actually being mature. Guys like a more natural looking woman than you would think. I would stay away from too much make up. You want to be you and not aim to be someone else and paint your face to get this fake look every girl seems to be striving for. Don't always look to mass media to shape you. Have a good one, hope your teeth look good.|`|au1yFfuxaa	You can't make yourself magically look older, you are 15, and thats how you are going to look.

But time flies and soon enough you will be all grown up!|`|E4TQE4RVaa	I'm your age, and look younger than I really am too :/  The only way I could think of would be a certain kind of way to do make up, but I wouldn't really know anything much in that department.

Keep your hair how it is and just put some color on your lips and some eyeshadow. Don't go for something too bright and don't put a lot on.

Once those come off you will look a lot older. Maybe try cutting your hair a a little shorter. A cute shoulder length haircut with layers.

JySB8dOZaa	Hi, I don't think you want to hear this but flat ironing your hair everyday can ruin it.  Have you tried working with the natural curl? I wish i had curly hair LOL, but everyone wants something different.  Any way what about colour extensions, I can't see you, maybe try pinks or reds, and putting in some random little plaits or canerow, like round your face. I wish I could wear my hair like that. Also I suggest growing your hair, and maybe it getting it slightly layered at the front, if your mom lets, of course, so if it's in some plaits/canerow at the front it will appear alot shorter and more face-framing, if you see what i mean
gU3yIZwMaa	agreed.<br>  if i played golf, i wouldn`t wear gap.<br>  i have my dignity to think about.<br>  <br>  i did find ONE dark khaki military shirt which was cool for $12, that`s all i bought in that store for that last, i don`t know how long. i think it was old stock, really old stock -- as in the font on the price tag was different from that on the other store items.|`|a7c40583290789c6ea0453de5e51b445aa	Gap's quality is slowly declining... the ONLY thing i ever buy there anymore is tank tops, but I'm not going to anymore because Old Navy has more colors and is a hell lot cheaper!

So this is no surprise to me.|`|tdgIFDaTaa	Yes, their spring line is nothing special.|`|uLelMuqZaa	I know. When I was younger and went shopping with my mom, I would look at womens' clothes thinking, "When I'm older, I would definitely wear something like this!" Now I'm just barely big enough to fit into them, and I'm like, "Ew. Jeez, what happened?"<br>  <br>  So you're not the only one.|`|AA11434640	I agree. I usually find lots of pieces there but not lately. It's very disappointing and the colors...Ehh.

JySB8dOZaa	Personally, i don't think that's somehow masculine, just my preference. Also when you shave hair, it grows back thicker and looks darker, so have to keep shaving, and really do want stubble on your arms? If not TMI I like body hair on men!<br>  <br>  Dietrich- women can speak for themselves, and honestly it's weird if a guy has less body hair than we do. Not many women shave their arms. Tho I agree with you it's important to be comfortable with yourself.|`|nHV3sKJ3aa	Well if they are so hairy that you can't even see your arms then do it.<br>  Otherwise, it isn't necessary.|`|tObHGRGDaa	no my boyfriend got his arms waxed to keep his tatto clean, im deffinitly not a fan of the hair i think its a great idea, but i dont suggest shaving. seriously waxing isnt that bad, i know two guys who wax.  they get it done professionally and some people just think their gods...but truthfully theyre just not embarresed to get their arms done!!<br>  guys do it!!<br>  if you shave it you'll have the hairy beast problem amplified.<br>  :|<br>  good luck!|`|TYRRjIv4aa	Men are susposed to be hairy! Don't worry about it and be happy that you have your health.|`|4TqadRJYaa	thats gay dude<br>  not even girls do that|`|VEoGKrJxaa	No don't bother.  It'll only make it worse.|`|SIRmkzEBaa	I think you should leave it.   =)<br>  Your a guy..it's alright!<br>  <br>  But if it's really getting to the point were you, yourself can't handle it anymore, I suggest you invest in 'laser hair removal' don't go to shaving, your hair growth might double, if you do shave! and it seems to me that you wouldn't like that..<br>  <br>  Me, personally..I don't mind if a guy is 'hairy' or not.. it just doesn't matter to me.|`|JIflnfU1aa	Go ahead, I done it before and it will show your muscles off more. These women say yea its alright but really, they like the smooth look. But all that matters is that you're confident and comfortable with who you are tho.|`|n41yoBzFaa	Haha I would just leave them the way they are. There is nothing wrong with hair on your arms. Most girls actually find hair on men pretty attractive. Not all of us like guys to clean themselves up too much. It makes us think you are less masculine.|`|5oxoLx5naa	Yeah, probably.

nUqGDTvxaa	buy a chain made of real gold or silver.|`|zlXofrG4aa	Try spraying it down with a clear gloss spray that you can find in the crafts section/paint section of a store.  It's an acrylic sealant so hopefully that'll protect your neck.|`|R0ybk8vcaa	You should take your necklace to a jewelry shop and ask for his/her advice on what the best cleaner is.  Then I would have the jeweler adjust it so that wont break and its fits around your neck perfectly. Or it may be that the other chain you useed to fix it isnt real. Then you may need to buy a new chain.|`|NsePqNIEaa	Its probably not that the chain is dirty, it's just a reaction between the metal and your skin.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jewelry.about.com/od/jewelrymetals/a/skin_reactions.htm" rel="nofollow">http://jewelry.about.com/od/jewelrymetal...</a><br>  You could coat the chain with nail polish, thats what that link says, rofl.<br>  Sounds weird though...<br>  I dunno, I'd just say get a different chain. :S
cJkcSEzRaa	you are a pretty girl, no doubt. but take it from me, you're fourteen, and it'll be a few years before your whole body matures. what i mean is that it'll be another few years before your face matures more, and your whole body in general. in a few more years, you won't be even asking yourself if you're cute, you'll be saying, "damn, i'm hot!!!" so for now, you are a pretty girl, yes. soon, you'll be smoking hot and fighting off those suitors like crazy lol.<br>  <br>  as for make-up, black mascara and eyeliner are always great picks, but because you have those lovely blue eyes and that fair skin, all purples, blues, pinks, browns, grays, even brown mascara would really bring those eyes out. even golds would make you look outstanding! but remember, less is more, and because of your age, you should always apply eyeshadow with a light hand. as for lips, regular clear lipgloss would look great, especially the nivea (<a href="http://www.nivea.com/products/show/229)" rel="nofollow">http://www.nivea.com/products/show/229)</a> and the blistex (<a href="http://www.blistex.com/Lip_Products.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://www.blistex.com/Lip_Products.htm)</a> lip care lines; they are super awesome for lips, they really make your natural lip color come out!<br>  <br>  and remember: sometimes, less is more. it's always better to not have enough than to have too much. =] Hope this helps pretty girl!!!|`|8NkHu7Owaa	boring...your teeth are yellow. your hair is stringy and you seem like you try way too hard. the amount of make up you wear is fine if not too harsh, try going with brown mascara or eyeliner to soften up your face. sorry but you're not really that pretty. thats my honest opinion.|`|iWmU3fSWaa	you look like your average everyday teenager :]<br>  thats not a bad thing either!!<br>  i recommend some teeth whitner... :]|`|rnUr1JJ7aa	Aww you look cute!! very Pretty|`|Cu0fPcdnaa	you look gorgeous and you look like a nice person inside and out side.|`|tgVDf0Qmaa	u look really nice but the snake freaked me out. u look like 16. im 14 and i could pass for like 10 without makeup. haha. try making your hair a bit fuller. ive learned to sleep on my face because i have to sleep in velcro rollers because if i dont my hair falls flat. u dont have to do that though. sometimes im lazy or if i dont have time just use that root stuff. that gives u volume too.<br>  <br>  overall id say ur average to above average.
zhzJoZ26aa	Definitely not! Firstly, it's two different hair textures, and secondly because your hair is so thick you will need a lot of layers, either way it will stuff look bad. I wear extensions right now to thicken my hair, I have very fine, thin, straight hair. That works for me. I  buy mine at a little shop about 20 minutes from my house. But I've heard lots of good thing about beautychoice.com I've bought stuff from there before, but never extensions so I can't tell you if they're any good. Personally I'd just go into a shop there is real hair in different textures the man or woman working there can match you're color and texture perfectly.<br>  <br>  By the way for the price everyone is shocked when I tell them how little I spend. I've bought extensions (real human hair) from 30$ to 85$. My 14" we're 30 and my 24" (which is what I use now for my hair to make it more thick, because my hair is too long for them now and it's the longest my salon carries) I also have 18" 45$ 20" 60$ 22"70$|`|5dDkydiZaa	in the malls they have extensions uhh i bought a natural hair one for 175 in the mall its clip on and you can curl it or straighten and has a lifetime warranty :)

n41yoBzFaa	I would just use A LOT of hairspray and there is also curling sprays and gels that you can put in your hair at night that help your hair to curl easier. I used Garnier  Fructis Curl Sculpting Cream-Gel and Garnier leave-in conditioning cream Sleek & Shine at night and then when Im curling my hair, I use Aussie Sprunch strong hold. It works for me so i hope it will work for you :)|`|NutVkFrIaa	Try a small barrel curling iron|`|7ePWAxYSaa	yeah, tough luck....some peoples just will not curl.<br>  but you could always try spraying some curl defining spray and scrunch gel into your hair and then scrunching it if your hair already has some natural curl to your hair.<br>  otherwise, you might want to stick with a flat iron and some sleek and shine stuff

gEkLQWF4aa	your hair falls out at a large rate...I lose a lot of hair in the shower as well, but it's because I have thick hair. Do you have thin hair? If so, try and use volumizing shampoos. hair falls out naturally. It's just something that happens. I wouldn't worry about it unless it's showing on your scalp that your hair is thinning. Also, straightening your hair a lot will cause stress on your hair that will make it fall out more. Try and only straighten it for special occasions, and on other days use conditioning products that will make your hair look good in it's natural state. I also use a vitamin called Biotin that I got from a vitamin shop. They recommended it for strengthening your hair, and it also helps it grow faster. It's good for your nails, as well.|`|wzue5Xzbaa	Not getting enough protein? I heard that eating a spoonful of peanut butter daily is good for strengthening your hair; makes it grow, etc.|`|MiKrWuM6aa	Straightening your hair a lot and using protecting products is actually bad for your hair.  Stop doing that for about a month and you will see a difference.|`|WIsxqR7caa	Too much product = fried hair/scalp. Ease up on the ironing and protecting products..|`|D9ZT6kzXaa	It could be from too tight of pony tails or more likely stress.|`|qnBIXPx5aa	YOU WASH UR HAIR WAY TO MUCH U NEED THOSE NATURAL OILS FOR UR HAIR TO STOP FAILLING OUT|`|3dMoSQT2aa	Dont straghten your hair a lot. The rest of the stuff you do is fine, dont straighten your hair becasue this will make your hair fall out. Also dont wear too many hats, because this too makes hair fall out. You also should know that there is a time period where hair just falls out because its mostly dead hair cells and new ones are producing. I had this happen to me. Lasted for about three months or so. Everytime I shower, my hair would just fall and fall to a point where i got scared taking showers. lol. Then my hair stylist said that this happens because your getting new hair and hormones. So have patience my dear, everything will be all right.|`|wrQAapJqaa	Hey there<br>  I have had this problem before and the main thing that made me loose them was...stress, it happened to my mom the same way, the worst part of it all is that they do not show back up so once you loose them that is it! sorry. <br>  Also using hair dryers and such makes them weaker and they fade out.|`|iG3sM3I3aa	Maybe you are just accidentally pulling out some hair in the shower.<br>  <br>  Or, I have heard about this disease that makes you lose hair, not cancer though. But don't worry about it that much.<br>  <br>  Try to wash you hair more gently. If it continues to fall out, consult your doctor.|`|EveGFir5aa	well i've known someone with the same problem<br>  and it was the straightening or styling<br>  but the hair products<br>  <br>  once she switched off of her shampoo and conditioner, her hair stopped falling out|`|JvxwNufDaa	Aww, I do too, sweetie!! I told my mom about it and everybody says it could be because I dont get enough iron, or vitamins. You should take vitamins!|`|R8v712Gvaa	It is normal!  Every person looses about 50-100 strands of hair a day.<br>  I loose a LOT of hair in the shower too. I think its cause of my straightner|`|QkIJEG1Gaa	you have a thyroid problem, which is responsible for metabolism actions, better see your doctor.|`|wNY3P6jEaa	it may b the stress of someone near u. so if something os going on with u let it along 4 a while & c wat happens|`|JxVuTUjUaa	People lose 100 hair a day, if your hair is long, it will look like it's a lot of hair when it's not that much|`|GfJq7d6waa	don't straighten your hair as much, and then you will use less products (which are really bad for hair)
jdZfzZUjaa	It would actually make you look thin. But are you talking about a 1-piece or a 2-piece?
jSkr6r1iaa	take Airborne. its a vitamin I take to get over a cold.  makes my hair and fingernails grow like crazy!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Massage small amounts of fresh or canned coconut milk into the scalp and keep overnight if possible or at least for a few hours. This procedure will help hair grow longer,  thicker and also make your hair look soft and shiny. Try <a href="http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.c...</a>  for more remedies and details.|`|CEKZsoFRaa	vitamins|`|4KRSUhXLaa	Well if you can get your parents to drive you to the store or maybe they can just pick some up for you.....there is a hair shampoo and conditioner (also other products to go along as well) called NIOXIN. It makes your hair grow a lot faster than just going it alone. The only reason I know is my best friend used to dye her hair every other week and her hair ended up falling out and breaking off so bad she was almost bald.....Scary! Anywho she used that shampoo and conditioner for about a month and her hair was growing back so fast. She now has better hair than she did to begin with. So that is just an idea. You can buy it at alot of hair supply stores....Utla, Sally Beauty Supply, Etc.|`|3Y7RJu3taa	Its really in your genes, but it helps to have a healthy diet.  I've also heard that massaging your scalp can increase blood flow to the scalp and thus make hair grow faster.  It makes sense but I'm not sure how effective it is.<br>  If you are trying to grow your hair out, the most important thing is to keep it healthy: regularly condition your hair and try not to overuse heat styling products.|`|B2UuTy2Yaa	stay healthy. Also putting hair products such as gel in you're hair can slow it down by clogging the pores. So I would suggest always keeping it clean.|`|HQp1MGgvaa	multivitamins like Flintstones.<br>  <br>  I tried it and it works|`|QHBuH39jaa	Take vitamins daily and have your hair trimmed about every six weeks.  Both of these promote growth.  I know because I have been growing mine for "locks of love".  I have about another inch to grow but it has only taken me about a year to grow it nearly 9 inches.|`|tObHGRGDaa	try taking a biotin vitamin. <br>  & as a girl, i sleep with my hair in a pony tail and i swearr that makes a difference, not sure if your hair can do that...though. :)<br>  good luck!|`|2TaAScEiaa	a good shampoo..... one called mane and tail .... used alot to grow hair fast ( and read into it too don't just look at in be like wtf)|`|NmBjSCOyaa	dunk your head in a bucket of lemon juice. swear to god it works.|`|Vi9Mdz1vaa	Eat vitamins. It totally works:)|`|BnhOBmUeaa	trim your ends every 2 weeks honestly it works it let ur ends breathe and grow|`|D0wM1Qpeaa	use plenty of shampoo|`|Yds3Dn5Qaa	Yeah, they have shampoos to make your hair grow faster and stronger, like Garnier. You should also eat a lot of proteins like peanuts. You can also massage your scalp when you shampoo your hair, it opens up the roots and makes your hair grow faster. Lastly, keep your hair healthy! Try to cut away all the split ends that can stunt the growth of hair and try not to use a lot of chemicals or hot irons on it.|`|273vsUezaa	For the most part hair grows at it's own rate, and isn't influenced much.<br>  <br>  Sometimes when girls get pregnant their hair does grow a little faster. Also, if your diet is poor and you don't get any of the vitamins you need, and you start up with a great diet while taking multivitamins you may experience a very small difference.<br>  <br>  Not really anything that will give you a mop top in a month or anything though|`|YpyXydQAaa	Wash you hair everyday, using Shampoo&Conditioner(: <br>  <br>  Be sure to brush your hair also! and don't use much chemical products, it damages you hair.. <br>  <br>  And trimming your hair every couple months is good also, and it will GROW(:|`|eD0wrr4Oaa	trim it often, but never more than 1/4 inch, it will make it healthier. also, dont wash as often, natural oils help.  otherwise, dip your hair in lemon juce - that always works! ?|`|3p54tCFAaa	trim it every 6 to 8 months:) it stimulates it to grow faster:)|`|R8VhFeEVaa	they don't even have to be special, just multi-vitamins, and a healthy lifestyle including diet, good hydration, exercise and regular sleeping patterns.|`|QIvzmKZuaa	special vitamins!!
A44bCDswaa	Big noses unite! well mine isn't like huge or anything! Anyways what i suggest is that you always look people straight on it your nose is long and slender, and possibly always tilt your head slightly down and to the right. If your nose if wide then draw attention to your eyes with liquid eyeliner and big long mascara created eyelashes. for the most dramatic eyelashes you should apply mascara all the way around the lashes putting extra on the outside edges.|`|BqqDJXkjaa	The noes is slightly big, but not crooked so its perfect for photography (people with big noses photograph much better than others)

faf627e55a95a22d42d6bbdbbb2c5170aa	Come on, if you're really a model you'll know that almost all models shave large parts of their body.<br>  <br>  Time for you to start shaving.<br>  <br>  Yes, it's a moustache -- some girls develop a moustache, just like boys do.<br>  <br>  If you do decide you have to do something, then there isn't a simple answer and there's a lot of misleading "information" around.<br>  <br>  Facial (and also body) hair on women comes about in the same way as on men because of<br>  <br>  1) your body being sensitized, before you were even born, to testosterone -- doesn't happen to all girls, but does to many<br>  <br>  2) your body producing high levels of testosterone<br>  <br>  The growth rate and coarseness of the hair depends on just how much testosterone is circulating in your bloodstream.<br>  <br>  Steer clear of bleaching -- when someone sees you against the light you'll look as if you have a glowing moustache. Believe me, it shows up far, far worse.<br>  <br>  As far as removing it is concerned it's worth remembering that<br>  <br>  * Waxing, plucking, threading, epilating all pull the hair out by the roots and where the growth is hormonally-driven can actually stimulate a dormant follicle into producing more hair quicker. They also distort the root if done repeatedly, leading to hair growing at strange angles. And you've got to let the hair grow to quite a length before you can repeat the exercise. It can also damage the skin and discolor it. Long-term use of waxing also causes bad wrinkles.<br>  <br>  * Chemical depilatories strong enough to remove the hair are very likely to burn the skin, cause swelling and cause long-term discoloration of the skin.<br>  <br>  * Laser is also liable to cause burning and discoloration and in any case only works effectively on a dark hair/light skin combinantion.<br>  <br>  * Electrolysis is very liable to cause scarring and discoloration of the skin.<br>  <br>  Which, like it or not, leaves shaving which does not damage the skin and does not cause the hair to grow more or coarser or faster. Best done with a men's-style electric razor, the best of which, for girls and women, are probably those from the men's range of Philips/Norelco razors (Philishave outside the US). Most girls and women who try a men's Philips/Norelco wonder why nobody ever told them about it before.|`|Sv9SQqyoaa	get it waxed|`|taYFAwlzaa	You can wax it.|`|mQhYZk2eaa	bleach it or wax it|`|dat8eoYyaa	wax that stashe !|`|240196f7d6a1fc2f0753fb8357ab2c18aa	wax it|`|tObHGRGDaa	wax it. you can do this at home or fork 20 -40 $ and get it done at a salon. If you do it at home be sure to put zinc on it after and sleep with it.

xjazE0xmaa	I plugged the information you provided into two diamond search engines (Diamond Price Guru and Pricescope).  They collect data from over a dozen, probably closer to 20, different retailers.  <br>  <br>  Pricescope didn't have any close matches, but Diamond Price Guru had 10 diamonds that matched the basic stats.  Of those 10, 6 had no fluorescence, 3 didn't list info on fluorescence, and 1 had "strong."  The price of that diamond is $15,979.40.  The only difference between it and the one you listed is in the depth and table percentages.  <br>  <br>  The original question, how important is fluorescence, is a good one.  Fluorescence is used in at least three different tests:<br>  <br>  --Medium to strong blue fluorescence indicates a diamond is real.<br>  --During a strong exposure to ultraviolet light, a man-made (laboratory-grown) diamond may expose its original catalyst.<br>  --And all blue diamonds have a fluorescence; scientists say each is unique like a fingerprint.<br>  <br>  So, fluorescence can prove a few things, but if you already have the stats, I suspect the diamond has been graded by a reputable gemological laboratory (GIA, AGS, EGL, etc.).  So you already know it's real.  They may have even provided a map of the diamond's inclusions, which is also considered a sort of diamond fingerprint.  <br>  <br>  So, while it's nice to know, it's not necessary information.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.
tObHGRGDaa	you can get your hair permanently straightened. that way you dont have to burn it between ceramic plates all the time.<br>  Using any type of heat will get your hair to style to a different shape and heat in general is what damages your hair. I have sorta curly hair so I just straighten the pieces underneath to give it style and less poof. lol. um but you might want to look for an ionic straighener. they use like positive and negative ions or something to straghten your hair. go to a beauty store and ask about an ion straghtener. or google it :P<br>  hope that helped!! good luck!!<br>  p.s. i have the conair infiniti with ionic plates its great and reduces the damage|`|I7mBG3Dnaa	Blow dry it using a round brush|`|AA11618466	This sucks, but the truth is, you can't.<br>  <br>  Unless you pay a whole lot of money to get it proffesionally straightened, which then, it isn't always perfectly staright.<br>  <br>  Straighteners DO damage your hair, but not that bad. I use one almost everyday. And my hair is fine, with good conditioner & hair treatment/product that i use.<br>  <br>  Get a straightener with ceramic plates. It's better for your hair. (:|`|ftrGCdOGaa	If you blow dry your hair it MIGHT do the trick.<br>  Otherwise, there isn't really any other way besides getting your hair chemically straightened, this will keep it straight for a few months, but will halt the growing process for a little while - but don't worry, it will begin again in a few weeks. <br>  If you don't like these ideas, before you straighten your hair spray in some Tresemme heat protection spray.. You can get this almost anywhere (Walmart, superstore, public hairdressers etc.) and it keeps your hair silky and smooth, and damage free WHILE you straighten your hair. It comes in a black and red spray bottle that looks like this:<br>  <a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_LvZW2IdyYRA/SUf6RyKKWdI/AAAAAAAABZ8/5Upd1aZc3Js/s400/tresemme-spray.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_LvZW2IdyYRA/SU...</a><br>  <br>  =]|`|zTeYsZAVaa	Tresemme! (hair brand) They have shampoo/conditioner and a straightning gel. =) And all their stuff is for an awesome price! Just go to any beauty store. A lot of regular stores have it too, like Fred Meyer, WinCo, Wal*Mart. <br>  <br>   Oh and it helps a lot when your hair is wet and you comb through it slowly every couple of minutes. It's how I kept my hair relatively straight at summer camp. <br>  <br>  So you do that and use the straightning line and you're good to go!<br>  <br>  Good luck! =)|`|T0lxsQXcaa	I agree with Ellie <br>  <br>  Try CHI flat irons or products they make a big difference and Hot Oil Treatments help ALOT|`|mWjrUoYraa	I'll tell you how. The results are not great though, but it does make your hair appear less curly and a little more on the wavy side.<br>  <br>  Actually, I know two. Both have to be done overnight.<br>  <br>  Buy some large rollers. Spirtz a tiny bit of leave in spray conditioner (I think Pantene has one) and put some sort if anti-frizz product. Roll your hair tightly around the rolls, and sleep with it on, or for at least 6-8 hours. Unroll your hair out and add more anti-frizz and just a tiny bit of leave in conditoner to add some weight to your hair. the appearance should be slightly wavy to straight hair with lots of body.<br>  <br>  Second thing you could do is get your self a pack of large bobby pins. Make sure your hair is free on tangles. Use the leave in conditioner and the anti-frizz like the first suggestion. Separate your hair in four sections. With a fine tooth comb, comb your hair very tightly and against your scalp and wrap around your whole head like a bandage. Secure the piece with bobby pins. Do the same for the other pieces. Make sure they don't have any bumps and that the pieces are smoothed down. If you want, you can get a hair net to keep the pins in place..also works for idea #1. This is something you can sleep with comfortably. I got this idea from how long haired people prep their head if they are wearing a wig. In the morning, remove all the pins and comb your hair. You probably will need to massage your scalp. Do that in a circular motion. Put a styling creme that will weigh your hair down as well as your anti-frizz. The result should be straight with a slight cripped look. If some pieces look out of place, adding a few thin braids can be interesting.<br>  <br>  I gurantee no damage.<br>  <br>  I hoped this helped.|`|U18g98GWaa	when you blow dry your hair, go in sections and use your brush as you blow dry. its also best to use some heat therapy spray or leave in conditioner when and if you do flat iron it. if you iron your hair everyday, its best that you invest in a really good one like chi.|`|kuGs3JUwaa	You should chi strenthener the ceramic ones … it’s the best… you should always use things to protect your hair… try chi products with it to protect your hair… but regardless your hair will get damaged because of the heat… so don’t do it often|`|fFOzNY6jaa	try straigtening it while its wet, and it doesnt dry out as easily.. for meh anyway.

FcbRUYExaa	I am pretty sure the only thing they know is whether or not their product will appeal to women or men. With womens products, stereotypically, they will be more inclined to buying scents that are associated with the words 'pretty' & 'beautiful' like a flower or the aromas that make a lot of people melt. As for guys, stereotypically, masculine (can not say much more, because how many guys want to smell like roses on their first date.. iffy. and no guy wants to be iffy) But umm, between you and me? I will no doubt wear my 'Old Spice' when coming out of the gym.. but on a date.. my Armani Cologne and a touch of Secret Deodorant, one thing i will hand to those companies is labeling.

Before the age of modern medicine and chemical laboratories, healers and medicine men had natural products for hair growth and replacement.  Some of these are still used today with varying results. Strictly speaking, all hair loss products could be considered “natural,” as they are produced from elements found on Earth.  <br>  <br>  A “natural” remedy refers to any ingredient as it is found in nature and not altered or treated in any way before its use.  Some people claim success with these methods and products, so it is worthwhile to examine a few of the most popular.<br>  <br>  ESSENTIAL OILS:  These are concentrated oils from certain plants, such as lavender, soybean, and bay.  They are massaged into the scalp and are purported to assist with circulation and follicle stimulation.<br>  <br>  EXERCISE:  Any form of exercise increases and improves blood circulation to all parts of the body, including the scalp.  It is believed that increased blood supply to the cells in hair follicles will maintain their health and stimulate hair production.<br>  <br>  HERBAL COCKTAILS: (NOT FOR INGESTION):  A variety of herbs are recommended, to include Rosemary, Sage, Nettle and Burdock.  The advice is to boil them together, strain off the leaves, and wash the hair with the solution every day.<br>  <br>  JOJOBA OIL:  Widely used in Mexico for hundreds of years, it is massaged on the scalp, and many claim it is highly effective in stimulating new hair growth.<br>  <br>  LOWERING DHT: DHT is formed when an enzyme in a man’s body acts upon testosterone and is believed to be responsible for the “closing-up” of hair follicles.  Provillus shows a lot of prospect and may block DHT production and thus shows promise as an aide for male hair loss sufferers. <br>  <br>  Homeopathic physicians usually recommend that some of these treatments be used concurrently.  Some have had success, but, as in all cases, different bodies respond differently to any treatment.  Still, they are worth a try before more expensive methods are considered.<br>  <br>  For more information visit: <a href="http://1goodhealth.com/gothair/" rel="nofollow">http://1goodhealth.com/gothair/</a>|`|v239PAC8aa	I take the vitamin for Hair, Skin, & Nails.

iLQ87NSUaa	hands might lose tan faster because they come more in contact with things,and you wash them more, and therefore, your skin is replaced faster.<br>  <br>  If you use an exfoliater, it removes the dead skin, and some of your tan with it.

OXOHoISraa	oral benadryl is a good idea. My guess, allergic reaction to the ink.  If you have good insurance, go ahead and go to a dermatologist.  If not, I would honestly give it a few days and change whatever you are using to heal it to a sensitive skin unscented lotion. If it doesn't clear up or gets worse, then you need to go to a dermatologist.<br>  <br>  Also, call and find out the brand of ink and exact colors used just for future reference.|`|GdJz0CrGaa	I would definately go back to the tattoo parlor and have them look at it.<br>  <br>  If they think you're having a reaction, then I'd head over to the doctor.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't wait too long before getting it checked out.|`|XUYayi27aa	This is normal, espically for people who have sensitive skin. Just take two benadryls orally you should be fine within a couple of days. Make sure your using antibacterial soap when washing the tattoo also. Using a regular kind of soap can cause this. A new tattoo is like an open wound, you should have to be careful of what kind of bacteria can get into it.

What i do is cut up some avocado, drizzle a little olive oil on it and sprinkle a little salt and eat it with bread. its delicious and good for your hair!|`|EDpvAf6Zaa	Don't wash it too often, but when you do only use a tiny bit of shampoo. Put it on your scalp and massage it in for a few minutes, it gets the blood flowing to help your hair grow faster. when you go out in the sun, use some sort of leave in conditioner with hair sunscreen in it. Don't over brush it and never brush while it's wet! Use a wide tooth comb. The key is just to have strong, healthy hair. It'll grow faster and be prettier :)|`|bHlqwHtAaa	Try to massage your scalp. This circulate the blood and cause an increase of hair growth. It's all natural and simple. Make sure to massage the scalp before showering since hair tends to become oily afterwards.

Especially since you're on a boat; if you're using your hands to hold onto stuff, a dark color could chip and look unpolished (pardon the pun).<br>  <br>  Have a great time and good luck!
tObHGRGDaa	I do the same thing. but when i get acrylic fake nails their to hard to bite! and i stopped :) andd, they had a chance to grow underneath the fake nails.|`|TfEBIjxZaa	Dip your fingers in alcohol|`|d17d21c4104847c065c9faed1b10ecf6aa	i do the exact same thing! <br>  but usually nail polish makes me quit... kinda.<br>  lol, just tell yourself NO! and carry nail clippers with you so you can pull them out and clip them instead of biting them.|`|JkumHzjraa	Hi there. Hmm, I wouldn't know because I don't bite my nails but I say put nail polish remover on your fingers. Not on your fingernails because you said you wear nail polish and you wouldn't that to come off but try putting it like right under your nails, where the skin's at. That way when you try to bite your nails, you'll taste the nail polish remover and not want to do it. And eventually you'll automatically stop thinking that it'll taste icky.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.|`|pVaZty4Maa	put nail polish on them thats how i stopped bitting on mine bc i get disgusted when i think of nail polish in my mouth and it might stuck to my teeth, so i don't bite them anymore|`|s1Q9vnqmaa	get braces, then you cant!<br>  haha once there off your cured!|`|FKdiwbqsaa	well, there are special treatments for nail biting.. but if you don't not want to buy them, get something bitter or very spicy and put it on your nails.|`|5fXVSILjaa	self displine girl. put on some clear nail hardener which is gross and also toxic. =) not really but anyway. whenever you got o bite them you'll get a bad taste in your mouth. and eventually phycologically you wont do it anymore. happened to me.|`|TVNlv1BBaa	My mom use to buy this stuff from sally's beauty supply store or the mall for my sister because she would bit her nails like crazy.

IUpwBn2Taa	take them to a shoe repair shop|`|Bx7F9jscaa	It depends. If you have the high tops, they'll probably get ruined since there's suede on them. If you have the low tops, you probably could put them in the washer, but they might fall apart sooner. I'd just spot clean them with a wet rag if I were you.|`|4KRSUhXLaa	You've asked a very interesting question. I am a previous Vans owner and these shoes are hard to keep clean, Especially around the bottom of the shoes. I used to get an old cup mix 50/50 bleach/detergent and an old toothbrush to scrub the whites of the shoes in order to keep them clean. Once the shoes get dirty around the bottom, it's hard to get that dirt ring out. Be careful with the bleach so it doesn't get on the material part of the shoe. However, you can also try putting them in the washing machine (but that makes the "VANS" logo fades after a few washing or even the 1st wash) but it does keep the "Material" part of the shoe clean.<br>  Good Luck.|`|1mL4Lxtnaa	It's possible. It may not be great for them in the long run, but you can do it.|`|NCvX4I0baa	I don't think so, and I wouldn't risk it either.<br>  I just handwash them my self just for the sake of it and it works out fine.|`|kYEsNrfiaa	I washed mine.

Never wash suede shoes it will ruin them.  Wash on warm of cold and air dry.  Use spray and wash or another kind of stain remover but DONT use bleach...I made the mistake of washing my white vans and white converse in the same load with bleach and something about the fabric type makes it turn yellow when bleached|`|IjBUiNOdaa	brush it with a little bit of soap. use an old toothbrush. by soap i mean soap that you use for washing clothes. and oh lots and lots of water. when u dry dont put it out on the sun cuz itll get yellow-ish.|`|RAr8frPZaa	Yes Yes and No|`|dYzQuosBaa	YES!!! it will loseeee color BIG time!
NSKimt1Qaa	Your hair is gorgeous!  If you want to get bangs, I think you'd look good with long bangs like that, and I also think a small trim with some layers is better than changing your hair too much from the way you have it now.|`|JUXpVYC4aa	sure|`|pVaZty4Maa	i think u would look great in bangs like them, you got the hair for it so do it, i wish i had hair for that style but sadly my freaking hair is naturally straight and won't hold a curl if its life depended on it, so i know its not going to do that :)|`|pumHqbjiaa	I think that'd be great.

NSKimt1Qaa	Your hair really does look good shoulder length and longer.  I also think you look about 15 or 16 in all the pictures.  You're braver than I am.  When my hair was really long, like down to my waist, I could never bare to get that much cut off at once.  Since you look good with it both ways, just wear it the way you like.  If you like it longer, grow it out.  At least it won't be like you're growing it out from a bad haircut.  Your new cut is pretty and frames your face nicely.|`|0UOHex1Maa	I like short a lot :)<br>  But, if you're wanting to look older, I think longer hair on you makes you look older.<br>  BUT, short hair is so cute on you!|`|v8AYoQPeaa	short|`|kJZOh1Flaa	I like short :)<br>  <br>  long hair maybe 15<br>  <br>  short hair about 15 too, sorry if that's totally off i suck at telling peoples ages!|`|JUXpVYC4aa	longer = better  <br>   <br>  you look about 15 with long hair, and 13 or 14 with short hair|`|zPvxaOYoaa	short|`|HamIpQaGaa	I think I would like you with even shorter hair.

8OVEjPg1aa	I think it looks fine now. <br>  <br>  Maybe a shoulder length cut? I think layers would look nice. It looks like you have thick hair (like me). Asking to have it "thinned" gives it lots of layers. And it makes hair feel so much lighter [great for in the summer]. <br>  <br>  Getting highlights might give your hair more deminsion. That doesn't mean you have to go with blonde streaks. A slightly lighter/darker color will do nicely.|`|HucBXB7Taa	Possibly;<br>  dye your hair black or blonde (optional)<br>  and i guess get your hair layered. :)<br>  & straightened.

uuHDQr1paa	People just have different skin tones based on their heritage.  Your ancestors had a particular type of skin based upon where they were from.  Dark skin protected people exposed to a lot of direct sunlight and the lighter skinned people primarily lived in the northern areas like Scandinavia.  That's just something you can't control.  Anyway, you shouldn't be tanning for the sake of tanning.  Once you have a tan...your skin is already damaged and you have a greater chance of developing wrinkles and skin cancer later in life.  Limit your exposure to direct sunlight (15-20 minutes per day).|`|OpduZC3Eaa	Consider yourself lucky.|`|d9Pzx4eCaa	It has something to do with your pigment. You can try a tanning bed that is about $40 for one session, and it has sensors that you put on your body and it makes it impossible for you to burn, but you tan like a ***. So, try that.|`|m6AZtL3uaa	I am the same way - I never tan or burn.<br>  I think its something to do with having no melanin in our skin which is a pigment in our skin that makes us change colour.|`|Q1iHujpeaa	when you get tanned, you are absorbing radiation. i guess your skin might block almost all of the radiation or at least enough so you don't tan.|`|zd6xaGMnaa	Some people are born were they are naaturally white and when they tan they just get freckles|`|YbPlBVgyaa	You don't need to be tan to look good.  Actually sometimes it's better not to tan so you don't get those hideous tan lines.  And I've seen many attractive Asians who have pale skin.  Personally, I don't think skin tone really matters.

OfHoaWf7aa	I have nothing against them, it's just that I feel awkward around them since I'm pretty tall. I personally like to date someone who's taller than me; I feel more secure and protected.|`|JUXpVYC4aa	If they're hot and a really good guy I wish they were taller|`|h31I5hSAaa	if they are nice and stuff i really dont care how tall a guy is.|`|a4eca20886ed5136a1b67933a28ef01baa	I am 5'9" and I wouldn't care if the guy I dated was shorter than me but if he was like REALLY shorter than me I think it would be awkward.|`|uAzToWC7aa	some are hot and i wish that they would grow, but no offense but i cant go out with a boy shorter than me, thats just awkward for me (not trying to be mean ) < 3|`|StJGeiFyaa	i am not attracted to them at all. but that's just me. my cousin is 5'11" and married to a guy who's 5'6"|`|sQFnEgMxaa	I don't mind short guys at all but I think that unfortunately they find my height intimidating.
XUYayi27aa	You should be able to change it in about a month. Although the full healing process of the cartilage piering takes about a year. I have alot of piercings on my ear (2industrial, 2tragus, 2rook, 6 lobe pierings, 2 conch) If it still hurts to the touch next month, don't change it quite yet.|`|1dd44c89faf7f7709f97e2c11f6c358eaa	leave it in for at least four weeks just to be safe. that's what i did for mine. oh and don't slide the piercing, its not like a lobe piercing. or at least that's what my lady told me|`|H77rQYmsaa	I think the other responses are too soon in their estimates.  Cartilage piercings are generally quoted to take 6-12 months to heal.  Another answer gave good advice in saying if it hurts, don't change it.  I'd say 4 months.  I say this because, along with having many cartilage piercings done, I got an industrial about 6 months before starting a job that required me to remove it every day for work.  Although it seemed healed, and had been the minimum quoted time for "fully healed", taking it in and out this frequently prompted trouble.  SO: you'll probably be ok to change it once it stops being sore (i'd use sleeping on it as a good indicator), but only do so once and a while, or else you might risk irritating it. It will seem healed long before it really is, so keep care when changing it that first time.
XbsswQDoaa	Septum<br>  I love them at the moment, I really want mine pierced!<br>  And for work, you can just flip it up instead of taking it out if you want.|`|zmjAccMFaa	Monroe.<br>  Nostril.<br>  <br>  Those are more conservative piercings.|`|fa1EcIH8aa	I got my monroe done,<br>  and its so hot.<br>  :)<br>  you should think about that.<br>  but you should also put a picture of yourself up so i could give you a better idea.<br>  <br>  another great piercing is the septum!<br>  it looks so good,<br>  and you can hide it without even taking it out!<br>  its perfect.<br>  and if you get a scar or hole, you wont be able to see it cause its inside your nose! :)<br>  <br>  hope i helped:)
BRFkc8pBaa	In an unhealthy manner. Yes. It wont keep you from being fat though, it will just concentrate your fatness to other areas.|`|QxTIkv3Jaa	bad idea wear it a few times but not that much especically when u sleep why do u wanna flatten it then
n41yoBzFaa	yes I have used it. it Makes your hair very soft. I have not used it to make my hair grow faster though. But it has definitely made my hair a lot softer and gives it a very pretty shine.
C4PAtlNBaa	Reveal a lot of neck.  Necks don't have to be long, but have a low neckline makes it look like they're longer.<br>  <br>  Where more solid stuff.  Half my wardrobe is solid colors, but what's important is that it fits me well.  When you wear a solid colors your shape is more apparent.  So if you're going to wear them, make sure its not too loose, but not too tight either.  <br>  <br>  Color also plays an important role in appeal.  Many studies have shown that men seem to find a woman more attractive when she wears red.  But also black is the essence of class and elegance (and it also does killer things for your figure).  Look at Audrey Hepburn.  Also don't wear too many different colors at once.  Take a look at a color wheel, see what goes with what.<br>  <br>  Skip out on little frills like lace & etc.  If you want to avoid being all boring and solid you can accent it with hints of pattern in your accessories (shoes, bag, headband, etc).  I hate hate hate animal print, but I can tolerate it when its only on someones shoes or on their bag.  Or you can dress up through your jewelry.  Keep the jewelry simple.  If you have extravagant earrings (dangling or not) keep the necklace calm or don't wear one at all.  If you have an extravagant necklace stick to cute post earrings.<br>  <br>  Basically, if you want to wear something really crazy and stands out, keep it to only one piece. Have that article of clothing be the main focus and have everything else you wear just compliment it.|`|AA10010260	In the first place, it is spelled overboard; not over bored. First go back to school to learn how to spell - get a fricking education. No one wants a dumbass. Second, when you go out, don't wear any clothes at all. No one will notice, trust me - should make you feel hot if nothing else.|`|NCvvwPEdaa	Try indian style like lehangas or salwar. I cannot resist to take off my eyes from a girl wearing this, looks very attractive
TCpTlCTRaa	If you have access to a trichologist in your vicinity that may be the best staring point. They can examine your scalp and hair and determine the type of hair loss.

BitAsc8daa	You look average.  Go on a diet, exercise 3 - 4 times a week for about an hour at a time.  Do a LOT of ab exercises so it burns until you can't take it anymore.<br>  <br>  After a month you will start looking good.|`|1dd44c89faf7f7709f97e2c11f6c358eaa	do more cardio, cause i can see the muscles under there, but you need to get a little bit of fat off your abs.|`|nZgZWrGWaa	im thinking beer belly??

jiOGmVlSaa	hmm, well what is in is :<br>  long hair near, right at yoru boobs is a good length, with a lot of layers in it<br>  your layers should be 3 inches, the shortest from the top of your head<br>  this will give you volume and height, <br>  if you want the more exotic look, instead of side bangs, get blunt, or thin frotn bangs, adn do yoru eyebrows aswell<br>  but only get frotn bangs if you haev a narrow face, not a round one<br>  <br>  as for clothes, try cardigans, beaters, skinnys, stockings with shorts, and mix and match with everything. like a dance shirt with leggings, and converse, and tease yoru hair fron tiem to time<br>  this will look nice, with yoru frotn bangs, and it will be easier to tease your hair with the layers. <br>  <br>  as for the rest of yrou wardrobe, dotn just stick to one style, mix up everythign with preppy and sporty, and funky, :)<br>  <br>  as for your makeup, just a bit of eyelioner and mascara, and curl yoru eyelashes, thast all you really need<br>   good luck !   :)
JySB8dOZaa	I think the 1st ones will look so cute on you! Just make they're not above your eyebrows! Keep them just resting on your eyelashes and it will really pretty. BTW, you are really beautiful and your hair is amazing, such good condition and lovely colour and shine x|`|XADP739faa	Don't exactly want to turn upside down to look at your photo, but get the 2nd option of bangs because i like them better.|`|tObHGRGDaa	i think those bangs with straight hair would really suit your face shape!<br>  i guess cuz i never really understood the curly hair but straight bangs phaze. good luck!!!|`|duvefvbQaa	honeslty i dont think they will look good cuz of the way ur chin is i think it look good the way it is now|`|9kwzNM2paa	i like the second bangs, your really pretty!|`|P26ekyGWaa	that'd be cutee :)|`|n41yoBzFaa	Totally get bangs. They are very high fashion and look great on almost anyone. Either one of those pictures would look great on you. Just get a LOT of layers and maybe tease your hair too to give you a really edgy look.|`|AA12359916	Umm i think the second because you kinda have a heart shape face, except your chin is not that narrow, but, also chose 2 because it can turn into side swept bangs! (very in for asians)|`|t8xmi7N3aa	I actually like both of them,<br>  But i think that the first one would look better on you :)<br>  But make sure you keep it below your eyebros and above your eyelashes.<br>  Hope I helped.<br>  <br>  P.S: You are really pretty :D

So when girls ask that other girls are mean, but when boys ask it the girls are ok with it because they think the guy is hot.|`|ZxKLOqAlaa	i agree<br>   <br>  <br>  haha mine?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai5GpczloHlujpg3RFwy_obsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090304215601AA5kVca">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|sAi6T0pSaa	I think it's the same either way as far as asking if one is pretty.  Personally I believe everyone is good looking in their own way, but one must stay humble to be pretty inside.
sOkTUYq7aa	I would say.. try Neutrogena.  It seems okay for you, but a lot of people found it very drying.  So test it first before you use it on your whole face.  But I agree, Clean and Clear have really good products.. and garnier is good for combination skin|`|14tr16uuaa	I know all about the fair skin problem (every possible problem on your face is basically a flashing sign on your skin, ugh)<br>  <br>  I like DOVE deep moisturizing facial lotion.<br>  <br>  Clean and Clear deep cleanser works for me, but I also like Noxzema.|`|Lrw0Chojaa	I use clean and clear continuous acne control cleanser to wash my face and the I put on clean and clear oil free dual action moisturizer and my skin is not dry not oily nor very pimply  ive been using it since i was in like the 9th grade and now im 18 <br>  but everyones skin is different <br>  but whatever you do dont wash your face with soap only face wash<br>  . its better to just wash uour face with warm water if you dont have face wash <br>  good luck|`|O4qO8aoLaa	To find out what kind of skin type you should go to www.clinique.com.  Click on the skin report tab at the top and fill out the little questionaire.  I have used Clinique for years.  They have a wonderful 3 step.  It has a cleanser, clarifying lotion, and moisturizer.  I have sensitive skin and I can only use them.  Up front its a little expensive cause its at the mall.  Its about 50.00 but it will last you the whole year.  If you go to their bonus time you get free stuff if you spend 22.00 or more.  At the least you can find out what kind of skin type you are.|`|p7Zz8rKyaa	Try Dermalogica or Murad products. They are a bit more exspensive but they are better quality then grocery store products and if you want something that really works your gunna have to pay more for it. If you have combo skin like me then you should give these products a try. : ) I work at purebeauty and have had really good experiences helping people with these products. Another thing to think about it the makeup you are using. Jane Iredale is an option you might want to try. Their whole line is based on keeping your skin healthy and not using fillers or preservatives that most makeup companies do.

AA11938604	It would certainly be an interesting topic of study.  Off hand, (no pun intended) what I do know is the reason we wear wedding and engagement rings on the ring finger of the left hand goes back to an ancient Egyptian belief that there was a nerve that ran from that finger directly to the heart.  I knew somebody from Romania once and they have a tradition where the husband to be, wears his wedding ring on his right hand ring finger until the wedding day.  That way the other ladies know it’s hands off!  I’ve heard, though I can’t say for sure so don’t send me any hateful e-mails, that homosexuals (possibly only men) will wear a ring on their pinky finger to signify their homosexuality.  Like I say, I don’t know if that’s true, just something I heard.  As far as the other fingers are concerned I don’t know of any significance other than purely ornamental.|`|AaXl5YYkaa	i think on the left middle finger is where a promise ring goes.|`|yRtPyDyjaa	You can wear  your ring wherever you like. Except for birthstones which are said to be worn on a particular finger. For example: It is advised to wear a pearl set in silver, on the little finger on any hand. Ruby is supposed to be worn on the right hand ring finger. Otherwise a ring can be worn as per individual preferences.

I agree on the skin tone/hair color though.|`|PxCMYmrwaa	1rst one is cuter but the colour is ugly(sorry)<br>  The second one looks like a mix of gothic, punk, princess.

Spring dances seem more inclined to pastel colors or white rather than black.  See if the dress has some color options :)|`|PqUXnWZGaa	I think its a gorgeous dress for a spring dance, but you should add some gold designs to it, like add tiny little golden starts or something to the top only.|`|vWRk0gViaa	Its adorable!!!

akbvn3uMaa	First of all, gain confidence!!! I assume you need to gain some since you're asking strangers how to make yourself look better. Know that you're gorgeous, and rock your look!<br>  <br>  Second, the first pic looks like Ashley Tisdale. A lot. lol.<br>  The last pic looks like your ordinary teen. Yee-yeah! Braces rock!!! (I have them too!)<br>  <br>  And, no you don't want more oily skin. It always looks like your sweaty, and you're more prone to breakouts. Also, if you have dry skin, I avoid some oil-free face washes. They make my oily skin super dry. <br>  <br>  Just use a daily moisturizor (for the face not body.) M.A.C always has ahmazing makeups, but Covergirl is pretty good quality for a nice price. Go to your local Sephora or Department store (JCP, Macy's, etc.) and their makeup counter can help you see which colors look best on you, and fit with your lifestyle.|`|dat8eoYyaa	u dont look like n e celb. go tanning, u look pretty n those pictures|`|O4qO8aoLaa	You are a very beautiful girl.  You need some self confidence.  A lot of girls would kill to look like you.  Dont compare yourself to celebrities.    They arent real anyways.  It takes a long time to look like them.  <br>  <br>  If you want to brighten yourself up you could get a new hairstyle.  Something you CAN DO AT HOME.  Some of these salons have great stylists but its really hard to get that same look at home.  You can try parting your hair a different way.  <br>  <br>  Make-up wise I wouldnt get the cheap make-up but not expensive either.  Covergirl or Maybeline is good stuff.  Get oil free.  Colorwise you should stick with natural colors and pale pinks for your cheeks and lips.  The best skin care regimen for me is Clinique.  I have sensitive skin and I cant use over the counter stuff at the drug store.  They have the best 3 step.  Cleanser, Clarifying Lotion, and Moisturizer that rocks.  www.clinique.com.  Good Luck.|`|aAO8wq1Xaa	I think you need to conceal your dark undereye circles and maybe darken and narrow your brows. I would just improve the overall look of your eyes...because you look sad...no offense. Brighten them up with plum shadow and thichkening mascara. That looks good on anyone.<br>  <br>  I also think you should go redhead.

ADX5N1etaa	A girl I know had her tongue pierced and literally had to live on Slurpees for a week. <br>  <br>  Other than that, there's not too much you can eat in the way of solid food. When I got my wisdom teeth out, I ate Wendy's frostys, Jello, and soup for about a week. So don't worry, you'll be able to eat solid foods soon, but for now you should stick with soft, liquidy foods. You don't want to agitate the piercing by trying to chew anything and have it mess with the ring/get in the opening.|`|duvefvbQaa	well i had surgery in my mouth and it made my chin jaw  and lips really numb and such so and the only foods i really could eat was mash potatoes yogurt cream of brocolie soup ice cream stuff that very easy to swallow but it was only like a week so i suggest u try those types of foods|`|tWePoJYNaa	I'm really sorry.

Also has to fit your personality.  Its a ballgown and a princess type of dress.  I dont know you so I couldnt tell if it would fit your personality.  What you wear has to dignify you.  At least thats how I see it.  Hope that helped.  If you live in the country or hick town I wouldnt recommend wearing that.  Too fancy for that.|`|30fb1deb3af3cac33a857b6a3b543148aa	Personally, i think it is too formal. However the best thing to do is look at what other people are wearing. If all the other girls are buying floor length gowns then go for it, but you might feel awkward if everyone else is in cocktail dresses.|`|HxdqZojpaa	i think it's cute, BUT it's too frilly and big.

I definitely think the pink is the best!|`|2HNrT4Cwaa	I think this is perfect after all this is your prom and with hope you will probably remember this night for the rest of your life. so no not too much just follow your heart.....|`|NutVkFrIaa	beautiful, it would be my first choice also. have fun you will look gorgeous|`|QwpRD7DUaa	its gorgeoussss.<br>  <br>  geet it . lol
PQzrsXsKaa	I wouldn't. Go to a professional hair salon and have them straighten your hair. They should be able to do even really curly hair.|`|154dzJ1Faa	While it sounds great, and you would think that having straight hair can be so wonderful, you need to investigate it quite fully.  It is extremely damaging to the hair, and there are some really careful and special things you need to do to keep it that way.<br>  <br>  Yes, you do have to think about re-growth as well.  Half of this or that is not pretty!  It is going to be expensive to get done, and to look after.<br>  <br>  Leaving things alone is always the best.  Perhaps you have the wrong cut, and you need to learn how to work with your hair to make it work.  There are many styling options with curly hair that you don't know about.  Trying to be something you are not is never a good plan.  It takes too much work, as you already know.  And is more frustrating when you don't have the correct techniques.<br>  <br>  Have a consultation with a good honest hair stylist (who is not a friend) to learn of some of the possibilities with your hair. Learn to work WITH your hair rather than against it.  The hair will always win.|`|yoKfM5d3aa	but you're not asian|`|sOkTUYq7aa	Yes, it's a good idea, and the best option for you.  It will be a lot easier because you don't have to straighten everyday.  Also, it probably won't ruin your hair forever, because it's only straightening the ends of your hair.  If you want to be more cautious, maybe test out a section first and see if any hair falls out.|`|vOB3iVdxaa	I think it's an okay idea . I'd take it because it's free, but I'd make sure it's a professional salon first .|`|9CYpX1J8aa	i did that, was very drying and expensive but still worth it|`|AA11486288	no.  what if you want it curly?  believe me, straightening hair is easier than curling it.
qjCY4Y7zaa	The only soap I use, and have been told to use by proffesionals, is antibacterial body wash- unsented. It helps keep out infections, but overuse of it can cause dry skin and it can dry your piercing out. I personally wouldn't use the kind of soap you're talking about on a piercing, but I definetly recommend using antibacterial body wash.|`|H7qhcFBzaa	It is very much okay.|`|tgCNwQ2Saa	yes, it's totally ok to use it...

mQprRQHgaa	Be confident, just put up a picture. You could be the ugliest person in the world, but if you had a confident personality, lots of people would like you. There isn't an AVERAGE situation btw, everyone is different. No one can help you if they don't have an idea of you.|`|FU5vYxflaa	pic please|`|Nwp0YwnQaa	i need a pic please!<br>  but just be proud of ur self =]
