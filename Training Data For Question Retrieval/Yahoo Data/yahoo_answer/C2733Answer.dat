Stay away from him for several minutes - 3 or 4 minutes, but not much longer.  Then go back and play with him again.  If he bites, yell at the top of your lungs, get up and walk away from  him.  Again, stay away from him for several minutes.  Do this each and every time he bites, and have everyone in your family do it, and within a week, he won't bite any more.  You see, when puppies are playing with each other, and one hurts the other, the one who gets hurt yelps and stops playing.  That's how puppies learn not to bite their playmates.|`|60FBuhyGaa	Sounds funny but bite them back. I taught my husky this and hes 5 months old. You only need to quickly bite them. This teaches them two things A) it hurts to be bitten B) that you can bite back. Also your dog needs to learn its place in your family by biting him back you are saying you are the alpha  dog in your family. My bro in law and several friends of mine suggested this... My huskey doesnt bite me anymore.|`|m5CohJNjaa	thats easy. a bit of lead behind the ear will fix the problem|`|q9WzCw5Paa	When he bites you...make a high pitched yelping sound. This will tell the dog it is hurting you. As sometimes the dog is not taught about pain. When he releases his mouth pat him and tell him he is a good dog. This may need to be repeated up to 30 times until it stops. My dog went through the same thing. He was taken from his mother at 5 weeks
9agsygrMaa	i think he isnt inerested because hes so young. i think he is just descovering the world and you should give him a break for a while. dont get rid of him because he cant hunt rabbits!!! that would be like killing a human because they cant or wont eat a certain type of food. if you really want a hunter, go to a breeder and ask for her opinion if you want to add another dog to your family for hunting, i think they would get along fine because the dog you have now is so young.|`|ugJUPjGqaa	don't get him to eat the rabbits! thats cruel
s9OOyEjXaa	the same thing happened to me. i have 2 budgies a male and a female and the female has been going in and out of her nest house . i thought she was sick until i saw my 2 budgies mating but she still kept staying in her nest house for long periods of time. i started to get worried until i checked inside the nest box to see what she was doing, and to my surprise she had laid an egg!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :)|`|fw6JQnP9aa	Hello there<br>  <br>  I would recomend talking to a vet about your four paraeekts as they might be unwell or suffering from something else.<br>  <br>  I am sorry i wasn't of any help.
AA10853273	You are feeding him way way way too much. Dogs will eat non-stop if you let them. You have to feed them the proper amount. You will find the proper serving size on the side of the dog food bag. Cats are very different - they will only eat until they are full. Dogs will eat until they make themselves sick. Please only feed your dog the recommended amount each day, and give him some exercise.|`|c6277adeaf34d4d7f97894265a648776aa	Just feed him at supper time.... 1 bowl a day.....<br>  and all the water he can drink....it's called a doggy diet....that's what we did 2 my brothers dog......|`|Ljqgbtxvaa	Don't do this. Dogs will get REALLY REALLY FULL before they stop. I have seen MANY dogs die because they are overweight. You should give your dog some dog meat in the morning, and a cup of kibble in the evening. Don't keep food on the floor non-stop. :( EVER. you can feed it treats in the daytime, but if it starts gaining a lot of weight you will end up with a dog that dies at 4. Good luck though. If you follow a planned diet your dog will be fine.|`|00vNv6O4aa	There are soem breed of dogs who dont seem to know when to stop eating, this is very unhealthy but an easy fix, you will have to have feeding times. Just like for people, give them a cup or so in the morning, and same in the evening. Most dog food bags will have direction on them as to how much to feed per size of dog. <br>  <br>  Make sure to walk them at least once a day or at least have an open area for them to run and get soem excersize.|`|0c3C9FTSaa	Stop feeding the dog the food. The dog isnt preparing the food its self so just limit the portion intake.|`|tQagsRIYaa	Well, everyone said it, stop feeding you dog so much.<br>  <br>  This is true, a lot is to be siad with the type of food you feed him. Some dogs are pigs, they won't stop eating, it sounds like you will need to start with feeding him only what the guidlines say on the side of the bag. These are only "guidlines" If your dog gains wait over time, then you know you should feed him a lil, less, or cut out the treats. If he loses weight you will need to give him more food. I recommend to keep him off of table scraps, Dogs can't digest human food as well and it can make them sick...and it teaches them bad habits. <br>  <br>  However, look at the ingredient list on the food you feed him. This is important!!! The first five ingredients are what the food mostly contains, if it says Meat by-product it is basically dirty meat. Sadly I found that this means it can be roadkill, dirty meat, guts of animals, and even other dogs or cats. Bizare I know, but thats what they do, and that's why cheap foods have "by-products" in them. Keep away from Corn, Wheat, and Soy. Each one of these are hard for the dogs to digest, and they are cheap fillers; meaning your dog will eat more of it and poo more of it on your lawn. No joke, stay away from By-products, corn, wheat, and soy! Feed your dog a more filling food, now grant it he may still be a pig, but you will feed less. Give those guidlines a shot too. <br>  <br>  Heres some excellend brands with no fillers and byproducts: Diamond, Premium Edge, Natural Balance, Wellness, Merrick, Nutro Natural Choice, Nutro Ultra, Canidae, Solid Gold. Give them a try!<br>  <br>  Brands I'm pretty sure have some and/or one of the fillers, or byproducts: Science Diet, Iams, Purina, Pedigree, Eukanuba, Nutro Max, Atta boy, and Ol roy. Stay Away from these, it's worse than feeding McDonalds to your dog!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, it's what i've learned form experience!<br>  CHEERS!|`|Pj0b9T4caa	BAD.|`|VXXeqxG7aa	yeah, my dog eats alot too. its getting really expensive.<br>  this is like, my 6th dog in 6 monthes.<br>  what i'm wondering is why people love dogs so much when they really dont live that long. <br>  they eat and eat and eat and poop and die in like 25 days. <br>  i think i'm all done buying dogs.|`|bT7EpOfzaa	Hahaha!  You must live with Clifford, the big red dog.<br>  <br>  I bet you're rich too... 280lbs of dog food is really expensive... I bet the poop is awful to clean up.... you must need a large lawn trash bag each time you walk him.<br>  <br>  Read the label or talk with your vet.|`|eLRF2k3laa	give the dog breakfast lunch and dinner once he eats the amount you think is right take it away so he learns that he should not be eating so much

AA12317546	Don't try to make him 'walk'... because you will be giving him the wrong message. <br>  <br>  Lure him into walking with treats....  leave the leash on him inside so that he gets used to it in a stable environment, then take him outside.  <br>  <br>  In the words of Ceasar Milan "always be calm and assertive and project that energy to your dog!"<br>  <br>  Dog Whisperer Rules!|`|RTNmTskfaa	we had a dog at school  like this he was just leash shy so just work with him try a treat when u put it on him and if he walks give him another|`|1pPw3F7gaa	You might want to take him to a vet cuz if it was my pet i wouldn't take any chances.|`|4yuzEZNKaa	Tugging at him would be the worst thing possible - he's obviously frightened of what will happen when you put the leash on him.<br>  <br>  Forget that you're trying to walk him anywhere - just clip the leash on, leave it a few secs, then treat him and remove it.  Build up until you're leaving it on for longer and longer periods, keep treating him, and eventually he will get so used to it he will get up and wander about.<br>  <br>  Once he is happy to do this at home, start touching the leash, then releasing and treating him again (clicker training would work wonderfully well here).  Build up until he is comfortable walking with you.<br>  <br>  Depending on how bad his fear is, and how quick he is to learn, this could be achieved in an hour or two, or might take days.  Don't be afraid to call a dog trainer for help if you are uncertain of doing this right - and always stay calm.  You can teach him there is nothing to fear, and that walks are great - just be patient.|`|UzPcBJ1Uaa	All dogs love 'walkies', but you need to make it a positive situation for your dog. <br>  <br>  Ie: let him walk without a leash first (if it's safe) and let him smell the trees, give him/her treats on the way etc...<br>  <br>  Then after a few of these walks, put the leash on, but dont pull, let him walk behind you without you holding onto the leash at all.....<br>  <br>  When he's used to this, then try holding the leash, BUT, dont pull, and keep those treats coming for a while...<br>  <br>  Good luck :-)|`|dea13cc88ecd819ae34427e239a63257aa	i used a technique that i would put  a dog treat on each square or like 2 ft apart to teach the dog while on the leash it is supposed to walk......spread then farther apart as he learns.......hope it works for you..........BE|`|js43giIsaa	he sounds like he is not leashed trained......you should attach a small leash to his collar and allow the dog to freely walk around with the leash hanging......eventually he will get the concept......treats help them learn quicker too. <br>  <br>  Best of Luck.....you'll see how simply and easy this type of training is!!|`|npE7j3ukaa	kick em' in teh chops!!!!!!!!!!!!11111111111111111111111...

You could finish by having a pet show- using peoples own pets and the shelters animals. This will highlight the shelters work and pets, bring the community together and raise much needed money.

Molti animali lo fanno! Devi sapere che le urine sono un segno distintivo dell'animale.

45FqZWxlaa	You have good reason to be worried.  Unless you use a water bottle and the float was stuck  -  I would assume it was caused by some kind of gas or fumes.   You may want to purchase a new carbon monoxide alarm.  They do fail.<br>  <br>  Other causes can be fresh paint, and new carpet.  Any cleaner, chemical or aerosol spray with ventilation warnings on the label are all toxic to birds.  One common culprit is bleach.<br>  <br>  Another concern are outside grills near open windows.<br>  <br>  Very sorry to hear about your birds.  My best wishes to you.|`|7ea0996112daf630f035d318bedc84adaa	It definitely sounds like gas of some kind.  Anything with fumes, from teflon, to hairspray, or even perfume can cause death. <br>  <br>  Make sure to have your carbon monoxide re-tested. Just because the mammals in your home (including yourself!) aren't suffering ill effects doesn't mean you won't later. Remember birds die before we do because their respiratory system takes in greater amounts of oxygen in one breath than we do.  Unfortunately, when poison is in the air, they take much more of that, too.  If it kills them it *can* kill you too.<br>  <br>  Try to air out all rooms today.|`|AT090n5Xaa	It does sound like some sort of toxicity, but even though you indicated there were no obvious gases in the air, and that your pet rat is fine, there does seem to be the threat of another type of gas.  Think hard:  do you use hair spray, even if it is not near the cage?  Or any other type of arisol or even a pump spray.  Car fumes nearby?  Gases can be colorless and odorless as well and you cannot detect toxic ones readily.  Any paint fumes from neighbors?  Glue or construction?  Paving from roads?  Aerial spraying?  It does not have to be in your immediate environment.  Also what have you been feeding, if other than commercial finch food, check the ingredients.  I just learned a few hours ago that onion/garlic powder is toxic to birds.  Just trying to say that things we may take for granted can harm them.  It's a learning process.

I too had to put my dog down just a few months ago and it was the worst day in my life. He was my best friend. <br>  <br>  What I would have appreciated hugely would have been for somebody to collect a few of the best photos I had of my dog, create a photo collage and have it framed. I did that for myself just recently, and while it brought tears to my eyes, it also brought smiles because I remembered the very many happy times my dog and I had to together. <br>  <br>  No stuffed animals or figurines. It would just be so inadequate to deal with the loss of a real companion.

I was also going to suggest a scrap book, a framed photo of her beloved, a donation in her name to a rescue/shelter, the Rainbow bridge. All excellent suggestions.<br>  The only thing I can add is: Be there for her. Listen and let her talk her feelings out. The biggest gift you can give anyone is for them to feel heard. Hold her while she cries and keep refreshing the tissues.<br>  Say very little except feedback. Allow her to feel her grief and get it out.  What a great friend you are.<br>  <br>  And besides the Rainbow bridge there is these two:<br>  LAST NIGHT<br>  I stood by your bed last night; I came to have a peep.<br>  I could see that you were crying you found it hard to sleep.<br>  I whined to you softly as you brushed away a tear,<br>  "It's me, I haven't left you, I'm well, I'm fine, I'm here."<br>  I was close to you at breakfast, I watched you pour the tea,<br>  You were thinking of the many times, your hands reached down to me.<br>  I was with you at the shops today; your arms were getting sore.<br>  I longed to take your parcels, I wish I could do more.<br>  I was with you at my grave today; you tend it with such care.<br>  I want to re-assure you, that I'm not lying there.<br>  I walked with you towards the house, as you fumbled for your key.<br>  I gently put my paw on you; I smiled and said, "it's me."<br>  You looked so very tired, and sank into a chair.<br>  I tried so hard to let you know, that I was standing there.<br>  It's possible for me, to be so near you everyday.<br>  To say to you with certainty, "I never went away."<br>  You sat there very quietly, then smiled, I think you knew...<br>  in the stillness of that evening, I was very close to you.<br>  The day is over... I smile and watch you yawning<br>  and say "good-night, God bless, I'll see you in the morning."<br>  And when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,<br>  I'll rush across to greet you and we'll stand, side by side.<br>  I have so many things to show you, there is so much for you to see.<br>  Be patient, live your journey out...then come home to be with me.<br>  - Author unknown <br>  AND<br>  Crystal Ward Kent ([partial of "The Journey)<br>  You will learn the true measure of love - the steadfast, undying kind that says, "It doesn't matter where we are or what we do, or how life treats us as long as we are together." Respect this always. It is the most precious gift any living soul can give another. You will not find it often among the human race. <br>  <br>  And you will learn humility. The look in my dog's eyes often made me feel ashamed. Such joy and love at my presence. She saw not some flawed human who could be cross and stubborn, moody or rude, but only her wonderful companion. Or maybe she saw those things and dismissed them as mere human foibles, not worth considering, and so chose to love me anyway. <br>  <br>  If you pay attention and learn well, when the journey is done, you will be not just a better person, but the person your pet always knew you to be - the one they were proud to call beloved friend. <br>  <br>  I must caution you that this journey is not without pain. Like all paths of true love, the pain is part of loving. For as surely as the sun sets, one day your dear animal companion will follow a trail you cannot yet go down. <br>  <br>  And you will have to find the strength and love to let them go. A pet's time on earth is far too short - especially for those that love them. <br>  <br>  We borrow them, really, just for awhile, and during these brief years they are generous enough to give us all their love, every inch of their spirit and heart, until one day there is nothing left. <br>  <br>  The cat that only yesterday was a kitten is all too soon old and frail and sleeping in the sun. The young pup of boundless energy wakes up stiff and lame, the muzzle now gray. Deep down we somehow always knew that this journey would end. We knew that if we gave our hearts they would be broken. <br>  <br>  But give them we must for it is all they ask in return. When the time comes, and the road curves ahead to a place we cannot see, we give one final gift and let them run on ahead - young and whole once more. <br>  <br>  "Godspeed, good friend," we say, until our journey comes full circle and our paths cross again.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	I usually appreciate a donation in my dog's name to a charity I support (Basset Hound rescue, in my case).<br>  <br>  Another good idea is to get a good picture of the dog and have a nicely framed portrait, painting or sketch made (depending on your budget).

So he says, "Grandfather, are these plates clean?" His grandfather replies, "Those plates are as clean as cold water can get them, so go on and finish your meal." That afternoon, while eating the hamburgers his grandfather made for lunch, he noticed many little black specks around the edge of his plate so again he asked, "Grandfather are you sure these plates are clean?" Without looking up from his burger, the grandfather says, "I told you those dishes are as clean as cold water can get them, now don't ask me about it anymore." Well, later that day, they were on their way out to get dinner. As he was leaving the house, grandfather's dog who was lying on the floor started to growl and would not let him pass. "Grandfather, your dog won't let me out." Without diverting his attention from the football game he was watching, his grandfather shouted, "Coldwater, get your butt out of the way!"|`|AfUuRLsbaa	Captain Cambodia!<br>  Todd!<br>  Sock!<br>  Number 18!<br>  TheDogFormallyKnownAsNoName ~ <- i Like it.<br>  Nom (as in name)<br>  Label!|`|AA12364062	Bruin as in the Boston Bruins!|`|dXNcjGwCaa	Dario|`|glG967Fuaa	Biscuit or Panelopie!|`|kifwyOgKaa	Reyna.

Those dogs would be better off if they "ran away" and you or another kind soul took them in.|`|JsBb732Maa	Keep calling and if you have any neighbor friends get them to call also. Call a local news agency and see if they will do a human interest story on the plight of these poor dogs that you can't get any help for. Good luck:)|`|AA10076207	hi. i know the feeling. we had a dog that we "rescued" from abusive owners(they weren't feeding it, it drank water out a dank kiddy pool,and was tied on a 6 inch rope to the porch,and had had her head used as an ashtray. not to mention someone tried to cut her back leg tendons. we got her healthy and got her w/a friend who works w/a hound rescue org. she's now in New Jersey in a forever home on 100 acres! <br>  <br>  My advice to you would be document what you see every day. write everything down. even the times you call the aspca. if you have a video camera, use it. evidence, evidence, evidence. Good Luck,and Bless you for helping those who can't help themselves!|`|YoZZDqq9aa	Call the animal control officer, or the aspca, again.  If you're a kid, have your parents do it. Don't stop fighting for these dogs. If you must, call the police. Call the rescue shelters. Call the dog pound. Call your vet and see if he will intervene on your behalf. God must have sent you to help them. Don't ever quit.|`|S9B8Fr4daa	call them again and tell them about your encounter... that you saw them being yanked around and know that it had been a while since they had had food or water or love for that matter|`|4zp6Uz2Haa	call the aspca again, repeated complaints get more attention.|`|gJlxZdL5aa	Call again and get the neighbors to call to if they are concerned...repeated complaints help|`|7OrFHW4laa	something has to be done no animal should be treated like that   i would call the police and see what they can do  at least maby they can suggest something  make sure you tell them everything because that<br>   is animal abuse  here in mich they would not get away with it  good luck with it and bless you for wanting to help the poor thing|`|551d897f0abf6a9c090f9e8bea28b76daa	call the aspca and ask to speak to the manager...if noone there at the time is the manager ask when they will be in...keep fighting...tell them that if they choose to do nothing for these animals then they are just as responsible for their condition as the owner is because they choose to turn their head when it is their job to fight for these animals who are being taken care of poorly....call the cops also and tell them what had happened...write down EVERYTHING so you can use this as evidence...also as you pass on your walk take a picture of the dogs and take it to the police station if you would rather talk to an officer in person than over the phone (in my experience this worked better than talking on the phone because they cannot pretend to listen or roll their eyes)....sometimes you need to be firm and remind them of their job duties before they start to take action...|`|8edxE24Naa	keep calling and calling have friends call as well...the more call the more they'll be pressured to check it out. Take pictures, if possible keep a record of everything for like a week even write down the times you called the aspc, write down also the names of the people you talked to in the aspca. and if possible and have in hand a video camera or even with you phone camera record it and have evidence. but keep trying don't give up. Good Luck and keep on trying. |`|rGlJ2FbUaa	Can you take photo's to document the facts? Are there other people in the area who will join with you to fight this?  The more people upset by this the stronger your chance of helping these dogs. Document all calls to aspca etc and their response. Document names, times etc.<br>  Check what the local laws are re having shelter, being tied up, food and water access. Photo the empty containers, the dogs etc. Are the dogs properly licensed?<br>  Once you have enough documented you can go to the media both newspaper and tv and shine a spot light on the situation shaming the aspca into doing something.<br>  These are the most frustrating situations. You sound like a wonderful caring person speaking for those who cannot speak for themselves. Best of luck.|`|rMzEt909aa	I would call the ASPCA again and again until they come out and investigate and do their job!!!  Make sure you get the names of all you talk with, and the times, etc.  Those dogs are being horribly abused and this person should never be allowed to have another dog, and should be fined or put in jail!<br>  I applaud you for wanting to help by taking his dog to your home and putting flea meds on it, but you should never do this with another person's dog without their consent.  Should something happen to that dog, you could get blamed in some way. And anyway, the flea meds will only last so long, and as long as they are allowed to live in these filthy conditions, they will just continue eating these dogs alive.  <br>  I think I would take a some pictures of the conditions you find these dogs in, and show them to the ASPCA and tell them if they won't do anything, you will find someone who will.  This tells me the ASPCA in your area is a very uncaring place, and makes me wonder about the care of the animals in their 'shelter'.  <br>  Is there not some other animal organization you can contact that might look into this matter of the two abused and neglected dogs?  I hope there is.  It just breaks my heart to think of those poor dogs being treated this way, and wonder why people even have dogs when they obviously don't want to care for them.<br>  <br>  Good luck in finding someone who will care enough to investigate this cruel man and take those dogs away from him.
rGlJ2FbUaa	One barks signaling possible danger and the other joins in. Then the person(s) on the other side go away. To the dogs this says there was danger and they succeeded in chasing the danger off. Same thing happens with letter carriers. With this kind of success they keep it up.<br>  <br>  It could help defuse the situation by going to your neighbours and apologizing while explaining you are working to resolve it. Then they know what's going on while they have to live with it.  Ask if anyone would be willing to help them out with the advice below. After all they and the dogs will be seeing each other so if they get a chance to know each other that would be a huge help. They know you will have the dog(s) securely on a leash.<br>  <br>  The dogs are unclear on what is their territory and what is not.<br>  You have to model that there is no problem and keep the dogs focused on you.  It would probably be easier to work with one dog at a time or have one person working with one dog. Re-direct their focus to you by asking them to sit or lay down or shake a paw whatever. Anything that shows you are so unconcerned by these other people that you can ignore them.<br>  It's important to teach a Quiet command. Any action you label you control.<br>  See if you can find someone the dogs don't know to help you out. Have that person walk into the breezeway and ignore the dogs for a bit while you redirect the focus back to you. Tell them "quiet"/"shhh" whatever command you use. If they do, use lots of praise.   When the dogs are calmer, walk over to this person and have them ask the dogs to sit (this tells the dogs this person is more dominant then them) and then they can give the dog a treat.<br>  If they continue to bark, go inside so they get a consequence for barking. They are being removed and losing the situation versus being successful at chasing the other away.  Wait a minute or two then come back out and repeat til they get it.  There is a learning curve.<br>  <br>  The water bottle thing tells them what Not to do but teaching is about what you Do want. Ir can be frustrating to be told No. What we all want is to be told what is the thing to do.<br>  As difficult as it sounds for you to do good hard exercise is very good for them right now. They are young, energetic and questioning what is going on in their world. Exercise does wonders for dogs.<br>  |`|x8Vgu6acaa	You said you have done training.  Put them on a sit stay when you are locking the door.  If they start barking at someone, Correct them and put them back on a sit stay.  Reward them for sitting quietly.  When you are walking thru the breezeway keep them at a heel.  If they start to bark at someone, correct them and walk the other way. Or tell them to "watch me".  If they walk quietly past someone without barking or someone walks past them and they do not bark. reward them.  You may have to do this one dog at a time at first.  Enlist the help of a friend or neighbor to walk back & forth while you teach the dogs to focus on you. <br>  <br>  If you have not taught them these things yet.  the commands you need to teach them are.  Sit, Stay, Watch me. and Heel.   <br>  The theory is positive rewards to make listening to you more pleasurable than barking at the people.  It does work.<br>  |`|7rCVptKBaa	No.  Use the praise reward technique.  First, distract them when they bark.  Say thank you and give them a treat.  Go to them when they bark. Say "Shh" and praise them.  When they quiet give them a treat.  After a while they will learn if they are quiet, it is what you want.|`|AA11157559	My dog barks to get out and barks when outside. In my dogs case he barks for a variety of reasons.

It doesn't sound like your dogs are excessively barking, and if they aren't, there would be no recourse for anyone to take anyways.<br>  <br>  I have used a bark collar on my dog, and it has worked wonderfully.  No, I don't keep it on all day.  There are certain times I don't want her to bark, and she knows that when the collar is on, there ARE consequences for barking.  Most don't ever want to use this option, but, it does work.<br>  <br>  Add: It doesn't matter what people *think* they are, you know they aren't... and if your dogs do nothing to prove them right, then there is no issue.
uGFzzLYWaa	I don't think it has anything to do with the size of your dog. I have a Boxer who is just right in weight and size, but he's a greedy boy. He will do the same things, eat his food and want someone else's, lick spills off of the floor and man, when he hears the bag of Doritos, he's right there, almost as if by magic.  <br>  Some dogs are just weasels that way, and will eat and eat and eat if you let them. <br>  I'm sure you are feeding him right and the dog food is fine.

Use it for fleas, and ifyou get ticks, alternate with Frontline.  You only need to use about half the Advantage they prescribe, and using it every 2 months instead of once a month will work just as well.<br>  Once the fleas are gone, you can use it just once a year in the summer unless you are some place where it doesn't get very cold.

Good luck!<br>  |`|xJhfxnEtaa	Either will work fine! I use Revolution once a month on my dog and it keeps the ticks and fleas away, even when an infestation has started.  I think Frontline and Advantage also offer the once-a-month pipettes that you can apply to the back of your dog's neck. (yup, that's all that's required!)  Be sure to pick the formula geared to your dog's weight. I think Frontline also offers a tick spray of sorts, that can be used if the infestation is really bad, but that gets messy.  Anyway, I've used sprays and collars before, but they don't work as well as the once-a-month pipettes. 
VdeV0jUqaa	How to get your pet microchipped? Or how to implant a microchip?<br>  How to get a pet microchipped is easy:<br>  1) take your animal to the vet or animal shelter, etc<br>  2) fill out registration papers for microchip identification<br>  3) have the professional chip your pet<br>  4) pay the fee<br>  <br>  To actually microchip an animal? You require training to do this- but I think its still pretty simple- something like:<br>  1) load the implanter with the microchip<br>  2) pick up scruff of animals neck and make a v with it with your fingers so you have an area the shot can go into<br>  3) insert needle so it goes under the animals skin<br>  4) inject the microchip<br>  5) fill out paperwork<br>

xT024KMsaa	Basset makes a point. It is their dog and isn't bothering them, so it is in your hands if you want it trained. If you want to train it, you are lucky- to some degree. Border collies are one of the most trainable breeds! They are intelligent and quite responsive. Some time, patience and a few packs of training treats are all that are needed.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	It's their house and their dog, they can do what they like.

Put one of those small latches on the top, or get a new handle with a key..Surely the dog doesn't know how to open locked doors.  You are in for a whole bunch of misery in life unless you change your selfish attitude just a little bit.  Your whole question, while it wasn't really a question, was I, I, I and ME ME ME.  I hope you feel guilty when you read this, because that will be your que to know that it is true.<br>  <br>  This border collie could be your best friend and loyal companion.  If you want the dog to change, YOU are going to have to do it.  Obviously your parents are to incompetent to see what is clearly in front of them: A puppy (yes, one year is still a puppy) who has no doggy manners whatsoever.<br>  <br>  So, I have come up with a few "house rules."  These rules apply to YOU, and you also need to get your parents on board.<br>  1. Stop free feeding the dogs.  Feed once in the morning at 9:00 am and once in the evening at 6:00 pm.  This will limit the amout of poo the dogs need to deficate.<br>  2.  Get a dog door, so the dogs have access to go outside and do their business.  If this is not an option, train the dog to ring a bell whenever it needs to go out.<br>  3.  (This is the rule you are goint to hate...) This dog obviously needs much more physical and mental stimulation than it is getting.  Border collies are quirky, and I would almost NEVER suggest a normal family to buy one.  However, now you have one.  He needs two, one hour walks a day.  (not kidding)  Or combined with other fun forms of excersise.  A couple of hours in a dog park.  Off lead bike ride.  Fetching a ball or frisbee.  Agility.  Flyball.  The sky is the limit, here, just get the poor dog outside and running.<br>  4.  Training.  If none of you have had any formal classes, I would suggest joining your local all breed club.  They should have all levels of obedience, and maybe some accelerated classes for your smart BC. <br>  5.  Stop screaming at the dog.  Dogs don't understand english.  How would you feel if some guy started screaming at you in french?  You need to calm down, miss priss.<br>  6.  You should tell your mom that the dog is off limits to her for a week, so that you can get some training done.  (yeah right)  She is enforcing bad behaviour.  This is really bad training.<br>  <br>  This is a good start.  Again, the dog will not change itself.  It simply does not know how.  YOU are going to have to step up to the plate.  Won't your parents be impressed if you can get this dog under control.<br>  <br>  Good luck, seriously.  If you need more help, you can always email me. |`|AA11244754	A) a dog is still going to have puppy tendencies until after the age of 2 (as in having lots of energy and jumping on the bed to tell you good morning)<br>  B) go ahead and start looking for your own place since you are not willing to put up with your parents new pet, you can still save up but it will be slower than you wanted it.<br>  C) if you can't sit down with your parents and talk to them in a MATURE manner then don't whine on here like a spoiled, ungrateful brat!<br>  D) as somebody else said CLOSE YOUR BEDROOM DOOR when your are gone and if it doesn't close right make sure to put your stuff up<br>  E) they must have had a gun to your head to make you move in when you must've known that they had a dog (like when you went home on christmas and spring breaks) so you SHOULD HAVE known what to expect<br>  <br>  You can't yell at the dog and put him outside for some unless you catch them in that act they won't understand why you are mad so that is completely counter productive since dogs have a short attention span.  <br>  <br>  Just put your shoes in your closet and if you have to, on the top shelf and pack your stuff up because if you can't deal with this situation call some of your friends and see if you can stay with them and start looking for a room to rent immediately since you can't deal with this situation.|`|LBnDEWgRaa	I understand your frustration, but that won't solve the problem.  You moved into their house, so you can deal with it by ignoring the bad behavior (which will continue to frustrate you), or by improving the dog's behavior through training.  <br>  <br>  Hopefully, your parents will pick up on your training and see what a better -- and happier -- dog he can be when trained.<br>  <br>  Also, can't you keep your bedroom door closed to keep the dog out?|`|LcdaUleUaa	Well chill a little bit first.  This isn't a website for ranting and raving.   The dogs will feed off your energy too, so you always have to put out the "alpha" vibes.<br>  <br>  First up, close your bedroom door.  Keep whatever you want to stay safe, in your room.  I don't understand why you haven't already done this, so I'm going to assume that the entrance to your sleeping area is always open.  In which case, you gotta just suck it up and 'puppy proof' your area.  Sure, it's up to your parents to monitor the dog, but you still need to do your part.  There's no reason to tempt a poorly behaved dog with a bunch of crap they can get into.<br>  <br>  It's your parents' dog and their problem, so you're right, there's not a whole lot you can do here unless you want to train him yourself.  Or move out.<br>  <br>  Do you go out exercising much?  Running, biking, etc?  Bring the dog with you.  Collies have a ridiculous amount of energy, and you can tear down a lot of their bad behavior just by giving them an outlet.  Make that dog run it's *** off outside.   It's easy to do and will bring his behavior down to a more manageable level.<br>  <br>  I don't know if you can do much more then that though because your mother is refusing to take part in training the dog.   Anything you do, will just be undone by her during the day because she might not keep up with the training.   Hopefully it will be easier to convince her though once you see an improvement just from exercising the dog.<br>  <br>  I know it's not your responsibility to train this dog, but if you want to live at home in peace, you're gonna have to take the reins on this one.|`|EyxjUTeGaa	You may have to use all your diplomatic skills to get your mother to sign up for some advanced dog training for her and the dog.

The agreement with your folks is broken. It is their dog, their house and it's wreaking havoc on your relationship.<br>  I know the plan was so you could save some money but it isn't working from what you said.

The naturally occurring theobromine found in chocolate, cocoa beans, cocoa bean hulls, cola, and tea, is responsible for the poisoning effect in dogs.  Dogs are unable to metabolize this element quickly enough to prevent poisoning.  The lethal dose of this agent is determined by weight and falls roughly into the category of 250-500 milligrams per kilogram of body weight.  This equates to approximately 2/3 to 1 1/3 oz bakers chocolate for every 2.2 pounds though signs of poisoning begin to appear at a much lower ingestion levels. |`|v0RsFaAzaa	Chocolate Toxicity, can kill any breed of dog.

It's more of how much theobromine there is in the chocolate they ate. That chemical in chocolate is what's toxic to dogs. The toxicity of theobromine is dose dependent. This means that the size of your pet, the type of chocolate, and quantity of chocolate determine if or how toxic it is for your pet. It's still ill advised to feed them any, as you might push them into the point of poisoning. My cited source will tell you more on that.|`|pxgLnHo8aa	only thing i want to say is don't EVER give your dogs that much chocolate, dogs aren't used to a lot of sugar and in their throat and stomach its unusually sticky, they could either choke on it or it could stay in their stomach and develop stomach cancer.|`|d2NPTtQEaa	NOT breed related!<br>  As you've PROVEN,the chocolate-poisoning-phobia is NOT as big a deal as the hysterical "chicken-littles" claim<br>  SIZE of dog & AMOUNT of which type of chocolate are the determiners..|`|KXdpjwhmaa	Some times they will die only unless it's a specific kind of chocolate and I would never give a dog chocolate only if it's a scrap dog. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be careful and Bye|`|dJvEYPRaaa	ok, short and sweet all dogs can get sick from chocolate but only if they eat more than their immune system can take, just be careful|`|AoJ7Ntu4aa	to tell u the truth any dog can die from chocolate|`|AA10461616	ALL breeds.

Do not give in. Ever.<br>  <br>  Once dogs have tasted chocolate, they want more.<br>  <br>  And for dogs, that's a bad thing.<br>  <br>  You might disagree, thinking back to a time when you noticed a dog enjoying a tidbit of chocolate with no deleterious effect.<br>  <br>  Don't be fooled.<br>  <br>  The problem, according to veterinary experts, is that eating a speck of chocolate leads a dog to crave more. It can mean that your dog will jump at a opportunity to get any type of chocolate, not knowing that certain chocolates are more lethal than other types. Larger amounts of chocolate, particularly of the most toxic type, can bring about epileptic seizures in some dogs, and in all dogs, can kill.<br>  <br>  Poisoning of dogs by chocolate is not as uncommon as you might think.<br>  <br>  "Chocolate ingestions are one common reason why pet owners and veterinarians call us," said Dana Farbman, Certified Veterinary Technician and Manager, Client and Professional Relations, ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center. "However, it would be difficult to verify an exact ranking in frequency of calls, as the types of substances we receive calls on can vary greatly depending on many factors, including the time of year. We generally do experience somewhat of a rise in chocolate calls around holidays, such as Halloween, Easter, Christmas, Valentine's Day and Mother's Day.<br>  Why is Chocolate Lethal?<br>  <br>  Chocolate contains theobromine. A naturally occurring stimulant found in the cocoa bean, theobromine increases urination and affects the central nervous system as well as heart muscle. While amounts vary by type of chocolate, it's the theobromine that is poisonous to dogs.<br>  Symptoms of Chocolate Dog Ingestion and Poisoning<br>  <br>  You can recognize that your dog has eaten a toxic dose of chocolate from the symptoms. Within the first few hours, the evidence includes vomiting, diarrhea or hyperactivity. As time passes and there's increased absorption of the toxic substance, you'll see an increase in the dog's heart rate, which can cause arrhythmia, restlessness, hyperactivity, muscle twitching, increased urination or excessive panting.<br>  <br>  This can lead to hyperthermia, muscle tremors, seizures, coma and even death.<br>  How Much Chocolate Is Deadly?<br>  <br>  If a 50-pound dog eats a teaspoonful of milk chocolate, it's not going to cause serious problems. However, if that same dog gorges himself on a two-layer chocolate cake, his stomach will feel more than upset and soon it's likely he'll be vomiting or experiencing diarrhea.<br>  <br>  To answer the question "How much is too much" is not simple. The health and age of your dog must be considered. Obviously if your dog is aged and not in top shape, his reaction to a plate of chocolate is going to be different from a young healthy dog of the same weight.<br>  <br>  Another fact that must be considered is this: Not all chocolate is the same. Some has a small amount of theobromine; another type has a large amount and still another contains an amount that is somewhere in between. The quantity has a relationship with the weight of your dog. Small dogs can be poisoned, it is easy to understand, from smaller amounts of theobromine than large dogs.<br>  <br>  Which chocolate is the safest, relatively speaking? White chocolate. It has the least amount of theobromine: 1 mg per ounce. Far on the other side of the spectrum is baking chocolate, which has a huge 450 mg of theobromine per ounce!<br>  <br>  Here are a few other chocolates for you to ponder: hot chocolate, 12 mg of theobromine per ounce; milk chocolate, 60 mg/oz; and up there near baking chocolate: semi-sweet chocolate with 260 mg/oz.<br>  <br>  You might try using this to remember these chocolates from least to most toxic: What Happy Moose Says BAA? Or: White-Hot-Milk-Semi-Baked. If you have a better way to remember, contact us!<br>  <br>  Knowing which chocolate is the most toxic is important, but leaves one wondering how much must be eaten to poison a dog. The list in this box should be helpful. Maybe you can clip it and post it on your refrigerator?<br>  <br>      * White chocolate: 200 ounces per pound of body weight. It takes 250 pounds of white chocolate to cause signs of poisoning in a 20-pound dog, 125 pounds for a 10-pound dog.<br>      * Milk chocolate: 1 ounce per pound of body weight. Approximately one pound of milk chocolate is poisonous to a 20-pound dog; one-half pound for a 10-pound dog. The average chocolate bar contains 2 to 3 ounces of milk chocolate. It would take 2-3 candy bars to poison a 10 pound dog. Semi-sweet chocolate has a similar toxic level.<br>      * Sweet cocoa: 0.3 ounces per pound of body weight. One-third of a pound of sweet cocoa is toxic to a 20-pound dog; 1/6 pound for a 10-pound dog.<br>      * Baking chocolate: 0.1 ounce per pound body weight. Two one-ounce squares of bakers' chocolate is toxic to a 20-pound dog; one ounce for

I would make sure he gets plenty of play time to wear him out.  The command "no" doesn't work well, so change it.  "No" can come up in conversation, and the puppy can think he is in trouble when he isn't.  I use different commands, sounds, and hand signals for each of my dogs.  Hang in there, he is just being a puppy, and stay firm in your training.|`|fTHE2OoQaa	<br>    yorkshire terriers tend to be bossy you know so put him in the corner for a couple of minuets you need to say no in a very stern loud voice the corner works for my dog |`|H0mtagXoaa	lol i can't stop laughing.

Make a sharp Yip sound or ow.  and stop playing & ignore him for a minute.  This is called bite inhibition.<br>  If it is truly aggressive or him trying to dominate you that is a completely different approach.  You need to make sure you establish yourself as alpha.  Do NOT hit him in any way.  Dogs do not understand this.  He is not too young to start some sort of simple obedience exercises such as sit & down.  Also, when you feed him do not let him eat until you tell him it is ok.  This will help to put you as alpha.  <br>  My little dog started the snarling and putting her teeth on me (not biting yet) when I tried to take something away from her or picked her up from sniffing something good.  I tried the pinning on the back, the holding her by the scruff of the neck.  Nothing worked until I tried holding my fingers in her mouth when she put her mouth on me.  This worked.  After 2 times she has never done it again.<br>  Every dog is different.  If you continue to have problems get help from a trainer or behaviorist.  Now is the time to correct the problem.  It will get harder as he gets older.<br>  <br>  Add:  He is not being Wicked or Naughty,  He is working out his place in the "pack".  and testing what he can get away with.   It is up to you to be the "Alpha" and teach him what is acceptable behavior..|`|tAEVMSSoaa	you should take him to a dog school...those help soo much|`|8aqoqKFCaa	You need to control him. If it takes a swat in the butt then do it. I am not saying hurt them, but something to startle them. If you don't want to do that then clap or make a noise that gets their attention and ultimately controls them. A Pssst noise over and over works with my dogs. When my dogs were puppies and were acting too agressive, I would hold them tightly to the point they couldn't move, and tell them no. I spanked them when they bit or would do something serious like that or ate cords, and they never did it again. Your pup needs to know who is in charge. The best word you can teach him is the word NO. And he needs to know your serious.   You are in charge and he needs to know it. Also, your dog may not be getting enough exercise. They need to be walked everday for, at least, an hour total. Or maybe he is teething and needs some chew toys They need to release all that energy. Some people may think that is too much, but controlling your dog may save his life.|`|rGlJ2FbUaa	It sounds like he has a very instinctive dominant personality. It would be faster and quicker to call in a behaviourist who can teach you how to be the pack leader. I see a few puppies each year who behave like this. It has nothing to do with breed. It's a personality type.<br>  Keep a leash on him so you can help him without lunging at him making him hand shy. It also stops the "keep away" game he will play if you try to get him and keeps you from getting bit.<br>  If he bites you or your clothing (which is you by his standards) go "ouch" or whatever you do to express pain. This is how bite inhibition is learned. Start with the quieter ouch and work up till he "hears" you.  If he bites you in another spot, even right beside where he just bit you, know that he is probably not disobeying but clarifying what you are saying. Dogs are literal. If I can't bite you here can I bite you there? Answer his questions till he is clear on what you are trying to teach him. <br>  Right now he has puppy teeth and jaw. You have to deal with this before he has adult teeth and power. And any behaviour you allow escalates.<br>  When he is aggressive from the tiniest growl to snapping immediately put him in a crate or a room alone for 10 minutes then quietly let him out to rejoin the pack. Do not speak to him as it may distract him from "why" he is losing the pack. He growls, you take the leash and put him away.  He will probably growl/snap again and again for a day or two.  It's a learning curve and he is also questioning if you mean it. <br>  Every time he displays any kind of aggression he loses the packs company. <br>  Take him to the pet store and try out the various bitter sprays to find the one he hates. Use it liberally on your clothes, shoes and whatever body parts he bites. Take the fun and success out of biting.<br>  It's excellent you model no violence on him. He's doing fine on his own with it. lol  I'd google NILIF: nothing in life is free.  It's a method that works well with all dogs especially strong personalities. It's a method that continually reminds a dog they are not in charge yet is is kind as there is no violence.|`|sPz028zzaa	He sounds like he is being a typical puppy and he's also beginning to find his voice.  This is an important time to let him know that he is NOT the boss EVER.  I would never hit a dog but it is useful to make a puppy who is becoming too big for his boots submit to you as you are their pack leader and are the dominant one.  Holding your puppy (firmly but not roughy) down on his side when he becomes too wild whilst talking to him in a gentle soothing way can help. Saying for example "Be calm".   <br>  When my pup started being too boisterous during play, leaping about and biting, I told him firmly 'No!' then I left the room for 30 seconds (listening to him whining on the other side of the door for me to come back always made me smile)  When i went back into the room he was always much calmer. I would start playing with him again but if he started the biting again I would repeat the process.  He soon understood that play time stopped when he bit or growled. I try only ever to give him attention for good behaviour.  When your puppy is fully vaccinated he will also gets much more exercise and so will be alot more tired.  Short,regular and fun training sessions also help to stimulate his mind and in the process use up energy.  Good luck.  Puppy obedience classes are very good as well and an excellent way to socialise your puppy.
lMYuPrhIaa	You have to keep the dog in a kennel in the cargo cabin. Or if you have a really really tiny dog, he can travel with you in the airplane, under your seat, but he has to fit in this TINY little cage thing. I would suggest putting it in the cargo area. |`|Bw18seFqaa	Call around to different airlines and find out their policies regarding pets.<br>  <br>  You didnt say the size of your dog, or if you were intending to fly her as cargo or carry on.<br>  <br>  Not all airlines allow pets as carry-on.  Many only allow so many pets in-cabin per flight.  Since holidays are busy, I highly reccommend you make these arrangements ahead of time.  She would have to be in an airline approved carrier that fits carry on standards and ride under the seat in front of you thru the entire flight.  You will also need a health certificate from your vet, and there is also a fee to fly a pet in-cabin..  around $50-100 per flight.<br>  <br>  <br>  To fly cargo...  keep in mind that many airlines will NOT fly dogs as cargo during certain weather conditions!  If this is a large dog, you may have to consider the option of boarding your dog at home instead of taking the chance that the airline may not fly her back.  She will need to be in an airline approved carrier and have a health certificate as well.  Fees to fly a dog by cargo are typically around $100-200 per flight.  You will have to check with the airline's policies regarding pets as cargo.. not all will fly pets.<br>  <br>  <br>  ADDED<br>  you will have to potty the dog before you leave, and then when you arrive.  The dog will have to hold it in the crate thru the flight.  You can limit food and water before the flight.<br>  <br>  Start getting her used to the crate now if you havent already.<br>  <br>  If your dog is flying cargo, then do NOT use a soft-sided crate!  Get a solid hard-plastic crate with the metal door and fasteners.  It will need the appropriate "live animal" stickers on it as well.|`|pImc2pCmaa	Size of your dog will be a critical factor. Most major airlines post weight requirements on the web sites. Continental is particularly good about answering questions. I, personally, would not put my dog in cargo, but lots of dogs, especially bigger ones, have to go that way. There are strict requirements about that as well. If you can bring onboard, soft-sided carriers are the best - you can get them at WalMart very inexpensively and they are airline approved. I lined mine with their blankets and a toy. No drugs - vet advised against it. There is a natural stress relief for dogs by Bach; it's called Rescue Remedy, and comes in drops. Works well. Don't feed for at least 4 hours before flight.<br>  Have fun!|`|rGlJ2FbUaa	Are you flying nationally or internationally? Double check  you have the vaccination/health certificated needed.<br>  Ensure that the few days before he the flight that you give him ample food and water to build him up. Make sure he has done both his business's just before you put him on the flight so he is emptied and comfortable. A bit of a fast is not harmful in any way for the first 24hrs.<br>  Give your dog water and food immediately upon being re-united and a walk to help him limber up.<br>  When I put an animals on a plane both the airline and I<br>  marked the crate with large written: ALIVE ANIMAL signs (top and sides) to help ensure it was put in the right cargo bay as there are both pressurized (the safe one) and unpressurized (freezing cold and no oxygen) cargo bays.<br>  Put a lock on the carrier. I'd rather have pee etc in the crate along with the dog than no dog at all. Sometimes airline personnel meaning to be kind or simply wanting to play with your animal let it out and off it goes...lost. It helps to have a carrier with a little latched opening so that water could be put in while keeping the exit door safely unavailable.<br>  Ensure your contact info and the destination are also clearly marked on the carrier and can't be accidentally removed.<br>  Ensure your dog is both micro chipped and has tag id on his collar with your contact info. Have a cushioned pad or blankets for the carrier bottom to give the dog stability and protection from the crate possibly being mishandled so he isn't bruised etc.<br>  You don't mention if your dog has a calm or a nervous personality with new experiences.<br>  If you were thinking of giving the dog a sedative of some kind make sure you try it out at home at least twice before you give it before the flight. Sedatives can actually have the opposite affect on some dogs and make them nervous and hyper. Now that would be horrible: being on a plane, confined and stoned out. So test it out first to make sure it does relax the dog and also to time how long the effects last.<br>  If at all possible do not put your dog on a plane.|`|d2NPTtQEaa	#1=CALL THE AIRLINES!!! They're the PROS!!!! ASK away-they *want* to sell you the space & will work with you<br>  <br>  Get it's health cert.w/in TEN days of the flight.<br>  Take collar & lead along so it can eliminate before putting in crate-take collar OFF.<br>  At that age,it should be crate-trained but use absorbant bedding just in case-several layers of newspaper w/SHREDDED paper on top.<br>  Do not feed & water too close in advance-full stomachs & bladders are NOT comfortable. Do NOT have water in crate-it just spills.<br>  <br>  Be SURE you know WHERE to drop off *&* pick up!!!
JM3ef0d1aa	It's necessary that you take him to the vet, especially since it has been for a few weeks. This is not good for him. Any change of behavior should be a huge signal that something is internally wrong!! Especially with a dog that age. A dog that age should still be very hyper and puppy-like.<br>  <br>  You need to have blood tests run at the vet and possibly some x-rays.

Is he eating well? Drinking normal? Has he pooped regularly? Is he vomiting or does he have diarrhea? <br>  <br>  Do not wait! Even if you have no money your vet should work with you if you discuss it with him or her. Go! Now!!!|`|nEsc9Xf4aa	Depending on where you live it could just be a change in the weather. It could also be that he isn't feeling well or may even be in pain? Take him to the vet for a check up. Even though he is young he could have joint pain or something that you wouldn't think of? Being a bigger god and a hyper dog he may have hurt himself running around?<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|JXEbWnp3aa	take him to the vets for a check up. <br>  if there is nothing wrong then get him to try out new things, like create challenges for him.|`|JLPqrhf1aa	his just doesn't know what else to do in your house he'll sleep so play with him .have some activities that both of you will enjoy<br>  and <br>  good luck|`|4keUo4Mnaa	Well it's summer so he just wants to cool off|`|2WMNawdsaa	have fun wit him :3|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	You should take him to the vet to find out what's wrong with him.  A change in his behaviour like this is a signal that something's not right.|`|iVQULHqYaa	It could be the heat, or he could have a problem. There is also a remote chance that it could be because you are feeling stressed or poorly. Dogs are very sensitive and if you are not your usual self, you dog will pick up on this. <br>  <br>  If it's possible that he is sensing a problem at home, or a change in his routine, Try to put on a big act to cheer your dog up. Get some treats out and get him to work for them, or take him on several small walks. <br>  <br>  If it's none of the above, you must take him to the vets and don't wait too long.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.

b8YNCXQsaa	I think everyone grieves in different manners and on different time lines.  I don't see a right or wrong amount of time that 1 individual experiences grief.<br>  <br>  As much as you wish you had a new baby to focus on, there is the possibility that it's not a good idea right now.  You have to ask yourself if you're looking to replace your dog, or replace the companionship.  Too often people will attempt to replace the dog resulting in resentment towards the dog for not meeting their expectations when it doesn't behave in the same manner as the previous one.  This result is unfair to both the owner and the new dog.<br>  <br>  If your looking to replace the companionship and not placing unachievable expectations on the new dog, then you can develop a new relationship that will fill the void.  I think your parents may be trying to do what is best for you and any potential new pet.  I'm sure you don't want your new baby to experience the grief of missing you while your away at college.  While at the same time, you don't want to be distracted with the grief of missing both dogs, especially during a time in your life that will be filled with so many new experiences.<br>  <br>  Ultimately this is a decision that only you and your parents can make.  I hope I've at least given you some things to consider.  I've known of people who were able to train rabbits so maybe you can venture a little in that direction to help fulfill some of the void you are feeling.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|G11IZ2HLaa	You will always love your dog, and you will always miss her, but as with life, comes death.  Concentrate on the happy times you had and cherish the memory of your dog.  You were lucky to have had a dog that opened your soul.  There will be plenty of time in your life for more dogs that will enhance your life.  Be patient.  Time will heal.|`|wO03OlIdaa	I understand how you feel.  My poodle died a few months ago from old age too.  He was almost 18 yrs old and my whole family still misses him.  We did get another poodle, except we got a standard poodle (our first one was a mini) and it really helped us get over the death of our dog.  Your parents are right, if your going to leave for the university soon than you won't be able to get close to the new dog and it will feel unloved.  After a death of a pet, it takes a while to love the new one...you seem like someone who takes time to get over someone you love.  In that case you will probably compare the new dog to your old one having a relationship just as you have with your rabbit (except the other way around) I think that you should try to spend more time with your rabbit, a rabbit and a dog have different personalities which is why you probably feel that he/she doesn't love you.  The rabbit may be expressing love differently than a dog and you are not accustomed to that.  Keep loving your rabbit and maybe in some time you will be ready to get a dog. Hope this helps you. =)|`|aHjJZWxFaa	your  going to just have to get over it like the rest of the family did if you cant get another dog. but try to let your sadness out instead of bottling it up inside of you. i know its hard to get over losing a let.|`|rGlJ2FbUaa	Every tear you shed honours the memory of your beloved and the time you shared. Maybe some of your family members are hiding their grief to not make it worse for you or simply didn't have the bond you two had. Everybody handles grief in their own way. Allow yourself to grieve your own way. I send you Hugs and Love. Be Gentle with yourself.<br>  It's so hard when you lose your best friend. I know how you feel. <br>  I am still devastated by the loss of my beloved so I do rescue and volunteer work with animals in her honour.  There is nothing you can do except cherish that you two were together.  The pain of loss is the flip side of love and we can't have one without the other.<br>  You will develop your own special relationship with your rabbit as unique and special as you had with your dog and yes it will be different.<br>  Crystal Ward Kent ([partial of "The Journey)<br>  You will learn the true measure of love - the steadfast, undying kind that says, "It doesn't matter where we are or what we do, or how life treats us as long as we are together." Respect this always. It is the most precious gift any living soul can give another. You will not find it often among the human race. <br>  <br>  And you will learn humility. The look in my dog's eyes often made me feel ashamed. Such joy and love at my presence. She saw not some flawed human who could be cross and stubborn, moody or rude, but only her wonderful companion. Or maybe she saw those things and dismissed them as mere human foibles, not worth considering, and so chose to love me anyway. <br>  <br>  If you pay attention and learn well, when the journey is done, you will be not just a better person, but the person your pet always knew you to be - the one they were proud to call beloved friend. <br>  <br>  I must caution you that this journey is not without pain. Like all paths of true love, the pain is part of loving. For as surely as the sun sets, one day your dear animal companion will follow a trail you cannot yet go down. <br>  <br>  And you will have to find the strength and love to let them go. A pet's time on earth is far too short - especially for those that love them. <br>  <br>  We borrow them, really, just for awhile, and during these brief years they are generous enough to give us all their love, every inch of their spirit and heart, until one day there is nothing left. <br>  <br>  The cat that only yesterday was a kitten is all too soon old and frail and sleeping in the sun. The young pup of boundless energy wakes up stiff and lame, the muzzle now gray. Deep down we somehow always knew that this journey would end. We knew that if we gave our hearts they would be broken. <br>  <br>  But give them we must for it is all they ask in return. When the time comes, and the road curves ahead to a place we cannot see, we give one final gift and let them run on ahead - young and whole once more. <br>  <br>  "Godspeed, good friend," we say, until our journey comes full circle and our paths cross again.<br>  _________________<br>  <br>  
rGlJ2FbUaa	Sure she whines. Her life changed suddenly when she "lost" her mom and litter mates, she's a baby and now she has you who she doesn't want to disappear. It's good to help her learn to be alone comfortably as it's a life skill she will have to have.<br>  First off: when you go, just leave. No fuss, petting, talking. You think you are reassuring her but from her point of view you are demonstrating worry and concern. She interprets this as you going off into danger. This is how separation anxiety is created.<br>  Same thing when you return. As hard as it is: ignore her for a few minutes when you return. She may be jumping, frantic, for your attention because, whew, you returned safely from the "danger". Humans tend to perceive this reunion as joy but often it is relieved stress the human came home safely.  By ignoring her till she calms down a bit you are telling her there was no problem. You still get to have a great love-up but after a minute or two.<br>  You have a human perspective. She has a dogs.<br>  Practice leaving. Pick up keys, put on shoes whatever and while totally ignoring her step outside for a minute then still ignoring her, come back in and go about your business.  This demonstrates that your leaving is not a big deal. Do it as much as possible in a day: 10 times or more. It only takes a minute or two each time.<br>  Do not pay any attention when she whines etc or she will be training you to respond and her whining will increase because it works. She will do whatever behaviour gets the response she wants. If she realizes that whining doesn't work, she will stop whining. She's not stupid.  Ignoring (as long as no danger is involved) is a terrific method for eliminating unwanted behaviour.<br>  It is a good idea to confine her to a crate or one room at this age. It can be comforting. Allow her to earn the right to total freedom.|`|Tkzmq39Iaa	shes going to have to get over it at some point, it is really hard when they miss you try leaving the radio or tv on so she has some noise around, she'll eventually become more independant and now that you will come backsoon. maybe even give her one of those bones you get from the pet shop my dogs love them that will keep her buisy|`|sVv0XnlNaa	try taking her to a kennal, or just give her things to do during to time your gone! :)<br>  <br>  how long are you gone a day? <br>  a pup has to be fed 3 times a day till its about 6 months old, and you also have to take it out regularly for potty training.|`|qBD73vGzaa	This is norma, she will calm down.<br>  <br>  If you have time, take her on a walk before you leave, this will drain some of that puppy energy.|`|4EwCcYP2aa	She will calm down.

She should have a blanket, food, water, toys, and bones in her crate.  She may whine at first, but should settle down.  |`|H0mtagXoaa	Kennel!! I think it is important to kennel train your pup. It helps with the separation anxiety. It will also help with potty training.  |`|oChOlCqYaa	Separation anxiety is a common problem. 1st of all try crate training her. Get her used to the crate by giving her treats for going in with the door open, then with it closed for a minute, then longer. Second, try a "bye-bye bone" this can be any safe treat or toy she only gets when you leave, but it should be something of high value. One thing that works well is a kong toy filled with peanut butter, cream cheese, yogurt, and/or dog treats and frozen. Third, be sure you leave calmly. Take her outside to potty and then tell her goodbye about 1/2 hour before you plan to leave and then calmly go about your business and try not to interact with her. You may put her in the crate about 1/2 hour before you leave as well. <br>  |`|uGFzzLYWaa	I hope you're not giving your dog free reign of the house, she definitely should NOT be trusted in the home alone at that age, unless you want to go home to a trashed house and pee and poop all over the place.<br>  I suggest crate training.

zakbXGK6aa	I don't know.  Isn't that used for farm animals?  It may not be the best thing for baby birds.  Don't forget that farmers plan on eating their animals, so the health of the animals isn't that important to them (at lest not in a long-term sort of way).  PETCO carries a compressed paper product used for baby bird bedding.  You might want to check there.
mT28ruiuaa	There are types of hamster/gerbil bedding you can use. I have horses, and we use the pellet bedding it is pretty dusty if not watered down ALOT.

OjXAcwJPaa	Im not entirely pleased with a few answers. If you brought him in, use a cardboard box & tear some newspapers to shreds, for litter, till you buy some. young cat + 8 blocks = streets to me. cats & cars are not a good combo. Make some fliers hang up near where you found him(he  probably was not far from where he should have been), maybe hes lost. <br>  food. tuna & water ok, till you buy some cat food, if youre going to try to find his home , find him a home, or keep him. If he followed you & is friendly, he may already have a home & the safest way to get him home is the fliers(so he doesnt go in the street). If theres an animal shelter or a vet nearby, ask if they can scan for a microchip. Good luck.|`|e2d2edc925921dd1cdc604617c876c32aa	Call your local animal shelter and ask their advice. They can pick the cat up for you or recommend how to find if it has an owner.<br>  <br>  You may wish to take it to the vet to see if it's been microchipped - the vet would scan the cat and it hs been microchipped would be able to find the name and address of it's owners.<br>  <br>  Tuna and water is fine but can depend on the age. One of my 9 month kittens can't eat anything but the brand of kitten food he's used to without being sick. However other cats are usually easier.<br>  <br>  He needs a litter tray just in case he need to go to the bathroom. You can buy one at a pet shop or even a big supermarket for a couple of quid plus a couple of quid for litter. If you don't want to leave him get a cardboard box (about twice as wide as the cat) or even an old basin and fill it will pebbles or shredded up newspaper. Set the cat in it and lift his paw and scrape it through the newspaper/pebbles. Hopefully he will catch on. Just in case keep him in a room with no carpet such as the bathroom or kitchen.<br>  <br>  Are you sure he's a stray? There is a good chance if he looks healthy enough that he has a home of his own and just likes to wander. In which case if you let him out he might go home and if not his owner may be worried. Best to let an animal shelter know where he is as if he has an owner they may ring there as well.|`|7JQLWqA0aa	Put a notice in your local shop, if you can take a photograph of him and include it on the photo, if you have a local paper they will often have a lost and found section and the found is usually free to put a notice in. Try your best to trace the owner first, sometimes though they do not want to be found so you can then claim the cat but it is best to get it neutred or spayed and get all the vaccinations up to date, If you don't want that responsibility then it is best to take it to a local animal shelter.|`|wLHMhhVxaa	if u just put him outside it be better cause u wont get attched to it cause if its survived all that time as a stray it should be able to find for its self my opinion so doo what you want|`|HTcmY4I2aa	yeah thats fine. have you got a fenced in garden?<br>  <br>  erm, look around for flyers and posters that mgith have : HAVE YOU SEEN THIS KITTEN?<br>  <br>  or if you cant, take it to the animal centre.

Then you can consider what you will stock in it. <a href="http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cycling.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldcichlids.com/faqs/cyclin...</a><br>  <br>  With a good sized tank like a 55 gallon, you really open the doors to a greater diversity of fish that you can stock in it. You can get the tetras like your husband would like and still have larger fish, just check compatibility. Rams, kribensis, and keyholes are all peaceful cichlids (a nice size each) that can be housed in a 55 gallon. Be sure not to overstock your tank though.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FCgQOj0Maa	hi<br>  since the aquarium is fairly new you might want to start with mollies so that you can cycle the tank.<br>  mollies are one of the hardiest fish to survive new aquarium thats not cycled yet.<br>  buy like six mollies and let the tank cycle for 6 weeks.dont buy anymore fish just yet. after six weeks  of feeding them and enjoying your fish<br>  then you could bring the mollies back(if its a family run fish store)and get your neons and gouramis.tiger barbs are a little more aggressive and could harm the neons,cherry barbs  are far more passive than there more aggresive relatives(tiger barb).and every few weeks you could add a few fish at a time. just so you dont  get an ammonium spike|`|EEAV2hYtaa	I like small species that are cute and don't die easily.  Green spotted puffer, red-claw crabs, axolotl, and eels.|`|efRdH6vwaa	i have a 55 tank myself and got pacu's it's pretty big fish .  I always get a peco or other bottom feeder.  I also love the dragon fish the light blue color and get really long.  If your wanting something hard to kill gold fish or mollys. Mollys are great because of number of colors you can buy. also live plants are wonderful addtion. Mystery snails always look neat.  even if you cycle your aquaium i reccomend a water conditioner to help keep ph and kh in balance especially if you want multiple fish.<br>  my suggestion<br>  <br>  1. Plant: amazon sword grows nicely<br>  2. pelcosumus pelco or bottom feeder<br>  3. Mollys Dalmation or black or reds.<br>  4. get community fish your pet store can help you with additional fish which can go with gouramis or mollys  <br>   do not add to many fish till you know what you like. Let me know any questions as i've had tanks for several years.
smaYepFVaa	si il n'est pas encore sevré tu peux aller en pharmacie acheté du lait en poudre pour chaton (c'est comme pour les bébés), tu as le petit biberon avec. ?a marchera peut-être car a cet age là ils ont besoin de bien se nourrir.<br>  bon courage pour le petit caramel|`|6IbUKr5kaa	pourquoi du fromage !!!!!<br>  |`|kuJet9xuaa	essayer le véto , pour être vraiment être sure qu'il na rien|`|C8hZ2N2Vaa	Que ton Caramel ne mange pas beaucoup les deux premiers jours c'est normal. C'est le stress du changement qui en est la cause. Il lui faudra un peu de temps pour se faire à sa nouvelle maison. Par contre ses vomissements ne sont pas normaux. <br>  Va-t-il à la selle normalement ? Cela se peut qu'il est un bouchon de poils dans l'estomac. Pour cela, je pense qu'il vaille mieux aller voir un vétérinaire. Essayer de lui donner un peu de paté pour chaton cela ramollit les selles. Mais si demain après-midi il vomit toujours prenez rendez-vous chez un véto, lui seul pourra vous faire un bon diagnostique.<br>  N'attendez pas car plus vous attendrez, plus se sera dure de le soigner et plus cela vous co?tera de l'argent.<br>  <br>  Sinon en tant normal, la nourriture principale d'un chat étant les croquettes (de bonnes qualités : Hill's, Iam's, Purina Pro Plan), le reste (paté, thon, fromage blanc) ne sera que gourmandise à donner de temps en temps.<br>  <br>  bonne chance et pleins de caresses au nouveau venu ;)|`|sif2ybdQaa	Alors déjà si il n'est pas sevré comment tu as pu l'adopter, il a besoin de lait, et pas de fromage, car la vache kiri est mauvaise pour eux, il y a des ferments qui font travaillé son estomac, tu dois prendre du lait spécial chaton, la a part lui abimé l'estomac, ton véto pourra donné un platrage, mais te posera la meme question, comment a tu fais pour adopter un chat non sevré!!|`|OVJjNYgIaa	Si il ne mange pas, pas de caca possible, si il bois, il peut faire pipi. <br>  Rien de plus normal.

Laisse le tranquille la journée et s'il ne va pas mieux demain, il faudra quand même te résoudre a faire appel au veto même s'il est loin.|`|xvCHq2Ldaa	Bonsoir !<br>  <br>  Je pense que vous n'éviterez pas le vétérinaire...car les vomissements de votre chat sont anormaux, c'est certains.<br>  <br>  Voici quelques maladies que pourrait avoir votre chat :<br>  <br>  Les obstructions intestinales :<br>  Si votre chat vomit plus fréquemment que d’habitude, s’il recrache du sang coagulé ou s’il perd du poids, il peut souffrir d’une obstruction intestinale ou d’une tumeur. Consultez alors immédiatement un vétérinaire. <br>  <br>  Les gastrites :<br>  Plusieurs formes de gastrite peuvent engendrer des crises de vomissements aigu?s. Gardez le chat à la maison et donnez-lui de petites quantités d’eau. S’il vomit l’eau, restreignez les prises de liquide pendant huit à douze heures pour permettre à l’estomac de se reposer. Donnez alors une cuillerée à soupe d’eau toutes les trente minutes afin d’éviter la déshydratation et supprimez toute nourriture pendant les huit heures qui suivent la dernière attaque. Reprenez alors l’alimentation par petites quantités. Si le chat continue à vomir, consultez rapidement un vétérinaire. <br>  <br>  Ingestion d’objet :<br>  Des vomissements peuvent également survenir après l’ingestion d’un petit objet provoquant un blocage de l’intestin. Radiographies, endoscopie, voire chirurgie, peuvent être prescrits pour localiser et retirer l’objet. Ce problème est toutefois moins fréquent chez les chats que chez les chiens. Il peut arriver au chat de régurgiter sa nourriture avant même qu'elle ait atteint l’estomac et éventuellement de l’ingérer à nouveau. Ce phénomène occasionnel et bénin peut se produire lorsque le chat mange trop vite. Cependant, s’il persiste, demandez conseil à votre vétérinaire.<br>  <br>  L’entérite infectieuse :<br>  Les chats et chatons non vaccinés sont exposés à l’entérite infectieuse. Dans les formes les plus aigu?s de la maladie, le chat souffre de crises de vomissements graves et fréquentes, de diarrhée et de douleurs abdominales. L’entérite infectieuse est souvent fatale. Elle est aussi très contagieuse. La meilleure prévention reste la vaccination mais, malheureusement, celle-ci n’est pas efficace contre toutes les formes de la maladie.<br>  <br>  Vous pouvez contacter un vétérinaire sans être obligé d'y aller, il peu vous donner des conseils par téléphone.<br>  <br>  Bon courage !<br>  Camimouille|`|NAMjLgWAaa	pk tu a pris un chaton alor kil n'est pas sevré??!!! faut pas faire sa sil nest pas sevré c kil a encore besoin du lait de sa mere pr grandir!!!!! si il est malade te plain pas!!<br>  ensuite on ne donne pas a manger du fromage a un chaton encore moins sil nest pas sevré, et on ne donepas a manger a un animal ki vomi!!<br>  tu di ke tu ne peu pas sortir de chez oi, mai tu dispose dinternet et dun telefone dc kest ski tempeche de telefoner a ton veto pr avoir d conseil et savoir koi faire??!!<br>  tu croi ke les gen sur Q/R sont d veto??|`|f0facaea14837feb8e70be33f8828438aa	il semble avoir une gastro-entérite, regarde si son ventre semble ballonné ou distendu, c'est très courant et assez contagieux pour les autres animaux ont le trouve souvent chez les chatons ou chiots d'animalerie ou des refuges.mon conseille: ne lui donne rien à manger, de l'eau à volonté et le véto demain s'il vomi encore beaucoup.|`|EdnPcgOxaa	si tu aimes ton chaton, ne lui donnes pas du fromage (trop gras) et donnes lui de la bonne nourriture que tu peux acheter dans une animalerie (croquette et/ ou sachet) de SCIENCE PLAN ou PRO PLAN<br>  <br>  Ce n'est pas bon qu'il vomisse comme ?a, il est entrain de se déshydrater et je pense que tu devrais faire l'effort de l'emmener chez un vétérinaire car il risque de mourrir si il se vide trop|`|nXHm5k5Yaa	pas de fromage !!!!!<br>  Sinon du lait pour chat acheté en grande surface rayon animalerie et des aliments spécial chaton.<br>  <br>  |`|ib4Bp2S5aa	c'est un chat laisse le tranquille il va s'en remettre et dis moi qui t'as dis de lui donner du fromage ... c'est pas pour ses proies les souris ?à ?|`|xC3BJHW9aa	La maman est où ?<br>  Il est jeune ?<br>  ...et oubli le fromage...<br>  Il stress c'est nouveau pour lui...laisse le se reposer un peu...|`|LdG06sUGaa	du fromage pour un chat n'importe quoi sur cette rubrique

GixpuxR8aa	I'm sorry to say if he is sluggish and he is older than 20 (cockatiels aren't meant to live much longer than 15 years!)  then your poor bird might not be long for this world. I'm sorry to say, but that's what happened to my bird and my friends birds. They were fine one day and not so great the next. I hope i'm wrong, and as other people are saying, it's just mites, but please take it to the vet! <br>  <br>  I hope it works out.|`|XqOnOHSGaa	i would take him to the vet if he is scarting there maybe some kind of bug or flee or somthing causing this.

Could be his life cycle is almost to an end. Sad but we all get old and our bodies break down and wear out. If you can't afford a Avian Vet call one and see if they can tell you what to do. I have 6 Cockatiels, Bronze Wing Pionus, and a Sparrow. I had bought some food that wasn't good and all our birds had gotten ill. I called the vet and told them what was going on and since it was just too much stress for my birds I couldn't take them all in, so he treated them as an out patient and supplied me for the medicine I needed. They all pulled through just fine. I wasn't charged an office visit and he wrote it up as an out patient therefore was only charged for medication. It won't hurt to call and see if there is one in your area that would do that. Or they will advise you the best way to treat your bird.<br>  However if your bird is that old I would do what I could medically then keep giving him as much love and attention as I could. But do try something. Maybe it's just mites however if your bird has never had them before and you have owned him for 20 years then chances are he doesn't have them now. Just call a vet it won't hurt to be safe in any case. Good Luck. It's so sad when we lose what we love. These birds are so close to our hearts.
rGlJ2FbUaa	If I understand this right Alfie is not a puppy but a dog you have adopted so you do not know his past history or experiences. He may have had some kind of trauma or it could be medical. I've had over 5000 dogs thru my hands doing rescue and yes dogs dream. And have had dogs doing what you described who got over it with responsible care.<br>  First off keep him and everyone safe. It's good he sleeps on his own in another room. When he awakes do not make a fuss by petting or cuddling him. Folk do this thinking they are reassuring an animal but we tend to only pat/cuddle when we approve of their behaviour so do not touch or talk to him. Give him a few minutes or whatever time is necessary till you see he is himself again then calmly interact with him.<br>  It does sound like he could be confused when  he wakes up as to what happened as waking is a different reality than when he was sleeping. Or he is recovering from pain. That is why I suggested leaving him alone for a while when he awakes till he sorts himself out.  He knows best when he has "come to terms" so to speak and then you can't be inadvertently making it worse.  He may be avoiding everyone when he wakes because he hurts. <br>  Being with someone as kind and caring as you makes him one lucky dog!<br>  Give him plenty of physical exercise. It is one of the best antidotes for stress there is and will help him have healthy sleeps. Mental exercise helps too so maybe teach him some tricks or obedience etc.<br>  I'd find another vet. That is so insensitive and irresponsible to say a dog has to behave a certain way on a deadline or else. <br>  It would be good to rule out there isn't a medical problem of any kind. Certain injuries or illnesses can cause aggression and can manifest in seemingly odd ways. What if he experiences some kind of pain when he lays down? That may also explain why he dreads going to sleep.   <br>  If he checks out healthy you need  a behaviorist. And Time.You've only had him one month. As long as everyone is safe, give him some time to settle in and hopefully heal. <br>   <br>  I'd really appreciate knowing how this goes. If it is a health or behaviour issue.You sound like a great caring dog guardian. All the Best...|`|FUmjD9b3aa	Does the dog bite people when he is having one of these 'nightmares'?  I guess if he is sleeping and dreaming, I don't understand the Vet suggesting you put the dog down?  Is he harming people, other dogs, himself?   <br>  <br>  I have to also question your Vet "giving you one month to make the dog better".  YOU pay a Vet to make your dog better, you do not pay a Vet to basically threaten you with making your own dog better or it should be put down.   <br>  <br>  I think we are missing information here.  I also think you may need to get a new Vet.|`|GMOYdjyKaa	If the aggressiveness only happens when he's asleep, than why not just leave him alone. Dogs DO dream and it's possible he has bad dreams.

I have two dogs and both of them make sounds and twitch when they are asleep.  Maybe this is an extreme case of dreaming?

Don't put them in the same tank or they will fight with one another and be stressed.  They don't need big tanks at all, most people put them in bowls or tanks smaller than 1 gallon.  I hope this helps you! 
f0egZ7Sdaa	If they are playing, and tails are wagging, then you shouldn't worry. But the other owner has every right to have her dog not play with your dog. (I would allow my dog to play with yours... as they are just playing)<br>  <br>  Our 15lb BT plays with our neighbors 90lb Boxer who growls. This is where our BT learned to growl while playing. Not once have we ever felt concern for our BT's safety.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I correct any behavior that bothers me.  I don't care what other people's dogs do, my dogs are not allowed to act like that.  I point at the dog that is in trouble, and correct that behavior.  You have to teach your dogs what behaviors you allow and which ones you don't.  |`|E5gaKzCsaa	Growling can often be play growling. My dogs do it all the time. I growl at them when we play! Watch the body language for other clues. Growling with hair raised and legs stiff, for instance, is more serious. It will take a little time to learn when or if your dog means something other than play when he growls, but he sounds like a very well adjusted and sociable guy. As he gets older he may get a little more assertive, so watch for that and discourage it if he seems to be getting more serious with the growling, but it doesn't sound to me as if you'll have much to worry about in that department.  One of my dogs has a buddy and when they get together, they run parallel to each other at full speed, snapping and growling with teeth bared, like a pair of wolves. It's play to them. I've had dogs who chew on each other's necks for play. <br>  <br>  I think the other dog owner was paranoid and over-reacted. There are people like that. They don't really understand dogs and interpret dog behaviour in human terms. They often think dogs are being vicious when they're playing, not understanding that wrestling and chasing is what dogs do. I wonder sometimes how they think dogs should play--sit down and play with Lego together? I don't think their dogs get to have much fun. When you encounter one of those people, just take your dog away and find someone else for him to play with. |`|A21SswSfaa	Play growling is something a lot of dogs do. If he's not showing any other signs of aggressive behavior, it's perfectly fine. Sounds like the other dog owner over-reacted. I let my dogs play growl, I know they don't mean it and it's just their way of having fun.|`|ba8dd4c6a9b532bef579aff3e8706fe7aa	It's normal.  That's how dogs play.|`|ml76J5F7aa	Its normal, and thats how dogs talk to each other, or one way of showing dominance, vocally. I used to have a 70lb pitbull, totally submissive and wouldnt hurt a fly even if I told him to. Some pet owners would let their 10lb dogs play with him (which usually meant him standing there while the little dog yapped at his tummy or ears), and some pet owners would pick up their dogs so they wouldnt have to walk past him. It all depends on the pet owners, so dont mind the ones who overreact. Just nod and walk away. No need to correct, Im sure your dog will make plenty of other dog friends!!|`|6rCjXItVaa	Completely normal!  My two dogs are sooo loud!  Just keep an eye on them and watch their body signals to ensure that all is fun and games!|`|kkM4ZdVIaa	It should be ok I mean if he is playing why cant her growl He is not the type of dog that will turn on you so I think it should be fine|`|rGlJ2FbUaa	Besides body, tail and eye movements dogs communicate with growls from tiny ones to louder. The only time you have to worry is a full teeth to gums showing snarl- then it's serious.<br>  You said yourself the other dogs don't mind. They understand what he is communicating and that is what matters. He has the right to set boundaries just like the other dogs do. At 11 months he is a teenager and growing up.<br>  It sounds like you've done a fine job socializing him with other dogs so he can speak and understand. You said it yourself: he can keep himself safe. Interfering and stopping his communicating could cause problems. It's like butting in on someone's conversation when you don't know whats going on in the first place.<br>  Don't worry about the lady who didn't understand. Some people who really don't know a lot about dogs see any level of growling as dangerous when most of it is simply communication.
JjF5qlyHaa	Muslims do not allow dogs indoors and I don't think they keep them as pets, either. They believe that dogs are very unclean. Cats are fine, however. Our friend and her husband (who is Muslim) went to visit his family in India, and they went out looking for a cat for his sister. She loves the little darling :)|`|mzbiB39zaa	i dont think Muslims do bt im not sure|`|psmTrwT3aa	islam its mean to be unhygenic i think.. muslims are big on hygene. and its dogs i dont think its cats|`|OGbxnRkjaa	I know this sounds outrageous but I dated an African (black) muslim who broke up with me because he came to my house and my pet dog at the time licked my face.

Evidently muslims are really serious about these matters.  <br>  <br>  My friends to this day never leave it down...I'm reminded of this embarrassment quite frequently.

rGlJ2FbUaa	Wow can I relate to you. I've had to take dogs like this from their owners and do boot camps to fix this problem because for various reasons they couldn't.  Food and praise has nothing to do with this lesson in any shape or form. This could be why the problem has not gone away. <br>  First off: Keep your sense of humour and patience.<br>  (I know it's very tough by now!  And it's really rough when it's a high pitched cry as it grates. I sympathize.)<br>  Exercise both mental and physical is excellent.<br>  One question is why you say "during the day she wails from her crate"? How long and why is she kept in a crate during the day?<br>  <br>  Second: You "have" to ignore her. Period.  Any behaviour you ignore goes away. Remember how you behave when you are totally ignored? You give up as it doesn't get the result you wanted. This means no eye contact, no speaking to her, Nothing, as that is like teasing her. If she sees she has your attention in any way at all she will wail louder and longer as she thinks her methods are starting to work on you so if she just tries harder..... 'nuff said?<br>  If you have to put a towel/blanket on the crate so she can't see you and the stimulus is reduced.<br>  She must "cease to exist" when she wails, cries, whimpers. <br>  She "must" be totally quiet for 10 whole minutes before she comes out. That means even one tiny whimper:  the clock restarts. You'll have noticed she carries on for a while and then goes silent for a bit then just as you're thinking blessed silence (not 10 minutes I assure you, lol) has come...she starts up again.<br>  This is normal. She tried wailing. hmm that didn't work. She silences while she thinks about it and now tries howling. When that doesn't work she tries whimpering. When that doesn't work she scrabbles at the crate door and barks. She is running through a repertoire to try and get the result she want. Let her. You have no choice.<br>  If you've looked at her or spoken to her (reprimanding her?) given her "any" kind of attention you've inadvertently added to the problem. Even giving her heck is attention! Not what she wanted but it's attention!<br>  You can put a toy, chew toy whatever with her.<br>  Make sure you continue your life normally. Walk around, sit down while totally ignoring her. Often as you seem to be coming near her crate she quiets as she thinks you are finally obeying her. This is why you have to wait 10 minutes. Walk in and out of the room she is in many times to help her learn this.   Pass on by the crate as she doesn't exist right? Help her learn clearly and as quick as possible that any kind of fussing doesn't work in any way.<br>  <br>  I repeat: you must have 10 minutes of silence before she gets out of the crate or any attention. When you let her out do not make a fuss. <br>  Be calm and kindly neutral.<br>  <br>  I've done this techniques with literally hundreds of dogs of every age and it usually works within 24 to 48 hours. Only once did it take 3 days with a 2 yr old dog whose owners had treated the dog when it carried on so it had inadvertently been rewarded/trained to carry on. And they had looked at him and talked to him while he was crated so the behaviour had been very re-inforced by them. And he was a most stubborn dog, lol. But he learned and became a calm companion.<br>  <br>  It sounds like she has or is on the way to separation anxiety. Whenever you come and go from the home (or a room) simply leave. No fuss, no talking or petting. Tell her your coming and going is normal and no danger involved. Tell her that by not making any issue of it. Dogs perceive a fuss made on them not as parting guilt but as you saying you are worried and going into danger. And the exuberant reunion as your relief at making it home safely. Safety of the pack is paramount so if you are "in danger" the dog will stress. When you come home, walk in, go about your business totally ignoring the dog for a few minutes till it calms down. Then have the love-up.<br>  Look at how the dog will perceive it versus what you mean by it.<br>  With you in spirit....<br>  <br>  |`|WiycCxpzaa	Try moving the crate into your bedroom with you. More than likely the pup feels alone and therefor whines and whines and whines because I can only guess at some point you give in?<br>  <br>  Moving the crate in your bedroom will help her to feel comfortable knowing someone is there with her. Also leave the crate door open during the day.. let her wander in and out of it to get used to it a bit more.|`|7uwzZjuZaa	can you move her to an area farther away from you, like in the garage or something?  I realize if you live in an appartment it would be hard to do.  Or can you buy a cheap box fan to try and help cover the noise at night?  Ear plugs?  |`|S5Lz35myaa	The cries will stop - but it does take a little time.<br>  You don't mention age, but you do say "puppy", so I'm assuming she's rather young.<br>  Toys are great, but also make sure her crate has a stuffed toy, without clothes or add ons that she could chew.  But something soft and furry.  Also, wear an old shirt or pair of pants that you don't really care about.  Then, without washing it, put that in the crate with her.  Your scent, and something soft and warm to snuggle with, will help.|`|774b96759f37e4c3d133064bb8b43db9aa	I hate to say this, but it's going to take a lot of patience and stamina on your part to help train this out of her. With puppies, it's VERY important to start training on day one, and have endless amounts of patience and energy to spare when training them. Once you put her in her crate, walk out of the room. here's the sucky part: yes. She will cry. You need to ignore it. Eventually she will learn that noisemaking, is not what will bring you to her. The moment she stops crying, go over to her, and give her a treat, and praise her lavishly. yes, it is going to be very trying, but it will work out in the long run, just be patient, and kind with her:)|`|g2KhN4rzaa	She is just now getting use to u and her environment. It probably frightens her when she notices that u are not around. Keep her bed/crate near u and put something that may have ur scent in her bed to comfort her when ur not around.|`|T7nsmFAZaa	Place her crate in your room at night.  We ended up just buying a second crate for upstairs, just so we didn't have to lug it up and down the stairs every day.  Our Doberman puppy is 13 weeks old, and she sleeps just fine in her crate at night.  But then, she can hear and smell us in the room with her, and that makes her feel comforted.  If we were to put her in her downstairs crate at bedtime, she would cry and howl.<br>  <br>  She's only been with you for three days, so try to remember that she is adjusting to her new home, family, and surroundings.  Try to make her as comfortable as possible while still maintaining boundaries with her.  When you leave the house during the day, put some soft music on for her to comfort her while she is in her crate and home alone.
OmRxIg8Baa	I would use an empty soda bottle filled with 3-4 pennies and use it as a sound aversion technique whenever you do get a chance to catch your dog in the act of getting into garbage and pulling towels to get to human food.  I own 2 large breed dogs and they HATE this noise and will stop whatever they are doing.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you are on the right track.<br>  <br>  I feed my dogs in the morning and in the evenings, if they do not finish their food in 10-15 minutes i remove the dog dishes with the leftover food.  Just to entice your dog to eat, for a few days of the week- put some chicken (unseasoned) & pumpkin in with the dog food you plan on feeding your dog, sometimes i even will hide treats at the bottom of the food bowl to get my dogs to clean their bowls.<br>  <br>  Hunger always wins out...and constant survillence of your counters and trash at least for a few weeks, to make sure that you shake the penny bottle will get the message across that your dog is not welcome to eat human food.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|FU5sZqVVaa	I guess he will.|`|LolctYwBaa	Does he have plenty of chew toys? A firm "NO!" when he gets into something, is the way I trained my dog. Bye the time he was 2., he never got into anything again. Your dog is a bit older, but can still train him.|`|rGlJ2FbUaa	Once an animal has been successful (and that's the key word here) at a behaviour they can be most persistent at being successful again.<br>  You've done all the right things. Prevention, a feeding schedule (at least twice a day is good for a dog like this) and working on training your children. Good for you.<br>  You could try a "leave it" command. The problem with this is he'll probably behave when you are around but when you aren't there...<br>  How about trying to take the fun out of it. Take him to the pet supply store to find the "nasty" taste spray that works best on him.  What one dog hates another is ok with so take him with you to sample them. Choose some non breakable plates etc for this setup. Spray the nasty stuff on these plates, the garbage lid, everything he goes to and tries for the garbage or food sources. You could set-up the towel on the counter with the plate on it. All of it liberally nasty sprayed including the food you will use for this set-up.  Don't let him see you preparing all this and allow 10 minutes for the vapors from the nasty spray to settle. Then let him go for it.  When he "succeeds" it won't be the satisfying fun it was. Enough repetition of it now being unsatisfying he may well give it up. <br>  <br>  He will eat his dog food. Nothing wrong with his waiting and hoping for what he's learned to prefer. If he fasts for a day or two it won't hurt him and he will eat when he is hungry. I had a dog like this once. She'd refuse to eat all day long and finally about 10pm at night would give a huge sigh and go eat. The first time it was 2 days, then the 10pm eating and after a couple of weeks she simply ate when offered food.<br>  She'd still try for the garbage can if she could.<br>  I am sorry to tell you it very well "may" be a life long problem as he has learned something fun and rewarding but you never know.He could change. Time will tell. It could be worse. He could be eating the furniture, clothing, poo etc.
bDPVRtCNaa	It's difficult to tell for sure when they are very small. But eventually the differences should be noticeable; it's all to do with bumps and pores.

rGlJ2FbUaa	I am so sorry for your experience and very glad you returned the puppy if you couldn't call in a professional behaviouralist.<br>  It has nothing to do with breed. Though that mix probably didn't help the situation.  It has to do with personality type. You say you have children. Same parents, environment but each child is different right?  Same with puppies.  You got the instinctively dominant one. The puppy was already trying to control you as it wanted to be pack leader. These types act more like dogs than puppies!  Your puppy probably had what we call "hard" eyes and seemed angry unless it was getting its own way.<br>  I've see this personality several times a year and it can be fixed. I've had 100% success and it requires never modeling violence, clear leadership, consistency and consequences.<br>  In your case it was better to be safe.  |`|Qe04KxYoaa	You got him from a BYB no wonder he was not socialized properly. How long did you have him? How old was he when you got him? Have you ever had other dogs?

And I have owned many cats.  60% of dogs are territorial and really not fit to be around children and that's what people just do NOT want to see.<br>  <br>  I heard Rottweilers and Pit-Bulls are dogs with the instinct to bite when they just feel something is not right.  It is all normal.  The puppy bit you guys, but its only a matter of time he will bite your children.

My first suggestion is to get the puppy enrolled in obedience class with a good trainer who has experience with similar breeds.<br>  <br>  The other thing you don't mention is how much cardio exercise you are giving the dog. It sounds like he has a LOT of energy to burn. Make sure you are letting him have a good run everyday and possibly several times per day so that he can drain off the excess energy. A basic walk will not drain off the energy. He needs to run!|`|gwUMipsUaa	"Luckily he never did anything to are children but not to risk anything we did turn the puppy back.

This is a nine week old puppy who should have stayed with his mother for another week or so. A nine week old puppy cannot be vicious. With proper handling he would have calmed down.

Puppies are playful and like to go at people by nipping your feet/legs clothing etc and growl while doing it. It's just play. Attacking would be ripping your arms or other parts of body to shreds drawing blood and not letting go of the target baring of the teeth, tail tucked under the legs with hair standing up, with the puppies ears back or down sideways. It bugs me that people do not understand the body language of dogs. Playful manner is a dogs ears are up and alert, if they are floppy ears the skin between them on the forehead would be wringled, tail wagging, with nipping, and growling. Before getting a puppy it's best to know the breed and be sure you can handle having a puppy while understanding all behaviors of dogs.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	Oh jesus tap dancing christ.<br>  <br>  Your neighbors could NOT be more incorrect! You NEVER take an aggressive dog or puppy and flip it over onto its back, that can panic it and cause it to act out in a more aggressive manner than before.<br>  <br>  Your neighbor is the LAST person you want to be talking to about this- mainly because they are horrible back yard breeders. They sold you a puppy who's parents didn't have testing done to prove that they aren't sickly nor insane, and its a dangerous mix to begin with (to be put into lamens terms).<br>  <br>  You've had this dog for two weeks, and its already showing aggression. Its clear that you were duped twice (a, you paid for the dog. b, you brought it into your home).<br>  <br>  Cane Corsos are temperamental, protective dogs who take years of training to work with and to gain trust from an owner. Rotties are intelligent, mild-mannered dogs with fantastic temperaments if bred correctly. German Shepherds (because there is no such thing as a German Schefferdog) are strong willed, highly intelligent dogs that require a firm training and ownership.<br>  <br>  This is one of two things- being that the dog is of young age, its rebellion. Or the dog was so badly bred you're sitting on a ticking time bomb.<br>  <br>  Have the dog professionally trained by an equipped trainer that knows how to deal with these breeds of dogs. Generally, an aggression specialist. Have the dog professionally trained, and if its still showing severe issues by seven months, have it evaluated by a behaviorist.<br>  <br>  Make SURE this dog is neutered by six months. There is no excuse for allowing this dog to have testosterone surges or to have the ability to breed again.

INSTEAD, give him one of his toys and praise him.|`|aCqSF87Raa	Sometimes. Some dogs love the stuff.

During teething a chew toy that can be chilled works the best.|`|oChOlCqYaa	If you can't watch your puppy, put him or her in a crate. When you are home you need to watch the puppy all the time, just as you would a human baby. Bitter apple works for some dogs but I wouldn't rely on it exclusively. Also puppy proof your home by crawling around on your hands & knees and anything you can reach that could be harmful should be move up higher, put away or gotten rid of. |`|326183ad638c65397360f6a4dcc9abfaaa	it works very well with most dogs (worked with one dog of mine, but not the other).  also, crate your dog when you can't directly supervise him/her.  it will save you heartache & expense.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|JTxb2HR2aa	Crate her unless you can supervise her.<br>  <br>  She is teething - give her acceptable things to chew on instead.|`|rGlJ2FbUaa	It's a puppies job to check out its world and discover what things are about. And our job to help them learn.<br>  There are now a few different nasty tasting products as some dogs are indifferent to bitter apple. Take your puppy with you to the pet supply store and test them to find the one that makes your puppy go "yeck".  Buy this one and use it liberally. If something only tastes mildly bad the puppy may still go for the object but if it's a strong distaste then the fun is gone.<br>  Pick a command such as Leave It or whatever you prefer and when you catch the puppy chewing on it use the command, offer something the puppy can have as a positive alternative and spray the object.<br>  If you can, spray the object out of sight of the puppy and give it 10 minutes for the smell to settle.  I've known puppies who once they saw an object sprayed just didn't touch that object associating the spray with it. But went for similar unsprayed objects like the 'other' socks/cords.  We want the puppy to realize it's the object that is no fun.<br>  The advantage of the bitter spray is that the object is no fun whether you are around or not.<br>  And of course you've already puppy proofed your house as much as possible.|`|nSev0G2Haa	apple bitter will work, but the best way to curb that kind of behavior is to give your puppy things he can chew on.  If you catch him in the act of chewing, say " AH-AH!" loudly, take away what he's chewing, and give him a rope toy or something, and praise him for chewing on what he's allowed.  If you make sure that your dog has plenty of exercise, chew toys (ropes and rawhides), and doesn't get anxiety, then he should probably stop that when he has all his adult teeth.  Good luck!|`|mdGr8Jadaa	Yes it will. We used this in our puppy class.

Actually, it is more likely that people contract something from a pet.<br>  <br>  Just go ahead and love and hold and kiss your furbaby. You need soothing when you are ill.|`|iNYDUFdGaa	 Nope...it will give you good bonding time with your puppy while your sick from school/work so spend as much time with him as you can. |`|xJhfxnEtaa	 I don't think so... I was sick with the flu and cold many times, and my dog never left my bedside.  She didn't get sick at all.  But, she is an adult dog, so I don't know if being a puppy makes any difference.  And, you might want to define "sick." |`|TZDQI6v4aa	Your puppy is the best companion you can get to help you over your sickness <br>  If you have any worries go to your vet to confirm your & answer your question as there are some sickness that we get that occassionally can be passed on |`|PQXiXEZKaa	Nope. <br>  When im sick my dogs are my cuddle buddies <br>  Especially when you have menstrual cramps, if you have a small dog or cat on your belly makes it feel better :)|`|F9LRKwMyaa	No|`|wQswAs2kaa	The correct term for sicknesses that can be passed from humans to animals/animals to humans/animals to animals is called, "Zoonosis."<br>  <br>  It greatly depends on what you have.  Any open scars?  Don't let your dog lick them, even if he/she wants to.  <br>  <br>  Try to avoid putting your face near his/her face during this time.<br>  <br>  Don't let your dog lick your face and wash your hands thoroughly. . . and often after sneezing/coughing.  If it is the common cold or cough, then no, I don't think anything can be passed onto him/her.  But I am not a veterinarian.  Just a vet tech student.  <br>  <br>  However, if you have a disease or something worse than the cold/cough, then please call your vet's office and ask them.  You don't need to pay to have this kind of question answered :)  If your vet clinic won't tell you without having you come in (to examine your puppy), try calling around to other clinics and asking them.  If most or all say you should come in, then they likely have a good reason to be concerned.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you:)|`|qbs2J0zoaa	no. human and dog immune system a completely different. if it is just a cold then don't worry and get better.

You put her in a down for a few minutes and each time increase the amount of time she's in the down until you can get about 30 minutes before you release her from the down. Lay her on her back for a short time and don't let her up until you say it's OK to get up. There are several ways you can do these and stay calm when you do them but firm. No hitting. They learn nothing from hitting, even a little hit. The need to learn to respect you  as the leader.

People come here to get genuine answers to genuine questions, and that is what I always try to do. My best friend got me to join here because she knows of my knowledge of animals. So, I will give you my honest opinion and see if <br>  I can help you. Your b/f got started on the wrong foot. He should not hit her. And because he has, she now thinks he is going to every time he comes near her. So biting him is her defense against him. He needs to do a 180 with her. He needs to start petting her, giving her treats and talk to her in a soft, loving tone of voice. Males have a deep voice and if they yell, it scares dogs and they become defensive. So talking to her in a soft voice will do wonders to win back her confidence. He should not smack her on the butt or any where else. If he continues to do so, she will get worse around him because she associates him with pain. I think if he will follow this, he may be able to win her friendship. I hope this helps you and best of luck to you.<br>  Source(s):<br>  Lifelong dow owner and breeder<br>  Horse owner and breeder|`|a9YfUGzSaa	Did you read what I already said to you?  I sympathized with you and told you exactly what to do.<br>  <br>  Just in case you didn't, I'll repost it.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if it is you or your boyfriend striking the dog, it is your dog, it is your responsibility to keep him from striking it.<br>  <br>  Here's the deal. I am not going to accuse you of beating your dog, because I understand you're not taking her out back and pummeling her. However, a dog is not like a human child. For a human child, spanking works because as they grow up and mature you can accompany an aversive training technique with an explanation, and they eventually develop a sense of right and wrong and understand why they have been punished. Dogs do NOT know right from wrong, and they never develop this sense. They know "this behavior pleases my owner," and "this behavior does not get me what I want," be it positive attention, treats, etc. By spanking the dog, in a less dominant breed, you may still get the desired behavior. But it is not out of training, it is out of fear. A dog does not understand it is being punished, only that it is being hurt -- no matter how mild, a dog does not know the difference between being swatted and being beaten, pain is pain. If you train a dominant dog like a pit bull to fear you, it WILL be aggressive toward you.<br>  <br>  Invest in a good professional trainer, not just the pet store obedience class. Someone who better understands your specific dog can train her better and can also help teach you how to handle her. If you cannot do that, you have to give her up. Whether to a shelter or to a friend better equipped, if you train a pit to be aggressive and it bites, you are damaging the breed's reputation even more than it already is. And that's not fair to the pit, pit bulls are lovely dogs when handled properly.<br>  <br>  I hope this makes sense to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Your leash issues, she IS trying to "take you" for a walk. She wants to dominate you. You cannot let her. There are a couple different things you can do for this. There is bitter apple spray that can be sprayed onto the leash to deter her from wanting to grab it. This won't teach her not to dominate you, but she will leave the leash alone. Same with a leash that has a chain, the metal wont be fun to chew. What I usually do when I am walking them is I step down on the leash as close to the collar as I can so the dog will be forced to lay down and not have the leash in its mouth. Don't force it obviously, and if you think this will piss her off enough to bite you DONT try it, but for the dogs I have worked with usually being forced to lay down and not being able to move their head served as a deterrent. Every time they'd misbehave on the leash, I'd make them lay down and stay still until they settle down, and then continue on. While they are squirming, I ignore them so they realize this kind of bad behavior will not get my attention. While they are walking nicely, I talk to them in a soft, sweet voice to encourage them to continue. If they misbehave, stop talking to them, go back to the beginning and repeat. Consistently. The trick is to consistently show her that you are in charge (NOT AGGRESSIVELY OR SHE WILL RESPOND WITH AGGRESSION), and that trying to dominate you does not get her what she wants. Your dog may be too dominant right now for you to do this by yourself, so you REALLY need the aid of a professional trainer experienced with pits.<br>  <br>  Another basic dominance thing, make sure you dont let her pull you around or walk in front of you. Always walk through doors before her, always make her wait for you, train her to heel on command and stay there, make her sit down before getting treats, make her sit or lay down before you put her food bowl down for her. These are basic behaviors that can help you reassert your dominance. They are tools that will help you teach her that she has to yield to you if she is going to get what she wants. And when she does yield, reward her so she knows this is desired behavior. Dogs, ESPECIALLY pits, are loving and loyal to their owners. If she understands you are pack leader, she will be HAPPY to do whatever makes you happy.<br>  <br>  <br>  Bottom line - Don't strike the dog, don't allow anyone else to strike the dog, and please, PLEASE hire a trainer before you have an accident. And the relationship between your boyfriend and your pit will need lots of time and LOTS of patience to heal. Do not allow him to act aggressively toward her, no matter what she does, and do not allow him to behave aggressively in her presence. If she continues to think she has to defend herself against him, this is a volatile relationship between human and dog and is dangerous for everyone involved.|`|bPdqwkpPaa	Your BF is aggressive.  Your dog is fear-biting. <br>  <br>  Either the BF needs to change his tune, or the dog will have to go.  And the dog will be killed in a shelter because of him. <br>  <br>  Yes, the dog needs training, but the BF needs more.  And frankly, I couldn't be around a BF who thinks it's funny to pizz me off and hurt an animal.  He sounds like he's about 8 years old.  <br>  <br>  <br>  I can't make it any more simple.  Your BF is basically abusing the dog by being aggressive towards him.  It may not be a legal definition of abuse, but it's de facto.<br>  <br>  <br>  Added: <br>  I was thinking more and more about this and I wanted to clarify my answer. <br>  There is a difference between aggressive training and assertive training.  If your dog is trying to dominate you, then you need to have a firmer hand.  However, that does not mean hitting (or smacking as you state) your dog.  <br>  Pits are known for trying to test their boundaries.  You need to not be a pushover.  But, this is no accomplished by jerking the dog around, hitting it, or garbbing collars. <br>  I think the whole lot of you need to get into a firmer obedience class.  The general one you are in is not appropriate for the problems you are having. <br>  <br>  All this is aside from the issue that your BF is completely disrespectful to you.   You've asked him not to hit the dog, and he still does it.  This is a huge warning sign - especially when violence is involved.|`|nlMfJtxcaa	Negative physical contact such as smacking is technically physical aggression or abuse. The dog responds to physical aggression with physical aggression. Dogs that are fearful and aggressive toward people as puppies grow up to be DANGEROUS DOGS. <br>  <br>  Unless your boyfriend stops touching her negatively she will always be fearful and respond that way. Obedience training isn't going to solve this problem. Getting rid of your boyfriend and getting a dog trainer in will. <br>  <br>  So my advice, tell your boyfriend to stop touching her, or get rid of the boyfriend. He is causing a huge problem. Aggressive dogs are dangerous and can cost you thousands of dollars in dog bite damages.|`|0hTvKlD5aa	 You must contact a trainer who has experience in dealing with aggressive dogs. Even dog behaviorists will have trouble making a diagnosis over the internet without actually meeting her, and even if they could give advice it can be dangerous to attempt to correct a dog with a dominance problem if you don't know exactly what you're doing. Look online, or ask your vet to refer you to a good trainer. <br>      Has she been seen by the vet, to rule out any pain or nuerological reasons for aggression?  Is she getting enough exercise? I like to ride my bike for a couple hours a day, and I take my APBT along. It's a great way to make sure she's getting the exercise a high-energy dog needs. That could be the cause of the "acting crazy" problem.  A can of pennies that you shake to distract her while jumping can help solve that problem. Getting rid of your boyfriend could solve the problem. I don't really know, but the trainer will. <br>      I'm sure you already know that pit bulls have a bum rep, but I'll just reiterate it for you. What your pit bull does, affects all us pit bull owners, which is why having a well-behaved non agressive dog is super, duper important. Please listen to everyone's advice, and get on contacting that trainer! Good luck!|`|16d570b2a5b1dc85d7f15e4a1cbc7feaaa	I would give you advice, but you wouldn't take it.  |`|1868dc03c33039f8ae0fe4351eda6159aa	You need to start by disciplining your dog.  Your boyfriend is obviously doing a better job at this, because you said the dog listens to him.  However, he doesn't know much about dogs to try to grab a growling dog's collar.  It doesn't matter why she was growling, he shouldn't have grabbed her, he should have handled the growling issue and gotten her to submit before attempting to take a hold of her collar.  <br>  <br>  My recommendation, see if one of your obedience instructors will do a private, at home lesson.  This way, they can deal with your problems one on one.  Dogs should NEVER be allowed to nip.  At 5 months old, she should have already learned not to use her teeth.  <br>  <br>  If you don't gain control over her soon, you are going to have larger problems on your hands.|`|AA12083992	I am not yelling. Never hit a dog. Big Period. Obedience classes are great. Talk to your class instructor about your issues. Bully breeds are very stubborn and need a strong (not abusive) handler. Never use a crate for punishment. Her crate should be her refuge, not a punishment. Yes, your dog will take over as alpha if allowed. Some tips to help with that:<br>  Feed her after you eat, alpha's eat first.<br>  When you feed her first put her in a sit, stay. Do not allow her to dive into her dish till you give the free command. Alpha's control the food. <br>  Precede her through doorways and up or down stairs. Alpha's are always first. <br>  When you arrive home do not pet her until she is sitting calmly.<br>  Lay down the law to your b/f about how she will be handled. An out of control dog (any breed) is a dangerous dog. <br>  Stick with the obedience classes and remember to practice, practice, practice. The instructor does not train your dog but teaches you how to train your dog. Please talk to the trainer about these issues. Five months old is not to late but you really have to learn how to handle a bully breed. Use your public library, check out some books on training bully breeds. Talk to your trainer. Good luck<br>  |`|CsKGdUx0aa	Temperament is genetic. Cannot be changed, only molded. <br>  <br>  Tell your BF to keep his hands off your dog. Physical discipline is OK, but if it's yeilding undesired effects, there's no reason for it to continue. <br>  <br>  45 minutes of exercise isn't enough. She needs more physical stimulation and more mental stimulation. Obedience lessons should be practiced at home EVERY DAY.<br>  <br>  A pit bull is not an easy dog to raise (I've done it 3 times over). And, if you cannot sucessfully and confidently set rules and limits and proper discipline, than you shouldn't have chosen this breed.<br>  <br>  When did you begin crate training with her? If she doesn't want to go in, she's not comfortable with the crate, which is owner error. Play with her in and around the crate. Leave the door open and treat her when she goes in on her own. Regress to the beginning stages if necessary.|`|JtZfTiEEaa	The advice (once again) is quite simple.  This dog needs to be evaluated, in person, by a reputable trainer to deal with aggressive dogs.  Having a dog that has bitten a human, for ANY reason, needs to be evaluated.  And carefully.  Fear aggression is a dangerous thing, and if this dog is a fear biter, your young child is at risk, as is any human being that comes anywhere near her.   If the traner can not give you good advice, then the dog needs to be euthanized.  Plain and simple.<br>  <br>  Without a face to face evaluation of your dog's actual issues, any advice given to you on this forum about how to handle your dog is extremely risky, and can result in someone being severely injured.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that I'm not giving you the advice you want to hear, so you just keep posting the question over and over again until you hear what you want to hear.  But, hearing what you think you want to hear doesn't change the situation, and won't make it better.<br>  <br>  Please, for the sake of your young child--seek a professional trainer NOW.|`|tY14vbrKaa	I sent you an e-mail with my well thought out answer that go deleted.  Please refer there for my assistance and advice.|`|wrUsMG4Jaa	As someone who works professionally with APBTs and APBT mixes, I see this a lot with dogs who aren't being understood by their owners.<br>  <br>  This dog is challenging your roll as dominant female because you haven't asserted yourself. APBTs are naturally dominant dogs, they require constant training and a firm hand 24-7. <br>  <br>  They're smart enough to realize that if an owner isn't 100% in charge all the time, that the position is open for the taking, and she'll take it.<br>  <br>  They're also active dogs, its clear by your description of her behavior that one walk a day isn't cutting it. I'd invest in a bike lead (I'll provide links) so she can run rather than just walk.<br>  <br>  Labs are naturally water dogs, they love the water and to swim. Terriers are dogs that enjoy fast activities, so if you try to appease both of her natural natures, and wear her out, you'll have a happier and better balanced dog.<br>  <br>  When she doesn't listen, and she starts acting out in a hyper way, ignore her. Don't yell, scream, try to grab her, or anything, just ignore her. If you turn your back and don't speak or look at her, she'll get the message that hyperactivity doesn't get attention- and attention (in any form) can be a reward for her.<br>  <br>  To assert dominance, work with her more. Show her that you're in control by practicing her obedience commands together. Have her do strings of commands (four or five) before giving her praise or a treat. <br>  <br>  You need to be the one to provide her food- when she's fed, feed her pieces from her bowl while you're standing up and she's sitting down. After eight or nine pieces, set the food down, and tell her to wait.<br>  <br>  The wait command is vital for being dominant. Stand in front of her bowl and tell her to sit, step out from in front of her bowl, and if she goes towards it, step back in front, and tell her to WAIT. Do it as many times as it takes until she understands that she has to wait for your command of "take it" (Which you need to say when she's allowed to eat) to eat.<br>  <br>  As for her fear aggression with her boyfriend- he HAS to stop. There is a difference between being dominant and firm, and being dominant and abusive. If he continues this, she'll be terrified of having anyone as head of the pack- including you.<br>  <br>  Since she HAS bitten someone, she should be evaluated by a professional behaviorist to see if this was an aggressive bite (out of pure aggression), or a bite that was triggered for self defense.<br>  <br>  If he lives with you, the two of you need to have an EQUAL balance of control. <br>  <br>  Hitting a dog is NEVER a form of correction, no matter if its a tap or a slap. They associate the abuse with the person, and they learn that the person brings them pain- why keep that person around? She's growling to tell him that she wants him away from her, and to STAY away.<br>  <br>  Don't EVER force a dog into its crate. A crate is supposed to be a safe haven for dogs, if you use it for punishment or with force, they'll grow to hate it. <br>  <br>  YOU need to work with her on this too, have a treat, and have her walk into the crate. When two feet are inside, say crate. She'll have to go all the way in and turn around to get the treat, when she does, give her the treat.<br>  <br>  If she becomes tense, shakes, growls, whines, or shows ANY signs of discomfort, bring her out and redirect her attention onto something else, try again once she's calm.<br>  <br>  I advise you to train this dog yourself. (No offense intended, at all), you never know if you and your boyfriend will last 100%, and if she obeys him and not you, if you two break up you'll have a dog that doesn't respect you on your hands.|`|87QWi3lWaa	Did you get her recently perhaps where her current owners may have beaten her? Does she do well in her training classes? I would suggest taking her to a behaviorist...or someone that specializes in training pit bulls especially ones that may have aggressive behavior. If you are able to correct this behavior while she's young it may never be a problem again...but it all depends on the dog and the actions you take.<br>  <br>  Here is a website for you to better determine what kind of behavior she is having so that you can correctly inform a new trainer or behaviorist. <br>  <a href="http://www.happypitbull.com/ownermanual/aggression.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.happypitbull.com/ownermanual/...</a><br>  <br>  I wish you a lot of luck!<br>  The public and media incorrectly label these dogs as "killers" all the time and I hope you are able to find the resources to turn her into the well behaved loyal pit she can be!|`|JHoeiFZCaa	I <3, I think that you have two problems. The first one is that your pup is only 5 months old. Having an obedient dog is great, but unless you are training her to be a working dog you may be putting too much stress on her. I do not have a pit, but I don’t think that breed matters. You do need a constant authoritative voice and when ever you command or even casually talk to her make sure you are standing over her to show dominance. I like to use a different hand gesture with each command. (only one hand and don’t make it seam like you are going to hit her) The second thing is your BF he must stress her out!  He must abuse her in some way, maybe not intestinally, but she sees it as such. Maybe he should back off a bit. You could also try spraying her on the nose with one quick spray from a water spray bottle to show her who is boss. I hope that this helps somewhat the most important thing is to REWARD, REWARD, REWARD!!!!!  You can use treats or praise I use both and it took some patients and till she was about 12 months. Now I have the greatest dog you could dream of. Best of all she will listen to my wife and kids too.|`|O9my81Nzaa	I have a lab mix, and even though I adopted her when she was a puppy, she still gets scared if someone 'smacks' her butt. I would recommend not doing that anymore. If the dog was beaten before she came to you, then continuing it won't help at all. <br>  The crate should not be a scary thing for a dog, they should feel safe in their crate. With your dog, I wouldn't use the crate for disciplining her. try giving her a treat each time she goes in the crate, then when you tell her to go in, she will be more willing to go. If you want to disipline her, pick a coner of the room, that is away from you, and make her lay down there and then ignore her.<br>  Try being firm with her, don't yell at her, but be firm. It's hard at first to get your tone right, it took me 3 weeks to figure out what it meant. Your voice should remain one tone throughout the entire command. If you are the boss, then when you stare at your dog, she should look away, it's a sign of respect. If she does this, then she understands that you are in control and she has to do what you say.<br>  Another thing that people forget is if you take your dog to puppy classes, you absolutely have to keep up with it. If the dog is learning well in class, he might not obey in another environment, unless you practice it where ever you go. (this is because he hasn't been taught to obey outside of puppy class.)<br>  So, when your at home, pick a command, i.e sit, and when he does, give him a small treat, until he does it on command. (gradually take away the treats) Then practice it when you're walking. I make my dog sit everytime we come to a road, she doesn't get to move until she sits. (I recommend this, My dog got away from me by a busy road, and because I taught her to sit at every road, It saved her life. She was chasing a squrriel, and when she got to the road, she sat down and waited for the cars to stop before she crossed the road to get the squrriel) <br>  ***But don't give her a reward until she does what you want her too. And never ever just give up. If you give up because she won't sit, then you'll never get her to. She'll think that if she doesn't do it, you'll eventually stop.<br>  Also try getting her to "ask" for things. Make her sit before you give her food, or make her lie down before you throw a ball for her. <br>  ***But remember not to give in, so don't throw the ball until she does what you asked her to.***<br>  If your dog is running around in circles, or doing laps through the house, it's probly because she needs more exersize or she has too much energy and she needs to get rid of it. All dogs with high energy do this. If you have a fenced in yard, let her out and let her run, or take her to the dog park once a week, and let her run around. <br>  Another thing you could do is make her sit before she gets in the car. If she gets up before you tell her to get in, make her sit again. If you keep making her do it over and over again, then she gets the idea that she isn't going anywhere unless you say.<br>  ***If she is growling at him, then for one, stop smacking her butt, she obviously doesn't like it. and then have her follow a treat to the crate, give her half when she gets to the crate, and put the other half in the crate, that way she goes in. <br>  If you don't have a command for going into the crate, you need one. Try using "kennel up" Then eventually you will just say "kennel up" and she will automatically go in her crate. make sure you praise her for going in, giving her a treat and telling her shes a good dog should work. You can also give her a pat on the head when she turns around. If she starts to bark when you walk away, ignore her, if you take it out, then she will get it in her head that if she wines, you will let her out. <br>  If she bit him when he went to go get her to put her in the kennel, it might be because she has anxiety problems. most dogs don't like it when you leave. They get very attatched, but some more than others. You might want to look into that, try asking your vet about it. <br>  Also make sure that her kennel has things that she likes in it, her favorite blanket, a toy that can not be chewed up. (The dog could shew it and choke on the peices, never put a bone in the kennel with her, unless you are there to watch her.) You could get her a Kong ball and  the treats that go with it. Put a treat in it, and put it in her kennel each tme you leave, that way she will be distracted by it,a nd it will give her something to do.<br>  Another thing is when you are walking her, let her go potty, then shorten the leash and walk fast, kinda like speed walking. Dogs need a purpose. each dog was bred to do something, so by walking fast, she will be focused on that and plus she gets a workout.<br>  <br>  I take my dog on a walk once a day, it usually last about an hour at the least, more like 2. I take water with me, so I can walk longer. and during the summer I ride my bike, and she runs next to me, those last about 2 hours at the least. If you walk for that long, bring water. Also, if|`|S5PXIMiMaa	I believe you should study you boyfriend's behavior. I have had this problem with my dog also. You have to believe you are her leader and she is a dog. You don't have to yell but the dog has to know your not playing BE STERN. Do you go with the dog to obedience class?? If not try to go and work with your dog. You need to become the pack leader. Make sure YOU AND ONLY YOU are doing ALL feeding, taking her to do her business, and everything else (like toys, treats . . .) comes from you. Work to train her and give treats when she obeys. And if you do have to show force a swat on the butt isn't bad but try pinching by her neck. In a pack, the leader bits the other dogs on their neck to make them summit. Ok, of course do not hurt your dog - it is just to get their attention. I hope this helps!!!|`|SsOvxYckaa	I would get the advice of a dog behaviourist.  I had a similar problem with our first dog and we got a professional to advise us.  He gave us loads of advice about making sure the dogs did not get on the settee, that they let the humans through the door first and that they walk on a loose lead, looking to us for direction.  We were also told to always eat our dinner first before feeding the dogs and stop all rough and tumble play.  <br>  <br>  It is really important you get a professional to advise you before it gets to the stage where you have to give her up, because if you haven't taught her better she will find it difficult to find a new home.<br>  <br>  The behaviourist wasn't cheap but he literally turned our lives around on the spot and now i have a beautifully behaved little scamp that i can take anywhere and be comfortable with her.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  x|`|boNPsJGLaa	my dogs staff cros pit<br>   <br>  <br>  she goes off like that do smacking her on the bum does help some people chat poo saying its beating them. but at the end of the day a dog has to learn and if your gonan sit their saying good boy then .. u kno u cant do that so just keep saying no and walk out the room |`|evU8NlZOaa	I think what the problem is that your dog feels like she can be dominate over your, that's why it doesn't obey. If you scold your dog when not obeying and when the dog finally does respond, try giving her a treat. When the dog bites what you need is a rolled up newspaper and put shiny silver duct tape around it untill you cant see the newspaper, and when the dodisobeysys give in a tap on the but or on the nose(the dog will respond quicker to nose) soon you dog will realize that if she bites then she will bdisciplineded, and when doing this say bad dog in the worst voice you can. I know this sounds mean but trust me within a week or 2 your dog will not eveattemptmp these things if she knows that you have the newspaper. When the dog isnt acting like this carry on with being very loving but always have the newspaper around for when she does misbehave|`|n6lPYsxwaa	Your dog is a puppy, she will calm down.  I would try to go to obedience training more than once a week for a while.  If she doesn't like the crate put up a fence and leave her in the kitchen or put her in doggy day care.  You definitely want to get the biting under control though since people in this world are sue happy.|`|q9162JNsaa	You have a puppy, he can be changed with time and consistency and positive reinforcement.  If he is having a nipping/biting issue you may have to result to a soft training muzzle until you can teach him to stop that behavior.  Do not let anyone stare at your dog, this may be causing aggression, dogs view that as a an aggressive act, such as in Great Danes. |`|zHBwyN5gaa	The boyfriend has alienated the dog. 5 months means the dog has yet to really learn the correct social behaviors, and his actions are leading her down the wrong path. He needs to stop. NEVER approach a dog that is lying down and growls, I know from experience-even the best trained dog will bite if scared or threatened.<br>  <br>  As for the dominance, use positive reinforcement to teach her right from wrong. If you see she is about to nip, tell her no then give her a treat and speak positively to her. Continue to take her to training, and even ask the trainers for advice on the nipping. This might also be her being a puppy-dogs naturally nip and run around to exercise and hone their wild instincts. Telling her no and using positive reinforcement will help slow this down.|`|zrdTHa4Waa	Your BF is the problem sorry to say. You need to reinforce her with good things like treats and toys when comes to trying to put her in her crate. With dominate issues you need to show her your the boss by you eat first then you feed her but make it look like you are eating from her bowl first before you give it to her. And the next time you go back to the training class ask for tips and help on proper ways to discipline her. Maybe even go more then once a week if you can. There are also great books you can get on training. You need to get help with this now before she gets older and thinks its acceptable to do these things.
IgcHVMmbaa	High quality canned all the way!<br>  <br>  Not all pet food is made equally. A lot of it is full of corn, by-products, dyes, unhealthy preservatives, filler grains and all sorts of nasty stuff. A lot of pet food companies are perfectly happy to the dump cheap leftovers and things that aren't safe for human consumption (from human food processing plants) into their foods. Will it kill your cat? No, it has to be nutritionally complete and safe to even be marketed. Is it healthy? Not by a long shot.<br>  <br>  Corn is a low quality ingredient you never want to see in your pet food. Corn and low quality grains are two of the biggest culprits when it comes to food allergies in our pets.<br>  <br>  Thankfully, there are some excellent cat foods being made these days that include organic, human grade ingredients rather than trash not fit for human consumption.<br>  <br>  Examples of low quality foods to avoid: Anything you can find in a grocery store will be low end, Purina, Iams, Eukanuba, Science Diet, Royal Canin, Whiskas, Fancy Feast, Friskies, Meow Mix.<br>  <br>  Examples of high quality foods to look for: Innova, Wellness, Solid Gold, Felidae, Fromm Four Star, Merrick, GO Natural, Nature's Variety Prairie, Nature's Logic, Artemis Fresh Mix, Timber Wolf Organics.<br>  <br>  Although the high quality foods are more expensive, you're getting what you're paying for. Less filler material means more concentrated nutrients... this means you typically need to feed far less of the high quality food than you would of the low quality one. Which also means less poop!<br>  <br>  Before following your vet's food recommendation, keep in mind that vets get /very/ little nutritional training during their schooling. Besides that, what training they /do/ get is usually sponsored or taught by the crappy pet food companies! They also often get paid to sell some of their products at their clinics (Science Diet, Royal Canin etc.)<br>  <br>  A great option is to go with an entirely grainless diet. Diets high in grain have been attributed to problems with diabetes in cats. Cats are obligate carnivores, so why should there be grain in their diet? Many of the high quality foods now put out grainless formulas. Some good grainless diets include: Innova EVO, Wellness CORE, Blue Wilderness, Nature's Variety Instinct, Orijen, Horizon Legacy, Merrick Before Grain, Fromm Surf & Turf, Now!, and Sold Gold Indigo Moon, Taste of the Wild.<br>  <br>  Some pretty decent foods can even be found in common pet stores. Petsmart carries Blue Buffalo products (such as the excellent grain free diet Blue Wilderness). Petco carries Wellness, Solid Gold, Natural Balance, Eagle Pack Holistic, Blue Buffalo, Castor & Pollux Organix, Pinnacle, and Halo. If you can't find a food, most of the high quality food brands have websites with store locators on them.<br>  <br>  Another option, if you can't find anywhere around you that sells good foods, is to order your pet food online. Here's an excellent place to do so: <a href="http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfooddirect.com/store/</a><br>  <br>  Remember that foods should be switched gradually (mixing new slowly in with the old over about a two week period), especially when switching to a higher quality one, so as not to upset tummies.<br>  <br>  Another option for feeding cats is to feed raw. This is something that should be thoroughly researched before being attempted:<br>  <a href="http://www.rawfedcats.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfedcats.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.rawfed.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.rawfed.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wysong.net/controversies/rawmeat.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.wysong.net/controversies/rawm...</a><br>  <br>  Now the question is, do you feed wet or dry? Wet is the correct answer. The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:<br>  <a href="http://www.catinfo.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catinfo.org/</a>  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)<br>  <a href="http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canned_food.htm" rel="nofollow">http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?action=library&act=show&item=whycatsneedcannedfood" rel="nofollow">http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bpo_ch4.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp...</a><br>  <a href="http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.htm" rel="nofollow">http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht...</a><br>  <br>  Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.<br>  <br>  More:<br>  <a href="http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_reviews/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogfoodanalysis.com/dog_food_...</a> (Dog food reviews.

65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	Actually, that is a fine idea.  I did see this recommended by a trainer (sorry, I can't remember where I read the article...I think it was in a vet tech magazine).  They were actually training adult dogs, but I don't see why it wouldn't work for a pup.  The article was about dogs who were not obedient to their owners, and the basic idea was to make them work for their food and attention.  It made great sense.<br>  <br>  Another suggestion, if you haven't tried it yet, is to put the kibble in a Kong, a treat ball, a Tug-A-Jug, etc.  Or in several different toys.  Or, hide the kibbles throughout the house and play hide n seek.  Not only will your pup get nutrition, he'll think it's all treats, and it will be fun and stimulate his intelligence as well.<br>  <br>  I strew one of my cat's kibbles across a room, because she is an absolute hog about eating, and would gulp her own food down and then steal the other two kitties' chow as well.  Now she eats in another room and has to 'hunt' for her food.  More fun for her and much more pleasant for the other two. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you're doing a great job.  Good luck with your pup!|`|R9qtysGqaa	Putting water in the food won't slow him down like some people think.  If you don't mind doing it and it works than that's fine.  Other than that the only other option is to put just a little in his bowl at a time.  When he's done with that wait 5 or 10 minutes and put just a little bit more in and so on until hes done with his food.  good luck|`|vouUQQzBaa	Moisten the food with water.  That will cut down the gulping of the food and will decrease the air intake as well. It'll slow your pup down :)|`|vORwcxhkaa	This is actually really normal for puppies. My puppy would do the exact same thing. As they get older they will learn to slow down.<br>  <br>  For the mean time, you can either leave it, or keep doing what your doing. Anything is fine.|`|746YLjISaa	You dont need to feed him 3 times a day unless your vet wants you to. Instead of feeding him just dry or just wet, mix it up! Put about a teaspoon of wet food and about 1/4 of a cup dry. And stirr it up and mix it up. This will not onley slow down his eating it will give him variety  in his food.Good Luck!
MfcTIdlraa	It will probably stay brownish color.  They rarely change.  The yellow bred with a Chocolate somewhere back in the line will produce that effect.  One never knows when that will pop up in a litter.  Lucky for the one with the black nose!|`|F4rCjV1haa	It will more then likely stay med.brown.There is a little chance it will get darker.But I don't think so.Plus I like brown noses.It give them charter .Good Luck|`|je09fnkaaa	it may darken up when he gets older, but he will probably keep the rose/chocolate colored nose. its pretty much just up to chance, when I got my dog his nose was solid pink, but now its almost all black with like 2 flecks of pink.|`|rXMTdUg4aa	Sometimes they do and sometimes they don't. You'll just have to wait and see.|`|eznL5Zwvaa	Maybe it will maybe it will not.|`|Mz4qj7gAaa	each pup is speacil in it's own way more than likely it will stay the same. hope this helps=)|`|2WUKnRQyaa	my yellow lab first had a black nose when she was a small puppy, id hoped it would stay black but as she got older its not brownish/pinkish lol i read about it and it can be colors just from natural pigment in the skin or if the dog has any kind of mix in her or one of the parents had mix. hope it helped good luck|`|2639c3Pcaa	Nope, it will be like that. I haven't seen a lab whose nose got darker from light pigment. Only darker pigment become lighter as it ages.|`|03xi1bToaa	probably
746YLjISaa	Why would you put cologne on your dog!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	No you need to use the safe essential oils. Honestly it would be cheaper to buy a commercial doggie cologne instead of making one. Here is a place I buy products for myself & they sell a number of essential oils & other herbal products.  It will give you an idea how much stuff costs.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ozarkherbals.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ozarkherbals.com/</a><br>  <br>  Commercial ones cost between $4 - $10 for good sized bottles.|`|EeJMITyCaa	I've never heard of dog perfume! What is he purpose of it?
Q4pUDkyHaa	Don't rip him out of his hide.<br>  That's a violation of trust, like grabbing a rat by his tail.<br>  They don't trust you if you try to do that.<br>  If he's in his hide, leave him alone.<br>  Also, it would be helpful for me to know how heavy in grams, how old, what size prey items you're feeding him, and how you're feeding.<br>  For aggression, there are a few things to check first.<br>  <br>  Hot spot too hot/too small: What size is his hot spot in relation to his mass? What temp does it hit, if it gets over 88F, it's too hot. A good rule of thumb is to have gentle warmth in 1/3 of his enclosure. Mid-80s, 82-85F it feels cool to the touch to you or me, but 88F is too hot, and will make a snake aggressive. If the only spot in his cage that's warm is too small for him to fit on, he will be on it all day, and won't share that spot with anyone or anything. He will defend his warm territory with an aggressive display. <br>  <br>  Snake feels exposed: This is from inadequate hides, tank too bright, too much noise/movement in tank area. A quick help is to tape a grocery bag to 3 sides of his cage, so you can't see through it on all 4 sides. Tank backgrounds are good, too. If the snake is in a high traffic hallway, they will always be scared, and will take a defensive position right away.If you never had any privacy, you'd be cranky, too.<br>  <br>  Feeding too small prey items, or feeding live: Kings are aggressive feeders, if they're not being fed enough, they will become aggressive in the search for food. Also, feeding live is a bad idea, as it forces them to be aggressive, for a calm, injury free snake, feed frozen/thawed.<br>  <br>  Territorial/body language/startled snake:  If you rip his hide off from him, and approach from above (Like a predator would.) he will put on a display. This is his territory, and you're in it. If you touch his head or tail with no introduction (Like a predator would.) you've also earned predator status. <br>  <br>  Wrong time: Sometimes you catch him at the wrong time, you accidentally make a lot of noise trying to get his cage open, etc. Also, if he's in a shedding cycle, or he ate within 36 hours. He knows he's gonna be torpid and not able to defend himself during these times, so he throws an impressive bluff before resorting to other tactics.<br>  <br>  Feeding response/feeding error: If the only reason you open the cage is to dangle a mouse in front of him, he will associate the cage opening with being fed. Once he makes this association he goes directly into feeding mode and may blindly strike at you or anything that moves. It's because he thinks you're food. To break this association, you have to form a new one. Open his cage every day you can, not just on feeding days. Get his tank ready to open, and put the f/t mouse on top of the cage top, and fan the air into his tank until he shows feeding interest, then tong the mouse to your snake. Feed with tongs every time. He won't associate 'the hand' or it's smell with food or feeding.<br>  <br>  Positive reinforcement: In spite of everything else, if your snake has learned that if he wants to be left alone, and throws a bluff or 2 in your direction and you leave him alone, then he will do it every time. Put on a pair of gloves if you must, but if he goes into a defensive posture every time he sees you, and it works, then he has no reason to change anything because it's working for him. Let him know it's not working for you. Pick him up, and handle him. Every day (except feeding day, and the next day or 2.). Don't handle him for a long time at first, just handle him until he calms down, then a few more minutes. Don't stress him out too much, put him back and leave him alone for the rest of the day. Just don't let him think that all he has to do is bite you, and you go away, or he will bite you, every time.<br>  <br>  ***EDIT***<br>  Temps sound good, sounds like he's getting enough to eat.<br>  Don't take away a snake's hide if you can avoid it.<br>  It sounds like he spends a lot of time in his hide, maybe tape a grocery bag or a nice tank background to the back of his tank? Or a piece of furniture to explore, like a piece of driftwood? A big piece of cork? Maybe an old shirt that smells like you? They like random items in their cage, it makes them feel like they maybe don't have to hide as much. Snakes hate being in the open.|`|LxqJ138Uaa	He has a hiding space, if you lift it up he will be aggressive towards you. He probably thinks he is going to eat every time you open the cage. Stop feeding the snake inside the cage. Remove the hiding space temporarily during the day. Also sometimes when the temperatures are really really high it makes them agitated and gives them a lot of energy.|`|sSJ8zfebaa	california kings-i have 1-love to be handled.now he is noy used to you and you need to regain his trust.i have a couple that will do that at times but once i get them out they are fine.use something to lift him out and then he will probably be fine.handle him regurly and then dont stop-even in winter

AA11039906	I also live in Illinois but further up in McHenry County. <br>  <br>  I checked on line and found some breeders in Il but not very many. If you want to take a day trip, go up to Corbin's Exotic Pet shop, they hand feed their birds. There is also a breeder in Rockford but I forget his site.<br>  <br>  The place where I got my bird was at Birds and Beasts pet shop in Crystal Lake. They get alot of their birds from breeders or they hand raise, feed and breed them themselves. They are very tame.<br>  <br>  Look around.

stMcVPCMaa	I tried to train one of my dogs to go outside or in a doggy litter box (you can get them and litter pellets at petco or petsmart) but found that my dog totally could not grasp the concept of "outside and inside but only one place inside".  Once I went back to the traditional "outdoor only", she was a lot less confused.  I think you could train your dog to go inside in a specific place, or train your dog to go outside, but not both at the same time.  Outside is the way to go-dogs can generally learn to hold it for 8-10 hours at a time, as long as they have a regular feeding schedule.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Yes but you would be better to train it to wait until you get home.<br>  If it is a puppy then it will be confused & could learn that inside is as good as outside which is not a good plan.  You are better changing it's feeding times so that it eliminates before you go out i.e. 20 inutes or so after eating it's dinner.|`|ULUMWPsGaa	i got dog pads and during the day he uses them when i am not home try them.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	A dog can learn to hold it all night. <br>  <br>  Teach the dog to go outside.  Trying to teach them to go in a specific spot inside often confuses them and make them think that going inside anywhere is ok.|`|xZG0q6vXaa	Yes; dogs can be trained to go @ certain times even.  We keep stray dogs; we've had some that were so near death!  Even they go on the paper only when they cannot arouse us from sleep to let them out.  We've had a dog or 2 that would only go on the living room carpet or rugs in a certain spot; but that was only if the paper was not down in the laundry room.
P8Q39vA4aa	bully sticks are bull's penis yes, but i dont think rawhide comes from that area. Im not sure.

lbyX0GOJaa	use warm water and you can't use soap because it can kill your fish|`|SZOMVGBRaa	The strongest I would recommend is bleach, One parts bleach to ten parts water and then scrub the heck outta it with a clean dish sponge that has never seen soap. That should do the trick, I have cleaned many tanks this way before with no ill effects. Just wash it out well and let it air dry for a few days before you fill it up.  If that doesn't work there's always CLR cleaner but Im not sure if that's safe to use or if it evaporates out of the pores in the glass like bleach does. You may want to Research that if bleach doesn't work, best of luck.|`|70MRFokCaa	clean it with warm water and just keep cleaining it mostly the filter adn the thermomether|`|mvB53OvDaa	Bleach the crap out of it!! lol but if you don't want to use harsh chemicals i would try steaming hot water (put it in the tub) and soak soak SOAK! maybe use the toothbrush after a while like before, and as far as the bleach if the water doesn't work, (if you do decide to use bleach) make sure its washed out enough so the fish don't get poisoned,|`|R7Yjo9xSaa	when you put water in it can you see the mineral deposits? you could always try putting boiling water in there to try to soften the minerals and see if you can then scrape them out with like a putty spreader or something...good luck!!!

e81798cdc9a02390c2d954fdf61adf15aa	It depends upon the type of band.  If this is a flat band, it is a breeder band.  Breeders can choose their own letters and number sequence for the bands we have printed.  I keep mine on file with the local humane societies and veterinarians.<br>  <br>  If it is a tube-shaped steel band, it is most likely an import band.

For one, it may be required legally where you are located; two, it's a good way of identifying the bird should it ever get out (the band can be traced back to the breeder); and three 'exotic' birds that have no bands are generally considered to have been brought in illegally.|`|AA11039906	Banding is what traders do to say that the bird has come into the country legally.

SOxdyWQOaa	a filter<br>  heater<br>  stress coat helps the fish with the protective slime they have on them so don't worry about that right now<br>  <br>  <br>  18 years experience with fish|`|bDPVRtCNaa	I strongly recommend allowing the tank to cycle prior to adding fish.<br>  <br>  This site thoroughly explains the cycling process- <a href="http://aquatropicalfish.wordpress.com/2009/02/19/fishless-cycle/" rel="nofollow">http://aquatropicalfish.wordpress.com/20...</a><br>  <br>  You'll want your water temperature a little higher for tropical community fish. A temperature maintained steadily between 77F-82F, 78F would be perfect. Do you have an aquarium heater?|`|vVAwFgcJaa	Hi, <br>  2-3 days won't be enough. The normal waiting time is a month. If you are in a hurry, here is a few ideas: <br>  <br>  1- Try to fill your tank with water from an established tank. Also try to get old filtration media from an established tank. Maybe your local store can help you with this. if you can get both (water and media), your tank will be cycled immediatly. <br>  2-Get the filtration media they sell at madcaptains.com. Look for right now bacteria and tri base carbon. If you follow the instruction, you will cycle your tank within a day and will get No3 and Po4 reduction for years. I am using this system on many tanks with great succes<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|asXq2cFDaa	Sounds good. After you get the water in, only use the PH stable for every water change.<br>  Do not add any fish until the tank is fully cycled- <a href="http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/fishless_cycling.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.cichlid-forum.com/articles/fi...</a>|`|lbyX0GOJaa	just do your best|`|K9XugrFDaa	I'm glad to see you don't want to use too many chemicals.  I wouldn't recommend any of the water treatments you mention.  Test your tap water for pH instead of making changes (pet stores often do this for free).  Any of the products that modify pH aren't very stable.  Since changes in pH are more of a concern than it being too high I would stick with species that do well in the type of water you already have.<br>  <br>  I don't recommend any water treatments unless your water is treated with chloramine.  You can contact your local water treatment center to find out if chlorine or chloramine is used (they tend to be very helpful).  Aging water will allow them to evaporate out.  This takes about 24 hours for chlorine and 1 week for chloramine.  Checking the amount of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate of your water is also a very good idea (especially in agricultural areas).<br>  <br>  You really want to wait longer for the cycle to complete.  It takes a lot longer than three days though.  This will prevent a lot of headaches, disease, and wasted money.  Here is a good link to help explain the nitrogen cycle:<br>  <a href="http://www.skepticalaquarist.com/docs/nutrient/nitcyc.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.skepticalaquarist.com/docs/nu...</a><br>  <br>  Not familiar with the filter, but if it uses activated carbon I would recommend replacing the cartridge about once a month.  The bubble stone is good for providing additional aeration.  I would recommend researching any community fish first before deciding on anything (after finding out your water's pH).<br>  <br>  Here is a good freshwater site for information on different fish:<br>  <a href="http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://www.theaquariumwiki.com/Main_Page</a><br>  <br>  EDIT: Please do regular water changes, and as was mentioned by others a heater is a must if keeping tropicals.  With a stable temperature of 75F in a room temparate species like white cloud mountain minnows would be a good choice.<br>  <br>  As for products or salt being used to build up a slime coat, this is never a good idea long term.  The slime coat is built up because the skin is being irritated.  It is similar (but not as extreme) to your eyes watering when they are irritated by smoke or dust.

4eUCo2ioaa	It's up to you but if the room is quite dark I wouldn't worry about covering the cage.|`|EJpiaCMQaa	I always cover all my birds at night.  I have 3 parakeets and 2 zebra finches.  This helps them to be quiet and night and get them into a sleeping routine.  Some birds do get scared like your bird is but she should get used to being covered.  It's really up to you because she's not going to get sick if she isn't covered.  But birds do need their sleep and night so I'd suggest covering Tweety's cage.  As for words that are easy to say, try:  pretty bird, hello, and Tweety for starters.  I had one bird that said happy birthday, so you can start on harder words once they get the easy ones.  They don't always learn to talk, so don't be surprised if it doesn't talk.  Most females don't talk.|`|71i6IjdZaa	As a Budgie owner myself, normally I would recommend covering the cage with a tea towel, but as your Budgie appears to be scared, i think he would be better off without. You could always try and get him used to the cage being covered? Just a suggestion, hope my answer helps and good luck. =]|`|VRI7pqu4aa	Whether you cover the cage at night or not is a personal decision. If he seems scared, it might be a better decision not to cover the cage. However, if he chirps at first light in the morning or gets night frights, covering the cage is probably wise. If it becomes necessary to cover the cage, don't worry too much - I am sure he will get used to it.<br>  <br>  In my experience, budgies are most likely to learn to mimic a "sound" you are making, rather than actually sounding like they're saying words. Typical starting points are "pretty girl" and "hello tweety!". Training your bird to mimic sounds can be long and difficult, but rewarding! Read this link for some tips: <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1148140" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1148140</a>|`|90A2947naa	Covering the cage complete with a cloth, towel, or sheet, that is thick enough to darken the cage, but not too thick to cut off the air flow, is a good thing for any bird. This should be done on a regular basis, and your bird will get accustomed to it. It isn't uncommon for birds to look out through any gaps in the cover, or what to stay up a little longer, like a small child. But this helps them have a regular time to sleep, and is a good thing for them.<br>  As for teaching them to speak, just be repetitive around her and she will eventually start to pick up short phrases or simple words. She won't work with anything complex, so stay clear of those things, but phrases like "Pretty Bird" or "Hello, Sweetie" is easy to teach them. Some birds chose not to talk, so don't be surprise or upset if this happens with your bird. She is still a great bird, and they don't need to talk or do tricks to be a great bird. Just enjoy her for whatever she decides to be.
hcKoFZ3Daa	It is a baby drawf hamster and it started bleeding, bring him to the vet. you can't do much for him because he is so fragile.

They don't shed.  But you do have to give them hair cuts.  Keep the hair in a "puppy cut" which is short and curly.  Standards are real characters - nothing like the foo dogs you see in dog shows.<br>  Again, please adopt.  Look into a poodle rescue club within a breed's AKC dog club.

Pg3MFCBhaa	The substrate combo sounds fine...but I would suggest making a humidity box as outlined in my source article...As far as garden stores go for substrate, I wouldn't use them...but then again, that's just a personal choice. I have no data to support it, but it seems standards would be lower for products marked for landscaping vs those marked for herpetological uses.  |`|eLG73JANaa	it depends i wouldn't recommend using the sphagnum moss over the entire enclosure as that could lead to scale rot. you can put it in a corner of the enclosure and keep it damp so the ball python has a humid area to go to during shed. <br>  <br>  also you can use the garden store version. But I would be wary because that kind is not processed for bugs which could hold mites. so i would go with the pet store version.

g6sNQ7p1aa	Well! Looks like romance is in the air :) You ready for this?<br>  <br>  Cockatiels tend to be a little more lenient when it comes to you handling their eggs. A nest box would be the best idea, however, I don't think you should do anything during THIS clutch. A huge, dark box would scare the heck out of a brooding mother, and she just might go to extremes and crack the egg and kill it. Macaws will sometimes kill their babies if you just look at them wrong... So I think your best bet is to wait until the babies are fully grown and removed from the cage before you attach a nestbox for them to explore. <br>  <br>  However, if you've already got the nesting box up there and it has aspen wood shavings in it and they are not using it, chances are it's best to just leave the egg be. If the parents had preferred the nest box, they would've used it. It's awefully rare for cockatiels to detest a nest box... That's like a person preferring a cold, twin-size cot over a luxurious king-sized bed!<br>  <br>  Are you planning on letting the parents raise the chicks themselves or are you thinking about hand-feeding them and giving them out as pets? Either way, it will be hard to sell them (sorry to say) because there is a huge over-abundance of cockatiels in the US due to their easy breeding habits (as you can see :). If you've got the nest box on there already, I would take it off after their clutch is weaned to prevent breeding behavior. Otherwise you're going to end up with 100 baby birds with nowhere to go but shelters :(<br>  <br>  Keep the parents together. Sometimes the male and female will take turns sitting on the eggs, and sometimes only the female will sit while the male gets food for her and stands guard. My female used to sit on the eggs, and her husband would sit on the perch right outside the entrance to the nestbox, always making sure she was ok.<br>  <br>  A good tip to make sure your little female stays healthy: make scrambled eggs with the eggshell crushed in them. This is an excellent source of calcium for her, since she's laying eggs. Calcium levels in your female must be very high at this time because if not she can become 'eggbound," basically where she can't make the egg correctly, and this kills her. A good pelleted diet also helps.<br>  Best of luck to you and yours!|`|AA12107238	I think your supposed to separate them but I would call a breeder for complete info.  Congrats on the egg! |`|vQZ6ABxDaa	DO NOT SEPARATE THEM IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THE EGG!!Yes move the egg not garateening that they will care for the egg but i have dont that once and they did take care of it and it hatch, wash your hands before you touch the egg. you can put nesting material in the box to help the egg from clanking 2gether but make sure it is unsented and dust free and there is not to many poky hard parts that can hurt a fresh egg. Make sure you have a cuddle bone in the cage for good heath and change the water 2 times a day for good babies also you can but a boul of water on the bottom of the cage they will soak in there to help an egg come out and also to keep the eggs moist but once on egg has hatched take out the boul of water but not the normal water boul.  dont worrie one dont live there will be more but dont over breed after about 5-6 eggs then separtate if none of them has hatched after 4 months. |`|AA10091662	cockatiels are a breeding pair don't separate them if the mother does decide to take care of the egg she's sit then when she needs food/ water he will sit on the eggs for her and once the eggs hatch they take turns feeding the babies. .. we use to use cedar shavings in the bottom of the nest box ... If she laid it on the bottom of the cage and hasn't been sitting on it she may not know what to do yet and this set is a learning clutch.. put a box on the bottom with shavings put the egg in it and see if she figures it out..

CONGRATS ON YOUR BABY BIRD! :D
90A2947naa	She is most likely making these noises for you. Most single birds view their owner as their mate, and will regurgitate for them, sing to them and so on. Just be grateful and pay her a lot of attention. I wouldn't worry about discouraging the behavior much, since she is single, and just make sure she has toys, both hanging and foot toys, and plenty attention and care. It is good she is not hissing, since she no longer feels threatened now. That is what that is about. If you get her a mirror, she will turn her attention from you to the bird in the mirror, most likely. It isn't always necessary, but you could try it to see if she likes it.<br>  Single birds need more attention than birds with a cage mate, so make sure she gets it. That is the main thing you need to do above cleaning the cage, providing toys, and keeping fresh food and water. It is a necessary part of her care day to day.|`|ORfqboA9aa	Your female might not be.  You might have a male there in which case the noises that he is making could very well just be him calling out for his mate (you) or him being a show off.<br>  <br>  |`|F5tuHXhAaa	awww, poor birdie probably a mirror, call a local pet store you dont want baby birdies bu if you did get a boy and end up having baby birdies put them on craigslist|`|1evqSw67aa	I have a male cockatiel on its own who doesnt seem to be bothered with other tiels, he is very noisy until my daughter comes in, he then starts singing instead of squawking|`|Zh1Y6lFIaa	If you can't spend time with your bird it's best to get him another bird to hang out with... a mirror makes a bird become extremely possessive and very territorial. It's not the best idea. But smaller birds are very social and need that social interaction from another bird if you aren't giving it. 
Er37MK7zaa	Molting is a completely natural occurrence.  There is really nothing that you need to do to "help" your budgie through it.  His body will handle everything.<br>  <br>  Now, if he is tame and will let you help him remove the pinnies from his head, that is a wonderful bonding exercise.  Good diet is also important to make sure that he has the nutrients needed to grow beautiful new feathers.  Brown rice, whole wheat pasta, couscous, romaine lettuce, carrots, peas, corn, etc are all good offerings.<br>  <br>  He'll also enjoy a spritzing with the water bottle to help soft the covering over the new feathers so that it is easier to remove...but other than that, he's gonna be just fine.|`|922b1183fa14fb3163c08e7ddb8fe645aa	First keep him warm and out of drafts. Moulting is a stressful time for birds and they are vunerable to illness at this time.Providing a tonic (liquid/or seed) would be a good idea. To aid moulting, supply your bird with a bath, or  give your bird a spray with tepid water. Its important to do this early morning so your bird has time to dry thoroughly throughout the day, again, keep him out of any drafts.Some birds get "tetchy" during a moult, if this happens leave your bird in a quiet place and disturb him as little as possible.   |`|6KxBqnstaa	I normally get a seed in a little container at pet store that you mix with their normal food that has extra vitamins and minerals in it while they molt as it takes alot out of them. I also offer a misting of warm water daily to help with the dander and itchy and dryness they get.  |`|AA11039906	As referring to the one above, do NOT use any Kaytee products.

"Kaytee Molting and Conditioning Supplement" would be a good choice.|`|pcg0Qsjwaa	If you go to your local pet shop and ask them for something to help there is vitamins that they use more of during this period.

PUspAGxFaa	i wouldn't recommend riding a horse that has thrown a shoe, it makes them feel uneven. your horse however, does not need shoes. i suggest consulting a Natural hoof care specialist and speaking with them if you are considering going barefoot. they can tell you what to do about the cracks. barefoot horses tend to have less leg and joint problems. any horse can go barefoot. Good Luck!|`|TA4Bvp4Kaa	If his hooves are cracking get a farrier to look and ask him if he needs shoes <br>  If where you ride is rocky yeah he will need shoes,<br>  If you can walk/run barefoot where you ride perfectly fine he wont need them but if you have trouble and things hurt your own feet then yes most Lucky he will need them.<br>  <br>  1. What is the quality of your horse's feet?<br>  If you are among the lucky few your horse has good, solid feet you barely have to give a second thought to. If your horse has good feet, you probably know it. You haven't had to deal with any foot problems to speak of, and your farrier has good things to say. Feet that fall into the above category have solid heels, a thick wall without flares, a cup to the sole, and well-formed frogs that are free of disease. They are usually relatively even in the front and back. Feet like these hold a shoe well but are also very stable when the shoe comes off.<br>  <br>  2.What kind of work is my horse doing, and how often?<br>  <br>  3. What kind of footing is my horse living and working on<br>  If your horse is doing very little work and lives and works on nice, soft, non-abrasive footing, then barefoot is the way to go. However, if your horse lives and rides on rougher footing, or is being worked hard, then you are most likely going to want your horse shod. There's a saying that horse people use when deciding whether or not to shoe. It goes, "If the hoof will stand the abuse of use, then don't shoe it. But if it will not stand the abuse, you have to shoe it.<br>  <br>  Why go barefoot? Going barefoot enhances the overall health of the feet. The hoof wall thickens, the sole depth increases, and the heels expand. There is also increased circulation, movement, and expansion capability. A horse who is not working for some months out of the year—let's say the winter months—will benefit by having his shoes pulled during that period of rest.<br>  <br>  Why shoe your horse?Many horses can't go barefoot because the hoof breaks down faster than it can be replaced. Horses with foot issues, or horses that are in moderate to heavy work year-round, should be shod year-round. Horses with navicular disease should not go barefoot, nor should severely foundered horses. If your horse has splits or cracks wait until the cracks are gone before you have your horse go barefoot. Large breeds with small hooves, like the Quarter Horse, usually can't go without shoes. Nor can Thoroughbreds with paper-thin soles.<br>  <br>  If your horse loses a shoe it will put them off balance and will also make them lame so it is best NOT to ride them if they lose a shoe but you can but it is a bit more risky|`|AA12048299	I would only ride a horse who's thrown a shoe if he happened to do so at the furthest point (from home) of a long trail ride. Otherwise, your'e asking for lameness. Imagine you, walking a long distance wearing one 2" heel, and one foot barefoot. Now imagine it carrying extra weight on your back. Not good, Hmmm?<br>  <br>  What are you doing that's so important that you need to ride a horse who's only got 3 shoes? <br>  <br>  And yes, if your horse's feet are 'cracking a fair bit' then you need shoes. I assume your farrier who trims is suggesting this. You may wish to supplement horse's feed with biotine, DLMethionine, or a commercial hoof supplement. Ask your farrier which he recommends.|`|z3Z7AQWPaa	If a horse "throws a shoe" no you can't ride them. As to why, I'm not 100% sure. I'll check though.<br>  <br>  But if his feet are cracking then it means they are dry. And hooves stay hard and moisturized through diet and exercise without shoes. So bu adding shoes you will likely make it worse. <br>  <br>  You can try some hoof conditioner but there is lots of debate on whether it works or not, as with all hoof dressings, so I'd say check his diet. If he is already barefoot and getting a fair amount of exercise then look to his diet.|`|gmHcanPIaa	Not all cracks are bad. Some just happen. If the horse has a good diet and no known foot problems it's not a big deal. You can help prevent others by adding biotin suppliments to his feed. The big question: is it affecting his soundness? if you notice no difference in his behavior in the stall/paddock such as shifting weight off the foot with the crack (other than the normal resting of a hind foot) or a shorter stride when you are riding him don't worry. The same goes for a thrown shoe - if it's not bothering him and you arn't planning a long trail ride (or a a ride on a rocky trail) or an intense training session not a big deal. Unless you know he is prone to foot tenderness. But you should call the farrier ASAP when they throw a shoe -- but the farrier can't always get back out as quickly as we would like.|`|vmwyOgdRaa	Well, for starters you might try taking your horse to a farrier who might be able to file your horses hooves down if they are overgrown. You should be careful if you ride a horse who has thrown a shoe, since the horses hooves are used to wearing shoes they may be tender and he may get stone bruises and sore feet more easily. If your horse is pastured in a field that has harsh terrain he probably needs shoes. Hope this helps! God Bless!|`|2AOzkBPJaa	If his feet are cracking, it may be that he just needs to be trimmed more frequently, and/or that they aren't being trimmed properly when you do get them done.  They could be too dry also, which you could fix by using a hoof moisturizer a couple of times per week.  In the summer when the paddocks are dry we always hose down the area around the water trough so they have to stand in some mud everyday, to assist with moisture as well.  Before I went to school to become a farrier, it was really hard to get my farrier to come out regularly because i only had one horse and I would usually end up having to trailer her to a friends barn who had lots of horses on the day the farrier was there to even get them done.  She would go too long between trims, and her feet cracked badly.  As soon as I came back from horse shoeing school I gave her a good trim, and put shoes on all four of her feet until her cracks grew to a manageable length, I kept front shoes on for the whole summer for show season, and this fall I pulled those too.  I trim her every four weeks and put a really big roll on the edge of her hooves ( this means I file the bottom edge of the hoof wall so that it is very rounded)  and her cracks are almost completely gone.  Also, the most important factor in hoof care (besides regular visits from a good farrier) is diet!  I put my mare on a high quality feed (she had begun chewing on wood alot, indicative of a nutritional deficiency) with a vitamin and mineral equalizer, and started feeding a  supplement called BMZ, which helped immensely.  <br>  I'd have the farrier out first thing, get his or her opinion, and talk to an equine nutritionist as well (you can sometimes find them at good feed stores), you might need shoes, you might not, regular trims and good food work wonders though, it's healthiest for the horse to go barefoot, you might even want to talk to a barefoot horse trimmer, if you can find a good one, I've heard they can do some pretty amazing stuff.  Good luck!!|`|L4uwRphSaa	i had the same problem and i just dressed his foot with hoof oil and put conditioner on it, horses like their feet to be natural, its the least we can give them since we have taken away everything else they knew! but if it doesn't get better, put shoes for 6-8 weeks then take them off!|`|je09fnkaaa	he probably needs shoes if you ride him on concrete quite a bit, and if he loses a shoe, you do not need to ride him with it off, you either need to have the other shoes removed or have that one added back on.|`|0d22uiaaaa	Any horse that you ride needs shoes on all four feet. Get a ferrier to do his feet or they may tell you no riding until the crack grows out. And no you cannot ride a horse with a shoe missing.|`|svlGcnm0aa	your horse, if his feet are craking, will need shoes.  if your horse loses a shoe, you can ride it, but i really hurts the horse.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	If they are cracking and he is trimmed every 8 weeks, then he needs shoes.  He might only need them in the front but not in the back.<br>  <br>  You can not ride a horse if it has lost a shoe, don't even try.  You can do permanent damage to the hoof if you aren't careful.<br>  <br>  BTW... to the person below me, "natural" hoof trimming is fine for some horses and for many horses it is better than shoes.  However it is not the solution for all horses.  Many horses with hoof troubles can not go without shoes under any circumstances.  An example would be an abused horse (that had slipper hooves at one point), a horse with white line disease, or a foundered horse.  I know plenty of horses that would be dead without shoes, like those white line horses.  My OTTB's feet get all dishy without shoes, and yes I use one of the best farriers in the state.<br>  <br>  Don't trim his hooves yourself, it takes years to get to the point where you can call yourself a professional and unless you are going to be doing it for a living it really isn't worth it.|`|bI7wMCJXaa	If his feet are cracking you should have a farrier out to look at his feet and determine if he needs shoes. I would guess yes.<br>  <br>  If your horse loses a shoe you can still ride on soft surface but it's better to just have a farrier tack the shoe back on.
vVAwFgcJaa	I tried to find if there is copper in this medication but only found this: <br>  <br>  "Toxicity <br>  The Rid·Ich+ combination in this formulation is relatively non-toxic for fishes, but may not be tolerated by certain invertebrates, when used as directed. It may be used for the treatment of "scaleless" fishes. As with any medication, caution should be exercised whenever utilizing a chemical for the first time on a species of fish for which its tolerance is unknown. Always terminate treatments early (with partial water changes or filtration with granular activated carbon) if signs of undue stress occur."<br>  <br>  I would say there is big chance your plants suffer form the medication. Always try to avoid using medication in your tank.|`|stMcVPCMaa	The information that comes with the medication never says what it can do to plants, but I'd be willing to bet it's the medication that's harming it.<br>  There's other ways to treat ich than medication, by increasing temperature and/or salinity in the tank.  I generally raise the temp in my tank to about 90 to 92 degrees and haven't lost a plant yet.<br>  <br>  Check out this website for some excellent information about treating ich.  They don't discuss the temperature method at all, but they do describe the salt method which I have heard also works well. I've never used salt myself because I'm concerned about impact to my plants.  You can also combine salt and high temperature if neither is doing the job alone.<br>  <br>  If you do raise the temperature, just keep in mind that the warmer the water, the less oxygen it can hold, so if your tank is near its stock limit or overstocked then this could be a problem.

Also they do tend to be a one person dog sometimes.|`|ktC40jtXaa	Ya, im pretty sure i was the one who suggested a weimarner ...LOL. I do have a weimaraner, so that does have alot to do with why i suggested it. Anyways, we have winter's here too (canada) and when i cant get out for a walk with him, he keeps him self pretty occupied outside even by himself. I have a few outdoor toys out there and he plays with them for hours at a time by him self. The only thing i would be carefull with is they are pretty energetic dogs, and by accident can knock children over pretty easily. If you do go ahead and decide on a weim, i would make sure you train it to be calm when its around your children. Over all they are just an amazing breed!!!|`|sQOXjKFNaa	Weims are good dogs.

She is good with kids, and if you get a puppy and raise with your children i think the weim would be perfect. Hope is ALWAYS full of energy and there are sometimes she knocks a kid over by accident. I dont walk Hope as much as i should but i do keep her busy. Weims are a very very smart breed, and i find that i am constantly having to out think her. <br>  <br>  I live in arkansas and we just had that recent ice storm. Hope HATES ice she can not stand it. she also hates the rain but i'm told that its just her lol. (I know many other Weim owners). Hope also LOVES the snow. when it snows i have to chase her down to get her to come in. The only problem i have had with her and winter is that she does get cold easily. So if you get a weim, and you live in a place where it snows a lot. you must have a good shelter for them because they do get cold easily. <br>  <br>  I also play hide and seek with hope in my house and she loves it so i believe if you were going to do search and rescue its something a weim could easily do. and they are great hunting dogs. just make sure you look up as much info on the breed as you can. try looking for some rescue groups around your area, if you have one then they can match you up with the perfect weim for you. =) hope this helped. Good Luck|`|746YLjISaa	I am not a weimaraner owner but I know alot about the breed and I also know alot about just about every breed of dog, you have done your home work about getting a dog, but this is my recomendation, go to google and type in animal planet, then when you get to the animal planet site go to the to of the page where it say pets, games,e.t.c then go to pets and find dog breed directoryand click on it, after that take the quiz and it will help you decide what breed of dog to get.
IYd6bw7Gaa	I wouldnt' worry too much.  Dwarf hamsters are very energetic and not so much the cuddly type. Since they have each other for companionship they should be just fine.

But staying in that place to long made him have an accident once and now that it smells like his urine, he may automatically pee there instead of the litter box.|`|HpOvx1Zcaa	OK, lots of stuff going on here.<br>  Not all cats will spray with tail up, it is most common. <br>  Good call on the neuter, it's time and if it is spraying that should nip it.<br>  Make sure the litter boxes are cleaned often and there are at least 1 litter box per cat in the home.

To prevent injury to the snake, it is best done by someone with experience.  However, if you want to try to learn, here is a link to some videos made by one of the leading breeders of corn snakes.  Kathy Love literally wrote the books on keeping corn snakes.  And the sexing methods can  be used on any snake species.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.corn-utopia.com/Corn%20Utopia%20on%20the%20Web/-%20Sexing%20corn%20snakes%20-%20intro%20to%20vid%20clips.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.corn-utopia.com/Corn%20Utopia...</a>|`|yUBHtCIWaa	they can be popped the day they hatch. but if you've never done it, don't try it yourself. you'll do more harm than good and it's not as easy as it looks.|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	The sex of a snake should be of no interest to anybody but another snake. It's not worth the danger of getting the snake popped or probed.|`|90c1c20841cf7509e708485e190f2851aa	Do NOT "pop" your snake. That's all you need is to give it internal injuries because you don't know what you're doing. Take it to a) a vet that knows snakes or b) your local herpetological society, and have it PROBED by someone who KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING.
e0eb82b689e1db392eb51c89982ed115aa	Vaccinations can cause some temporary lethargy and flu like symptoms. Especially if she got a Rabies Vacc. too. I wouldnt let it go 48 hours, it usually should only last 12. Your cat may have developed an allergy to some of the Vaccines. Or in a bad case, they overdosed her. If she isnt feeling well by tonight I'd give them a call and have them check her over. I had a cat that developed allergies to live killed Vaccines. He almost died after his yearly shots. He was 3 and had them before. He vomited, seized, lost bowel control, and had a high temp. We had to get him special vacc's after that.|`|Octzpyyhaa	Have you ever had a reaction to a needle?  I do.  She probably feels flu-like.  When you are sick, you probably arent yourself either.|`|f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	Some cats do feel bad for a day or so after the vaccinations.  If the problem persists into tomorrow or if she gets worse, have the vet take another look. Hope your kitty feels better soon.|`|ejluOCdTaa	I would just keep an eye on her, she is just not feeling well from her shots. My cats do this too. I hope she feels better|`|egN478Bbaa	It is completely normal for them to act this way.  You have to remember that vaccines are actually putting a little bit of the "virus" into the body so they can build immunity to it.  So, they could act a little sick, lethargic, etc.  Make her drink some water.  Bring it to her.  Maybe syringe some into her.  GIve her some nutrical.   Its full of calories and nutrients.  Stick some on the roof of her mouth.   When we get immunizations, we get sore (esp if they gave them to her in her muscle), and we may not feel good and run slight fevers.  Just keep a check on her and if it doesnt go away after a day or so, take her back in.|`|2GVZPDataa	Mild fever, decreased appetite, and depression may be observed for 1-2 days following vaccination, most commonly when modified live vaccines are used. Generally, no treatment is warranted.<br>  Cats vaccinated with some Chlamydia vaccines may show weakness, lethargy, lameness, fever, and loss of appetite for 1-3 weeks after vaccination. In some instances, medications such as corticosteroids may be used to help alleviate the symptoms.<br>  Pain, swelling, redness, and irritation can occur at the injection site. These effects generally occur within 30 minutes to 1 week of the vaccination. If the signs persist, or are severe, contact your veterinarian.Occasionally, abscesses can form at the injection site. These abscesses are generally not caused by infection, but by the body's over-reaction to the vaccine.<br>  A small, painless swelling sometimes develops at the site of a recent vaccination. This should disappear in several weeks. If it persists, however, it could mean it is developing into a sarcoma and should be checked by your veterinarian. The Vaccine-Associated Feline Sarcoma Task Force advises the warning signs for a vaccine-related fibrosarcoma are:<br>  A lump persists for more than three months after vaccination.<br>   It is larger than two centimeters in diameter (2.5 centimeters = 1 inch).<br>   One month after vaccination it is still increasing in size.<br>  you have any more question feel free to email me at blueskys_mon@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  |`|5dba8634210b0ec9af7a3e99d6ffe86caa	This is normal apparently.  I wish the vet had warned me when I got mine vaccinated as I was very worried and like than, when I phoned the vet they said it was normal.  She was ok after a day or so but if your cat is no better tomorrow get back on to the vet.|`|xM912JfXaa	if were me i would get a second opinion. when my cats had surgery they did not act like themselves either. so get a scenod opinion.|`|nDjTp1tCaa	i had a rat just like that but the next day she died so maybe that is why she is old or so, maybe she needs a shot|`|AA11352641	Sometimes they will be sore from the injection (the rabies especially, that is given in the muscle), and feel under the weather. I would go by the vet's recommendation, but if it extends beyond that I would take her in to be checked. |`|eHUXcYZhaa	Using the rest room!!! ha ha clever cat! LOL<br>  It is perfectly normal. If she is no better in a couple of days then call your vet.   
o6LrQTw6aa	Heels down, look up ( you may bot have been looking down but it looked like it)<br>  <br>  The biggest thing I saw was the leg and your instability after the jump. You leg moves as you jump and it should stay steady. When it moves your body becomes unbalanced and you hunch a bit and get wobbly after the fence.<br>  <br>  Work on your leg and heels and then once you've gotten that steady work on keeping your shoulders  back and you back straight. (think of a your spine being a plank of wood, you don't curve your back, you bend at the hips. Once your leg become solid you will have better balance over the fence|`|8rVodF9vaa	being brutally honest, you should not be jumping anything more than crosspoles. From what I could see, you're hanging on for dear life while your horse packs you around - he deserves an award for sainthood, by the way. <br>  <br>  I guess if you just want to look prettier - put your heels DOWN, lift your chin up, stick your chest out. <br>  <br>  If you want to learn how to ride, and not just be a passenger, take your stirrups off for 6 months. Go back to basics. Maybe get a new trainer - what you are doing is not safe, and I am honestly scared for you. Good luck.|`|UFhrD7DWaa	Your posture is not good. You need to sit up and put your' heels down.Your jumping is not that great and I think that you are probably jumping way to high for your level or experience. try bringing the jumps down  and working on your flat.Honestly if your trainer is letting you jump that high while looking like that they obviously don't know what they are doing.|`|uNIHqmH8aa	All right, it was a bit hard to see, and it took many replays, but this is what I got out of each video I watched:<br>  <br>  Jumping 3'3: Your leg position is pretty good- once you recover. Keep it good through the entire ride. It seems to be loose over the jump. You fall forward after the jump, this is because your legs are not tight enough and your shoulders are hunched over. It is a bad habit that many have, and many are trying to break! (that includes me!!) Always be thinking about that!! I can't see your hands at all, so I can't give you any tips there. The only other thing I can tell you, is that the horse was on the wrong lead.<br>  <br>  Almost Falling Off: Again, you didn't have any leg! That refusal happened before you even took the first jump because you had no leg.  It also looks like you were looking at the jump, another bad habit that many have!! If you look at the jump you can screw with the horse's distance. <br>  <br>  Jumping 3'6: Same situation as above, when did that rail come down? Before the first jump!! Leg!! haha, a lot of people do this, it is a very common problem with hunter/jumpers.<br>  <br>  Cantering: Hands should be higher, reins shorter from what I can see, if you don't have contact with the horse at all times, your canter will fall apart as it did. Your horse broke for this reason and...the lack of leg that you had. You should be able to completely control your horse with your legs. Hands are only for guidance!!<br>  <br>  DISCLAIMER: This is How I personally was taught!! You should always listen to your trainer over me as 1) I have never met you and 2) I have never met your horse.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!! Happy Riding!!<br>  -Nov<br>  <br>  EDIT: Reflections on Riding and Jumping, Winning Techniques for Serious Riders by William Steinkraus is something you should definatly read. Give it to your trainer as well.
qHtxa2nEaa	do not handle the tarantula during or after a molt, until it begins to accept food.  <br>  <br>  Fro the next several days the exoskeleton hardens and the chitin and slerotin experience a sort of tanning process whereby the individual molecules become cross-linked.  the concentration of the cross-links determines the strength and hardness of the resulting part ot the exoskeleton.  during this time, the tarantula will lie flat with its legs stretched as far as possible to take full advantage of its temporary size as possible.  the lining og the mouth, pharynx, and pumping stomach are also shed, and the tarantula will not eat until these are also hardened.  this may take up to a week of more.  when the spider progresses from postmold to intermolt is actually a smooth transition, and no hard and fast indication define the exact instant of changeover, for our purpose it is signaled when food is again accepted.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped you with this, i have breed and raised tarantulas for 5 years<br>  <br>  tosha|`|1Dxjg7lMaa	Just leave him for a while, he will be very hungry in a few day's after he has sloughed, make sure there is lots of live food in the house he is in, keep it moist in there and remove the other skin when he starts to move. It is a very traumatic for a Tarantula to slough and he will need feeding up.|`|q6J4IpjBaa	wait three days to give him time to harden his exoskeleton then you can feed him. If you don't wait his prey will bite him and it will be very uncomfortable and he could die.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  PrettyKitty
zakbXGK6aa	Yes.  Many birds love cheese and yogurt.<br>  <br>  A general guideline is, if a food is healthy for a human, it is healthy for your bird. Birds enjoy spaghetti or a bit of chicken. Hard boiled egg is often a big hit. Almonds, walnuts or other nuts are fine in small quantities. Monkey chow is a tasty treat and an excellent source of protein for birds. It is available at most pet stores. Cuttlebone and mineral blocks are a good source of calcium.|`|20ccea7fa7f3ddbfe3a11c22cf8097ddaa	Yes as long as it isn't loaded with sugar. Try to get the kind that has the live cultures in it or it may even say probiotic on it. This helps balance the digestive system with healthy bacteria and is often recommended after antibiotics have been administered . The yogurt with fruit already in it has a lot of sugar in it so buy plain and add your own fruit . If you dont like the plain just buy it for your bird and freeze the rest in small amounts for later. Once or twice a week in small amounts is fine.|`|kTc3bfrRaa	no problem!!|`|pcg0Qsjwaa	Personally I give my greys cheese 1ce a week and they love it and it hasn't done them any harm. Don't give it more that a tsp.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Can give little amounts now and then. Low fat and unflavored is the best of course. |`|HHFmG9wLaa	i think it is ok if your not giving her allot of it.
wpRDPuzJaa	 Answer is Yes. You can be allergic to your hamster and rabbits. When it comes to hamsters, sometimes if you are interacting with them for long periods of time, you will start to react badly towards them, even though they have such little fur. Stuffy nose, "itchy eyes, sneezing, runny nose, persistent cough, shortness of breath, wheezing", those are all also signs of the allergic reaction. I put that one part in quotations because i got if off a website which i will put down for you to look at if you want. <br>  <br>  Rabbits, you can also be allergic too. "People generally are more allergic to hamsters than cats" ( another quote from the next website i will give you) , so its not uncommon at all. Hamsters clean themselves just like cats do, but when they do some of it sticks in their mouth and most of the time floats its way out into your air when it can dry. But bad thing is that if they digest their hair, they can produce a hairball like cats do, but they cant puke it up like cats can, so it just collects inside. So if you got one, especially durin its shedding season and also if u aren allergic to it, it needs to be brushed pretty daily, so this doesn happen. The next website is another website that talks a great deal about rabbits and how to take care of them and what to do if your interested. So i hope i answered your question :-)|`|eaFjiX6Daa	Get rid of them! Sorry but if you even suspect you are I recommend that. I have a allergy to all rodents. I got them before I knew and it made my asthma like ten times worse. I got rid of them and saw an allergist. If you're not sure try seeing an allergist too.|`|d0EyXi6paa	yes, you could be allergic them<br>  <br>  do  ufeel itchy? stuffying/ runny nose is a sign<br>  <br>  im allergic to animals as their fur makes me itch<br>  <br>  theres all kind of types|`|Jz1EUDfcaa	yea u can be allergic to anything actually,<br>  but i would go to the doc and schedule an appointment with an allergist.<br>  |`|jcj8ID7Caa	yes you can anyone could be allergic to anything.|`|eufjuW55aa	you are.<br>  thats how i get when im around hamsters & rabbits & cats & anything that has that type of fur. |`|BHQst5jRaa	i THINK its possible to be allergic to animals.|`|nXJTGLzQaa	The short answer is:  Yes.<br>  The long answer is:  You sure can.|`|zhcXtKi2aa	Yes! Hamsters and rabbits both have dander. A lot of people are allergic to dander.|`|LGqEegLYaa	There is a possibility that you are allergic to them...|`|jPlMOrpKaa	yes you could be allergic to them!|`|lU8e0VQFaa	If there's enough rabbit hair flying I can have an allergy attack, but I've never had a problem with hamsters. It could also be something else, have you brought anything else new into your house?|`|nmercOm7aa	You can be allergic to just about anything. This includes small animals.<br>  You could be allergic to the bedding or hay that you use. <br>  <br>  You could try using a different bedding, if you are using wood shavings, try a soft bedding like Carefresh. For hay, use hay cubes or get someone else to handle the hay.<br>  If the switch doesn't work, get tested for allergies. <br>  You can take some allergy medication to help with the symptoms. |`|kK4xt7cAaa	yes ypure allergic to them... hang them...|`|cu8jrdCmaa	Yes- its called pet dander|`|FEhmNTL2aa	Yes.|`|lcn62prPaa	YES 
y31mee4Faa	Hi, hopefully things have quieted down around your house.<br>  <br>  First of all, Beth P. is right about what she said.  The flower or cornstarch did its job didn't it?<br>  <br>  Whenever things like this happen, you need to be calm because when you are upset, your pets get upset too.<br>  <br>  Next, the injury to your grey is really not as bad as it looks or you may think it is.  Yes, blood injuries are always a worrisome experience, but healthy birds can handle blood loss much better than we mammals can.<br>  <br>  Actually for healthy active birds, they can recover from up to a 30% loss of their blood volume without little consequence.<br>  <br>  Since you don't have an avian vet nearby, you can use tissue adhesives, like liquid bandaid, to seal the tip of your grey's beak.  The only thing is, is that you need to be real careful about not getting any of the glue in their mouth or on their eyelids.<br>  <br>  Your feathered friend will have a sore beak for a while because there are nerve endings near the tip of his beak, so you will need to be feeding cooked oatmeal, grits, farina (cream of wheat), mashed potatoes, cooked sweet potatoes, cooked pasta or anything else that is soft & he will eat.<br>  <br>  Once the soreness goes away, he should start eating normally again.  The beak will heal itself since it is like your finger nails and is always growing, so you don't need to worry about putting the tip back on, it would just fall off again in 2-4 weeks or sooner.<br>  <br>  He may still need to see a vet since you need to find out why he fell if he did it for no apparent reason.<br>  <br>  Even though you are going to want to give him a lot of attention because of the injury, resist that temptation so that he doesn't think that's how it is going to be from now on...tomorrow, with the exception of carefully cleaning the beak tip & using the liquid bandaid, everything should return to normal, other than you having to fix soft foods for him.  If he's on a pelleted diet, you can crush the pellets & mix the powder with some of his favorite juice also.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|RVicFEyFaa	Emergency vet...most have bird doctors|`|6KxBqnstaa	Ok calm down and go get some flour or cornstarch and apply with slight pressure to the beak area. it should work. Keep the bird calm as if he is not his blood pressure goes up and he bleeds more. Call a avian vet and get advice and if have to bring in may have to drive out of your way. I would try the flour and or cornstarch with pressure first. Dont wipe after apply it as it will disturb the clot. Then feed him soft food for a few days and limit water for first few hours until clot forms. Watch it carefully. He can bleed to death from this injury. You can keep applying more flour to wound. I would not use septic or quick stop as it may damage tissue. He may need cauterizing. Good luck.|`|7a0b8d7dd5636ea72eeaaf763882e180aa	you need to find the nearest emergency vet (even if its going to take 3 hours to get there) and take him imediatly...no waiting around no "theres none neer us" better to drive 3 hours trying to save him than sit around at home hoping for some miracle that isnt comming.<br>  <br>  if you dont he will die...<br>  since this is an absolute emergency take some corn startch and dip the beak in it, this will help coagulate/slow the bleeding but its not a fix and is just a "while we drive to the vet" solution<br>  <br>  there is no way for You to stop the bleeding, the bird will need emergency surgery to stop the bleeding and will ened special care for the shock<br>  <br>  the good news is if you get him there fast, he can survive and will be able to function fine with only part of the beak.|`|AA11039906	Put baking flour on the tip of the beak.

In the meantime put cornstarch on his beak to stop the bleeding, but still take him to the vet.|`|JJx2QrIYaa	do you really think you can get an answer for somethin like that. get in the car or on the bus or on the plane and go to a vet. it dont have to be no avian vet dont let some people confuse you.<br>  really that is nothing to sit around and wait for the answers. Unless you wanna lose the bird then just sit around the house and wait for it to bleed out. :((((((((((((((|`|hwFPIT1Kaa	LOL why wait for a answer put preshur to the wound and take  him to a vet i am almost shur i will need a to have a fake beak  to rplace his boken part they will give hi ssomething like acap or sumething but anyways you should go te the VET! |`|nVnbfV19aa	put pressure on it, or some cream of tartar to stop the bleeding, or at least slow it down. that's what i put on a dogs toe nail when i cut it to short. if he keeps bleeding i would take him to the vet. sorry:(

What happened to this bird to cause this loss?<br>  <br>  Under most conditions your bird may be doomed,  I have heard of prosthesis made for birds with this condition but cost is in the thousands,  was this from poor nutrition?<br>  <br>  You need to be the feeder, baby foods are best at this point.|`|YOFfOMtJaa	iam so sorry 2 hear this!! ur bird is clearly suffering from an illness of some form. this is NOT normal!! its is very likely he will not survive but take him 2 the vet and he can be put 2 sleep if necessary as oppose 2 starving.

Brown and blue are the average cere colors for males and females (brown meaning female, blue meaning male) unless you have babies, and or harlequines, latinos, albinos, or pieds (colors), in which case the cere will remain that baby pink, more blue/purple for the male, more white/faded for the female.<br>  If you bird's cere has turned green, I would definantly get it checked out by your local avian specialist/vet. It might be serious. I've never heard of it, nor seen it. So I would be cautious. If it is simply a green shade of blue, I wouldn't worry.

DO NOT WAIT FOR ANSWERS AS BY WAITING MAY PROVE TOO LATE. NEVER EVER GIVE HUMAN  MEDICATION TO A DOG WITHOUT YOUR OWN VETS ADVICE.<br>  <br>  Rodenticides - XXX   Top<br>  <br>  XXX - Emergency! XX - Highly Dangerous X - Dangerous<br>  <br>  Poisons intended to kill rats, mice, gophers, moles and other mammalian pests are among the most common and deadly of small animal toxins. Since rodent and other pests and our companion animal dogs and cats are all mammals, it follows that substances highly poisonous to the pests would be just as lethal to our pets, and indeed that is the case. In the 1990 AAPCC report, 8% of all non-drug toxin exposures resulted from rodenticides and of 425 fatalities, 60 (14%) of deaths were subsequent to these poisons. Commonly, owners have all but forgotten the old rat poison in the garage cabinet until it gets knocked onto the ground and the dog has eaten it. Or on farms or stables, rat poison is left in what seems like a safe place to attract only the rats and then the empty chewed container is seen outside the doghouse. It cannot be too highly stressed that rodenticides are highly toxic and any such poisons designed to kill small mammals need to be carefully contained in closed metal cabinets or high on stable shelving. The poisons usually come in flimsy cardboard containers and any dog, puppy or cat can chew through the container to get at the bait. Unfortunately, every year far too many do just that.<br>  <br>  Rodenticides are classified according to both their basic ingredient compounds and by how they act on their target. These categories include: Anti-coagulant rodenticides, cholecalciferol, strychnine, zinc phosphide, bromethalin, compound 1080 and more. The most common rodenticide poisoning seen in veterinary practice is that of the anti-coagulant rodenticides. These poisons - with ingredient names like warfarin, fumarin, diphacinone, bromadiolone - act by interfering with the animal's ability to utilize Vitamin K. One of they key roles of Vitamin K is in the production of coagulation factors in the body which cause blood to clot when necessary. Although we are not aware of it, normal physiological processes require blood to clot many times a day in our bodies and that of our pets. Without the necessary coagulation factors, normal minor bleeding in the body goes unchecked which, without treatment, becomes major bleeding, with blood loss anemia, hemorrhage and death resulting. With most anti-coagulant rodenticides, signs are not seen until 3-5 days after the pet has ingested the poison. Clinical signs include weakness, difficult breathing, pale mucous membranes, and bleeding from the nose.<br>  <br>  Other types of rodenticides have different mechanisms of action with some (i.e., strychnine and bromethalin) causing neurological signs such as incoordination, seizures and others cardiac failure (i.e., cholecalciferol). If accidental ingestion of rat poison is suspected, contact your veterinary clinic immediately, even if your dog or cat is showing no obvious signs of being ill. Be sure, if possible, to bring the poison container in to the clinic in order to determine the specific toxin and provide the best treatment. Early recognition is critical as some poisons, particularly the anti-coagulant rodenticides, can be successfully treated if the poisoning is caught early and treated appropriately.
nhlb2ycVaa	I have two Westies and I would love to answer any questions you have about them!<br>  <br>  My Westies don't mind being left home alone for extended periods.  As a breed they tend to require a lot of sleep, so while we are gone they just sleep!<br>  Both of mine are good about being quiet during the day.  But that depends on if they are crated or if they are left to roam free.  If they have the ability to look out windows they might tend to bark more.<br>    <br>  Westies love to den!  So both of mine LOVE their crates, they go in often on their own to relax and play.  They hide their toys and treats in there so you might want to consider a crate for them.<br>  <br>  From the research Ive done it looks like Westies and Carin terriers are originally from the same litters, they would just separate them by color at birth and call the white ones West Highland Terriers.  Now a true Westie should have 3-4 generations of "Westie" blood.  I imagine they have similar temperaments for this reason.<br>  <br>  If you have any questions please feel free to reach out to me!|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Check the national KC parent sites or specialty rescue sites for these dogs- they will tell you up front what the behavior is like. Any breed of dog can be left long enough for you to go to school or work.  It just depends on the personality of the dog and how it is trained/socialized.  Terriers as a rule, have tons of attitude and are stubborn, so that is a consideration for you as well.|`|8khZ0fJZaa	Depends, but probably not since it is a small dog with small bladder and more prone to depression and anxiety from being alone.|`|Mkbtj7bGaa	WHWT were just BAD colored Cairn until somebody decided(yeah,I know but can't recall who) that they were shot less often by his nitwit hunting companions.<br>  <br>   Your situation is *NOT* breed related!!!<br>  ALL/ANY dog must be TRAINED!<br>  ALL dogs must be confined so be SAFE & keep the house & contents from being destroyed.<br>  <br>  NO dogs needs to"amuse it self"!<br>  Crate it & leave & it will SLEEP.<br>  If you can't understand the basics,don't get *any* dog.<br>  |`|EL5KhR6Baa	I have a westie and they are great. Mine sleeps when I go out. They can be trained not to bark as they are very clever dogs. Make sure you have time to groom and walk him though. My friend also owns one and both of ours both love watching tv! They are little characters and lovely to own! <br>  <br>  Spaniels are lovely too. Don't bark very much, good companions, love to sleep and soo cuddly and soppy!<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!!|`|pxgLnHo8aa	well westies need alot of grooming since their hair is thinner than cairn terriers, who only need a bath every 2 weeks. From my point of view any terrier will give you company, cairn terriers will LOVE you to death. I have one and he's 5 years old. I love him alot. and Cairns dont bark to amuse themselves. Their also easy to train, because i didnt even train my dog and he'll go to the back door when he has to go to the bathroom, but the only reason why is that when he was smaller and inside all the time, he used the bathroom, and he was put in his kennel imediatly. So you just have to lay down the rules for them. They'll get it eventually. But if your going to be gone that long you NEED to train them, unless you have a backyard. If you want it to stay inside, get some puppy pads and put it in different areas. Cairns are very loyal, like to sniff (dont let them mark their territory in your house so they wont have a scent anywhere) and very funny dogs. I swear you will love your cairn from the start. But if you want to get a westie go ahead, their behavior is kind of similar but their more calm. 
odHnfpBTaa	Try to tape the incidents with your phone. Without evidence it will be your word against hers and I'm sure that ***** knows how to turn on the tears when the police arrive. I feel real bad for the baby because your sister isn't even capable of taking care of a dog properly. Hitting the dog and trapping it under a milk crate are both considered cruelty to animals. Lisa should be taught a lesson. Get evidence and call the police on her. Keep an eye on that baby too please.|`|CGpbZCX2aa	I suggest you get in contact with the RSPCA or another animal welfare group... i'm shocked, she shouldnt have a pet if she's going to treat it like that, she might really hurt it one day.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|szuzWoVXaa	I think so, its a pretty serious offense you can call police or animal control|`|SNRWVFcfaa	I don't know your sister or what kind of relationship you guys have... But I will say this, never value animals over people.  <br>  <br>  It sounds like your sister is having a hard time and that she needs more help than the dog.  I hope you've been helping her out with the new baby.  I'm a mom and I remember needing all the help I could get!<br>  <br>  As far as the puppy goes, before you call animal control and get the law involved, offer to take the puppy for a while.  No, she shouldn't have taken on the responsibility but you don't need to rush in and call the cops on her.  <br>  <br>  Or how about this novel idea... TALK TO HER!  About what she's doing and how that's not how you treat a dog.  About how you are willing to help potty train since she is also caring for an infant right now.  <br>  <br>  I'd say If that fails, then call animal control.  Best of luck and hope all turns out for the best!|`|XTqGABx3aa	Yes this is defiantly animal abuse, please stop it, report it to the RSPCA or your local agency if your not in the UK. Its really sad and upsetting to read this story and you are the only one to stop it, even though she is your sister you need to stop it. Talk to her first about it then if she gets mad at you then just say you wanted to talk to her and give her a chance before you report her please do something and change the puppies life for the better. I hope you get things sorted out.|`|m82BNuPeaa	dude this is abuse it is one thing to yell at it to teach it not to but to excessivly do life yelling at it for getting up thats wrong and it is abuse to lick it up in a milk crate is illegal it can make the animal sick if it is not let out because the feces (dog poop) isn't cleaned up it will make the dog ill and and a dog has to move. call  the locale humane society and report this if you don't know the number call the none-emergency police number and they will inform the correct people for you and the animal will be taken care of like it should be if you want to learn more about it watch the animal planet and look for animal cops on it it will tell you about diffrent animal abuse and how it effects the animals. look up the laws for ur town if you want a more defined way of knowing|`|rrFpOA8Caa	I believe that is far beyond teaching the puppy a lesson! I agree that you should talk to your sister first, and tell her that you dont think what she is doing is right. If she continues to hurt the puppy, you need to call ASPCA. You can look the nubmer up online of in a phone book for the local number, or call the non-emergancy police number to find it out. Like the other guy said, try watching Animal Cops on Animal Planet, maby even with your sister (just so she gets the idea). Always follow your instincts!!!!|`|stTUqBM6aa	Yes it is animal abuse. I was quite upset to read this story, and find it very sad that your sister thinks this way. I think you should talk to her and try to make her realise how cruel she is with the puppy. There are other ways for an animal to respect you and that doesn't include violence but care and love!!Show her that she can be firm with it without shouting or being violent. If she doesn't want this puppy anymore, if she got it without thinking of what it implied(=patience) then it is best for her to give it to s.o or to a charity who will find good owners for it.<br>   <br>  If she doesn't realise she is cruel and don't think what she does is wrong then I think you should contact the RSPCA (tel 0300 1234 999), or any other pet charity (which will be happy to advise you and help you protect the pup)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>   |`|AA12340941	I don't understand why your sister got a dog if she was going to treat it this way.  She should give it up and give it to someone who will truely show it love not what she is doing.  Its a shame if you ask me and you can tell her I said that!  |`|VMY7No0eaa	I would say this is a pretty harsh case of abuse.<br>  If you have spca in your area call them.<br>  I would TRY to talk her out of the dog... and then you possibly can rehome it...<br>  THIS IS A REAL INDICATOR of how she is going to treat her child too.<br>  <br>  So I would talk to her and see if she will give up the dog... if she won't I would call someon.<br>  you don't say where you are but if you do someone will know.|`|qHtxa2nEaa	i hate to tell you but yes this is not good for the dog, she needs to find it a better home and someone who will love and take care of her properly. <br>  <br>  you should call your local aspca or animal abuse center and please get the dog out of that involvement do it for the dog she/he needs love before she is permanently scared.  Make sure not to call a shelter that kills animal they are not the place where you want to put a puppy just starting at life.  you either do it or tell you sis to do it for the dog......|`|f96ecf10164e7f3a9da36cca8ac9ce14aa	It's animal abuse. Something needs to be done. You don't necessarily need proof, if you call the RSPCA and they go out to investigate, they'll be able to tell if the dog has been abused, and from the sounds of it, its been abused all its life.|`|1Dxjg7lMaa	Call the RSPCA, your sis is being very cruel, I would also tell your sis what you are going to do would she do that to her new baby ? Save that puppy !|`|wWdQSuCbaa	That is abuse! Thats pretty mean there.  Your sister might be trying to get her anger out on the dog, which is not right.<br>  Tell someone you can trust, get the dogs off her hands!
z5N0fQITaa	animals die, no one is guaranteed to live<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  mark k|`|EJpiaCMQaa	In my opinion, your parakeet may already have been sick.  Birds tend to hide their illnesses until its too late.  You would only know for sure what she died of if you took Sam to the vet for a necropsy.  Are you sure she didn't show any symptoms of illness like sleeping alot, sneezing, laying on the floor alot, limping on one foot, being puffed up all the time, or unusual looking stools?  Just some advice, I like keeping my parakeets in separate cages so they don't fight.  You didn't mention any wounds on Sam, but if Sam and the other bird were fighting, this could've stressed Sam out.  I really don't know what your bird died of and I'm sorry to hear about your loss.  I've owned parakeets for the past 15 years.  |`|dOQ8ztVdaa	She could have been sick. Birds hide their illnesses and usually do not show signs until they are very sick. This is something they have to do  in  the wild because the other birds will attack and  kill a sick bird in order  to  protect the flock. <br>  that may have been why the other bird was picking on her.  You need to keep a close eye on the other bird and watch for changes in  eating habits  and the appearance of her poop.  that is often where you will see the first signs of  illness.  A change in color or being runnier than usual etc can indicate a problem.<br>  Good Luck and sorry about the loss of Sam.|`|6KxBqnstaa	Bird may have been sick or maybe he did pick on her worse than you think when you were not around. Hard to tell. And yes bleach is toxic to use around birds unless it is the perfect concentration with water. If going to clean the cage with bleach and water mix it properly rinse well and let it air dry. Or just get another cage. Also make sure nothing is being used in house that could be dangerous to birds. maybe a vet visit should be in store for other bird. The male could have killed the female over territorial issues which they sometimes do. Sorry for your loss. |`|AA11039906	Birds do not show signs of illness until it is too late. It is most likely that your bird has caught an illness from the other bird. :( <br>  <br>  If her bird was older and your bird was younger, it is more susceptible to disease. <br>  <br>  If you do decide to get another bird, then before adding in new birds, quarantine them in separate rooms for a minimum of 40 days.<br>  <br>  Sorry!<br>  <br>  ~Heather |`|FJZIvANFaa	Birds hide their illnesses so u dont know when they are ill <br>  she mite off caught something <br>  or she mite off bin startled by something outside <br>  <br>  Sorry 2 hear that =[ <br>  <br>  xoxox american pitbull xoxox|`|pis2wCsdaa	As the others have said, your bird was probably already sick. There is another answer though, if your bird was an acrobat, he may have fallen and broken his neck. I had this happen to a bird once.<br>  <br>  Also, if you do get another budgie, be sure to not only quarantine but bleach and wash the cage throughly. I would also buy new toys and perches just to be safe.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my budgie last week.

icxax4braa	Both Frontline and Advantage are suitable for 8 week old pups.  The vet can also provide you with other options like capstar that are safe for pups that young.  |`|OnZDg0AEaa	hi,<br>  <br>  Few dog owners are fortunate enough to avoid an eventual run-in with fleas, the most common dog parasites. Even with regular bathing and grooming, the tireless critters can find their way to the tender flesh of unsuspecting dogs (and dog owners).

Try a flea comb. Requires a little more work, but in the end, you'll have your pup flea free.<br>  <br>  Also, vacuum really well and treat your carpet and yards, so he doesn't just get them again.|`|VZ3KoJr2aa	oatmeal flea removing shampoo! I used it on my 6 week old puppy-groomer at shop said it was ok but start with the head and work your way to the tail.|`|ljspMjGuaa	Go to your vet and buy either frontline or advantage.  Flea and tick shampoos do nothing for control of the pests and only provides relief for a very short period of time.  If it says not to use the product until the pup is 12 weeks old, then follow the directions!    <br>  Do not buy cheap pet store or grocery store products as they may be more harmful than good.

La única enfermedad que los gatos pueden causar es la toxioplasmosis, pero no es grave, se puede curar. No existen vacunas contra ella. Solo debes tener a tu mascota en buenas condiciones, darle comida adecuada y mantener aseado el lugar donde la misma se encuentra . Debes en cuando hay que sacudir el lugar donde duerme .

Buena suerte !|`|U1JNEIHKaa	Lo q puede causarte infertilidad es el parasito toxoplasma q tienen los gatos, pero para q esto suceda se necesita: Efectivamente los gatos normalmente eliminan en sus heces el parasito toxoplasma pero solo los huevecillos de este parasito q NO son la fase q infecta, para q sea infectante y afecte a una persona necesita: ser defecado por el gato durar las 24 hrs en el medio ambiente con las condiciones de humedad y temperatura adecuada para q pase a la sigiente fase y despues ser ingerido por un huesped como los ratones para desarrollar la fase infectante, y q ese raton sea ingerido por un gato, q despues el gato entre a tu casa, q estes embarazada, q el gato defeque y q con las manos tomes el excremento y despues vayas y te comas un taco sin haberte lavado las manos. Nada facil verdad??<br>  <br>  En lugar de q el raton se lo coma un gato, este raton puede defecar en establos donde se crien vacas y borregos de carne para consumo humano, el excremento contamina el alimento q le dan a los animales y esos animales nos los podemos llegar a comer. esta forma de infeccion para toxoplasmosis es mas facil q contagiarse de un gato. Al igual q si riegan con agua contaminada las verduras y nos las comemos, podemos contraer toxoplasmosis mas facil q de un gato.<br>  Es decir q mas facil te infectas de toxoplasma por comerte unos tacos en el puesto de la esquina a q te infecte un gato.<br>  <br>  Asi q ningun gato es peligroso a menos q tenga un due?o irresponsable q nunca lo desparasite y q ademas no tenga higiene.

Some days they don't mind, other times they try to snap at my fingers.<br>  Another one has never came around and refuses to be held or touched without putting up a fight.  He kicks and hisses and snaps at anything.  It's just how he is.<br>  And another one of mine has never tried to bite me.<br>  <br>  But if it's a tortoise, some are mean but it's not very often.<br>  Try to soak him/her in warm (NOT HOT) water for a few minutes every day and that should lessen his stress and hopefully make it come around to being more friendly.<br>  Also, the water..make sure it's NOT TOO DEEP.  Tortoises can drown if it's too deep.<br>  I suggest filling a small bowl (or deep plate/dish) up and having the water touched just before it gets to their neck.  So if it is too deep they just extend their neck a little and all is well.<br>  <br>  But if it's a water turtle, some come around, some don't.  Just keep your fingers clear away from its jaws.|`|7z6BWoESaa	I think it just depends on the temperment of the individual turtle, I know that handling them alot when they are little is supposed to help but we were crazy for ours when it was young played and handled it alot, and still try to but he dont wanna be bothered on some days and snaps at us, some days he wont. we try to remember to feed him first. that makes him a little more docile he is almost 6 years with us and measures about 7 or eight inches across. good luck!
faa23f4368704769d71cc29e72525163aa	Incredible!!

R7Yjo9xSaa	the 1 inch per gallon rule doesn't apply to all fish... it depends on the temperament of your fish and if they have enough territory in the tank.. we have a 75 gallon tank and we don't use the inch per gallon we actually have an "understocked tank" we want to make sure our fish don't fight and have enough swimming room in the tank and places to hide and make caves... <br>  i think you would be ok to add some more though just make sure everyone is happy|`|f8RBtCVAaa	this is a good way u see i have a 20 gallon to with 21 fish and 4 big gold snails. and the total length of fish is about 60in. of fish. mine are all fine and all u need to do if u over stock your tank is to do weekly water changes. so u can add just a little bit more fish and be all right as long as u do 30% weekly water changes. mine i put all off them in a tank that was set up after only 4 days and tis week will be the 5th week that they stayed alive. what i am saying is if u break the rules that dose not mean for fish will die. and lastly i would say add all 4 fish maybe 2 more corrys. because they like to be in schools of 6|`|vVAwFgcJaa	that's right, school fish likes to be kept in school.

I have a male and two females (all spayed/neutered) and the two girls often have a spat.  It's never serious.  Cats in particular are jealous creatures.  I know some get along great, but in my personal experience, the girls just tolerate each other and never really have a friendship.  Most of the time mine ignore each other, but once in a while, for no apparent reason, tails are fluffed, there's hissing and spitting and swatting, and once in a while a couple tufts of fur go flying.  Like yours, my boy usually just sits there and watches.  I just stamp my foot or use the water bottle if things get a little out of hand, but most of the time it's over with in 10 seconds anyway.  My male kitty is young, though--just turned a year old, and he regularly got trounced by both of the girls.  Now that he's as big as they are he can hold his own.

AQsiugSpaa	In my opinion declawing a cat at any age is neither fair or humane. Read a highly knowledgeable and respected vet's web site on the subject, which offers alternatives and also gives all the facts.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.declawing.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.declawing.com/</a><br>  <br>  Many people don't realise that declawing is not just removing the claw. It is actually amputation of the last digit on the paws. It is an extremely painful procedure, with results that often are disfiguring, remove a cat's first line of defense ( should they get out and need them) and also skews their balance. Many cats who are declawed also develop neurotic habits, such as chewing, biting and becoming depressed.<br>  <br>  You have received some excellent answers so I won't belabor the procedure or its cruelty, but let me add that I adopted a kitty a long time ago who had been declawed, who chewed up all my lampshades, windowshades and was unwilling for me to touch her paws. I suspect those were the reasons she was surrendered for adoption.<br>  <br>  Cat scratching posts that really work have to be high enough for a cat to be able to stretch out their entire body. The texture of the covering is most important. If it is carpeted it is basically useless. Cats far prefer sisal covered textures ( they feel like rough rope) and cardboard scratching devices which are really attractive to cats.<br>  <br>  If it were my cat I would cover the furniture with slip covers, or put plastic covers on them. Cats hate the texture of plastic on their paws. Contact a cat behaviorist to help you train your kitty. Learn to clip your cat's claws. All of these alternatives can work if you are consistent and make them attractive to your kitty. Rub your scratching posts with catnip.<br>  <br>  Trust me, a declawed cat is not a happy kitty. <br>  <br>  Folks who have been giving de-claw options and sharing the real deal about the surgery have saved many cats from declawing. Many people have "seen the light" and are using other alternatives very successfully. Perhaps you might ask another question for those people to respond and help you through this issue.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps and do reconsider,please. Read the vet's website and all the information she provides.<br>  <br>  Troublesniffer<br>  Owned by cats for over 40 years<br>  My furniture is intact and pristine.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	You have so many answers all l can say l am in one of the countries that declawing is banned.You can trim the nails every 3 weeks if you can be bothered and what l would do is put a huge cover over the couch which may be ruined anyway so why don't you count you losses and replace the couch when you leave instead of putting the cat through this trauma if you can find a vet that will do it.if this is a strictly indoor cat then ban it from the couch area during the day when at work and stop him the minute he starts.If an outside cat he will have no defense at all against other cats,dogs or anything else so you will result in a dead cat.Work out the cost factor,the health and well being of your cat and make a decision.Normally a cat likes to scratch on the back of the couch not the front so buy something that covers both front and back to prevent this from happening.l know how you feel l own my house and it is 2 storey one and although they have several scratching posts l have one that loves to claw on the stairs which are carpeted so will have to put new  carpet there but l cannot and would not de-claw despite my siamese are house cats|`|XEbe4Votaa	Yes, a vet will do it.<br>  However, I would absolutely pay the extra to get the laser surgery if you really think you must do it.<br>  <br>  <br>  You say you've tried scratching posts, but you don't really say much about that.  I have to wonder how well you're really making use of them.<br>  <br>  Example:  My cats decided they like to scratch on the corner of my bed.  So, I bought something like this: <a href="http://www.catsplay.com/ppets_post.php3" rel="nofollow">http://www.catsplay.com/ppets_post.php3</a>    and put it right at the corner of my bed in front of where they scratch.  Now, they don't bother with the bed at all, the post is better for sinking claws into anyway.  <br>  <br>  You cannot just buy a single post and stick it somewhere out of the way and expect the cat to scratch on it - that's just not how cats work.<br>  <br>  I have one declawed cat - I completely regret having done it.  (I worked at a vet and it was so common I didn't even think about it at the time)  I highly suggest you really exhaust all other options before you have it done.|`|1hciyvKdaa	If the couch is ruined already, save the money and buy them a new couch when you move. You already have a deposit, any surgery is extremely expensive, and so cruel to the cat. I lost my very first, paid by me to a store, not used couch to my cats, I know your frustration. My replacement couch, cat had no interest in. If you had gotten couch covers, It may of helped, probably too late now though eh?|`|gU34xa9vaa	Declawing a cat of any age, from a tiny kitten, to a cat of your cat's age or older, is very cruel and wrong. The operation is banned in 25 countries so far, as it's classed as animal abuse.It's the most painful thing you can ever do to a cat and most cats have terrible consequences,they turn to biting because they feel defenceless without their toes and claws,they have litter tray problems because their stumps hurt too much to use litter,so they turn to soiling on the carpets and soft furnishings.Some cats don't even survive the operation, some bleed to death, all are shocked and confused and never the same again.No reputable vet will declaw a cat now, the ones who do, do it for the money.Please don't trust your cat to a person like that ! Yes lasering is less bloody and the wounds heal quicker, but it's still as painful and traumatic to the cat and still has the same outcome,the cats toe ends are gone for good and  you can't put them back when you regret it.  Someone else mentioned another op where the tendons are cut, that is a BAD idea too, the claws then have to be trimmed regularly as the cat has no control over them, you are no better off and the cat has suffered  a useless procedure.You say yourself you know it's painful, yes it is, it's excruciating for the cat. <br>  Have you tried more scratching posts around the house ? Clipping your cat's claws regularly ? Try again , please don't let another cat suffer as many are already, from the dreadful outcome of declawing.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	I doubt you've exhausted all of your options and alternatives. There's more than just scratching posts and Soft Paws. If all else failed, I'd far sooner rehome a cat I loved than put it through this barbaric procedure.<br>  <br>  Do you realize what goes into declawing? It's not a simple removal of the claws but a full blown amputation of healthy toes. Declawing a cat means removing the entire first joint/bone of each toe. It'd be like cutting our fingers off at the first knuckle. Declawing causes extreme pain to the cat and often problems down the line (litter box issues from associating the litter box with pain after surgery, personality changes/biting/and skittishness from having their first line of defense removed, arthritis from having to learn a new way of carrying their weight etc.). I hear people say all the time "better declawed than in a shelter", but in actuality many declawed cats end up in shelters anyway because of the behavioral problems many experience after being declawed.<br>  <br>  Did you know it's illegal and considered inhumane mutilation in most countries outside the U.S.? I've personally observed a declaw surgery at a vet and it's not a pretty sight to watch a vet take guillotine nail clippers and lop off parts of toes... very barbaric looking (laser removal has less healing time and pain, but really isn't that much better in the long run). Please don't put your furniture over your cat's well being, it's just selfish. Declawing has no benefits to the cat, only the owner. There are numerous alternatives including scratching posts and surfaces, sticky tape, deterrent sprays, Soft Paws nail caps, and nail trimming.

I am against getting cats declawed... =(<br>  <br>  I didn't know declawing a cat was so bad until I went to go adopt one.

Please don't get your cat declawed!|`|0mb78CiWaa	De-clawing a cat is very mean. Try the pet tape, most pet stores sell it. It is a very tough tape you put on your furniture.|`|G032Flc3aa	Of course you have a choice, and given the fact that you've already said you know it's painful and had previously said you never would I can't think why you're even considering this cruel mutilation of a three years old cat! You obviously know how horrific it is if you've already said you never would so why go back on that and betray your cat for the sake of a couch that sounds as though it's already doomed anyway? Far better to save the fortune it would cost you if you find a butcher willing to deprive her of her toes and buy a replacement couch if you move out of your present home.<br>  Soft paws are not meant to stay on permanently, they do come off and you have to keep replacing them, cat scratching posts placed around the house would surely help, tall, heavy ones that don't fall over when she scratches up them would be ideal, and rub catnip into them to attract her to them and praise her lavishly when she uses them. Try using a large throw over your couch or other furniture.  Clip the sharp points off her claws if you have to but please, please don't convince yourself that you have no choice but to declaw.<br>  <br>  In most civilized countries declawing is illegal because it is considered as animal abuse, it is not an option so people have to use their heads and think of humane solutions to clawing problems, or if not prepared to do that then they don't have a cat in the first place.  That's the trouble it's all too easy to pick the phone up and make an appointment to have a cats toes removed and as long as there is a demand then certain vets are always going to be only too willing to take large amounts of money off people too lazy or too uneducated to solve their problems humanely.|`|IuYekkPVaa	Declawing is illegal where I live, so I'm not in favour of it being done to any cats, regardless of age.  You admit yourself that it's a painful procedure, so I'd urge you to try humane alternatives to prevent her from scratching.  I also live in rented, furnished accomodation and haven't had any problems with either of my two cats scratching the leather sofas or other furniture, because they have their own scratch items.<br>  <br>  Cats have got scent glands on their paws, so when they scratch somewhere it leaves a smell that they need to top up when it begins to fade.  This is why she continues to scratch your couch, and why scratch posts work once they become impregnated with the cat's claw scent.<br>  <br>  You need to temporarily conceal her claw scent by covering the area of the couch that she scratches with a throw or a sheet of thick plastic.  Another alternative is to disguise her claw scent by spraying the couch with something citrus scented.  Feliway also helps prevent unwanted scratching because it mimics the scent found in their facial glands and cats don't generally scratch areas that they rub their faces against.  (For this method to work, you need to spray Feliway once a day for 21 days on the affected area.)  <br>  <br>  Cats have individual preferences for the textures they enjoy scratching. Not all of them enjoy using a scratch post because the sisal is wound horizontally around the post and most cats prefer something with a vertical thread. Have you tried offering her a few alternatives; corrugated cardboard, wooden log, heavy duty door mat etc., to see what she likes using? Have you tried rubbing the post with catnip or spraying it with honeysuckle? Cats are attracted to these scents and can be used to entice them to scratch there. Another trick is to trail toys or pieces of string over the post so that they have to grab for it with their claws. Once they've done that a few times, they usually get the idea it feels good to scratch there. Because part of the desire to scratch is to mark territory, both visually and with scent, be sure to place her scratch item next to the sofa, as it may be the location that is part of the attraction for her to scratch there. Reward her using it with lots of praise and food treats as encouragement.<br>  <br>  These links have lots of helpful advice on teaching cats to use a scratch post, trimming their claws and ways that you can protect furniture, wallpaper etc.,<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20problems/cats/scratching.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.celiahaddon.co.uk/pet%20probl...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/</a>|`|R2aTEi9Kaa	Any vet that would agree to do it is a vet I would NOT trust under any cirmumstances, No cat should EVER be declawed, but a cat as old as yours will have severe side effects both mentally and physically and it was take him twice to three times as long to heal because of his age.. Read this and you'll understand why.<br>  <br>  Declawing isn't declawing it all, its De-toeing, the vet performs 10 radical AMPUTATIONS of the cats toes down to the first knuckle. The vet also severs four major tendons which permanently prevent the cat from stretching whats left of its mutilated toes. The vet also severs and cauterizes major arteries and blood vessels. A cats claws grow directly out of BONE, the only way to remove the nail bed is to remove the bone that makes up the entire first knuckle of the cats toes.<br>  <br>  The surgery is excruciating for the cat and anyone who says different (in this post or other posts or even on different forums or in person) does not know anything about the nature of a cat. To a cat Pain is a sigh of weakness, in the wild weak animals are picked off and eaten so as such cats are ABSOLUTE MASTERS at hiding their pain, because they DO NOT under any circumstance want to appear week. ALL cats suffer tremendously after this surgery, most wake up and are in so much agony that they scream and fly all over their kennels bashing their heads against the walls trying to make the pain go away.<br>  <br>  Cats WALK on their TOES, this surgery removes those toes and then the cat is forced to immediately walk on his or her mutilated and sore feet. Imagine having half of your foot cut off and then being forced to walk on whats left of them...because of the anatomy of a cats foot and claws it is EXACTLY the same. (It is also comparable to cutting off human fingers at the first knuckle, not the knuckle directly under your finger nail but the knuckle below that).<br>  <br>  MANY cats stop using the litterbox after being declawed because they associate it with pain as they have to dig to use it and digging with mutilated feet is agony directly after surgery and the cat maintains that association for the rest of his or her life.. Instead they resort to using the furniture and carpets as their litterbox. MANY cats also resort to biting as a defense mechanism as their main defense is gone. (If the cat is already aggressive, he will continue to attack her but will instead bite her HARD as he has no other means of defense)<br>  <br>  MANY cats stop trusting humans after this procedure and become emotionally scared, bitter, angry and anti social and remain that way for the duration of their life. (this makes them MORE aggressive and as I said before he will simple bite rather then scratch)<br>  <br>  Can you deal with a neurotic fear biting cat who is using your entire house as his personal litterbox???<br>  <br>  Also the cat will be unable to properly defend itself if it gets outside as the front claws are a cats primary mode of defense and a declawed cat will not stand a chance against a clawed cat, dog, coyote etc...<br>  <br>  The next thing you needs to understand is that cats are physically UNABLE to stretch the muscles in their front quarters, sides, back, and front legs because they do so by digging in their claws and pulling back against them, without their claws this is physically impossible to do. De clawed cats are therefor prone to muscle stiffness, spasms, and arthritis. (NOTE: this conditions are degenerative and can take many years to fully manifest).<br>  <br>  Not to mention that because cats walk on their toes, the removal of those toes permanently alters the way the cat walks which alters the cats gait (position of his or her spine, neck and legs) which usually leads to back and hip pain. ( that again the cat will hide until its unbearable).<br>  <br>  Another side effect of this surgery is painful regrowth of the claw inside the pad. Occasionally if the surgery is not properly performed the claw begins to regrow inside the pad on the cats foot, as I stated earlier cats HIDE their pain so you will not know about this regrowth until the cat is in absolute agony and cannot take the pain anymore.<br>  <br>  This surgery is a barbaric mutilation that many vets perform and even condone for the simple fact that they make alot of money doing it. The typical cost for a front declaw in Canada and the US is $300 so you can imagine the profit for the vet.<br>  <br>  You may also have heard that laser declawing is less painful and involves a quicker recovery, this is TOTAL BS. In order for the laser to be effective is has to burn through bone, burns through the bone are FOURTH degree burns. Laser declawing is actually MORE painful but the laser machine costs a single veterinarian upwards of $30,000 so they advocate the procedure to make their money back (yes the recovery is slightly shorter because the wounds are instantly cauterized but it is still absolute agony for the cat).<br>  <br>  The The last thing I want to explain is why cats actually scratch, so that you understand the mechanics.<br>  1) They scratch to shed the outer most layer of the nail, a cats nail is like an onion and if they don't shed the dead outer sheath their claws will get sore and infected. (when a cat scratches a scratching post it DOES NOT dull the nail, it sharpens it, however, it is necessary to provide an adequate scratching surface for the cat)<br>  2) There are scent glands on the pads of a cats foot so whenever they scratch something they are marking it with their scent.<br>  3) As I already stated before they NEED their claws to stretch their muscles.<br>  4) Kittens DO NOT have proper control over the retraction of their claws, it takes a little over a year for them to learn this control. So they generally scratch everything because their claws are always out. As he ages and matures he WILL learn how to retract them and keep them retracted. (often what some people perceive as aggression is simple an over zealous and very playful kitten who will calm down once he reaches adult hood). (my male cat was much like your sisters cat, now as an adult he always keeps them retracted and never scratches me)<br>  <br>  The best thing to do (what you HAVE to do) is clip the cats nails every two weeks with a good quality pair of nail clippers to remove the sharp tip. Also make sure to provide scratch posts large enough for the cat to climb on and sleep on (at least four feet or higher) and spray it with a catnip spray to attract the cat. Use double sided tape,tinfoil and a spray bottle to deter the cat from the furniture.<br>  <br>  Declawing is illegal in 23 countries for being cruelty to animals. It is a cruel, needless, barbaric mutilation of an innocent animal who cannot speak for itself.<br>  <br>  Please don't do this, anyone who is informed of the risks and side effects and still has the surgery done is no animal lover and should never be allowed to own anther cat.<br>  <br>  Blessings to your kitten|`|ZSyzb3Zyaa	please do NOT declaw your cat, whether it's indoor or outdoor. it is like getting your fingers cut off. it is a very long and painful recovery and it will do lots of damage to your cat. there is a very big possibility that it will get infected and besides that, most vets will not do that operation because it is cruelty. you will have a very difficult time finding a vet who cares at all about animals that will do that. imagine yourself being defingered by your owner? you would probably be afraid of them after that. try squirting your cat with water whenever you see it scratching or make a loud noise. say in a stern voice NO! and it will probably get scared and stop doing that. it will make your cat no more scared of you. you could just put your cat in a room without furniture while you are gone with food and water. let it up when you are around so you can monitor its behaviour. that is what i do with my cat.|`|wx1WVpP5aa	Yes it's painful and horrible and cruel<br>  <br>  <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a><br>  <br>  Some vets will still do it but they are the money grabbing ones and I wouldn't trust therm near any of my cats for sure.

They basically take out the cats knuckle along with the nail... there is a new procedure out there that is done with a laser and it cuts the tendon inside the foot it's not painful for the animal like regular declawing it just stops them from being able to retract their claws so she wouldn't be able to scratch. Check at the petstore they may have some deterant spray that you could put on the sofa to keep your kitty away. The problem is that when they scratch they scent the item and it is drawing her back.|`|huEWXxmLaa	You might find a vet to do it, it will cost a lot of money, because the ones who do it are out to make money, thats all, they don't care that your cat will be crippled for life.<br>  Look at this:<br>  <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/..." rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a><br>  Imagine your poor cat like that.<br>  and read up on here too about declawing :<br>  <a href="http://www.goodcatswearblack.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.goodcatswearblack.com/</a><br>  I've done a lot of research lately and heard such awful true stories that I can't think how anyone can even consider doing such a cruel thing to their cat.|`|bFtUnaeHaa	no no no no no. Do NOT declaw your cat. Not only does that cause them all kinds of health problems later in life, but it also completely screws them up psychologically.

It is like removing half of your finger. You can buy nail clippers at you vet or Petland and you can clip her own nails. But whatever you do... Don't declaw... please!|`|Rw7gi86Naa	If you’re thinking about having your cat declawed, there are many things you should know before you make your decision.  The surgery is basically an American trend, and is considered inhumane and is illegal in many countries, (England, Scotland, Wales, Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands, Northern Ireland, Ireland, Denmark, Finland, Slovenia, Portugal, Belgium, Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, Yugoslavia and Japan).  If that doesn’t impact your opinion about declawing, maybe this website will help you decide: <a href="http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/declawpics/" rel="nofollow">http://community-2.webtv.net/stopdeclaw/...</a> <br>  <br>  I believe that people who have their cats declawed are uneducated.  It is not very difficult to train your cat to use a scratching post.  The surgery is not simply a trimming of the claws, it’s an amputation of the distal phalanx, including bones, ligaments, and tendons! To remove the claw, the bone, nerve, joint capsule, collateral ligaments, and the extensor and flexor tendons must all be amputated.  If you were to make a comparison, it would be like having the last joint of each of our fingers chopped off.  So of course it is a painful surgery, with a painful recovery.  There are often many complications in the healing process, including infection often from litter box use, resulting in a life-long aversion to the litter box.  Other declawed cats that can no longer mark with their claws, will mark with urine instead, resulting in inappropriate elimination problems.  <br>  <br>  Many cats who have been declawed are traumatized and become withdrawn, nervous, fearful and/or aggressive.  Cats who went through the painful surgery are more prone to resort to biting when they feel threatened.  Since cats have emotional feelings, (just like we do) they can resent you if you decided to get them declawed.  All of these things can cause depression and ultimately lead to an overweight cat.<br>  <br>  If a cat who has been declawed accidentally escapes, he/she would be in great danger.  A cat needs it's claws to defend itself, as well as to escape by climbing.  The constant state of stress, caused by a feeling of defenselessness may make some declawed cats more prone to disease.  Also they cannot stretch their back and shoulder muscles like they do naturally when they dig their claws into a scratching post.  <br>  <br>  One popular alternative is Soft Paws.  They are lightweight vinyl nail caps that you glue on the cat's front claws.  They're great for households with small children and are extremely useful for people who are away from home all day and can't exercise the watchfulness necessary to train a cat to use a scratching post.  Soft Paws are easy to apply and last about four to six weeks.  They come in clear or colors--which are really fun.<br>  <br>  Most common types of damage are scratched furniture, ripped carpets and shredded wallpaper.  You want to eliminate the problem before it occurs.  Buy or build a stable, tall scratching-post, right from the start.  Here are some tips to do it right: If your cat is scratching your furniture or rugs, here is some advice on training them to use a scratching post:<br>  - The post should be at least two feet high, covered with sisal-rope, (mine like the carpeted ones)<br>  - Get more than one, especially when you have a multi-cat household <br>  - Place the post close to the furniture or other areas which are most at risk <br>  - Introduce a new scratching-post with some catnip sprinkled on its surface.  Cats love that and it’s more attractive to them <br>  - If your cat starts scratching the "wrong" object, say "NO" and gently carry your cat to the desired post.  Demonstrate how to use it by scratching the post with your own nails.  If the cat doesn‘t catch on after trying this repeatedly for a few days, gently pick up his paws rub them along the post.<br>  - Never force your cat.  When it starts scratching the post by itself, make sure you use verbal praise with a rewarding treat and plenty of affection.  The cat needs to know that using the scratching post results in positive things such as affection, playing and treats.<br>  - When you have a kitten, start early with the "pawing at post" technique <br>  - Invest in what’s called a “cat tree” which acts also as a leisure area for your cat.  Different textures and heights make it more interesting, you perhaps want to build it yourself <br>  - Try some repellent like pepper-dust or some commercial products on your furniture to keep your cat off these areas<br>  - Be persistent and don't give up too soon<br>  <br>  Use cat claw trimmers and only take off a tiny bit at the end of the nail. Some people say to do it every other week. I think it‘s safer to cut off less than you are told, and to do it more often, (like once a week). Never use trimmers that are made for humans or dogs, because you are more likely to hurt her that way. You can ask your vet or groomer to show you the proper way to do it. Here's a website that shows you how:  <br>  <a href="http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/article.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.catscratching.com/htmls/artic...</a>|`|c4dny3nfaa	Man, you might find a vet to declaw a 3 year old cat, but if you do, you'll regret it, as the only ones to do it now are butchers who shouldn't be let anywhere near a cat.You do have a choice you know and I think because you asked on here you wanted people to convince you that you are right to say it's painful and you never would do it.<br>  I don't know how much it will run, but it will be a lot as its blood money, your cat's blood at that !!

Like refusing to use the litter pan and peeing on rugs, etc.<br>  <br>  Try covering the furniture with sticky tape.  And learn to trim the nails.

You have about a 90% chance of your cat ending up with either severe biting problems, litter box issues and SEVERE arthritis or depression.<br>  <br>  The soft paws are supposed to come off, your cats nails grow and they will eventually come off. If you have been putting them on yourself then that's probably why they aren't lasting. Go to a groomer to have them put on and they should last between 6-8 weeks. You could also just clip your cats nails every two weeks.<br>  <br>  It would probably be cheaper for you to just go out and buy some cheap furniture so you don't have to rent it and worry about it being destroyed.<br>  <br>  You could also try putting some contact paper folded over onto the edges of the couch, this will deter her from scratching them because her nails will stick to them.<br>  <br>  Declawing is never an option, it is illegal in so many countries for a reason. If NOTHING works then honestly I think your cat would be better off being rehomed, a kitten might be able to sometimes recover from an amputation alright, but a three year old cat absolutely will not. Vets are in it for the money, so I'm sure you could find a vet who would do it, but I don't think you should.
112862c956520418ed6b12a9b3493af8aa	No, no soy indiferente al sufrimiento de los animales. Como ejemplo no es muy bueno el de las corridas de toros, ya que gracias a ellas el toro tiene una calidad de vida incomparable con la de cualquier otro animal criado por el hombre, viviendo en en grandes espacios abiertos y en semilibartad, además gracias a la existencia de las corridas se garantiza la supervivencia de la especie del toro de lidia, por lo que tienen más de conservacionistas y de ejemplo de buen trato hacia los animales que lo que una mirada parcial hacia los últimos quince minutos de vida del animal pudiera adivinar.<br>  Me da muchísima más lástima cualquier animal que pasa toda su vida enjaulado y hacinado sin ver la luz del sol, que un toro de lidia. Y me gustaría que el trato con esos animales se eqiparara en lo posible al trato que durante toda su vida recibe un toro de lidia. Pero desgraciadamente estos animales si que suelen ser indiferentes para la gente. Quizás porque no son tan famosos ni se ocupan de ellos los medios de comunicación aun siendo un número infinitamente más grande que el de los toros y teniendo una vida infinitamente más cruel.<br>  <br>  A nadie le importa la muerte de una gallina que no ha visto en su vida la luz del sol, pero muchos arriesgan su vida por salvar la de un toro. ?Amor a los animales?, no.

2WBtknEyaa	Well there is only two answers one he may be sick or two irresponsible breeding. Goldens have been targeted to breed because they are pretty and are all around Good dogs but if the breeder doesn't know what there doing then the dog wont either.|`|LPEO6AsCaa	You may be right in saying he was born this way.  Especially if he was poorly bred in the fist place.  Golden's should be bred for not just the look but for temperament too.  If you got your golden from a byb or a pet store then that's your answer.  A well bred Golden displays all the right chartists of the Golden breed. <br>  A reputable breeder will breed for Temperment and looks and do temperment testing on all the pups to ensure each pup goes to the right owners.<br>  What your describing leads me to think your Golden had none of these things in the first place.<br>  You'll need training to correct this and get it under control now before it gets out of hand.<br>  NO Goldens should be a worry to its owner.<br>  NOTE:  At 7 years old they should have a thyroid test to make sure its ok.  Have your vet do this soon to see if his levels are off.  I'm not saying this is his problem but you should have it checked anyway.|`|20b2cb79cc0312b06b88a0ce2024af91aa	He isn't pure "bread" . He might be pure "bred". <br>  <br>  Goldens are notorious for having hypothyroid problems which can cause increased aggression or behavioral changes.<br>  <br>  You don't mention if he has always been this way, or if it just started, or even how old he is. All of those things can be important. <br>  <br>  Is he neutered? Does he see all right. Vision can cause problems like this. Have you had him checked out by a vet?|`|FhdyUQwGaa	actually golden retrievers are the dogs that bite more often than any other breed. You wouldn't think so, and personally i think it's because people tend to do stupid things to them because they think they'd never bite...but whatever.<br>  <br>  yes, you can fix it. But to fix it well you need a good trainer to show you exactly how to handle your dog. Your dog has an alpha personality, and he needs to be handled correctly. The alpha personality isn't real common in goldens, so don't feel like you messed up...just relax and get the right kind of help!|`|QP3bQxC9aa	this is your problem. listen i adopted my rott at 5 months and he had this problem, but i fixed it in a matter of days because i have had dominant breeds such as rotts and akitas and neighbors sheperds.

What i did is a day when there is no school, you play tug of war with him...make sure you win and never ever give up because if you lose he will think he has say over you...do this the whole day and if he growls yell at him, grow some balls and look him in the eye and grab the extra skin on his neck, if he bites you yell lowder and push him...i guarentee he will never do this again. hope this helps.|`|TSjjbK28aa	this just helps to prove the fact that breed is irrelevant. you need to contract a vet and trainer and/or dog behaviorist. this is very serious aggression and will lead to a bite.|`|77d61ef19b7fca48b88a81bf948785d2aa	let me tell you maybe its a lack of manners you have to take time with them and try to co operate with them look at their point of view try spending more time with it teaching manners and different tricks taking care of a dog is like taking care of a baby you have to take time with them, teach them ,care for them make up mind that its gonna take responsibility and love to make them understand. hope it helped
mFf8CqAraa	I don't see why not. The only deterrents you should keep in mind is any areas with breakable items or things that can harm them since cats get frisky and playful at certain times of the day or night.<br>  <br>  Personally, I keep the bathroom door closed when not in use because they have a tendency to knock down shampoo bottles on the shower ledge (which scares the crap out of me in the middle of the night).<br>  <br>  I also have my fishing gear in the closet and keep them out of the room because they find a way to open closet doors and I don't want them to get hurt on the fishing lures (which are in a closed box but I take no chances). <br>  <br>  Other than that my cats rule supreme in the house and I have a hard time trying to convince them that I am the master of the house.|`|AA12327015	If they're un-neutered males they may spray which can start to smell the houseup. You can't always find it on the wall or whatever after they do it. But if they're neutered then yes as long as they have access to their litter box.|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Why not? -What have you got to hide??  :)|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	It depends. There are too many different conditions to say whether they're allowed in all rooms or not. For instance, I would let my cat in a nursery if I had a child. It would be cruel to the cat to keep them locked in one room though. They need to run around and play.<br>  <br>  However, my cat has the run of the house now because it's just me. She's not allowed in my garage/laundry room (which is attached to the garage) but that's only because I tend to shut the door and she'll get locked in there for hours. She's allowed in the bedrooms as well but knows that she's not allowed on the beds.|`|0k2y3bNgaa	Yes, if it's potty trained and won't chew or scratch stuff up. I would buy it a scratching post because my kitty tends to scratch on my chair. <br>  <br>  But otherwise, yes! They deserve a full house :]|`|AKfZDADmaa	Of course they should they should now the whole house|`|gnIEDg6maa	I guess so.  I hate to see them on a kitchen table or on the counter. My cat did as it pleased. Of course, my drapes were shreds, my antique wicker baby buggy was all roughed up, the xmas bulbs at the bottom of the tree were broken, she used the bathroom in the bath tub, she liked to bat things off of the shelves, things like that.  She was worth it|`|0pFMFkXDaa	Yes, cats shouldn't be let outside because of all the dangers, so you need to give him/her the freedom, just watch your cat for the first couple of days, you may hvae to block off 1 certain room if there is a plant he likes to chew on or something|`|inST4SlAaa	yes they should.  if they do not they will find a way to make it happen!!  of course keep chemicols and other poison put away.  <br>  <br>  also, i have a friend who had a bunny and she would let him out when she exercised on one of those step master machines and she had the music on and the bunny went underneath the peddle and was killed. she felt so bad!!|`|0mb78CiWaa	Of course! If it is a indoor it is bad enough they can't go outside. It is worse if a cat has a boundary in the house too.|`|dYohQxTCaa	i think so, my cats do and they love it.  I always keep an eye on my cats the first few days to make sure they don't tear up.|`|T6SPad3Haa	Mine always have!<br>  <br>  If your cat doesn't go outside its important they have as much room as possible to run and play.|`|Rw7gi86Naa	Well you mention any problems or give a reason why you shouldn't, so yes.|`|yLiOgVEYaa	i would say yes. but it really depends on the house and if there are other pets or children. my cats rule my house :)|`|rpWO5vL4aa	Without additional details we don't have much to base our answer on. But yes, in general almost any cat can and should have free run! In a way it's bad enough that we keep cats indoors and deprive them of exploring and such, so there's no reason to limit them inside as well, unless there's something we don't know about like urinating outside the litter box. Anyway, hope that helps!|`|q2gcd1p5aa	My cat has free run of our house. If I don't want her in a certain room, I just close the door. I don't see why any cat shouldn't be allowed to roam the house. If they're litter trained you shouldn't have any problems. But if you keep a cat from a certain part of the house, that's just going to make them more curious and more inclined to do what it takes to get to where they're not supposed to be.|`|aN4SUKkRaa	Depends. But if you want to have cat fur all over your clothes in the closet, the cat getting in your way when you're cooking. a screeching banshee that's just had its tail trodden upon, yes!<br>  <br>  And what happens if you buy some good furniture and you've allowed the cat to claw the old furniture? The cat won't give a rats about whether it's a $5000 sofa, it will just think you've replaced its scratching post!<br>  <br>  BTW: my cat DOES have the run of the place!! I think I'm just there to operate the can opener!!|`|0RBiVF20aa	YES! Unless they are urinating on things inappropriately. But that is a whole other issue. I've found it's good for their mental health to shut them in the bedroom with you when you go to bed though. They seem to like it and consider it a bonding experience.|`|3RfHq80Naa	Your cat has free run of what you tell it.<br>  It's a cat.<br>  Plus, they can make all sorts of trouble, like coughing up hairballs in shoes and waking you up.  If you want to keep her out of a room, that's fine.|`|ZQJfkGwJaa	Way too many "ifs", but if the cat is spayed and/or neutered, it uses its litter box, and has no other "undesirable habits, then yes, it can have free run of the house.|`|Bqpk2yZGaa	yea if its potty/ litter trained it should be able to go through out a whole house!  :)

hC4Z8HIbaa	Yes, a hairless rat's skin can get a little dried out. To moisturize his skin, rub some olive oil on him. It is safe and edible, so you don't have to worry about it being dangerous. You can either rub it on and leave it sit, then wash it off, or just leave it on and let him clean himself or let the other rats clean him. That way, it's fun for everyone and lets your rats bond.<br>  <br>  To comment on the post below mine: The olive oil will work. I don't know how, but it does. I know lots of people who use this method to keep the skin of their hairless rats soft and moist. I think it's also supposed to work to remove the buck grease from male fur, but I'm not 100% on that.<br>  <br>  If you want to research hairless rats more, you can check out the forum below. There are several people there that own hairless rats, and you can get an idea of how to care for them, since hairless care is slightly different than a furred rat. Not too much a difference, just paying more attention to certain details.|`|tTP8KA2Oaa	CongRATS (lolz) on getting your hairless rat. I personally dont have a hairless rat, but i think i might be able to help. From what I know, dandriff is caused by normally just dry flakey skin. So as the first person said, it needs somesort of moisturizer. I dk if olive oil will work, but as i said, i dont have a hairless rat. But if i were you I'd go to the pet store and ask someone who works there, what they recommend.<br>  --Hope i helpd!! <br>  ---------KLiO:)|`|PsFYZL2waa	I own a hairless rat of my own, her name is Gremlin. <br>  <a href="http://x90.xanga.com/b178506210518230243180/b181432980.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://x90.xanga.com/b178506210518230243...</a><br>  <br>  And as the person above me suggested, olive oil works wonders on their dry skin.

6fb550117e5669e2b43ded94a7c57a37aa	Claro que puedes, de todas maneras preguntale al veterinario y saldrás de tus dudas.

LwEwd7lcaa	I have had three puppies, and what has worked best for me is to whine like a puppy when the puppy tries to playbite.  That is something they can relate to and understand.  Right after the whine I offer the puppy a bone or a toy and praise him if he stopped as soon as i whined.  I would not use this method for a grown dog.  But with puppies its different.|`|GSf09ALBaa	This is very normal puppy behavior and is often brought up on this site. What people do not understand is this is the way they play with other dogs and their litter mates.  At the age of 10 weeks he is playing and does not realize his teething on your appendages is not acceptable.  Of course you realize he is teething and needs access to good chew bones and toys.  When he is playing with you are you using a toy?  If you are using your hands to rough with him, then you are getting what is expected.  Play with him with his toys.  If he does happen to nip you, give a NO and stop the play.  A snap of the fingers gets their attention.  But do not expect this to go away for awhile.  You are going to have to deal with this.  You have a puppy.|`|15Zr5voMaa	Well my puppy does the same thing. When she bites when <br>  You walk away from her she bites you cause she does not <br>  Want you to go away from you. So when she is biting to much<br>  You hold her down on her back holding her throat not<br>  Choaking her but holding her throat losely. When she stops fighting<br>  You and biting you then let her up. Hope it works!|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Often dogs do what is called 'mouthing and it means chewing on your fingers especially when they are teething.At 10 weeks this pup has its milk teeth only and has developedd a habit you have to break NOW.<br>  Firmly say NO,Bad Dog!Walk away and do not playignoree the puppy and he will get themessagee soon enough.Same as jumping on you or people this must be stopped at puppy stage as it will continue in adult life.Using a water pistol achieves nothing it is your voice and disapproval that is needed to stop this nipping which is no uncommon in pups|`|NZ68zuq3aa	First off try and divert his attention with some great chewing toys like nylabones and such. He's just entered his teething phase and it's gonna be a while until he's out of it. If he continues biting rub some bitter apple spray on your hands and arms he will hate the taste and most likely will stop biting you right away. My puppy did the same thing for a while and it was driving me crazy, i thought it would never go away. The spray worked well but it's hard to keep reapplying it and you need to wash your hands before you eat anything.|`|WOxxbQFsaa	gosh i have the same problem with my 11 week old beagle puppy and ill tell u one thing,Never ever hurt him or slap him in the face (it will make him hand shy )what i do is i have a toy of his with me and when he bites me i say no very loud and strict and then i give him his toy and it seems to work!<br>  hope that helps!u just gotta be insistant...|`|XCn2dK1laa	say no loudly and I used to use a flipflop to bop my old dog on the nose so that i would just have to say Shoe and she'd go running<br>  harsh,maybe<br>  effective,yes|`|T6SPad3Haa	smacking is NEVER an option for teaching a dog not to bite. They will either start to fear you or think that smacking is a form of playing back.<br>  <br>  There is no quick option for training dogs. I have a GSD mix that was very bitey when I got her. shes a little older than yours right now and never bites anymore thanks to our training.<br>  <br>  When she puts her jaws on you and exerts pressure that becomes painful say "ow!" or make a yelp anything that will startle (but not scare don't be too loud). Immediately get up and turn away, stop paying it attention until the puppy is calm again.<br>  If he bites again and gets riled up replace your hands with a toy and play via the toy.<br>  If he gets too crazy you have to put he away/restrain her untill he is calm.<br>  <br>  Most dogs grow out of it.

5598bd1170afaaf3f964f480815cc0a6aa	There are more than 20 disorders that  can lead to increased drinking and urinating. It can be frustrating to sort through them all but the only thing that you can do is to start eliminating the disorders until you find the one that is causing the problem. <br>  The list of disorders that cause increased drinking <br>  include: <br>  <br>  1) kidney failure  (chronic, acute, infectious (leptospirosis, esp.)) <br>  2) hyperadrenocorticism (Cushing's disease) <br>  3) diabetes mellitus <br>  4) liver failure <br>  5) hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's disease) <br>  6) pyometra (uterine infection, applies to females only, obviously) <br>  7) intestinal obstruction  (occurs after toxins begin to be absorbed <br>  from the damaged intestine) <br>  8) pyelonephritis (infection of the kidney) <br>  9) hypercalcemia (most commonly from cancer) <br>  10) diabetes insipidus  -- can be central (brain related) or <br>  nephrogenic (kidney related) <br>  11) behavioral or psychogenic water drinking <br>  12) acromegaly <br>  13) polycythemia <br>  14) hypokalemia <br>  15) renal glycosuria (Fanconi's syndrome) <br>  16) partial obstruction of the urinary tract <br>  17) neurologic damage leading to urine retention or difficulty voiding <br>  18) medications (diuretics, corticosteroids) <br>  19) pheochromocytoma (a form of cancer) <br>  20) pericardial effusion <br>  21) hypothyroidism (dogs) or hyperthyroidism (cats) --  not too common <br>  with these <br>  22) paraneoplastic syndromes (usually this is hypercalcemia but <br>  sometimes other substances linked to tumors cause increased drinking) <br>  <br>  Most of the time a number of these conditions can be eliminated based on the physical examination and initial blood chemistry panel, urinalysis and complete blood cell count.|`|5acd43a24cf0572d8f3033184de498cfaa	Excessive drinking and urinating are the main symptoms of diabetes in people and in dogs. If you know anyone that has a blood sugar testing devise you can check it easily at home. The best way to get a small sample of blood is to snip the end of one of the toe nails with dog nail clippers just in the quick. This should give you a couple of drops of blood which will be more than enough for a reading. If the reading is over about 100 there is a good chance that the dog is diabetic. The sample should be taken prior to the dog eating. Now keep in mind that if you do this, it is only a peek into whether the dog is diabetic for sure or not. The vet will do a much more in depth test that last several hours and this test will let you know for sure whether it is diabetes or not. IF the dog is diabetic, these are some things you will be facing for the rest of the animal's life. Daily insulin injections, special food, regular vet visits, round the clock supervision etc etc. It is enough to make someone really think hard about whether or not they want to take on all of this for such a young dog! Good luck and I hope it is not anything serious.|`|AA12335756	My mom has a pom that is diabetic and get insulin injections twice a day. He does not have to be on "special" food and have 24 hour care and supervision... That's just silly. Also having a pet that is diabetic is not as expensive as one might thing. Find out what is wrong first from your vet and take it from there. The other person that posted about returning the dog to the breeder was right... they will only put it down. There is no resale value in an animal that has health issues. I also agree with the point of rescue a shelter dog...|`|M3jRtq2Aaa	It is symptoms of DM, but it probably isn't the disease.  Puppies do this alot.  It fills their tummys just like mummy's milk, so they hog it in. I would assume she is fine.|`|Tpi7kJGFaa	It could very well be diabetes. But not always the case. There are certain small breeds that are prone to getting it. We just put our mini schnauzer down who had it. He was showing the same symptoms your dog is. with the exessive drinking and urination. It is not that hard to take care of them we did it for 3 yrs. He will have to be on a special diet and more than likely insulin. You dont have to watch him 24/7 but just keep an eye on if there is any change that is out of the ordinary for your dog. Just make sure you keep regular appointments with the vet to keep it monitored and he will live a long life.|`|Z64FKAk7aa	Could be a bladder infection but could well be diabetes.  Highly bred pups come with all sorts of complications unless you go to a REALLY reputable breeder.  You have to do lots of research before settling on one breeder.  Trust me, I know.  She may have anxiety issues, but you don't mention that so my bet is the diabetes.  I do hope not.  Good luck.  I know once you have adopted it's impossible to return them on an emotional level but you sound like you have HAD it!|`|udIIbcEJaa	Could be a kidney problem, maybe just an infection.  You are doing the right thing by seeing your vet, make sure you get a written statement with a contact number so the breeder can talk to the vet should you decide to thake the dog back.

If you take the pet back to the breeder, they will just put her down.  Let's hope that it is something as simple as a UTI for her sake.  Poor baby.  Next time, adopt a shelter pet and don't buy from a breeder or puppy mill.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	There's several things it could be from kidney disease to Cushing's syndrome, perhaps hypothyroidism.

GUEsVdaFaa	You should do one of the following options:<br>  <br>  1) take the cat to a place that offers pet boarding<br>  <br>  2) take the cat to stay with a friend or family member while you're away<br>   <br>  3) leave the cat at home unattended with plenty of food, water and clean litter *BUT ONLY* if you can have a friend or family member check on the cat DAILY<br>  <br>  4) leave the cat at home and ask a friend, family member, or pet sitter to stay with your kitty until you return<br>  <br>  <br>  Cats (and all pets for that matter) should NEVER be left alone for extended periods lasting more than 8 to 10 hours. If your cat gets into something like poison or gets stuck in something while you're away it will be dead by the time you return. It's very important to have someone who can check up on your pet every day while you're out. I had a friend who owned a cat, I won't mention her name, and she left her cat alone for three days. When she came back she discovered that the cat had caught and eaten a mouse that had just eaten rat poison. And since she didn't catch it the same day it happened her cat died. It was really very sad.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	You can put it in a cat hotel - they are usually about $15 a day. Sometimes vets will board animals for you. Or you can take it to stay with a family member or friend, or leave your keys with someone (a friend or neighbor you trust) and have them check on the cat every day and change its water and feed it.

Surely you'll tell them you'll be away for a period. If you get along well with them, they'll be keeping an eye on your place anyway so it's not a stretch to ask them to feed the cat etc. Cats don't have to be walked for exercise, it's not a big hassle like a dog. When you return, thank them by buying them something, booze, cigarettes, pot plant, whatever floats their boat. AND they'll be happy to do it again...<br>  <br>  If you don't have this luxury, check out Catteries in your area.

hC4Z8HIbaa	The cage is familiar, but I can't quite identify it to be able to tell you. Do you know the make or model? That way I can punch some numbers and be able to tell you. It's hard to tell from a picture without having dimensions. I'm thinking it might be, but I can't say for sure unless I know dimensions.<br>  <br>  Oh, and I'd not put her near the curtains. A bored rattie (which looks like your rat will become very bored without anything stimulating in the cage) will try very hard to get the curtains. If you don't keep the rat a decent distance from the curtains, they could be shredded by the morning. I was keeping my rat cage in my closet, and my rats chewed the bottom off one of my dresses. I definetly learned my lesson from that.|`|jKi4QgAoaa	BIG ENOUGH 4 HUNCHBACK FUKJAK|`|1s2LSgqPaa	I have a rat and it seems to have decent cage, it is big enough.|`|VintPLpMaa	Yes it is big enough. She is cute and so is the rabbit.|`|2W0Tp9Ocaa	Hmmmmmm. It is a nice, decent sized cage (especially as you have only 1 rat). Then again I may be wrong since I am not able to determine the exact measurements. Even so, for the time being I do not think you will need a bigger one (unless of course you do decide to get your rat a friend) then I would probably reconsider another, slightly larger cage depending on the measurements of the one you currently have. I am looking at a photo so it can be quite hard to determine these things (even with the pillow!).<br>  <br>  Your rat will get bigger and of course older and may not be able to walk up the ramps to reach its house and so that may mean reconsidering getting a wider cage instead of a tall, narrow one.<br>  <br>  I agree with Amaranth. If you do have wire flooring make sure you remove it as can cause many problems in a rat's foot!<br>  <br>  Below I have included a list of toys. <br>  <br>  Toys (general):<br>  <br>  - Hammocks - hammocks are great and one of the best toys a rat could have! They love to snuggle up in it and keep warm. (How to make a hammock, further on).<br>  <br>  - Toilet rolls<br>  <br>  - Paper bags: Rats love to shred and tear these apart. <br>  <br>  - Nest box - Tissue boxes are good for the rat to sleep in.

I am sure your rat will have a good home. :)|`|65e71fbb06f5d33192d9789c626a3e49aa	Sure, I've had two rats in a cage just like that.  I do suggest giving your ratty plenty of time outside of the cage in a safe place with you.  I would make that suggestion that no matter how big the cage is, though!  <br>  I must mention that I love the first pic with the very interested cat...!<br>  I recommend ferret toys or even bird toys (mouse/hamster stuff is too small for an adult rat).  My ratties loved ferret hammocks and parrot chew toys (the kind with the heavy rope and wood blocks to chew on).  Ferret tubes are fun for them to run through--they won't fit in the cage but they are great for playtime outside of the cage.  <br>  Introducing a new rat is kind of iffy.  Only do this if you are willing to run the risk of them not getting along, in which case you may end up needing yet another cage for the newbie.|`|PsFYZL2waa	For now, that cage is big enough, but rats shouldn't be kept alone. They are social creatures and as much as you'd like to think your company enough for her, she will need a rat companion.|`|M7KT6NSCaa	yes that looks big enough. if you get 2 rats it still should be big enough i think but more than that and maybe a new one shoul be gotten. glad you gave a rat a good home:) congrats.|`|zHrCviSsaa	yes. that is plenty big  enough. looks good. and a hidey house of some kind will b perfect for it. yay rats!!!! haha|`|ziPhihHNaa	THAT IS HUGE!!!!!!!!|`|BWez86Ldaa	Hiya new rat lover! :D <br>  <br>  Go to <a href="http://www.rattycorner.com/odds/calc.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.rattycorner.com/odds/calc.sht...</a> which is the ratty cage calculator. Just enter the dimensions and there you go! There are several other calculators out there if you don't like that one. <br>  <br>  I love having more room for our kids' home, so we have one two story ferret nation (9 rats), and we're getting a second one soon to add to the family. Your cage is probably big "enough", but more room is always better, as I'm sure you already know :) <br>  <br>  Since you're new to rats, I suggest checking out www.goosemoose.com which has the best rat forum on the web, in my opinion. If you have any other rat questions (such as diet, exercise, toys, etc), I hope to see you on the forum, otherwise you can email me personally at piratecaptainloo@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aYjF2SOKaa	The cage is a fair size for the one rat :)<br>  <br>  But one thing though, I would seriously recommend covering the wire floors of the cage with old carpet or fleece, as rats are very susceptible to bumblefoot, caused by the irritation of wire floors in cages, it's very painful for your ratties and very expensive to treat. :)<br>  <br>  As for toys, store bought ones are often a total waste of money, an igloo-style house is a good idea, but other than that, from my experience most other toys get ignored. Making toys is much cheaper, and often, the toys are more fun for your rat.<br>  Why not try hanging an old toilet paper tube in the cage and hiding threats inside it? Or, use old shoe boxes filled with bedding for hidey-holes. Rats are very clever and finding new ways to stimulate them is not only fun for you, but it helps to ensure your new friend is kept busy whenever you're away :)<br>  I had one rat who would go crazy for an old bottle lid (or something similar) filled with peanut butter. :)<br>  Good luck and enjoy your new friend, she looks lovely :)|`|lhyE4qGxaa	Hello,  Yes this cage is big enough for two rats, I have seen a lot worse rat cages!  I have indoor aviarys for my rats but I have got 16!   Don't waste your money in buying hammocks from shops as they get weed on and chewed, used old clothes and tea towels, tie them on to the cage with hairbands to make them easy to change. Only buy plastic tunnels, and not cardboard ones and put any empty boxes into the cage as the rat will love to explore them and make beds in them.  Offer it lots of loo paper to make nests with.  Also do yourself and the rat the biggest favour and NEVER use wood sawdust, it just results in respitory problems.  Get some CAREFRESH bedding from pets at home.  It has no dust at all and stops the urine smell also.  Also make sure you offer your rat a little bit of your dinners, but never let it have access to citrus fruit as this is poisonus.  Have funnn!!!!!!!!  Rats are THE BOOM BANG BEST PETS!!!!!!!!!!!!
0ZrRRGmiaa	It sounds like a brown recluse spider... I can;t say for sure because I didn't see it but that would definatly explain the severe swelling.|`|Njb8xgKNaa	If you do not see improvement to the swelling after a few hours I would take her back to the vet.

GnUh4wUsaa	Felines, by nature, are more careful of their actions.  This is because of very basic instincts and natures of Canines and Felines.  Canines are more social, and in the wild, tend to live in packs.  Felines, with the exception of the Lion, prefer to be solitaire.  <br>  <br>  Because of this, felines have far greater consequences for being wreckless or spontaneous.  They don't have the strength of numbers to rely on.  Any small injury can doom their existence.  This basic instinct does translate into the domestic versions of felines and canines.  <br>  <br>  For example, when a dog is let into the house, he will usually be very excitable and marauding, especially if there are a number of people in the house.  If a cat is introduced into the same situation, they will often be very cautious, calculating the risks vs rewards.  <br>  <br>  I am an active predator hunter in Texas (as I am a rancher, and must eradicate Coyotes on a regular basis).  When calling for predators, Coyotes will often invade the area with confidence, where as bobcats will make you wait for hours before showing their presence.  This shows a much less spontaneous nature.|`|1j26uosiaa	We've had many dogs and cats over the years and I personally think dogs are more spontaneous as far as expressing their feelings. I can be gone five minutes to the mailbox and our dogs greet me like I've been away for a week while our cats don't even notice my absence. When it comes to enthusiasm, you simply can't beat a dog!|`|n6sZjwDqaa	I don't think one is more spontaneous then the other.... The living things like we are, it's all in the personality of the pet|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	It has nothing to do with the breed at all.A dig loves their owner NOT just  because he fieed and gives  him shelter and you will find even dogs who have beenmaltreatedd have still got some love for humans.Cats arecompletelyy different they are simply ones that are content to be fed and less spontaneous then dogs.Sure they will give you cuddle and kisses BUT on their terms not yours.<br>  A dog will give you all the love and attention whether spontaneous or not all the time whereas the cat dishes it out only when he feels like it which is usually tea time.l breed both so l can see the difference immediately,there is not questionmy siamese love me and will come to me when l call them but a dog will come all the time not just when they feel like it is unconditional love|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Cats are very calculated where as dogs are spontaneous & often hilarious at it.  Dogs are more entertaining to watch especially Whippets.

mFf8CqAraa	Short of buying a snake or lizard and turning it loose in your bathroom, I would spray some Raid behind your washing machine.<br>  <br>  I am not an expert on the lifespan of crickets but the chirping would drive me nuts.

4PY0bEQnaa	La lana en las ovejas, al igual que en los demás animales lanudos, está impermeabilizada por una cera llamada lanolina, que segregan las glándulas sebáceas.

342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Didn't your vet mention that your dog is most likely showing symptoms of cognitive dysfunction syndrome - the equivalent of alzheimer's.  It can take many forms - and what your dog's doing are pretty much classic symptoms.  I'd be finding a different vet because there are meds that can help.|`|MQJ8w56Qaa	If as you say, nothing as changed in the household or with his food and your dog is acting different then, something else is bothering him.<br>  <br>  The average life expectancy for cockers is 12.5 years old. Your doggie is definitely a senior. He may even have some senility developing. Try to be patient with him.<br>  <br>  Make sure he is eating the proper amount of food for his age and size.<br>  Make sure he has fresh water at all times.<br>  <br>  Gently touch/rub him all over slowly, feeling for any unusual bumps, lumps, etc.<br>  While rubbing him, he will surely yelp if you find a tender/sensitive spot that may have went unnoticed at the vet. <br>  Check his teeth too.<br>  <br>  It would be a good thing to walk your Cocker Spaniel everyday even if he has a yard. Since he is old, take him for a slow, short walk. He will love this and it may alleviate the problem he is having by mentally relaxing him.<br>  Cocker Spaniels are active and like to play games like hide and seek, fetch, if he still can.

The best way to stop it is ignore him when he does it.<br>  <br>  When you throw in the behavior at the fridge, though... that makes me wonder if there's something with it specifically that's bothering him?  Perhaps the motor has started making a high-pitched noise that is bothering him, but only he can hear?  Even his whining in other parts of the house could be related because high-pitched sounds like that can really carry.  Maybe try unplugging it for a couple of hours when he's being really obnoxious and see if his behavior improves?
IuYekkPVaa	Cats do grieve for the loss of a close companion and lack of appetite is a classic symptom of depression.  Have you tried tempting him with favourite food treats?  If he's refusing to eat anything at all, then you need to take him to the vets for a check up, because prolonged fasting can cause in fatal liver damage in cats. The vet can probably prescribe an appetite stimulant.<br>  <br>  The Messybeast web site has a really good article "When Cats Grieve" which has lots of information and advice on ways in which you can comfort your cat and help him to feel better.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.messybeast.com/cat-grief.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.messybeast.com/cat-grief.htm</a><br>  <br>  Hope he's feeling better soon.|`|inST4SlAaa	yes he is depressed.  play with him more.  buy one of those laser light toys and get him zipping all over the house.  exercise is very good for depressed animals.  give him some cat nip, that will make him feel good.  keep giving him all the love and attention that you have been giving him all along just try to add more exercise.  give him some cat treats.  you could also adopt another cat.he will get over it but he will need help from his loving family!!|`|iYzmnIsJaa	Yes.   As danmark  and Christina said,  get him to the vet if it's 2 - 3 days he hasn't eaten.  He is in danger and should at least get sub cutaneous fluids.  I highly recommend you take him NOW, even though it means an emergency room visit.  Because you do not want to take the chance of his organs shutting down.  You also want to be sure depression is not the only reason he's stopped eating.  His immune system may need a little help.  When you take him to the vet bring a long a tee shirt that smells like you, for him to snuggle into...<br>  <br>  If only 1 day he hasn't eaten:  Lots of water available.  Offer tuna water from can of tuna in water NOT oil.  Maybe a little tuna.  Or offer only the gravy from a chunks and gravy cat food, whatever his favorite flavors might be....   Normally, I stay away from that stuff because it's not all that healthy, but I use them to stimulate an appetite when one of my cats is sick.  Sometimes I roast a chicken breast basted with butter and cut it very finely, pour a little of the butter gravy over it....(boiled has next to no nutrients.)<br>  <br>  Think about getting another cat just a little younger and smaller than him, of the same sex as his littermate, with a less dominant personality than he has.<br>  <br>  Sorry for both of your loss.|`|A7XV2K3Paa	When her companion of 13 yrs died, my cat Kelsie was very depressed and stopped eating. It started as soon as she realized that he wasn't coming back. She dropped close to half her weight. The vets could only tell me to use Feliway and consider force-feeding her. I did find a holistic remedy that I believe helped her. It was called Pet Calm by Richard's Organics. It smells HORRIBLE. I started giving her some, and within 24 hours, I had a different cat. She was eating and more herself. I gave it to her for a few more days and then stopped (which she appreciated). Today, she is just fine, although her new companion (1.5 yrs) does annoy her at times!  Best wishes.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	I would think so. But be careful! I've read that cats can go into irreversible organ damage after two or three days of not eating. If what I read is true then keep close watch and consult a vet!!!!<br>  <a href="http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Animals.html" rel="nofollow">http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Anima...</a>|`|pT0SFrlFaa	danmark is right you should take him to the vet they know how to get him eatting again.|`|rpWO5vL4aa	Yes, a cat can absolutely become depressed, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. Studies have been done that prove that cats have the emotional capacity to become depressed. First things first, take your cat to the vet for a medical checkup! Not eating could be a serious symptom of something else. If he is given a clean bill of physical health, then you can safely assume it's his mental health. In that case, you need to do some really fun things with your cat to distract him. What does he really like? Take him outside on adventures if you can, that always works well. (On a harness and leash is what I do). Maybe buy him a few new toys, or go all out and build him a kitty condo from boxes or something. Play with him, give him lots of attention, maybe some favorite treats, and just let him know how great he is! Arrange "play dates" with other friendly cats if you can. This should lift his mood quickly! As a last resort you could potentially get another cat, but this MAY not solve the problem. Some older cats do not take kindly to a new cat. Base your decision on your cat's personality. I hope this helps, good luck!|`|aN4SUKkRaa	What were the circumstances?<br>  <br>  Was the now-deceased cat ill and euthanised at a vet, with the vet disposing of the body? If this happened, the other cat will think his mate just simply left, and it will stress about this. The cat should have been allowed to see the body, give it a sniff, whatever, so it realised its mate was dead. Sounds gruesome but!|`|cffdcb20e5793f81ec11b7d0c51ba7f6aa	100% yes....your cat is in mourning for his friend.  Give him lots of affection and love, try some favorite foods, but don't force them on him.  Keep plenty fresh water for him, he can go along time without food but not without water.

These people are not responsible dog owners, because if the dog can run out to the road to bother you, it could also run out and get ran over.|`|292620a1197fbd5bce83e12324c0abdeaa	I think I would avoid the area, sounds like the owners and nuts and there is no telling what they may do to you. They don't really seem to concerned about their dog either or that the aspca may do something to them. I would just stay away from the people and the dog before you or the dog end up hurt or worse.

It's too bad this dog is at risk of getting hit by a car because of incompetent owners.  <br>  <br>  Good luck and stay safe.|`|fa0d534647a0ce56b992769d58746425aa	I would definitly keep doing what you're doing.  It's not yoru fault the dog isn't on a leash!  They deserve a fine if they can't abide by any law.|`|AA12136244	It's a public road, and you have just as much right to ride on it as anyone else. If it's a secluded area though I would ask your local police to beef up patrols in the area, especially during the times that you will be riding by (give them your schedule and they can probably do that). Then if anything happens an officer will be nearby to assist you.<br>  Don't do anything to the dog, it's not his fault his owners are too stupid to train him properly. <br>  If you are of age and it's legal in your state you could also carry a gun. People always tend to steer clear of anyone with a gun. I always carry one when walking here in the city. One of the reasons I want to move to the country.

bDPVRtCNaa	What type of goldfish?<br>  <br>  Goldfish may be housed with other goldfish.<br>  <br>  Fancies should be housed together, not with common/comet goldfish. Fancies include black moors, ryukins, orandas, and fantails.<br>  <br>  Common goldfish and comets may be housed together.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	other goldfish maybe a weather loach|`|AA11449072	NONE! I know other people have done this but for the health of your goldfish and the other fish, don't mix them!<br>  Goldfish require different diets because they lack a stomach, goldfish food is not suited to any other type of fish and non-goldfish food is not suited to your goldfish. Goldfish also produce high amounts of ammonia which usually kills any other type of fish in there with them, not to mention they need a LOT of room; 20 gallons per fish to have a healthy THRIVING fish, not just a survivng fish. Unfortunatly when you have goldfish you can only have another goldfish with them.|`|Fx9bxZ8aaa	Goldfish should never be housed with anything other than other goldfish.  They are a cool water fish, so normal water is too warm for goldfish and too cold for tropicals.  They also have different slime coats from tropicals.  So they can pass too many diseases amongst each other.so the only choice is,well,more goldfish.|`|asXq2cFDaa	Depending on your tank size, you can keep any sort of minnow, and zebra danios also do well. These are all coldwater fish.<br>  Dojo loaches(In a tank of at least 75 gallons) Bristlenose plecos or rubberlip plecos(Both subtropical and can go well with godlfish) Or apple snails. <a href="http://www.kokosgoldfish.com/comfish.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kokosgoldfish.com/comfish.htm...</a><br>  All fish must be added after the tank is cycled.<br>  <br>  Edit:Yes goldfish require a different diet, more veggies.<br>  Bottom level sub tropical or coldwater fish are best, they can be fed separately, and most have a primarily veggie diet as well!|`|CqquoBy4aa	Molly Moon.  Looks like a black goldfish with big eyeballs.
CqquoBy4aa	No.  Goldfish are very bad to other fish and they won't react well.  One of the fish is going to die.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Yes, more goldfish so long as the tank is large enough and has very good filtration.<br>  <br>  -Fancy goldfish should be kept with other fancy goldfish.<br>  -Fancy varieties like bubble eyes, and celestials can be together because they are somewhat handicapped and other fish may harass them.<br>  -Common goldfish should be kept with common goldfish.|`|rrLHU6ehaa	Yes.|`|qcecsrDsaa	Goldfish and other cold water fish will be fine together. Just remember that the BIG fish might eat the little fish. Try to have a lot of plants for the smaller fish to escape and hide<br>  <br>  Goldfish are basically vegetarians, but they will swallow smaller fish if they can catch them.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|f8RBtCVAaa	yes even sometimes u can put them with warm water fish as long as there temperature lv is low and i mean in the lower 60's|`|kwIGcX8Oaa	Yes, they can.

5JNhV6Ovaa	Close contact and All purpose is saddle talk. <br>  <br>  And if your jumping I wouldn't suggest these saddle pads. They have a tendency to shift and you want your horse to be protected at all times. A regular saddle pad is better. But I see it all the time, it is just my preference. Everyone has their own taste.|`|x787hJbBaa	They are talking about saddle type there. If you have a close contact saddle get a close contact pad, but if you have an all purpose get an all purpose pad. There is probably a difference in thickness, but I doubt by much. See whether you have a close contact saddle or not.
c8eedbc3c9cf25e083d49bbbbfca90d8aa	The species, Hamster, has approximately  18 breeds.<br>  <br>  Two of the dwarf hamsters belonging to the genus Phodopus (Phodopus campbelli, Campbell's Dwarf Hamster, and Phodopus sungorus, the Winter White Russian Dwarf Hamster) and also two of the species of the genus Cricetulus, (Cricetulus barabensis, the Chinese Striped Hamster, and Cricetulus griseus, the Chinese Dwarf Hamster) have a dark stripe down the head to tail. The species of genus Phodopus are the smallest, with bodies 5 to 10 cm (about 2 to 4 inches) long; the largest is the common hamster (Cricetus cricetus), measuring up to 34 cm (about 13 inches) long, not including a short tail of up to 4 cm (1-1/2 inches). The Angora hamster, also known as the long-haired or Teddy Bear hamster, which is a type of the Syrian Hamster is the second largest hamster breed, measuring up to 15 cm (about 6 inches) long.<br>  <br>  Hamsters are stout-bodied, with tails much shorter than body length, and have small furry ears, short stocky legs, and wide feet. Their thick, silky fur, which can be long or short, can be black, grey, white, brown, buff, yellow, "sapphire" or red depending on the species, or a mix of any of those colors.|`|D7rZRTdDaa	theres panda hamster teddy bear hamster chinese dwarf hamster dwarf hamster robo hamster long-haired teddy bear hamster also theres alot more that i cant remember<br>  <br>  sorry|`|boOi7xJJaa	There are basically 5 types (species) of hamsters in the pet trade.<br>  Syrian (AKA Teddy Bear)<br>  Campbell's Russian Dwarf<br>  Winter White Russian Dwarf<br>  Roborovski (Russian) Dwarf<br>  Chinese Dwarf<br>  <br>  Rex is a coat variation that occurs in both Syrian and Campbell Dwarf.<br>  Each of the 5 species has it's own colors and pattern variations. <br>  Syrian hamsters get lots of different names, but they are all Syrians (see the link below)|`|IYd6bw7Gaa	I've never heard of or seen the Rex hamster but that doesn't mean it doesnt exsist.<br>  <br>  There are 4 types of Dwarf hamsters.  Roborovski, Chinese, Russian (Campbell's) and Winter White.  Then there are the Syrian hamsters.  These have many different names based on color and fur patterns but they are all basically the same breed.  These include TEddy Bear, Panda Bear, Black Bear, Golden and Fancy.  I've even seen furless hamsters called Naked hamsters.<br>  <br>  Personally I would go with a Syrian.  They are more tame than any of the dwarf breeds and live a little longer.  The downside is that they are solitary animals, so unlike the the dwarf hamsters you can only keep one in a cage.  The dwarf hamsters are very energetic and fun to watch.  SO it depends on what you are looking for in your pet hamster.  Cuddly=syrian.  energetic or more than one=dwarf
FQyeGsIyaa	I'd estimate $25 a month for food and litter - it can be more or less depending on what brands you go for - and $50 per year for a vet visit and a shot so that's $350 per year.  <br>  <br>  When you first get a cat you'll also need a carrier and litter box.  The prices for those can vary depending on what type you decide to get.  Plus, you'll need to have the cat spayed or neutered ($50-100 through a humane society) and the initial set of shots will be more costly.  <br>  <br>  Add onto that the cost of toys (lots) and treats.  I also keep a fund for pet emergencies.  Sometimes a cat will get sick and need an extra vet visit or treatment.  You should be prepared for this.<br>  <br>  I'd plan on $500 a year.  If you don't spend that much money one year, save it for another in case something happens to your cat (mine needed knee surgery) or to buy it something special like a cat tree.<br>  <br>  I only have 1 cat because I'm allergic to her and couldn't handle having a second cat.  She's very attached to me and I spend a lot of time with her.|`|5XYlHv6Paa	About $250-300 a year for food, litter, and some toys. He doesn't go to the vet, he's had all his shots in the beginning and was neutered and decalwed.|`|3RfHq80Naa	The vet will be between $60 and $150 depending on what you do, think 60 for spay/neuter, 60 for shots.  At Petco, they have half price vets on Sunday morning. <br>  I feed my cats each a can and a half of friskies which comes to 70c/day or $21 a month, $252 a year.  You can buy dry food for less, but I don't like what they put in it.   It's probably the same, but I prefer the look of the Friskies wet food.<br>  Litter box, $15.  Kitty litter, Johnny Cat 40lb works as well as Fresh Step but is much cheaper.  You'll only need one a month for one cat. $9 each so $84 for the year.  You can line the box with garbage bags if it's small enough.<br>  150+252+84= $486!<br>  It's not that much when you consider the love they give.

They love to be cuddled and pet, and also like to go for walks whenever you have time. They are inexpensive to keep although they are pretty pricey to buy. Although they cost around $800-$1000 themselves, their upkeep is only around $400+ yearly. They love to be spoiled and taken everywhere you go, but would be content in a sedentary lifestyle. I would recommend a Papillon for any family in this world. They are the perfect dog.<br>  <br>  The only drawback is if you are not a patient person. Papillons do not have a very strong bladder so therefore it takes about 3 months to house break these energetic puppies. I know that you would fall in love with a Papillon if you saw one in person. They are very loyal, and love to meet new people. Also, my Papillon, Pepe, loves all animals and gets along with other dogs, cats, small mammals, and even birds. <br>  <br>  Here are some links to pictures of Papillons. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images15/PapillonLimitIMG_0478_2.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/images15/Pap...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pedigreedpups.com/images/Papillon.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.pedigreedpups.com/images/Papi...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/swandive/337353076/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/swandive/33...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0WTefMIm6hJO1gAExqjzbkF/SIG=15irggq5b/EXP=1235872904/**http%3A//www.gotpetsonline.com/pictures-gallery/dog-pictures-breeders-puppies-rescue/papillon-pictures-breeders-puppies-rescue/pictures-photos/papillon-0049.jpg">http://rds.yahoo.com/_ylt=A0WTefMIm6hJO1...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elnfortinbras/433153613/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/elnfortinbr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/organa/244546191/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/organa/2445...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://roust.gotdns.com/animalsunlimited/images/f_papillon.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://roust.gotdns.com/animalsunlimited...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope that your family finds the perfect dog.

Your wants and expectations will determine what you should get.  You need to also determine how much exercise the dog will get, how much time you are willing to spend on grooming, training, how much drool or fur you can comfortably deal with, how much you can afford for vet care, food, bedding, grooming, etc.  Once you have answered these questions, you will be able to select a breed or mix that will fit into your expectations and lifestyle.

I would leave the tube sock which you should tie around the top of the tail, in for about two days then the day before you have the show, take the tail out of the sock and rinse well and comb well.<br>  As for the main I would wash it really well and then for a few days before the show, and put a slinky over the horses maine. This will cause no annoying haird that tend to stick up and it will also keep it clean of any enviormental debreas.|`|x787hJbBaa	Us QuickSilver, I half lease a 12 year old palomino gelding with two diagonal white socks (front left, back right) and a beautiful thick long tail and a gorgeous mane and a star and once I use that the white on him practically GLOWS!!! Cowboy magic is a good conditioner, but QuickSilver is a good thing to use for a whole body wash, mane and tail included. The only thing is the Quicksilver is purple. Don't let it discourage you... But it can dye your hands purple for a couple days, so use a curry comb or bathing mitt for when you bathe her body. You can't really do anything about getting it on your hands when you do her mane and tail. Also, periodic rinsing of your hands helps with not getting stained.|`|0cviGP2Haa	First wash the tail and mane with you regular shampoo then use Blue Shampoo or Quick Silver. Rinse it all out. Then use conditioner and rinse it out. When It is dry use Detangler and Shine (by Cowboy Magic) <br>  It makes it shiny and beautiful!! (plus really easy to brush)<br>  <br>  (For touch ups use Spray on Krud Buster by Cowboy magic)<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!!|`|CSx5MzBWaa	Cowboy Magic and Mane and Tail are IDEAL for de-tangling a tail; my sister and me generally washed my pinto's tail with regular shampoo, then used Show Sheen and Mane & Tail afterward, then braided it so it'd stay detangled until showtime.|`|m9ypuTViaa	an easy and effective way to get the tail clean is to fill up a bucket of soapy water and soak the tail in it. just hold the bucket under the horses tail and knead the tail with your hands. cowboy magic makes things very white btw|`|Fr6cE7QOaa	Just scrubbing and rinsing well and a brand iv'e used called Cowboy Magic seems to work well makes the mane.tail exspecailly soft to.

kwIGcX8Oaa	Sometimes fish just only have one baby because of birth problems and other things.Your black molly may not be done with giving birth just yet so keep an eye on her. You should have the babies in a separate net or in another small tank alone. If you do not seperate the babies from the other fish they will try to eat them. A bowl or just a small tank will be good for keeping the babies until they are large enough to swim with the others. Feeding the babies is as simple as crushing fish flake food into very tiny pieces small enough for them to eat. Sometimes you may have make some of the food float to the bottom so that they can eat it easier while its floating down. I hope his information helps you as much as u need it.<br>                                                                 ~Kalie|`|NwZ6yrq7aa	Yea for you!  baby mollies are fun!

In my first batch of babies I only found 2, 1 made it.  2nd time I found 4.  I recommend a breeder net, about $5, to hang on the inside of the tank.  1 baby should do fine it there.  Crush your flake food or get special fry food (First Bites).  When it's about 3-4 months you can release it into your main tank.
MQJ8w56Qaa	Sorry for the lengthy writing but it is all important to creating a great relationship between you and your dog from the start.<br>  <br>  You should probably leave the cage door open and allow her to go in and out as she feels comfortable. Have fresh food and water available close to the cage.<br>  <br>  You can help her to get comfortable with your presence by sitting next to the cage while the door is open, with your back or side toward her.<br>  Do not look at her face to face yet, that feels intimidating to a dog especially a fearful one.<br>  <br>  You do not need to talk to her, just sitting there quietly, not facing her will put her into a comfortable, more relaxed state of mind. This may take 20-30 mins. then when she is laying or sitting relaxed, just get up and walk away.<br>  Try this a few times if necessary till she comes out on her own.<br>  <br>  While getting to know her and her, you, you need to have a calm, assertive energy about you. This will also help her to feel at ease, knowing that her new leader is calm and strong.<br>  <br>  One thing you do not want to do is ignore unwanted behavior...if she growls, you can correct that with a stern control word, NO, STOP, etc.<br>  Use the control word everytime she growls, she will get the connection.<br>  <br>  Do not touch her or use her name when correcting unwanted behavior, just the control word.<br>  <br>  And very important, when she is acting nervous or fearful, definitely do not touch her to try and console her, dogs do not respond as humans would. Consoling a dog when they are doing something we want to change, has the opposite effect and actually reinforces the unwanted behavior and it then continues.<br>  <br>  And lastly, the most important thing you can do to get your new dog into a great mental state is to walk her as soon as possible, like tomorrow morning.<br>  Walking is what dogs do in nature and it s the best mental exercise for them.<br>  Walking her correctly is important as it decides who is the leader and who is the follower in your new pack.<br>  Your dog MUST walk next to or slightly behind you. Leader leads, rest of pack follows.<br>  Mastering the walk is the first thing you want to do. If you want to be considered the leader of the pack (which is the language dogs understand) you must be able to walk the dog with you in front and the dog next to or slightly behind you, because as the dog sees it, the leader is in front and the rest of the pack follows behind.<br>  <br>  You must also walk through doors first, in and out, before the dog.<br>  If he is leading you, then he will consider himself the leader and thus he will think that he can make the rules. Obviously this does not work except in a pack of wild dogs but your dog will not know the difference. They are really quite basic in their thinking, leader leads, rest of pack follows and waits for direction from leader. So your first mission is to master the walk and become the leader.<br>  <br>  You should start with the leash just long enough to allow the dog to be next to you comfortably, no longer. The dog will probably try to pull, you should tug on the leash when he does pull but immediately release. This tug is meant to distract him from pulling. If you continue to pull back, he will only pull the other way. So, tug, then release. You may have to also use a control word like NO or STOP. No other talking and do not use their name, just the tug and the control word. You must also remain calm because your dog will sense your energy. Your calmness will help the dog to remain calm.<br>  <br>  Practice this when the dog is calm. If he becomes excited on the walk, stop walking, allow him to calm down then begin again. Just start walking when he is calm, no words needed, just start walking, like the leader of the dog pack would do. You dog will eventually get this new way of walking. Some will get it immediately, some will take a few walks. If you are consistent, this works everytime.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cesarmillaninc.com/</a>|`|p7swtBYzaa	Poor dog, she must be traumatized.<br>  <br>  Don't try to force  her to come to you - don't walk "at" her - just sit and have some food in your hand, feed her at her own pace.<br>  If you make her come to you for food, she will recognize you as the good giver.   Don't try to rush her, this could take weeks until she feels safe enough to trust you - meanwhile, just let her be.<br>  <br>  Don't stick your hand in her crate - that's her space - and she may feel she needs to defend it - lure her out with food.<br>  <br>  I have dealt with many fear biters, I foster for a rescue.  Some dogs take longer than others, but the key is gentle, positive reinforcement in a quiet, stable environment.<br>  <br>  Be patient, feed her from your hand, let her come to you, never try to grab her if you don't have to.<br>  <br>  jrls - you have no idea what a crate is to a dog - it is their safe refuge - not a cage.  It should be warm with blankets and toys and open all day so the dog can go there if she needs to feel safe.<br>  <br>  <br>  The idea someone had to cover her crate is good, use a light sheet, I do that with my dogs at night.|`|p1ySkjSNaa	Two words: Cesar Millan|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Ok.  Have you got a big comfy cushion for the base?  If not she will need one. Then you will need a warm snuggly blanket to cover her/snuggle up to.  COVER the top of the crate all puppies are terrified of things they cannot see that may land on the crate, especially in the dark.  Also give her something of yours that you no longer need so she can relate it to you.<br>  <br>  You have started out the right way by talking to her & not reacting.<br>  You need to try & get her to let you stroke her & reassure her bear in mind she has been on a plane ride which has taken her away from everything she knew in life & she will be missing her littermates & mom. When you go to bed & leave her in her bed the first night you could try leaving a radio on to keep her company.<br>  <br>  Tomorrow you need to start the house training bit.  Spend lots of time with her stroking her (brushing is good for calming), give her lots of love & when she has got over the shock of flying she will chill & start inter acting with you.  Good luck.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	well first you should give her a night to relax after everything shes been throw. keep her in the cage put a blanket over it. keep the house quite keep the room dime. maybe have a night light on or something. put a stuffed animal or lots of blankets in there for her to cuddle with. shes more than likely scared of being taken from her mom and siblings. than put on a plain and brought to this strange new house.  in the morning take the blanket off open the door. let her come out on her own. sing to her talk to her, and once she comes out. try hand feeding her some food. so she will learn that you are here to help her not to hurt her.you can even try putting a ticking clock in the cadge with her to simulate her mothers hart beat. good luck and congratulations on your new family member|`|stMcVPCMaa	In addition to what fairywood says, also try using non-aggressive behavior with her; avoid looking directly at her and don't crowd her.  You can sit sideways near her crate without looking at her and see if she calms down.  Never bend over her or tower over her until she's comfortable with you.<br>  <br>  Make sure the crate is her safe haven where no one will bother her --but she has to come out for food and water.  <br>  <br>  If you let her get a little bit hungry, you can lure her out of the crate by tempting her with nice-smelling treats (try pieces of cooked chicken, canned tuna, or little bits of peanut butter). Don't pet her when she's scared, but when she calms down you can sweet talk her and try petting her by approaching her chin from underneath or her body from the side (approaching from overhead as we so tend to do can be very frightening), while watching her body language for cues that you're moving too fast for her.<br>  <br>  Just take it slow, never pet her when she's scared, and move along at her pace, and she'll be fine.|`|59298a7f6db60fd4ddef0cde608f8d24aa	I think what you are doing is good, you should continue to talk lovingly to her and use your tone to calm her.  Food is a good incentive also and she'll gain your trust soon.  Show her love and affection and she'll return that love to you a zillion fold.  Dogs are such a blessing as they<br>  show love unconditionally.<br>  She is still a puppy actually and will learn to trust you as you show her steadfastness and that you are in control, yet love her.<br>  Remember to give her room and time to come to you out of the cage, perhaps placing it in a room she can walk around in ( laundry room) and where she can return to it if in fear.<br>  I wish you so much happiness with your puppy.|`|2639c3Pcaa	Try your best to keep everything positive. Don't feed her alone in the crate. Have her eating from your hand. What work great on fearful dogs are positive reinforcement. If she behaves badly, don't reward it. It takes time to build a trust in a fearful dog. At this stage, I wouldn't attempt to pet, or cuddle with her. I don't want her to learn that being afraid means she will be cuddled. Keep your relationship with her very positive. I wouldn't attempt to confront her until she trusts me.|`|IPGxcmZxaa	positive reinforcement. buy toys.. ones with squeakers are best. find anything that will interest her enough to come out of her crate and over to you. treats are ok. you can work on training later, you need to get her to trust you first. then will come respect. you can just lie on the floor for however long it takes.. eventually she will come over to you. just leave her door open and go about your normal day.. she will eventually realize that you are the one who feeds her and that you are not harmful.|`|eznL5Zwvaa	Keep re-assuring her.Talk softly and carry lots of treats.You might want to try letting her out of the cage.She was couped up in a crate,shipped off in a loud airplane,no doubt shipped in cargo.I think I would be a little testy too.|`|c9f0740931db9fae8b18531d29aa0382aa	Indoor cage? How cruel. Let her roam free in your house, or don't have a dog at all.|`|R9qtysGqaa	A lot of factors come into play here. Is she a rescue?  If so that's the reason she is fearful. Either way you need to get her out of that cage.  I have a rescue Bichon and he wasn't comfortable w me for a month or so after I rescued him.  Never ever spank her. She will just be more fearful of her.  If she does something bad (potties on floor etc) tell her bad in a tone that says you disapprove and make her sit and stay in a corner or on a blanket on the floor for a time out.  Other than that just pet her and reassure her that she is safe and in a good home.  Constantly tell her she is a good girl and lot's of petting.
kjgonYlgaa	You have alot of good answers about the kinds of fish, setup, algae and stuff.  It will be cheaper if you get an aquarium starter kit.  As a rule you will have less problems with a larger tank, and they'll stay cleaner longer.  Small tanks can be 1-5-10-15 gallons but I'd suggest that you start with a 20 gallon, not too big but not too small.  I've seen them on sale at wal - mart (just passing through as I only shop there when it's my last resort) for about $80.00 (20 gallon) These kits include everything that you will need to start up your tank.  Gravel, plants, filter, heater, food, water conditioner etc...Some even come with an instructional video.  Just make sure that it's up and running for a while (I usually lets new tanks run a month) before adding fish .  I would also suggest that you invest in PH and Nitrate testers (about 10.00 each) .  Even if your mom's birthday is soon you can get and set up the tank without fish.  They're still pretty.|`|7L60FeYxaa	You're doing the right thing in trying to learn BEFORE you get the fish. Just a word of warning, if this sun room gets real sunny, algae will grow.<br>  <br>  As I'm also trying to learn beforehand, I can't tell you much, but from what I have found out, I'm thinking of getting a school of Zebra Danios. I'll probably get a larger tank than what you're looking for, but I think you should start with a 10g/20L tank and get a few White Clouds.<br>  <br>  Be sure to have plenty of money to start up this, because the heater, tank and filter can amount to plenty of money. I'd try and have a budget of around $150 and buy you tank, filter, heater,  substrate and fish with that. Then add stuff after that such as decorations and plants.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your fish!|`|CqquoBy4aa	You should get guppies or maybe goldfish.  You need to have a filter.|`|lbyX0GOJaa	neon tetra or goldfish there commutative.|`|QRCQJF6Faa	Best bet is to start with a small gold fish bowl and one or two goldfish. They are not very sensitive to the temp changes and are easy to care for. You will still need to clean the bowl and water each week and add the right chemicals so the water is good for them but for the most part they are the easiest to start with. When you go to the pet store tell them the same thing you told us and they will get you a kit for under 30 bucks or so and you should be set. Food and supplies might run about 20 bucks a month or less.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!<br>  Adam-O|`|p1gzHgAraa	well before you go buying a tank, i recommend you research a few key things that are really important about fishkeeping. Read up on how to cycle a tank-its called nitrification cycle. Its the process where you take bad bacteria, and over some time it is converted to good beneficial bacteria which your fish need to survive. <br>  <br>  i suggest you get on some fish forums and begin reading the "beginner" sections-in order to have healthy fish you need to know some important steps.<br>  <br>  as far as tank size, going small isnt always easier! i would pick something like a 55 gallon tank. use sand as a substrate (or gravel)-<br>  <br>  you can buy a heater, but do NOT put your tank in direct sunlight! you will boil your fish, and green algae will overtake the tank. Keep your tank temp around 78 degrees. i would start with some starter fish.. mollies, swordtails, neons, and some other community fish. <br>  <br>  use a good water conditioner-i use something called Prime-it neutralizes heavy metals and toxins. and you must do a waterchange every week or every other week of about 50 percent..<br>  <br>  now that youve read all this, you should see that there is quite alot to fishkeeping-and i havent even touched the beginning... get on some fish forums and read up.. here are the ones i use:<br>  <br>  www.monsterfishkeepers.com<br>  The Skeptical Aquarist<br>  tropicalfishchat.net<br>  cichlidforum.com
AA12327015	Get her her own litter box. ALWAYS keep it clean. I scoop mine twice a day. If you use scoopable litter, you don't always have to change the whole litter just scoop out the waste. Fresh Step Scoop is the best!<br>  <br>  Or she may have a bladder infection. Check w the vet.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	Oh boy. Yeah I have a suggestion. I hope I can say it alittle delicately.<br>  <br>  Back in 1989 I had two litter mates, Lucas and Ted E. Bear. They always would only poop and pee under my Mom's bed. Can you imagine her trying to sleep? Anyway, nothing would work. Finally I got an idea from a Disney movie about a guy who went out in the wild with his camera to study the wolves. While there he noticed that they would urinate around his camp at different places to mark "their" borders. Then he got the idea to "mark" his. LOL. It took him 28 cups of tea (or something like that) and hours to walk around his camp and do the same. The wolves then went around and sniffed the guys markings... and everyone knew their place! <br>  <br>  Then I got the idea to try the same thing with my two kittens who would only do duty under Mom's bed. So I put my scent on TP, and did the other thing too and put it in a clean litter box. Then put Lucas and Ted E. Bear into the box. They immediately noticed my scent. It was almost like "wow, daddy's scent is in here so must be this is the place to do ours too!". Of course they are both gone now. But if you want to see their photos they are on my site. And Lucas is my avitar here.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it DID work! So perhaps try it. It is gross but sometimes you have to speak in animal language. And scent they understand. So if you are not offended, why not try it. :)<br>  Good luck.<br>  <a href="http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Animals.html" rel="nofollow">http://gastricbypass.homestead.com/Anima...</a>|`|3RfHq80Naa	First, make sure that the litter box is clean.  Some cats are more sensitive to this than others.  Maybe you'll have to get her her own litter box.<br>  Then, show her the new litter box.<br>  If she still does it, grab her and shove her nose in it, and yell.  Then, bring her to the litter box and say, "this is where you go."  You may also want to spray her with a squirt bottle with water with her face in the mess.<br>  That kind of behavior is unacceptable.  Unless she's a retarded cat, and I'm sure they exist, she can figure out how to use the litter box.  Don't let up until she does.|`|cffdcb20e5793f81ec11b7d0c51ba7f6aa	If the two are having to share the same litter box that could be the problem....she wants her own, private box.  So buy a new litter box and keep it just for her, in a private place so the other cat does not use it.  Also....keep it clean.    I hope this helps....
1tX7KwHsaa	As an experienced barrel racer and the description you have of your horses hard mouth I would try this bit but do a lot of flat work before heading to the arena and do so gently!  Basically the  rope nose band has a small mouthpiece for more control,  Rein pressure contacts the nose first the gently picks up the mouth until the curb tightens for gentle “all over” nose, bars, lips, chin and face control .*** I also wanted to add too that this bit will gather and collect a horse from the NOSE before getting to their mouth! So a little goes a long way with this bit!*** You will have to try it with light hands as well as the twisted snaffle may harden your horses mouth even more if he is resistant to it.

With two sets of reins, the gag bit gives a rider the ability to use either a standard direct action or a gag action. In this, the gag bit is related to a Pelham bit and a double bridle. Unlike these, however, the gag bit has no curb strap.<br>  <br>  Some styles of gag bit are integral to a special bridle, known as a gag bridle; others are used with a standard bridle. Inside the horse's mouth, the gag bit may be jointed like a snaffle bit or smooth like a Mullen mouth bit.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gag_bit.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Gag_bi...</a><br>  gag snaffle<br>  <br>  Dutch gag<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:3-ringgagbit.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:3-ring...</a><br>  <br>  American gag<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Americangagbit.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Americ...</a><br>  I persobally think this is the one you are talking about<br>  <br>  The gag bit works on the horse's lips and poll simultaneously. The pressure on the lips tends to make the horse raise its head, which is useful for a horse that tends to overextend. Polo players, who necessarily ride with the reins in one hand and cannot make instant fine adjustments, often use a gag bit with draw reins. The reins are adjusted such that, when the horse tucks in its nose, the gag action ceases automatically.<br>  <br>  Gag bits are used mainly for horses that are strong pullers or for horses that need retraining. Gag bits are most commonly seen in polo, eventing (especially for cross-country), show jumping, and hacking, mainly for increased control at times where a horse may be excited or try to run off with the rider.<br>  <br>  They are not permitted at any level of dressage, since dressage riders are trying to get the horse come down onto the bit, and want to encourage the horse to accept contact. Additionally, the horse is supposed to be completely submissive in dressage, and a gag bit gives the impression that it is not. Gags are also never seen in the hunter arena, again because they wish to portray that the horse is an easy ride, and because they want a long, relaxed frame with the neck stretched out, rather than a high neck.<br>  <br>  Gag bits are also occasionally seen in western-style competition, usually in the form of a sliding mouthpiece on a shanked curb-style bit (similar to the American gag).<br>  <br>  <br>  It is commonly seen in western style
a6dbd9f27896f7a431d497c0ae420256aa	my lexi cried the first night we brought her home <br>  <br>  we put her in a crate at first next to our bed and she still cried so we took her out. Let her potty outside again and then she slept with us and she has been sleeping with us the last yr. <br>  <br>  Don't give the puppy to much space depending on the size a bathroom is to large give him raw hides and a special toy for night time use.  <br>  <br>  When you are with him don't give him, the same thing you would use for night. There are Interactive toys and then there are self play toys|`|p7swtBYzaa	Try putting soft toys and blankets in with the pooch - and cover the crate with a light sheet.<br>  A big chewie might help too - sometimes it takes a while until the dog is used to the crate.<br>  Why don't you put the basket he likes inside the crate?|`|fMRcX2WDaa	go in the bathroom and lay down with him until he falls asleep. than quietly tip toe out and go to sleep once he wakes up hell wake you up to.|`|R9qtysGqaa	Does he have any toys in there?  I'm currently dealing with a similar problem.  I have found the only thing that works is to distract them.  Bones, rawhide's, balls... any thing to keep him busy!  Good luck!|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Try putting a radio on low, he will think he has people wandering about the house.  Also try giving him something warm & cosy to sleep on. If you have something that belongs/smells of your brother that could calm him down too.  Good luck|`|WOxxbQFsaa	he probably feels lonely so u should just give him a safe feeling by putting stuff that smells like ur brother inside his basket and then hell probably go to sleep.|`|yyf5N7Ogaa	In addition to the toys, try putting an old fashioned clock that ticks in the room. It is a very soothing sound. Put the basket with him ion the bathroom. You DON'T need to put the poor little thing in a crate. That will only make it worse.
2639c3Pcaa	Why are you training her to pee on pads? This is why people are having issues with housebreaking indoor. The best way to do is take your puppy outdoor every 30 minutes and try not to let her have any accident indoor. When you are being consistent with housebreaking, then she will quit pooping/peeing indoor.|`|746YLjISaa	Your min pin dosent know she has to poop untill it is already coming out of her butt. You need to take her to a place where she cant get disracted, and she will eventually go potty.|`|UYEuqEp7aa	You were supposed to make the ice cubes out of fruit juice, instead of boring water.|`|f00bda58ec68f0473300147e8bbc12c0aa	I had the same problem with my mini dachshunds. You just have to take them outside ever half hour so they don't go inside because they will not wait for you to let them out. When you see them going in the house just startle them so they stop and then put them outside so they can finish, and when they finish outside give them a treat or something so they know that they did good. Do not rub their faces in it or anything like that because it hurts your dog and they will often become afraid of you. Whenever your dog goes to the bathroom outside give it a treat and make sure to give it praise so they know that they did what they were supposed to. You can even try putting the pads outside. It works sometimes.
0RBiVF20aa	Yes he's spraying, and the odor is different because of the ammonia content in cat urine as opposed to human urine (which is mainly urea). If you get a black light, and turn out the other lights in your home, every where he has marked will fluoresce. I recommend OUT! or another brand of pet odor neutralizer (pet section of the store) which actually uses enzymes to chemically dissolve the ammonia. This will help stop him from re-marking the area after he is neutered. If you haven't neutered him because of cost, e-mail me, and I can help you find low cost neutering in your area.|`|cffdcb20e5793f81ec11b7d0c51ba7f6aa	I doubt that he is spraying...you'd know if that was what he was doing.  He could have a little bladder infection or maybe his hormones are starting to work and he is getting excited when he is getting petted or getting attention.  I think I would check with your vet, the smell thing makes me think it is more of an infection going on.<br>  <br>  Good luck....cat lover Kathy|`|aN4SUKkRaa	Marking his territory. Toms don't piss on everything. it appears that way though. When he is neutered, the pheromones that product the musky smell are stopped. When he does urinate it stills stinks to high heaven but if he is house-trained he won't stink up the inside!|`|pfXrQqVxaa	Yes.  A few years back, I acquired a stray male cat who was about 2yos. that did the same thing.  When I got him neutered, he just stopped.  At 7mos. it is safe to get your cat fixed.|`|ZQJfkGwJaa	Seven months old is WAY time to go get him neutered. The smell will more than likely stop...|`|8GVEqyPmaa	It could very well be a problem with his anal glands. Have him checked ...and neutered.|`|RN1wGlWWaa	It could be related.  Why is he not neutered.  He could start spraying any day now.  Should have been done at 3-4 months old.  Call your vet now and have him neutered.|`|fgxajTiBaa	Neutering will stop the spraying. Intact males smell awful.|`|3RfHq80Naa	Spraying may stop once neutered but there's no guarantee.<br>  My cat had a blood clot that was preventing him from peeing normally, so when he's try, only a few drops of really smelly pee would come out.  It could also be a urinary tract infection.  A lot of unneutered males get them.<br>  You should take him to the vet just to be sure.  And if it's not either of those things, you can save the trip and get him neutered while you're there.|`|inST4SlAaa	yes he is spraying and neutering will stop it.  i bet he is shaking is tail when you dint realize it.  my male would just stand with his but facing the furniture and without squatting he would shake just a little bit and very quickly.  it is hard to get rid of the smell|`|rXMTdUg4aa	You should get him neutered to be responsible... not just because he is pissing in your house. But yes, this should stop his spraying.|`|rU7ZjIHKaa	Uhhhh....yeah...thats not urine...Oh man, how do I say this...Anyway, get him neutered and you won't have the problem any more.
aO8iBKkZaa	We have a female boxador also and we were worried about her weight as a puppy.  She did look a little thin and you could see her ribs just a little bit as a puppy.  The problem was, she was more interested in playing or being petted than eating and she also was pretty energetic.  This seems to be common with lab/boxer mixes.<br>  <br>  We decided to free feed her (always have food available in her bowl) rather than the suggested 3 meals a day and taking up whatever is not eaten after about 20 minutes.  This method worked well for her and we still free feed now that she's two years old.  Anytime her food bowl is empty, we simply fill it up and she eats whenever she's hungry.  She has maintained her weight perfectly so far.  By the time she was about 6 months old she filled out fine and you could feel her ribs, but could no longer see them.<br>  <br>  I initially was worried that free feeding would make housebreaking more difficult, since puppies tend to go to the bathroom not long after eating, but she developed a routine schedule of having to go to the bathroom, even though she ate whenever she was hungry.<br>  <br>  As long as the vet thinks she's healthy, just make sure you have a good quality dog food always available and if she overeats or gains too much weight, go back to scheduled meals and portions.<br>  <br>  Good luck and enjoy your sweet new puppy!  <br>  <br>  If you want to see pics of our boxador as a puppy (Haley the Boxador), check out <a href="http://brandonflayler.com/haley" rel="nofollow">http://brandonflayler.com/haley</a>|`|6SeWCfUfaa	Meh to all the negative people who aren't answering your question.<br>  <br>  If the dog takes after the boxer side, she will stay pretty thin and muscular looking.  It's not uncommon for these dogs ribs to show though a bit even though they're being fed correctly.  It's actually worse to have a fat dog than a dog that's a little underweight, just like with people.  So long as she's got a shining coat and eyes, is energetic and playful and doesn't look like a walking skeleton, she's fine.|`|KfBk9UMraa	Feed her by what the bag says. It may be that her food isn't good quality. Examples that are: Iams and Blue Buffalo. Purina is good, too but is said to make dogs over weight faster. If she is super active feed her move.<br>  <br>  The best bet her is to weigh her at a vet's office. Most will weigh you animal for free. Then, ask them how much you should fee her. The vet office can help you, even just by a phone call. After doing that if she is still skinny take her in for a vet check. She could have worms. <br>  <br>  Good Luck<br>  <br>  I forgot to mention, if she takes more after Boxer, shes always gonna look skinny but not where you can see every bone. The back-bone, tail and hip bones should never be seen. The ribs are okay, but really shouldn't be seen in boxers.|`|KvUJZa1Paa	You have a mutt, there is no such breed as a boxador. go by what is written on the bag according to weight of puppy, and make sure you feed him/her a good quality puppy food.|`|p1ySkjSNaa	Two words: Cesar Millan|`|ox2UMr1Haa	I have a BOXADOR too (yeah I said Boxador) Ignore all the boring comments on whether it's a real breed or not. It's really getting boring. Get over it. So long as the dog is wanted and loved is all that matters. Now back to the question - My Boxador is now 11 mths and is quite large without being fat. My dog also has a skinnier tummy but very strong muscles at chest and legs. I fed my dog 3 meals a day until around 6 mths old and am still feeding twice a day. My dog is not overactive but does get walked an hour or more each day. Training daily for around 10 minutes and again for 1 hour once a week. If you google "boxador" images you will see they are very varied in their look and size.  Hope this info helps.  Enjoy your dog, with love and training they are enormously satisfying and obedient dogs to own. We love ours.|`|JlLJQ5lgaa	As a pup mine did look slender, and he filled out by around 18 months.  You shouldn't be able to see her ribs through her fur, but you should be able to feel them when you run your fingers over her sides.  Don't let people talk you into overfeeding her!  Keep her fit.  More than anything, she needs to romp and play and learn the rules of the house and have games that keep her mind occupied.  Have fun with your pup!|`|eznL5Zwvaa	Has she been checked for worms?|`|426c98c5e6499e1f282c417b905cea60aa	You mean a boxer/lab mix puppy right? ....No such thing as a "boxador".<br>  <br>  If she is very active you'll want to feed her a little more then it suggests on the bag.  She should not look anorexic, though if she's taking on more of the boxer traits, she will be a little bit on the skinny side.  The bag lists only suggestions, if you think she's way too skinny even though she's eating a lot, bring her to the vet.  There may be something wrong or she may have worms.
LAXxaxAZaa	My gelding does this every time my mare is in heat. It isn't normal gelding behavior, but it does happen. I would have his testosterone levels tested if you're concerned. Is it possible whoever told you he was gelded at 6 months wasn't telling the truth? Late gelding could also cause this behavior.|`|n2dUmfcQaa	i would get him checked out, but at the barn i board at there was a gelding that was a stud and he got in mare, and everyone was scared. but the mare was checked and nothing happened, but while the vet was there she said that if he new once to do it, he will keep doing it, and sometime gelding that where stud know what there feeling for rather than just a gelding so they can get it in farther! gross right|`|5JNhV6Ovaa	Look up improper gelding. Separate them, call the vet and him tested, and while your at it give her a preg test. I have a mule pony that was the same way, he had improper gelding. The vet later went in and fixed it up.|`|UIM8X38Oaa	Are you sure he is gelded?<br>  Doesn't sound like it to me <br>  you might want to get him checked out.|`|TSc8OE4vaa	Are you sure he isn't a cryptorchid?  <br>  <a href="http://www.equine-reproduction.com/articles/cryptorchid.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.equine-reproduction.com/artic...</a><br>  <br>  Cryptorchids have a retained testicle that is inside of the body and is difficult to remove during gelding.  It is possible that this is causing some "studdy" behavior.  In any case, clean off your mare's privates to insure she doesn't get an infection and separate him until your vet can confirm he's not a cryptorchid.  You can just ask him next time he's out to check the donkey.<br>  <br>  I have seen geldings do this before though, that's why it's better to separate geldings and mares.  It could be normal gelding behavior.|`|FLBCvJuDaa	Not normal, but does happen.

You can even try getting one for free off of craigslist also look at the pets section when your ready. <br>  <br>  But if you really want to save this guy,  Fill up a bucket half way full of hot water from the tap then take some of your cycled cold water to balance the temperature.  Use your thermometer to see if the temperature is around 73-78 degrees.  Set your heater and drop it in the bucket.  Then hook up your filter to the bucket.   Don't forget to use a de-chlorinator of some sort.  Don't worry about the pH it should be good.  Then float the bag on the surface of the water to acclimate the fish to the new water or you can take a pitcher or something and float him in that so he has a chance to get some air at the surface if you're worried about him depleting his oxygen supply.  <br>  <br>  If your tank was new return it and tell them it was defective and you want a new one.  If that doesn't work then just get a new tank.  <br>  <br>  Sorry this is happening to you,  I hope it all works out.|`|QrjjiOgTaa	the store will probably not hold the fish for you. get the tank warm fun out and buy cycle, stress zyme, stablize, or biozyme and follow the directions. add some stree coat too. don't over feed (like one tiny feeding every other day) dont do any h20 changes (unless your ammonia or nitrite is over the moom) dont change the carbon. slowly acclimate him to the new tank. add aquarium salt to the water to ease the fish and reduce th side effects of high nitrite which might happen. goof luck|`|oJoYk2Ataa	Go back to the fish store and ask them to hold your oscar for you ^^<br>  <br>  Hope ur oscar lives :)|`|p1gzHgAraa	i would add warm water to the tank to raise the temp to around 78 degrees. add a good conditioner like Prime, and i would go to the fishstore and ask them if you can get some of the water squeezed into a bag from their filters (yeah it looks really bad- but it will save your fish) and pour it in the tank-in a few hours it will start to seed in your filters and bloom. <br>  <br>  or if you know someone with an established tank squeeze one of their filters in your tank -ive done that before in an emergency case. <br>  <br>  be prepared for an ammonia spike-do small waterchanges-best of luck, the little guy may not make it.|`|KnRKtrBLaa	Get stress coat and put two cap fulls in the water.|`|CqquoBy4aa	Get someone to hold it.
FfBll2n8aa	No it doesn't. It does, however, contain a lot of calcium so when the urine dries, you're left with a white chalky residue. I suppose this could fool some people into thinking the colour has been bleached out of the fabric.<br>  If you get any rabbit urine on your clothes or furniture (or floor), wash it out before it dries - on some surfaces it can be difficult to get the calcium residue out once it dries.|`|tTP8KA2Oaa	well actually I wouldn't know just because ive never tried it... but, in ancient times, i forget if it was greek or roman, they used human urine as detergent for clothing. I dont know if the rabbit urine would be any different, but I'm guessing its not.

Since I don't know exactly what area you live in it's hard for me to give you a proper list of breeds. Some breeds that are rare in one area are often quite easily found in another. For example, the Shiba Inu is extremely hard to find where I live in Kansas but is easily found in bigger cities in states like Colorado or California. <br>  <br>  A few of my favorite breeds that are rare in my area are:<br>  *Shiba Inu<br>  *American Eskimo (I finally found and own one)<br>  *Airedale Terrier<br>  *Visla<br>  *Keeshond<br>  *Akita<br>  *Chinese Shar Pei<br>  ***Mind you these aren't my favorites for temperament, just looks. You should really pick a dog that suits you and your lifestyle. From personal experience I know that picking a dog just because it's cute can turn out badly if you and that breed aren't a good match.<br>  <br>  I've included a link to a website that has lots of information on all different breeds of dogs. It has ratings from people who have owned the breed, and it has reviews and tips from those owners. It's really a great site if you're having a hard time figuring out what breed is best for you.<br>  The second site I've listed also has a lot of information on not only pure bred dogs, but hybrids as well.

I have read that to best know the personality of a wolf hybrid is to determine the breeds crossed and read up on their individual personalities.<br>  <br>  Wolf-hybrids are said to be skittish and difficult to train because of their wolf nature.  <br>  <br>   A Wolf-hybrid can be quite skittish and does not respond well to inanimate objects, fast motion, loud noises, or new people. They require much patience.  Training is not for the weak and serious consideration should be given prior to obtaining a wolf-hybrid dog as they require firm, consistent training and ample space to roam.  If there's something you find foul and offensive you can bet a wolf dog will roll happily in it and coat themselves in the funk! It is not until a Wolf Hybrid is about 18 months of age, that it will start showing signs of the wolf. Wolfs younger than 18 months of age are adolescents, they are playful and adaptable. They take directions readily and can bond with other species. Young wolves act more like the common dog as they have not developed into maturity. As a wolf grows out of its adolescents, its hormonal system reaches maturity and it will begin to exhibit all of the typical behaviors of the wolf.|`|69db0d5ccec58bb73a9f00ca229fe9d5aa	i know there dangerous but id still like to have one<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  g|`|8b4d22d151235f1759cc6721c0505e62aa	My housemate has a dog named Bear, who is a wolf hybrid. He is 30% wolf, with most of the wolf ancestry coming from a full-blooded grandparent. The rest of Bear's genetics comes from the German Shepherd.<br>  <br>  In telling you about him, remember that I am giving you only one example. Dogs are different in personality and genetics, and the breed crossed with wolf will have a significant impact--if you were to use a Lab instead of a GSD, you'd have really different results.<br>  <br>  Bear is a one year old neutered male. His personality: Very energetic, very enthusiastic. He is also very intelligent--he's learned to open gates and doors, and in wrestling with the two other dogs, he's learned the trick of grabbing their collars in order to get a good hold on them. He's got basic obedience signals down pat, all except for "stay", which he understands but doesn't always obey.<br>  <br>  Raised with another puppy, a gentle Lab mix, Bear is relatively good at relating to other dogs. He can inhibit his bite, understands the difference between play-fighting and real aggression, and knows all the social signals dogs use to establish a hierarchy. With people he knows, Bear is friendly and rambunctious. He has yet to be trained out of the habit of jumping on people--a real problem since, at 100 lb. with some weight yet to go, Bear is a big dog who could hurt frail or small people with sheer enthusiasm.<br>  <br>  From the information above, Bear could be any big, energetic breed with a strong, dominant personality. His dififculties come from his wolf side.<br>  <br>  In dealing with other dogs, Bear is often fearful. He's often bullied at the dog park because other dogs come up to him, exhibit dominance, and walk all over him--he's too frightened of new situations to feel the confidence needed to project an attitude that says "equal" or "dominant" to another dog.<br>  <br>  However, with the dogs he knows, Bear generally tries to be dominant. Our wily 4-year-old hound used to be top dog until Bear began growing up and understanding how big and strong he was. Lately, they have been in a rivalry, with Bear almost sure to win alpha status eventually, with our hound retaining a sort of alpha-female position. This won't be a problem when the new position settles in; but our hound is still sore about being deposed, and Bear not quite sure of how to act as a top dog; so things are shaky right now, causing an air of uncertainty among the dogs. We have had to separate Bear and the hound a few times already.<br>  <br>  People in general scare Bear. On walks, he is frightened of the people he meets. However, while he has a very strong primary attachment to his owner, he can become used to new household members after a few weeks. He will take commands from people other than his owner; but only his owner can teach him a new command, despite his intelligence.<br>  <br>  Bear still has an unfortunate habit of mouthing folks' hands in play. He has never bitten down, but his enthusiasm and fast movements can easily result in bruses he doesn't intend. His owner is the only person who is truly dominant over him; the rest of us are only obeyed because Bear knows she wants him to obey us.<br>  <br>  Bear isn't a good watch dog, except that his size and sharp teeth can intimidate visitors. He doesn't bark very much, so he doesn't warn of intruders (though he's aware of them, comes to the fence, and lets our Lab mix do the barking). He has never bitten anyone.<br>  <br>  Bear is still young--at one year old, he is an adolescent who won't reach his full size for another year. His temperament is also only just forming; and he has a rather worrisome fearful streak which could, if not tempered by a calm, consistent owner, result in fear aggression down the road. He also tends towards dominance--signaled by the mouthing and jumping--and this also needs to be dealt with.<br>  <br>  Wolf hybrids are not for beginners. Bear needs very consistent training, a lot of exercise, a lot of attention; and even then, we don't know how he'll turn out when he's fully mature. And he's only 30% wolf! Needless to say, I would not suggest owning a wolf hybrid to anyone who has not in the past owned other big dogs with strong personalities--Huskies and such--and knows exactly what he is getting into.<br>  <br>  There are alternatives to wolf hybrids which are just as intelligent, less fearful, and less prone to training problems; many dogs have the look of their wolf ancestors while still being domestic dogs. Bear's domestic half--the German shepherd--is one such example of a dog just as intelligent as a wolf-dog, with an appearance similar to a wolf. You could also try other big herding and working breeds, or mixed breeds with the look and temperament you want.<br>  <br>  All in all, Bear is a fascinating animal; he wouldn't be who he is without the streak of wolf in his genetics. However, if he were all German Shepherd, he'd be just as good a pet, and probably a better guard dog and socializer, than he is with his wolf blood. We'll take Bear the way he is; and we like him for who he is; but still, being partly a wild animal can be troublesome to a domestic dog.
be5454fb12c46b901784029087015a7eaa	yea man the paper<br>  <br>  <br>  n|`|0b6691be66651a8e0f44ae92e9fce0a2aa	Hi there...I assume you mean a hybrid wolf dog breed?  If it's wolves, many regions do not legally allow pet ownership of these exotics and for those areas that do, there are USDA/APHIS permits and licencing required, which is very expensive and difficult to maintain for those who do not follow with drop-in inspections and bi-annual exotic vet records (not a regular vet) to submit to the regulatory agency doing the inspections. Exotic pet ownership is quite different than typical pet ownership and by law exotics must live in a large enough and secure cage/enclosure with proper necessities for the exotic passed by USDA/APHIS inspections which is to also ensure the public's safety.<br>  <br>  To learn what permit/licences you require, you will need to contact your state wildlife agency for state requirements. Also check your county government for information on licensing and zoning. And if you are within city limits, you may need city agency licensing also. On a federal level you will need a U.S.D.A. license issued through APHIS (Animal and Plant Heath Inspection Service). They will have an inspector come out and see your enclosure prior to approval. Through them you will need to keep records of diet, vet care, and have annual inspections (also subject to "drop" inspections throughout the year) prior to renewal. They also require that your EXOTIC vet make at least biannual visits. The other regulating agency is U.S.D.I. (U.S. Dept. of Interior). They require licensing on endangered species only.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here's a listing of wolf hybrid puppies (I hope you did your homework on these): <a href="http://www.pets4you.com/wolf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pets4you.com/wolf.html</a>|`|69db0d5ccec58bb73a9f00ca229fe9d5aa	look in the paper there allways in thier<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  g
nawVCebbaa	There really is no way to just look at a young iguana and tell if it is a male or female.  The only time you can tell is after they have reached sexual maturity, between the ages of 1 1/2 - 2 years.  If you examine your lizard, along the hind legs, there are several pores called the femoral pores.  For males when they are mature, the first few pores will be very noticable and exposed, usually only up to 4 of them.  For females, mostly all the pores will be exposed.  In my experience, this has been the best way to tell.  <br>  Or also, you can very briefly hold your lizard up to the mirror.  If it is a male, he will extend his dewlap (the flap of skin under their heads), and begin to start "bobbing" his head and maybe start jerking his head around a bit.  This is the behavior of a male trying to maintain its role as the dominant male.  If a female...little to no reaction.  9 out of 10 times, this method will confirm the gender of your iguana.|`|osrqpU2Taa	Hello depends on their age...small one's generally get anally probed by experts...adults their color often gives away if their male or female...& females will lay eggs even if they aren't viable/any good ...they are generally all green where the males have orange or coral on their faces... larger spines & dew flaps ! Take Care :)|`|0FVj9z7Naa	Males<br>  <br>  Physical Characteristics - At maturity, males show several secondary sexual characteristics. One of the most easily identified is the large jaw muscles on either side of the lower jaw, below the ear. These muscles produce large, swollen-looking "jowls". Males have large, blocky heads, and the jowls add to this effect. Males also have two fatty deposits on their forheads, behind the eye and above the ear. These also add to the size and blocky shape of the head :)<br>  <br>  Females<br>  <br>  Physical Characteristics - The easiest way to identify a female iguana is by the absence of male secondary sexual characteristics. Their heads are smaller and more streamlined, and lack the fatty deposits behind the eyes and the more pronounced jowls :)<br>  <br>  If you don't like this info, visit the website below :)|`|5f511934873bdbb82f2c0830303c218eaa	its a little harder with young inguanas  but if you got a juvenile  look at its back legs   if it had little pores  along the back outside of the legs   its a male|`|Pv8cj7cjaa	look
5kFocucvaa	It is easier to identify snakes by head shape and scale pattern than color and size.  It sounds funny, but the families are distinguished by the head shape.<br>  <br>  If it was rectangular, with three large scales on the top of the head it would be a king snake.  They have checkered-like bellies.<br>  <br>  The description sounds like it could be a garter, they are popular all over. <br>  <br>  From the size, I wouldn't worry about it.  The best "hunters" can only lunge 1/2 of their length, so this snake would have to be no more than 9 inches away (probably closer) in order to bite.  If your cat was playing with it, it's most likely not poisonous (most cats are smarter than that).  <br>  <br>  I know there are several species of smaller boas  which could fit that description.  If you remember the shape of the head, compare that to pictures instead of coloring or size to get an idea of what type of snake that is.  <br>  <br>  Good luck, and if all else fails you can try your local Wildlife Dept, they would know what snakes should be around.|`|DVd3HTApaa	Call your local wildlife center or refuge. They would know about any of the snakes in your area. But, don't be fooled by the size of it . I caught a pigmy rattler once and at first I thought it was a gardner, turns out they are very poisonous and they're very small. Thank, God, I did not get bitten!<br>   That was close.|`|nawVCebbaa	It's either a Texas rat snake or a baby Black rat snake.  While they are not venomous, always keep in mind that they can still bite.  But I have 6 rat snakes, and have been bitten dozens of times.  It only hurts for not even a minute.  Then the bleeding stops and I disinfect it and that's it. <br>  Either that or it very POSSIBLY may have been a Copperhead, and they are mildly venomous.  But if it was near your home, more than likely, it was hunting for food.  They tend to stay away from humans.  My suggestion would be to talk to you child about snakes.  Explain to him/her that if you don't bother them, they won't bother you...and so on.<br>   Here are a few pics...are any of these like the snake you saw? <br>  <br>  BTW:  If you kept the snake...just let it go.

iVQULHqYaa	I had this problem. One of my dogs was twelve months old before she peed anywhere other than in my garden.

Walk with her until she pees and then praise her profusely. Enjoy your days out.|`|Eg1G2mvVaa	Does she walk with other dogs at all?  She should learn from them.

(make sure that there are no children around they don't understand that you know what you are doing and they may start to mimic you and can give the dog mixed ideas)  <br>  <br>  I know that this may seem off but don't show fear. When the dog goes and tries to nip at you and you back off you are telling it that it just won and that it is in charge. Get an empty coffee can and put rocks or coins in it. And everytime that the animals gets aggressive  shake the can.

I believe the best way is to not go for the Alpha status but to focus on showing her affection and lots of love. I live with or inside the pack and all dogs are equal, as are the cats. We have no alpha status in my home. I have my eyes on all the animals and ensure their needs are met in whatever way that takes place. There are times when a dog feels insecure and at other times one is more clingy, this invariably has to do with their level of well being. <br>  <br>  You feed the dogs, therefore, it is natural that they look to you for guidance, but at other times they will put you in your place. If you can handle that, you will experience wonderful loving moments, but if you feel that you want to follow the traditional way, you had better get that whip out! LOL<br>  <br>  In my opinion, if one dog pushes another out of the way, they need the attention more at that time and I have no problem giving that to them. Snarling is not allowed and I will correct the behaviour. However, I will cuddle the other dog at the same time as the one that snarls. I never allow any behaviour to take over, thus I am always in control. One of my females, she snaps, because she protects the shopping bags. That is her job. She will have a go at the others. One of the boys feels a little insecure and he may show his teeth, so he gets an extra pat on the head with a firm reminder that he is loved as much as the rest. <br>  <br>  You know your dogs and if you feel that you need to raise your finger as a sign of 'behave', you know. Call it mother's instinct. If kids argue, you step in and encourage harmony by instigating constructive mind control or activities. No different with animals. <br>  <br>  If you have adopted a dog from a shelter, this may require some different skills. Petty jealousies exist within the pack, it is how you handle them that will put a stop to this. I had 6 dogs jump on me, allowing myself to be used as the human trampoline. They all wanted my attention and I laughed, just like you did, positive reinforcement. All dogs received a warm hug and a healthy embrace and no one was left out. No fighting ever in my pack, other than play fighting with the cat.<br>  <br>  Might I add that healthy diet is a key factor in positive behaviour, including regular exercise.|`|bl8co4hUaa	A professional dog trainer would give you the best answer, but a couple things have worked well for me in controlling my mother's very hyper golden retriever male.<br>  <br>  1. I speak to him in a firm, normal- or low-ranged voice. No high octave, no baby talk, no uncertainty. I repeat as necessary, do not yield.<br>  <br>  2. I place my hand firmly on the front of his throat, gripping but not squeezing. This is to simulate an alpha dog or wolf's grabbing another by the throat in domination.<br>  <br>  3. I praise him when he does well, but do not fuss and coo over him. Maintain control.<br>  <br>  4. I stand over him, directly over his back. (Not straddling or sitting, standing only with his back between my feet.) An aggressive dog may react negatively.  (Golden retrievers aren't known for aggression, so it's safe for me to do this.)<br>  <br>  5. I stand in front of him looking *down* into his eyes. Firm, not aggressive. Again, see above re aggressive breeds.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|AA10229248	NILF - Nothing In Life Is Free.

Rub her all over the DIRECTION HER FUR GROWS. As long as she is down U love on her. If she pops back up U get her back down.

Google him.|`|MRE4T3I0aa	I could go into a long explanation but instead i am just going to say a few things and recommend you watch the dog whisperer . He helps me alot!<br>  ( cesar milan ) Anyways don't let your dog lead or be the first one in or out of the house . Hold the leash tight , ( dont  choke him though ) so he is by your side or slightly behind you . If he seems to get it , let go a little bit . If he starts to lead or gets distracted  and pulls you in another direction , pull him back ( gently ) and say ch! .  If he is good , allow him to walk off and explore a few times ( on the leash ) Other wise , I highly recommend watching cesar millan  ( the dog whipserer ) , I think that is how you spell his name , He gives great tips on showing the dog that your pack leader and having a well behaved dog , and having a great relationship with your dog .
XUEaEbTjaa	A small animal pet shop does tend to care for their animals better than other larger stores but this varies considerably from store to store. Some larger stores will take any animal to the vet if it shows ANY signs of sickness (I do know PetSmart does this) while others won't. Some small pet stores do this as well while others simply let the animal pass away.  Ask your pet store what happens to their animals if for example a hamster gets wet tail or a rat gets an upper respiratory infection while in their care.  Also ask what their policy is on returning animals. You want at least a two week guarantee on them.<br>  <br>  Some smaller pet stores breed their own animals. This can either be a good thing or a bad thing depending on the quality of animal and how often they breed from the animal they have chosen as a breeder.  Larger stores tend to get their animals from large breeders that don't really breed for health or temperament.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is a local shelter. Try petfinder.com for a list of animals in your area already in need of homes.  If there are no shelters nearby with gerbils, the pet store should be your last option if you cannot find a breeder in the area. Also try Craigslist.org for your area to see if anyone is looking for a home for their gerbils. Often times these individuals want to see their gerbil go to a good home so they include a cage.<br>  <br>  Gerbils can absolutely NOT live in a hamster cage regardless of what others may tell you.  You can always try it and pray your gerbil is not a chewer, but 85% of the time they can and will chew through any plastic on the cage.  The nice tubes and slides that come with the cages usually are chewed through by the week's end. Many pet parents come into my store and are upset that they purchased a hamster cage from another pet store because that's what the employee told them was fine and then they found out the hard way that the gerbil got right through it. Critter Trails are the worst option for gerbils.<br>  <br>  There are some options for you rather than a hamster cage.  Martins has a nice line of chew proof cages online.  You can also get a twenty gallon long (no smaller) aquarium for your gerbils. This needs to be cleaned at least once a week to keep the ammonia down as tanks have poor ventilation.  This is the only animal I'd ever say a tank is proper housing for.  They also sell wire tank toppers that provide better ventilation for a tank and more room. The only problem with these are that the ramps and levels are more often than not plastic and those get chewed quickly. The wire ramps and levels need to be covered if they are wire holed ramps and levels or little feet can get caught and could possibly end up with bumble foot.  <br>  <br>  Please let me know if you need any further information and I'd be happy to help you.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  =)<br>  <br>  ~Yelliez|`|nxKmMuFQaa	yes they can live in hamster cages. <br>  it'd probably be better to get your gerbils from a smaller pet shop as they're more likely to be handled. <br>  in large pet shops like ' pets at home ' the animals dont tend to be handled until somebody buys them .|`|b1207e2639795fc4f9452faeac4f8ef5aa	id start with buying them from a cage then work up|`|GHpcc5iKaa	usually smaller pet stores are better maintained because theres less to handle and take care of so the animals get more specific love and care instead of just what they need. So the animals would most likely be healthier and happier there so get some at the smaller one! :) And yes gerbils can live in hamster cages|`|Ws2QPD0Iaa	Honestly, don't buy from any petstore.  Petstore gerbils, as well as other rodents, are often inbred, and more susceptable to diseases and genetic conditions.  It is much more beneficial to just go to a breeder in your area, or adopt from a shelter.<br>  <br>  Also, petstore gerbils are not handled regularly so they would be less friendly.  Breeder is the way to go.|`|BWez86Ldaa	Personally, I adopt. There are tons and tons of homeless small animals out there, especially gerbils. Another thing to keep in mind is that gerbils are social creatures, they need a cage mate. I probably wouldn't put even a hamster in one of those trail cage things. They are extremely difficult to clean and store up a lot of ammonia to cause respiratory problems. Martin's has a GREAT line of hamster/rat cages and the Critter Nation is also a wonderful cage for small "critters". <br>  <br>  Most pet store animals come from terrible conditions and generally come from the same places. Pet store animals are kept in warehouses, sometimes in crappy wooden boxes, and are bred in these same conditions! It's terrible! Try looking on Craigslist or www.GooseMoose.com for a pair of adoptable gerbils.|`|cb5fKlRCaa	i dose not really matter but if your going to adopt make sure its a decant age as gerbils and hamsters don't live to long,if they are from smaller pet shop its more likely people have gave them in because they are the babies of their gerbil ! hope this helps meg x|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It shouldn't matter what pet store you get them from they should be treated the same whether it is a large or small store.

I don't see anything on the list that indicates that a Jack Russell Terrier/Chihuahua mix wouldn't be allowed.  The apartment complex is just trying to minimize potential problems from allowing residents to keep dogs. <br>  <br>  You've got some points in your favor already:  your dog is small, not large; your dog only barked at the boy who threw a rock at her--she didn't attack him; you care about your dog.  <br>  <br>  If your dog is well-behaved, you could take her to meet with the prospective apartment complex management.  Take along her papers from the pound that show her breed.  Show them that she's a good, friendly dog and would make a good neighbor.  <br>  <br>  If you dog has behavior problems (acts aggressive towards strangers, bark incessantly, is destructive, bites or nips), it'd be a good idea to take steps to correct the problem.  Check with your vet or the pound for resources, read books on dog training from you public library. The point is that if your dog has any of these antisocial behaviors, you could have a problem wherever you go.<br>  <br>  Some Jack Russell Terriers and Chihuahuas are extremely high energy critters.  If your dog is one of these, you might consider trying a duplex with a yard instead--more room to run around outside and burn off some of energy, less densely populated area for your dog to guard against, etc.  A yard also gives the dog a place to sleep in the sun or shade--an activity all of my dogs have loved!<br>  <br>  In the end, the dog owner is responsible for the dog's behavior.  You can minimize problems if your dog is well-socialized and well-behaved.  <br>  <br>  P.S.  If the boy had thrown a rock at me, I'd have barked, too!|`|FG5NbqO0aa	The restrictions are ridiculous first off, it's how the dog is raised, not the breed its self.

AA10973353	I completely agree.  I have a 12 year old beagle, for 8-9 years, I knew no better, till I started nosing around.  He ate Alpo for all those years.  His health wasn't good anyway, he has allergies, he's epileptic, and his coat was awful.  I blamed if on pour breeding for a long time.  After I found out how horrible Alpo was, I switched him to Canidae for seniors and overweight (as he's nearly 10 pounds over weight due to my ignorance)!  anyway, he now will run around the yard like he thinks he's a pup, his coat is beautiful, he has almost no seizures anymore, and his allergies are minimal.  Thank you to all who ranted about poor dog food!  Cuz now I have 4 of the healthiest dogs around!|`|Muz6YB18aa	All kinds of nasties can be included in the "meat by-product" category.Yep, pet food can contain tumors, and euthanized pets- making dogs and cats cannibals without knowing it. And antibiotics, tranquilizers, medicines, etc.<br>  <br>  I look for human grade foods. I have tried many brands with my chihuahuas. My dogs do best on Canidae Senior. They have been on it for several years. The kibble is smaller, so smaller breeds can chew it properly. It has glucosamine chondroitin for their joints. It is great for their coats, and normal stools. They had different issues on different foods, so be sure to find what works best for your dog. I buy Canidae at my local health food store for about $8 for a five pound bag- lasts a while with little chihuahuas. I have also purchased it at my local feed store, where they have larger bags too, at bulk prices if you have enough room to store it.<br>  <br>  P.S.

In short, he enjoys barking--it's a way to occupy himself when he's left alone.<br>  <br>  Fear barking, on the other hand, is a stress response. It's caused by something unknown to the dog, such as a sudden noise or another dog's bark. Fear barking can also result from sights and sounds a dog finds disconcerting, like skateboards or sirens. In these cases, dogs bark to send a clear message to whatever's scaring them: Stay away!<br>  <br>  A third type is frustration barking. This occurs when the dog is denied access to something he desperately wants, such as a favorite toy, a piece of steak, or the terrier on the other side of the fence.<br>  <br>  Here's a link that can help you treat this problem. hope this helps!<br>  <a href="http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/rxa.html" rel="nofollow">http://lnk.nu/dogtime.com/rxa.html</a>|`|64hKLGjpaa	Barking is sign of her missing you so get her some treats or toys before you leave if this dos not  work maybe if you can get her a playmate to keep the poor things life joyful

AA11901352	Here is a list that is good to feed your goldies.  Remember goldfish do not have stomachs like other fish and need to be fed 2-3 times per day not just once.<br>  <br>  Goldfish need a balanced diet.  When choosing a fish food choose one with high protein (48% or better) and low fat (5% or less)<br>  <br>  You can supplement their diet with things like Lettuce, mustard greens, turnip greens, collard greens, spinach, peas, Watersprite, seaweed, cukes, kale, chard, broccoli, lima beans, green beans, etc. and feed aquatic plants (e.g. duckweed, azolla, salvenia, etc) or hair algae daily.<br>  <br>  For their Carotenoids which are a family of pigments the fish can't make themselves and are obtained as part of the diet. These pigments result in red, yellow and orange colors. Fish have cells called chromataphores. Those cells convert lutein and carotenes into astaxanthin which is the red pigment. <br>  sources include, brine shrimp, krill, spirulina, marigold flowers, paprika, sweet red peppers, yams, carrots, pumpkin <br>  <br>  Watermellons and oranges are also good as well as proteins like chicken (chicken livers) beef (livers and parts) and pork  as well as worms and bugs.|`|MKuDawP7aa	Fish are probably one of the easiest and low maintenance of house pets. Although they take a bit of care, everything required to maintain a healthy aquarium can be done in a minimal amount of time. There are certain things you need to do daily, weekly and bi- weekly to make sure your fish stay happy and healthy.<br>  <br>  Of course you will feed your fish every day, but there are a couple other things you can do on a daily basis to make sure your fish are doing well. First of all, never over feed them. Give them only what they will eat in 2-5 minutes. You can determine if they are eating all of their food by watching them. Also observe their behavior and appearance to make sure they are not stressed, because stress makes them sick. It's a good idea to quickly check the equipment each day to make sure any filters, heaters and lights are working properly.<br>  <br>  The filter is probably the most important piece of equipment in your aquarium, because it keeps the water clean and free of dangerous toxins that can be harmful to your fish. Filters also provide aeration, which adds oxygen to the water. If your filter is not clean, it will become clogged and perform it's responsibilities badly. This is not good for your fish, so it is recommended that you clean the filter every two or three weeks. You can tell when the filter needs to be cleaned because it looks dirty and will start to smell. A dirty filter may also cause the water to become cloudy, which is another sign that it's cleaning time.<br>  <br>  Water maintenance is also important is you want your fish to live long and healthy lives. You should replace about one-third of the tank's water every week or two, to ensure optimal living conditions for your fish. If you fill the tank with tap water, make sure you treat it with a dechlorinator or other water treatment substance before adding it to the tank. Your pet store can make recommendations for how best to treat your home's tap water. Also check the temperature of the new water and keep it close to the original water so as not to shock the fish.<br>  <br>  A clean aquarium makes for healthy fish. Whenever you see algae along the tank walls, scrub them gently to remove the growth, taking care not to disturb the fish too much. Periodically clean the debris from the bottom of the tank either by water removal or with a siphon that vacuums the bottom of the tank. Be sure to clean any decorations and maintain any plants that are in the tank as well. Use a squeegee to keep the outside of the tank sparkling, and make sure the lights are also kept clean and in proper working order.<br>  <br>  Following these few steps on a regular basis will guarantee a healthy aquarium living environment, and you will have happy fish.|`|9d2cc6a06849ed43a202ad7ecc292799aa	You don't say if they are in a tank or a pond! But if they are in a tank they will be fairly active if they are in a warm room, their skin will be bright and shinny with no discolouration (eg white spot). But if they are in a pond all of the above except they won't be too active this cold weather to conserve energy. Have they plenty of green tank or pond plants to eat? As for treats try Daphna they love it all fish do and can be bought at pet shops.|`|laVGEEeraa	Fish don't have emotions on the same scale as humans.  They are not capable of being "happy" per se, but rather "content."  The way to tell whether they are content: where do they swim in the bowl or tank?  If they are near the middle or top, they are content.  If they are near the bottom they are less so.  If you have a tank with sea castles or other furniture and they spend a lot of time in them they are so not-content you could call them depressed.<br>  <br>  Any fish food is acceptable, but don't over feed them or they will die.  Fish don't know when to stop eating.|`|yZAcwN3haa	They will float and wont be as active as they once where.<br>  Try to switch the diet up a bit: crisps,flakes,shrimp,and tubflex  your goldfish will appreciate you in the end.|`|j3DqJ2BBaa	my fish loves bloodworms<br>  <br>  <br>  yuu cant really tell not really its hard to <br>  <br>  and if it floats its not unhappy ITS DEAD!!!<br>  <br>  and i have heard they like peas to !!!x|`|d8f443bc582285db859040a0c5e47adcaa	yes you can tell if fish are stressed[unhappy]they will stay in one place or hide,get fungus or whitespot etc.you can help prevent this by water changes and as you asked the correct feed.they like bloodworm but it is not too nourishing as it is about 80% water.a good flake food has additives to help keep it in good health whilst wheatgerm food is a good filler.you obviously care about your fish and want to treat them right.try some goldfish sites via google .<br>   hope this helps|`|963bb9573784f589ed62e694f054c9f7aa	When they stop wagging their tails or if you feed them too much.

SOxdyWQOaa	you can remove the cartridge itself until the ick is gone<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  17 years experience with fish|`|bDPVRtCNaa	You will have wasted money on treatment. Leaving the carbon in means filtering the medication out.<br>  <br>  If you can feel the carbon inside the cartridge, but can't open it, just cut the top off and pour out the carbon.<br>  <br>  ~The fish are under enough stress, dirty water will only add to it. Don't remove the cartridge completely.|`|AA11901352	The carbon is usually in a blue filter pad, or sometimes just in a baggie.  Simply pull the blue pad out of the filter while treating the tank.  Keep the filter running just remove the media from the filter.<br>  <br>  Ich is a parasite and is always in the water.  It is treatable follow the directions on the specific product you purchased.  DO NOT raise the temperature or add salt unless the directions say to do so.  This will just add more stress to your fish.<br>  <br>  Ich is usually cured in 7 days, however a serious case may take longer so continue to treat until there are no more symptoms.<br>  <br>  Remember to keep ich from attacking your fish, keep their stress levels low.  Weekly water changes and cleaning of 25%  is a must.  Don't bang on the tank and feed the proper diet.  These will keep ich at bay.|`|zqVDJxUIaa	This is a common parasite which most aquarists eventually encounter. Even if you follow quarantine procedures you may at some point acquire an infected fish, which should be treated before being introduced into your main aquarium. The good news is that if handled correctly, this disease can be easily and permanently eliminated. YOU MUST REMOVE THE CARBON, or else the carbon will absorb the medication, rendering it useless. When applying treatment, raise the temperature as high as your fish can stand, one or two degrees every 2 hours, up to 80 F. At 80 F the parasite immediately dies. However, a combination of gravel vacuuming, medication, and temperatures most effectively cure fish ich/ick.<br>  <br>  <br>  Because the life cycle is temperature-dependent and the ich can only be killed in the tomite (free-swimming) stage, we will want to raise the tank temperature to 78-80°F over 48 hours to speed the cycle of tomite formation and release. Theoretically, if the cycle takes four days to complete at this temperature, then the treatment should be complete in 4 days. On the other hand, if the temperature is much colder, for example at 60°F, the treatment would need to last for several weeks or longer.<br>  <br>  Since we understand that we cannot kill ich while it is on the fish, we know that moving a fish to a quarantine tank to treat will not solve the problem in the main tank. The time to use a quarantine tank is before a new fish is introduced into a display tank. If a fish in a tank has ich, you must assume that the entire tank is now contaminated with ich and must be treated.<br>  <br>  Another way to get ich out of a tank is to remove all of the fish. Since we know that the tomites can only survive for 48 hours without attaching to a fish, if we remove all of the fish and then raise the temperature to 80°, the existing ich in the tank should be dead after 2 days. To be safe, wait 4 days before returning the fish to the tank. But remember, you will need to treat the tank that the fish are moved to, otherwise, fish entering that tank could become infected.<br>  <br>  Remember, we are treating the tank, not the fish, so all effective treatments are designed to kill the trophite form of the disease while it is in the tank. The mature ich organisms that cause the problems on the fish do not die from treatment, but fall off in a couple of days during their normal life cycle and then their offspring die from the treatment in the water.<br>  <br>  Some of the best treatments historically have been formalin or malachite green, or a combination of the two. Copper, methylene blue, and baths of potassium permanganate, quinine hydrochloride, and sodium chloride have also been used but do not appear to offer an advantage over the more readily available formalin and malachite green products.<br>  <br>  Remember, gravel vacuuming is also important to suck up any protozoans (ick) that are at the reproducing stage.<br>  Regular water changes will help, too.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	well once the tank is infected your in a pretty sticky situation, so what im saying is its hard to get rid of. First raise the water temp a bit and make sure your fish is getting at least 8 hours of sunlight a day. It would be best to get a new filter cartridge and some ick-out and do a 20% water change. Thats pretty much all you can do though and i cant guarantee your fishes survival unfortunately :( But remember to take out the fish for 24 hours when you add the ick-out|`|dJs2s9pfaa	Yes you absolutely must remove your carbon filter since the carbon removes all the heavy metals,meds and other stuff from the water. If you don't you will just be wasting money on your meds because of the carbon filter and worse yet your fish will die because untreated ich results in the gills becoming infected and your fish will not be able to breathe.<br>  <br>  Here is the BEST & QUICKEST way to rid yourself of Ich:<br>  <br>  1) Raise your temp 82-85 F ( raising your temp will speed up the ich parasites lifecycle as there are only 3 days that the ich can be defeated by meds, the active phase)<br>  <br>  2) 50% water change before administering your meds, this will rid you of most free swimming ich and it's eggs<br>  <br>  3) Add 1-2 tbsp of Aquarium Salt per 5 gallons of your tank water<br>  <br>  4) Ick-Away or Quick Cure are the best, follow the instructs EXACTLY on the back of the bottle and DO NOT stop just because the last spot falls off. Ich should be treated for about 10 days unless your label says to do it for longer.<br>  <br>  After you've treated for 10 days make sure you start doing 25% weekly changes as this will keep your water clean. Furthermore, if you add any more new fish quarantine them in a separate tank or a bucket that has never had chemicals in it. I use Lifeguard by Jungle Labs on all my new fish as a preventitive measure. <br>  <br>  Do everything I just told you and you will be less likely to ever encounter a problem again. My tank has been disease free for about 4 years now.

laVGEEeraa	Cats spend most of their time sleeping and grooming themselves.  Just because you happen to be talking to him when he decides to lick himself has no bearing on how fast or slow he's doing it.  On the other hand he is content enough to groom himself when you are near.  Cats don't take baths that clean themselves all at once, instead they clean portions at a time.  Part of what occurs when they are grooming themselves is they are removing excess hair that does not shed off.  If they can pass the hair, great... because otherwise they will vomit it up<br>  <br>  Another part that occurs when they are grooming is they are spreading their saliva on their body.  They then mark their territory by rubbing up against you, spreading their dander.  <br>  <br>  Why does he yawn?  Cats' hearts beat at an accelerated rate, they use up their energy faster then we humans do and need to recharge more often.  He yawns because he's tired, again it has little to do with your baby talk.  You only notice these things when you are paying attention to him.  You would be able to see it more often if you littered your house with cameras and took videos of your cat when no one is around.|`|inST4SlAaa	i think the cat is enjoying his bond with you and loves you very much|`|V8rV38yfaa	Cats lick themselves as a form of grooming. Mainly it is a way to clean themselves off. However, there have been a number of advantages that people have suggested it provides which might be a reason they do this.<br>  People think it is used as a way to control their temperature - it keeps their fur smooth, which in the winter traps heat. In the summer, it spreads saliva on the fur and cools them down and can also loosen fur so that they shed more easily. Others think it is a natural way of reducing parasites like fleas or ticks.|`|YCvgjLdnaa	It's probably just coincidence, cats spend most their time licking themselves as they are really clean pets and don't like to have dirty fur. and since they spend their time sleeping, yawning is just what they do, like us, when we wake up. so when you talk to him, you are probably waking him up, he either yawns, or busies him self by cleaning.|`|YAPYO7L8aa	Sometimes they do this when they are nervous. Other times I think it is for pride. Have you ever been embarrassed and straightened out your clothes to try to save some pride. Well some of my cats have done some pretty funny things and when I laugh at them they start grooming. Most of the time the grooming is needed or a habit.

Then supplement with the puppy formula.<br>  <br>  I also agree with the posters who said the one puppy should see the vet to make sure there is no obstruction (although, again, I think it is because you switched them immediately from one food to another with no transition) and also contact animal control about the woman giving away puppies that are too young.  They need to confiscate that mother dog and fine the owner.|`|AA12377116	Dogs that young are not capable of digesting food yet.

You will have to force the dog to take this fluid but it is better in the end to make it then for it to die. <br>  <br>  Also since the puppies are so young they probably have not gotten their shots yet.

He spent his first 40 years of life despising cats and tormenting them. Then he was charmed by a stray named Biscuit and he turned into the 'cat man' overnight. He spent his last 14 years on this earth lying on the floor snuggling with cats, rising early in the morning to feed them - he would serve each cat their own portion of canned food on a separate dish and stand guard to ensure that no one had their food stolen - and he would disengage himself from any activity to jump up and run to a door at the slightest pawing and mewing.

AA11707728	That's the issue with cat's and pregnancy:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmos...</a><br>  <br>  Pregnancy precautions<br>  Congenital toxoplasmosis is a special form in which an unborn child is infected via the placenta. A positive antibody titer indicates previous exposure and immunity and largely ensures the unborn baby's safety. A simple blood draw at the first pre-natal doctor visit can determine whether or not the woman has had previous exposure and therefore whether or not she is at risk. If a woman receives her first exposure to toxoplasmosis while pregnant, the baby is at particular risk. A woman with no previous exposure should avoid handling raw meat, exposure to cat feces, and gardening (cat feces are common in garden soil). Most cats are not actively shedding oocysts and so are not a danger, but the risk may be reduced further by having the litterbox emptied daily (oocysts require longer than a single day to become infective), and by having someone else empty the litterbox. However, while risks can be minimized, they cannot be eliminated. For pregnant women with negative antibody titer, indicating no previous exposure to T. gondii, as frequent as monthly serology testing is advisable as treatment during pregnancy for those women exposed to T. gondii for the first time decreases dramatically the risk of passing the parasite to the fetus.<br>  <br>  Despite these risks, pregnant women are not routinely screened for toxoplasmosis in most countries (France[9], Austria[9] and Italy[10] being the exceptions) for reasons of cost-effectiveness and the high number of false positives generated as the disease is so rare (an example of Bayesian statistics). As invasive prenatal testing incurs some risk to the fetus (18.5 pregnancy losses per toxoplasmosis case prevented[9]), postnatal or neonatal screening is preferred. The exceptions are cases where foetal abnormalities are noted, and thus screening can be targeted.[9]<br>  <br>  Some regional screening programmes operate in Germany, Switzerland and Belgium.[10]<br>  <br>  Treatment is very important for recently infected pregnant women, to prevent infection of the fetus. Since a baby's immune system does not develop fully for the first year of life, and the resilient cysts that form throughout the body are very difficult to eradicate with anti-protozoans, an infection can be very serious in the young.<br>  <br>  Transplacental transmission:(a) infection in 1st trimester - incidence of transplacental infection is low (15%) but disease in neonate is most severe. (b) infection in 3rd trimester - incidence of transplacental infection is high (65%) but infant is usually asymptomatic at birth.[|`|h6NqNzHAaa	No, cats can't make you sterile but a pregnant woman should not change the litter box due to bacteria.<br>  Cat breath is harmless to you.|`|hGY08GjRaa	No.. and no<br>  <br>  My sister-in-law has been a cat owner both before, during, and after she conceived both of her extremely healthy children. <br>  <br>  I'm 28, and have lived in the same house as cats for 28 years...

Once everyone has presented to the judge you will then be called in for final placings. Once you have received your rossie (and everyone else) you will be asked to do 1 lap of honour which is done in trot and then you will exit the ring.<br>  <br>  Your horse will need to be shown in a bridle that compliments his head along with a suitable bit. Make sure though that bit does not drown his head as I have seen this way to often! Depending on what class you enter, you may show 'in natural state' (ie; not plaited, as in mountain and moorland classes), or plaited and polished. Check the rules for the show you wish to enter.<br>  <br>  Your attire -  I would wear navy, or light coloured. trousers as jodphurs are for under 14s or 16's.

A good clean, well clipped, well fitted horse will place well only if the person showing does so properly.<br>  <br>  Most classes begin by having the contestants line up. A pattern is either demonstrated or posted before the class, and contestants must exhibit their horse through the small pattern. Sometimes all the judge asks of you is to trot the horse away from them and then back again.<br>  <br>  -you always want to keep your body from obstructing the view of the judge. As a rule of thumb be on the opposite side of the judge.<br>  <br>  -maintain eye contact with the judge at all times.<br>  <br>  -when you are waiting in the line up make sure the horse is standing square.<br>  <br>  -when the judge does their inspections, do not obstruct their view of the horse.

nwMBfgcdaa	It is estimated dogs can smell up to 1000 times better than humans. One example frequently given is the ability to detect one gram of butric acid (a component of sweat).  It is due to the fact dogs noses are especially tuned to animal related odors since they are hunters.  If it were to be dissolved in a ten story building evenly, humans would barely be able to detect it. If the same gram was dissolved over 135 sq mile area (about the same size as the city of Philadelphia, up to a height of 300 meters, a dog could still detect it. <br>  <br>  Dogs have these amazing sense because of a few things.  One, the average olfactory bulb (smell decoding sensors) in a dog is approx. 60 grams, where as humans is about 15 grams.  Because of this, a larger part of the dogs brain is dedicated to scent.  Dogs noses are also set up different to help smell better.  The wet "leather" of a dogs nose acts to attract scent molecules and they can wiggle their nostrils independantly to help determine direction of scent.  They  have an area where scent can be trapped to prevent it from being lost when the dog exhales so the scent can accumulate.  <br>  Not only can dogs smell water, they can smell through water.  There are cadavar dogs trained to search water by boat to locate human remains below the surface.  They are able to search above the thermacline (there is a line usually around 30ft below the water where the temperature of the water drops drastically), and they are still sometimes successful below the thermacline by using an anchor to break the line.  <br>  Part of our scent that dogs track is made up of what we have eaten.   What food we eat, how often we eat it and the are and manner in which it is metabolized is individually different and is able to be detected by dogs.|`|1H0vYaJxaa	Yes they do it has been proven in both labs and from years of breeding.<br>  <br>  Yes dogs smell the condensation from the water.<br>  <br>  Dogs can smell what you have eaten especially if it is garlic since it gets absorbed and goes throughout your system and the scent stays in your mouth.|`|3a1d98e5d06e33a288cfd5d40b0c4470aa	Yep, they sure can. Just as you can smell them when they are unwell. Their body odour changes and the coat becomes oily. The difference with humans and animals is that we have lost our keen sense of smell, whereas in nature the senses have not changed at all.<br>  <br>  Humans can regain the same abilities, but it requires training. I can smell the difference between a dog wee and that of a female or a cat, including humans. <br>  <br>  Water is easy for most animals, because their nose is highly tuned to pick up all kinds of energies. If you floss your teeth regularly, you can have a similar experience when food remains start to break down.|`|aXsq6N2Yaa	Defiantly, dogs have an acute sense of smell, mainly depending on the breed, the bull dog can't smell nearly as well as a beagle.

PHOyKsmPaa	He has to be crate trained. He must stay in the crate at night and when you are not with him. Because a crate is like a "DEN" that he would live in the wild, he will not pee or poo in his sleeping area. (that is why putting him in an open room is NOT a good idea, It is not small enough to be considered his bedroom only.  When he is let out of the crate take him directly outside and praise him for going potty. Crate training is the best way to train a dog all around. The military and the police departments use crates too.<br>  <br>  Using pee pads is a horrible idea, it trains them to go to the bathroom in the house! Never allow him in your bed, it sends a signal that he is on your level and you are not the pack leader. Take it from people that have experience training Shepherds... Crate training is the way to go.|`|SpcYCBndaa	put it in bed with you|`|NAGiNKFWaa	I would put his crate by my bed at this age, with a night light on so he could see me and be reassured.  Any 8-week-old puppy needs reassurance.  I might also have a cd or radio playing.  Here are some tips, use what helps.  I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|OxFsslN8aa	I agree with liligirl.  My puppies have always slept in a dog bed next to my bed.  I block off an area big enough for the bed and a pee pad or newspaper (anything to protect the carpet).  When they cry I hang my arm over the side of the bed & after reassuring them that I am near they go to sleep.  I don't use crates - never have - and all 4 of my dogs have been potty trained outside and slept through the night by 12 weeks.|`|AA12377116	Puppies are used to being with their littermates and are lonely and scared in the dark alone at night. Put his bed in your room.<br>  <br>  Put wee wee pads down in the house while you are training him.<br>  <br>  The pads have a chemical in them that attracts dogs. <br>  <br>  I dislike crate training methods, for many reasons, but many heartily encourage this practice.<br>  <br>  You need training classes and so does your dog.

She will taste the bitter apple and associated the taste with chewing on your stuffed animals.|`|Chxoncy7aa	Get a net to hang from the ceiling, and put all stuff animals out of reach.

And yes a muscular dog will hide.|`|vouUQQzBaa	Well, she's a first time mom for once, so you cannot compare her with previous litters by others, plus no pregnancy is ALWAYS the same.<br>  <br>  Since you DEF. know the mating time (based on your count), do not worry if she's active and is acting normal. Can you actually feel the puppies? Can you count them? Does she seem to have many pups? <br>  <br>  I would just keep an eye on her. I would not stress it at this time however. She seems like she's doing fine :)|`|qapJU3tMaa	Oh boy, welcome to the world of backyard breeders.  If you have to be asking questions on Yahoo Answers, you have NO business breeding dogs.  Dogs are NOT in whelp, they are pregnant.  Why don't you ask your breed mentor your questions?  What did the ultrasound show?  <br>  <br>  Hopefully your dog has her breed championship and has all of her health and genetic testing done?<br>  Is she even registered?<br>  <br>  Please spay your dog after this litter.

oo2Hqqanaa	I treat both of my dogs (rare ailments) with homoeopathic or herbal medicines. You could try Dandelion leaf capsules, (Dandelion being a natural diuretic) you can get them at Holland & Barrett or some such similar outlet. They will certainly do no harm to the dog and may prove useful.<br>  <br>  Just remember that like all herbal medicines, there is rarely any immediate effect or relief and the herb must often be used for an extended period.|`|iIGOi2Idaa	In what way 'not working'? Frusemide is not a cure-all, it will simply draw excess fluid from your dog. By the time a dog is in need of a diuretic he's usually pretty ill, so there could be any number of issues going on here. <br>  <br>  I haven't heard of another diuretic, other than frusemide (generic name of Lasix). Either way, we can't prescribe it!<br>  <br>  Chalice
9Xt3UpB1aa	I have a Beagle/German Shepherd cross. She is quite strong and I was afraid she was going to rip through her old collar. So I got her a strong leather one, hers does not have spikes on it, but it does have small studs. There is no possible way she could ever break through it, and it looks really good, in my opinion. People are going to judge your dog not matter what you do because you have a pit bull, which is really sad. But you can get a tan leather collar instead of black, that would look "less threatening".<br>  <br>  I got my dog's collar from hotdogcollars.com. They have a great selection, customizable, and a GREAT price that can't be beat. I definitely recommend them if that is what you end up going with.|`|4444d48004267fc3c148eb176ef253d8aa	They absolutely will judge her and you negatively seeing that.  Pit Bulls get a bad enough reputation without you adding to it.  Your dog looks tough enough without hardware.  Plus it makes you look insecure in your manhood IMO.<br>  Get a normal one and work on showing her friendly side so ppl will see what great dogs they can be.|`|qapJU3tMaa	Why don't you just get a plain leather buckle collar.  I hate those stupid spiked collars/harness.  If you are worried about judging you and your dog, why would you want to get one of those ugly things?  Most people who use them just want their dogs to look like bullies.|`|AA10029366	Frankly, I look at those things on Pit Bulls and my first thought is, "What part on that man is so tiny that he has to compensate for it by making his dog look like a badass?"<br>  <br>  ...but that's just what I think.<br>  <br>  Is there a reason that putting her on a leash and collar won't work? You can train her to walk nicely. Putting a dog in a harness is essentially giving it permission to drag you around, since all you're doing is making it easier for the dog to do so.|`|t2M1kXY4aa	You're right.  They will.<br>  <br>  Get her something pink and sparkly instead.|`|UiOAnm89aa	If I'm honest if I saw you walking down the street with your dog in a leather spiked chest plate I would cross the road - not because of her but because of the person walking her.<br>  I think most people would find that would make the dog look really agressive and the only reason a person would have to make a dog look agressive is if trouble followed them!<br>  <br>  I'm not saying for a minute that's what you're like but, rightly or wrongly, that would be the snap decision I would make.|`|S5Lz35myaa	People will judge a spiked harness as being needed due to a vicious dog.<br>  Personally, I would use a good chain slip collar when you walk her, and some obedience classes so she does not pull you along.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	I have an APBT Rotti mix and I would avoid you with a spiked leather harness.

If he is playing with it on his own I'd think about taking the string off: there might be potential for it to get wrapped round him, or for him to swallow it (and once a string starts going down, it can be difficult to stop and can't be pulled out, means operation...)<br>  <br>  Play balls that you can put treats in work really well: you can buy them, but I find they can be hard to find.|`|EmuKIOHWaa	I think your cat will love it but then get fed up with it when it finds out it cant get to the food|`|xarKlp0Oaa	It sounds like a good toy to me. Sure, why not?|`|wZ0OilW2aa	does it really matter?|`|J2mtxO2Paa	take a rubber band and tie a string to and then tie the string into a loop making a slingshot. Dangle it infront of her and when it becomes a fun thing to bat at, shoot it a short distance and hopefully she will go after it, even tually retrieving it for you to shoot again again...my cat loves this activity.
c90696a851f3ee0c6b1f63f7f595eca4aa	I didn't look at the picture because it was taking too long to load, but from your description, yes, I would be sort of upset. You should buy some clippers and learn to clip nails yourself, that way you're in control.|`|cnZlMojUaa	My dogs have difficult nails to trim. If they get too long, the vet can clip the quick and cause bleeding and pain. Some times the nails are brittle and will splinter. From your photo, they really don't look too bad. I always feel the vets office can deal better if a nail is cut too close or splits too much. Dogs with the black nails are just harder to cut. It also is hard if the dog wiggles or fights. Also the type of nail cutter can cause splintering of the nail.<br>  <br>  One of my dogs fights nail trims so much that I do take him on long walks on concrete so that the nails wear more and his trims are less frequent. If the jaggedness bothers you, you might be able to file or sand them down more smooth. I would be upset if a nail was missing if this wasn't explained, but from your photo, the nails look pretty normal.<br>  <br>  You can try to do the nails yourself, but if you do, make sure you have something called Quick Stop which will stop bleeding if you nick the quick. Groomers can also do nails.|`|0QTCiCf8aa	They look fine, if you don't like it do it yourself.|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	I see the missing nail, but before I got all bent out of shape, I would certainly ask them about the missing nail!

However, if they say they did it - yeah, I'd be pissed off!<br>  <br>  Keep an eye on that nail.

First off, it is your dog and your choice whether or not you are happy with the nail trimming service you received. However, there are also other factors involved that you may not have considered. Some dogs have very brittle nails that can split easily when trimmed. One of my dogs wiggles around so much in an attempt to avoid nail trimming which almost always results in at least one nail being cut to the quick causing bleeding. So, in short, if your dog does not have brittle nails and does not fight nail trimming, then your vet should have been able to do a better job! I would file them down for now and ask your vet to teach you how to properly and safely trim them yourself.|`|w9aR8ymGaa	usually assistants or techs clip the nails.  Tell the vet him/herself as they may not be aware.  I would be livid.<br>  <br>  Also, I never allow anyone to groom my dog in anyway without me being there to supervise.

AQsiugSpaa	Hi Savannah,<br>  <br>  Yes, cats do dream. Just like humans, they dream when they are in the REM ( rapid eye movement) stage of sleep, which is much deeper than the light napping stage. <br>  <br>  Of course we don't know what they dream about, and folks like to speculate that they are dreaming about hunting mice, birds and other small critters as cats are predatory animals. Since we cannot communicate easily with our kitties in words, we sure do get creative about our dream interpretation for them.<br>  <br>  For a fantastic read about cats and dreaming, which I think you will find fascinating - I know I did - vist: <br>  <a href="http://www.petpeoplesplace.com/resources/articles/cats/011-01.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.petpeoplesplace.com/resources...</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

Drnpe4T5aa	If he came from a shelter, he got used to having almost no room to move around in.  Often, they are not given beds - but a towel to curl up in.  I have seen many cats curled up in their litter boxes in shelters, as they have sides, and offer a more "cozy" sleeping area.<br>  I had a cat that did that for a while (medium length hair - so I completely know what you are talking about.)  I just sort of shrugged it off.  He stopped after a while.  And he didn't come from a shelter, but has always just liked small spaces.  To this day, if I leave a box out (even a tiny box for a pair of infant-sized shoes) he will curl up in there to sleep, even though he is literally spilling over the edges (He grew up to be a really long and tall guy)<br>  You could try offering other beds.  Go to Walmart and get a couple plastic storage bins, the ones that are about 6 inches high, and toss a blanket or towel in it.  You could even buy a new kitty litter pan and put a towel in there.  Don't use the existing one, as it has already got his pee-smell in it and it will confuse him as to where he should potty.<br>  Enjoy your new kitty.  ;)|`|25660b99958e6df83f2c651134b3891faa	the poor thing is scared to death. scared cats hide. even the low sides of the litter box provide him with a "fort" to hide in.<br>  <br>  give him a box. .close it, cut a hole just big enough to fit through, or put a blanket over an open top box. put in the back of a dark closet, under a bed or in the corner of the room. if you cant put it in a closet, you need to pile boxes around it, or put a blanket over it, like a tent.<br>  <br>  what you are making is a cave for him to hide in. even pillows piled around a corner like a kids fort will work, but the darker and smaller the better. which is why the box in the closet is best.<br>  <br>  he will live in the box and clam down. soon, he will explore the house. the box will stay his cave to run to when scared.|`|vgh629AZaa	My pet began doing this 2 days ago after she had a stroke. It is somewhat strange, but your cat seems healthy. Maybe within a few days after he gets more familiar with your family, and your home.. he will begin to move around your house. It would probably be best to move his bed somewhere else. That being said, cats sleep anywhere that they are comfy. He may just feel most comfortable there. I wish I could help you. :(|`|xd7tSmQeaa	Cats sleep wherever they can.  I have four cats and have found them sleeping in some strange places.<br>  <br>  Just enjoy the goofiness and make sure the litter is clean =]|`|TFQeNZeAaa	I work at the Humane Society in my county and most of the cats do it for a few reasons.  The cages are small and there is no where else to go or the cats are afraid and will hid in the litter box.  He is probably sleeping in there because that is a comfort place and it puts up a little bit of a wall, kind of like he is hiding and you can't see him.  This is more than likely normal because you just adopted him.  He will warm up to you on his time and when he is ready.  Also, kudos to you on adopting a cat that needed a home!  Hope this helps!|`|O0FvCWtPaa	Perhaps it gives some warmth|`|UxlL89rHaa	Get him a cat bed.|`|inST4SlAaa	add a pet cushion.  my cats have a round carpeted  tree like house and they like to sleep on the top.  if you do not have much money then get a small box and put a fluffy small blanket in there ar a fluffy towel.  you could find one at good will for cheap.  you might have to cut the blanket down to fit in the box
FG5NbqO0aa	Adopting from a Shelter is great, and the dogs are carefully screened. Shelters won't adopt out aggressive or sick dogs at all. The thing I would be concerned about however is having a 12 week old puppy and a small child at the same time. Puppies are like little kids. They require the same amount of attention, and housebreaking can be a tedious process. If you have two older dogs as well, they may not take kindly to the puppy. It may also be way to much for you to handle, if you have two older dogs, one puppy and one kid (which, because a puppy requires so much time, is like having two small children). There's also the cost to consider. Can you afford vet bills, vaccination costs ect on top of your older dogs needs as well as your kids? Puppies tend to be rough, and hyper too. They may nip and bite at little kids, not trying to be mean, but just being a puppy. If I were I'd wait a bit and let your kid grow up more, so that they require as much time and attention as a little baby or toddler does. Plus, older kids can be easier to teach about how to handle themselves around a dog, especially a young puppy. If you decide not to go through with it, don't worry. I volunteer at 2 shelters, and puppies usually go quick! If you do, just balance the pros and cons beforehand because it could the best decision of your life, or it could be one of the most stressful. Pets are meant to bring enjoyment- not stress. Remember that. <br>  <br>  Good Luck :)|`|Z8AhDCWEaa	if you get a new pet, I would suggest an adult dog for now.  Puppies are still developing their personalities, and it is important for you to already know what kind of dog you will be getting since your child is so young.  Mature dogs are going to be more patient with a toddler than a young rambunctious dog will.  <br>  Huskies are VERY energetic, a thousand times more than a lab.  They were bred for long distance running, so you can imagine the depths of their stamina.  An adult will be playful, but he won't be doing a lot of the jumping and play-biting that most puppies do.  Young dogs can be very harmful to a toddler until they learn their manners. <br>  On the other side, huskies are very friendly and playful, and are very similiar to labs in temperament.  They seem to be more mentally "interactive" than the labs, as they will actively listen to you and will try to express themselves in a way that most dogs do not.|`|PHOyKsmPaa	I hate to say it, but I would never get a pet from a shelter.  Especially if I had young children. You never know what the puppy has been through or where it came from.  Since it is so young, you may not have to worry about aggression as much, but it may have never been properly socialized with people and children.|`|4C9W8Cu8aa	I have 2 friends/family with huskys. They are somewhat agressive but are very loving and intellegent. I think that you would need to see how the puppy reacts with your son and also the Lab. The huskys that I have known get along well with our little puppy. I don't know how much that helps but thats all I know.
39a2d5e9bc3c417cbdc5ba33cb6386bbaa	Bettas are picky eaters.  Try to keep freeze dried and or frozen blood worms and brine shrimp on hand also.  I doubt she will refuse those.  Bettas tend to not eat the first couple of days you bring them home anyway, she is probably just getting used to her new environment.  Just keep trying.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	What temperature is your water?<br>  <br>  Betta's are tropical fish and require an aquarium heater to maintain their temperatures between 77F-82F. Too low and they may be inactive, susceptible to disease, and refuse food.|`|wnnudNp5aa	Might be the stress of a new home, or the wrong food. Are you feeding her Betta pellets?  Try offering her bloodworms, brine shrimp, or little pieces of a shelled pea. One of those should tempt her to eat. Good luck!|`|VdLnVhlVaa	Dont feed her for a few days and see what happens.<br>  <br>  Also if i just changed the water i wait about a day to feed again.|`|0vbd3WQCaa	My fish does that aswell, i tried feeding them with smaller pieces of food and it worked, you could try breaking up the flakes :)|`|IYH49BKHaa	maybe it's the wrong food?
nMe35c9Aaa	good advice i'll have to remember that!!|`|IVTCflAOaa	ponies are thirsty, when they dont drink that is.  you can lose ten pounds by going to mexico and drinking the tap water, i didnt but everyone else did.. =).  suckin in farts through a straw is nasty. and before you punch a llama, you should know that they are aggresive.  it WILL spit on you, and probably bite and punch you back.

vS1Z0inOaa	That likely just means there is air in it. Some pumps have an aerator built in to add oxygen to the water. If your pump is older and there is a crack somewhere, in a tube perhaps, it could do the same thing. This will not bother your turtle at all. I actually like to put an airstone in my tanks because, although turtles do not breahe water, they can extract some oxygen by drinking it because their throats have extra blood vessels. So I find mine stay under water longer and seem more comfortable when the water is well oxygenated. Just to be sure though, have you opened up the filter and cleaned it out, and what kind of media are you using?|`|HU4Kmi5vaa	whats your question? :S|`|p8xUCZIVaa	You could turn the filter down slightly?<br>  <br>  For my turtle, I've put some rocks, branches (like.. a big log) and leaves/plants in there and he seems fine.

Crate training would really help you with not just training your dog to be housebroken but to develop other good canine behaviors. If you don't like the idea of a crate, you can actually gate/fence a certain part of your house for your fido, like the kitchen.<br>  <br>  This should help you do the trick.

Another condition that causes excessive urination and polydipsia (excessive drinking) is Cushings disease which is a result of a tumor on either the pituitary or adrenal glands.<br>  <br>  He could have a bladder infection. <br>  <br>  Best thing for you to do is schedule a vet appointment and take your dog in. Have them check and see if he has a bladder infection first. If they rule that out they can look for other things. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!!|`|SezOZE0haa	You need to take him to the vet. There are three possibilities that are serious:<br>  <br>  Diabetes<br>  <br>  Cushings disease <br>  <br>  Urinary tract infection<br>  <br>  All will show these symptoms of drinking alot and peeing requently.

MyjgtGotaa	It's completely territorial. That's not a bad thing though, it's apart of the roles in the animal kingdom. If your worried about the little one getting hurt, I wouldn't, but maybe try tapping the oldest one on the nose with your two fingers if her tries biting the other one. <br>  Also the reason cats go outside is pretty clear, that's there terrain. If you haven't had them fixed then maybe you should do that because they may decide to run away. Make sure they've had their shots or they could bring a disease into your home. And whatever you do, don't de-claw, that's their only defence against attacking animals. Plus it's good exercise for them to be running around chasing bugs and climbing trees.|`|xarKlp0Oaa	I have 2 male cats myself. Salem is the newer one and Oreo Ihave had for 1 1/2 years. It is a territorial thing that male cats do. I know it seems horrible but for cats it's not. The 1 year old is just telling the 7 month old that this was his house first. Mine have been doing this for about 4 months now and I have tried to stop it and I can't.
gBIrmaOXaa	I have always had females and never had a problem. But you need to think like a dog, you are pack leader and your whippet x will be 2nd there fore your new pup should be at the bottom. Things you should do to reiterate to the pup that it is NOT alpha (top of the pack) is always feed the top dog 1st, always let the top dog walk out of the door/gate 1st, fuss the top dog 1st. Or else bringing a larger breed in could end up with problems. It sounds complicated but once you get in a habit of doing it it becomes 2nd nature i have 4 now and they all no their place in their pack.|`|1Du4Rudvaa	It would probably be best to get a male-less chance of them getting into a fight.  There is no guarantee that any dog will get along with the other.  I have seen two females dogs get along with each other, but not that often.  It seems like they always have a little bit of aggression toward each other.|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	I think with two dogs, a spayed female, neutered male pairing tends to do best.  There is less chance of squabbles over pack order and my male/female pairings that I've owned have always been best buds.|`|mRevWUxlaa	What kind of breed is it? That makes a difference. I would say that another female would be fine. If you get a male, he may be territorial with her but a good way to solve that problem is to have him neutered as soon as the vet will do it. The vet I worked for would do neuters as early as 8 wks. But others wouldn't touch puppies until they were 4 months. Good Luck and hope I helped you!!!! =)|`|wvUNmmzOaa	Well normaly, females fight females, males fight males. And females do not fight males so if i were you i would get a male. They wil hopefuly get along and maybe in 2 or 3 years have puppies. That is possible cause i have a female dog younger on 4 years than my male.|`|uicbw4Eeaa	it depends on the dogs|`|03b3aed9d5156f2deeac75564e57e302aa	It definitely depends on the breed, and no matter what gender pup u get, that pup will have to learn to submit to the older dog.  If u have children for the first few weeks I wouldn't leave children around them unattended until u see the true disposition of the dog.  There's so much that can be said to this particular question; maybe u could try and ask ur vet.

pBcPWKXXaa	Is she spayed? That could be the issue, you should do it, regardless if she goes out side or not. You are doing the right thing by keeping her indoors but for health reasons you should spay her. One of my 3 cats was found at a young age and handraised. She turned out crazy like that at about 6 months. Needless to say she did calm down, but not for another 3 years and after I got a kitten. Or it could just be her being a kitten, which will pass. I don't know your full situation, but it sounds like it could be one of those things.  Good luck with your kitty.|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	Wow.<br>  If you have the extra money or she's due for shots anyway take her to the vet and see if something is wrong.  It could be something small you just don't see.<br>  On another note, cats can just be crazy.  We had one or two through the years that out of nowhere tried to kill us.  They learned that we would no longer pay any attention to them after they did this for a day or so and one actually turned around and became a nice cat.  It took a while though and I wonder if it was more maturity that changed her. The other is now a barn cat :0)<br>  She's young and if not spayed this could also be causing some problems.  Moodiness, crazies.  <br>  Good luck with her and I hope this is something that will pass in time.<br>  kath|`|A7XV2K3Paa	There is nothing wrong with her. This is normal - a cat's hunting instinct and a little extra kitten energy. My boy did the some thing for a while. Just keep telling her "NO!" firmly and removing your hand or set her on the floor. It will take a while but she'll get it.  The best thing I did for Simon was a cat tree and to hang a cat toy from the door way for him to attack. He quickly learned to take his energy out on his toys and by climbing.|`|2DPc5gyOaa	I have a 1 year old male and he does the same thing...as for just saying NO and removing them...I have been trying that for about 8 months now and it doesn't work!!

So far, the "attacks" have started coming less often, but he still get in the "mood" every once in awhile so watch out!! Good luck|`|40a1a9a018b700c159b91d322ba86796aa	Sounds like she may need some exercise. Get her some toys and actually play with her - chasing a feather or mouse or string, whatever.

Are you maintaining the SAME salinity? Changing it is a tricky process, even for expert keepers/breeders of diamondback terrapins. <br>  Reptile pets deserve more commitment and better care than such a vague question and such inexpert answers as you will get on this site. Internet-search by “[pet species] Caresheet” and/or go to kingsnake.com, where you will get genuinely expert advice. <br>     Animals are not toys. Pets have no right to humane treatment because they are not human. BUT we have an obligation not to be cruel or neglectful, because as human beings we know better and have a moral duty to act in accordance with that knowledge. That's why it's called "humane" treatment. If you're not humane, you're not fully human.|`|3o6qACycaa	In future please please avoid buying an animal you don't know anything about. <br>  <br>  What are you feeding mrs jingles?

Here are some tips, use what helps. I use a crate* to potty train with, but only for potty training and then I break it down and store it.  I put blankets and a small food and water dish in the crate.  Dogs don't potty where they eat and sleep.  When they are first little, I only expect them to hold their potty for 4 hours, and then 6 hours, then 8 hours and so on.  So when they are first little, I set a timer or alarm clock to wake myself up at night to take them *out.  I only allow my puppy in the bedroom* or the living room, only one room at a time.  They have to graduate to more space.  If I allow them to have full run of the house, it will overwhelm them.  I take them out the same door each time.  I tie a dinner bell to the door handle.  Do not use a jingle bell as they could get their toe caught in it.  So when they are little, I ring the bell for them, and then open the door to go *outside to potty.  When they get bigger, I take their paw and whack the bell and open the door to go potty.  Eventually getting to the place where the puppy will ring the bell and let me know when they need to go potty.  Dogs want to please you, so it is your job to let them know what behaviors please you and what doesn't.  So when my puppy goes potty, I give her a treat*, and clap, and make a fuss and praise her.  So she learns that going potty outside makes me happy.  If she has an accident, make a disgust sound like “tsst” and take her out right away.  I never yell* or spank* my puppies.  Take them out when they first wake up, after they eat or drink, before nap, finish romping, when their activities change, or when they are sniffing around. Some puppies go pee right away, but may not go poop until 10 minutes later, so wait for the poop.  I have a little play time here, because sometimes I think they are done, and they are not.  Puppies train at their own pace.  While I may have a puppy that hasn't had an accident in several weeks, I don't let my guard down.  I don't expect my puppies to be "fully potty trained" until one-year-old.  If they have a setback, shake it off, and start over.  I only have my puppies in the crate when I am not watching them.  When I am sleeping, cooking, ironing, doing chores, basically when I am not watching her.  All other times, she is out of the crate practicing being a "big girl."  This is the time I train her how to behave in the house.  So we are practicing "no barking", 'no biting", "no jumping", and "don't eat the furniture."  I also have to practice "playing inside" so she doesn't knock over things.  You must keep the puppy in sight when they are little because they don’t know the difference between newspaper and carpet, and you don’t want them sneaking off and getting into trouble.   Some puppies can sleep through the night around 3-months-old, but their bladder is grown around 6-months-old. <br>    <br>  REVISIONS:  <br>  *I use a CRATE to train with.  It is the method I prefer, compared to other methods I have tried.  I noticed that if they are in the crate, while I am doing chores, they are o.k., because the crate allows them to see me and be re-assured.  The crate can also be a comfort when stored in the basement for dogs who live in areas where thunderstorms and tornados are an issue. .  However, use the method that works best for you.....a laundry basket, a cardboard box, a woof-woof house, x-pen, child gates, whatever works for you. <br>  *OUTSIDE, pee pad, litter box, whichever method you are using.   When the puppy is first little, keep the pee pad, litter box near the food and water dish, so the puppy can eat and drink, and then go potty.  You can move it away as they get older.  The pee pad has a scent that smells and initiates potty.  Sometimes a pee pad makes a sound that scares some puppies, so you might want to use a litter box if that happens.  The pee pad allows a puppy to walk around, but a litter box keeps the puppy in one place. <br>  *BEDROOMS, I use the bedroom and living room for training, because it works for me.  Choose rooms that work for you, but watch for rooms that are damp, or drafty.  While my puppies sleep in the bedroom during training, once they are trained, I let them sleep where they want to.  They don't have to sleep in the bedroom forever. <br>  *TREATS.  While I use treats for training, you don't have to.  I like Charlee Bears for training (a little cracker for a little mouth,) I use them for training, but once they are trained, I cut back on them.  <br>  *SOME PUPPIES will go potty in the same spot each time.  Some puppies have to be told to go potty.  A command like "go out" for pee, or "go finish" for poop, might work for you, keep saying “go finish” until the puppy poops.  This is a good thing to train if you travel with your dogs.  By using commands, the puppy won't get confused when you are visiting someone, on vacation with you, or when you get to a new home.  The command will tell them what you want them to do in an unfamiliar place.  You might also want to use a leash method, so the puppy doesn’t sneak off, or for strange places. <br>  *YELLING.  It is not a good idea to "yell" or "spank" your puppy and then take them outside when they have an accident.  They may get confused and think that going outside is punishment.  While you want to correct them, if you are extreme, they may not want to go outside again.  Shake it off, and resume your schedule.  You have to keep it real.  Puppies train at their own pace, but a puppy can only hold their potty for a few hours.  A guide would be 1 hour for each month of age, plus 1 hour, so a three-month-old puppy should only be expected to hold their potty for 4 hours at most.     <br>  SOURCE:  These tips, tricks, and ideas were contributed from many brilliant minds.  Thanks for your help!|`|S5Lz35myaa	You can, however, using a litter box or pee pads show the dog it's okay to go in the house.  They will start in the litter box, but often times will then decide to go wherever they happen to be - if they can go in the house in the litter box, then they can go in the house outside the litter box.<br>  Personally, I would train them to only go outside, and avoid the whole "inside space".|`|1H0vYaJxaa	Yes I use a litter box for my Choodle and Pom.  I started with a littler box and puppy pads. Once as my pups started to use the pads I added a small amount of kitty litter. (the cheap stuff from the dollar store it is all the same don't let anyone tell you other wise) and once as they got used to that I eventually took away the puppy pads and used straight litter. <br>  <br>  Don't let anyone tell you not to do this a pom is a small dog and can not always go outside during extreme temperatures.<br>  <br>  The only problem was that I need to keep Stewie's butt hairs trimmed because they will get litter on them when he tinkles. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|kqa9VFrfaa	Yes, of course. I have even trained rabbits to use a litter box. Add a piece of scrap carpet all around the box to take care of wiping the clay litter off the pup's feet. And of course use a bigger litter pan than U would for a cat. Or get the largest possible size they sell for cats. Go to the hardware store or feed store and look around at all the different equipment there AND check out low storage boxes too.|`|Rx7wv4JLaa	Yes you can. <br>  <br>  Some people with small breed dogs find this easier and that it suits their lifestyle. <br>  <br>  Small breeds need to go more frequently that large breeds due to a small bladder. Some people also have disabilities or are unable to get out often enough for their pups. <br>  <br>  You train the same way you would for going outside with a few adjustments. Get some puppy pads with ammonia in them to encourage your pup to go on them. You want to praise him/her when she does go in the litter box. If you catch him/her going else where say no and take her/him to the litter box and praise if they go on it.|`|guAwifbBaa	Well its possible but its a dogs instinct to go outside. (or on the floor, depends how well you train it :P) but if you start young enough it might be possible. I recomend you start with newspaper training it and then train it to go outside. hope i helped =)|`|swTjhCznaa	I don't think that's a good idea.  Dogs are not like cats.  Cats instinctively want to bury their ****.  Plus, litter stinks and is really a turn off.  <br>  <br>  don't be lazy, just walk your dog.|`|qapJU3tMaa	YUCK, why would you want to teach a dog that it's okay to go to the bathroom in the house.  No one will want to come to your house because it'll stink.|`|d5781f30069ecf14d7c481d2dc40aec7aa	I am assuming this is an apartment dog. Yes, you can litter box train dogs.

D7KwEaoXaa	Hamsters are nocturnal. They sleep during the day, and play at night.<br>  <br>  You can't really reverse it, but you can do a few things that a hamster would find exciting and active during the day. That way he would be a little less active at night.<br>  <br>  - A hamster ball so he can run around the house a bit. (Don't leave him in too long, he'll pee and poop in it and that will get on your carpet.<br>  <br>  -The hamster tubes and tunnels that you can buy. They LOVE those things.  If he has a regular cage at night, and you attach the tunnels only during the day, he'll be VERY active all day.<br>  <br>  -Play with him in the evenings (for 30 mins to an hour) before bed. Maybe you'll help tire him out. Give him paper tubes to play in and chew up, teach him to do tricks for hamster treats, there are a lot of ways to play with him.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|ZTaFYgwbaa	hamsters are nocturnal you cant change it|`|GfvxVeZMaa	Er... hamsters are nocturnal they sleep in the day, and are awake at night.<br>  You can't change this.|`|6Zuvobqtaa	Hamsters are nocturnal animals and you cannot change that behaviour.<br>  Guinea pigs sleep when you do and are awake during the day. Consider that as a nice pet. Or get a dog or cat.|`|WPd4MYt6aa	Hamsters usually do that because they are nocturnal.|`|JwnHKTabaa	Um, they're nocturnal.|`|TUFoB5RMaa	you cannot since they are nocturnal.. the only thing you can do is place the cage in another room so that you won't hear the noise.   Hamster biting cage bars: It means that the hamster wants your attention.  This usually happens during the evening / night.  To stop the hamster from biting the cage bars, you can get it out in your room to run (always keeping an eye on it so that it does not get hurt) or else give it something to gnaw on.  If you place some toilet paper or an empty toilet paper roll between the cage bars where the hamster gnaws, it will play and gnaw on it instead.|`|qo06EpDiaa	Hamsters are nocturnal animals. Its just in their nature. You could try keeping a blanket over the cage during the day for about a week to see if that helps any, but its hard to impossible to change an animals instincts.|`|a6C6AXKWaa	During the day, you can have a poster of a beautiful crescent moon on the wall. At night, shine lights on it. The solution is discrete trickery like methods used in dictatorships like in the capitalistic American States.|`|0O0lnEgWaa	u can not change it.

NAGiNKFWaa	I wouldn't.  I think it would be a mistake at that age to let a puppy ever think it is o.k. to go potty in the house.  I would ask for family help or a pet sitter or dog walker, or someone from church or a neighbor.  Even if the puppy had to visit someone else house that day, that would be better.  You don't want to leave a puppy alone for that long either, because it might think it got abandoned.|`|OxFsslN8aa	Please rethink this plan.  10 hours is too long to leave a puppy.
UIM8X38Oaa	Oh Sarah, I'm so sorry.<br>  I can completely understand where you are coming from!!<br>  Please know that not everyone thinks the same way as angelica.<br>  I am so glad to hear that your horse has you ( a loving owner) in his life.  Some horses don't have anyone to care for them.  <br>  You did the right thing for him.  You don't always have to spend a fortune in vet bills and not everyone can and I understand that, this is why you are asking this question to find some good advise to help your friend.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that he has just been through quite a traumatic event and it might take him a day or two to start to feel better.  I would just suggest you keep doing what you are and keep an eye on him.  Make sure he has plenty of water to drink and if he is not moving around very good make sure you have the food and water right in front of him so he doesn't have to go far.  <br>  Just give him some time, love on him, and keep an eye on him for a couple days.  If he isn't doing much  better in a couple of days then you can call the vet to ask for advice.  Alot of times they will give you advice and give you some thing to do for him over the phone for free with out having to come out excpecially since they have already treated him for his injury.<br>  <br>  I have delt with similar issues before and those horses did the same thing, they took several days to start to feel better and start getting back to normal.  I don't know if you have ever had a serious injury or not but it always makes you drowsy and sets you back for several days.<br>  <br>  I wish you and your friend the best!!<br>  And I will say a Prayer for Him.<br>  <br>  Jenny|`|1WkO82e2aa	Since you already had the vet out, most will work with you over the phone. If you know how to give a shot ask him/her to prescribe some pain medication for the horse. Banamine will ease some of the pain and the horse will be more likely to eat normally. There are times that the vet wants the horse to know he is in pain so he will not further injure himself. If you call the same vet he/she may be able to help you treat this horse or explain to you what to expect. Most vets are not all about the money and will work with you as much as possible.|`|fc5e4f4741642787d64f7d84cccb7b94aa	Well you know he hurts and think how you feel when you are hurt.  The desire for food will not be very high so him picking is not a bad sign yet.<br>  Please take his temp.  If you only have  regular thermother put a string on the end of it so the horse does not accidently suck it in which would force a vet out.  This way you can pull it out yourself.<br>  He can be running a very low grade temp which should be expected since he's fighting the wound as nature intended.  If the temp is higher than low grade (101 to 102) just call the vet.  A vet understands you paid out that HUGE bill yesterday and can just take a moment for free mind you to give you suggestions or an option to pick up some other meds to help him.  He just saw him so he knows what's going on.<br>  Even if he doesn't have a temp and continues picking and not eating by tomorrow call the vet for just a phone consult.  Again most vets will not charge you and if your vet does when this problem is over and it's time for shots look into a more compassionate vet.<br>  Eating hay is the best for him since horses need to keep food in there gut and hay will do that.  Soak the pellets in water.  They will become like mush so eating them will be easier.  I"m not sure why something easier to eat will help since it's his foot that's hurt but you know your own horse.  He might like beet pulp too but make sure you wet that down also.<br>  I would worry about changing his diet right now.  Do not add any more stress on his system.<br>  Remember if the vet does have to come back out it will not cost you like it did.  It should just be a barn call and a little bit of his time and he might let you pay over time. <br>  Another thought is to listen to his gut sounds.  Just put your ear to his belly.  You want to hear all kinds of noises.  Popping, crackeling, swishing.  Obviosly he will be popping less but since he had this trama he could colic on you.  If he's not eating and there is little to no gut sounds you have to take action with the vet.<br>  I hope he gets better soon and it sounds like you have taken care of him since he's of an advanced age and still healthy enough for a rider.<br>  Good luck and I hope you update the people who did not blast you on how he does the next few days.  Remember check on him every hour if possible for a little while to make sure he's not going into colic.<br>  Kath|`|hoAeWwJDaa	Sometimes anti-inflammatory drugs and analgesics cause loss of appetite or nausea. Give him time to recuperate, as all good things take time, and primarily ensure he eats roughage (i.e. hay, good fibrous, dust-free, seed-headed, green hay with little to none debris or indigestible vegetation). Changes or excess nutrients can cause more harm than good right now, so stick to his normal hay ration and alfalfa cubes.<br>  <br>  Many folks wrap wounds themselves, soak/compress multiple times daily, and administer medications after only consulting with their vet, let alone paying a farm call and services fee. No accusations or judgment here. And rarely can you consult a large animal vet re: nutrition as many leave that up to your "management option and choice" and they focus on immunizations, diagnostics, prescriptions and symptom treatment and less on nutrition, activity, environmental causes/effects and exposure.|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	He's probably not eating his pellets eagerly because you have the medications mixed in there.  Most horses can tell, and won't want to eat it (but most eventually will).  If it continues to be a problem, or if he's not getting the correct dose of meds, then you can crush up the pills, mix it with just a little liquid (enough to make a paste), and squirt it into his mouth with a big syringe or wormer tube.  Soda works really well to dissolve the pills, but you could use a variety of liquids or apple sauce.|`|iiNAJfGCaa	When horses are stressed or upset they can go off their feed. After my gelding's favorite horse in the barn passed away he stopped eating his grain for two straight weeks. Usually it is the grain that the horses will go off because hay is more natural for them. I would NOT change his feed at this point, you don't want to put any more stress on his body. Just keep good, quality hay in front of him 24/7 and try giving him smaller amounts of his pellets until he regains his appetite. If his appetite isn't back to normal in 3-4 days I would call the vet and see what they have to say over the phone. You clearly love your horse very much and freak accidents are just awful when they happen. I wish you and your friend all the best.|`|6Zuvobqtaa	You don't have to have the vet come over, but you can call him and he probably won't charge you for it. <br>  Horses feel pain and he might just be in too much pain to eat. Just like you would be if you were sick or injured. <br>  Call the vet and see if he can suggest something. Sounds like a really old horse but I had one too and I know how attached you can get.<br>  <br>  Try some cut up carrots and small pieces of apples to get him interested in food , but don't push. A day or two without food won't kill him, but make sure he is drinking water.|`|B6zl0AJDaa	(((Hugs)))  I'm sorry your horse got hurt, it's really tough when it's an old timer.<br>  <br>  As for feed, go to your feed store and buy 2 things.  A 50 LB sack of rolled barley and a 50 LB sack of ground alfalfa and molasses.  You can let him free feed off the A&M but with the barley, take about a 3LB coffee can full of that, add boiling water and let it steep (Like oatmeal), then give that to him.  You may also want to add a 1/2 can of red flakey wheat bran so that his system doesn't block during this stressful time and add that with the bran just for tonight.<br>  <br>  My 3 yr old AQHA filly had that happen thanks to another boarder at the stable I was boarding at last year (Getting caught in a gate.) and she's fine now.|`|PWankIUpaa	Your horse has been through a very traumatic experience . I would be off my feed a bit had I been through this! <br>         I think I would NOT change his feed. I have seen too many horses founder because of this if this were my horse !   I would however watch him like a hawk however. Give him a day or two to clam down. This only happened yesterday. When one of my morgan's were very young some boys used firecrackers to scare the horses in the pasture. My filly got her head caught in a bob wire fence ( I still do not know where it came from. She was traumatized for several days and I just kept the medicine on her face and was very quiet around her. <br>  <br>  I used some  kind of salve until the scares went away and She finally got o.k. .<br>  <br>  Patience is what I would recommend here not a rush to change what the Vet has already done. Do you have any experienced horse people around you? If so go to them and ask advice . Be very candid and from my experience they have always been eager to help and usually are .|`|jyGTlpzTaa	You need to get hold of some bran, or linseed, to make a mash for him to tempt him. I really dont think oatmeal is a good idea.<br>  <br>  If you cant afford a vet, why do you have a horse?<br>  <br>  Edit: I'm sorry, but its the truth! Horses are expensive, it is irresponsible to keep them when you cant afford veterinary treatment. What happens if your horse becomes worse and you cant afford the vet and he dies because of it???????<br>  <br>  Keeping him alive when he is suffering and not being able to afford the vet is no better than selling him for glue.<br>  <br>  Oh yes, cos that was clearly my intention *rolls eyes*
DtkLsetkaa	You could also try clipping her nails.  Little clippers are like $5 at petsmart, and work very well.  Make sure you are keeping your hands well washed if she does scratch, the cuts can be kinda dirty.  If she starts scratching you while playing, meow like a cat would if it were hurt and walk away.  That's telling her in her own language that what shes doing is not acceptable.  And thank you for not declawing :)  Smart, smart move.|`|xd7tSmQeaa	It's a cat.  Cats have sharp claws.  Your vet can apply plastic coverings on the cats claws to help the scratching.   <br>  <br>  Don't declaw.  It's mean.|`|AMCmEhUxaa	1. Do not declaw, it is cruel.<br>  2. Do not play with her when she starts scratching. Put her down and walk away every time until she realizes she cannot scratch.<br>  3. If softpaws are necessary try having one person "scruff" her while the other puts them on. And try to get her when she's in a good mood.<br>  4. If you still cannot get the softpaws on-go to the vet. They will do it for you for a fee.<br>  (Do not keep softpaws on for more than a month without a break or her paws will get really gross and can even get infected)|`|gBkbnC19aa	File down her nails. Declawing is kinda cruel since they actually have to cut off their knuckles when they do that. So try to file them down instead.|`|NPr6dVYZaa	You can go to your vet and have them show you how to safely clip your kitties claws. Mine get done every coupls of weeks.

Mira antes de nada te aconsejo que acudas a un buen veterinario para que te asesore sobre el tema. Mi opinion es que aun es demasiado peque?o para esterilizarlo pero que en cuanto pasen un par de meses no dejes de hacerlo. Te evitaras que mee en cualquier lugar de tu casa para marcar su territorio. Y por cierto, mi gato esta castrado y no por eso se ha puesto gordo y dormilon...Tambien deberias esterilizar a las hembras si no tienes pensado criar. Yo no se lo hice a mi gata porque me daba pena y estuve tratandola durante a?os con pastillas para inhibir su celo. El resultado fue que le salio un bulto en una mama que hubo que operar y gracias al cielo al hacer la biopsia resulto no ser cancerigeno. Asi que para evitar da?os mayores la mejor solucion pasa por esterilizarlos.  Cuidalos mucho y suerte!|`|t4HLg1Rdaa	debe de estar mas desarrollado  tengo entendido estan <br>  muy chico consulta a un veterinario  el te sacara  de la duda.<br>  ok cuidate besos<br>  bye atte frank  valentino|`|6DdbdrYqaa	La edad de esterilización es de por lo menos unos 6 meses. Es bueno esterilizar a los gatos machos, ya que así se evita que salgan y les pase algo, además no se ponen a orinar para marcar su territorio. También es mas aconsejable que esterilizes a la gata ya que es la que quedara embarazada y te llenaras de gatitos..............|`|7yUJrzLBaa	jajajajajajajaja !!!!!! QUE BUENO !!!!!<br>  bueno.... ejem.... ahora en serio. <br>  es un poco peque?o creo que los esterilizan a partir de 8 meses mas o menos, consultalo con un veterinario.<br>  jajajajajajajajajajaaj !!!!!|`|8637880e971632626cd18d1223ab97a5aa	Hola. Seria ideal que esperes hasta los 5 ó 6 meses que es cuando están totalmente desarrollados. Igualmente consultálo con un veterinario que te lo va a saber explicar mucho mejor. Y con respecto a la respuesta que te dieron de que es más fácil castrar a la gata que al gato, yo te digo que eso es una cuestión PURAMENTE MACHISTA. Si hablamos de la operación en si... no hay que ser muy sabio para darse cuenta que en un gato es más sencillo ya que en la hembra hay que abrir la panza, más el corte de ovarios... Cuando en el macho es sólo un corte superficial en el escroto... Y es más, si querés quedarte tranqui, CASTRáLOS A LOS DOS... Ni ella va a quedar embarazada ni el va a andar haciendo macanas por ahi... Que tengas suerte...!|`|MLBCJvKUaa	Puedes castrarlo, no hay problemas, los gatos pueden ser castrados a cualquier edad,  hay veterinarios que son partidarios de operarlos prematuramente, a fin de evitar riesgos de conductas indeseables, lo gatos machos son capaces de reproducirse  ente los 6 y 9 meses de edad, período en el que alcanzan la madurez sexual. En esta etapa, probablemente empezarán "marcando" sus territorios rociando una orina de olor penetrante en su mobiliario, las cortinas, y prácticamente en cualquier lugar de la casa. También, y en la primera oportunidad, los machos pueden intentar escapar de casa en busca de una pareja, con los consiguientes peligros que implica la calle y el aparearse con gatas no vacunadas, tales como el SIDA felino, hepatitis, etc.<br>  <br>  La conducta que él tiene, debe ser un juego, ya que si las gatas no han entrado en celo, porque tienen 3 meses, es imposible que él perciba la se?al de apareamiento.<br>  <br>  "Las gatas son hembras poliéstricas estacionales que alcanzan la madurez sexual en torno a los seis meses de vida y se siguen desarrollando hasta los nueve o diez. En cuanto a los machos, éstos son mucho menos adelantados, no completando su predisposición para la reproducción sexual hasta que no llegan casi al a?o de vida"<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mascotasyhogar.com/mascotas/gatos/salud/?pagina=mascotas_gatos_salud_006_006" rel="nofollow">http://www.mascotasyhogar.com/mascotas/g...</a><br>  <br>  por lo pronto, creo que urge más esterilizar a las chicas, la idea, en cualquiera de los casos es hacerlo antes de los 6 meses , pudiendose hacer desde los 3 meses.<br>  <br>  ojo: si esterilizas a las gatas a los 8 meses, como te han dicho,  ya habrás tenido muchos gatitos!!<br>  <br>  tienen celos cada 3 meses y el gato responde a ellos.<br>  <br>  saludos y suerte|`|STdfEVRAaa	no creo q esta aun peqe?ito , espera mas tiempo, mejor llevala al veterinario para q te diga cual es el mejor momento|`|d945d7ca91dc31c04d9bf6a2a19ee026aa	no se pueden castrar hasta los 6 meses|`|n9g9pcyTaa	Es un poco pronto.

MHKe8zApaa	no fue muy difícil leer tofo :) .<br>  Yo estoy totalmente a favor de la adopción. Me parece que es un acto de lo mas hermoso, saber que le diste la oportunidad a un animal indefenso de morir en la calle. <br>  No voy a decir que no me gustaría tener animales de raza(muero por perros como el samoyedo, husky, sharpei y gatos como el bengalí y el ragdoll), pero nunca podría hacerlo, es una cuestión de ética... Ahora si tengo que defender a algunos criadores, yo conozco a varios, que cuidan mucho a sus animales y los quieren como a sus hijos y no los explotan. Aun así sigo estando en contra de la venta de animales, a mi parecer es como tomarlos como objetos además de que fomentan a la producción de "granjas de mascotas", donde tienen animales en pésimas condiciones, sin revisión veterinaria, en jaulas minúsculas y donde están obligados a tener camadas tras otras.<br>  En este momento tengo seis gatos(y tuve muchisimos mas, casi todos recogidos de la calle) de los cuales uno lo adopte en una protectora, dos del medio de la calle, uno en el medio de una monta?a(los descarados due?os lo tiraron en el medio de la nada porque tenia pulgas...) y las otras dos llegaron a nuestras manos por otros medios. De todos los gatos que tengo y que tuve solo el adoptado en la protectora es de raza(siamés). Perros también tuve montones, ahora tengo tres recogidos de la calle, pero también tuve perros de raza, tres pastor alemán(dos eran hijos de la perra de mi abuela y uno adoptado), una grandanesa(no se porque la compro mi padre) y una doberman(un amigo que tenia un criadero de fundió y practicamente de rodillas nos pidió que la compraramos). Si me pidieran que haga una comparacion entre mis animales de raza y callejeros no podría, simplemente lo que cambia es que puedo ir por la calle a presumirlos(cosa que no hago)...<br>  tanto rollo solo para decir que en el único momento en el que compraria un animal(solo perros o gatos, estoy totalmente en contra de otros animales como mascotas, que de echo no lo son porque sufren con el cautiverio, aun los conejos y los hamster) es cuando ya no haya mas animales en la calle ni en las protectoras.<br>  Además, me parece mucho mas bonito un común europeo que un persa, exótico, sphinx, etc... =)|`|3aubK6uYaa	lo logre leer todo.<br>  <br>  creo que la mejor opcion es la adopcion de un animal porque de una forma u otra estas ayudandolo no solo a tener un hoga fijo si no que le das cari?o y el trato que se merece no solo como animal sino como el ser vivo que es.<br>  <br>  besos  :·)|`|LoaGbJk2aa	yo adopte una perra que un hermano mio recojio en una avenida muy transitada, la perrita casi lo mata un camión, si no es por que mi hermano detiene el trafico para recojerla, pero esto ya fue por allá de agosto, ya esta muy crecida y es bien tremenda, es una hermosa pastor alemán|`|SSRJfk36aa	yo nunca compre perros ni gatos siempre adopte y nunca me arrepenti de mi eleccion.<br>  Saludos|`|Bl38lZO8aa	la adopcion sin duda.tu misma has llegado a esa cnclusion!esos pobres perritos o gatitos abandonados k antes tnian una familia.n se como hay gente asi.adopta y ofreceles una nueva vida mejor,k sepan lo k es el kri?o d una familia d verdad.adew.|`|hEVRb0yxaa	Extensa pregunta! por experiencia propia te puedo decir que adoptar es la mejor opcion, tengo 2 gatas 1 es adoptada, y me ha dado hasta mas cari?o del que esperaba, todos los animales domesticos merecen un hogar digno donde satisfagan sus necesidades y sean tratados con amor y respeto, es muy cierto eso de que hay gente que se deja llevar por la raza de moda y compran un perro o gato sin estar concientes de que este animalito es un ser vivo que va a necesitar de su due?o toda la vida, una mascota no es simplemente un trofeo que lucir,estoy a favor de la castracion de perros y gatos para evitar que sigan naciendo tantos animalitos que despues se quedan sin hogar y llevan una vida de sufrimiento, muriendo de hambre, enfermos o atropellados en las calles, no esta mal tener un animal de raza, esa es la decision de cada persona, pero imaginate si todos adoptaramos, salvariamos muchisimas vidas!|`|yw7GQKa3aa	yo creo q es mejor adoptado xke ellos necesitan un hogar y ya an sufrido bastante y luego son muy cari?osos|`|zxYlH8JWaa	oh... adoptar..sin lugar a dudas.<br>  me parece tan cruel el comercio con animales.. creo que nadie debería participar en ello..<br>  de ni?a tuve varios gatos,todos recojidos de la calle. lamentablemente hay muchos, y viven en condiciones pésimas...<br>  mi gatita que tengo ahora, fue abandonada por sus anteriores due?os..., si no la hubiera recojido de la calle no hubiera sobrevivido este invierno... estaba muy desnutrida... se nota que es doméstica, y que la abandonaron... creo que tiene un trauma porque siempre que me ve salir a la calle llora desconsolada como si no me fuera a volver a ver...<br>  nunca entenderé los abandonos.. me parte el alma... ojalá todos optáramos por adoptar, y darles una vida feliz, porque todos ellos se la merecen.|`|t4HLg1Rdaa	lo mejor es adoptar un animalito  yo tengo adoptado un perrito y es muy inteligente y claro  quererlo porque es parte de la familia eso es muy inportante.<br>  y jamas maltratarlo porque  no es bueno.es cuidarlo y<br>  ense?arlo  de todo lo que se pueda.<br>  ok espero  que la pases bien <br>  atte<br>         frank valentino|`|00a0b761074068efcaad0ab569ea24ccaa	En mi opinión, es mucho mejor adoptar, yo tengo 3 perros adoptados, y son lo mejor que se puede esperar de un animal doméstico, pues son tan cari?osos y fieles como no se imaginan.<br>  Otra de las desventajas que tiene la compra y que no mencionas, es la compra de impulso, aquella que se hace en algun evento de muestra de animales y que sobre todo en el caso de los ni?os, se encaprichan en comprar un animal, y mientras están chiquitos y hacen gracia la cosa va muy bien, pero en cuanto crecen y empiezan a dar mas problemas o ya no les cae en gracia, simple y llanamente los echan a la calle, cosa que es por demás cruel y habla muy mal de la gente que lo hace, por eso es necesario educar muy bien a la gente, sobre todo a los nil?os, de la gran responsabilidad que implica tener un animal domestico a nuestro cargo, entender que no son juguetes sino seres de carne y hueso que viven y sienten como nosotros, que aman y sufren como nosotros y que es una gran injusticia y una deshumanidad terrible la forma en que muchos los tratan. Creo que la gente que adopta una mascota es porque tiene conciencia de lo que está haciendo, para darle amor a un animal, no es necesario que este tenga pedigree.

lo sai che i cani si possono educare? si hai capito bene EDUCARE !!!!!!, se tu invece di limitarti a giocare con lui, capisco che sia piacevole, ma si devono rispettare le regole, incomincia ad insegnarli a fare la pipi fuori, portalo regolarmente tre o quattro volte al giorno fuori a fare i suoi bisogni, inoltre vietale di smontare il divano e qualsiasi altra cosa insomma devi insegnarle a fare il bravo bambino, vedrai che la tua mamma piano piano si abitua al tuo boxer, che ti dirò anche a me fanno paura, quindi non ti resta che istruire bene il tuo cagnone e buona fortuna.|`|Yob0a26jaa	l'idea di comprarle una cuccia e metterla sul terrazzino non è male....quando fa pipì prendi un giornale arrotolalo e dagli dei colpetti sgridandolo per fargli capire che non si fa....dopo mangiato portalo fuori ....i suoi bisognini deve pur farli....se non hai il giardino..il terrazzo va bene...abitualo a fare i bisognini lì...e ti raccomando colpiscilo e sgridalo ogni volta che combina qualche guaio.......io ho un rottwailer di 5 anni.....non ho mai avuto problemi e lo abbiamo abituato a fare i bisognini solo nel giardino.in casa non esiste proprio....noin ti preoccupare......non soffrirà a stare nel terrazzion...se lo abitui da subito ovviamente..il mio cane è abituato a stare fuori ma la sera lo facciamo stare con noi per non farlo sentire solo.....certo..ne approfitta sempre (se fa freddo si piazza davanti alla sfusa e ti fa morire dal freddo,se fa caldo si piazza davanti il ventilatore e ti fa morire di caldo.......ma da quest'anno lo abbiamo fregato....termosifoni e climatizzatore.........in compenso però cerca di cacciarti dal divano....e noi per non fargli prendere troppa confidenza lo sgridiamo e lo colpiamo (non troppo forte...............anche perchè se si incazza chi lo tiene...è pur sempre un rott....)ma obbedisce e non fa nè danni nè sorpresine solide e liquide a terra.se diventa educato anche tua madre comincerà a volergli bene...|`|cY0odx4Eaa	PICCOLO CONSIGLIO..IL CANE DEVE MANGIARE DOPO DI TE...E NON LO STARE MAI A GUARDARE QUANDO MANGIA...<br>  PER ABITUARLO A FAR PIPI' FUORI CASA:<br>  PORTALO FUORI DOPO CHE SI SVEGLIA,QUANDO HA MANGIATO E DOPO IL GIOCO SOLITAMENTE ASSOCIA LE 2 COSE....<br>  NON PULIRE MAI IN SUA PRESENZA..<br>  POI CERCA DI FAR CAPIRE AL TUO BOXER CHE NON TUTTA LA CASA E' X LUI,MA CHE HA I SUOI SPAZI...IO FACCIO COSI' CON I MIEI 2 CANI...E ALTRO CONSIGLIO...<br>  VAI CON TUA MADRE AD ADDESTRARE IL TUO CAGNOLONE,SOLO COSI' POTRA' PASSARLE IL TERRORE,NON E' CON LA CONVIVENZA CHE LA SUPERI,MA CAPENDO IL TUO CANE..CREDI CHE LUI STIA BENE A SENTIRE URLARE?<br>  CONSIGLIO DA UNA CHE AMA I CANI...<br>  SE VAI A QUESTI CORSI,ANCHE TUA MADRE SAPRA' COME VINCERE LA PAURA...SOLO AVENDO FIDUCIA DEL PROPRIO CANE...<br>  CIO' CHE SPINGE LA PAURA E' NON CONOSCERE IN PIENO L'ANIMALE...SE OGNI TANTO QUANDO DISTRUGGE O STA AL TAVOLO LO CHIUDI DA SOLO IN UNA STANZA,NON E' CHE LI FAI DEL MALE..ANZI L'AIUTI A CAPIRE CHI E' CHE COMANDA E VEDRAI CHE ANCHE TUA MADRE SUPERERA' TUTTO QUESTO....<br>  BACI|`|m7rAWvaGaa	beh il cane in terrazza non sarebbe male beh oddio ogni tanto specialmente qnd fa freddo potete farlo entrare ma pensandoci il fatto di tenerlo sul terrazzo va bene ma è importante k abbia un posto dv fipararsi kne so una cuccia vbb ciaociao|`|R1omjbIlaa	Se il tuo cane é cucciolo non preoccuparti, é tutto normale. Con il tempo e molta educazione imparerá, sono animali intelligenti. Sarebbe buona idea trovare un posto nella casa solo per lui, con la sua cuccia , i giocattoli per mordere, e giornali per fare pipí dove poterlo chiudere quando non puoi vigilarlo. Lascialo libero quando puoi dedicargli la tua attenzione. Meglio se gli insegni a non invadere territori umani come divani, letti, anche se ti sembra un'ingiustizia in fin dei conti la casa é di tua madre. Deve imparare che i mobili non sono per mordere. Quando lo becchi basterá con un no secco, dopo di che prendi uno dei suoi giochi e divertiti con lui, presto capirá dove centrare la sua attenzione e come fare per vederti contenta. Tranquillizza tua mamma perché é solo questione di tempo e falle vedere che sei una persona molto responsabile con il tuo cucciolo|`|Xq1ou7JDaa	direi che hai bisognmo di insegnargli le buone maniere:)<br>  qui<br>  <a href="http://www.dallapartedelcane.it/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dallapartedelcane.it/</a><br>  <br>  troverai le "istruzioni" per risolvere diversi problemi, dalla pipì in casa ai danni.<br>  <br>  son certa che con un po' di pazienza da parte tue il tuo cane imparerà a comportarsi in maniera migliore e anche tua madre si abituerà alla sua presenza :)
