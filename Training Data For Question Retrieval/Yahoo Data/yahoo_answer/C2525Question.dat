20080926015323AAC8Gkw	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Peugeot	Peugeot 306 Electrics?	Hi everyone, I have a strange problem with my 1998 306 1.4 petrol. It will start and tick over on the drive fine, but when I turn the steering wheel anti-clockwise, the fuel, temp, rev and speedo gauge needles all jump and flick. Some of the relays can be heard clicking, and it will start to misfire and eventually cut out. I've cleaned all the body earths, engine and battery earth. I've stripped the column to look for a rubbing wire. I've disconnected the indicator and wiper multiplugs. I've disconnected the airbag. Checked all the fuses with a multimeter, nothing makes any difference! Any help or advice would be very welcome! Thanks

20080929112739AAD8Hzz	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Peugeot	1999 306 1.4 ecu/Lambda sensor persistent fault?	The ecu (sagem 96) fails to detect any output voltage from the lambda sensor. This has been tested separetely and found to be correct, and also substituted for a new one but the problem continues. Have tried an exchange ecu but this shows the same fault. Indicating the problem lies somewhere on the car itself. The engine diagnostic light is not permanently lit up. No other fault codes are present on the ecu. Typical emmisions are CO 1.1% , 200 ppm HC @ idle and 2.5% CO, 250ppm HC at fast idle (2500 rpm). The cat was quite new (but is probably mangled by now!) Incidentally I should mention I have replaced the coil pack (a notorious problem on these cars) Does anyone have any suggestions where to try next? Could it be the connection to the relevant pin of the ecu input? I'm at a loss! The car runs ok but fuel economy is down about 10%. Cheers

I have been to junk yards looking for a dash and only found one but the glass was stuck to it that was in Texas and now I am living in Florida and where I live you can't find dashes for eclipses around here.

20070219065819AA9RJ4g	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Flat tire mystery!?	Okay, I have this tire that sometimes leaks air, but not constantly.  after I pumped up the air, it does not leak air overnight.  Last night, when I noticed the tire was a little flat, so I pumped air into it, then drove about 30 miles and parked in a snow place, then the next morning, it was leaking like it had a hole.   It was sunday, so I couldn't repair my tire, so I pumped air again.  Today, the tire was full of air after 24 hours, and not leaking air at all (after another 30 miles drove back).  Why is that?  Is it my tire or something else??      Unless someone played a prank on letting my air go last night, but i doubt it because it always happens to that tire.  Any suggestion or idea?
