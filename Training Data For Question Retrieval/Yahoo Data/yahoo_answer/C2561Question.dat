There was no radio in it or the open cubby hole beneath it.  The bezel around the radio that has the heat/ac controls moves around freely at the moment.  The guys at Best Buy that install radios told me they could put a radio in, but it wouldn't be very secure because the bezel could still slide out.  Is the bezel supposed to "snap" into place when pushed in or is it secured by 4 screws/bolts as I'm guessing?  Anybody with one of these vehicles that knows what I'm asking.... please help.  Thanks.

20090222223541AARCdWT	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Chevrolet	2002 Chevrolet Cavalier won't start.  Please help?	The other day after driving about 50 miles it died on me as I was pulling into a gas station(speed about 10 mph) and then it cranked right up.  I assumed I had shifted gears incorrectly(5 speed).  When I got out of the gas station it would not start.  It would turn, start up and die immediately.  Although sometimes it would only turn and not start.  After about 5 to 10 minutes it started up and I tried making it home but it stalled out on me again going about 30 mph, and again and again.  Eventually it cranked up and did not stall again, until today.  It has been 3 days since the episode and I thought maybe I had bad gas or something, but just a few minutes ago I was installing a radio and went to go crank it and the same thing happened.  It will start and immediately die or it will just keep turning and not crank up.       Does anyone know what this could be?  I would be grateful for ANY help! Thank you very much.  Oh yeah, the Check engine light is on but it has been on for a few weeks before it ever did anything like this, also according to the auto parts store it says that there is a problem with the catalyst flow.  The guy said could be a vacuum leak, catalatyc converter or oxygen sensor.  Could this be causing the not starting and stalling problem I'm having?

Bike runs great, carbs are tuned, one day it stalled and took a while to start again so after waiting a few minutes it started up just fine. Week later rode the bike all day then turned it off and when went to start it up bout an hour later it wouldnt start again, so waited a few minutes and it fired up like nothing was wrong. I then changed the plugs, re charged the K&N and did an oil change.Then a  couple more weeks of daily riding and it stalled again and started up few minutes later, then later that day it stalled again but took way longer too start again. The fuel line from the tank and the filter is fine. Is the fuel pump supposed to make the *click* sound everytime you turn on the ignition? Im asking because it doesnt always make the sound, but even though it doesnt make the click sound it still usually starts. BTW this mainly happens after Ive been running the bike fast, higher speeds. Please Help Thanks

20090222231902AAHi9dZ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	The ABS light/lamp on my VW Passat stays on permanently, without switching off.?	Since my car (VW Passat 2.0 1999) went in for a service a few days ago, the ABS light stays on permanently.  Normally, if the fault has been resolved, the light should go off on driving a short distance.  This has not worked.  Took it back to the guy who did the service - he says it will go out and if it doesn't, he can reset it electronically.   Should I be worried about the brakes needing a lot more effort to work (on applying the brakes, it feels like the car takes a long time to slow down, but it could just be because I had been driving with a worn clutch which was also replaced during the service). What I want to know, is my car safe to drive? Is there any chance that there is something lacking/wrong in the braking system e.g. brake fluid, brake pads, ABS?  Thank you in advance!

20070515160428AAZvBJy	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	I'm having vehicular electrical issues.?	My 1981 Chevy pickup wouldn't start yesterday. The battery was fine. I would turn the key and nothing. Not even a solenoid click. So I bought a new starter and put it in today. When I turned the key to "on", all my dash lights came on as usual. Then when I tried to start it, the solenoid would click and all power would disappear. No lights, no headlights, nothing. If I pull the battery cable off and then put it back on I get my lights back but the same senario plays out when I try to start it again. Any ideas?

20070628192440AAexy3L	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Why does my Buick LeSabre chug and hesitate when it is first started?	I have a 1994 Buick LeSabre, that starts and runs fine, however.  If it has sat overnight or for a long period of time, when started it mildly revs up and down and "chugs".  We live at the bottom of a small valley, and when starting to drive it, uphill, it will not accelerate properly and hesitates around 20 mph and will not go faster until I get to the top of the hill and then the engine sounds like it is running fine and I have no more problems for the rest of the ride, no matter how long or short.  Recently, the battery guage has been lighting up red when it does that and goes away after the car gets running right.  What is causing this acceleration problem along with the "chugging" sound and sensation, with small little bursts of power and then backing down?  Does my question even make sense, since I am not a mechanic or car specialist?  Hope you understand.

20070709211535AAKByYX	Cars & Transportation;Motorcycles	A lot of gas but no go for pw50?	I have an 83 pw50 that was just reborn. I cleaned the carburetor and changed the jet. When i kicked it, with a little help from mr. ether it started right up. As soon as I moved the switch from start to run it took off and revved at full rpm for as long as i wanted. The problem was that I was not throttling it at all. No matter what I did to the cable, or the carburetor this thing was getting gas and a lot of it. It has a mikuni carburetor on it and the throttle cable is definitely not jammed. I am stumped and need some help. I have noticed in my research of this carburetor that the aftermarkets have an adjustable screw near the gas intake mine is not there.

20090203132205AAGv8W1	Cars & Transportation;Insurance & Registration	Car Accident Advice Needed ASAP...Please read?!?	Okay so here is the deal  My coworker was driving home one night, it was sleeting out,  and was waiting at a stop light getting ready to turn left into her apartment complex, then out of nowhere a woman driving a car in the left lane next to her rear ended her car causing  $5000 worth of damage to my coworkers passenger side read end.    The womans car has minimal damage to her front end driver side.  My coworker moved her car to the side of the road, and the woman, who had a baby in car,  was screaming and refused to move her vehicle from the main road.    A cop arrived on the scene saying she wasnt going to fill out a report because of the inclement weather, and the woman who ran into my coworker was irate saying it was my coworkers fault.  The woman then called for an ambulance saying that her baby had been hurt and that they had to leave.  After the two switched information , my coworker called her insurance and filed a claim, she then called the womans insurance the next day  and notified them of everything.  Well a few days went by with nothing so my coworker called the irate womans insurance and they said that she already had another claim in addition to the one my coworker filed and that they havent been able to get a hold of her.    Well lets fast forward to today.well the woman finally called her insurance and is claiming not only injuries  but is saying that my co worker was reversing (total lie, why would she be reversing on a main road) and then hit her car.     Well now my coworker is freaking out bc her insurance is saying that there are now two conflicting stories, and the woman is saying that she and her baby have injuries, and shes basically afraid that the insurances are going to side with the psycho woman and believe that she reversed her car, causing this accident.         If anyone can please give some feedback as to what you might think will happen please let me know.
