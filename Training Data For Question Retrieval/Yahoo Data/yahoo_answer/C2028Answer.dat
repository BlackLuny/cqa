That is a ghost. There are 32 ghosts. If you beat any of these 8 ghosts by 4 - 7 second depending on the ghost you'll unlock Baby Luigi. If you beat it, in the bottom right hand corner it will say something like "a fast ghost has appeared", also a new ghost will appear and it will be faster, this is an expert ghost.

EsjpRaVsaa	Firstly, the iPod touch Second Generation is not jailbreakable yet, but hopefully will be in a few more days. There is no ETA (estimated time of arrival) for the jailbreak yet, but yes, hopefully it will be soon. For updates and more info, go to http://blog.iphone-dev.org/ . To your question, yes, it is worth it. With a jailbreak, the main features are customization and games or apps that Apple doesn't approve of, such as emulators. If you are worried about your iPod "not working anymore," you can fix it with a simple restore from iTunes. If it freezes while running, all you have to do is reset it by holding down the Home and Sleep/Wake buttons simultaneously for about 5-8 seconds. If you are worried about it getting "bricked," don't worry, because the iPod touch can not be bricked. A restore from iTunes, like I said above will fix all problems. If you have more questions, go to http://www.ipodtouchfans.com/forums/foru... . Thank you for reading, and I hope you decide to jailbreak!    Jay    PS: The website in the Sources section http://www.chronic-dev.org/ is currently down, but will be back up soon. Thanks again.|`|u6LY5kItaa	No If you jailbreak it it will freeze and it will fry the i-touch and then apple will charge you $150 to fix it.|`|ZZG7Yd8baa	honestly there are a lot of free cool apps available to you...  i wouldnt take the risk...

She bought it for her bedroom and it worked fine there, but she put it in the living room, which is bigger, and it wasn't loud enough.    We solved the problem by buying a set of big computer speakers.  Left right and subwoofer.  They were big and loud, and I think they cost about $80.  But if she'd had a stereo in the living room we would have used that.  I think most people do that now, route the TV though the audio system.    Still, if you buy a 42" TV and it comes with speakers in it, it ought to be loud enough to hear it in a large room.

jLTDqVHsaa	Yes, you do.  Leaving it un-finalized will allow you to add more material to the disc in your camera, but you won't be able to do anything with the disc in any other device.    Good luck.

AA12137001	Well... that depends on what type of camcorder you have. List the make and model and the specifications about the still image resolution and we'll be able to help you.    Most modern camcorders can record pretty good images onto a memory card so it may be possible for you to get good shots.    I'm smiling at the use of the word "develop" with respect to camcorder pictures. The last time I developed a picture was in high school. Nowadays I just print images from my camera.    Paolo, Thanks for the link.    I'm sorry to say that your camcorder isn't very good for quality photographs. The maximum resolution for your camcorder is VGA, that's 640x480 pixels or around 307,000 pixels, about 1/3 Megapixels.    Expensive camcorders can record a much higher resolution than this, of the order of megapixels (rather than a fraction).    There are many low priced compact digital stills cameras that will provide you with better resolution. Aim for a 5 Megapixel Nikon, Pentax or Canon. Sony use Carl Zeiss lenses so they are also a good choice. Avoid names not associated with the photographic industry like Samsung or LG.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	You mean print still pics off your memory card in your video camera? Sure but they aren't going to be as good of quality as a digital camera.  Digial cameras  take great stills and not so great videos, video camcorders take great video and not so great stills.|`|UbSJPBuNaa	no because a camcorder doesn't use film it uses a tape or its digital.|`|AAgf2MAuaa	camcorders are for videos... on some photo printers it will print vids though.

I just don't use the QWERTY keyboard enough so after playing with my friends Dare which was also amazing I am getting that.    It just all depends on your preferences. If you go to verizonwireless.com you can look at different available phones and sort through them by the options you wish to have.    Hope I helped.
RpQfIQXmaa	jailbreak- cons:your apple 1 year warranty will be canceld or deleted if you jailbreak and if you don't do it right your itouch will be worthless.    pros:you can change the back ground and get apps that is free and in itunes you have to pay for it.|`|SqLIZQN5aa	Jailbreaking gives you many pros, but it only works for 1st generation iPod Touches, if you have a new 2G, it will break it.
aLR7vXfcaa	As long as you aren't roaming internationally the only "charge" for calls from an international caller will be usage of your plan minutes, no matter where they are its the same as next door for you.

GDgV3XKgaa	i c someone says hdtv does not mean in-built digital tuner........well, it does.  ppl are often confused between hd ready and hdtv.  HD Ready means u get a high definition picture.  HDTV means u get a hi def picture+ u get digital broadcasting.  i encourage you to read the article below|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	1.) Charley needs to get out more.  The "government" can't spy on you by broadcasting TV.    2.) The date has been pushed back to June you're OK for a while.    3.) The switch to digital broadcasting will only impact you if you get your TV with an antenna.  If you have cable or a dish you will not be affected by the switch.    4.) When shopping for an HDTV you have to balance price with features.  Look for a 1080p LCD TV.  That should take care of you for a while.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	>>because my friend charley says it's a way for the government to spy on us.    What? I've seen internals photos of DTV converters, and there's no microphone, no camera, no wireless feature... nothing that can track you and or communicate. Indeed, they look really barren inside, and are clearly made to very low price points. If there was a conspiracy, someone would have talked, considering how many people are involved in the production, most of them in Taiwan and China.    >>HDTV does that mean it has a built in digital Tuner  Yep. All new TVs have digital tuners. Only way around is to buy a broadcast monitor.
aLR7vXfcaa	Sounds like when they applied the new text message plan ..they either forgot  to add all the needed codes to your switch profile or they didn't go through the switch properly ...call cst serv..explain whats happening and tell them exactly what i just told you...most likely you'll need tech support (nothing against the cst srv but they don't deal with or may not have access to the switch) .... No worries its an easy fix!    Tink xx

XIGJaU6kaa	There are many music download sites and software, but the best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: http://www.nexusradio.com    It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.    I have been using it for over a year without any problems.    PS: Never use limeWire, FrostWire, or BearShare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!|`|SqLIZQN5aa	Well, you could do this: if you find your music on youtube, simply use an ONLINE (no downloads) audio extractor, and you have your mp3 file there. Just google youtube audio extractor if you want to look for one. I personally use listentoyoutube.com because its fast, and the only thing you download is the mp3 file.

More info on this can be found here: http://theiphonejailbreak.blogspot.com/|`|9074062b690eb970135492b0172931e5aa	I believe it does but be careful you don't "brick" your phone from using a software. It's garbage then. I'd go with an unlocking SIM card to be safe.
ElvQTpUVaa	If you have a cellphone that plays mp3's and has a slot for micro sd cards, you can simply copy songs to that card, and boom, instant poor-man's iPod.    I can' t speculate on price, but your specs aren't all that demanding.  I'd be surprised if you couldn't get anything like that for your price range, though it may just straddle the line (by a pittance).    I suggest the Sansa e260.  It's got about 4gb worth of space, has a screen, and seems to be in or near your price range.
FsPBIZOqaa	iPod can only support mpeg4 video,so you must make sure the video is mp4 format ,you need to have a 3rd party tool to help you to convert dvds and video into mp4 or h264 format, add them into itunes library, then sync to ipod.    Try Cucusoft DVD to iPod + iPod Video Converter Suite,it support convert video to iPod directly. Some other software need two steps: 1. convert video to avi; 2. convert output avi to iPod. That solution wastes lots of your time. We need only one step, direct convert video DVD to iPod. So this converter speed is far faster than others  download at http://www.mp3dvdsoft.com/dvdtoipodconve...  GOOD LUCK!:)|`|ElvQTpUVaa	If you're buying refurbished, make sure it's only from Apple.    "What i was wondering is if you could put movies you own on your iPod."  This is a very common question - it appears on this topic of YA just about every day.  How do I put videos on my iPod.    If your videos are on dvd, you will need a dvd decrypter to rip the video from the disc.  Once it's ripped, or if it's already on your HD as an avi, you will need a conversion program like quick media converter to transcode the file into mp4.  Once that's done, you just drag/drop it into itunes.

475c01dc76b1f175b986a137414d9e50aa	Do you have a lot of money?    To get EVERYTHING a "normal" studio has would cost 10's of thousands of dollars.    To get started, all you need is a USB audio interface and a microphone or even a USB microphone.  Maybe $100 - $200.    http://www.zzounds.com/cat--USB-Audio-In...    http://www.zzounds.com/item--SAMC01U|`|CfqQDn7Zaa	Well, it depends a little what you want to do.    But lets put a basic setup here:    A mix-table  A microphone (or the number you need)  A standard for the microphone  Some good monitor speakers and a good amp  A room that is basically sealed from noises outside, which can be done either by empty egg-boxes or build-in double walls, floors and roofs which have fiberglass insulation.    Depending your budget i would start minimum with a 8 channel table and a good Sennheiser microphone.    Microphone:   http://www.sennheiser.com/sennheiser/hom...  Table:  http://www.mackie.com/products/mcupro/in...

The rest of the memory is for music and video.|`|LA2yYmxBaa	NO, if you wanted music and videos and ect. on it to I would recomendd the 32 gig or mabye the 16...|`|nddJXGZ2aa	The 8GB iPod Touch would be able to hold TONS of apps. The only problem is that it only has 9 'home pages'. Each home page holds 16 apps, so, do the math, you could have almost twice as many apps! If your question is 'Do I have enough memory?', then the answer is YES! Each app is a few megabytes (with the exception of a few which are more), which is only about 3 out of 1,000 (in a gigabyte). So, you will DEFINITELY have enough memory on an 8GB. Hope this helps!

XIGJaU6kaa	Forget about Limewire or Frostwire. The best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: http://www.nexusradio.com    It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.    I have been using it for over a year without any problems.    PS: Never use limeWire, FrostWire, or BearShare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!|`|ElvQTpUVaa	Theoretically, LW is free.  However, I suggest you read the following.  I don't care if you choose somebody else for best answer, but please read the following:    To get music online, your choices are varied, and each comes with its share of risk and cost.    You can pay for the music  its legal (though that doesnt help if youre caught uploading the music to somebody else), and not all that expensive.  Problems include limited transferability of the music due to DRM.    You can download using a peer-share network like Limewire, but youll need to install some kind of client software (there are several networks, and may be numerous different client programs).  The risks:  the client may contain malware.  You can minimize the risk of malware by getting the program from the publisher, but not eliminate the possibility that the authorized program is also infected (or that youve unwiitingly mistaken a hackers page for the publishers).  You may also pick up some malicious code just by visiting the programs page (assuming it is the programs page).  Because these programs connect you to a network of other users, you will be expected to have some media to share beforehand.  Also, there is no way to guarantee the safety and quality of the downloaded media.    If you must go the peer-share route, I suggest foregoing Limewire (and its variants) and choosing WinMX or eMule.  Ive been using those programs for years and almost always get what I want.  Ive managed to avoid viruses (many LW users say otherwise) and when I finally tried LW, I discovered it was no better than my programs of choice.    You can also get music by logging onto internet radio stations.  These will stream music through your soundcard.  You can use any number of free programs to save the stream as an mp3 or a wav file.  Audacity will record streaming media, and it can edit the stream to make copies of that stream containing any music you want.    Let us not, dear friends, write-off the venerable Compact Disk.  Small, cheap, available in huge numbers through friends, family and your local library, a CD contains music you can copy to your HD ("rip") and then transfer to your player.|`|ENgt8hENaa	Yes its free. not necessarily legal, but yes its free.|`|2BatkpPtaa	YES ITS FREEEE BUT DONT USE ITTT!

There is also playback software available that (like Mplayer but dont go confuse this with the classic version of windows media player) that will skip the region check and play the DVD no matter what region the drive is set to.|`|eiJOdPgxaa	Depends  on the Region, and what Region your DVD player can deal with.|`|ko9Zy9k7aa	You'll have to be careful. a lot of disc things like DVD's and computer and video games from USA are locked so they only work on DVD players which are in US format like. Not sure if that works for Laptops too, but i would assume so. Only way you can find out on the specific DVD is by asking the seller or the company selling. If worst comes to worst you can buy it and if it dont work just sell it off again. =]    You'd probably have to sell it back to USA, or sell it to someone who has a DVD player which has the correct region settings if they got it from US.    If you want a DVD, go look at play.com. They sell them from Jersey, so they work on British Laptops and DVD players.    Xx

AA10326440	It depends on what your mother currently has for her plan right now and what extra features you want.  Let's say your mother has a $50.00 a month plan (this would be an older plan), and you want to add your phone to her plan, then it's $9.99 plus taxes, government fees and then extra money for texting, V-Cast (internet), etc.    Right now I have 3 lines on my phone bill and just the bare basics cost me $69.98 which does not include taxes, government fees or anything else.  My plan was converted from an older plan so I do not have access to unlimited texting unless I bump it up to the 700 minute plan....I have no need for more minutes so my converted plan gets me 550 minutes per month for 3 lines at $69.98.  Again that does not include the taxes, fees, government fees, internet, etc.  Now I have texting on my phone at $5 a month which is only 250 text/pix/flix which is plenty for me, my mother's phone does not have texting and my daughters does at $15 a month which gets her 1500 text/pix/flix to anyone on any network and unlimited texting to Verizon customers only.  So that's $20 more added to my bill.  Then my daughter and I both have V-Cast which is $15 for each so that's another $30 a month extra.  Then all 3 phones have insurance but mine is the only one that is $4.99 a month, the other 2 are at $5.99 a month each.      So as you can see it's really hard to say how much your plan will be for 2 phones if no one knows what extras you want, what the taxes will be for your demographic area, etc.    I believe right now if you go onto Verizon's website it shows the bare basics for 2 lines as $79.99 not including taxes, government fees, texting, internet, etc.  So that will give you a general idea and that would be for 700 minutes to share per month (this would be peak minutes, unlimited nights and weekends starts at 9:01pm and ends at 5:59am).    Hope this helps you a bit.  You can also go to http://www.verizonwireless.com and click on the phone plans.

Many viruses can be downloaded because they are given the same name as a song, particularly popular songs. Once you open them, it may be too late, and it will take a virus scan, at least, to fix up your computer. As you know, some viruses and trojans are worse than others. Some of my worse infections have been caused by my son using Limewire, one needed a clean reboot and reformat to get rid of. If you think it is worth the risk, then go for it, but do it on an old computer that the rest of your family doesn't use.  .|`|DsjfgUjaaa	Downloading limewire is safe.

dUyBF4yOaa	you can trust my answer im a top contributor in the playstation category.    Anyways... Sony has released this feature along with the trophy support back in July of 2008. So Sony has done their part. It is up to the developers to choose if they want to enable music playback during the game. Games such as super stardust HD, high velocity bowling, motorstorm 2 and even brain challenge already have this feature built in. So since its actually up to the developers to put in in the game. It really won't take that much time. I myself program some of my own games and putting in a feature like that could be as little as 10mb! I could understand the developers would not want to do this because they don't want the music they paid a lot of money for to go to waste.    So your answer is: the developers has the power to let music playback happen during your gaming session. Sony has just given the creators the option to put it in since July. On the xbox they have it mandatory to have music playback or the game will not get published. However if you want to substiute why not have your ipod with you on a dock or something?    you can add me on psn:  nanothunder    HOPE I HELPED!    you can email or IM me for all your other playstation needs at:  redlightning7@yahoo.com|`|0b915c12b3c905a690ee76903af0032baa	It's already been done, the developers of the game has to implement that.

In other words, go through the process   of sending and clicking on the send to phone button.    You can either download the ringtone or decide to have it sent (texted) to your phone.

qIR9DB9Haa	You dont need a D3 to take model shots. Any camera with a hotshoe will do, I have seen some amazing model shots done with a Canon G10. The thing you want is to invest in off camera lighting. Just having a situation where you can expose for a model and city lights is going to be difficult and my guess would be that most of those shots are done by exposing for the lights and then using off camera lighting to light the model. You really dont need a pro body, the G10 if your looking to save some money or any entry level DSLR like the Canon XTi or XSi. A good lens is going to be important though, the cheapest being the 50mm f/1.8 which is only $90. If you have some money you might want to get a 24-70 f/2.8. If you really have some money to throw down get a used Canon 5D and a 24-70 f/2.8. keh.com has some good prices on used Canon 5D.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	it's not the camera. give a monkey a canon 1D and see what happens|`|0AqkCOWIaa	You are talking Pro-Level bodies here.     The D3 is a good body. When it comes to the lenses, you will need a few. A good all around lens is the 24-70mm f/2.8 lens. That would be fine for your pictures. You will need other lenses for other things such as telephoto, and wider-angle shots.    EDIT: Andre, i know that. I am just being a tad sarcastic ;)|`|FeUmyxqqaa	cameras are stupid recording devices - they are only as good as the operator    a good photographer using lights can produce great images from any manually operatable camera    so any DSLR will do it, you just need to learn how to drive them

XIGJaU6kaa	Forget about Limewire. The best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: http://www.nexusradio.com    It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.    I have been using it for over a year without any problems.    Never use limewire, Frostwire, or Bearshare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!    How to use it: First download the software. Now just open the Nexus Radio software and click the "On-Demand" tab. Enter the name of the artist/song in the search box and click search. Songs you download go directly to your "My Saved Files" folder located: C:\My Saved Files.|`|BPZ4sGLnaa	Try this.  http://www.flickrmusic.com  is sure the best place to download from the Internet., especially since the databases are so huge, downloads easy, and I was provided with all burning software I needed..

eGpOIV12aa	With Touchflo (TF) running, battery life is not great, bluetooth kills it almost as much as GPS. With TF off, I liked the mogul better for the abundance of shortcut buttons, with TF, the pro is way better for touch responsiveness. More importantly, it is a better phone, the calls are clearer and the speaker is much better. The pro maintains calls in locations the mogul consistently dropped calls.    Pro:  -Reception is top notch from my experience with Sprint pdas.  -Camera is fantastic, as is the options for saving/sending pics (picturemail, finally).  -Media-Mp3 trimmer-make your own ringtones, built in. Media player is very good, with up to an 8gig micro sd and tv out cable being an option. Loud speakers, adequate headphones.  -TF makes WM life much easier. I'm a little curious as to why there is no "Sprint Navigation" page on the interface.  -Noveties- Teeter and the weather application are fun to play with and show off.  -Opera Mobile is a huge step above IE.  -Sprint services (TV, Navigation, Music Store and Radio) work as well as any other "EV-DO rev.a" phones if not better.  -Contact storage is easy and customizable with the "People" tab.  -Syncing the device to your PC operates as expected.  -Threaded sms.  -Voice dialing is far superior to the mogul, it's extremely usable and useful.    Con:  -Battery life not that great, which I expected.  -Omission of shortcuts- Certain features are not as accessable as I had hoped. The communication manager is no longer one touch away. Using 6.1, there aren't as many items available for the today screen as the mogul offered, such as the htc homeplug.    Neutral:  -Keyboard has more buttons and functionality, but the keys are smaller, I find myself mistyping when in a hurry.  -Bluetooth was great, but the battery drain made it useless.    Overall, it's a fantastic pda, phone and feature phone in one. Windows is upgradeable, so it will change with the times.

Ip-relay lets you call someone, but they have a person who talks to the person on the phone. You type whatever you want the person to say to the guy on the phone. It is totally anonymous, and it is also hilarious. The people will say ANYTHING you want!

If you have the iPod Touch, why would you need the newest one (which would probably cost you a small fortune). Now is the perfect time to buy one, it's only like $200 for an 8GB at Wal*Mart. So you could have the iPod Touch and save a bundle.|`|0Umym3h9aa	If you really need it then you have no choice. If you still have a quality music player then you don't really need the touch in the first place.     Lets look at pros and cons:    Pro  -The touch has many apps for free (some of which are useless btw)  -Beautiful graphics, touch interface, video quality  -Wifi for internet browsing  -Built in speakers  -It's Apple, so you know it's quality and durable    Cons  -Expensive, and limit memory for such a price (8 gigs for $239)  -Do you really REALLY need all those pointless apps?  -If you only need it for music then go and buy something cheaper with more space  -You need a wireless router to actually use most of it's best features  -Wi-fi isn't helpful unless you are at home. It won't work far outside your house and if you are inside your house, why not use your computer anyways?|`|N0VI2D59aa	When you are looking to buy a new Apple item, ALWAYS check here:    http://buyersguide.macrumors.com/|`|xdLLid3eaa	Yeah, you might want to wait another couple of months.

So what is out now is going to be out for a while. It's a prime time to get one if your'e planning on it. It's up to you, but I would probably get one. Otherwise, you'll wait for something new to come out and it will be really expensive and then you'll wait for the price to come down and then by that time there will be something new that will come out. It is a viscious cycle.|`|brqpbSLfaa	I guess. If you really want one then why not?

AQ4b4Iilaa	You are asking about compact cameras, yes?    You'll be wanting the Fuji F100D, it is very good at high ISO in low light.  I have the older F30 and it is fantastic in low light conditions.|`|7qoyVAIjaa	If you want to use faster shutter speed with no flash that will require high ISO abilities. That being the case a Nikon D90 will work well.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	By looking at your question I can tell you're not really well-informed about digital cameras. For that reason, I'm sure you're looking at digital compact cameras. Hence, both the Canon and Panasonic beats Sony and Nikon in just about everything. check out www.dpreview.com for detailed reviews, as well as a feature comparison and buying guide.
AA11068631	Only the person making the call pays for the call.  For example, if I rang you for 30 minutes, I would lose 30 minutes off my call allowance, while your allowance would stay the same.  Then if you rang me for 30 minutes, it would take 30 minutes off your allowance and nothing off mine.  However, if one of you is in a different country, eg, one in the UK and one in France, then you will both pay for the call, due to what are called roaming charges.  I hope this is clear, but if there's something you don't understand, please feel free to email me.|`|XZTf8Eahaa	Hello check your price plan again i am on vodafone and i get 100 mins free per month and when i looked at the small righting it said i can only make 7 free calls a day and send 7 free texts a day so i don,t think it works out like that. You only pay for the calls you make so if your boyfriend rings you he will be paying for the call not you. best of look|`|AA11256390	Don't worry, you'll get the full 600 minutes to make outgoing calls to any land line or mobile that's not included on the 'premium rate' numbers, like 08 or 09 (there's more but I can't remember right now). So if you're calling a girlfriend for example on a normal mobile or land line number then you could have a 600 minute call or 60 ten minute calls through the month and she would get the same if you both share the same type of tariff.

I wish it were true though.. This is what I do:    You can get free Xbox Live GOLD and Xbox Points from Prize Rebel. It is a free survey site where you earn points towards prizes. This is how it works:    When you do surveys, large advertising companies pay those Prize websites a lot of money for that advertising. Then they give a percentage back to you towards prizes. Its not illegal its absolutely legitimate. Its not like you getting free downloads or anything. your just getting prizes for all the time you spend on those surveys.     Plus its not like they're giving you a "too good to be true deal" because it takes a good amount of time and effort to do those surveys correctly and getting points for it. But its a great way for us to take advantage of it. I work about an hour a day on it and i just got my first prize after working on a site for about 4-5 days.    I would recommend Prize Rebel to anyone who wants free stuff. They have a points system where you earn points by doing those online surveys they have online, only you just have to make sure to give fake info and different emails each time and you never have to give your credit card or anything.    Quick List of Prizes:    -Wii Points  -Nexon Cash  -DS/PSP system  -Various accessories  -Wii/Xbox360/PS3  -Lots of different games  -Anything you want, just send them a support ticket and they'll buy you anything (like gift cards for EB Games or even eBay auctions, literally anything)    1 point = 1 USD.    Step By Step Guide (simplified):    1. Create an alternate email account at www.gmail.com (or other sites) and write down the username and password somewhere. Some offers need an email confirmation to get credited.  2. Sign up for the site using the above link. Give them your real email (they will not spam you).  3. Complete offers.  4. Pick your free item.    Tips & Tricks (highly recommend you read)    1. Use real info to make sure you get credit. You may get banned if you use fake information.     2. Download Roboform! I HIGHLY recommend this, as it will save you a ton of time when filling out forms. www.roboform.com is the link. It is free, you can just use the demo version and it's just as good (don't pay for the full version unless you want to). It's a lot better than Google Autofill also.    3. When going through giant lists of Yes/No forms, just hold down Tab and press the left arrow key over and over to do it automatically. Be sure to say yes to at least one offer to make sure you're credited (I usually just do the newsletters)    4. After every offer, clear your cookies. Lots of these companies are linked together and if you have the same cookies you may not get credited. To clear cookies, click Tools and then click Clear Private Data (it may say Delete Browsing History), and check the cookies box and click OK.    5. Frequently make new alternate email addresses and use them in offers to ensure the company doesn't know your info.    6. Use Internet Explorer because I've found offers credit more often with this because the security is lower.    7. Be sure to allow cookies on all sites and set privacy to none. To do this click Tools, click Internet Options, click Privacy, and then slide the bar all the way down to Accept All Cookies. If you have cookies off, you will NOT ever get credited.     The best part is that you don't have to give them your information if you dont want to. For example, if you just want Xbox Live points, they will e-mail you the code.    You can also look up tutorials on YouTube.    You can see a list of prizes and sign up here if you are interested. Hope this helped.   http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=93...|`|1kvL73QPaa	WHAT no of course NOT!!!!!  LOL microsoft makes wayyyyyy to much money from live to be given it away for free.|`|MnGGEMwBaa	Hmm.

3da28f1bbe5dc0fba1bd4efce35cfe4daa	Each update carries all the data from past updates plus any new stuff. The new update will only add a few new things so yes you will have the data from the old update plus the new stuff.

c1c3f15d1b507986be998c3d578230b9aa	In new cameras, look for a viewfinder (LCD invisible in bright sun), optical image stabilizer, and check battery prices.  High mega pixel settings take longer to process and may not be needed unless required for very large pictures.  Maximum print size for a 3 mega pixel setting is 8 x 10 inches. Click links below for more details.  http://www.kodak.com/eknec/PageQuerier.j... ...  http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h... ...     The Canon A590IS is a slightly older model that is available everywhere at great sale prices. Think it is a great camera and a best buy. It has auto focus, a viewfinder, optical image stabilization, and uses rechargeable NiMH batteries.    http://www.imaging-resource.com/PRODS/A5... ...  http://bountii.com/deal-1523871-canon-po... ...       For expanded wide angle or telephoto capabilities, the A590 IS is compatible with Canon's accessory lens adapters: A small button next to the lens bezel is actually a latch; press it and you can remove the bezel ring, exposing a bayonet mount for accessory lenses. Canon offers the WC-DC52 0.7x wide-angle lens, the TC-DC52A telephoto lens, the 250D 52mm closeup lens separately, along with the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them on the camera. (Note that the wide, tele, and macro lenses all need the LA-DC52G adapter to mount them to the camera. The lenses won't work by themselves.)     There is no one particular place to get great buys, but you may see something above that really helps you find the best buy. Click on the second link in the information above for an example then search for your camera of choice at the upper left.  Camera prices at this link change often.     There are so many cameras out there it is difficult to say which is best, but the second source link will be very helpful as it list most of the cameras out there with prices. The following information should help you know what to look for in a camera.     CAUTION   Do not overcharge!  Batteries can be damaged.  Use an automatic two or more hour Energizer Compact smart charger with temperature monitor, trickle charge technology, and safety timer ($9.76) at Walmart.  Use pre-charged 2000mAh Duracell ($12.97) or RayOVac ($5.97) batteries (hold charge one year) and a full cycle charge.  To preserve battery charge, use the viewfinder.     CAUTION   To prevent memory card corruption, keep batteries charged and don't delete. Wait for lights to stop flashing then turn camera off before removing memory.  For card readers, double click Safely Remove Hardware.  Select then click Stop and OK.     What gives a camera its picture quality?    The short answer is that it is mostly the skill of the photographer that produces high quality pictures. The lens and camera are very important, but the ability to set the scene, adjust the cameras settings, and hold the camera very still or use a tripod with auto or remote shutter actuation when required is what gets the great pictures.     Lots of great camera tips in this link.   http://www.danscamera.com/Learning/going... ...     My camera has 5.2 mega pixel, but I use 3 most of the time because it gives great results, is faster, and takes less memory. Also, it only has a 3 x optical zoom and 7 x digital zoom. I never use the digital zoom because making pictures larger works better on the computer. This is an old camera, but everyone is impressed with the quality pictures it takes ... like magic.      Check with the Geeks in several stores and compare prices.  Once you select a camera, read all about it in the owner's manual.  You can view owners manuals at this link, but will need to Login. http://www.retrevo.com/s/digital+camera ...     The source links show most of the cameras out there with prices and make digital cameras work better with help on cleaning camera and battery electrical contacts.|`|pvabglXhaa	You need to think about the type of photos you want to take.  Will it just be family shots or are you a budding scenery photographer that may enter your photos in competitions in the future?  Do you want it to fit into your pocket or are you happy to carry it around in a camera bag?    There are lots of differences with cameras these days.    For the price range you mentioned I would recommend the Panasonic Lumix.  I have one myself and it takes beautiful photos.  There are lots of options to chose from for your photos depending on where you are and what you are photographing.  It has everything from a macro setting to fireworks.  Do your research first.  There are some great discount camera stores on the internet where you can find a great bargain.  If you know someone that travels to Singapore or other areas of Asia then you can get an even better deal.    The only drawback with the Panasonic is that it doesn't allow you to change lenses and I can't shoot panoramic which I would love to do as I like to take lots of scenery photos when I'm travelling.    Best of  luck!|`|cc030d61dc9bcfd7d41ed6138df0d0b1aa	All of the major brands are good. Choose a brand that appeals to you. Then you have to think about getting a spare battery, what size memory card, if you want an extended warranty, how much you can afford, what size zoom, if you want manual controls, the size of the camera, finding a reliable place to purchase it, and the list goes on and on and on.......    The first thing to realize is that almost any digital camera will take good pictures. If more people would read the manual more than once, they would be able to take better pictures. Usually, the person assumes it is the camera when it could be them not knowing exactly what to do. Just give yourself more photographic knowledge by doing more reading on the internet.    I really believe buying a camera is an individual choice.  The person needs to read alot of reviews on cameras so they can decide on the features that they really want and need.  Go to the store and hold them so you can see if they feel comfortable in your hands. If possible, take some pictures in the store to check the quality of the pictures.  I can only give a suggestion of what to look for in a new digital camera.  Good Luck        my suggestion  go to this link for help   http://reviews.cnet.com/digital-camera-b...

75WoHlWxaa	I'm afraid that, in order to lower the price of the PS3, Sony removed its ability to be backwards compatible after a while. So unless you had one from more or less its release, you won't be able to play your PS2's games on it.|`|HekFanRvaa	if you just bought your 80GB PS3 recently, it wouldn't play PS2 even if you download that update.

Your ps3 does not have ps2 parts therefore no ps2 play|`|RTNpd7UZaa	Only the 60 GB PS3s have the actual game hardware from the PS2 in them for backwards compatibility.  In the first 80 GB versions Sony removed the hardware and replaced it with software emulation for most games, as well as some USB ports and the card readers.  The newest systems of any hard drive size do not have any backwards compatibility at all.    Plus, I assume you bought your PS3  to play PS3 games.  Do yourself a favor, go out and buy Metal Gear Solid 4, NHL 09, and Call of Duty.  I guarantee you will never play another PS2 game again, except to play through the entire Metal Gear series in order that is.

Look for a camera around 6 mega pixel ~ you can get something like an Olympus which you will be able to print off, certainly to A4, and I'm thinking now about your project for GCSE ~ they come with a zoom, but it will not be a zoom like you can get on the expensive cameras ~ but remember that with 6 or above, you will be able to crop and print to full size to give you the result you want.    Don't try and "run before your can walk" is an old fashion saying, and its not meant to be rude, you will find that what I have said will see you through your project, and then you can look at spending money and get something like a digital SLR with inter-changable lens which will further enhance your results.    Hope this helps.

You can try to minimize signal loss by elevating the stick (using it in an upper level near a window) however if you are too far from the closest cell tower then this still would not be sufficient.

If they wanted to let you have free reign they would have either told you the code or not changed it when you guessed the first one.<br>  <br>  There is no way around the code. The only way it can be reset is to call DirecTV and verify (by answering a lot of questions) that you are, in fact, the account holder (not a spouse, not a child, not a cousin, not a best friend), and the CSR ALWAYS documents who the caller is stating they are (or if they sound male/female, young/old) so even if you do manage to get them to reset the password you WILL be caught.

oq3PwWA0aa	Actually, I would go with the first one 1080p is virtually unnoticeable on a display that small.  You would have to sit less than a foot away from the screen to see any difference.<br>  <br>  1080p on anything under 40" is a pure marketing ploy.<br>  You hear that 1080p is the new format so why not thorugh that on all your new models too push them<br>  <br>  update:  I would say go ahead with the Sony for reliability purposes.  I hear bad things about acer. Also to see thedifference from 1080p and 720p on a 23" you would have to sit 2.5" ft away from the screen anything else is you wouldnt notice .|`|usIma0vIaa	Well 1080 p is better<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAk6vBB6T3E&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAk6vBB6T...</a>|`|Zcwv7rwwaa	I'd go with the second choice.

AA10959572	If you copied from your camera to your USB drive without converting, then this has to do with the codec used (the video format) and the software to play it that are not fully compatible with the camera's codec/format.<br>  <br>  You would need to know the exact Codec/format so to get them for your computer.<br>  <br>  If you converted it using a software, then it's the software that didn't (wasn't able to) convert it properly.<br>  <br>  It can be fixed using a video editing software (I use Ulead)<br>  <br>  It would have also to do with how you are planing to view this video, what format/what device, etc.<br>  <br>  Personally, I use only standard high quality MPG/MP2 (DVD format) for all my videos (for editing) and for device playback, I use DivX / Xvid format, for which, the best conversion software is PocketDivXEncoder.

6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	The page you have linked refers to a camera bundle. It includes the camera, 4 AA rechargeable NiMH batteries (not sure of the capacity, though), plus a charger and a soft case.  The bundle doesn't include a memory card, so you will have to buy one. The S5700 can use either xD picture cards or SD memory cards. I recommend you get an SD card (2GB is a good minimum). Just make sure it's a fairly fast card (which you need for video). So, either a Class 4 or 6 card, and not the slow, Class 2.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	No current P&S cameras have batteries inside ... while they do reside inside the camera while being used, they are designed to be removed for charging.    In the case of the S5700, it uses either AA disposable cells or AA NiMH rechargeable batteries.  The camera is optimized to use the NiMH batteries.  You will want to buy a charger and spare batteries soon after you buy your camera.
rx2YBUG8aa	u have 1 yr manufacturer warranty still in place? if u do, i think u can tell them u have a problem with ur bb and they will request a refurbished bb phone with perfect cosmetic. Well, they usually do that if its under bell canada. if not, get that traveler battery and the charger. so u charge the battery in a little adapter and pop it in to ur phone after it finished charging... u could also ask for a dock for ur bb... gl|`|Stv5TGwBaa	Assuming that you have the right cable, the port itself could be damaged.

Jn09dNMvaa	on my pedal board i currently have a Jekyll & Hyde overdrive. it is a tubescreamer variant made by Visual sound and it is very unlikely that this pedal will give you what you are looking for. if you have a tube amp these work better. anyways its just an overdrive. it really only helps make great tone even better. I also have a Biyang ds-8. it is an inexpensive Made in China rat clone. and it is good, and inexpensive. its a recent addition to my board and i am very impressed. it is relatively low noise, and it has great sounding distortion in three different voicings. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/BIYANG-DS-8-MOUSE-BRAND-NEW-SERIES-U-S-SELLER_W0QQitemZ250378053050QQcmdZViewItemQQptZGuitar_Accessories?hash=item250378053050&_trksid=p3286.c0.m14&_trkparms=72%3A1205%7C66%3A1%7C65%3A12%7C39%3A2%7C240%3A1318" rel="nofollow">http://cgi.ebay.com/BIYANG-DS-8-MOUSE-BR...</a><br>  <br>  ebay's the best place to get one. at 40 bucks with shipping it is very hard to argue with that pricing. I pulled the trigger for one and do not regret it at all. I was about to buy a $140 pedal, and the Biyang is just as good. Biyang also makes more metal oriented pedals might be worth looking into. They are small and obscure, but i am still in shock over how good this pedal sounds. makes similar offerings by other companies seem like a joke. It made my mg15 marshall practice amp sound good. that thing is a piece of crap that i had abandoned long ago. <br>  <br>  also biyang's soundclips are pretty terrible. but i have yet to find a company with good sound clips of their pedal though. anyways, i understand how hard it is to find a good dirt pedal. some are just over-hyped, and other are just plain bad. finding the jems is hard as hell. especially considering how hard it is to demo them.

VPnCk2Muaa	I don't understand your question, so here's how to set it up:<br>  <br>  Get your modem, wireless router, and wireless adapter. Have the cable cord going into the modem. connect the modem and the router by attaching the ethernet cord (there should be only one slot on the modem, and the slot by itself on the router and the router should come with the ethernet cord to do this). Plug in any cords starting with slot one for the ethernet cords for your computer or whatever you need to plug in. Then, turn off the router for 20 seconds. Turn it back on and plug in the wireless adapter for your Xbox. Turn on your Xbox and go to settings at the dashboard. Go to network settings, and find the option to select your router. Test the connection again, and everything, including any else you have plugged into  your router should work fine.|`|ckeVm0sNaa	Yeah, the router will work with xbl, however, you either have to run an ethernet cable to the back or your xbox, or conversely have a wireless adapter (included with the elite consoles).

The bad thing about the PS3 is that its expensive|`|dKFiH9Noaa	a ps3 would bring in a lot more money. but personally im more of a nintendo fan.|`|dKDua2Tvaa	Alot of people want a wii since it is very popular with grown ups and children. The wii is cheap too.|`|qc2W5U62aa	Wii would be my suggestion. On the wii, the controls have many different options on games and the games are a lot of the time fun to play with friends. Wii games can also hook gamers into playing some games over and over again and not get tired of it. An example is mario kart wii or super smash bros. brawl. On the wii you also have the option to buy the internet if you want it (one time pay). I have a wii and i am very satisfied with it :D. People who don't really like to play with friends or can't also have many games for them to be pleased also. I personally recommend the wii since it's for everyone and on the internet if you search. You'll find the the wii is the number one console for 2008. It's also WAY cheaper.

wQiGnJepaa	Some VCR's run their motors briefly when power is restored. Perhaps the tape that was in it loosened up and got knocked off a guide, and now the VCR won't turn on because of the tape jam.    While you're looking for the fuses suggested by another answerer (good idea), visually follow the tape through its path and see if it's going someplace it shouldn't of is especially loose. You should be able to fix that and if it still won't go, try manually ejecting the tape by turning some of the visible gears on either side of the tape. Be careful and don't force anything.|`|AQafh1fEaa	It's possible that a slight power surge occurred either during the blackout or when the power came on that would cause the VCR to stop functioning. My recommendation is to BUY A FREAKING DVD PLAYER AND GET WITH THE TIMES!|`|AhO0Uoppaa	might be a fuse inside the vcr that has blown, crack it open and look for any fuses, Most likley to be clear quick blow fuses, you should be able to pick up a new one at radioshack etc. Other than that pick up another vcr they are gonna be cheap.

You just have to drag it into the movie part and then when you unplug your ipod it will be in the video slot.

The best trick is to quick scope . hold the aim button for 1/2 a second and shoot at the target. this is easier than no scoping|`|8ygYvN1Caa	So u aim at the person then go back to the hip and fire a few times it has a 7/10 chance of hittin|`|vLXXkZGLaa	steady aim...other than that sensitivity

EsdqLD9Saa	Ok it depends on the special effects you are talking about. There are a couple types. For instance if you are talking about explosions and stuff, you probably want to have a chroma key software. Chroma key is like a green screen software. If I were you I would buy Composite Lab Pro from http://Fxhome.com. Then download some free stock footage from http://www.detonationfilms.com. In short stock footage is footage of actual events with a chroma back drop normally black, white, or green. You then put the explosion/smoke/fire/sparks etc. into your compostiting software. You key out the background and place it in the desired location. If you just want to do green screen, then here is a description of how hard that can be from a previous post of mine.    Quote:    First off it is called a green screen, or a chroma key back drop. Essentially it is just a simple piece of green material used to move an actor to a location that you cannot get to, or for whatever else you want. You can get professional ones, made of muslin running about 50-200 bucks depending on where you go and what size, I got mine, 10ft x 12ft for $18.00 on ebay so look around. Check out tubetape.com, they have some great deals. Also if you get one you need a program to key out the green, they run about $100-1000 depending on its other features, I would recommend fxhome.com product called Composite lab pro. It is very nice and easy to work with. If you want more info just let me know! Oh and remember just getting one isn't the only thing to do, you need good lighting to get a good result, here are some good videos on youtube.    http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6brdwY-d...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2yja9-Tc...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eya3gBuA0...    PS  indymogul.com is a great site for new and upcoming filmmakers, it has lots of tips and tricks, and forums for help with this kind of thing!    End Quote:    Oh and then there are lightsabers. For that you need software that can create them for you, ie. lsmaker, or Effects Lab Pro, (from the same place that has composite lab pro, fxhome.com.)    Hope this helps...    If you ever want any spfx done that you don't want to take the time to do, let me know at guardian_angel_ministries@yahoo.com I will edit it for you. I can do green screen, explosions, muzzle flash, lens flares, lightsabers etc. To see an example of my work go to http://www.youtube.com/MattAlan01

GTtgzSIjaa	Hm,  iPod touch's are very handy, although i prefer the ipod video ;)    tip:  don't drop it in the toilet. i did that.  don't drop it in snow. i did that today.  don't drop it in spagetti. i did that last month ;)  don't let your little cousin get a hold of it to 'look at it' and have it end up in the bottom of your hot tub 3 minutes later. i, unfortunatly did that.  so i got a video ;)    take care of it, and if you hit the home button twice, music options come up. i.e. play/pause. if you want to restart it becuase it froze or somthing, hold down the home and power button until the apple icon comes up     don't pull a regina and drop it somewhere so the screen itself falls off (after the hot tub incident)|`|QB3dXwsDaa	This should help  http://www.apple.com/ipodtouch/guidedtou...|`|mxD3vkUQaa	It is really pretty straight forward.  Easy to work without the manual.  My tip is if you press the home menu twice it'll come up with an option to play/pause or skip a track :)  Oh and to reset it is to hold the lock/on/off button witht the home menu untill an apple appears on the screen.    X|`|J1R7jRn0aa	The best way has always been trial and error. Its all part of appreciating the experience. For example just yesterday i found (after owning my 2nd gen itouch for a month) that swiping your finger across a song or video brings up a little bar allowing you to delete it.    if you dont know how an app works access it and just mess around with it for a bit. If you dont know something that is quite important just google it, but the real fun is finding new things by accident|`|RMdfXuT0aa	Well I have a few tips but some have already been said I will just retype them anyway:    1. By double clicking the Home button you can Access the music at any screen on the iPod even when it is locked!    2. By holding the Home and Sleep buttons you are able to restart it if it freezes up on you and if it freezes up a lot plug it in a click restore and that could fix your problem!    3. To delete apps you just hold your finger on the apps for about 3-5 seconds and it will shack and now you can move it and delete it as you please!    4. To delete emails, movies, and favs on youtube and internet put your finger on the thing you want to delete and then swipe it left or right and the delete button comes up click it to delete or click else ware to stop that action!    5. Treat it like you baby! I don't know about you but I can't afford to replace one every year!    6. Please vote me best answer! THANKS!
wQiGnJepaa	A wireless router needs to be connected to the internet.    The best thing in your price range is to buy a used bicycle and go to the nearest public library :)    Another option is to buy a Boost Mobile prepaid cell phone, the push-to-talk type, and a USB cable for it. You can then access the internet at something like 10-20 Kbps (very slow) for $5/month which is the minimum you can spend with Boost and keep your service. Instructions for getting it going are on the internet or come back here with the specifics of your equipment for the right answer.    Perhaps what the wireless comment referred to was that if you have a wireless network card in your computer, it might pick up your neighbor's wireless router, then you can steal their internet; or you can offer to pay part of their internet bill, then they are the thieves, reselling their service.    You can get a wireless USB adaptor for your computer or laptop, try it, and return it if it doesn't work.
lEYrs02Raa	Here ya go:  http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2009/01...|`|MG6TyR4Uaa	Go to  Start  My Computer  Then click on the drive where you see your memory card.  Choose the folder containing you images on the card.  Right click on the folder.  Choose send to 'My Documents'.  Then go to 'My Documents' and rename to whatever you like and click and drag the folder to 'My Pictures'.  Done.    Hope that helps!    ***You don't have to add them to My Pictures. They will be on your computer for good as soon as you transfer to My Documents. My Pictures just offers better viewing options.
lEYrs02Raa	Take no more pics until you've recovered the photos, take the card out of the camera. Here's some freeware photo recovery software that should be what you're looking for:  http://camerarepair.blogspot.com/2007/12...    You will need to use a flash card reader with this software. If you don't have one, get one, they're cheap:  http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=sr_st?keywor...    AFTER you've recovered the photos, format the card in your camera to prevent this from happening again (dig out that instruction manual to figure out how).  Keep in mind formatting will also totally erase your card, so again only do this after you've recovered the photos.|`|pWKlusgXaa	Oh dear. Did you format the card? If so, goodbye pictures.     There may be some very fancy and expensive program/company/service that can get your pictures back for you, but unless you're willing to shell out a lot of money, your pictures are gone.    On the other hand, if you did nothing more than move the card from one camera to another, then the pictures might still be there. Connect the camera, using the cable, to your computer and open the device (it should show up in "My Computer"). Hunt around there. You may be in luck.|`|NZxvybYUaa	You could try this FREE program:   http://www.pcinspector.de/Sites/smart_re...  I've used it to recover deleted pics from cards, even ones that have had pics taken after the others were deleted. If you didn't format the card, DON'T.
AQ4b4Iilaa	Take a look at the Sony A200 and do a side-by-side comparison of features, you may get a surprise.|`|MG6TyR4Uaa	The D40 is the perfect place to start.   The Nikon entry level DSLR's start off with the Nikon D40, then the D40x, then the D60.  The D40 will be the least expensive and you can usually get a nice setup, sometimes with the extra kit zoom lens (the 55-200mm) for $499.  Don't let the price tag fool you though. Cheaper does not mean worst. In some ways this camera has more to offer than the D60. It has a wider ISO range and does a bit better in low light situations. Now, it does have less mega pixels than the D40x and D60 (6 compared to 10). But again, don't get hung up on mega-pixels. You will be able to get a really nice enlargement with the 6 mega pixels. And don't compare the mega-pixels from a point and shoot to a DSLR. The image sensors are completely different. In other words, you can a whole lot more quality from the 6 mgp DSLR sensor than a 6 mgp point and shoot sensor.  If you want to spend a bit more but still get a smok'in deal look into the D60. You'll get a few more editing options like d-lighting and the more mega-pixels. I've upgraded from the D60 but won't be getting rid of it. I'm going to hang on to it as a great back up camera.   I could ramble for a bit longer but all in all, Nikon offers a great product for people looking to take the plunge into DSLR photography.

XIGJaU6kaa	There are many music download sites and software, but the best FREE, LEGAL, and SAFEST site/software I have used is Nexus Radio: http://www.nexusradio.com    It is 100% free and they have a bunch of music you can search and download. I have not found any other free or paid software that has as many features as Nexus Radio.    I have been using it for over a year without any problems.    First download the software. Now just open the Nexus Radio software and click the "On-Demand" tab. Enter the name of the artist/song in the search box and click search. Songs you download go directly to your "My Saved Files" folder located: C:\My Saved Files.      PS: Never use limewire, Frostwire, or Bearshare...those networks are riddled with viruses and are heavily monitored for illegal file sharing!|`|MsV0Kv7haa	demonoid, limewire
pukl7kRTaa	I  To reactivate your sim card will probably be 25$, it is done at your service provider. If you are on a pay as you go phone plan and your minutes run out, the phone won't work until you top up your minutes. Or you can buy a monthly plan.  The Iphone you have to use AT&T as your provider (I think) so talk to them, before you activate your old sim card.

You have to give your Credit card, but there is a way to make it without. You simple go into the Itunes store> Apps> Free apps> Pick one> Press download> Takes you to the screen to register and then fill ever thing out and then there is a button on the Credit card page that says None( or something like that) and then finish and you have your Itunes account.

OkkOASTvaa	The versa comes out Feb 22.  It will be a great phone with more possibilites than the voyager or the dare.|`|wABZY2uJaa	I have had the Voyager for a month and I love it.  I have not heard of the LG Versa, so I am not sure about that.  Right now, I wouldn't trade my voyager for anything!|`|kd09MKiNaa	I am in the same situation as far as being torn between the Voyager and the Dare.  I have a few family members that have the Voyager and they love it! I have also played with the phone a few times and it is really nice and feels like a really sturdy phone. Not flimsy at all! I have seen the pictures of the Versa and it looks like a neat phone and all but I am not sure I would want to be attaching and detaching a QWERTY keyboard all the time. It would be something extra you have to carry around with you. Plus since it is brand spanking new it may have glitches and those are always frustrating. As far as the Dare goes if you are a person who like buttons to push the Dare probably isn't for you.  I have an iPod Touch and it can get a little frustrating at times to do emails on it.  You get use to it after a while.  It helps not having big ol sausage fingers too. My cousin has a Dare and he likes it but he said it took a while to get use to. He said that it adjusts to your touch after using it a while.  The Voyager has the best of both worlds having the QWERTY keyboard on the inside and the touch screen on the outside.  You can still text from the touch screen with the old fashioned triple tap text style. That can be good for quick texts especially!  Well I hope I helped out! I am able to upgrade in mid-February and I think I am really leaning towards the Voyager for sure!
2qkSYsdSaa	that would probably be the starter because I have had a tv that did the very same thing and the just replaced the starter and it fixed it.

If you think you could manage to burn another one, then you can increase the volume one of two ways. If you use iTunes, you can set the track to play louder (right-click, "Get Info", "Options", "Volume Adjustment", then increase it). Or you can get Audacity, a free audio editing program and open the file in there, and manually increase the volume that way. But I have no experience with Audacity.|`|hSHT4DyHaa	Other than turning the knob on the volume, you will have to reburn it.

QYB6oRacaa	You can get a defective lens from any company period.    If you continue in your quest of photography you quickly find out which lens come at what prices ..    For example the Sigma 30 f/1.4 and extremely sharp lens but it comes with front/back focusing issues. Sometimes you have to send it to Sigma various times to get the issue resolved.     However lets take a Canon lens - 17-55 IS a very sharp lens when wide open f/2.8 and like L quality pictures. For $850 bucks you will think it will come with no problems. Wrong this lens is a dust magnet and it has IS ring issues. So don't let anyone fool you ..    When it comes to lens you will see that certain lens have their strengths and their weaknesses and when you read about a specific problem about a lens - more often than not that series of lens are prone to that specific problem.    So bottom line read and educate yourself - just because they aren't Canon or Nikkor Lens and a 3rd party company does not mean that they are less superior ..    p.s. you have homework to do http://photozone.de/ :p enjoy!|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	i have both a sigma and a tamron lens mostly because of budget.  But i have found that they both take pretty good pics. it depends on what you will be taking with this lens.  But I also have 2 Nikor lens check out the comparisons on a site like dpreview|`|JXc0O8G9aa	I ordered a Sigma 10-20 last year.  After some tests it had some major "decentering" issues.  In other words, the left hand side of the photo began to blur just off to the left of center and got progressively worse toward the edge.    I sent it to Sigma for repair and received it three weeks later.  Took some test shots and it was still off so I sent it back.  Three weeks later I received it and it's now working fine.    Throughout the process I was reading forums and information on the internet and found pages and pages of people discussing quality issues with their lenses.    Some say that all manufacturers suffer from the same lack of quality control, but I can speak from experience, Sigma is the absolute worst.  I've never had an issue with a Canon lens and the only Tamron lens I owned was an older, cheaper version so it wasn't that great to begin with.|`|YNusCvP5aa	Some lenses are great, some are dogs.  That goes for all lens-makers including Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Sigma and Tamron.  The best thing you can do is evaluate a lens based on it's individual merrits.  For instance, the Tamron 28-75 f/2.8 is an amazingly sharp lens from all the reviews I've read.    There are some compromises which are made in some Sigma & Tamron lenses.  Sometimes they'll use a plastic barrel on a higher-end lens where Canon/Nikon would use metal.  Sometimes they'll only have 6 aperture blades where an equivalent lens from Canon or Nikon would have 8 or 9.  You might also find the focus motor in the lens isn't as powerful.    All that being said, you need only look at images posted on flickr with Sigma/Tamron lenses to realize there's some excellent quality glass being produced by both.

gGPLCGrFaa	Sounds like the disc drive needs cleaning. You can find a cleaning disc at most video game stores and they're relatively cheap - worth the money to get your Xbox working again. I had the same problem and the cleaning disc sorted it out fine. But there's always a chance that there is something different wrong with your console. If the problem persists you might want to phone Microsoft or take your console back to the store in which you bought it, or contact the website you got it from if you bought it online.|`|80d1975301ee4811339976c30cb84ab4aa	It sounds like your disc got scratched. If there are not any visible scratches, try coating the bottom of the disc with a very small layer of oil, then wipe it clean with a cotton cloth. If there are deeper scratches you will need to get some really fine grit sandpaper (2000-3000, you can find this at Checkers or some other car store) and some rubbing compound (For getting small marks out of cars paint. You can usually find this in the same isle as the sandpaper) Get the sandpaper wet and rub in small circles until you can't see the original scratch anymore. Now, take the rubbing compound and put some on a soft cloth and rub, once again in small circles, for a while until the disc looks brand new. I have tried this and it works wonders on old discs. It also works really well on discs that have been messed up by rotating your Xbox while it's got a disc spinning in it.|`|7MG2Yqllaa	Try calling 1800 -4my-xbox (1800-469-9269) they can solve just about any problem dealing with xbox!!!

3Mnhvbrwaa	You can put a TV above a gas burning fireplace but not a wood burning one due to the soot and carbon smoke.  The heat can also damage and discolor the TV.|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well I would put it somewhere else just in case it falls,the heat might cause severe damage to the TV screen.|`|3654ffdd8c11d6979dc64a3cb8ff3d2faa	You can and our company does it all the time.

HBNx77BBaa	Make sure the batteries are fully charged. I guess you will be using NiMH rechargeable batteries. These can fail after a time so if you can try a second set, or even just a set of ordinary AA alkaline batteries that would allow you to check you haven't just got a faulty battery.    If that doesn't work, try replacing the SD card or powering it up without the card in place.    After that I'm not sure where you would turn with a Konica Minolta camera. Even if you can find out where to get it serviced it is unlikely to be worthwhile getting it repaired. Sadly even classic designs don't have long lives in the digital world.    You might find some advice on the Minolta forum at dpreview.com...    http://forums.dpreview.com/forums/forum....
AA10334430	All channels do not broadcast in high definition, this change is only the switchover from the analog signal to the digital signal. If you buy an hdtv, or are subscribed to cable/ or satelitte television, you will not be affected. The best analog to digital converter box is probably from magnovox, it cost around 40 dollars, and if you go to dtv2009.org and get put on the waiting list for the coupon, you will only be paying taxes on the box.|`|d1439023e45a38bfcbe8a9c1fe40deafaa	it will only affect you if you use roof antenna or rabbit ears.  Cable or satelite will work just fine.  I heard RCA had the best box, but I was unable to get one,  so I would get the first one you can.  CVS had them on sale this week for $42.  and you get $40 off with a coupon.|`|2qkSYsdSaa	zenith. that is the best brand. that is what i got and it is great. do not get one that has a built in antenna cause it has bad reception and you cant add another antenna. the RCA are very cheap feeling and seem like they would break easy. hope this helps :-)|`|rY7TKWdsaa	mmore decsription pleas.e
tWoN22rRaa	D80  + Bigger and brighter Optical viewfinder  + In body motor allows it to autofocus with ALL AF lenses (not just AF-I and AF-S as with the D40/60)  + More direct access to the major settings of ISO, metering mode, shooting mode, autofocus mode, White Balance, and Quality.  + Can function as a wireless commander for all Nikon creative lighting equipped flashes.  + Two command dials instead of just one (which makes it easier to set the aperture and shutter speed independently while in manual mode).  + Top mounted passive LCD (consumes less power and is easier to read in daylight than the back LCD).  + Bracketing. (which means it can be set to automatically take a series of shots with slightly different exposure settings)  + Depth of Field preview.  + Optional wired remote (this allows unlimited use of the bulb mode, which is where the shutter remains open for as long as you want it to).|`|6584a2c112e4342d61a5a55cbb9aafd0aa	You're absolutely right, it's not about megapixels. One of the most significant differences between the D80 and the D40 is the D80 has the focus motor built in to the body, the D40 does not. This limits the D40 to AF-i and AF-s lenses, while the D80 will focus with any AF Nikon or 3rd party lens. The D80 also has 11 focus points to the D40s 3, better matrix metering, bracketing, works with wireless flash commander, etc.|`|HBNx77BBaa	I've only recently discovered Ken Rockwell  who is frequently referenced here for all things Nikon DSLR. He's a great fan of the D40 but regards the D80 as history. I can't add anything to the debate, but the conclusions at the end of his D90 review may be of interest, if you haven't seen this already...    http://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/d90.htm    Edit: Wow. Two thumbs down so far. Not everyone's a Ken Rockwell fan then. Or perhaps Canon owners are not allowed to speak on Nikon questions. I'm aware that I've given a D90 link but the D40 and D80 get a mention in the conclusion of the D90 review and there are links to both cameras from there.

N1CIndMOaa	Your camera records as MPEG4 AVC/H.264 or SD: MPEG2. The MPEG4 and the AVCHD won't work with Media Player unless you get an add-on for MediaPlayer.     It's better to get yourself editing software like Adobe Premiere Elements 7 or Sony's Vegas Movie Studio 9.

RyvKws7Laa	Stick with Pioneer (top dogs but cost a fortune), Panasonic (best of the affordable variety), or Samsung (gets very solid reviews) for Plasma.    Also, if you get a Plasma you have to condition the gasses.  For the first 100-200 hours of usage you need to crank the brightness/contrast way down.  After that you can optimize it and enjoy.    Plasma is better than LCD, despite what LCD fanboys might say.  LCDs are the everyman HDTV because they are cost effective.  They are good, just not great (unless you get a new LED LCD, but those cost more than Plasmas).    Good plasmas do not experience burn-in.  The good ones even have extra technology to help prevent such.  But the plasma technology itself is now better at avoiding it.    Plasmas do not die quickly.  The good plasmas can run for 24/7 for 34 years before dying.  How long exactly do you want to own the same TV?  You'll want an OLED long before it dies.    If you must go LCD stick with Samsung, Sharp Aquos, or Sony (if its on sale).  LCDs are good for bright rooms because they are a matte finish.  But they are bad at fast motion (sports/action movies).  Even the fancy 120Hz ones are still not anywhere at par with Plasma.|`|2qkSYsdSaa	NO they are not! I have heard from several people that they burn VERY quickly and that is sticks for up to three days. I heard that someone was watching a show and when it went to comerical there was the logo of the network (it was nbc) burned in the screen. it took fifteen minutes to burn an image into it. I hate the plasmas. but the lcds are good, caus i own one and love it. hope this helps :-)|`|IARQmZjVaa	Best Buy owns Dynex and has been in some trouble with the FCC for false advertising and misrepresentation.|`|1eXxGForaa	First off don't buy a plasma. They have burn in problems, the overall life is less, they get hot so the fans run loudly, its outdated technology. Buy an LCD TV. If you want a High end TV go with Toshiba, Sony, Vizio, Sharp, basically anything name band. If you want 50+ inches look at DLP TV's, if you want a cheap LCD look at Dynex, Sharp(from walmart), shop around online. Newegg.com is where i got my Toshiba 32". They have really good deals.
3CJAUyqPaa	Camera? Canon PowerShot 750. I've had it for a while. Any of the PowerShots, Sony CyberShots... any of the pocket cameras or even SLRs. Consider investing $7 in a memory card reader rather than direct-connecting the camera. Saves battery life of the camera. All connect using USB. The only place you might have issues might be with the video formats the DSCs and SLRs capture - just download and install StreamClip  apple.com/downloads/macosx/video/mpegs...  to convert the files for iMovie to use.  I have and use a G5 iMac, an older G4 PowerBook, a CoreDuo iMac and MackBook...|`|j5Apt8hWaa	Any digital camera will work with a Mac, but I am surprised you set your budget so low.  You spent quite a bit more to buy a Mac rather than a PC, but now you want to go cheap?  What's that all about?      Do yourself a favor and spend between $150 and $200 on a decent P&S camera.  To save money in the end, pick one that uses SD/SDHC memory cards.  Most of the P&S cameras use them (all but Sony -- Memory Stick and Olympus -- xD) and you can get more GB for the dollar when you need to buy a SD/SDHC memory card.    Most new Mac's include a card reader, so you will be ahead of the game there.    Look here for dependable and reputable P&S cameras.    http://www.dpreview.com
1c56d6640f8046a9cd43f450d0c344a0aa	If you want high definition movies are the best possible picture quality then yes you need one. If DVD's go obsolete then they will still play in your new Blu-ray player so that's not an issue.     When VHS came out did you say it would suck if DVDs took over? Blu-ray is even less of an issue because, unlike VHS, they are backwards compatible. So you will be able to play your existing library of DVDs while enjoying new movie purchases in HD.    Do you need one? No...    Might you want one? Yes!|`|8213dbb28238df28f026dac640239fb1aa	Blu-ray players can play DVDs.  Upscaled even.  So your DVDs aren't going to be obsolete.    Do you need a Blu-ray player?  No you don't need one.  Do you want one?  That's up to you.  With the right equipment they're better than DVDs.  You just need to decide if you think the price is worth what you're getting out of it.  Set a reasonable price limit and wait for them to drop.|`|48b7amuZaa	I JUST bought a Blu-Ray player.  If you have a hi def TV, Blu-Ray movies will look fantastic on it!  Even though Blu-Rays will probably become the standard (eventually), all current Blu-Ray players play standard DVD movies, and in most cases will upscale the video.  So your standard DVDs will actually look better (assuming a hi def TV).  I'd say, get one!|`|ojEIcUKyaa	If you have an HDTV and want the best quality out of it as possible, then blu-ray is definitely the way to go. Not only are the blu-ray titles themselves fantastic, but your current DVD's will also be upconverted as well. I've been working with Warner Home Video on some blu-ray projects and am completely hooked on the format.
rIwBCh03aa	if your laptop has an ethernet port then yes    you need to connect the laptop to the ps3 using a rj45 ethernet cable ( you might need a cross over cable as you dont have a hub but your laptop might autosense this )     you then need to configure your laptop to act as a router ( exactly how depends on the system but easy to do in xp or vista )|`|53sVKcOeaa	As long as your laptop has an ethernet port or wireless G internet and the 3G software allows you to connect other computers to it (most don't). You can do it, you just set the connection to share and plug the PS3 into the laptop via an ethernet cable making sure any firewalls are allowing the connections.

fdd5c5b5d35c694b40560fd4c8109e54aa	Probably next year... or maybe never with 2 reasonings... and never with iPhone unless it's a new iPhone that works on the new network    Since Virgin is on Bell mobility, Bell is upgrading their network to HSPA, 4G...     Virgin you could say is simply borrowing their network... When bell has their new network running they don't have to allow virgin in since bell will have 2 networks... But this theory is unlikely...     No phones have been designed yet for such new network for bell, probably Japanese phones but i doubt they'll be here... And they might be built in and have no simcards at all! but once again unlikely    Basically the network upgrade is just about speed...    The bell network isnt going to be GSM so iphone will never work unless apple makes a new type of iphone that supports the 4G LTE network (HSPA)
uctxzjIIaa	FF XIII is going to be a traditional Japanese RPG, featuring a female lead character currently known as Lightning.    FF Versus XIII takes place at least in the same universe, and perhaps on the same planet, but in different locations and has a totally separate plot (though they did say early on that events in one game's plot would have some sort of impact on the other game's plot. For an idea of what they might mean by this, imagine in one game, someone blows up a dam, and the other game occurs down-river, so there's suddenly flooding that has to be handled in that plot). FF Versus XIII is going to be an action RPG (think Kingdom Hearts or FF7: Dirge of Cerberus) with a much darker and sinister tone.    I really haven't heard any details on Agito.|`|JcrbDqf1aa	Different games, different characters. They might be all tied to eachother somehow, though.|`|1HtTxOOQaa	I don't know about agito but FFXIII as the above guy said has a different plot as compared to FF vs XIII.  All I know is that FFXIII comes out on both platforms(PS3 and 360) whereas FF vs XIII is a PS3 exclusive.  Personally I am awaiting FF vs XIII cause it has a darker story compared to FFXIII and I feel that the graphics of FF vs XIII will also be better as it's a PS3 exclusive.  But anyways, I will probably play both games.|`|mPaqhgUuaa	They all have different plots and characters.    FF XII - The original FF rpg, except with really good graphics and faster combat system    FF XII vs - A more action based FF. I recommend this one.    FF Agito - From what I heard, this is a PSP game.
