Bill Richardson withdrew because a grand jury is investigating the way he issued state contracts to political donors.    Obama promised us "change."   Maybe the "change" is a new world record for nominating crooks.  His approval rating is headed down....fast.  Wow, those Chicago politicians are great aren't they.  Maybe Obama can find a place in his cabinet for FORMER Gov. Blago.    Can't wait for tomorrows news!

I am sick of this loser acting like what Imus did was so bad, south park hit the nail on the head with the ****** episode. Whatever happened to freedom of speech in this country. Al sharpton is only a spokesperson for racist black people, there is a big difference between civil rights activists and racists. Al Sharpton and NAACP is just equally as bad as the KKK. Im sick of whites taking all this slack. If there was a united caucasian college fund, it would be called racist and taken down, unlike the united ***** college fund, im sick of it, if were all equal, then why are whites getting all the slack? being called racists for going against Al Sharptons beliefs?

20090225012405AA4IQPK	News & Events;Current Events	Is Obama a habitual liar?	In his address last night, he said he would not allow any earmarks, no excess spending yet as Congress prepares to unveil a $410 billion omnibus spending bill that's riddled with thousands of earmarks, despite his calls for restraint and efforts on Capitol Hill to curtail the practice.       The bill will contain about 9,000 earmarks totaling $5 billion, congressional officials say. Many of the earmarks — loosely defined as local projects inserted by members of Congress — were inserted last year as the spending bills worked their way through various committees.       This is the typical lies you here from politicians, but his man is lying right into the camera on national tv. Pitiful.

20090225022026AAYJy7o	News & Events;Current Events	Pilipinos or may not WHAT IS YOUR REACTION?	Effects of global crisis prompt Manila to cut its growth goals      MANILA, Philippines - The Philippines’ economic managers reduced growth targets for this year, recognizing severe effects of the global slowdown that has cut export demand and may slash remittances from overseas Filipino workers.       The Philippine economy may only grow within a range of 3.7 to 4.4 percent, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ralph G. Recto said during a presentation he delivered at an economic briefing.       The government previously set this year’s growth goals at 3.7 percent to 4.7 percent.       Last year, the Philippine economy expanded by 4.6 percent, a far cry from 2007’s 7.1 percent, it’s highest in three decades.       The country's gross national product (GNP), which includes income from overseas, is expected to expand by anywhere from 4.2 percent to 4.9 percent. Last year, GNP expanded by 6.1 percent.      Agriculture, which makes up about a fifth of the economy and grew 3.2 percent last year, is expected to improve by three percent to 3.6 percent.      With falling exports, the industry sector is seen to post slower growth to 3.9 percent to 4.7 percent from last year’s five percent.      Services are also seen to take a hit as its growth forecast is between 3.8 percent and 4.5 percent from last year’s 4.9 percent.
