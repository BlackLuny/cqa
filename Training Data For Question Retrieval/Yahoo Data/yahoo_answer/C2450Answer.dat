dQmFoRRiaa	A lovely poem that commemorates the defeat of the Spanish Armada under Medina Sidonia by the English fleet (under Admiral Lord Howard) in May 1588.  You seem to be in possession of a historical misconception in saying 'My people will soon be free.'  The point of the battle was to thwart Phillip II's desire to return England to Catholicism.  That being said, your poem was well-constructed and I enjoyed it.  Read more about this passage in history; it's fascinating... As for Becky B young lady, honor thy father and thy mother (and the rest of us too, but mainly yourself).|`|WWXDOsPpaa	oh geez... that's nice.... stop watching movies? Anyways I haven't seen it but I think this is a really nice poem, it doesn't bore me to death. Most people write page long poems on this kind of stuff... good job!|`|EqfWi7Ohaa	stop watching movies|`|MBa3xMcWaa	awesome!! i like it!!! <br>  one small suggestion: dont worry abt the rhyme scheme..you did a good job !|`|WbRuTjmFaa	Very nicely done<br>  I think you have the aptitude to  go very far with your poetry. <br>  <br>  I am not a History buff. It bored me to tears as a child. I find now that it was not the subject matter it was the way it was directed to me.. I found other things far moree interesting..
zCHnMeXbaa	before the decision and since the time of the Declaration of Independence five of the original 13 colonies allowed black men to vote as free men--they were citizens of the U.S.   The Scott decision reversed all of that. The Supreme Court ruled that any slave or any descendant of a slave had no rights to citizenship or even the right to sue if presently a slave.  The decision also voided the Missouri Compromise which prohibited slavery north of the 36 degree 30 minute parallel (latitude) within the Louisiana Purchase.  In  effect, any states formed in the Purchase territory could decide to legalize slavery.|`|K2WwTNJyaa	It didn't. All it did was state that since he wasn't a US citizen, since he was a slave, he had no rights and therefore couldn't sue. This was one factors that helped to lay the groundwork for the Civil War, but as far as reversing Congress, it didn't.
Viec3YH9aa	hi, had written a good answer and was delted, so just a quick one.<br>  <br>  The large majority of the world are against the settlements, and there are often Resulotions passed in the UN condeming the building on them.<br>  It is illegal under International Law.

ZB9zkbxxaa	In Paris Karl Marx met Friedrich Engels, who would become his lifelong collaborator. Expelled from France in 1845, he moved to Brussels, where his political orientation matured and he and Engels made names for themselves through their writings. Marx was invited to join a secret left-wing group in London, for which he and Engels wrote the Communist Manifesto (1848). <br>  <br>  They stuck together for most of their life and even wrote a book together<br>  <br>  So,its obvious ain't it, they did share the same ideas<br>  <br>  Hope I helped<br>  <br>  Cheers!<br>  <br>  Rohan ;)
ac0d4c45bf78507770b21657ff6f8f59aa	You've done well with the story, even brandishing the many popular brands of the day. Your last sentence explained well the reason for the brands and the detailed appearance of the girl.<br>  <br>  My first impression at reading the ending was, "Oh, my goodness! She got me!"<br>  <br>  I'd venture to guess that this story was written by a teenage girl. Now what you must do is get rid of the word 'gotta' and you'll be the better for it.|`|h3t4Uewvaa	i like it, cant really suggest anything else (:|`|J8xRVPulaa	I found it kind of predictable, but still enjoyed reading it. :D<br>  I think you just need to work on you sentence structure, paragraphs and generally clean it up a bit and make it more read-able.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, thumbs up!|`|oalrUO4yaa	i thought it was very well written.<br>  but is she going to come to life? because if she isn't then you don't really have much to work with...<br>  but yeah, i would definately continue writing this. i thought it was great.

8qiAcwSGaa	try ballet for around 2-3 years then talk to your teacher|`|WIpeC3gRaa	Every studio, person, and teacher is different. I've seen a few different ideas but the most common are<br>  -3 years of advanced ballet training<br>  -11+ years old<br>  -The ankle muscles are developed strongly and can hold the body weight.<br>  Here's a link that might hep you more than I can:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointe#Preparing_for_pointe" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointe#Prep...</a>|`|ggulJWddaa	Yeah, have a chat with you dance teacher. She's the best person to ask, because she knows you and knows if you're ready or not.<br>  It really does depend on how strong your feet and ankles are.<br>  It's essential that you don't start too early, as this often leads to painful injuries.<br>  Ask your teacher for a totally honest answer - and if she says your not ready, find out from her what you need to do to get your first pair of pointes.<br>  :)|`|nWbuG6fyaa	it all depends on your ankle strength, not just your foot strength. you need to have strong ankles to support your weight. <br>  <br>  also: your teacher might tell you no. if you have only done ballet for 1 year, then you might not have the technique. you need to have down the basics and be wrking on more advanced stuff in order to be good on pointe. there is a difference between on pointe, and good on pointe.|`|8dlxCanCaa	I would ask your teacher. It varries between person to person. Someone can be dancing for 8 years and someone who has been dancing for 2 yeats can be just as good as them. Ask your teacher and start doing a lot of releves to help strenghten your ankles. Go on youtube and search "Lisa Howell". She has amazing videos about strenghtening different muscles before you go en pointe and she also has basic stretching videos for when you do go en pointe. Good luck!!<br>  =]|`|K4bJgTF4aa	your teacher should tell you when you are ready.  but talk to her.  your ankles need to be strong.|`|gZDaxeU6aa	It would definitely be a great thing to talk with your dance teacher first.But I started studying ballet when I was 10 and my ballet teacher put me on pointe 3 years after.<br>  <br>  Good Luck;}!|`|foZ2lVItaa	depends on how long you've been dancing and when your teacher says you're ready.|`|c9M1gcPGaa	it took me about 3 years ...but ur teacher is the best to decide if you ready or not !!!<br>               Good luck ~~~
CkLwurWUaa	I read all of the answers. The one about disney channel making commercials, is FALSE. That commercial is for an agency called John Robert Powers which is a scam. It makes you pay like $2,000 and then they don't give you any auditions. If you want to be on DC, you'll need an agent. You can find Agencies in your state online if you want. And agents are the ONLY way to find DC auditions. Not websites or anything. Those are scams.|`|w4se3jAKaa	Sometimes, you have to work your way up to Disney. Start by auditioning for things like Kidz Bop, if you can sing. Also audition for plays first. My friend was in a play, and a talent agent saw her. She got to be in 3 commercials after that. Good luck!|`|59OfAFvTaa	my friends little sister is auditioning for icarly but thats not disney its nick. if there is though disney will have comercial with a website or phone number to call. so watch for those comercials

fkwYvFBRaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing – at affordable costs. <br>  <br>  Try which company suits you and start from there.|`|nE5eqyWeaa	Lulu and Publish America are good print on demand type places. If you're not actively submitting your work yet, you're probably not ready to seek a book publisher unless you just want a book for friends and family.|`|Rm9mII46aa	Have you had any of the poems in this book published in magazines? If so, then the next step is to send it to publishers - there are tons, just google "poetry book publishers" or something, then call them or email them and ask what you should do with your manuscript.<br>  <br>  If you haven't had any poems published, then you're gonna have a tough go of it. Maybe try sending out individual poems for publication in magazines first. Most books of poetry have at least half of their material published in magazines/anthologies before they're in the book. <br>  <br>  Or you could publish it yourself. Just google "self-publishing" or something, and go from there.
AA10729271	Well, you can probably find a decent second hand clarinet for around 200, but i wouldn't go through ebay, instruments are really something you need to examine in person, try looking at local music stores, most carry a stock of second hand instruments.<br>  <br>  For a clarinet, check for things like this; make sure the keys open and close and are not sticky, that the clarinet comes and is taken apart easily, and that the cork seals are not old or brittle.<br>  <br>  Clarinets are kind of an overlooked instrument, they are a lot more adaptable than a flute and you can play classic, or jazz, or blues. I played for about 6 years in highschool and still practise.|`|577076a28e3180e6d74e269d0d346d57aa	Harmonica.<br>  <br>  It is fun... I recommend a Hohner Marine Band C Harmonica.<br>  <br>  You could also pick up a cheap Mexiconn Shooting Star Saxophone. Nice quality saxs on the cheap.<br>  <br>  A cool Koa Uke would also be fun.

They only heard rumors of Boo, so he's practically a stranger to them. And since they don't know him they think he's weird, or strange.|`|uP9SQhkcaa	Wow, lots of TKM questions today. (:
vBid6hbbaa	I interpreted it as after Gemma's mother died, she was for a while present in the realms.  Eventually though she moved on and Circe went with the opportunity to manipulate Gemma by posing as her mother at the end.  I'm not sure if that's what Libba Bray intended, but that's what I figure.

Your line weight defines your gothic art style. The messy line weight quality goes well with the art style. My constructive criticism though is your line weight is ALL OVER THE PLACE. My opinion is you can keep the messy line work (I actually like it), but I think you should keep it constant. I also noticed how you don't like to draw hands too much. Drawing poses can and usually is far more dynamic when you're able to see their hands. I suggest you look at your own hand for reference and practice drawing your hands. You have the right idea with perspective when it comes to foreshortening, but the closer the object is supposed to look, the line weight should be heavier.<br>  <br>  Overall Rating - 5.5; It has potential, pursue that!!<br>  <br>  I think you should continue drawing and practice, regardless of what others say. If drawing makes you feel good, do it.|`|gL8bN0eqaa	yes you should continue drawing.  you have nice potential :3  I won't give you a rating sorry but, you have a long way to go till your great. but i bet your great for your age and how long you've been drawing though~<br>  real advice: <a href="http://endling.deviantart.com/journal/23152642/" rel="nofollow">http://endling.deviantart.com/journal/23...</a><br>  its awesome and should help you out definitely.
draNVjbkaa	Some of the best schools in NYC:<br>  -Margie Haber Studios (based in LA but teaches in NY. Best cold reading class)<br>  -William Esper Studios<br>  -HB Studios<br>  -TVI Studios<br>  -Second City<br>  -Groundlings<br>  -Weist Barron Hill<br>  <br>  Avoid John Robert Powers, John Casablancas, and Barbizon!<br>  <br>  John Robert Powers, John Casablancas, and Barbizon are all SCAMS! They are NOT agencies! They MISLEAD people into thinking that they are, but are NOT. LEGIT Agencies only make money when you do (10% for film/tv and commercials, 20% for commercial print). REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period! When you get picked up by a LEGIT agency like Ford or Elite, they will teach you or hire coaches. They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC still exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises. For every 100 people that go through these scammy schools and lose their money, there will always be that naturally talented kid that gets work and that these scammy schools take credit for. <br>  <br>  JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent. They say that Lucille Ball, John Wayne, Barbara Walters, Heather Locklear, Peter Fonda, Jane Fonda, and many other famous actors went to the school, when NONE of them did! Some of those celebs even threatened legal action for using their names. So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.<br>  <br>  Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s. Now these franchises have been known for unethical business practices and false promises.<br>  <br>  These schools are OVERPRICED and DON'T provide the caliber training that more affordable and REPUTABLE schools like Howard Fine Studios, Ivanna Chubbuck, TVI Studios, Groundlings, Second City, Beverly Hills Playhouse, Stella Adler, William Esper Studios, Tom Todoroff, Joanne Baron/D.W. Brown, Margie Haber, etc. do.<br>  <br>  Go look those schools up! They are all respected by the industry and LEGIT!|`|EeabLB5eaa	I also live on LI and so dose my cousion.

wODTbUEhaa	I was nominated too! Mine was for medicine, I just got it in the mail yesterday. Its a good program, I asked my teachers about it and only the top 1% of high scoring high school students get nominated, and they DO have scholarships, but i have no idea how you're supposed to get them. Im gonna try to go to the one in Los Angeles, so maybe we'll meet up! haha but just read through the papers a few times, look at the sight, and ask teachers and people about it. A few kids from my school got nominated ( only 2 lol ) so the teachers know a little about the program. Its been around since 1993 and I did a little research. Not everyone that takes tests is nominated for this either, because I took something that had nothing to do with this, but I guess I checked a box that said let colleges & other programs see my scores ( which im really glad I did, because at first I was thinking that I didnt want to check the box ) so I guess thats how you get nominated. I dont know if there's a specific test for this though.<br>  But I also dont know if the tests you take that get you nominated depend on your grade.. Im in 9th grade and the only test I can remember taking is something called the EXPLORE test, and I guess they got my scores from there. <br>  <br>  But its a lot of money for 10 days.. My mom is in nursing, so she REALLY wants me to do this lol. So if you have the money, you should really do it. It would look good on college things and for jobs too. <br>  <br>  Sooo, all that stuff I just said basically means = GO!

YrxJuStaaa	I would agree that Jane and Frank's marriage is a foil to some extent. Jane is a foil to Emma and Frank is a foil to Mr. Knightley, so this would make the marriages foils to each other. But I think the main purpose of their marriage is to reveal Frank's true character, through which Emma learns about her errors in judging both of their characters.<br>  Austen is commenting on the strictness of the social codes in regard to marriage. Social status has a huge effect on marriage, because Frank must keep his marriage a secret from his aunt due to Jane's lower class origins. Emma and Mr. Knightley, on the other hand, are a perfect match because their personalities are similar, as is their social standing.|`|KdxyjD5Oaa	I think it just emphasizes Emma's arrogance when she was convinced that he was in love with her but was engaged to JF all along. Also her unsuccessful go at matchmaking.<br>  I don't think she uses it to foil against the marriage between Emma and Mr.K. Rather the opposite because it's when she vows to not meddle with peoples lives and concentrates on herself that she finds that she loves Mr.K. <br>  The whole book is based on marriage and match-making. So it adds an unlikely matching and provides a twist because we don't suspect them to be romantically linked due to their behaviour at the social parties!<br>  Hope it's helped!

TYV6vBAxaa	1) the idea? Um...well i don't know! i was sitting in science class and it suddenly came to me! xD science class inspiration... lolz<br>  2)YEA! i write almost every single day.<br>  3)Yes, because the main character is portrayed as me- as a klutz xD<br>  4) EVERYDAY! it was so annoying because i would have the best idea for a chapter or some part of the story on the tip of my tongue and then i would forget it as soon as i grabbed a pen/paper!<br>  5)Sometimes focused, almost always distracted<br>  6) Well no, not really at all but i would ask all my friends to read the story and of course they would go its good! but they had to say that! sometimes i thought my favorite parts of the story, would be the fav. part for everyone else but it wasn't! i mean they always liked the parts tht i hated!<br>  7)Yea, the first name never matched with the last name and the descriptions and personalities of the characters were so hard to come up with! i mean i didn't want the characters to have the same color hair and stuff! it was so frustrating! <br>  8) I always read stories that were fiction while i was growing u, and the idea of the story seemed idk fiction?|`|3cWnasQ2aa	1. a dream (i know 'like stephanie') but it was so cool and really vivd and its not about vampires though the characters do have superpowers<br>  2. i write all the time not very-well though i'm working on like 14 books all with different plots and characters<br>  3. my character Sophie is like me in that her hair and eyes reflect mine and she can be moody and Bethany is like the level-headed me<br>  4. all the time but it goes away easily<br>  5. always distracted (i usually write during class)<br>  6. no not at all<br>  7. not with characters personalities but with names yes<br>  8. i dont really get genres i kind of just write what fits the story|`|k8LrtCzcaa	It depends on the person and the book- I wouldn't know, I've never written a book.|`|VjUqAZuUaa	Just for people who've written a story?

Assuming I've now got your go-ahead for this answer, okay:<br>  <br>  1) Breaking open a fortune cookie on a coach on the way back from a museum. The story now has nothing to do with fortune cookies =)<br>  2) Yes, but I never finish my stories usually. I get bogged down in description and never really know how to finish in a non-lame way.<br>  3) Yes, my main character is quite introverted and emotional like me.<br>  4) All the time. To counteract it, I start to write a stream-of-consciousness piece to get the creative juices flowing.<br>  5) When I get into writing, I can write for ages but I am a very easily distracted person and the likes of Facebook, Youtube and Yahoo Answers are very tempting.<br>  6) No. I imagined it always but never believed it.<br>  7) Yeah, a little. Not so much the personalities but I felt the names had to be special, you know? The right names to fit the person.<br>  8) I write what I enjoy writing. I write because it pleases me.<br>  <br>  Hope this is the kind of thing you're looking for! =)|`|el0ry6nXaa	1. It's a mixture of my life, my experiences, people I know, and a show called gilmore girls. =D<br>  2. Yes, I've been writing creatively since 2nd grade.<br>  3. The main character Aly is a rough sketch of myself. She does a lot of the same things, but is not an exact parallel. <br>  4. All of the time. I can't ever write unless I get inspired, and sometimes it takes weeks to get inspired.<br>  5. I guess you could say I got distracted sometimes, but I stayed as focused as I always am.<br>  7. At first I did. I looked in the phone book to help me out with the names and I used people I know for personalties.<br>  8. I didn't really pick a genre. I just wrote what I wanted to write.

Inside they find an old race car.  While they are looking it over they are discovered by and old man who tells them all about the car and his "glory days" and his dream of having a son to pass the car on to.  <br>  <br>  However, his wife, the love of his life, died during child birth.  Since then he has been spending all of his avoiding the world.  <br>  <br>  <br>  The boys help him to fix up the car and while doing so, they build a friendship.

Fall asleep, wake up and find yourself in the video game, driving a race car through obstacles (think of some things that would happen in a game). Your car runs out of gas, so you are forced to abandon it. You walk along a deserted road and a tour bus comes along to pick you up. Its your favorite band/singer! They invite you to come on the bus and you end up going on tour with them overseas to Tokyo and France.

HUDjXVOyaa	Vienna is an amazing place. I've only read about it and the many famous artist who came from there. I image there isn't another place on Earth like it. <br>  <br>  How long are you going to be studying there? <br>  <br>  I have no idea how much it will cost you, but what I can suggest to you is to look at Art Grants. I know they're grants available for artists for the purpose of travel. They are often offered by local, regional, and even national art organizations or art councils. The larger the council, the greater sum of money can be given. Tip-Alway apply for the full amount. <br>  Art organizations exist for the purpose of helping artists achieve projects, including travel to study. Joining a membership with there organization will increase your odds of receiving monies, but it isn't necessary. I joined a local council for only $35 and it has been worth while because of discounts on art supplies and printing costs, at local businesses.  <br>  <br>  Oh,...Look into churches and Charities too. Even if you aren't spiritual, Churches are a great source of kindness. Exchange a spiritual themed painting for stay at a hostel or for free food. I imagine there is a lot of history reguarding churches and spirituality in Vienna too.   <br>  <br>  Well, it was nice talking,...All the best.

7KcVSB3Uaa	You might be big, but it takes all sorts to make the world work. A year isn't just one season, it's all of them, both the cold and the hot. The sphere refers to the world. And I might not be as big as you, but I can maneuver well, and I'm fast; you have to sit in one place all the time.<br>  <br>  Basically, the theme of the poem is that it takes all kinds.

C77c0OE2aa	Do you realize that the film has to first be processed? You cannot scan the film right out of the camera. The processing, (developing), of the film is what creates the negative image on the film.<br>  <br>  This is hardly the place to teach you how to process film yourself.<br>  <br>  Most any place where you take or send the film can also do scans of the negatives at time of processing. This is FAR, FAR, FAR easier than trying to do this yourself. There are various levels of scan quality, and many scans at process will be at very low resolution, suitable for not much more than email or 4 x 6 prints. You will need a high resolution scan done of the entire roll at time of processing to have large, quality files for prints. Here is one place that does this at low cost.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.northcoastphoto.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.northcoastphoto.com/</a><br>  <br>  Click at the top where is says, "interested in the scanning services..."<br>  <br>  Now if you want to do the scans of the negatives yourself, yes, you can.... but.... it will cost you the price of a good negative capable scanner. The Nikon Coolscan 5000 is the best home unit for 35mm, but costs about $1500. You can get flatbed scanners that will do a half way decent job, such as the Epson v750, but even this is a few hundred dollars. Then there is the learning curve. Scanning negatives is something of an art, requiring good knowledge of color correction and use of ICE dust removal. Wet mounting the negatives in glass plates is the best method. <br>  <br>  The very best scan is a drum scan. Many labs are not even equipped to do this, and those who do it charge about $50 per negative. <br>  <br>  Hope that gives you some insight into this. There is no such thing as a "step by step tutorial" on this, as it is completely different depending on what film is used, scanner used, resolution used, and software used.<br>  <br>  steve|`|2TLXfQKDaa	I'm not sure about pulling it out of the roll, but I have a buddy that uses something like this after he gets his film developed at the grocery store.<br>  <br>  There are various versions of these devices that will give you a range on resolution, but they're pretty self explanatory and are used by many people that don't really want to scan the processed photo.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.superphonestore.net/ion-slide2pc.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.superphonestore.net/ion-slide...</a>|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	I don't know how much experience you have with photography or how much you know about film photography.  But you can't just take the film out of the camera and scan it.  The film has to be developed first.  When you take pictures with a film camera, the film captures what's called a "latent image."  There is an image, but it has to be developed with chemicals in order to make the image visible and permanent.  So you first have to take the film to a photo lab to have it developed.  (Or, if it's a black and white film, you can actually develop it yourself at home if you bought the chemicals and supplies.  It's not that hard to do).<br>  <br>  If you were to just take a roll of film out of the camera, you wouldn't see anything.  The film would look exactly the same.  The latent images are invisible.  And you would ruin the film and destroy the images if you expose it to light.  You have to chemically develop the film first.  <br>  <br>  Once the film is developed, you will need a special "film scanner."  You can't just put the negatives on a regular flatbed scanner.  Some flatbed scanners have an adaptor to scan negatives and slides, but otherwise you'll need a dedicated film scanner.  Once you scan the negatives, you can use image editing software to reverse the negatives into positive images, and then make any other minor corrections that you might need to do...such as adjusting the color balance and saturation, contrast, etc.|`|R3UVYaHtaa	ok, after developing your film just but it in your scanner and scan it in high resolution. i mean each photo. save them, then use any good editing program like Corel PSP or Adobe Photoshop and use the negative functionality to negative the negative photos you saved. its done. good luck.

KJMEomouaa	I kinda get what your saying...and I think it's because we live our lives at such a fast pace we rarely stop to think and appreciate who we really are..<br>  <br>  I spent some time travelling through Morocco recently, and whilst there was a lot of poverty I think their pace of life is so much healthier..<br>  <br>  I began to breathe again, realise what truely is important - and then all of a sudden it's like i'm torn back to the 9-5 routine, and false faces....living by someone elses rules/guidlines...having to conform..<br>  <br>  We know what we should be...it's there deep down in our soul...& once had a taste of it, its hard to settle into the mundane again..but you can use the 'mundane' to get back out to your ancestors again...|`|pXPdO2I8aa	I believe that when we research our history ,we begin to live in that era in our mind and imagine ourselves in that time warp.<br>  Everything which we discover about our ancestors is so much more exciting than our mundane present-day life that we don't wish to return to here and now!|`|0oCVN8zKaa	what do you mean you found your tribe?|`|BKyFxjeBaa	you found HOME, you're entire world is changed now.<br>  Relax, and KNOW it's always been there, always will be.<br>  Go on with your life in that 'safety'.<br>  They'll be there when you fall down, sure they'll laugh at you while they pick you up.

dQmFoRRiaa	The eagle as symbol of American freedom and might is a natural choice, and you have certainly extended that metaphor in a most telling manner.  Your middle stanza of free verse points to the fact that our national predicament is a matter of both choices poorly made -- 'feasts / On carrion foul' -- and perhaps happenstance, as in your allusion to woeful foreign policy decisions such as the Iraq debacle -- 'a field's unseen muck and mire' -- a line which exploits its 'length' to add some lovely ornaments in assonance and alliteration.  In your concluding stanza, the disabled, disgraced, and defaced seem an unholy triumvirate connected not only in sense but in sound.  That being said, your meter seems a bit off in places; surely in S1 L3 freedom is trochaic, non?  You have similar metrical deviations in many of the remaining lines, and in a couple of cases a simple rhetorical inversion would have solved the matter? I can only wonder why you did not pursue such avenues.  All in all though, a fine Dorsimbra that seems to these old ears to have sacrificed some of its aural textures and potential in the making of meaning; in that sensibility, I salute you.|`|dS3XHvaoaa	I agree...

We know there will be a Hogwarts castle, Hogsmeade, and Forbidden Forest, and they're running polls on the official website about where visitors would most like to eat (The Three Broomsticks, The Hog's Head, or The Leaky Cauldron) and shop (Zonko's Joke Shop, Honeydukes, or Ollivanders). They also asked about voters' favorite broomstick (Nimbus Two Thousand, Firebolt, or Nimbus Two Thousand and One) and drink (Butterbeer or Pumpkin Juice). We can assume, therefore, that some of these shops will exist in the theme park. As for rides, I don't know, but I think it would be reasonable to assume some sort of broomstick ride.|`|COg8rZnJaa	I definitely know that Hagrid's Hut is going to be there but it's not a ride it is going to be used as just a prop.

AA11712689	One of the main reasons was the Cotton Trade.<br>  <br>  Southern planters were becoming filthy rich on the trade of cotton, and other products like lumbers, pine by-products, rice, believe it or not, and such.<br>  <br>  The Agricultural South really was quite far removed from the hussle and bussle of the Industrial North. Life really was different. <br>  <br>  The South realized that they alone could grow their crops, get their crops to the coast, whether it was the Gulf Coast or the Southeastern coast, trade with whomever they wanted to for the best price, plenty of Spanish and French merchant seamen around, along with Dutch and especially British.<br>  <br>  And they did need any help from the Industrilized North.<br>  Nor were they into giving the Industrilized North and HELP either.<br>  <br>  Southern planters were getting TOP dollar for cotton.<br>  A price the North business men were NOT willing to pay.<br>  <br>  Cotton was a HUGE hit in Europe.<br>  Sure, Europe had had Egyptian cotton forever BUT there is a HUGE difference between Egyptian Cotton and America Cotton.<br>  Before the "discovery" of the Americas, cotton was like SILK to Europeans...a fine fabric, only the rich could afford.<br>  Egytpian Cotton is hard to grow, doesn't grow much, doesn't grow but only a few places, and its cultivating was always kept pretty much secret like the making of silk was. Corner of the market type stuff.<br>  <br>  Then they come to the Americas and natives were sitting in the dirt wearing cotton lioncloths!<br>  Cotton was everywhere! Grew wild! Big fat fluffy cotton!<br>  (Europeans had been wearing wool underwear before that, imagine if you will).<br>  <br>  A Southerner could become as rich as a king with the cotton trade alone.<br>  <br>  While cotton mills, fabric makers, thread mills, tailoring mills...... sitting up in the Industrilized North .... EMPTY. <br>  <br>  All unable to afford the outragous prices of cotton grown in their OWN country by their OWN country men.<br>  <br>  Northern businessmen began to loudly demand to the government the need for control of exports/imports, taxes on exports, regulations on national products, assurance of American products going to American businesses, etc.<br>  <br>  For the American Government to do that, they had to "infrige" upon individual States Rights, which became Individual Rights, telling them what they could or could not do with their own laws and products.<br>  <br>  It was a States Rights over National Rights issue that began with .... cotton.<br>  <br>  However, this was not enough to gain favor to the Northern businessmen's cause.<br>  They needed something esle that would grab the attention of EVERYONE.<br>  That is why they added the slavery issue ...... <br>  Slavery was bad.<br>  Southern planters HAD to have a work force to produce this HUGE labor intensive crop, there were no where near the (white) people to produce this kind of crop, so Southern planter PURCHASED the labor in the ways of slaves.<br>  The more slaves they purchased, the much larger the crop, the more money they could get from it from OUTSIDE (non-American) sources, the richer they got, the richer they got, the more powerful they got.<br>  <br>  So, the Northern businessmen made slavery the issue to hide their greedy agenda against the South's greedy agenda of making all that powerful money for themselves.<br>  <br>  The South honestly thought that with England being it's BEST cotton customer, that England would assist the South in their little "argument" with the North. They almost did, but the Queen decided to let us fight amongst ourselves and see what happens.<br>  <br>  It all really WAS about White Americas greed, both North and South at any cost but.....<br>  <br>  The reasons of State/Individual Rights as opposed to the Rights of Big Government was easily a GOOD reason for the South to secede.<br>  <br>  State/Individual Rights as opposed to the Rights of Big Government is still an issue today.|`|7o4iiAAaaa	They were defending their own land and they didn't like that President Lincoln was going to make them get rid of slavery.

Rowling wrote it because she wanted to, not to make money. So, you have to WANT to write what you're writing, even if the emotion isn't exactly there. I mean, it would be more convincing to write about a bad break-up if you've experienced it, but even if you've never had one, it doesn't mean that you can't; Yes, some people may write for money and fame, but the only thing that matters is what you're writing about. You can't do something that you don't love. And if you want to be famous, and rich, and you have talent it's something that you'd most likely want to make a profit out of. You can still so something you love but make money off of it. If you enjoy your own writing, why not share it with the rest of the world?<br>  Hope it helps!<br>  Sorry if I repeated myself! :P|`|7xestOKUaa	Yes, yes, yes.<br>  I only write for myself, and a few close friends, because there is really not a chance of ever getting published, let alone being popular. There should definitely be more of a motivation behind writing than just getting paid for it. It should be about something you love, or want to explore. I think that if someone is going to write a book, it should be purely for fun. then if they decide to get it published, and it's popular, more power to them.|`|x08oohwpaa	I'm writing a book for myself.  I just want to prove to myself I can do it.  I'm only about halfway through, I've been working on it forever.  I really just want to finish it.

I do fantasize about getting published but that isn't my goal, I don't believe it would actually happen but I keep writing anyway.<br>  <br>  People who think its easy to get published and make money off writing are naive.  :-)|`|Iwk92vqyaa	*sorry this got so long...*<br>  <br>  Long ago and far away (bit of a joke, in some ways true), I was a staff reporter who definitely wrote for my paycheck and had to meet deadlines on breaking news; but I also wrote pieces for the paper that were 'opinion' and did a lot of fun interviews, plus regular reviews of books/plays/movies. But I did it for the money, though I considered almost all of it to be good fun and enjoyable.<br>  At the same time I wrote for myself, work I Really enjoyed writing, just to write. Some sci-fi, fantasy, some straight fiction (all short); had a base-line for an agent to see, got many of those pieces published, also for money, in the days when lit magazines were everywhere. Wrote some truly awful poetry that also got published. [Embarrassing.] <br>  <br>  Wrote a few plays to improve my skills at dialogue. One I sent to an acting troupe I knew, telling 'em "just practice with it, if you want to." <br>  They produced it. They had a great director who had a degree in theatre-directing from Germany. When I finally saw the play, I saw exactly what I'd pictured when writing it. <br>  It was a success and brought in more money than I'd ever imagined a play like that could. Surprised me considerably. No other play was ever deemed 'very good.' <br>  I DID spend six months of research for the play that was produced. <br>  Research on all kinds of topics often leads to success.<br>  <br>  Now I am working on a biography of a truly amazing elderly woman I know, but have started it over. Had been trying to use a dialect I'd never heard in my life, which does NOT work. The woman wants to see a book before she 'goes on' but that now seems doubtful. Am writing it to now please myself, to enjoy her life the way she told it to me; not the way she'd like to see it published. <br>  So, yeah, have done lots of writing just for enjoyment.<br>  <br>  I agree that writing anything (barring being a reporter, and even then if you like your job [I did], it's ALL fun) requires enjoying the writing.<br>  Have also worked as editor and tutor and have frequently told others what to really expect in regards publication, and how to have fun with what they write. <br>  It really is an essential part of putting out a good product. Rowling started writing just for her own enjoyment and her first books reflect that very well. The latter ones get a bit too involved with her knowledge of the stars, movies to come, and the studio.|`|tL73W0VZaa	I write for myself, because I love it, and I can't imagine life without writing. However, publishing is nothing to sneeze at. After all, if you can't make a living off writing, that means that you have to go out and do something else seven hours a day. If you are published and earning a living off your writing, you can stay home and write, rather than worrying about another job. No one should write solely to get published- it probably won't be any good anyway- but there's no need to hide your writing away. <br>  <br>  A major part of writing is having it read, and you can't write if you are working as a waitress 24 hours a day.|`|ucTkqSiAaa	Well I sure write for myself.

(Jane Austen, Emma)<br>  <br>  "To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of twenty-six and eighteen is to do pretty well; and professing myself moreover convinced that the general's unjust interference, so far from being really injurious to their felicity, was perhaps rather conducive to it, by improving their knowledge of each other, and adding strength to their attachment, I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may concern, whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend parental tyranny, or reward filial disobedience." (Jane Austen, Northanger Abbey)<br>  <br>  "He sprang from the cabin window as he said this, upon the ice raft which lay close to the vessel. He was soon borne away by the waves and lost in darkness and distance. (Mary Shelley, Frankenstein)<br>  <br>  "And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One! (Charles Dickens, A Christmas Carol)<br>  <br>  "Oh, my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this!" (Louisa May Alcott, Little Women)<br>  <br>  "My Master," he says, "has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'" (Charlotte Bronte, Jane Eyre - This one tells you that St. John Rivers is going to die but is content as he never had been before.)<br>  <br>  "I lingered round them, under that benign sky: watched the moths fluttering among the heath and harebells, listened to the soft wind breathing through the grass, and wondered how any one could ever imagine unquiet slumbers for the sleepers in that quiet earth." (Emily Bronte, Wuthering Heights)<br>  <br>  "And the ashes blew towards us with the salt wind from the sea." (Daphne du Maurier, Rebecca)<br>  <br>  "In the shining ball room the music rose and fell and swelled again into ecstasy as he took her white young lightness in his arm and they swayed and darted and swooped like things of the air--while the old Duchess and Lord Coombe looked on almost unseeing and talked in murmurs of Sarajevo." (Frances Hodgson Burnett, The Head of the House of Coombe; This, as I recall, was the eve of World War I, so the imagery is what makes this last line memorable to me - the beauty of the dancers juxtaposed with the ugliness of the war which was coming.)|`|u0zEutf1aa	"He is asleep.

Who can tell me which book?|`|qyqxp4abaa	I don't think you can beat A Tale of Two Cities, which to me is as good a combination of opening and closing statements as exists in literature, by my personal favorite is from The Fountainhead.  After a philosophical and psychological war has been waged and victims strewn across the battlefields of Ayn Rand's conflict between collectivism and individualism, one heroic silhouette remains in Dominque Francon's vision as she rides toward the pinnacle of concrete and symbolic architecture:  <br>  <br>  "Then there was only the ocean and the sky and the figure of Howard Roark."<br>  <br>  Like Gone With the Wind, it's short and sweet, but wraps up the story and the characters dramatically and poetically.<br>  <br>  Then again, as always, there's Kurt Vonnegut.  With so many memorable lines, perhaps Cat's Cradle's closing lines are his best: <br>  <br>  "If I were a younger man, I would write a history of human stupidity; and I would climb to the top of Mount McCabe and lie down on my back with my history for a pillow; and I would take from the ground some of the blue-white poison that makes statues of men; and I would make a statue of myself, lying on my back, grinning horribly, and thumbing my nose at You Know Who."|`|f926bbe473fcc9eb8cafb27bc2676163aa	"All was well" <br>      -Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|`|HkXYGAOdaa	"As he looked at her by firelight, saw her smile, the silver mirror dissolved before his eyes, dispelling its ungrieced ghosts like smoke upon the night, and beyong her in the dark, a promise at the present's furthest edge, a dreaming figure stirred and opened wide her golden eyes."<br>  <br>  Last line of "The Judgment of Paris" by Gore Vidal|`|5uzHW4CYaa	This is such a wonderful question, I love it! <br>  Here are a few of my favorites!

I only stopped until I could say it to myself in my mind. The last 25 words of this sentence (very long sentence, if I may add), will always be pictured in my mind at any moment of the day. I hope that what I just typed made sense.... It's from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince.<br>  <br>  --<br>  Here's another, from A Tale of Two Cities. This line just leaves you...thinking. Just simply thinking....<br>  <br>  “It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.”<br>  <br>  --<br>  And this line, from Douglas Adams' So Long, and Thanks for all the Fish. <br>  <br>  "There was a point to this story, but it has temporarily escaped the chronicler's mind." <br>  <br>  Seriously, could Adams be any more of a genius?!<br>  <br>  <br>  --<br>  The last two sentences from A Clockwork Orange just dazzled my mind. I can't remember them exactly, but they completely encompassed the generally feel and meaning of the book. <br>  <br>  --<br>  As for an ending to your question, my final answer. This is from "On the Road" by Jack Kerouac.....<br>  <br>  "So in America when the sun goes down and I sit on the old broken-down river pier watching the long, long skies over New Jersey and sense all that raw land that rolls in one unbelievable huge bulge over to the West Coast, and all that road going, all the people dreaming in the immensity of it, and in Iowa I know by now the children must be crying in the land where they let the children cry, and tonight the stars'll be out, and don't you know that God is Pooh Bear? the evening star must be drooping and shedding her sparkler dims on the prairie, which is just before the coming of complete night that blesses the earth, darkens all rivers, cups the peaks and folds the final shore in, and nobody, nobody knows what's going to happen to anybody besides the forlorn rags of growing old, I think of Dean Moriarty, I even think of Old Dean Moriarty the father we never found, I think of Dean Moriarty."<br>  <br>  Looking back at my answer I realized I had lots of long sentences. lol :)

You must understand that in this period of time, the 18th century, there were two prominent stances in the philosophical world which were understood as rationalism and empiricism. Simply put, rationalists believe that knowledge lays innate in the human mind and through sensation it is developed. This sensation comes through an intuition. As the information is already given (most believed through a divine power), these intuitions allowed this pre-existing information to be "dug up" through a physical experience. Empiricists on the other hand believe that knowledge is not innate and only through experience does one find understanding. Kant with his book Critique of Pure Reason conjoined these two belief systems. I'm sorry if I am wrong, I am only 15 and still trying to understand this ****.|`|w93uualFaa	Kant' philosophy which we have lived with for over 200 years created the problems that we see to day. The only way to counter his Altruistic beliefs is the philosophy of Ayn Rand – Objectivism. <br>  <br>  Here are some quotes for you to ponder. I do suggest you do the research and come to you own conclusions as well. <br>  <br>  ----<br>  <br>  You may also find it hard to believe that anyone could advocate the things Kant is advocating. If you doubt it, I suggest that you look up the references given and read the original works. Do not seek to escape the subject by thinking: “Oh, Kant didn’t mean it!” He did . . . .<br>  <br>  Kant is the most evil man in mankind’s history.<br>  <br>  “Brief Summary,” The Objectivist, Sept. 1971, 4 – Ayn Rand<br>  <br>  Metaphysics and Epistemology –<br>  <br>  Kant originated the technique required to sell irrational notions to the men of a skeptical, cynical age who have formally rejected mysticism without grasping the rudiments of rationality. The technique is as follows: if you want to propagate an outrageously evil idea (based on traditionally accepted doctrines), your conclusion must be brazenly clear, but your proof unintelligible. Your proof must be so tangled a mess that it will paralyze a reader’s critical faculty—a mess of evasions, equivocations, obfuscations, circumlocutions, non sequiturs, endless sentences leading nowhere, irrelevant side issues, clauses, sub-clauses and sub-sub-clauses, a meticulously lengthy proving of the obvious, and big chunks of the arbitrary thrown in as self-evident, erudite references to sciences, to pseudo-sciences, to the never-to-be-sciences, to the untraceable and the unprovable—all of it resting on a zero: the absence of definitions. I offer in evidence the Critique of Pure Reason.<br>  <br>  <br>  An Untitled Letter,”<br>  Philosophy: Who Needs It, 116 – Ayn Rand <br>  <br>  There are two different kinds of subjectivism, distinguished by their answers to the question: whose consciousness creates reality? Kant rejected the older of these two, which was the view that each man’s feelings create a private universe for him. Instead, Kant ushered in the era of social subjectivism—the view that it is not the consciousness of individuals, but of groups, that creates reality. In Kant’s system, mankind as a whole is the decisive group; what creates the phenomenal world is not the idiosyncrasies of particular individuals, but the mental structure common to all men.<br>  <br>  Later philosophers accepted Kant’s fundamental approach, but carried it a step further. If, many claimed, the mind’s structure is a brute given, which cannot be explained—as Kant had said—then there is no reason why all men should have the same mental structure. There is no reason why mankind should not be splintered into competing groups, each defined by its own distinctive type of consciousness, each vying with the others to capture and control reality.<br>  <br>  The first world movement thus to pluralize the Kantian position was Marxism, which propounded a social subjectivism in terms of competing economic classes. On this issue, as on many others, the Nazis follow the Marxists, but substitute race for class.<br>  <br>  Leonard Peikoff, The Ominous Parallels
9eecde23c79bfff877fa0b139486b009aa	normal is a relative term.  it really depends on your location.  seriously... things that are "normal" in the northeast are no where close to "normal" in the northwest.  and the south, it's like a whole other country! (and we're very proud of that fact, thank you very much!!!) <br>  <br>  then "normal" can vary from city to city within those regions, as well as household to household within those cities.  i know, growing up, that it was 'normal' for all of us kids to spend the entire day in our own rooms completely ignoring everyone else in the family. we just didn't talk to each other.  the first time i spent the night with a friend, and she said we were having "family time" i had no clue what that meant. we stayed in the living room and played board games with her parents and siblings.  it was as far from 'normal' as i knew, but was perfectly 'normal' to her, and we only lived a few miles apart.<br>  <br>  you have to define "normal" by yourself.  be normal for you. that's all that matters anyway!|`|OLcXtWQyaa	broadly speaking it means within the norm or average. anyone not able to function within the society they live in is considered to be not normal.       psychologically, human brains are supposed to function a certain way. norythmia(normalcy) is the state of a healthy brain.|`|ZtGEyNJVaa	Hiram is wrong!!! he's referring to average. <br>  <br>  normal is when you just stand there and hum and the doctor says to your mom..." that's normal" or you get embarrassed when your grandpa shows up at your sweet 16 party without his dentures ... that's normal yano...|`|mMxfVTSHaa	<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/normal?r=75" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/n...</a>|`|HA3CUl0Jaa	"Normal" is whether or not you fit the stereotype of your upbringing, ethnicity, situation, etc. Anything abnormal surprises and frightens people.

The Soviets had provided atomic missiles to be placed there. We (America) had missiles close to Moscow (in Turkey). Now, neither side has missiles close to the other. Plus, the Soviet Union no longer exists. Now our current 'enemies' are enemies on a religious basis. Some kids I went to high school with became muslim. Then I thought, no big deal.

After all, he liked to tinker with radios and television sets. But he did not help her. <br>  <br>  Thomas attended an all-girls high school that did not help her, either. At the time, scientific subjects were not considered important or suitable for women. So, no one encouraged Thomas to take the advanced math classes that were offered at her school, and she continued to look up her technological aptitude as more of a curiosity than anything else. <br>  <br>  This changed in college, when Thomas enrolled at Morgan State University as one of only two women in her class to major in physics. She was an excellent student, and soon she had acquired the knowledge of mathematics that lead her to a position as a mathematician/data analyst for NASA. <br>  <br>  Eventually Thomas moved up within NASA and served in a position of managing the development of NASA's image-processing systems for "Landsat," the first satellite to send images from outer space. In 1976, she saw something at a scientific exhibit that would lead her down a path of invention. She saw an illusion of a glowing light bulb that had been unscrewed and removed from its socket. It had been created using a second bulb pointing downward in a socket beneath the top socket, employing a concave mirror to produce the illusion of the lit bulb. Unlike flat mirrors, which produce images that appear to be inside, or behind the mirror, concave mirrors create images that appear to be real, or in front of the mirror itself. <br>  <br>  Thomas was intrigued, and wondered how such an image could be transmitted like other images were at the time. She began experimenting in 1977, setting up equipment to observe the relationship between an object and its real image relative to the positions of concave mirrors. She thought that if it were possible to present and transmit these types of realistic, three-dimensional images, great improvements could be made in video, and even television, in the future. <br>  <br>  In 1980, she received a patent for her illusion transmitter, which uses a concave mirror on the transmitting end as well as on the receiving end to produce optical illusion images. NASA uses the technology today, and scientists are currently working on ways to incorporate it into tools for surgeons to look inside the human body, and possibly for television sets and video screens one day. <br>  <br>  Thomas continued to work for NASA until her retirement in 1995, serving in such positions as Space Physics Analysis Network (SPAN) project manager and most recently associate chief of the Space Science Data Operations Office. <br>  <br>  Over the course of her career Thomas contributed to computer program designs for research related to Halley's comet, ozone hole studies, and voyager satellite development. She has received a number of NASA awards including the GSFC (Goddard Space Flight Center) Award of Merit, and the NASA Equal Opportunity Medal. She continues to mentor young students through the National Technical Association (NTA) and Science Mathematics Aerospace Research and Technology (S.M.A.R.T.), Inc..

piE8mQM3aa	I know how to get the idea of the story I'm working on. I have everything figured out from the beginning to end. It's that middle that drives me nuts. I have about 15 unfinished stories I'm working on (and hope to get published one day), but those little details in the middle (ex: what they are talking about, trying to keep up with remembering time frames, ages, places, etc...) are the pits! Everything else is no problem. Hate writes block :)|`|rchaTSI9aa	The beginning. Even if I have tons of ideas for the story, they always end up being for the middle or the end.|`|wwi7SKVpaa	For me, my teacher always tells me that I need more similes|`|oL9HDPveaa	The end. I can never come up with the end or a way to bring it about without just abruptly introducing it. Besides the end, the beginning. Same idea--I simply cannot begin a story. The middle is (mostly) easy. :)|`|B1LkXUKvaa	the periods when nothing is happening/ too much is happening!!!! when nothing is happening, i get bored, and don't feel like writing, and when too much is happening, i can't capture what is happening to every character well enough!! i end up deleting a lot. the beggining is also a bit hard, because i can't figure out at which point to start the story, and what should be happening. the end is always giving me headaches. which ending to chose? when to end it? is this ending to depressing? stories are just too delicate|`|7xestOKUaa	Definitely the beginning.. I completely agree with you there. I come up with millions of things I want to put in the story, but they can't come til later. So I get stuck at the beginning and then end up killing the story, because I just can't figure out how to start it. It's very annoying.|`|pgHlTuRnaa	for me, it's some of the convos.  See, you don't want them to sound fake or stiff or odd, or too boring and sometimes I don't know how to write it.  Especially when its like a really big part of the book.  That's the biggest and hardest thing for me.<br>  <br>  Can you read it please.

I can never come up with something perfect to end a story. Probably this is because I hate endings. I always want to read more, so when a book ends I get really sad.|`|TOAiSbPYaa	The beggings I can never think of how to stat a story. And also when I writing somethin sad it kinda makes me depressed.

Something tells me your teacher will be able to tell the difference between your writing and bad adult writing. <br>  <br>  You can literally make ANYTHING into a free verse poem. It will take you five minutes. Here:<br>  <br>  i am a terrible writer much less <br>  poet. and i have this project <br>  where i have to write a bunch of poems... <br>  <br>  i made some of the poems but <br>  i need like 3 more. can you help me write <br>  2 free verse poems? <br>  <br>  Now, this isn't much of a poem, but you get the idea. No rhymes, no real rules. Just write whatever comes into your head.|`|cbLsxrr7aa	I obviously can't write them for you, but I can give you some ideas. <br>  Try writing an ode to something: a person, a semi-precious stone, a flower, a random household object. <br>  For the person, think about their eyes, hair, how he/she smiles, his/her voice, clothing, personal qualities, hobbies, and talents. <br>  For the gemstone, think of lots of adjectives (especially color), what fruit(s) and animal(s) it reminds you of, what month it would be found in.  [tiger eye: gold shininess, a well-groomed horse, sun glinting off autumn leaves]<br>  For other things to write about, read some of Pablo Neruda's odes for inspiration. It helps to read other poems to put you in a creative mindset. <br>  Good luck on your poetry!

TL1Jkqunaa	Stalin usurped the position that had been intended for Leon Trotsky.  Lenin never made clear enough his terrible opinion of Stalin.  In order to consolidate power Stalin had to eliminate almost all of the Old Guard (people who worked with Lenin for years, who were at the forefront of the Revolution for 20 years and more before they came to power).<br>  Getting rid of pretty much everyone let him rewrite history to his favor without much fear of contradiction.<br>  FOr a fictionalized account of why people confessed read Darkness at Noon by Arther Koestler.  It is a short novel.  ANd for how re writing the past worked read 1984 by George Orwell.   Many people believed that they were helping to preserve the revolution by their confessions, and many, despite the obvious facts of disappearance of their comrades believed a public confession would lead to mercy.  In fact, most people were given sentences of exile, were exiled, and then made to disappear, through administrative sentences (not in public) of capital punishment.<br>  Others were tortured to the point that a confession leading to  inevitable death was the less painful route.|`|XLO2OdVBaa	Stalin was basically weeding out his enemies. People were probably tortured or humiliated or just tired of being questioned that they admitted to the crimes.

Then say, "this is Barbie Smith and I am looking for Suzi/Ken Miller.  Are they there?  They wrote this number down about a job they applied for and I wanted to reach them.  Sooner or later they'll say who they are and that you have the wrong number.  Suggest that they're a neighbor and ask where they live.

Don't post and questions until you've exhausted your searches.  When you do post, be sure to list name, place, and period of time in the subject of your question.  There is no need to type the surname in unless you are searching geographically - I mean if your seaching Smiths in the Smith forum, they all know that you're looking for a Smith already, right???<br>  <br>  Peruse the forums for a month or so and if you want more information and you're willing to pay for it, go  to Ancestry.com and sign up.

Get the juicy stuff about your elders first.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	hmm. <br>  If there is one word that I emphasize in research.. it is <br>  DOCUMENTATION. <br>  If something isn't documented, it is a lead, sometime a rumor, and sometimes out and out inaccurate. <br>  My next suggestion comes from the idea that not all of us HAVE FAMILY living, who we can ask. This is when you go back to using the records that are available. No one can tell you exactly WHERE THOSE records are.. it depends on where the ancestor was. I can send you to a location where you can get Texas death certificates,but that will be useless, if your grandmother died in London, or Germany. <br>  You will find that each of your ancestors are unique, but they do "lean" on each other. For this reason, you start with yourself, and not try to "jump" to the immigrant Jones, or leave out the spouse. Example.. you may want a record of the children of John and Mary Smith, and John didn't leave a will. But, knowing that Mary's family name was Jones, you might find a record that James Jones (her brother) was named guardian for the orphans of John Smith. <br>  Your birth certificate "proves" your parents (and helps you from the start, to use records). From there, you "prove" your grandparents by using records concerning your father and mother. It will hit you immediately, that mom has a birth name that you use. And.. remember.. you are looking for HER PARENTS. Knowing that she was born in Louisiana in 1957, means that is where you expect them to be, and you don't get sidetracked with persons of that name in Minnesota in 1935. <br>  Every genealogy is made up of puzzle pieces. Not only are each person a piece.. but each FACT is a piece. You want the facts, to weave them together. Notice, I don't recommend one website over another, since (1) all records are not online and (2) you limit your options if you look for "one best" site. They can be anywhere. <br>  So, pull out that birth certificate. It might seem silly, but it gets you going, it may give you facts you were unaware of (mom was born in Maine??!) and keeps you on the right path.|`|Bp6254Vbaa	Find an online people search of your choice or try the one I'm using (Check the URL below).

yZAamsT3aa	The Treaty of Versailles was a bit harsh. It was signed and agreed on putting all of the blame for World War I (Great War) on Germany. On top of paying expenses for the damages done to its economy, Germany had to deal with paying a load of money towards other countries who felt that it was the Germans' faults. What made things worse was that the Germans had sunk the US Lusitania ship which was transporting passengers along with goods to the ally, Britain. As well, the Germans were caught trying to negotiate with Mexico. The Zimmerman Telegram sent a message to them asking the people of Mexico to declare war on the United States. Everyone seemed to agree that Germany had started the war, when in fact it was kind of inevitable and had many influences to begin with. For example, MAIN (Militarism, Alliances, Imperialism and Nationalism) all hold key importance when it comes to the beginning of the Great War or World War I. I believe that it is still relevant today in that people still resent Germany for what had happened and still believe that they caused World War I.|`|0PWkMoIraa	The Treaty of Versailles was one of the peace treaties at the end of World War I. It ended the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers. It was signed on 28 June 1919, exactly five years after the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, one of the events that triggered the start of the war. The other Central Powers on the German side of World War I were dealt with in separate treaties. Although the armistice signed on 11 November 1918 ended the actual fighting, it took six months of negotiations at the Paris Peace Conference to conclude the peace treaty. Of the many provisions in the treaty, one of the most important and controversial required Germany and its allies to accept responsibility for causing the war and, under the terms of articles 231-248, to disarm, make substantial territorial concessions and pay reparations to certain countries that had formed the Entente powers. The Treaty was undermined by subsequent events starting as early as 1922 and was widely flouted by the mid-thirties.<br>  <br>  The result of these competing and sometimes incompatible goals among the victors was a compromise that nobody was satisfied with. Germany was not pacified, conciliated or permanently weakened, which would prove to be a factor leading to later conflicts
HXe1zgUtaa	Did you realize that the Macbeth's are very close to each other? They seems so close and sometimes they look like outcasts from society, concentrated in that small world they live in. <br>  Their affection has been shown when lady Macbeth tries to question both Marybeth's manhood and love, Macbeth acts. He seems to be galvanized into action when people say things that affect his dignity deeply. <br>  Most people believe that lady Macbeth was the person who taunted Macbeth, but in real fact, she is weak too. Her unsexing and filling herself with direst cruelty can imply that she is actually forcing herself to do the deed for the sake of her husband. <br>  The dismissing of guests is merely a way to prevent others from suspecting that banquo's disappearance was connected to Macbeth (dont shake thy gory locks at me). She is just soothing her husband and it would not be good to use this as a point. <br>  Once the sense of guilt comes home to roost, Lady Macbeth’s sensitivity becomes a weakness, and she is unable to cope. leading to her eventual death later. This signals that she is unable to cope with the advancement of her supposedly male ambitions.|`|6KpEFMV5aa	Yes that is she managed to keep Macbeth sane and not give anything away she was completely supportive in everything he did and provided determination and ambition in order to succeed.|`|b8rLnAOiaa	Lady MacBeth is a critical development of the play Macbeth because she essentially moves the plot along as well as help develop the plot.<br>  <br>  Spoiler Alert!<br>  <br>  In the play/novel, the whole plot/story is based off a system. A system that is ranked from the highest (angelic) to the lowest (demonic). Essentially, God is the highest power while the representative of Evil is on the lowest rank of the system.  <br>  <br>  Here's the system. (To the best of my knowledge):<br>  <br>  God<br>  King<br>  Thane<br>  Lord<br>  Gentlemen<br>  Peasants<br>  Animals<br>  Trees<br>  Rocks <br>  Inorganic Matter<br>  Demons<br>  <br>  As you can see; the system is corrupted. This system does not include a queen. Idealistically, females are de-ranked by 1. So a female peasant in the story would be considered an animal.  <br>  <br>  Back to the story. Lady Macbeth, in the story, wishes to be queen. <br>  (Understand that this story is about ambition). Her ambitious behavior led her to provoke her own husband to commit treason only so that she can be queen.  Her ambition to be queen ruined that system provided.  Due to that ambition the system now puts the queen pretty darn close to the king. Idealistically, she would be ranked as a thane. A whole new position is now there which is Queenship.<br>  <br>  The idea of the play is to correct the system. Lady Macbeth is to there to move the plot along, make a plot, and change/correct the system. Many of Shakespeares story is based on this system as well as the current king of their time; King James.<br>  <br>  So to your question; if Lady Macbeth was not there, Macbeth wouldn't commit treason because Duncan is still a great king. Lady Macbeth provides the "push" he needs and thus the plot of Macbeth. <br>  <br>  In addition; this story is based on the system. It deals with the order of things. Of course, Lady Macbeth changes that order and have corrected the system.<br>  <br>  The plot of the story is to fix the system.

That would be a really fantastic topic to pull for a presentation like that. <br>  <br>  Do you have the option of using audio/video in your intro? If so, I'm thinking that the opening few minutes of the (I believe) 5th disc in the Beatles anthology videos might be a great way to lead into that. <br>  <br>  All the DVDs start with the same little introduction. On the 5th disc, right after that, the sound of a huge crowd fades in - it's their famous concert at Shea Stadium. They show alllllll these people just packed into the place. People are trying to run past the guards, they're clinging to fences, some are just frozen with tears streaming down their faces - and the show hadn't even STARTED yet. <br>  <br>  Seeing those reactions was the thing that first made me realize what a huge influence The Beatles had. Honestly, it gave me chills, the sounds as much as the video. If their influence is the nature of your presentation, then I would say just showing that couple minutes of video could make a fairly powerful introduction, and it would be easy to segue into something else from there. <br>  <br>  Not sure if that's helpful, as far as what you were looking for, but I hope it helps. There's SO much Beatles-related stuff out there, I'm sure you'll find something that works. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|3uZpSJFRaa	Maybe you can bring some props like Lennon's glasses and some wigs and ask the judges to wear them- they are 4 like the band!<br>  <br>  gilka.co.uk|`|mSTJDbD2aa	Well if possible go dressed up in a Sergeant Pepper's Lonely Heats Club Band outfit (its possible but not likely) or play music during your presentation! Or try and adopt an English accent. Or bring a poster board of Beatles memorabilia or like you have to, show how they have influenced other music (one of the most notably Coldplay with their wannabe Sergeant Pepper's attire). Their are numerous ways to present your presentation, those are just the ones off the top of my head.|`|3cFFGPkIaa	Maybe you should include some screaming fan girls. :p<br>  The Beatles were HUGE.

iJzIIEdfaa	Yes. He killed more of his own men than he killed German soldiers. He was an idiot, sending his soldiers to attack, hoping to win by attrition. For all the Allied sacrifices, they didn't gain very much at all.|`|xl6JVATSaa	No, If he had not ordered so many to their deaths then some other imperialist "OLD SCHOOL" son of the Ruling Classes would have. This was a case of "England expects every man to do his duty, I'll be in Paris let me know how the day went". None of The Generals senior staff offices were close enough to the front to give adequate direction to the battle.|`|pFlvqhhjaa	No<br>  The offensive at the somme was forced on him by his superiors- the British and French politicians. The French army was involved in an epic battle at Verdun and defeat would knock them out of the war. Haig was ordered to attack at the Somme to divert German resources and take pressure off the French. <br>  An analysis of the battle will tell you that the biggest failure at the Somme was not Haig's tactics, but shoddy British armaments. The seven day artillery bombardment prior to the battle failed to damage the German trenches or cut the barbed wire as intended. Haig made the best of the situation that he was in. Furthermore one must realise that Haig was responsible for the series of victorys in the final months of the war that destroyed the German army. He was a supporter of new technology like tanks. Under his command the British Expeditionary Force took more German prisoners and captured more German guns than the French and Americans combined. Even John Pershing, commander of the American Expeditionary Force, said that Haig was 'the man that won the war'.
AA10729675	Yes, some call those people "old souls".  They are like children but extremely wise, sometimes wiser than their parents and punished for that.  They have to endure ridicule because they are different.  Yet after a while, they are adults and they are no longer special.  They have suffered all that just to reach a point where they are not so special.  Some are relieved.  Some are still wiser than most adults.|`|26DoxkOBaa	I think as infants and children we can't be mature but when we reach a certain age that can facilitate maturity that we acquired in past lives we can stay that way for the rest of one's life, if you don't become senile from a genetics predisposition of your body. Then after you experience that level of maturity, I think it goes away over several lives, and then you start over again until you get sick of reincarnating and stop your mind and it's constant recording of everything that happens to you as impressions. Then you stop imagining that you are mature or immature and start to mature in consciousness and move permanently above the opposites of experiences in the physical world.|`|trMsK86jaa	It can occur at an extremely young age, especially if the individual goes through a period of high stress adjustment.|`|4e977e0718d9e088255511707db887fcaa	We all go through moments of immaturity. It comes and goes as the person grows and develops.|`|rAjM5B5naa	from my Personal experience, no. i think for me it comes and goes quite rapidly. i'm 16. hormones.|`|Rj0hhZoxaa	No. After all, who would consider an infant, a baby just born, to be mature. But once maturity, however defined, is reached, it is possible to slip back into immaturity. The classic case is the person in extreme old age who becomes infantile again. In between the two end points of life, there are a seemingly unlimited levels and types of maturity and of changes in degree of maturity in an individual. <br>  <br>  Sorry to be so general, but it is a pretty general question.|`|FoIxsunVaa	Well i have very immature tastes in TV comedies, but I have mature tastes in Movies. Maturity has a thousand areas of development and is very subjective. Does it go up and down in specific areas? I haven't noticed it particularly.<br>  <br>  People in captivity revert to more juvenile even infantile behavior. True story: In the Nazi death camps fart jokes were funny for DAYS! I am not kidding. A psychiatrist and survivor wrote about it.

nE5eqyWeaa	FOOT <br>  A unit of rhythm or meter; the division in verse of a group of <br>  syllables, one of which is long or accented. For example, the line, <br>  "The boy | stood on | the burn | ing deck," has four iambic metrical feet. The fundamental components of the foot are the arsis and the thesis. The most common poetic feet used in English verse are the iamb, anapest, trochee, dactyl, and spondee, while in classical verse there are twenty-eight different feet. <br>  The other metrical feet are the amphibrach, antibacchius, antispast, bacchius, choriamb, cretic, diiamb, dispondee, dochmius, molossus, proceleusmatic, pyrrhic, and tribrach, plus two variations of the ionic, four variations of the epitrite, and four variations of the paeon. The structure of a poetic foot does not necessarily correspond to word divisions, but is determined in context by the feet which surround it. <br>  <br>  METER or METRE <br>  A measure of rhythmic quantity; the organized succession of groups of syllables at basically regular intervals in a line of poetry, according to definite metrical patterns. In classic Greek and Latin versification, meter depended on the way long and short syllables were arranged to succeed one another, but in English the distinction is between accented and unaccented syllables. The unit of meter is the foot. Metrical lines are named for the constituent foot and for the number of feet in the line: monometer (1), dimeter (2), trimeter (3), tetrameter (4), pentameter (5), hexameter (6), heptameter (7), and octameter (8); thus, a line containing five iambic feet, for example, would be called iambic pentameter. Rarely does a metrical line exceed six feet.

For example, I would read something in philosophy and then go out to experience the world and everything around and every image would reshape itself in such a form that resembles things I have read, it makes me discover those accurate details about people and how they function in life, and about how the world operates in general, instead of concentrating on chaotic tiny images you get to see the whole picture of how everything comes into connection and operates. It also helps you to think for yourself instead of accepting everything told to you or presented to you, especially nowadays when the media is playing around with our minds, presenting images in distorted forms. Philosophy also presents a lot of values that could be used to elevate humanity. Philosophy also explains a lot of sciences and deals with them in a much deeper level.<br>  <br>  This only when I have only read very little on philosophy, but I can still tell what sort of material it could present for those who truly want to open up their eyes to more than what they encounter in daily life, in order to be able to see the big picture and unveil it's beauty.
2Ko12Elfaa	What about Thoreau's writing (in either piece or both) is normative - what does it suggest we do?  Note that he is not saying we should all live at Walden Pond.

Just read and find out:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%80%93American_War" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican%E2%...</a>|`|TIJPoudqaa	The discrepancy in your question is that the U.S. acquired California as a result of the Mexican War, not the other way around. Your question is probably how did the acquisition of Texas lead to the Mexican War. Mexico was angry with the U.S. for annexing Texas because Mexico still considered Texas their province, even after they won their independence, so they tried to get it back.
iNXqiDIYaa	As early as the first decade of the 19th century, individual dissatisfaction with the law of 1793 had taken the form of systematic assistance rendered to African Americans escaping from the South to Canada or New England: the so-called Underground Railroad.<br>  <br>  The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Prigg v. Pennsylvania in 1842 (16 Peters 539)—that state authorities could not be forced to act in fugitive slave cases, but that national authorities must carry out the national law—was followed by legislation in Massachusetts (1843), Vermont (1843), Pennsylvania (1847) and Rhode Island (1848), forbidding state officials from aiding in enforcing the law and refusing the use of state jails for fugitive slaves .<br>  <br>  The demand from the South for more effective Federal legislation was voiced in the second fugitive slave law, drafted by Senator James Murray Mason of Virginia, grandson of George Mason, and enacted on September 18, 1850, as a part of the Compromise of 1850.

HkXYGAOdaa	Many people migrated to the west, and few discovered golds.  News of the discovery of gold, and its profusion of existence, drew many many more people to California to reap the benefits of the new found element.|`|fzU2hP4yaa	It didn't.<br>  <br>  Gold was discovered in early 1848.  The Gold Rush was in full swing by 1849.  California didn't become a state until 1850.  If anything it was the discovery of mineral wealth which led to California becoming a state, not statehood leading to the discovery of mineral wealth.|`|1gyzz3kxaa	The California Gold Rush (1848–1855) began on January 24, 1848, when gold was discovered by James W. Marshall at Sutter's Mill, in Coloma, California.[1] News of the discovery soon spread, resulting in some 300,000 men, women, and children coming to California from the rest of the United States and abroad.<br>  <br>  The effects of the Gold Rush were substantial. San Francisco grew from a tiny hamlet of tents to a boomtown, and roads, churches, schools and other towns were built throughout California. A system of laws and a government were created, leading to the admission of California as a state in 1850. New methods of transportation developed as steamships came into regular service and railroads were built. The business of agriculture, California's next major growth field, was started on a wide scale throughout the state. However, the Gold Rush also had negative effects: Native Americans were attacked and pushed off traditional lands, and gold mining caused environmental harm.

98044134f8036dcdf4932e842ca0bfd0aa	I think that humans need some type of love, be it familial or the friendship kind. I know that it's been proven that infants will die without being shown love (even if all their nutritional needs are met, if they aren't ever held or spoken to, they die). However as humans age, we are better able to survive independently of others. Still, some handle isolation really well and can live to a ripe old age as pretty much a hermit, while others commit suicide because of their loneliness. I’m not a psychology major, but I imagine there are probably several factors that determine which end of the spectrum an individual falls on.<br>  <br>  As for romantic love, obviously a lot of people put emphasis on it. There's even a national holiday (Valentine’s Day) centered around romantic love. But I do think it's overrated. The divorce rate is sky high, and a high percentage of people who do stay married only do so because they're too afraid to start over (because of financial reasons, and/or because they don't want be alone and don't think they'll be able to find anyone else), they stay together for their children, or they stay because they're in an abusive relationship and are too afraid to leave. It's extremely rare that you come across a truly happy relationship after the couple has been together more than a few years.<br>  <br>  There is an instinct in humans that drives us to be social. I suppose it’s for survival. It’s easier to survive within a community than if you were truly alone. If we didn’t have a society, it would be each individual against the rest of the world, competing for resources. Form a society and work together, and your odds of survival greatly increase.<br>  <br>  Society has it’s downfalls though. It puts pressure on, and tries to push it’s beliefs and habits on all of it’s citizens. And there’s no denying that being in love feels good, kinda like a drug. Sure it hurts like hell when the person you love is gone, but while you’re with them, you feel absolutely wonderful. It feels like no matter what else happens in life, as long as you have each other everything will be okay. Love is an addiction. There was even a recent brain study that showed that people who were heartbroken were pretty much going through the equivalent of withdrawl.<br>  <br>  As far as relationships go, I guess the main reason there's so much emphasis on marriage and stuff is mainly because of religion. Religion has been driving it into people's heads for ages that women need someone to take care of them, and men need to spread their seed around and repopulate the species.<br>  <br>  Put the addictive nature of love together with the religious “obligation” to get married, and you have a society that’s obsessed with the idea of finding a soulmate and having 2.5 children while living in a nice house surrounded by a white picket fence.<br>  <br>  Now, all that said, I would also like to add that love is not caused by peer pressure (no matter how much emphasis our peers place on it). Love happens whether you want it to or not. There are asexual people who never fall in love or have any romantic inclinations towards anyone, but the vast majority of the population is not immune to this “drug” called Love. If you meet someone and fall in love, it just happens, and there’s nothing you can do to stop it. Love is not a choice. It either happens or it doesn’t. And if it does happen, you can either do nothing and feel like an alcoholic without his drink, or you can jump into a relationship and just hope and pray that you’re one of the very rare people that do actually live happily ever after.|`|AA11261740	Truly?

fcf8a9da7cd0ed8382f55b3b1bc00293aa	I don't think you can generalize. I think that most people who are educated about Imperialism, which was practiced and is still practiced by many nations, understand that it was a mixed bag: Some good, some bad. However, it is illustrative to note that when the British colonies of places like Singapore and others in Asia were taken over by the Japanese, the local residents were very happy to see the British return. Why? Because while no one likes to be a colony, the British were better than most, if not all, colonists. I think it's also worth noting that while out-and-out colonization doesn't happen as much these days, it's much easier for powerful nations to colonize other nations economically and simply influence their internal politics and power structures from the outside.|`|9ZQnd2rmaa	Are the Spaniards ashamed of their forays into South America, the Belgians,Dutch,Portugese and Italians because of their colonies, the Italians because of the Romans forcibly colonising virtually everyone, Scandinavians because of the Vikings, North Africans because of barbary Pirates, the French because of the Normans,and so on and so on and so on....<br>    Sure,people are aware that things LONG AGO were done that should not  have been done, by the UK and pretty  much every country out there.That is history.

And since all or most living creatures BREATHE AIR and AIR surrounds the globe, a person with a soul can enter ANY LIVING CREATURE to experience THEIR LIFE as it is unfolding. <br>  <br>  Walt Whitman described ALL OF THESE THINGS in his seminal work, LEAVES OF GRASS.<br>  <br>  A soul come when one has penetrated the third state of consciousness.

The war arose from British and French mistrust of Russia's ambitions in the Balkans. It began with an allied Anglo‐French expedition to the Crimea to attack the Russian Black Sea city of Sevastopol. The battles of the River Alma, Balaclava (including the charge of the Light Brigade), and Inkerman in 1854 led to a siege which, owing to military mismanagement, lasted for a year until September 1855. The war was ended by the Treaty of Paris in 1856. The scandal surrounding French and British losses through disease led to the organization of proper military nursing services by Florence Nightingale.<br>  <br>  1853<br>  Russia invaded the Balkans (from which they were compelled to withdraw by Austrian intervention) and sank the Turkish fleet at the Battle of Sinope on 30 November.<br>  <br>  1854 Britain and France declared war on Russia, invaded the Crimea, and laid siege to Sevastopol (September 1854–September 1855).

I'd say jared and melanie, they are so happy to be back together and are never apart. They are the most likely candidates for me right now. Besides Melanie deserves some really luck.

HkXYGAOdaa	No, because imperialism is exploitation of the weak by the strong in the name of higher purpose of spreading democracy or expansion of territories, which belongs to others.  Imperialism has always caused vicious bloodshed, and massacre of inhabitants of conquered territory.|`|YA36FUf1aa	Definitely not. It is an ideology which basically endorses one nation imposing itself on various other parts of the world, destroying their culture and treating the populations as 'inferior'.<br>  <br>  I don't think there is anything remotely good about a country annexing territories and exploiting the native population for economic gain and to exercise their self-obsession while insulting and desecrating any culture or idea which is not theirs.|`|kJ4g1vujaa	You can make an argument that it was - railways and roads and systems of government etc.  <br>  <br>  What did the Romans ever do for us?

Remember the British empire reached its peak in 1880 and was almost gone by 1945.<br>  <br>  My argument seems to fall down when you look at the state of former colonies but commercial exploitation continues today by corporations rather than empires.|`|RoLcpujNaa	sure, it was a good way to get rich for powerful countries<br>  as india provided for britain raw materials &markets for their manufactured goods.  <br>  the only country the imperialism was mostly harmless :) was Japan - they got rid of the Europeans quite fast.<br>  the chinese suffered more - the british decided it was to costly for them simply to rule it as they ruled India so they only demanded from the emperor access to the mainland (the rights to sell their goods) - quite soon the british merchants began to sell the high profit opium - the chinese opposed it, so the british fought two wars (I.and II. opium war) for their right to sell opium, later china become on the status of Most Favoured Nation (=meaning all the european powers got the right to squeze china  )<br>  but i think the worst was in Africa :<br>  britain/france's presence wasn't a catastrophe<br>  as such but their making borders with rulers in africa that cut across tribes... this is one of the causes of the fighting there now...and their use of "technological advancements"  is mostly buying weapons and using them... <br>  <br>  & don't believe this crap about "The White Man's Burden" i.e.<br>  that the more developed countries shared their superior culture and generously teached the natives...<br>  i think teaching the africans to sing christian hymns (as the french liked to do)  or teach them the poems of william wordsworth (as the british did) was more cruel to the poor natives than the merciless tortures invented by the Dutch in Indonesia ;)<br>  <br>  but Johnny is right, railway is cool <br>  we still use the one the british constructed between Tel Aviv - Haifa :)|`|pFlvqhhjaa	Imperialism lead to the advancement of human life.<br>  If there was no imperialism you make europe poorer and butterfly away technological advancements like the agricultural and industrial revolutions.
s01aHfcuaa	Fascist nations are autocratic, ultra-nationalistic and often expansionistic. They believe that the individual's role is to serve the state (not the other way around). They are often headed by highly charistmatic leaders who are in some cases revered almost like gods. In fascist states, all opposition to and criticism of the existing regime is severely suppressed, and these regimes are often totalitarian in that they attempt to control every aspect of their populations (political propaganda can pervade the education system, etc.).<br>  <br>  A good example of a fascist state is Mussolini's Italy, and Nazism in Germany, although Nazism was a different take on fascist ideals. It was built on the idea of the greatness of the German state, but linked the concept of national identity with the concept of race.|`|pexxZB8Daa	the state dominates society which exists to support it, there is a mixed economy with gov. intervention, usu. militarism
YWxQV8gZaa	I completely disagree with you.<br>  Greeting card dialogue: he was born in 1901, edward is bound to speak formally<br>  The sexism in the books is debatable and completely a matter of opinion. Personally, i don't think the book is particularly sexist.Bella and Edward have a very intense relationship which was pretty much love at first sight. The "Stalker-like" characteristics you pointed out was just a way of showing affection without getting too close. Edward's reaction to Jacob was simply his over-protective nature acting up. Remember that Jacob is Edward's natural enemy; would you really want your girlfriend/boyfriend hanging round with someone you would like dead?<br>  Meyer never stated that vampires can't reproduce. If you look at her website it goes into more detail about the logistics behind Bella getting pregnant. In interiews Meyer talks about how it is impossible for a FEMALE vampire to get pregnant, she never mentions male vampires at all.<br>  People enjoy Meyer's writing not because of the quality but because of the plot and the depth she puts into the characters. if she was such a terrible writer how did she manage to make millions of teenage girls fall in love with her characters? I'll be the first to admit that her writing isn't perfect. Sometimes she's a bit too wordy and she goes into pointless details however, the inventive plot which is full of twists and keeps readers guessing whilst also includes intense and deep romance without being trashy. Doesn't that compensate for the "overused adjectives"? <br>  Meyer also manages to give readers hope that true love exists and she sets high moral standards for teenagers; a key example being the fact that edward and bella do not have sex before marriage. She conveys her own personal beliefs and standards.<br>  Overall, even though I disagree with a lot of what you are saying, this article is well written. I hope your school paper likes it but just be prepared for a lot of backlash from twilight fans!|`|kLNhAEVpaa	I agree.<br>  About EVERYTHING.|`|zhL83fSlaa	Sounds good enough to me.

The relationship is very shallow, completely unplausible, and that so-called "love" they share is really over-active hormones. Bella is whiny, a cliched "quasi-gothic" brat who is also over-dramatic and annoying. (I mean, the whole post-break up scene? So pathetic, and not in a sympathy-inducing way.) Edward is creepy and boring, and propagates the stupid idea that "jealousy is love". If he loved her, he wouldn't try to keep her away from her friends, whether they were male or female. Control doesn't equal love.<br>  <br>  If you want to read a truly satisfying romance with a teen couple, read "A Walk to Remember" by Nicholas Sparks. The movie, starring Mandy Moore, was just as good as the book.|`|AA11651559	Yes, thank you very much. She puts to shame other writers who can actually write, and the more writers like her that are made famous by nonsense books the less real writers get a chance. <br>  <br>  Not only that but "Twilight" has influenced the rest of the 'young adult' section of book stores to sell nothing but vampire novels. <br>  <br>  Now I'm not saying it is all bad but this is too much. I agree with SK as well, I may not like his books but no one can deny he is one of the top writers of today, and in result of this; he knows what he's talking about.|`|B1LkXUKvaa	I'm not a hater or a lover, i'm a neutral (only mention switzerland if u want to piss me off)<br>  i think this a good article, and it is true.

JKR is just way too good. i think any "twilighter" in their right mind would not dare say SM is better than JKR cuz that's a load of bull. but she is better than a lot of books i have read (dear dumb diary series anyone?) so people who can honestly say that it is the worst book you have ever read, i envy you, because you have picked winners for all your book choices, while i have gone through many where throughout the entire book, to the last page, i was trying to figure out when it would get better/|`|gROGDV77aa	i am offended<br>  1. edwards is so so not annoying<br>  2.bella cooks and cleans because charlie cant!<br>  3. stephanie meyer is a great writer!<br>  <br>  but i think you are a great writer it is cool to see twilight from some one else point of view!<br>  you should really send it to your schools newspaper<br>  (have to agree with the whole bella getting pregnant thing i didnt really  make any sense)
FQLlne9vaa	Some societies flourished during the early modern times and benefited economically from the slave trade. Those Africans who raided, took captives, and sold slaves to Europeans profited handsomely from the trade, as did the port cities and the states that coordinated trade with European merchants. Asante, Dahomey, and Oyo peoples, for example, took advantage of the slave trade to obtain firearms from European merchants and build powerful states in west Africa.On the whole, Africa suffered serious losses from the slave trade. The Atlantic slave trade alone deprived Afriacn societies of about 16 million individuals. While diverting labor from Africa to other lands, the slave trade also distorted African sex ratios, since approximately two-thirds of all exported slaves were males. This sexual imbalance encouraged Africans to practice polygamy and forced women to take on duties that in earlier times had been the responsibility of men. Apart from its demographic and social effects, the slave trade also brought turmoil to African societies.

When did Elizabeth I become a virgin again?|`|1gyzz3kxaa	Teenage Scandal of Princess Elizabeth<br>  Thomas Seymour and Elizabeth became friends. Thomas was reported to have paid morning visits to Elizabeth, in her bedchamber, before she was dressed. There was romping, laughing and giggling. Elizabeth was very flattered. She was receiving attention from a handsome, older man. No one knows how far these romps went. Seymour was reported to have extended this 'playfulness' in the presence of his wife and the servants. There was a report of Seymour slashing and ripping the gown of Elizabeth in the gardens of the house. Talk started - gossip increased. Elizabeth denied any scandal or bad behaviour. But things had gone too far and early in 1548 Elizabeth leaves Katherine Parr's household under questionable circumstances. There appeared to be no animosity between Katharine and Elizabeth. Neither were comfortable with the conduct of Seymour and it is possible that Elizabeth was sent away for her own protection.|`|AA10248239	I don't think they actually were intimate.

There's no telling how much money the series authors make - the popular ones are millionaires, and the unpopular ones are probably doing okay.

No.  That is belief and that is how close you are to your father.  Your belief when talking to God should be simple and strong.

ZB9zkbxxaa	Ordained a Roman Catholic priest in 1923, he became pastor of a Michigan church. In 1930 he began radio broadcasts of his sermons, into which he gradually injected reactionary political statements and anti-Semitic rhetoric. His sermons attracted one of the first deeply loyal mass audiences in broadcast history. He attacked Herbert Hoover and later turned on Franklin Roosevelt and the New Deal. His magazine, Social Justice, targeted Wall Street, communism, and Jews. It was banned from the mails and ceased publication in 1942, the same year the Catholic hierarchy ordered Coughlin to stop broadcasting.

eU2wZy7Aaa	Okay. Definitely don't start doing pointe by yourself. What you can do (and will help a lot) is foot/ankle strengthening before classes start. Make sure to stretch your feet out thoroughly before beginning. Roll your ankles with your hands as well. Then work on releves in 6th (parallel), 1st, and 2nd - doing half fast releves and half slow releves making sure to roll entirely through your foot (don't just use the momentum to get you up!). Also do releves on one leg - it gives your calves a work out too! You should also work on your balance by holding demi releve in 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 5th, and also in revire/pase. I hope this helps :)|`|0WASp0bHaa	Do Not practice on your own. You need a professional ballet teacher guiding you.

You have a great use of adjectives and descriptions so that I can picture the character and the environment they are in. You have created a good setting upon which to base the story... I like it so far because of this, and because the way you ended the story up above makes me want to keep reading to discover what exactly is going on with Trevor, Zoe, and Zoe's mom.

KUVRekuZaa	"Social Insurance, and allied causes" by William Beveridge was a surprise best seller of 1942. Published just after the British victory at El-Alemain it came out at a time when the British percived the tide of war as turning in their favour. The Beveridge report produced a vision of the future that could be seen as something worth fighting for, a future without Disease, Squalor, Ignorance or Poverty. <br>  Beveridge proposed what we would now see as the "Welfare State" - Poverty was to be eliminated by policies to reduce or eliminate unemployment, with benifits for those who could not work through old age and sickness and due to unemployment, which would replace the existing, inadequate provisions. Beveridge also proposed the creation of a National health service instead of private medicine availible only for those who could afford it, to be paid for by everyone contributing to a "national insurance scheme".<br>  <br>  While Beveridge did not start the welfare state (pensions and some provisions for unemployment already existed) the implimentation of the report after the War by a labour government (and opposed by Churchill) was a massive leap forward in welfare provisions. The most significant advance was that beveridge linked together policies of Education, Health, Housing and Economic policys to promote full employment along with benifits payments. These ideas lead to the passing by the Labour Government of the Family Allowances Act 1945 , National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1946, National Insurance Act 1946, National Health Service Act 1946, Pensions (Increase) Act 1947, Landlord and Tenant (Rent Control) Act 1949, National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act 1948, and the National Insurance Act 1949|`|kJ4g1vujaa	The report came out of the experience of WW2 and aimed to tackle; <br>  Poverty, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness<br>  <br>  It laid the foundations of the NHS and National Insurance.|`|AA11203798	The beverage report highlighted the lack of affordable medical help, penury of pensioners, plight of the unemployed, as well as optical and dental affordability by people on low incomes. It proposed a National Insurance Scheme, based on a deducted amount from wages to ensure all british citizens received medical  treatment free at point of supply. It also included proposals for a minimum pension on retirement, and unemployment payment, and child care allowance. This eventually became  law after much dissent. Thus the welfare state as we know it came into being.

They had voted to join the Union - why should they not vote to leave the Union.<br>  <br>  But the South lost the war - and victors make the rules - and the victors also write the history books.  So yes - the North certainly figured it was a "crime" for the South to leave the Union.

HNgUvLYzaa	The fundamentals of your answer should revolve around three factors: Christianity on a scale never seen before, the conversation between east and west and the expansion of Europe.<br>  <br>  The first, Christianity, is easy to explain: tens of thousands (J. Phillips, 'The Crusades', estimated 60,000 went to the Holy Land between 1095 and 1100) of men (and indeed women) went to 'free the path to the Holy Sepulchre'.  What this meant for Europe was a new and fervent definition of what it meant to be Christian.  While Kings did not participate until the later crusades, it quickly became a status symbol.  For example, Stephen-Henry (one of the leaders of the First Crusade at Antioch) returned home to his wife, Adela of Blois around the turn of the c.12.  She sent him back.  It was too humiliating for their family that he had abandoned his men.  Despite the fact that he died on returning, it symbolises the importance of this penitential act. <br>  <br>  Indeed, there was a change in the ideas of Christian doctrine. These men thought themselves not just Knights of Christ, but pilgrims, going to the Holy Land (at least after Claremont in 1095) for the remission of all their sins.<br>  <br>  The conversation between east and west can be best illustrated by the Military Orders.  Initially formed to protect the pilgrims, these new warrior monks (heralded by St Bernard of Clairvaux, in his 'In Praise of the new Knighthood') gained great wealth.  Most of this was held in Europe.  By holding estates in Europe and in the Levant, they were able to facilitate the transfer of money between the two areas.  E.g. Kings Louis VII and Louis IX of France were leant funds for their respective Crusades, providing 2,500 out of 4,000 crossbowmen for the fifth crusade.  They also helped support Henry III in his minority of 1216 to 1227.  With this money lending, the Order “formed the foundation of a close relationship [with]…European monarchs throughout its history.” (Helen Nicholson, The Knights Hospitallers, The Boydell Press, 2003, p. 105).<br>  <br>  The expansion aspect can be linked back to the wealth of the Templars - you can discuss how Europe may have been satisfying the imperial lust.  (Although that argument is easily flawed).  What is important is to note that with the crusades a more conscious idea of 'Europe' formed - for an identity is often gathered by defining what one is not.  i.e. Christian, not Muslim!<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope this helps.  A good place to start reading would be on of Riley-Smith's books, maybe the Ox. Illustrated History.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pexxZB8Daa	people died, etc.|`|TNE6uFkTaa	It actually helped educate people about what was going on in the East and about the Eastern people.

REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period!

They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC still exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises.

oHO0XOQVaa	Here's information about what's required for a portfolio to be presented to them.<br>  I think with any portfolio it's a good idea to show a variety of media. It's good to also show that you have direction; you can do that with a repeated theme or style to begin with..something that connects all the pieces together conceptually or visually.<br>  <br>  -------------------<br>  Drawings<br>  Three drawing samples are required of all candidates. Each drawing must be done using graphite pencil on a sheet of white paper measuring 16 x 20"; other drawing materials should not be used. The first drawing must represent a bicycle; the second drawing may be of any subject or situation but your finished drawing must utilize both sides of the sheet of drawing paper; for the third drawing, begin with a sheet of paper, alter the form of this paper in any way you wish and then make a drawing of this altered form. You may approach these three drawings in any way you wish. For example, your drawings may be realistic or abstract; you may choose to draw the object alone or place it in a situation; you may draw the whole object or only a portion of it, etc. Each drawing must be signed and dated, and if necessary, should be treated to prevent smudging in handling. Each drawing should be folded in half and half again so that it will fit in your application folder in the Admissions Office. On the outside of each folded drawing print your full name.<br>  <br>  Portfolio<br>  Your portfolio should consist of 12 to 20 examples of any type of two- or three-dimensional work you have completed recently. We suggest that your work reflect your interests, experience and abilities in the arts to date. It may be in any media, may be finished or in sketch form, and may be from an assigned class project or be self directed.<br>  <br>  Your portfolio must be reproduced and may be submitted as 35mm slides, as unmounted photographic prints no larger than 8 1/2" x 11" or as digital image files on a CD or DVD. We will not accept work posted on a website as your portfolio submission.<br>  <br>  Slides should be arranged in a plastic slide-holder page. If you choose to send your portfolio as digital files, each image should be submitted as a separate file in .jpg format. Individual file sizes should not exceed 3MB. Do not combine images in a prepared presentation or slideshow of any type (i.e. PowerPoint). You should also include a printed contact sheet/thumbnail page of the images on your disk. Please do not affix any adhesive labels to your CD/DVD.<br>  <br>  Time-based work or performance pieces may be submitted in video format or as QuickTime files on a CD or DVD.<br>  <br>  Whichever format you select, include a work description sheet. Number the examples you are submitting and on your description page list the corresponding number, medium, size, date of completion and title for each work.<br>  <br>  Please note: it is very important that your full name and address are clearly noted on your individual slides, prints or CD/DVD and your description and thumbnail pages.|`|gL8bN0eqaa	depending on your area, hopefully theres a college that offers precollege classes. i'm currently in portfolio workshop. classes like that are a good way to start and also its something awesome to put on your application.

TBNaPkl6aa	As far as names go, that could vary by region or class, but many of them weren't all that different from what we name our kids today.  Of course names from the Bible were popular, and many of the ones I've seen were Old Testament.  In the late part of the century, more classical sounding names were gaining popularity too, particularly for women, but I'd say upper class women were more likely to have the classical female names.  If you were a slave, some masters gave their slaves very classical-sounding names, and some historians think the masters did this on purpose, and can be likened to how they would name a dog (e.g., Caesar, Brutus, etc.).  Some of the names were just downright weird; when doing my research on court cases from the late 1700s, I've come across goofy names like Eliphalet and Theodosia.  Weird, huh?  :)<br>  <br>  It's harder to say what their everyday speech was like.  It was probably as varied as the speech of different people today.  Some of them could have sounded English, some had very nasal New England accents.  As far as the types of words they'd use, four-letter words would not have been acceptable common language of course, but they existed.  I think their speech was a bit more formal than we have today, and they did use different idiomatic expressions (e.g., getting "macaronied" would have meant dressing up and getting fixed up for a ball or something like that, but trying too hard to look good).<br>  <br>  If you have time to consult books, I remember an author of a book called "Paul Rever's Ride" talked a bit about how New Englanders might have sounded, and he said people tended to write phonetically back then, therefore, they wrote how they sounded out words.  Overall, if you really want to learn more about their speech (how they sounded or their vocabulary) it would be a good idea maybe for you to Google letters of people who lived in the time period, keeping in mind that many surviving letters were from the upper class, who weren't always representative of the population.  They would sound more educated.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|TNE6uFkTaa	i saw a documentary years ago on PBS and the person who was doing the show (The Story of English) said that the drawl that people in the deep south speak now is like the way people in England would sound like in the 1700s.

I mean if u ask anyone it's likely that they'll give you diffrent answers|`|FoIxsunVaa	the soul is the part that will ROT IN HELL if one doesn't do one's OWN HOMEWORK.<br>  <br>  But seriously, are you kidding me?|`|AA11564934	No there is no soul.  Humans are like any other animal and death is the end.|`|KXiwLOtOaa	Soul is really just a word for person. If you look at the bible at says God breathed life into Adam and he "became" a living soul so there is no real separation between body and soul. More recently the word soul has come to replace the word spirit which would be more along the lines of life force and might arguably survive beyond the physical but then we are really in the realm of opinion and conjecture so any view is as good as the next.|`|AA12079397	Between creatures (including human beings) and God there are millions of invisible elements. There are divisions too. Human being is a combination of several spirits. We are just robots in flesh created by scientist God. Each of us have memories like that of the computers'. The fed things (data= knowledge=several spirits or invisible elements) are in contact with the memories since childhood. If current (electricity) stopped the memory loses all data. This is with computer. The same thing occurs to all of us. Computers are functioning by electric power but human beings are functioning by natural power. We call this as soul. This soul is nothing but simply a power like electricity. If this is stopped our memories lose all data (all spirits or invisible elements). These spirits scatter and go to different places. No one lives in the form of spirit or anything after death. This is my opinion.|`|5aa85a95b408ef76e4ff98d746b7e699aa	Energy cannot be created or destroyed but will and can change form.  I believe that the soul is and has energy and therefore at the death of the body changes form.  I don;t know how that form manifests.  Good luck on your project.  Blessings on you.|`|q791er1naa	If the body is needed for the soul to exist initially, why would it be able to live once the body is gone?|`|2jLXBRiJaa	There is no soul.What is thought of the soul is either the energy of one's body or that voice in ur head with which you think but niether is it.If you break it down the energy in your body are just atp molecules that die out when you do and the voice in ur head is ur brain process which also dies with you , so no.The soul could not exist without the body it would need a way to sustain itself which it cannot without a body.|`|AA11187637	a sole is the kind of person you are good or bad and yes it does exist after you die when you go to meet your maker ! hope that helped
HkXYGAOdaa	All this would not have happened, I suppose:<br>  <br>  Only one church existed in Western Europe in the year 1500. The Roman Catholic Church. At the top was the Pope in Rome who literally governed everything. The Protestant Reformation resulted with the split in Western Christendom. These three things greatly affected the Reformation: The Renaissance, both Italian (in how secularization was beginning to dominate thought) and Northern (how Church Reform led eventually to Reformation by Luther); The Printing Press (which w/o the reformation would not have happened); and last the rise of powerful nation-states headed by a monarch. Now reformation is not how this guy Luther changed everything, Reformation is more about how the Church and its ideals split within different people, Reformation is Complex, Intriguing, and Compelling (It would make a good fiction book).<br>  <br>  The Church was in disarray on the eve of Reformation. For example the Black Death struck the population of Europe. Growing Anticlericalism: Disrespect towards the clergy. Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales is a perfect example of Anticlericalism. And in addition to that the schism as mentioned before. Other problems was that the clergy was becoming increasingly poorly educated. Simony: the selling of church offices, was another problem.<br>  <br>  Enter Martin Luther: The central figure of this story. Luther (1483-1546) had his initial beef concerning indulgences. Indulgences began during the crusades, and offered at this early time of the crusades to the knights who were fighting for Christendom. Indulgences is the idea that if you gave the church some money, in essence if you bought indulgences from the church, once you died, your soul would spent less time in purgatory and go faster to Heaven. The Papacy sold this to raise church funds. Johann Tetzel, the seller even had a phrase for it: "As soon as gold in the basin rings, the soul to heaven rings."<br>  <br>  Luther got pissed at this. He posted up his 95 theses at Wittenberg Castle, in which he denounced the selling of indulgences. Part of his anger was that German money was going to Rome. Thanks to the printing press, the 95 theses were printed all over Germany. In Address to the Christian Nobility, he said that secular gov't had the right to reform the church. Now Luther wasn't stupid. To a degree he sucked up to the nobles because he knew that if the nobles went with him, that would mean that his ideas, and later his reformation would be successful, because it had support from the VIPs. In On the Babylonian Captivity of the Church, Luther attacked the sacraments. Finally in Liberty of a Christian Man, he hit it: salvation by faith alone. In response Pope Leo X issued a Bull (papal decree, not the other kind of bull...) and demanded that Luther recant. Luther took the Bull, went outside and publicly burned it, he no longer accepted papal authority, and the pope excommunicated him. In 1521 he went before the Diet of Worms, when asked by Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor,<br>  <br>          "Do you or do you not repudiate your books and the errors that contain?"<br>  <br>  Luther responded,<br>  <br>          "Unless I am convicted by Scripture and plain reason - I do not accept the authority     of popes and councils, for they have contradicted each other - my conscious is captive to the Word of God; I cannot and I will not recant anything, for to go against conscience is neither right nor safe. God help me, Amen."<br>  <br>  Luther was banned by the Empire. During his time as an "outlaw" he translated the Bible into German.<br>  <br>  Luther went from 7 to 2 sacraments, he only left baptism and communion. He rejected Transubstantiation, died away with monasticism and celibacy of the clergy. And he himself left the monastery (duh!), ran off with some girl, got married, and had several children.<br>  <br>  Within 30 years of his 95 theses the Reformation reached N. Germany, Scandinavia, England, Scotland, parts of the Netherlands, France, and Switzerland. Luther and his church were social conservatives and they did not pose a threat to the existing social order. Luther was willing to subordinate his church to the authority of German princes. <br>  <br>  Another reason why Reformation was successful: When Max, HRE (Holy Roman Emperor) died his grandson and heir, Charles V became HRE. He was fighting with France's Francis I. Charles had huge commitments, because he was also ruler of Spain and its colonies in America, of the Netherlands, of Southern Italy, and of the Hapsburg possessions of Austria.<br>  <br>  In 1555 Charles V was forced to sign the Peace of Augsburg. This treaty granted legal recognition for Lutheranism in those territories ruled by a Lutheran Leader, while a Catholic Leader remained Catholic.

MHFuJGdGaa	Those nerves are a powerful tool that an actor uses when performing.  Notice the importance of the word "use," those feelings are never "covered-up" nor are they ever completely rid of.  Through the development of a strong technique and competent training you'll learn to use that adrenaline rush to focus your mind and spirit.  Don't try to rid yourself of it, simply acknowledge it.  The next time you are on stage say to yourself: "I am feeling anxious.  This is because I am not used to performing for this many people; it is a natural response from my body which I have control of.  There is no reason other than the release of adrenaline to feel nervous, nothing bad will happen which I am not capable of overcoming."|`|WQ7If94Zaa	Well first you would have to be a male in order to be an actor.

Anyone who takes a conscious stand to think, speak and behave in a manner conducive to proper human conduct, development and improvement, without regard to gender, religious preference, race, is worthy of our ear.  Reason and high uncompromising morality are the only guardians of civilization; when either is breached we lose degrees of man/womanhood.  Such a scar is not as quick to heal as a scraped knee.  Health awareness is paramount because what we consume enters our blood stream which flows through our brain which is the repository of the mind.  Poison the body, poison the mind.  We need a consistent example who has evolved from cowardice and pessimism.  "He who has overcome doubt and fear has overcome failure."
e4b32e33b8c5f290f2ac40c695f487f2aa	I think there are two things - <br>  Japan supported the US in WWI, and subsequently was given some territory as a reward, but was later forced to return it to Russia <br>  ( other countries in the Allies got a LOT of territory - all of Germany's colonies and pretty much all of the Mideast) - so there was some resentment...(There's a bunch of stuff about imperialism here, pretty much everyone in Europe and the US were asses back in the 1800's)<br>  <br>  Another thing was more for technical reasons - Japan was running out of oil supplies to support their campaign in China, and needed to take over the Philipines for oil, which was controlled by the US at that time.

WewCtMpzaa	A real wool Kilt is often tailored made. To really look good in a Kilt, it needs to be measured to your size. These kilts are very expensive, and can damaged. You can call around to some of the Scottish groups in your area, even some pipe bands. Some might have one that could be a good loaner.<br>  <br>  I would go with a Stillwater, these are very cheap machine made kilts. You can pick one up for $120 easy, and sometimes they have promotions for $90 for clearances. They try to liquidate on eBay. I have seen some used kilts being sold there, some almost given away. <br>  <br>  It's very important that you size up, because they are not like jeans. They are based on your actual length around your waist and then from hip to knees. A kilt will not be enough, if you want to look Scottish. You will also need a Sporran, Belt, and Hose. I would try to find a Kilt pin as well. You might be able to get loans on these, at least more than a kilt. I have a few of each laying around, but I am in Texas.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|g6easyBFaa	Instead of renting you can buy a value-priced kilt here:<br>  <a href="http://www.stillwaterkilts.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.stillwaterkilts.com/</a><br>  <br>   They're much cheaper because they're made of acrylic instead of wool.

But you should just write what you want. Do you think Stephenie Meyer asked everyone if she thinks Bella should be clumsy? Or JK Rowling asking everyone if she should have Ron and Harry be friends? You shouldn't care what others say about your writing unless it's positive. I think that's pretty cool for her to transform into a mermaid though. If she's some evil witch though, I really think that shouldn't happen. Is her cousin someone bad? Or is he a 'assistant' of the killer witch? Make sure to limit what this witch can do.<br>  <br>  Good luck with your writing!<br>  <br>  ~*~AmAndA~*~<br>  purplealgae@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  ps. Is this witch thing a bit like Glinda vs. Elphaba?

One thing to keep in mind, though, is that you need to set constraints and stick to them. She's a witch. Okay. But if she can do anything in the world then there's no conflict.

dQmFoRRiaa	A picture of desolation and aging, written beautifully and poignantly.  That is, to the best of my knowledge, your first ever Dorsimbra; a beautiful debut.  Wow.|`|snrdDbLAaa	Your poem reminds me of these novelettes<br>  Of which I am a stout admirer<br>  By Mr Snicket-- stifling regrets<br>  For truth, but still a sad inquirer.<br>  <br>  Her ataractic cheveleure<br>  Do not immure<br>  But emphasise<br>  All-- all! her family's demise.<br>  <br>  These fictions, yet, a touch lugubrious<br>  Convey a cubist sense of suffering<br>  Through shades of self foremost; so but in part,<br>  Your poem reminds me of these novelettes.|`|srNBx7sLaa	You listen to your Uncle.|`|JOChNigNaa	Your first line, which is also the refrain has only 9 beats. It's not too bad for an initial effort. The third person pronoun recurs too frequently, she and/or her in every single line but one, even twice in five of the lines.  This doesn't allow a reader much of an entry into the poem.  If she is dressing up in clean clothes and then walking outside a home destroyed by fire, where did she get dressed and brush her hair?  Those above already gave a critique of the rhythm. The second stanza has to be "snappy".<br>  <br>  Dorsimbra comes from the last names of the originators of the form. Frieda DORris, Robert SIMonton. and Eve BRAden.  It is capitalised.<br>  <br>  [Life is a rich adventure, and ageing is seldom pyrrhic but continues to be richly populated with new associations as well as memories and faces one looks forward to as much as back on.  One way of saying it is that life is an onion, you peel back a few layers, and you cry.  Yet you look forward to the pungency and sweetness of its taste.]|`|xFOgNOswaa	cute poem i think you should write more its so deep|`|WbRuTjmFaa	Very nice poem.. <br>  I have learned in the past 4 days that it takes more.. you need the daDum da Dum thangy goin' on....<br>  for  your  first effort I am impressed, but Peter will tell you you need to check your meter. <br>  I like it the way it is but I learned the meter anyhow just to prove I could.|`|wWL934E8aa	need 10 counts per line you got the rhyme scheme right.

Nothing in his background can excuse his behavior and the suffering he caused in a completely unnecessary war of aggression that he started. I would challenge you to read up on the true heroes of the War, those who sacrificed all so that others might live in peace. For example, while many of us in the West know something of what the Western allies did, I only recently began to understand just how much the Russians and people of eastern Europe suffered in the war, and the bravery that they showed. Read up or watch a video on the siege of Stalingrad, it will shock you.

We both believe that if Hitler became a successful artist and was accepted into art college, he would not have became a dictator. <br>  <br>  I don't think it's wrong to feel bad for him as long as you dont' support his ways of dealing with the Jews or taking over Germany. Which you don't support him of course.

SpaOGgtdaa	I think is right what you are saying that society puts too much emphasis on relationships, people see it as something cool and to show others that they have a partner, I've known some people who have enter in a relationship without loving the other person, just to be like others and talk about their partner; as human beings we need the companionship of others and that's probably why many people go into relationships thinking that that will make them happy. Though, you can be happy with yourself without necessiraly being in a relationship, your happines depends on you, the choices you make and the way you are going to start viewing yourself and the world. You can be in a relationship where there's love from both sides and still not be happy because it depends on you not on the other person. Having a partner is not bad for they can compliment each other and help each other. In a relationship that person is someone with whom you are going to have an intimate communication and affection. You say that it's hard for you to get close to people, well maybe you are not the kind of person who makes a lot of friends really quick, we are all not like that, each person is different and unique and these differences are what makes us special. The way you see yourself is the way others are going to see you. You are special and I'm sure that you have a lot of positive qualities that maybe some of us don't have. We all have personal qualities and gifts that others don't have the same way that others have some that we don't have. I've always think that I'm not greater that anybody else nor less. Don't close yourself to others, when someone aproaches to you talk with that person as if it were some one of your family, don't be afraid to talk with people you don't know, communication is an essential part of our lifes. Think were does that low self esteem comes from, was it because of others? is it worth it to be so hard with yourself? look deep inside of you and you'll find that you are an amazing person with whom people would like to hang out with, maybe is time to let that person out. There will always be people who will cretizice us but there will also be others that will lift us up. Love is probably, if not the most, important emotion we posses. All humans like to be loved in all ways. Many people wonder in the world looking for their purpose in life and were thay can find happiness, they try different things just to find in the end that all that they tried was useless because they might have find pleasure for a while but then what... Where I've only find happyness and a purpose for my life is in God. In his word I've find the peace I need for my life and the strength to confront the problems of life. I recommend you read "The Purpose Driven Life" by Rick Warren; and yes we are going to die, but do you know where are you going to go when that day comes?|`|mhDOHoSHaa	The meaning of life is really just like the common cold. it mutates in every person so there is no real cure, or in this case, no real answer. Your meaning of life is what you do in this life, how you do it, and how you fit into the grand scheme of things. You can define it in any way you can imagine. nobody can do it for you. There is no substitute for you in the eventual schematics of reality because you are the only one who designs the brackets of best fit according to size, function, and comfort. Basically, you are unique and independent from others and your definition is no better than theirs. Just because you do not agree with another's definition does not mean it is void.

5OrpCq6zaa	Fashion<br>  <br>  Because the Renaissance era encompasses approximately 150 years of history, its fashions changed dramatically from beginning to end. At the dawn of the Renaissance in 1450, clothing styles were influenced by Medieval and Gothic designs, as well as the Italian Renaissance movement in art. Women's fashions assumed a more natural appearance from their Gothic predecessors. Dresses gradually lost their long trains, and flowing skirts became increasingly popular. The robe, which was actually a dress with an attached bodice and skirt, appeared on the fashion scene. In addition, the long, rigid, corset that extended in a cone shape below the waist to a V debuted during the early part of the Renaissance period. Women also began showing their hair again. Instead of covering their heads, they adorned their coiffures with shimmering veils and dazzling jewels. In men's fashions, doublets shortened and low-necked tunics and chemises became common garb. Hose became a common necessity for the well-dressed gentleman. Brocades and velvets were among the favored fabrics for both men's and women's clothing.<br>  <br>  After the turn of the 15th century, Renaissance fashions began to follow German styles. The simple, natural styles of the early period were replaced with horizontal, massive styles. Men's fashions became square in cut and elaborately trimmed. Breeches were lengthened, and linen chemises were decorated with lace edges and frills at the neck and sleeves. Women's gowns became voluminous, with skirts heavily pleated and supported underneath by hoops made of wire or wicker and held together with ribbons or tapes. The hoopskirt, called the farthingale, reached its maximum width around 1600, when it became a cartwheel or drum shape. Sleeves were puffed and necklines were adorned with high-standing collars with expanded ruffs or circular lace. Men's clothing adopted a similar style, with puffed trunk hose, balloon sleeves, padded doublets, and large ruff collars. "Slashing" (cutting the outer layer of cloth to reveal an inner layer of contrasting color and fabric), also became popular in both men's and women's fashions. The trend for the elaborate also extended to hairstyles. Women began wearing headdresses, at first a simple hood which then became peaked. Men wore broad hats that were sometimes trimmed with gemstones. By the end of the Renaissance in 1600, fashion had reached a zenith under the Elizabethan period.<br>  <br>  Food and Cooking<br>  <br>  During the Renaissance, as in ages past, food was a matter of social class, as well as region and season. In modest European homes, meat was not necessarily served every day (although for special occasions, meat dishes were often served in abundance, to display the generosity of the host). Bread was the fundamental staple for the lower and middle classes, was made with cheaper grains than wheat: barley and rye, for example. Meals for the lower social classes usually consisted of dark bread such as rye or barley, and cheese or curds. Servants living in wealthy households usually dined better, enjoying meals of beef or fowl, refined breads, pudding, cod and ale. They also had access to certain seasonings such as salt. The middle class enjoyed more variety, as each meal generally consisted of several different dishes, with a game bird of some kind being the standard main course. For dessert, the middle class dined on sweets and confections with spiced wine. Meals for the wealthiest classes were similar to those of the middle class, although the rich also enjoyed unusual delicacies such as molden jelly and pastries. The bread of the upper classes was made with a higher proportion of wheat, which was more finely ground and sifted. Stale bread was cut into squares and used for trenchers, a surface on which to serve other foods and sauces. When the rich were done with their meals, the sauce-soaked bread was usually given to the poor.<br>  <br>  Most meat was usually served either extremely fresh (birds kept in cages until killed for dinner), or salted and preserved. The spicing of many Renaissance recipes was intended to mask the fact that the meat was extremely salty and had to be soaked and boiled for a long time. Meat was commonly served in ragouts and pottages, or baked into pies. Roasted meats naturally had to be fresh and of good quality, so they were more likely to be found in the homes of nobles. Additionally, only the noble classes had the right to hunt game or to keep a rabbit warren. Fowl were viewed as especially desirable foods for noble tables. Peacocks, swans, herons, and other birds that are no longer popular today,were much sought after for banquets, but were inaccessible to the average person.<br>  <br>  The Renaissance uplifted Europe's culinary arts, especially in Italy, evident in the banquets of Rome's papal court, the Venice of the doges and perhaps most elegantly in the Florence of the Medici. That family's epicurean tastes were transferred to France when Caterina de' Medici wed King|`|2tLswGNuaa	anything to eating, a typical family, the globe theater...|`|f1U8LWBHaa	put peanut butter on your hands and smash them in your mouth|`|lbh880wDaa	yes

Religion and spirituality often go hand-in-hand, but they are not one and the same, and oftentimes one may detract from the other.<br>  In my opinion, it's better to be spiritual. Spirituality is a personal endeavor and is therefore more fulfilling and enlightening. Religion may have the same effects, but it is often inflexible in its doctrines and unwilling to make exceptions for the broad range of philosophies that exist. <br>  <br>  I usually think of religion as "spirituality for dummies." You don't need anyone else to tell you how to relate to your own spirit or soul. Plus, religious institutions are often nothing more than corrupt power-seeking entities fueled by greed and arrogance. If you want to search for deeper meaning in life, or even learn to become a better person, then steer clear of religion.|`|mhDOHoSHaa	religious: believing in one explanation or idea or concept of creation and destruction; strongly agreeing with one religion <br>  spiritual: applying judgment upon ones self; of the soul <br>  Being spiritual means you really commune with your god and seek spiritual cleansing. Religious means you just follow the rules. It is better to be spiritual.|`|OLcXtWQyaa	religious implies an adherence to a fixed set of rules. there is little or no room for growth. spiritual implies an openness to growth.|`|AA11564934	religious means they follow a formalized religion with rules and a place to meet.<br>  <br>  spiritual means they kind of do their own thing with no/few rules|`|1taf83DCaa	Religion involves emotions and externals <br>  <br>  Spirituality involves one's total self in his/her relationship to God.<br>  <br>  I'm a Spiritual person and love the Lord <br>  Religion is christian's down fall it sucks people in and most of the time hurts them deeply<br>  Here is a good link<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.doesgodexist.org/JulAug02/DontBeReligiousBeSpiritual.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.doesgodexist.org/JulAug02/Don...</a>
wtJbmHwBaa	For the first few chapters it is slow yes, but after you get on like page 30 somethin you'll get sucked into it and you won't be able to put it down. I don't want to give it away but yes it does have a love story in it. It has to do with love, trust, being invaded by an 'un-seen' species, and adventure. I fell in love with it and to be honest, I like it better than twilight.|`|4vDBF37waa	It was a good book, nothing spectacular, but it kept me distracted and that's a big factor when i 'm looking for a book.|`|s25Dh5RVaa	It was long and boring and repetitive in the middle. And it was a little difficult to understand in the beginning. Other than that, I thought it was decent.|`|CvkuzcpDaa	welll...i LOVED it!!! i must admit though, at the start of the book i found it really  boring...(!)...and i considered stopping reading it..but my friend told me it got better..so i kept reading it..!! and im sooo happy i did, cause its an amazing book, its about wanda...a 'soul' who is put in to   a girl called melanie's body..(!)...it sounds weird..but its brilliant...anyhoo both of them are in love with Jared...(melanies true love)..and its kinda about their search for him...but its brilliant, you fall in love with the characters...i think its just as good as twilight!! <br>  ya should read it..! hope this helps..xxx|`|pRklTpuFaa	OMG...okay well this book (in my opinion) was brilliant!! near enough as good as twilight!! yes it is a love story but with a twist to it..its like a love triangle!!<br>  when my friend gave it to me i did not want to read it..it looked really gay but woah its brill...the start is really strange and you dont have a clue whats going on but once you get into it its great!! you get to love the characters aswell!!<br>  READ IT!!!<br>  its fab<br>  :D|`|KCxbbPmjaa	it was retarded. don't read it. i wasted a whole 3 hours of my life reading it, and i will never get those precious hours back. don't waste your life reading crap.|`|7UsdV6bzaa	i loved it; its sort of a mature book<br>  <br>  the beginning throws you off but once you get past chapter 4 you fly through the book<br>  <br>  i recommend it for more adult readers|`|4e977e0718d9e088255511707db887fcaa	I like it because it was thought provoking to me. It make me feel some emotions, and because of that it is considered art. You should read it if you feel like reading it. Not everyone likes the same things.

XMV8frmjaa	uhhhh. that's weird. it's easier just to get a tuner. i guess you could go on one of those strings sites and listen to the note. you have to have a good ear, but you could match your pitch with the note being played. also, if you have an electric keyboard at home, you can match your pitch to that at home as well. good luck, but again, i think you should probably just splurge for an actual tuner.<br>  <br>  oh and doesn't the phrase "might guarantee you best answer" contradict itself?|`|0IuQkNszaa	To use an online tuner, you would need a special microphone thingy. Anyway, if you don't have a tuner, use a piano or keyboard. If you do not have access to either of those, find an instrument like a recorder or a bell set to tune to. They're in the key of C. Otherwise, I don't know.

R3UVYaHtaa	no dear its a good question. and who said its stupid , beside using a professional camera wont mean that the user is Professional.<br>  <br>  regarding your Q the 35mm is the mostly used film, there is many kinds of films from 24mm to 12" films and both has its usage. for the 35mm i prefer to use ISO (International Standards Organization) and it indicates to the number of Silver grans on the film.<br>  <br>  you can use the 200 & 400 ISO films. over that (800 - 4000) is for professional use only.|`|AA10264604	35mm film is readily available from 7-11 to wal-mart to costco to CVS pharmacy's etc. You can get it developed at any Wal-Mart or Costco, and a zillion other places. $4-6 bucks a roll to purchase is around right. Developing depends on what you end up with. Costco will develop the film and give you pics. on a cd for another $5-8 bucks. Prints are more, and varies upon size and quantity.|`|VZgAESwLaa	35mm film varies in speed (iso/asa) 800 would be the best for your  application. I think that you would enjoy the camera alot, it is very easy to operate and alot of fun. The processing depends on weather you want 1 hour or 3 day service, double prints, glossy or matte, a photo disk etc. <br>   <br>  I'd suggest 3 day service,single prints, glossy w/ a photo disk. It wont cost over $15-20 @ your local Rite Aid, Target ect...|`|hkoHfoxVaa	you should be able to get it developed anywhere the price depends on how long you want the film developed in and if you want doubles or not

Agw4pXAnaa	I think Nights in Rodanthe or Message in a Bottle might be mine.  However, now that I think about it, The Wedding was wonderful.  I would highly suggest it to anyone!  The Wedding has everything.  It's about Jane, Noah's and Alley's daughter from The Notebook and her husband and their family.  It really is wonderful and a very sweet story.|`|p7FBZWVdaa	Hmm that's a hard one but if I had to choose it would be the rescue I cry in every one of his books!|`|jZNavGmtaa	The Rescue. It's my favorite book of all time. He makes the characters, setting, and story so real and believable. Whenever I read this book I feel like I'm right there with Denise and Taylor. The romance in the book is absolutely beautiful and I cry every time I read it.|`|anLdtPQwaa	My favorite is the Guardian. I loved Mike and Julie's relationship. I thought the way Nicholas Sparks weaved in the whole killer/stalker Richard was really good. It's also the first book that I genuinely cried while reading. I bawled my eyes out when Singer died. I hope I didn't ruin or spoil anything for you though! It's a really good book. I also loved A Walk to Remember. I cried in that one too. Nicholas has a beautiful ability to make you cry for the characters and feel their sadness. Enjoy his books :)|`|Xkas9BG2aa	I've read 2...A Bend in the Road...and the most recent one...The Lucky One.  I just vaguely remember A Bend in the Road but believe I just thought it was okay.  The Lucky One I read after being curious when saw it on the best seller list.  I followed along in the book with having the book cd on in the background.  I've listened to a bunch of book cds and the reader really matters.  In this case the man doing the voice for the main female role didn't do a good job.  I'm thinking I would have liked the book better if I didn't listen to the book cd also.|`|F5rI81Hbaa	Message in a Bottle. Definitely. SO FRIGGEN ROMANTIC.

I do have a Team Jasper shirt, but that was given to me. I agree with the previous posts, they are milking this Twilight thing dry! Its kinda ruining it. I, being a dedicated fan for all these years, am kinda getting annoyed with it to be honest. =[<br>  <br>  You might disagree with my statement but remember its my own opinion.

MCKNkzkLaa	I think you story definitely has some potential, although it was kind of confusing in the beginning for me.<br>  <br>  "I sat, slumped down inside her seat, dreamily. She was in a daze, not listening to a word Miss Hamilton said."<br>  <br>  I really didn't understand what you meant by this. Who are you referring to here? <br>  <br>  "He was the clown of the school – Un-like Miss Hamilton. Suddenly, she turned to me sharply."<br>  <br>  Who is "he"? And you didn't have to put a hyphen between un and like.<br>  <br>  " 'Kayleigh, did you hear what I said!?” She shouted, clearly looking angry. I stutter a bit, before I say…"<br>  <br>  The three dots you put before "say" is unnecesary. Also, I think that "say" should be changed to said. I will revise this sentence a bit and put more detail and imagry. How did the teacher look when she is angry? Did he face turn red? Did her forehead crinkle? Add similies using like or as to comare her to something. It adds more humor and character.<br>  <br>  " 'We’re having a school trip”, Nathan says. That’s just like him, always being the teachers pet. I shrug slightly. For some reason, Miss Hamilton sends me out. Apparently, “I’d been very rude”. But it doesn’t bother me about that, oh no. The worse thing is standing in front of the Head Mistress’s door. I knock then I hear a squeaky-as-a-mouse voice saying come in. I walk in calmly, breathing in and out."<br>  <br>  Where is says "Apparently", there is no need for the comma or the quotation marks. I really like where you say "...head mistress's door". Kind of adds humor. Where you say, "I walked in calmly, breathing in and out", it doesn't really sound right. Everyone breaths. Try revising that by adding a word to express calmness.<br>  <br>  Overall, your story needs a bit of work but it is coming nicely! Try adding a bit more detail about the characters. Nathan gives off a vibe that he is an annoying know-it-all, so talk about how annoying he is. Compare him to a fly, or some other annoying creature or character trait.<br>  <br>  Also, there is a website you can check out called www.webook.com, where you can post your storys and get feedback from writers, editors, etc. I have an account there and they are super nice and give great advice. Happy writing!|`|Fa4BahPgaa	You need to have proper spacing and grammar. <br>  <br>  You keep switching POVs. In one sentence it's in first person, and in others it's third person. Choose just one. <br>  <br>  It's the same thing with your tenses--it keeps switching on and off! In some places it is written like it's happening now, and in other places it's writtten like it already happened. Choose one through the whole story. The only time you can change it is when you do flashbacks and such.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hear a squeaky-as-a-mouse voice saying come in.<br>  ^^ That should say:<br>  <br>  I heard a squeaky-as-a-mouse voice saying, "Come in."<br>  <br>  <br>  As for the actual story, it doesn't pull me in.|`|EXQzhRBjaa	It sounds nice!!!!!
98c18208fe1856919c920371991281c4aa	Lysander loves Hermia, and Hermia loves Lysander. Helena loves Demetrius; Demetrius used to love Helena but now loves Hermia. Egeus, Hermia's father, prefers Demetrius as a suitor, and enlists the aid of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to enforce his wishes upon his daughter. According to Athenian law, Hermia is given four days to choose between Demetrius, life in a nunnery, or a death sentence. Hermia, ever defiant, chooses to escape with Lysander into the surrounding forest.<br>  <br>  Complications arise in the forest. Oberon and Titania, King and Queen of Fairies, are locked in a dispute over a boy whom Titania has adopted. Oberon instructs his servant Puck to bring him magic love drops, which Oberon will sprinkle on the Queen's eyelids as she sleeps, whereupon Titania will fall in love with the first creature she sees upon awakening. Meanwhile, Helena and Demetrius have also fled into the woods after Lysander and Hermia. Oberon, overhearing Demetrius's denouncement of Helena, takes pity upon her and tells Puck to place the magic drops upon the eyelids of Demetrius as well, so that Demetrius may fall in love with Helena. Puck, however, makes the mistake of putting the drops on the eyelids of Lysander instead. Helena stumbles over Lysander in the forest, and the spell is cast; Lysander now desires Helena and renounces a stunned Hermia.<br>  <br>  In the midst of this chaos, a group of craftsmen are rehearsing for a production of "Pyramus and Thisbe," to be played for the Duke at his wedding. Puck impishly casts a spell on Bottom to give him the head of a donkey. Bottom, as luck would have it, is the first thing Titania sees when she awakens; hence, Bottom ends up being lavishly kept by the Queen. Oberon enjoys this sport, but is less amused when it becomes apparent that Puck has botched up the attempt to unite Demetrius and Helena. Oberon himself anoints Demetrius with the love potion and ensures that Helena is the first person he sees; however, Helena understandably feels that she is now being mocked by both Demetrius and Lysander (who is still magically enamored of her).<br>  <br>  Finally, Oberon decides that all good sports must come to an end. He puts the four lovers to sleep and gives Lysander the antidote for the love potion so that he will love Hermia again when they all wake up. Next, Oberon gives Titania the antidote, and the King and Queen reconcile. Theseus and Hippolyta then discover Lysander, Hermia, Helena, and Demetrius asleep in the forest. All return to Athens to make sense of what they think is a strange dream. Likewise, Bottom returns to his players, and they perform "Pyramus and Thisbe" at the wedding feast (which has since become a wedding of three couples). As everyone retires, fairies perform their blessings and Puck delivers a tender epilogue soliloquy.|`|vrcxxRr8aa	It's a play.

DvToP5h7aa	About Gotama<br>  <br>  Gotama Buddha is the first character we encounter in the novel that has achieved enlightenment. The Buddha radiates inner light, peacefulness and grace. When questioned by Siddhartha, he smiles widely and responds calmly. Although Siddhartha feels great love and respect for the Buddha, he must learn independently rather than from someone’s teachings. We never know how Gotama attained enlightenment, but since he agrees with Siddhartha that enlightenment is deeply personal and experiential, it’s safe to say that Gotama didn’t attain enlightenment through studying sacred teachings.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/character/literature/herman-hesse/siddhartha/gotama.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...</a><br>  <br>  ===============================<br>  <br>  About Vasudeva<br>  <br>  Although Vasudeva rarely speaks, he radiates understanding, empathy and love. He is endlessly wise, but attributes his sense of peace and joy to the river on which he lives and works. By cultivating his ability to listen to what the river has to say metaphorically about life, he has gained spiritual insight. These qualities make Vasudeva the perfect teacher for Siddhartha, as he is able to offer guidance, companionship, and support without the rigidity of doctrine and methodology.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/character/literature/herman-hesse/siddhartha/vasudeva.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/character/literatu...</a><br>  <br>  ===============================<br>  <br>  About Siddhartha<br>  <br>  Siddhartha and his spiritual quest is the driving force of the novel.

With the Samanas, he is admired for learning quickly and practicing the exercises with focus and energy.

Agw4pXAnaa	I LOVE Sookie!!!! I've been reading those books for about for about four years now.  They beat Twilight all to heck.  Charlene Harris is a great writer.  She really knows how to fit it "all" in a book and do it tactfully (suspense, romance, mystery, sex).  I just finished Club Dead and I'm currently reading Dead to the World. You can get a box set of those books from Barnes and Noble (that's what I have).  I've also read some of her Grave Sight series, their great too.  I've read Twilight too (*coughs, sucks b@lls,lol*), it seems like Meyers actually tried to rip off Harris (who started her series first) off and did a poor job of it.  You really can't put Harris' books down once you start, have fun and enjoy!!!<br>  <br>  (Harris is from the same state as me, woohoo, one up for Arkansas,lol)<br>  <br>  **Trust me, get the box set, you are going to want to keep reading in the series and you will save alot of money if you get it.|`|f58b2b418157b16c12987703e17e6ab7aa	Charlaine Harris is a brilliant author and has learned economy of words without taking away from the storyline. <br>  <br>  Even tho the Twilight series is aimed at young people, good writing shouldn't be sacrificed.

Mdk7DmiAaa	The main idea of the Lowell System is precision, accuracy, efficiency, and repeatability.  The system created a manufacturing working environment free of chaotic wasted energy and movement.  This replaced the piece work system seen in the 'sweat shop' textile factories of the past.  Along with better working conditions a reform movement by workers provided for the first union type activities.  Later Henry Ford and others would use an assembly line like organization patterned after the gains seen using the Lowell System.  So increased work productivity, better working conditions, organized labor, and a future of assembly line work.  This was the beginning of the Industrial Revolution.

iNXqiDIYaa	Toussaint Louverture played a key role in what was the first successful attempt by a slave population in the Americas and the world to throw off the yoke of Western colonialism. He defeated armies of three imperial powers: Spain, France, and Great Britain. The success of the Haitian Revolution had enduring effects on shaking the institution of slavery throughout the New World. Haiti became the second independent republic in the Western Hemisphere.<br>  <br>  After being captured by the French general Leclerc, on the ship to France, Toussaint Louverture warned his captors that the rebels would not make his mistake in the following words: "[B]y overthrowing me you have killed only the trunk of the tree of liberty of the black people, it will grow back by the roots cause they are deep and numerous."
MGEYaehVaa	1)  The passing of time<br>  <br>  4)  Sonnet 60 is acknowledged as one of Shakespeare's greatest because it deals with the universal concerns of time and its passing. In the sonnet, time is symbolized by concrete images. For example, the opening two lines present a simile in which time is represented by "waves" and "minutes": "Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore, / So do our minutes hasten to their end"; here, death is "the pebbled shore" — another concrete image.<br>  <br>  In the second quatrain, the poet laments time's unfairness. A child — "Nativity" — is born and, over time, matures to adulthood, and yet the adult now dreads the maturation process as he grows increasingly older and thus reaches the point of death, or the end of time. Time, which gives life, now takes it away: "And Time that gave doth now his gift confound."<br>  <br>  The antithesis in lines 9 through 12 is between the aging poet and the youth's good looks. The poet warns, "Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth / And delves the parallels in beauty's brow." In other words, the young man currently is beautiful, but "parallels" — wrinkles — will eventually appear, as they have on the poet. However much the young man and the poet would like beauty to reside forever on the youth's face, "nothing stands but for his [time's] scythe to mow."<br>  <br>  Nonetheless, the poet promises to immortalize the youth's good looks before time's wrinkles appear on his face: "And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand, / Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand." Unlike the poet's promise in Sonnet 19, this assurance does not include giving the young man eternal beauty. Even more, the "scythe" in line 12 recalls Sonnet 12's concluding couplet: "And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defense / Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence." Clearly the poet is no longer concerned that the young man have a child to ensure the immortality of his beauty. Now, the poet's own sonnets are the only security the youth needs to gain eternal worth.

The mother and daughter are best friends, they have a lot of fun. One day, the mother gets really sick, but she refuses to go see a doctor. So the daughter has to take care of her mother, and isn't sure if she should tell somebody. Take it from there.<br>  <br>  2- The girl's parents were really young when she was born, so they had her adopted. She lives with a nice enough couple, but one day, she meets her mother randomly. They become friends, not knowing who they are, but then, the mother slowly realizes that she's her daughter. The girl has to make the choice between her real parents and adopted ones.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try to make it original. You can get the relationship from Gilmore Girls, but don't make it too much like it.|`|EJQlo9Nyaa	hmmm....maybe the daughter never knew her mom and her dad died so she is living with someone else (aunt or uncle?!) then she goes out somewhere and bumps into a lady and they start talking and find out they are mother daughter....then she takes her back and they live together and are happy, best friends, THE END=)<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luckk!!!|`|k020tpALaa	nothing because a good book is Original and not based off an old tv show so don't write it ok|`|BOvnHxPFaa	They start out happy. Like a mother and daughter should be. Mother was a detective, and the daughter was a highschool student. They're best friends. Then, the daughter got invited to a party her "friend' hosted.

I read it and was amazed, and then i gave it to all my friends and they loved it too. Here's a summary: <br>  <br>  Katsa has been able to kill a man with her bare hands since she was eight; she's a Graceling, one of the rare people in her land born with an extreme skill. As niece of the king, she should be able to live a life of privilege, but Graced as she is with killing, she is forced to work as the king's thug. <br>  She never expects to fall in love with beautiful Prince Po. She never expects to learn the truth behind her Grace--or the terrible secret that lies hidden far away. . .a secret that could destroy all seven kingdoms with words alone. With elegant, evocative prose and a cast of unforgettable characters, debut author Kristin Cashore creates a mesmerizing world, a death-defying adventure, and a heart-racing romance that will consume you, hold you captive, and leave you wanting more.<br>  <br>  ------<br>  <br>  Prince Po (yeah, weird name, I know, but when you find out its origin it's actually really awesome) also has a Grace, and it's AWESOME. Plus he's super handsome.<br>  <br>  And another good book is The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins:<br>  <br>  Twenty-four are forced to enter. Only the winner survives. <br>  <br>  In the ruins of a place once known as North America lies the nation of Panem, a shining Capitol surrounded by 12 outlying districts. Each year, the districts are forced by The Capitol to send one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to participate in The Hunger Games, a brutal and terrifying fight to the death --- televised for all of Panem to see. Survival is second nature for 16-year-old Katniss Everdeen, who struggles to feed her mother and younger sister by secretly hunting and gathering beyond the fences of District 12. When Katniss steps in to take the place of her sister in the Hunger Games, she knows it may be her death sentence. If she is to survive, she must weigh survival against humanity and life against love.|`|IsU8ZPf3aa	I'd Tell You I Love You, But Then I'd Have to Kill You by Ally Carter<br>  sequel- Cross My Heart and Hope to Spy by Ally Carter<br>  Here's a summary:<br>  Cammie Morgan is a student at the Gallagher Academy For Exceptional Young Women. It is a school for geniuses, technically, but everyone in the building (and very, very few people outside it) knows what's really going on. These girls are being trained to be spies.<br>  <br>  Of course, no one's forcing them to take up epsionage for a living once they graduate, but it's pretty easy to figure out what they're meant to do; they study code breaking, martial arts, and, once they're sophomores (like Cammie and her friends), Covert Operations. And it's not every school that had an alert system for when visitors come that hides every trace of what people do there every day and turns it into a regular boarding school for rich girls (the way the people in the surrounding town think the Gallagher Academy is).<br>  <br>  Speaking of the people in town, Cammie actually meets one of them on her first Covert Operations mission! The mission does not go as well as it could, but something miraculous does happen: Cammie, who hasn't really known any boys for years, and is known for her ability to become invisible at school (a compliment at a school like hers), is noticed by a boy.<br>  <br>  Josh is a rather cute boy, too. And the fact that he notices Cammie makes them practically soul mates already! Of course, things are never as simple as they seem. Even though Cammie and her friends can hack into Josh's email and implant a tracker in his shoe to make sure he's not trying to infiltrate the school through her, there's something Cammie isn't sure she can pull off: being a normal girl, especially when Josh can't find out the truth about Cammie's life. Can she and Josh be together, despite all of the obstacles in their way?<br>  <br>  <br>  happy reading|`|ZfWUK5x3aa	Confessions of a Shopaholic.

Joseph Turner, John Constable, Ben Nicholson, Gillian Ayres, Paul Nash, David Tress, are all British artists, but French painters have loved this subject, including the Impressionists and Post Impressionists. Americans include John Marin, Edward Hopper, Georgia O' keeffe, Andrew Wyeth, Charles Sheeler. As an artist, you just need to connect with work you really like and it can fuel your own imagination.

If you don't want to paint the whole thing concentrate on a small section.<br>  Experiment with different styles of painting and different materials. Try getting some small peices of canvas and working on those so you can stick them into your sketch book.<br>  I especially like doing really quick, messy sketches of landscapes. Use either a medium graphite stick or an ink pen and just draw what you see.<br>  Don't rub out "mistakes" as these can really add to a piece of work.<br>  Have fun :) :) Hope this helps!|`|QMjBnEMQaa	Apart from the bucolic examples, try urban landscapes, industrial landscapes, docks, housing estates... there's so many kinds to chose between. If you wanted to try surrealist ideas, there's always the landscape of the mind or emotions, difficult to observe I'll admit, but landscape of the body or face could be a start. Consider the use of silhouette or using stencils/rollers to create skyscraper effects...

A K1000 is a workhorse, and a good one in good working order should last quite a while. I'd take it somewhere and get it cleaned and adjusted just in case those poorly exposed rolls are really from the camera. That camera is at least 17 years old, and if he's had it in storage for some time it'll need the service. The lens and flash only have minimal value. The camera is what's worth the investment. Ask him if he also has the 50mm Pentax lens that probably came with it when he bought it new. Those were pretty good lenses, and a good normal lens is always good to have around.

uP9SQhkcaa	Personally, I think that your story isn't good for suicide. What makes a plot good is how the characters progress throughout the book/story. In your story, I think that the main character should find something in her life that is good, and then realize her life is fine and she can be happy or something. You get what I'm trying to say? If a book ends where the person is in the same situation as the beginning, a crappy life with nothing to look forward to, what was the point in reading it? I like suicide endings if it fits the story. But for you, I think you should switch it up a bit. <br>  <br>  Love,<br>  Alice Danielle|`|32g69LSZaa	The Awakening by Kate Chopin ends in suicide, and it's an amazing novel.

Shakespeare was very interested in the relationships of children with their parents, in this case, Hamlet with his father, his stepfather, and his mother.

ZB9zkbxxaa	In January 2001, Fusient Media Ventures, led by Eric Bischoff, announced they had bought WCW. The deal was contingent on the Turner networks keeping Nitro on Monday and Thunder on TBS on Wednesday. When Jamie Kellner took over as CEO of Turner Broadcasting, he removed all WCW programming from the network.<br>  <br>  With no national television outlet to air the shows, Fusient dropped their offer to purchase the promotion. As a stipulation in the Nash/Hall lawsuit the WWF filed against Turner Networks, WWF had right of first refusal on WCW and paid around $3 million to acquire certain assets, including the trademarks, logos, and video library. On March 23, 2001, Vince McMahon officially purchased World Championship Wrestling.[10]<br>  <br>  Twenty-five wrestler contracts were included in the sale;[10] however, most of the main event-level stars were contracted directly to parent company AOL Time Warner instead of WCW, and thus AOL Time Warner was forced to continue to pay many of the wrestlers for years.<br>  <br>  TNT did allow a final Nitro show to air from Panama City Beach, Florida which had been scheduled for the following Monday on March 26. It featured segments with Vince McMahon and the WWF stars live from RAW in Cleveland, Ohio during the show. The final WCW World Heavyweight Championship match for the show and the company saw Booker T unify the WCW World Heavyweight Championship and WCW United States Heavyweight Championship by defeating Scott Steiner.<br>  <br>  The main event featured Sting defeating Ric Flair with the Scorpion Deathlock as a culmination of their trademark feud, then both men embraced one another at the match's conclusion. This was a direct parallel to the very first Nitro, where Sting vs. Flair was also the main event.<br>  <br>  The end was a Raw-Nitro simulcast in which Shane McMahon appeared, claiming that he had purchased (kayfabe) WCW from under Vince, setting up the ill-fated Invasion storyline. The last Nitro drew a 3.0 rating. The final ratings tally in 253 head-to-head showdowns was: 158 wins for Raw (including 122 straight from November 1998 until the war ended), 110 for Nitro, and three ties.<br>  <br>  Earlier that month, ECW owner Paul Heyman had begun an announcing contract with WWF, officially marking the end of ECW as a functional business. Thus, WWF was now the sole professional wrestling company with nationwide coverage in the United States.

AA10729675	They discovered it much too late.  Once the Pergamon kings called on Romans all the time for help, for complaining against Antiochus (all of them Antiochus III, IV etc) against the Antigonids, against the Greeks etc, onece Athens called on the Romans against the Antigonids and the Spartiates, etc... and the Romans little by little invaded Greece, then and only then did they understand that they had made a mistake and that they were Greeks, refined, advanced, in front of severe, strict brutes like Flamininus (who pretended he loved Greece and was refined) and Paulus Aemilius and when they had no Macedonians to save Greece, no Seleucids to revive Greece, and the Macedonians in Egypt were weakened and also invaded by the Romans, only then did they understand they were all Greek.  Too late.  No games, no language could save them.  It was at the end of the Hellenistic Period:  30 BC.|`|qgs155HNaa	They believed that they had blood in common too.  According to their myths, after the Great Flood, the world was repopulated by Deucalion and Pyrrha by tossing stones ('the bones of their mother' Earth) over their shoulders.  But they also later on had a child in the usual way, Hellen, the ancestor of all the Hellenes.  He had three sons, Dorus, Aeolus and Xuthus (who married an Athenian princess named Creusa and had a son Ion).  These were the ancestors of the three ethnic and linguistic subdivisions of the Hellenes:  Dorians, Aeolians and Ionians.  If you were a Greek, you should be able to trace your ancestry to one of these three.  Otherwise you were just stone people. It was not just idle talk when Aristotle defined the "polis" as a national family.  When everybody lives in the same valley for a bunch of generations and intermarry, everybody IS related by blood more or less.  "6 degrees of separation"

This time her protagonist, 12-year-old Eva, goes into hiding with her whole family, but no place is truly safe. Their first refuge is shared with another family; the protectors worry that having so many people poses too great a risk, and it is Eva's family that must leave. Their next hosts are a man who tells anti-Semitic jokes (he takes in Jews only because he hates the Germans), and his wife, who is having an affair. The wife's lover, hoping to have the husband arrested, plans to inform the Germans about the Jews in the house, and Eva's family flees in the nick of time. Soon Eva and her younger sister are separated from their parents and forced to cope with acutely frightening circumstances. The precariousness of the hiding places, the dangers of moving from one to another and the girls' unnatural existence within them are thrown into sharp relief as Vos distills each scene to its most telling moments."<br>  <br>  See Ida Vos' other books like "Hide and Seek"<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hide-Seek-Ida-Vos/dp/0140369082/ref=pd_sim_b_3" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Hide-Seek-Ida-Vos/...</a>|`|3Fma3URSaa	Anne Frank.|`|42Snaj8jaa	I'm not sure, but it sounds like The Diaries of Ann Franke

What is the basis for Darwin's theory of the survival of the fittest? He has none, and he didn't want to add the possibility of an intelligent designer that would prompt evolving forms into wanting to survive. Darwin doesn't explain why would the universe from mere chance and randomness evolve an ego, an intellect and a consciousness with a strong sense of being an individual and having an "I." Darwin's theory just doesn't make sense, and yet it's forced on school children like it is so scientific and so rational. <br>  <br>  I think God is behind why life forms want to survive because behind the evolution of form is the evolution of God's own consciousness that God's own infinite consciousness that manifested at the very beginning of creation depends on.

Certainly, for this process to occur undirected, by chance, from non-living materials requires quite a suspension of disbelief.<br>    Could evolution have been divinely guided so as to leap past some of these genetic hurdles by invoking miraculous intervention?  It's possible, but not something I embrace.<br>    Interpreting evolution atheistically, which is often the case, requires one to accept that matter created mind or matter is mind, and that's a prospect too outlandish for me to entertain.|`|1taf83DCaa	I believe things change over centuries<br>  Example: some of the dinosaurs are now smaller <br>  Here is a good link<br>  it's a Museum with a lot of information<br>   it's an on line museum all on evolution<br>  I think you'll enjoy it <br>  the pictures are great|`|7aK81hsbaa	what's wrong with divinely guided evolution? that's how i see it. so we're evolved, ok, who started the evolution? creation and evolution are not mutually exclusive at all.|`|AA11550519	It's real. I mean, there's nothing else that adequately explains the fossil record! The process may not be very well understood, but the principals (random mutation + nonrandom selection) are crystal clear...no bull.|`|FY4cCjsOaa	You're likely to run into two different notions of what "evolution" means.<br>  <br>  Strictly speaking, the theory of evolution merely states that all species of life on earth are distantly related; if you could trace their ancestry back far enough (and it might be a very long way) any two species would turn out to have some ancestral species in common. That doesn't just apply to humans and chimpanzees, it also applies to humans and trees or humans and bacteria.<br>  <br>  The evidence for this is very strong, but most of the really absolutely convincing data became available in the last half-century with the discovery of the manner in which DNA is encoded and the way it governs the development of living creatures. Phylogenetic trees, residual unused encodings on chromosomes, and the remarkable fact that the code is completely arbitrary but nearly the same for all species all point to common descent.<br>  <br>  There is also what some of us call "evolutionism": it may be defined several ways, but it seems to include the notion that somehow this fact proves something about the validity of religious belief, or about the validity of some notions of social organization. While evolution is certainly a fact that ought not to be denied by any belief system, these extensions are not so respectable; they generally involve very bad science of the sort that extends conclusions by metaphor to conditions in which they don't apply, and usually are a matter of invoking "science" in support of some unscientific prejudice.<br>  <br>  With respect to the Bible's creation myth, evolutionists typically bolster their case by insisting on a very limited and literal reading of the story. That puts them in agreement with fundamentalists and with practically no one else, including Bible scholars and literary theorists, on how such texts should be understood.<br>  <br>  With respect to social theories, evolutionists typically apply "survival of the fittest" (a term first applied to it by a noted scientist wandering away from scientific respectability) to proposals for favoring competition over cooperation, ignoring the abundant examples of cooperation as a survival strategy in the evolutionary record. This "social Darwinism" was actually around before Darwin; you can find references to its rhetoric in Dickens' writings well before Darwin published.<br>  <br>  I accept evolution but reject evolutionism, much as I believe in creation but reject creationism.|`|Jpjzk6Ecaa	Okay, I saw this q and just had to answer it even though I have no time cuz of hw...<br>  I am FOR evolution.  I believe it does exist mainly because of the scientific research and discovery of fossils of ape/human skulls.<br>  <br>  I understand that the religious view of Adam and Eve brings up a good argument, but I still argue that religious has no physical/substantial proof what the religion says.  Science, on the other hand, has real proof that we can touch and see, fossils of how our skulls evolved.|`|4e977e0718d9e088255511707db887fcaa	The following is MY opinion, you can agree or disagree:<br>  Evolution exists.

Bear in mind that there is controversy every century CE as to when the century begins. Was it 2000 or 2001?<br>  <br>  Maybe work on it this way: A century is 100 years, so what was the first century BCE? The year 1 BCE came right before 1 CE.

At this point all humanity is judged individually. On that day only we are sent into heaven or hell.<br>  There is no entrance to either until this happens.<br>  <br>  However,the consequences of our actions can not be foreseen until the game is over. A person who we think has done evil may have done us a good turn over a longer period of time. Suppose someone had murdered Hitler before he became the Nazi leader; when he was unknown in Vienna. OMG! All of the Christians would be running around screaming blue murder. "An eye for ..." Hang him.<br>  <br>  To get around this anomaly the "limbo" concept was created by medieval theologians. When we die we enter limbo where humanity is held in "rapture" by the vision of the glorified figure of Jesus.<br>  <br>  At the end of days (fanfare) the sky opens and Jesus is resurrected and the judgement is passed down. The people who are shown to have done evil in the history of all time are cast into the lake of fire and brimstone. You may be one of those who are sent downstairs.

He extended Christianity into some pagan parts of Europe and encouraged learning and literacy, which were in very shaky condition.  When he encountered an illiterate priest conducting a service, he often went up to the lectern and read the lessons himself.  In fact his reign and the period just after it were known as the Carolingian Renaissance.|`|AA11071860	Most important - he revitalized the Roman Catholic Church and was christian as the Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire.

No one in Western Europe did since its collapse. He also was coronated "emperor" by the Pope of Byzantine. He also had many policies, like using counts to control local provinces. These counts had interests of their own and abused power, so Charlemagne created the missi dominici, sort of a spy, to keep tabs on the counts. His many campaigns were reminiscent of the Romans, and he was the only one who controlled almost as much as the Western Roman Empire.

At least, they could not be killed and the criminal left unpunished.|`|NYU37jfGaa	A citizen woman in Athens was  considered to be perpetually under the gaurdianship of a man, usually the father, or, if he were dead, the male next-of-kin.  Upon marriage, a woman passed into the guardianship of her husband in most matters, with the important limitation that her father, or whoever else ahd given her in marriage, ahd the right to dissolve the marriage.  If the husband predeceased the wife, the guardianship of her dowry and perhaps of her person passed to her sons if they were of age or to their guaardians.  If a widow had no children she would return to the power of her original guardian or his heirs.  A widow was protected by the archon, who could prosecute offenders in her behalf.<br>  <br>  Custom dictated that a dowry commensurate with the father's economic status be provided for a woman's maintenance.  A father would not raise more daughters than he could provide with dowries, and larger dowries tended to attract wealthier and more desirable suitors.  In cases where the father had not shown proper foresight or had suffered reverses, dowries were contributed from other sources.  The wealthy frequently dowered their poorer relatives.  We are told without further explanation that the law required that dowries be provided for poor girls of even passably attractive appearance, and a few times Athens provided dowries for daughters of men who had served the state.  <br>  <br>  The Athenians were protective of their women.   A woman's dowry was to remain intact throughout her lifetime and to be used for her support, neither the father, nor th ehusband, nor the woman herself could legally dispose of it.  Upon marriage, the dowry passed from the guardianship of the father to that of the groom.  The groom coul duse the principle but was required to to maintain his wife from the cinome of her dowry, computed at 18 percent annually.  Upon divorce, the husband was required to return the dowry to his ex-wife's guardian, or pay interest at 18 percent.  Thus her support would continue to be provided for, and with her dowry intact, she would be eligible for remarriage.  A widow, especially if she had increased her property through inheritance from her late husband, would also be an attractive candidate for remarriage.<br>  <br>  Divorce was easily attainable, either by mutual consent or through action on behalf of either one of the spouses, and there was no stigma attached.  When the wife wished a divorce, she needed the intercession of her father or some other male citizen to bring the case before the archon.<br>  <br>  Since children were produced to perpetuate the father's house, they were the property of their father, and remained in his house when marriages were dissolved through death and also probably in cases of divorce.  The divorcee or widow was thus entirely free to remarry and to bear children to a new husband.<br>  <br>  Since citizen girls married young and did not participate in public life, they were not given the same education as boys.  They were taught domestic skills by their mothers.  The most important of these were spinning and weaving, all women were supposed to provide cloth for the family, and a wife would be expected to make cloth herself as well as supervising the work of the slaves.<br>  <br>  Well born Athenian women were expected to stay at home and not mix socially with men.  When men gave parties, the only women present would be hetarea (high class prostitutes, famous for their wit and education) and the flute girls, musicians who would entertain the company.  Aspasia, who was a hetarea, became th emistres of Pericles, who ruled Athens during its Golden Age, and was said to have written some of his best speeches.<br>  <br>  Religion was the major sphere of public life in which women participated, sometimes playing an important role.  The festival of the Panathenaea, celebrating the birthday of Athena, was the most important festival in Athens, and women played a prominent role in it.  Young girls called kanephori carried sacred baskets in the procession, and men and women mingled freely.  Every fourth year at the GReater Panathenaea a new peplos (robe) was woven for the the statue of Athena in the Parthenon.  The weaving and embroidering of the robe was done by Athenian women, who would go in procession to present the goddes with her new robe.|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	Women in Athens were expected to stay at home and leave all decicion making to the men. They were also expected to dress "correctly" which meant covered from head to toe. In practice they were chattels- no rights. Despite the head to toe dresses and restrictive laws on sex they were considered as sexually promiscuous<br>  <br>  By contrast the women of Sparta dressed as they wished (and quite often went naked- just as the men). However every Spartan (man, woman or child) always wore a sword or a knife and could use it- and Spartan women were known for their chastity

It may be exactly what you wanted, but it's not my cup o' tea.  The subject's head is chopped off at the top of the picture, and under her leg is just wasted space.  Easy fix for this, center and snap it again or just do a little cropping above the leg.  Go ahead and chop some of that extra black off the right side while you're at it.    It's not bad, but not great either.  Afew tweaks and it could be better.

v70p2kgWaa	Believe it or not few books written for pleasure are ever actually written at a high school or college level.  Most young adult and adult books average out around a 7th grade readability (and its a rule of thumb in literary fields to shoot for this).  This is the reason why I hate when teachers that require students to read based on grade level lexiles (a type of readability standard) because most book just aren't written that way.  While books might end up being easy to read, it's more to the point to look for books that interest you than it is anything else.<br>  <br>  <br>  Fahrenheit 451- Ray Bradbury<br>  The Outsiders- S. E. Hinton<br>  The Chocolate War- Robert Cormier<br>  Hatchet- Gary Paulsen<br>  The House of the Scorpion- Nancy Farmer<br>  I Am the Messenger- Markus Zusak|`|tL73W0VZaa	I had the same problem at your age. My reading level was the same as yours, but I hadn't yet fallen in love with literature, (now, "Jane Eyre" is one of my favorite books, and I'm working my way through "War and Peace"). I started browsing through the adult science fiction section, but most of the books I came across were quite graphic, and pretty disgusting. <br>  <br>  You might want to try Garth Nix's novels, he has several mature young adult series, and I used to love his "Old Kingdom" trilogy. They are pretty gory, but not as bad as some of the adult sci-fi. Johnathan Stroud also has a series called the "Bartimaeus Trilogy"  which isn't violent at all, and is very funny. "The Gemma Doyle Trilogy" by Libba Bray has some mature content, but the characters are much more three-dimensional than in most young adult fantasy. <br>  <br>  If you liked "Lord of the Flies" you might want to try "Animal Farm" or even "1984" by George Orwell. They are both considered classics, but they are short, and don't take place in the 1800s. That's all I can think of right now, I hope I've helped.
Rm9mII46aa	Yes, that is an opinion. Things that take a side of an argument are opinions. So, when you read the book, figure out the two sides to each argument they are making and then see which side they are taking. <br>  <br>  So, in your example, the other side of the argument would be that genetic engineering has NOT improved treatment of diabetes.

The French, English and Italians were mostly self-sufficient before the war and because the war did not take significant land out of agricultural production these countries were spared the worst deprivations of the war.  Germany and Austria were not self-sufficient in food production before the war and a successful British blockade of German shipping force the German and Austrian civilian populations into extreme want by the end of the war.  Perhaps the countries who suffered worst were Belgium and Russia.  Belgium had tried to stay neutral but was invaded by Germany and the war badly ravaged the county and crippled it's economy.  By the end of the war Belgium required a considerable amount of aid just to keep it's people from starving.  Russia fared perhaps the worst of all the combatant countries from WWI.  The Russians were badly mauled by the German army, forced into a separate peace with a significant loss of valuable agricultural land.  The war led to the Russian revolution of 1918 which devastated the country and led to widespread death and economic collapse.

Now, I know that you will have been trying to avoid something as simple and as obvious as that, but in so doing, you have encountered another problem, that of contrivance. The word 'severeth' is not a common one ('though it is a certainly a legitimate one) and hence seems unnatural and forced.

fMfBAgOUaa	no, that will not be the same. Wattage and loudness are related, but its not a direct equation. You can put as many speakers as you want on a 15 watt amp, and it will still only put out 15 watts. It would probably even get quieter after a certain number of speakers, because it wouldnt be able to power them all. What is more important that watts is the efficiency of the speaker(s). A 15watt amp with a high efficiency speaker vs a 30watt amp with a low efficiency speaker, the 15 watt will be louder. How you can relate wattage to loudness though, is (assuming the same speakers are used), for every time you double wattage, loudness only increases by 3db. 12db is about what humans percieve as "twice as loud". so the loudness difference between a 15 and a 30 watt amp will not be much, and barely be noticeable. When you do the math, a 60watt amp is approximately twice as loud as a 15 watt amp (assuming they have the same speakers, of course.), 240watts is twice as loud as 60... etc. Rather than worry about loudness, which is not important at all with such a small amp, look at sound quality. Which amp sounds better to you? Get the one you like more, not the one that is louder.

There would be no need for multi thousand dollar cameras and lights if all you had to do was put any old photo in Photoshop and it magically be "professional" looking.<br>  <br>  steve|`|35f126768433fb7bc9a5037cf6657dbcaa	i have photoshop but i don't do much with it...i try to get the shot right in the camera, <br>  if you want professional looking images, learn to shoot like a professional. take a class or two at your community college, join a camera club, and most of all take lots and lots of pictures. practice practice practice and don't be afraid of mistakes and critiques.|`|razhTFIiaa	You might be able to find a older version of photoshop for cheap... <br>  <br>  If you aren't interested in that.

AflFFMHtaa	Macbeth is a pretty complex play, and there are several different themes involved. The theme of appearance vs reality is good, but I prefer the one about Nature. <br>  <br>  For appearance vs reality, Lady Macbeth says:<br>  "Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,<br>  Your hand, your tongue. Look like the innocent flower,<br>  But be the serpent under it."<br>  <br>  This quote is closely related to whether Macbeth is fully responsible for his actions. Is Lady Macbeth considering herself to be the serpent beneath Macbeth, who is the flower?|`|BkQ3BtaDaa	A fundamental moment in the whole play is Act 1 Scene 3, where Macbeth and Banquo meet the three witches as they are returning from the battle. The witches' prophecy sets off a chain of events that are basically the whole story of the play.<br>  <br>  Maybe the night of Duncan's murder could also be considered vital. Macbeth and Lady Macbeth's greed and corruption caused the whole destruction of the natural order of the world, as God's Temple here on Earth, Duncan, was no more. The events that follow essentially describe the state of Scotland and its citizens after that.<br>  <br>  There are many themes developed throughout the play. Appearance versus Reality, as you mentioned, is a critical one. The contrast between what is Good and what is Evil, and its effects on the natural world, people and their actions, is also an important one.

O7KR3tgjaa	If you're a teen, then I'd suggest the House of Night series by PC and Kristin Cast. They are not as well-written as the Twilight saga though, but the plot is addictive. Warning: there's a lot of teen drama in this that'll make you want to slam your head into the wall. But it's definitley worth the read.<br>  <br>  The Vampire Diaries (the 4 books are separated into two) by LJ Smith are great, especially with the new covers. The plot is similar to Twilight at first, but gets its own unique vibe later on. <br>  <br>  One of my absolute fave series is the Daughters of te Moon by Lynne Ewing. She's a brilliant writer of teen novels-- always very creative. She's the reason why I read Twilight! The story revolves around 4 and later, 5 girls who possess powers given by the goddess Selene. They must use them to fight the Atrox, the darkest power of all. There's, action, romance, everything you could hope for.<br>  <br>  Oh, and if you've read Artemis Fowl by Eoin Colfer, you know what a great writer he/she is. I really liked The Supernaturalists; the book pulls you into a futuristic society where orphans are treated as lab animals and one boy, Cosmo Hill escapes in the hopes of finding a place where he belongs. All while he tries to survive.<br>  <br>  Books NOT to pick up: The Uglies series by Scott Westerfeld. It's a man's take on how teens (okay, teen girls) are vain, misguided, and have no brains. And all that they care about is a medical procedure in which they get sliced and ground into barbie dolls when they turn 15. I mean, come on! This is pure bull. The man cannot emphathize enough to write a good book about and it just left me smacking myself in the face for reading it. Yeah, I finished it but did I like it? NOOOO. <br>  <br>  Now, if you're an adult and you want something more mature (or maybe when you've turned 18 or whatever), a little or a lot more sexual, then go for books by Kresley Cole, Sherrilyn Kenyon, JR Ward, Alexandra Ivy, and Gena Showalter. They write great paranormal romance novels that's make you laugh, cry, pulse jump, heart stop, all at once.<br>  <br>  Some of my favorites include the Lords of the Underworld and also the Tales of Atlantis(?) series by Showalter, Kiss of a Demon King by Kresley Cole, and some of the Dark Hunters books by Kenyon. Once again, I emphasize that they are R-rated-- so brace yourself.|`|AA12065466	harry potter<br>  <br>  tokio hotel is wow|`|Fa4BahPgaa	Wicked Lovely by Melissa Marr<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say it's amazing, but it's worth reading.<br>  <br>  The "House of Night" series.

u0zEutf1aa	No, I'm not. I can understand why people wouldn't like some of the books I like. Les Miserables, for instance...it's a wonderful book, but some people would just want Hugo to get on with the story, as opposed to rambling on about the sewers when we want to know  what happened to Marius and Jean Valjean. (I actually thought the ramblings were rather interesting, but I digress). I am annoyed with people who simply say, "This book sucks!" and give no reason; however, it still doesn't personally offend me. What bothers me most of all is when people act like their opinion is the only correct one and don't even pay attention when I explain my opinions. Again, I get annoyed, but I don't take it as a personal insult.<br>  <br>  ?M?|`|ncSd9jXDaa	uggh i hate those books...<br>  <br>  lol jk, i only read the Great Gatsby and that was pretty good. i need to read it again<br>  <br>  <br>  you should read The Alchemist, that book is really good. its an easy book to read too, its like an 8 hour book|`|Fa4BahPgaa	Not really.

I mind them mocking or dissing it, though.|`|x08oohwpaa	I don't get offended, I just feel sorry for those people.  I love reading and think people who can love a book are lucky.  Everyone who reads a book sees it differently in their mind, when people watch tv everyone sees the same thing.   <br>  <br>  Reading is one of the few forms of entertainment that you can really put part of yourself into, so when people reject a book you love it can easily feel like they are rejecting you.|`|DF7wGWWKaa	If you are Stephanie Meyer, then you get offended every time your book is not praised. The only people who get offended about other people's opinions are those that can't handle the real world. <br>  <br>  On the other hand, if there is no reasonable basis for the mocking, then that is just the idiocy of your peers showing.

He had been made a Justice of the Peace for Washington DC by John Adams, and confirmed by the Senate during the last four days of the Adams Administration.  But John Marshall, who was then Secretary of State (and within one day of being named Chief Justice of the United States) sealed the Commission--which was never delivered to Marbury.  When Jefferson came into office, he ordered his new Secretary of State, James Madison NOT to deliver it.  Madison obeyed.

A life or death situation. Drive the story with this and have the aspects of the Depression as the peripheral inputs. Remember, they didn't call it the great depression until it was over. Her father was a wealthy investor who lost every thing in the fall of the market. He had to take a job working on some factory job. A job that was very dangerous. He had heard the grievances from the workers when he was rich but safety measures cost money. He is severely injured and she has to work in these conditions to feed the family. She witnesses people getting hurt even killed. She witnesses children being exploited in the labor force. She grows up to lead the advocacy for labor reform. It's just an idea to get you going.
46fouwFfaa	No, they usually will not come to believe in G-d. There would be no purpose for language if the child does not live with another person or being. A child who was not raised by adult humans would often act like whatever animal did raise them or if they grew up alone in the wild, did not wear clothing, speak any language, and behaved like a wild animal.<br>  <br>  A baby will die if it does not receive human contact, even if it somehow still received food and shelter (warmth). An example of babies not being able to survive without human contact or attention are the Romanian orphans during the war. The very few that did survive grew to be mentally handicapped or "retarded". American psychologists were intrigued by the case and took in a few orphans. Those who were adopted by loving families that would physically and mentally stimulate them would grow up to be healthy and intelligible. <br>  <br>  Children who were raised or taken care of by animals or grew up alone are called "feral children". They are rare but they do exist. Here's a website that lists some feral children raised by animals and their story:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.feralchildren.com/en/children.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.feralchildren.com/en/children...</a><br>  <br>  There is a story about a Nigerian boy named Bello who was raised by chimpanzees after his parents abandoned him 6 months after his birth. He was found by other humans when he was 2 years old and he acted like a chimp:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.feralchildren.com/en/showchild.php?ch=bello" rel="nofollow">http://www.feralchildren.com/en/showchil...</a><br>  <br>  An Indian boy named Dina was raised by wolves after living in an orphanage. Like all feral children, he exhibited behaviour typical of the type of animal that he lived with:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.feralchildren.com/en/showchild.php?ch=sanichar" rel="nofollow">http://www.feralchildren.com/en/showchil...</a><br>  <br>  Here is a list of children who grew up alone, isolated:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.feralchildren.com/en/children.php?tp=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.feralchildren.com/en/children...</a><br>  <br>   If they did not learn a language before their isolation, they did not speak or act like a person or wear/like wearing clothing. Recently, a brother and sister who had been confined in a small room for five years alone were found. They had speech impediments, were severely underweight, could not walk, were very short, and one of them had deformed feet. After a year or two after they were saved, they no longer had speech impediments, grew a little, and could walk.|`|l8aSPjE2aa	There were actually many research in this Sociology book I read.<br>  <br>  Apparently they found multiple children who have been ostracized their entire life in some kind of basement, attic, etc. <br>  <br>  They were found and some could not develop a language while others after lots of hard work could.<br>  <br>  They didn't know about religion because they were too uneducated about that, hence even know the word religion.<br>  <br>  I believe they were too well "stupid" to even think that life is useless and such.<br>  <br>  they honestly became barbarians. It's like william goldings savagery but starting at the age of 1. they all don't know the language...|`|AA12231462	Do you mean touch?

They had children raised on isolated islands by deaf mutes. The idea was that, deprived of a language, the child would grow up speaking the original language, the language God taught to Adam and Eve.  But for some reason the experiments were never successful.<br>  <br>  I tend to think children need some human contact to survive.  Children denied human contact would just starve to death, or be a quick meal for predators.  There are folktales about children raised by wolves, but you have to wonder.  Have you ever seen wolves adopt and raise the young of other species?  Hell no, unguarded young are FOOD!<br>  <br>  Nihilism is actually a very sophisticated philosophy, if you think about it.  I mean it only goes back to the 19th century and apparently it still hasn't reached its peak!<br>  <br>  Belief in God seems to be part of human nature.  People have always seemed to have a need to believe in -something-.  But contemporary monotheistic religions have been developing for thousands of years, and most of what we 'know' about God is man-made doctrines.  A person raised in solitude might make up a 'primitive' belief system.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	That actually happened. I think in the 60s or 70s there was this girl who was beaten by her mother and locked up in the attack or something. I remember learning about it. <br>  <br>  She did not know how to count or talk. She could only grunt and point. <br>  <br>  Anyway, the child probably would not be able to talk or count or read. They would not be able to develop language or any skills. Probably would not believe in God, either. <br>  <br>  If they are out in the wild, they would be savage and be like an animal.

5oAU7S9zaa	Need by Carrie Jones-<br>  <br>   Zara collects phobias the way other high school girls collect lipsticks. Little wonder, since life’s been pretty rough so far. Her father left, her stepfather just died, and her mother’s pretty much checked out. Now Zara’s living with her grandmother in sleepy, cold Maine so that she stays “safe.” Zara doesn’t think she’s in danger; she thinks her mother can’t deal.  Wrong. Turns out that guy she sees everywhere, the one leaving trails of gold glitter, isn’t a figment of her imagination. He’s a pixie—and not the cute, lovable kind with wings. He’s the kind who has dreadful, uncontrollable needs. And he’s trailing Zara<br>   <br>  Evermore by Alyson Noel-<br>  <br>  Since a horrible accident claimed the lives of her family, sixteen-year-old Ever can see auras, hear people’s thoughts, and know a person’s life story by touch.

O7KR3tgjaa	Cheesy romance novels are the best!<br>  Okay, so brace yourself for this long answer:<br>  <br>  I like to read paranormal romances by Kresley Cole, Sherrilyn Kenyon, JR Ward, Alexandra Ivy, and Gena Showalter. They write great novels that are a bit sexual (okay, maybe sometimes even WAY too sexual)that's make you laugh, cry, your pulse jump, heart stop, and swoon over the hunky guys-- all at once.<br>  <br>  Some of my favorites include the Lords of the Underworld (LOTU) and the Tales of Atlantis (TOA) series by Gena Showalter, the Kiss of a Demon King by Kresley Cole, and some of the Dark Hunters books by Kenyon. <br>  <br>  The LOTU series is about a group of warriors who had sworn to keep Pandora's box out of the hands of evil but failed to do so and are now cursed. They each embody one of the demons in the box: disease, pain, death, violence, lust, etc. The curse has erected a wall of depression, loneliness, and hopelessness for all of them until they meet women who will change their lives forever. They will bring sunshine back into their lives as each demon is tamed and taught to love.<br>  <br>  The first books begins with the story of Maddox (keeper of Violence) and Ashlyn, a human who hears voices in her head, conversations of the past. The second: Lucien (keeper of Death) and Anya, a goddess of chaos and mischief. And thirdly, the story of Reyes (keeper of Pain) and Danika, a human who learns to trust and love him.<br>  <br>  The story doesn't end there. Sabin's story comes out in either May or November of this year, Aeron's comes out next year as well as another that I have yet to know about. <br>  <br>  The TOA series is about the dragon warriors, the Amazons, and vampires from the underwater city of Atlantis. Each story is set in Atlantis or around it and they are all unique to the characters of the romances. The first is about Darius and Grace (dragon and human), the second is about a human and an Amazon, and the third which I really really want to read is about a vampire king who thought he had lost love forever. But he didn't ;)<br>  <br>  Since I'm out of time, you'll have to google them up on your own. I've just finished the first one and onto my second. Trust me, you won't regret reading them.<br>  <br>  Once again, I emphasize that they are R-rated-- so brace yourself for a lot of internal swooning, naughtiness that'll get you crossed off of Santa's list, and even some drooling.

I didn't drool, but my friend claims she did!|`|USuUMIlHaa	Twilight baiter!<br>  This is what I'm calling people who ask questions and are dying for them to be answered twilight<br>  <br>  If I were you,I'd read a real book like To Kill A Mockingbird|`|sLpFdR06aa	i would first suggest twilight <br>  then you have to read boys that bite, stake that, and girls that growl<br>  in that order.when i first picked up the book, i thought it was pretty perverted, but when i started reading it, it was as good as twilight. you have read it. it is also about vampires if u are a vampire fan.|`|AA12058022	Twilight Series... its fantasy and romance...

XxtVwslraa	Getting a book published is a long process that may very well take years. <br>  <br>  1. The first thing to do is to completely your book. When I say completely I mean having edited it within an inch of its life. If you don't feel up to the task of editing then there are companies that will. Mind you, these companies are expensive. It cost about $1000 dollars to have the average 50,000 word book edited.<br>  <br>   2. Do the research on how to write a query letter.  This is the hardest part because you have to take a 50,000 word book and sell it in one page. Do no skimp on this part because its what gets you through the door. The very first thing literary agents see is your query letter. No matter how brilliant your book is, if you bomb the query letter then you be denied.  Also , research how to write a synopsis since literary agents may also request that and an outline.<br>  <br>  3. Decide what genre you're book is. Research the different genres and match your book to the best one. Be as accurate as possible because agencies tend to only represent certain genres. <br>  <br>  4. Research different literary agents. My suggestion is to use Writer's Market. Narrow down your list to agencies that are I. accepting new submissions  II. Represent your specific genre. Once you have done this read each agencies submission guidelines carefully. Don't assume that all guidelines are the same. They are not. The guidelines vary from agency to agency. Many agencies have several agents and ask that you only submit to one. <br>  <br>  5. Submit your novel according to the guidelines and prepare to wait. It may take months to hear  a response from an agency. Once you are signed with agency they will do the work of finding you a publisher. The time from agency signing to actually publishing can take about a year, give or take.<br>  <br>  Do's: Finish and edit your novel, do your research on each agency thoroughly, follow the submissions guideline thoroughly, perfect your query letter and synopsis, be patient<br>  <br>  Don'ts: Keep calling the agency to see if they received your letter, send your manuscript unless they request it o unless the submission guidelines SAY its okay<br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|YorMkZYAaa	Get a copy of The Writer's Market and do some research.<br>  <br>  And use the damn search bar.|`|fkwYvFBRaa	If you are looking for self-publishing companies to publish your book, I know of a few companies that practically holds court to everything a book needs from getting you your copyright, size preferences, book cover design customization, layout consultation, copyediting and even marketing – at affordable costs.<br>  <br>  The difference with self-publishing is that you happen to send in your materials to the publisher and they will do all the work for you depending on which program you are on. It is best if you send in the entire manuscript and should not worry about protection because publishers have an agreement to not use your material without your consent. <br>  <br>  Publishing packages now are very affordable and investing on getting your book published is a good start.<br>  <br>  Most self-publishing companies have programs that costs about $250 to $12999 and is highly dependent on the kind of services that you will be getting which is why it is very significant to carefully map out your book's budget as early as now. <br>  <br>  Publishing companies now have all the resources to publish books with the same productivity and efficacy as that of regular black and white books. Considering the fact that most books are in full color, you should choose a publishing company whose book’s are of the highest quality, bar none.<br>   <br>  Self-publishing entirely means that you get to retain full control of your book’s production and that it gives you the option to publish your work and claim authority of the photos that you have chosen to be published.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Publishing is synonymous to getting that copyright for protecting your book which is why it is highly important to publish it.<br>  <br>  You can get free information sent to your mail here and even try to check the quality of their brochure because it is the same as how they publish books. The cost to publish is also listed in detail and in depth.<br>  <br>  I hope I helped.|`|cRBFmLtCaa	Look on internet for<br>  "Literary agencies" they will get you through the process|`|Agw4pXAnaa	I have a copy of The Writer's Market and it is very helpful.
rr6IpMQBaa	Okay.. Here we go.<br>  Jessica Stanley- Bella's BFF in the beginning. By the end she doesn't like her that well. She is mostly friends with Bella for her popularity.<br>  Angela Weber- Described by Edward as the nicest person ever (even in her thoughts). She is very knid and has a gentle disposition. She respects the space and privacy of others, which leads Bella to like her even more.<br>  Mike Newton- A friendly boy who first talks to Bella and has a crush on her. She doesn't like him that way. He is described by Edward as having improper thoughts about bella. He aslo has a strong dis like for Edward.<br>  Lauren Mallory- A mean girl who doesn't like Bella becuase her boyfriend Tyler likes her. She is very jealous of Bella and all the attention she gets. <br>  Eric York- The overly- helpful chess geek :) He likes Bella when she first moves to Forks.<br>  Tyler Crowley-  Nearly hits Bella with a van, but she is saved by Edward. His constant attention for Bella causes Lauren to not like her. He keeps asking her to prom as making up for almost runnong her over with a van.<br>  The Vampires at school:<br>  Edward Cullen- The love of Bella's life. In twilight, it is said that Bella is his "brand of heroin". He does everything with her, and is constantly watching out for her. He saves her from many vampires.<br>  Alice Cullen- Bella's Best friend. She is easily warmed up to her becuase she sees them becoming best friends. She is Bella's Maid Of Honor and her advice when she needs help about something she can't tell Edward.<br>  Hope That helps!

za9b8cHKaa	Sounds like a rather pathetic move. If the books truly were dangerous then any child who had ever been inside a library or bookstore would be dead from lead poisoning by now. Or what about the people who spent their careers working in libraries or bookstores? Or at a printing press?<br>  <br>  Definitely shades of 1984 here.|`|TWq0Hmx6aa	Disposing of books? Truly seeing that is sad. I had a friend who used to burn his books. Breaks my little heart.<br>  <br>  But books containing lead? Never heard of that before.|`|C2FkuVESaa	I'm literally so angered, so stunned by this that I don't know what to say.<br>  <br>  Christ, are we really so paranoid, stupid, and....*explode*|`|AA10438186	Your thrift store over reacted.  There is no ban on old books at thrift stores.  In fact thrift stores were exempted from the law regarding all material that a child may get their hands on.  The law currently states that NEW ! products cannot contain more than 0.06% lead by weight.<br>  <br>  About a year from now the stores selling NEW products will have to certify the lead content of toys etc.  But NOT thrift stores.<br>  <br>  For more info please read <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~wrltc/Awareness.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.mindspring.com/~wrltc/Awarene...</a> Its a book I wrote for parents doing re-modeling or having it done. And lead issues in general. It was paid for by a fed/state grant. Which means its your book as much as mine. Education about this subject is my job.  For more direct questions please contact me at wrltc@mindspring.com And feel free to pass this along to others.|`|YorMkZYAaa	Sounds more like a bullshit government attempt at censorship. I read many books published before 1985 (I was born in 1980) and I turned out fine. *twitches* Just kidding.<br>  <br>  It's pathetic, truly. I hope someone wakes up enough to protest this nonsense. What next? Banning 1984 out of fear it may convince people to fight Big Brother?

sv4uDsm0aa	superheros and aliens|`|f2zW2pRfaa	i think what "disinterested" is asking for would be a minarchist goverment( a goverment where the goverments only duty is to prevent people getting killed). another interpretation would be what the libertarians want which is extreme capitalism but that doesn't work. just take a look at what happens when you take off the people who are supposed to check that people don't get greedy and the economy goes down. and it only suits the rich which is a very small percentage of the population<br>  <br>  i think that the perfect world would rely on the utilitarian phylosophies proposed by jeremy bentham in this type of politcal establishment what suits the majority is what is chosen I also think that there should be some ethical consideration when thinking of a utilitarian government because if there are three people that need organ transplant and one guy who has all of the necessary organs but does not wish to donate what do you do. well this is were the "perfection within the imperfection kicks in because if you take his organs isn't that violating his natural rights(this is the conflict between natural rights phylosophers and utilitarian philosephers).that is why i think one should have a combination of some natural rights theories and also some utilitarian theories. in modern day prospectives i would think that this translates into a socialistic capitilistic goverment. NOT like the one we have now. obviuosly revisions would have to be made.|`|7MYLIbjgaa	hmmm...mine would be pretty similar, where there is the perfect balance and people aren't rude and instead are civilized, mannered, selfless, and kind but at the same time aren't afraid to be who they are and people don't beat around the bush when they want to say something!! that's my ideal world for the most part.|`|GyBeE7ofaa	Perfection implies a limitless reality, and thus it cannot exist, because existence by definition is composed of limits (shapes, definitions etc...). Thus, the only perfect existence is that which has no limits and that can be found in perfect, limitless non-existence (i.e. death).|`|mhDOHoSHaa	A place where nobody is racist, prejudice, judgmental, or corrupt, and everyone is accepted for who they are.|`|hjO0cqhKaa	Yes, I have a perfect world and it's called Cuckoo Land.<br>  <br>  Do wars, at all, work out well in the end?

tqg3qZzSaa	If Napoleon had beaten Wellington decisively and driven him to the sea capturing much of the British army, the most likely scenario would of been the British having to rebuild their army and not being able to refit for an expedition for well over a month, giving Napoleon much needed time. If the Prussians were also decisively defeated and totally routed the allies might of thought twice about invading France. Spain would of probably made peace and the Dutch would of likely joined Napoleon. With their main army destroyed, Prussia would of been in no position to take part in the war until a new army could be raised and then be marched to France. This would of left Napoleon with Austria and Russia as enemies. Both had pledged to put 150,000 each into the field and their armies were already on the march. Napoleon had mobilized 300,000 soldiers across France and had more in training, add to that a Dutch army and any Italians that chose to join him and Napoleon would of had a sizable army. With smaller allies forces marching toward France, Napoleon could of force marched his army to Germany and a new campaign with several possible outcomes would of began.|`|fcf427fccc8fa8230c38f4b869207e8aaa	the same thing which happened in the campaign leading up to, and after the Battle of Leipzig. More and more armies coming from all the surrounding countries and Napoleon dashing here and there trying to stem the tide.<br>  <br>  I think by that time the world was fed up with Napoleon. No one was willing to trust him anymore. Sure- he was feared but whatever ther differences the various european nations had, getting rid of Napoleon was their one common and absolute priority
tL73W0VZaa	Your English seems great. I wouldn't start quoting Pride and Prejudice too often. Once and a while is cool, but people might start thinking that you're trying to show off. So I would only quote when it feels natural, and you don't think that it will come out sounding stilted.|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Uh...why would you want to do that? It's centuries out of date. Nobody speaks like that any more, even in England, and you're in the US.<br>  <br>  Trying to talk like somebody out of _any_ book is probably a bad idea. People don't talk like book dialogue - they are much less coherent and more casual than even modern written dialogue is. Just be yourself. If you try to talk like someone else, at best you'll sound pretentious and at worst you'll sound laughable.|`|7teVzN10aa	lol, your english is fine! its probably a lot better than most americans, believe me, what with our slangs and internet talk. if u incorporate phrases, r u saying ur trying to quote stuff? because if u r, i think u'd sound pretty wise, and intelligent if u do it correctly. if u r saying u want to talk the way they do, u'll sound old fashioned, no offense, because ppl don't talk like that anymore =/<br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. see how bad my english is?? lol, i'd type with proper spelling and grammer and stuff, but this isn't a school assignment or anything, so =D<br>  <br>  EDIT<br>  cathrl is rite too. thumbs up for him!

MQ5Sq6wfaa	I am a photographer / graphic designer.  If I had this project I would choose:<br>  <br>  You have a great ability to focus on the big picture and not get lost in details.<br>  <br>  I would take several small pictures that look like one large overall picture.  A cool way to do it could be to have a model where you take several pictures of them in the same pose, and the same distance away from them in several environments.  Don't try to put the model back together perfectly though, but make it look close to being solid.
NiuYkbGMaa	A Confederation, like the government under the Articles, is weak. State's power over-rode the power of the national government. Each state looked out for itself. The economy was in shambles because each state could tax another state's products when entering that state. States could print their own money and not accept other state's money. Economic anarchy would result. We would have no economic credit with foreign nations and no political respect.
ahjqc9Ifaa	Maybe you need to get feedback on your work from people who know what they're talking about. You can either join a writing site or in-person critique group, or do it the cheap way--by reading the magazines you think your work might be appropriate for, then submitting if you feel it compares well to what they're publishing. Total cost, postage.<br>  <br>  If you want serious critique, I recommend <a href="http://absolutewrite.com/forums/index.php?referrerid=88" rel="nofollow">http://absolutewrite.com/forums/index.ph...</a><br>  <br>  At the Share Your Work boards writers can get critique from people who know what they’re talking about. (It’s far more useful than feedback from friends and family, who tend to praise because you’re you.) The SYW boards are separated by genre, so your vampire story won’t be critiqued by western writers, or your screenplay by poets. Criticism is honest but never cruel, and limited to the writing, not the writer. Most people offer not just negative feedback but note positives, too, plus instruction and encouragement to try again.|`|2GdZSXC1aa	First off, never force yourself to write. You must be inspired by the moment in order to let the creativity flow.  I would keep a note pad or a small voice recorder with me at all times to jot down anything that might occur to me that would add to the plot of the novel. Think of your characters and their personalities. What would so and so do under this or that circumstance. Get inside their heads and see whats there.|`|Vraywn6Vaa	Google will find hundreds. The trick is to sort the scams from the genuine. Send in a poem and you may discover that although you haven't won, your poem is good enough to publish - and would you like to buy twenty copies of the book?<br>  <br>  Enter competitions if they serve your purpose. I have a children's book which is, as yet, unpublished. There's a competition for a children's play so I'm rewriting it in that format. I probably wouldn't write a play for the competition otherwise, but I know it works and, win or lose, it is worth the punt.<br>  <br>  On and off work on your novel? Writing is a disciplined activity. I carry stories around in my head. I have to write them down/type them in, rather like emptying the pedal bin every so often, or my head gets full, If you're a writer, prove it by showing a writer's discipline.<br>  <br>  (Hobbles back to the garret to find those yellowing notes for that story about the hairy thing with six legs and a beak - or was there a hairy thing with six legs and a beak hiding under the desk? I forget.)<br>  <br>  Elizabeth.<br>  <br>  I'm not a great believer in 'inspiration'. Essentially I regard myself as a story teller. I often tell stories about whatever idea a kid suggests just to prove that there's no limit. They might say, "tell me a story about that doorknob." The writer's art is to be able to rise to the challenge. The bottom line is that as a writer you are an entertainer. Too many writers don't realise that.<br>  <br>  If you don't know where the story is going then my belief is that you sit down and let it take you somewhere. I don't like the idea that you let it fester and decide if it's duff later. Better just to bin it if you have serious doubts in my opinion.

The eraser crumbs mixes in with the sticky stuff to make a less sticky glob the color of your eraser. When the glob grows to a considerable size and is at the point of smearing, scratch it off and keep working at the remaining stuff. It should be gone in a while.

ITp29ACWaa	It all depends on how much time you're willing to invest in your book. No doubt the first option would produce the best result though it will take longer. My opinion is that if you've put your effort, your time, your heart and soul into this book then you need to go the extra mile to make sure that it's the best it can be. Think about it. You finish this book. You get it published or don't; I don't know. But in ten, twenty years you look back on it. Do you want to think, "man, I wish I had really taken the time to make this character realistic." I mean, no regrets, right?|`|gmJAKYTlaa	Edit her in.

They have ZERO clout in Hollywood (and yes, I know what I am talking about, send me a message and I'll email you my resume anytime).  They are all about taking the dreams of aspiring and hopeful actors and preying upon them, taking your money, and delivering nothing that is of ANY useful value in the reality of LA or NY.  <br>  <br>  The agencies and casting studios/directors they say they are affiliate with is a joke.  None of those people need any 'affiliation' to find new talent.  They are literally hundreds of submissions to their offices each day by people who have taken the time to get great headshots, build their resume, and develop their craft with training from recognized and respected sources.  Nustars is NOT one of the sources.<br>  <br>  So please, take a nickles worth of advice, and build your career carefully and don't waste your money on this.  Oh, also, put nustars in the yahoo search field and 'nustars scam' is the first suggested line.

You can only have a good leap as long as your splits are good.<br>  -A leap is nothing without height. get momentum by traveling to really maximize the height of your leap!<br>  <br>  For splits...<br>  -Stretch every day. It's generic advice, but it's really the best surefire way to get them.<br>  -Sit in a pike stretch and try to reach your nose to your knees. Hold this for a bit and then relax. Do it again and again to get a good stretch.<br>  -Sit in a straddle and push yourself up against a wall. Hold for a bit then release. Flip over to your belly and do the same thing.<br>  -Sit in a butterfly and walk your hands out to warm up your hips. Hold for a bit until you feel the stretch and then release.<br>  -Sit with one leg in front of you and lean over, trying to get your nose to your knee. Hold and release, then switch legs. <br>  -Put one leg behind you (like you would if you were in a split) and stay there to feel the stretch in your hip. Switch legs.<br>  <br>  The number one most important thing: don't give up or get discouraged! Everything comes with practice, and you'll nail everything in due time. Good luck, and I hope you make the team!|`|GSYW5YMuaa	ask ur dance teacher for help or keep practcing them<br>  good luck|`|BFrbQLwqaa	double pirouettes- just make sure you are over your center on the leg you're turning on, and a good spot (2 times for the double)<br>  <br>  split stretches- touching your toes standing our sitting, straddle position going forward and to each side, and laying on your back and pulling 1 leg back as far as you can keeping it straight<br>  <br>  right split leaps- well practicing the split stretches will help a little bit, and good plie before the jump, a lot of energy into the jump, getting to a point where both legs are straight and even in the jump

I think that the army was just as bad as hitler; hitler gave those awful orders and the army carried them out.|`|8WqTvPBbaa	Well Hitler ran the army and told the men what to do so Hitler|`|iL1tYfJMaa	the soldier were simply following orders...so HITLER.|`|fy35c6vGaa	that question is too difficult to answer, many of Hitlers senior  government officials  were equally as guilty and helped him get to power. many of them acted alone in the pillage and rape of Europe. With little or no orders from Hitler.<br>  <br>  Some were even charged for stealing from the the 3rd Reich and not following proper protocol. <br>  <br>  There were a great number of officials that were as accountable for the atrocities. Hitler surrounded himself with members of the party that had similar ideals.|`|CSuP72lOaa	I agree...The armies were just following orders...Hitler was the man behind it all...and another thing...people like to put all the soldiers into the "SS" category.

RzbRRUOdaa	You need to have a literary agent if you want to get traditionally published.  The literary agent will do the leg work for you in terms of having your manuscript reviewed for acceptance or rejection.  This process takes time - a few months, at least.<br>  <br>  If and when your book is accepted, you will be paid for the rights and the publishing house will publish your book according to how the want to package it and based on their time frame.<br>  <br>  If you don't want to go through this process, you can opt to self-publish - which is what many of the writers these days do.  You will have full ownership and control of  your book and you can get it published within a period of 6 to 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  Click on this link for information on the publishing process:<br>  <a href="http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.com/" rel="nofollow">http://selfpublishingjourney.wordpress.c...</a><br>  <br>  I hope you find this answer helpful.

ufcbQQvbaa	The easiest way is to get a light bright board, or something along those lines in order to illuminate the back, then put whatever kind of paper you're going to use over the tracing paper and use the light to make a clear picture.|`|egeuNalTaa	Hi Zero, so if you have a drawing or sketch on tracing paper, you can turn it over so the drawing is face down.  Using some form of soft graphite, (pencil or stick) cover the lines you want to transfer with the graphite, then turn it back over, drawing side up and place it on the surface you want to transfer onto, then trace again your drawing.  This should leave you with a nice little outline on the desired surface.      Hope this helps, be warm and well, jb
j5Apt8hWaa	Start by looking at One Model Place and Model Mayhem for photographers in your area that shoot TFP.  After you have had sessions with about five or six, you will have 1) some good face time in front of the camera, 2) know how different photographers can be in their approach to lighting, pose direction and their style and 3) been able to accumulate a nice book of about 10 to 12 excellent shots which show many different looks and how comfortable you are with the camera and those behind it.<br>  <br>  Choose your top five shots and open a profile on OMP and your best 20 shots and open a profile on Model Mayhem (both free accounts).   <br>  <br>  Once a member of both, you can the look for "open calls" hosted by modeling or advertising agencies and maybe magazines.  With your "book" in hand, start attending them and go from there.|`|D9x1QSgiaa	Well....If you have money to blow, you COULD attend a "Modeling School or Academy".....but they are not always what they are cracked up to be. In fact...I would venture to say that MANY of the best, well known professional models have NOT attended a modeling school. The problem is that MANYYYY of them are nothing but a "front" for a photographer or his business. Of course the Modeling School or Academy will insist that all of your photos come from this ONE photographer...so it's all about money, money, money. Many modeling agencies won't ask the model if she was "schooled" by a professional Modeling School or not. <br>  <br>  Since experience is more important than school, it doesn't really make THAT much difference if he or she was or not formally trained. I have gotten some excellent results from many of the models I have used who have NEVER attended a Modeling School. Some of the best models are children. They don't have too many bad habits, but they can be impatient at times. Most models can do well if they are given 10-15 minutes of coaching and instructions they usually catch on well. <br>  <br>  What is also important in the whole process is your ability to make a GREAT portfolio...that is....a decent album of your best shots in a variety of settings. That includes swimsuit photos, head shots, formal wear, product promotions, you name it. The portfoilio must display the model in a variety of settings and backgrounds to display to a potential advertiser that she is versatile and capable of promotion the product or merchandise in the way that best reflects the image of the company and appealling to their clientele. I have used many models who never show their face....so good looks don't ALWAYS carry a lot of weight either. Many times I am taking photos of their hands, back profile or some other body part.<br>  <br>  If you are over age 14-15 you are considered to be "late starter" in THIS business.....many models are starting at around age 12, 13 or 14. If you have waited until age 15 or 16, you have already lost a lot of time on the competitors. Many models are finished by age 28 or sooner.<br>  <br>  I suggest that you find a good photographer who is capable of helping you make a portfolio. Some photographers (such as new photographers or college students) may work with you on what is known as TFP...(Trade for Photos)...in other words.... you sign a Model Release allowing the photographer to use your photos for FREE and he/she supplies a good selection of photos for you to keep (for FREE) in your portfolio. One hand washes the other in this kind of agreement. <br>  <br>  Also....your BEST choice of Modeling Agencies WILL be in the larger cities...New York, Boston, L.A. , San Francisco, Atlanta, Miami, Dallas, Houston, etc.....but I don't necessarily suggest that you move, until you are better established. Also...don't be afraid to post a few photos HERE for us to see as well. Be sure to have an online presence at websites such as modelmayhem.com, onemodelplace.com or other such sites. Making your OWN site featuring YOU (and ONLY YOU) is also a great idea. You need business cards with your face on them and your website address. You'll need to also print flyers with 3 or 4 great shots of you. They need to be mailed to modeling agencies (not the schools), ad agencies, and anyone else you can find who could use you in the promotion of their business in any way. Agencies DOOOO look at these sites from time to time to scout for new talent. There are probably some decent photographers in the YOUR area or some other nearby larger city.<br>  I also suggest that you go to www.newmodels.com   and read everything you see there for more information about the best websites and what T.F.P. is all about.<br>  <br>  Good Luck

ceBTTCPwaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."<br>  <br>  These links should give you detailed and excellent answers to this and other questions :<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/To_Kill_a_Mockin...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/tkm/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/tokillamocking...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/T...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/tokill2.html</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Here's a start:<br>  <br>  Mr. Raymond is a borderline figure who confuses Maycomb’s neat social and racial categories. <br>  <br>  Scout and Dill find out that Mr. Raymond does care about what other people think, but not in the way they expected.

ceBTTCPwaa	Julius Caesar is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1599. It portrays the conspiracy against the Roman dictator of the same name, his assassination and its aftermath. It is one of several Roman plays that he wrote, based on true events from Roman history, which also include Coriolanus and Antony and Cleopatra.<br>  <br>  Although the title of the play is Julius Caesar, Caesar is not the main character in its action; he appears in only three scenes, and is killed at the beginning of the third act. The protagonist of the play is Marcus Brutus, and the central psychological drama is his struggle between the conflicting demands of honor, patriotism, and friendship.<br>  <br>  The play reflected the general anxiety of England over succession of leadership. At the time of its creation and first performance, Queen Elizabeth, a strong ruler, was elderly and had refused to name a successor, leading to worries that a civil war similar to that of Rome might break out after her death.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Julius_Caesar" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Julius_Caesar</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/jc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/jc/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ju..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ju...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/JuliusCaesar/i..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/JuliusCaesar/i...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/J..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/J...</a>|`|xJoMSkI5aa	Brutus is in many ways the protagonist.  <br>  <br>  He first debates whether he should act against Caesar.<br>  Then, he has to debate the ramifications of his actions.<br>  <br>  From Shmoop/Julius Caesar|`|Agw4pXAnaa	Brutus for one.

1zfwLsQpaa	1) It was Germans, sad and defeated, treated unfairly for a war they didn't even begin. They lost their identity and fell into one of the worst economic crisis they have ever seen. Through this desesparation a strange austrian man came out, he was an odd looking fellow. He promised to restore Germany to its greatness, he blamed Jews for the loss of the First world war. People fell in love with this incredible speaker. He was Adolf Hitler, he helped restore German identity and glory.<br>  <br>  2) Sorry<br>  <br>  3) It was a World War because it involved every single country in the world. Some sent men to fight. Other countries like the ottoman empire fell. Others did not fight but where severely affected economically speaking.<br>  <br>  4) The people in Russia where tired of being rulled by the Tsar. He lived a life of luxury while most common people in Russia where dying of hunger. Lenin using Marxist Communist ideas believed that people should work for their country. After tsar Nicholas was assassinated they took on a revolution and Lenin came to power of the Soviet Union<br>  <br>  5) Mussolini was the first one of the three in power, in a way it inspired the other two to do the same, he was sort of like the father of fascism, he in his blackshirts took power in the 20's. Adolf Hitler (and his brown shirts the SA, sturmabeiltung) like I stated previously used the weakened German image and blamed the Jews for economical crisis. Everywhere everyone went in Germany it seemed that the banks and stores were owned by Jews, people began to agree with his racial ideas. In 1932 he was DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED as president of Germany. He created the office of Fuhrer, became absolute leader of Germany and destroyed his opposition. Joseph Stalin similarly destroyed his opposition in the great purge. He killed thousands of innocent people (many more than hitler) to make sure that his communist ideas met no opposition|`|G6eUPxQlaa	Okay.<br>  PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Scott Fitzgerald. First published on April 10, 1925, it is set in Long Island's North Shore and New York City during the summer of 1922.<br>  <br>  The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz Age". Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in organized crime. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/f..." rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/f...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/thegreatgatsby..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/thegreatgatsby...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/greatgp2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/greatgp2.html</a>|`|tcZB8h9qaa	you should look on spark notes :P there is a section i think under themes and symbols or something.

d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	Plato (often through Socrates) taught that justice was primarily an internal matter, that ethical breaks created dissonance in one's mind and therefore created misery. For instance, a criminal wil not only be looking over his shoulder to avoid being caught, forcing him to keep his wrongdoing in his mind, but the act itself will cause a fracture between the part of him that recognizes it as wrong and the part that commits the act. The psyche wil be turned against itself. This is why Socrates said if we really wish someone harm who has wronged us, we should wish that they never get caught. Getting caught and being punished is, for Plato, a way of restoring order to the psyche.|`|CAEAvXdoaa	<a href="http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plato/rep/rep0108.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/plato/re...</a><br>   this is a link to a translation of the Socratic dialogue in which he argues with Thrasymachus<br>  hope it helps

UKGPj6Emaa	Hoover's greatest accomplishments were in the professionalization of law enforcement and in lobbying for federalized crime control during Roosevelt's New Deal, which led to virtually the creation of the modern FBI as we know it.<br>  <br>  If by "Top 5" you mean crimes solved by the FBI during his 48-year reign as Director, it woud be improper to give Hoover personal credit for solving these. These crimes were solved through teamwork by members of his organization and by other law enforcement agencies.<br>  <br>  Hoover's negative aspects, (i.e., his tyrannical and often illegal subversion of political opinions other his own, his civil rights violations, and his longtime reluctance to investigate organized crime) can hardly be considered "accomplishments."<br>  <br>  To give the devil his due, the good accomplished by the FBI far outweighs the bad. Still, Hoover was in power way too long and for too long abused that power significantly. History would surely be much kinder to J. Edgar if he had retired after the Dillinger days.<br>  <br>  And in fairness to Hoover (and in contrast to the gossipy negative biography by Anthony Summers), there is no real evidence that Hoover was either homosexual or a transvestite.

She received her name due to the number of planets she has lived in, having never settled on one she truly liked. She is later nicknamed "Wanda" by Mel's eccentric Uncle Jeb. Like all souls, she is naturally inclined to do good and is disgusted by violence. She feels incredibly guilty about the unrest her presence causes amongst Melanie's loved ones, and throughout the book she puts others before herself. She feels an initial affection for Jared, Melanie's lover, and Jamie, Mel's little brother, due to the memories she was fed by her host, and eventually develops her own relationship with both of them. She falls in love with Ian O'Shea and feels guilty that she was unable to reciprocate his feelings earlier. Wanderer is several thousand years old and looks like other souls -- a silver centipede-like creature -- but because she inhabits Melanie Stryder, she bears all of Mel's physical characteristics. Later in the book she is implanted in the body of another girl, who is petite and delicate with gold hair, freckled skin, silver eyes, and a dimple in her chin. In that body she cannot do much for herself, in the book saying she was always given the easiest jobs but half the time having the work pulled out of her hands anyway. She can't carry her own cot either, when she tried to, she has to have Ian carry it.<br>  <br>  Melanie "Mel" Stryder  – Melanie is a 20-year-old human who managed to escape capture by the invading souls for years, living on the run. Eventually she is captured, and a soul known as Wanderer is implanted in Mel's body. Mel continues to fight after Wanderer is implanted in her body, speaking to Wanderer and feeding her memories of the people she loves in hopes that Wanderer will one day lead her back to them. Mel likes the feeling of being physically strong and berates Wanderer for neglecting to keep her that way. She has a temper and may be considered volatile compared to docile Wanderer. Melanie is passionately in love with another human named Jared, and shares a strong mother-like bond with her younger brother. She grows to care for Wanderer deeply as a sister, as well. Melanie is described as beautiful, tall and athletic, naturally tan skin, a square face, dark brown hair, and hazel eyes.<br>  <br>  Ian O'Shea  – One of the rebel humans, Ian O'Shea is one of the first of the humans to treat Wanda with anything but hostility. He believes that she is an innocent girl who does not deserve to be punished because she inhabits Melanie's body. He eventually falls in love with Wanda and is shown to be extremely devoted to her. Ian does not get along well with Jared Howe, due partially to Wanda's affection for Jared and partially because of Jared's willingness to harm Wanda for his own personal gain. Ian is the only person who understands how Wanda thinks, and feels responsible for her since she is so self-sacrificing. Ian is described as being "kind enough to be a soul but strong as only a human could be", beautiful, having pale skin, dark hair, and striking blue eyes.<br>  <br>  Jared Howe  – Jared is Melanie Stryder's lover. Circumstances always improve for the rebel humans he runs into, due to his great skill. He is seen as loving and somewhat excitable in Melanie's memories, though the loss of her renders him very bitter. He bears a grudge against Wanda and is unable to empathize with her for most of the book. He eventually develops a closer relationship with her in addition to his extreme devotion to Melanie. He is somewhat of a rival to Ian O'Shea, because Ian sees Jared as a competition for Wanda's affections. He is described as physically beautiful, with tan skin, sienna-colored eyes, and sun-bleached hair.<br>  <br>  Jamie Stryder  – Jamie is Melanie's younger brother and is 14 years old when he first meets Wanda. He develops a relationship with Wanda due to her closeness to his sister; eventually, he develops a strong brotherly bond with Wanda himself. He considers Wanda "angelic" and enjoys her stories about other planets. He is very close to Jared, though their relationship becomes tense due to Jared's shabby treatment of Wanda. Jamie is shown to want to be treated like a man; when he falls ill he is uncomfortable with the coddling he receives and yearns to go on raids with Jared and the other men. He is described as being the only person not to have difficulty with Wanda's transfer into a new body, possibly always seeing Mel and Wanda as two distinct beings. Jamie is described as having shaggy black curls and chocolate brown eyes.<br>  <br>  Uncle Jeb  – Jeb is Melanie's eccentric uncle. He was one of the first humans to suspect an alien invasion, and thus constructed an elaborate hide-out in caves beneath the Arizona desert. He believes that Wanda can fit in with the humans, and therefore puts both her and the others in very uncomfortable social situation. However, he remains convinced that no one will hurt Wanda du|`|d89ugMAcaa	homework?|`|5xhvx94Iaa	there was jeb kyle maggie sharon and um. thats all i remember lol

DF7wGWWKaa	It was not a good beginning. If you want a realistic answer, this is it.<br>  <br>  First of all, I already hate the first sentence. You do not need to reiterate that she was loud. We get that, I mean, you did say she yelled. And she is whiny and irritable from the start, complaining about her alarm clock. I'm sure that most of us hate alarms, but we just take it, we don't wax poetic about our precious dreams and stuff.<br>  The second paragraph is supposed to tell us of what happens next right? Get rid of it. No one wants to know what happens before we read it. It just gives your story and air of predictability. <br>  And then she goes on and complains about her dad, rubs her eyes, blah blah blah... All unimportant details we don't really need nor want to know about. <br>  I also noticed you say "a little too much" and "ugh" repetitively. Don't. It gives a vulgar tone to your writing.<br>  Stop addressing the reader personally unless you want this to sound like a diary entry.  That is a major problem with young authors, they tend to address the reader personally and give in a "day in the life" feel, which makes it all the more unbearable to read. <br>  The part about the 8th graders was just confusing. Cut it down. Sure, we hate those in higher grades, but you don't need to incessantly talk about them. <br>  Also, avoid using commas when it isn't needed. And combine some of your sentences. Try to use more advanced vocabulary. I understand this is from a child's point of view but I know that children use more words than "stupid" or "ugh".|`|uP9SQhkcaa	eh... its okay... I mean, its just not really my kind of story. And I don't like how the speaker is talking to the reader. I wouldn't do that.. And, just curious, how old are you?

I would suggest more immediate emotion. More stress or possibly consider starting the story at the big event your character is iterating to. Remember writing is re-writing.

That's the beautiful part of writing you get to re-do it over and over again until you get it the way you want it.|`|jzdDF3Ljaa	I hate how you say "a little too much" more than once.  and you repeated "beeo beep beep"<br>  <br>  and then I really, REALLY did not care what the guy's name is.

SqLIZQN5aa	It's not c or d. I'm leaning towards a.
SqLIZQN5aa	On September 3, 1944, Anne, along with her mother, Edith, her sister, Margot, and her father, Otto, boarded the last transport from Westerbork to Auschwitz-Birkenau. The transport arrived in Auschwitz on September 5, 1944 with 1,019 Jews on board. Men and women were separated. The women selected from this transport, including Anne, Edith, and Margot, were marked with numbers between A-25060 and A-25271. Records indicating their exact numbers have not been preserved. Approximately eight weeks later, in late October 1944, Anne and Margot were transferred from Auschwitz-Birkenau to Bergen-Belsen, where they both died sometime in March 1945. Though Anne's death certificate documents her movement between camps, it, too, does not include her tattoo ID number.

As the boys come to each other, Attean learns to speak English, while Matt becomes a skilled hunter. Many months pass with no sign of Matt's family.

I don't know...good luck though!|`|Iwk92vqyaa	Suggest, first, that you ditch all titles. Titles for a work not even written just get in the way of creativity that really flows more easily without them. They tend to 'crimp.'<br>  <br>  Next, suggest you study Tokio Hotel (which you probably already have) again, and cast a special kind of 'light' on that band. This light will have all kinds of shadows, patterns, and otherwise unrecognized things about the band; the dark side.<br>  <br>  You'll see patterns of 'sad' if you look for them. Every band I've ever followed, known or interviewed had some 'sad' around them; in their history of previous life-jobs, in their history together, in later history of falling apart. Bands have constant troubles with ego, with sudden fame, with stage-fright, with mania and depression, drugs; lots of things.<br>  <br>  Once you see some pattern you can use for this fanfic, use it. Lead into it as if (perhaps) into an interview with just one member, or use it to lead into your story with an action scene that teases the readers to want to know more about the 'darker shade of pale.' (I know, old song is 'lighter shade of pale,' just trying to fit this in here.)<br>  <br>  Suggest an action scene because as you likely know by now, they are always the best way to hook readers.<br>  Best of luck with this and with all else you may write...<br>  ADD: If you go w/this answer for the fanfic: don't use my 'name.' That offer is totally unneeded for this question. No one, as you say, is writing this for you. You get that.

wLOXyEVGaa	Read City of Bones....<br>  <br>  When sixteen-year-old Clary Fray heads out to the Pandemonium Club in New York City, she hardly expects to witness a murder — much less a murder committed by three teenagers covered with strange tattoos and brandishing bizarre weapons. Then the body disappears into thin air. It's hard to call the police when the murderers are invisible to everyone else and when there is nothing — not even a smear of blood — to show that a boy has died. Or was he a boy? <br>  This is Clary's first meeting with the Shadowhunters, warriors dedicated to ridding the earth of demons. It's also her first encounter with Jace, a Shadowhunter who looks a little like an angel and acts a lot like a jerk. Within twenty-four hours Clary is pulled into Jace's world with a vengeance, when her mother disappears and Clary herself is attacked by a demon. But why would demons be interested in ordinary mundanes like Clary and her mother? And how did Clary suddenly get the Sight? The Shadowhunters would like to know... <br>  <br>  Exotic and gritty, exhilarating and utterly gripping, Cassandra Clare's ferociously entertaining fantasy takes readers on a wild ride that they will never want to end. <br>   <br>  The sequels are City of Ashes and City of Glass(March 2009)<br>  <br>  You might find it better than Twilight!!<br>  It has demons, vampires, werewolves, shadowhunters, and romance!!|`|3cFFGPkIaa	The Luxe Series by Anne Godberson are really good.<br>  They had many twists! ;p<br>  <br>  "A big, sumptuous tale of catty girls, dark secrets and windswept romance unfurls in this compulsively readable novel of late-19th-century New York City socialites. Godbersen weaves a tenuous web of deceit, backstabbing and pretense that follows four teens: Elizabeth Holland, a prim and proper lady of old-money society, is betrothed to one man, though furtively loves another; Henry Schoonmaker, a debauched playboy who must marry Elizabeth or be disinherited; Diana Holland, Elizabeth’s younger sister who is in love with her fiancé; and Penelope Hayes, a member of the nouveau riche who will stop at nothing to win Henry’s affections. As Elizabeth and Henry’s wedding approaches, the spectacle unfolds in a wondrously grandiose scene, making for a fun, though not entirely unexpected dénouement."<br>  <br>  ****also, if you liked Twilight (i adored those books)...<br>  then you might like The House of Night Series by P.C. and Kristen Cast...<br>  <br>  "You can still have your insanely attractive vampires, teen girl narrator, and a splash of romance (Ok, so Twilight has more a tidal wave than a splash.) <br>  <br>  But, you can exchange the overpowering portion of teen angst, monotonous description, and Bella tunnel vision for a kickass heroine, a hilarious group of friends/sidekicks, and a healthy dose of action.<br>  <br>  The House of Night series takes place in a world where vampires are no secret. Select teenagers are “marked” during their adolescence with a giant crescent tattoo in the middle of their forehead. If marked, a teenager must go live at the House of Night, a chain of boarding schools that train fledgling vampires and help them make it through The Change."<br>  <br>  :)|`|yVKB4eehaa	holy cow!<br>  4x each? wow.

x8MvlRICaa	The hardcover edition is more expensive, and the first time a book is published it is usually in hardcover edition (which I think is stupid, since it's more expensive, and if it's a new author no one knows about, why would you want to spend more money on his/her book). Once all, or most of, the hardcover editions are sold, the book is republished in a softcover edition. I usually buy my books in softcover because it is cheaper. Hardcover books deteriorate less over time, but if you take care of your books this shouldn't be a problem for soft-covers.|`|ITp29ACWaa	Hardbacks are more durable (and expensive).

wnkoTEqVaa	The Japanese had the American and Filipino army march to old training camps. There was about 75,000 and about 21,000 died. The men walked about 60 miles and the Japanese treated the men awful. Men were stabbed, beheaded, buried alive, clubbed, and many had body parts cut off because their bodies swelled because of beriberi and the Japanese wanted their watches and wedding or class rings. <br>  <br>  When they got to Camp O Donenell there was little room for them men. So stayed while others were transported to other camps via train. They were cramped in trains and could not even sit or lie down. The men stayed in the camps like cabanatuan for a while until the Japanese started to send them to Japan in hell ships to work in coal mines in factories. <br>  <br>  When America invaded the Philipines the Japanese started to kill the men in camps. <br>  <br>  Japan was later tried of war crimes because of this. Many men were scared for life because of the injuries and seeing the deaths of their buddies. <br>  <br>  You should read Ghost Soldiers and No Uncle Sam these are two books that are well written and are jammed packed with information.|`|foeRCrStaa	The Bataan Death March was conducted by the invading Japanese Army after the fall of Manila and the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines. The troops who surrendered both Filipino and US were forced march a great distance to a POW camp. Many of the troops who were malnourished and disease ridden fell along the highway and were killed by Japanese troops. Much like the rally calls of remember the maine and remember the Alamo bolstered the returning troops in 1944 to fight more fiercely to recapture the island and liberate the troops. According to the Japanese Bushido Code it was a great dishonor to surrender and that is why they were mistreated. They were also forced into hard labor and if they were sick and couldn't work they were not fed.

ceBTTCPwaa	Siddhartha is an allegorical novel by Hermann Hesse which deals with the spiritual journey of an Indian boy called Siddhartha during the time of the Buddha.<br>  The book, Hesse's ninth novel, was written in German, in a simple yet powerful and lyrical style. It was first published in 1922, after Hesse had spent some time in India in the 1910s. It was published in the U.S. in 1951 and became influential during the 1960s.<br>  The word Siddhartha is made up of two words in the Sanskrit language, siddha (gotten) + artha (meaning or wealth). The two words together mean "one who has found meaning (of existence)" or "he who has attained his goals". The Buddha's name, before his renunciation, was Prince Siddhartha Gautama, later the Buddha. In this book, the Buddha is referred to as "Gotama".<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_(novel)" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siddhartha_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Siddhartha_%28novel%29" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Siddhartha_%28no...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/sid/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/sid/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/siddhartha/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/siddhartha...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/Siddhartha/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/Siddhartha/ind...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmSiddhartha02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/siddhartha" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barrons/siddhartha.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a>

AA11712689	Judge Marshall only passed away in 1993 at the age of 84. <br>  His second wife,Cecilia "CISSY" Suyat was a bit younger than the judge, so I'd say she probably is very much alive.<br>  Cecilia Suyat was a younger woman when she married the Judge in 1955, so she's probably in her late 60s/early 70s.<br>  (Yep, she's alive, here's an interview she did 10 months ago for channel 9 in Virginia and a photo...)<br>  <a href="http://www.wusa9.com/life/people/jc_friends/story.aspx?storyid=70184&catid=104" rel="nofollow">http://www.wusa9.com/life/people/jc_frie...</a><br>  <br>  Of course, also are their two sons, they are around my age.<br>  <br>  Thurgood Marshall, Jr., was a former top aide to President Bill Clinton, and currently lives in DC with his wife and two teenage sons.<br>  John W. Marshall, who is a former United States Marshals Service Director and since 2002 has served as Virginia Secretary of Public Safety under Governors Mark Warner and Tim Kaine.<br>  <br>  Tim Kaine is still governor of Virginia.<br>  I was a resident of the State of Virginia and would regularly see John W. Marshall on TV quite a bit.<br>  <br>  John W. was also a former Virginia State trooper, Narcotics Division Special Agent, Training Academy Instructor, and Field Operations Sergeant. From 1994 to 1999, he served as United States Marshal for the Eastern District of Virginia. In 1999, he was appointed as the first African-American Director of the United States Marshals Service.<br>  <br>  He currently resides in Virgnia, near Richmond.<br>  <br>  You've actually probably seen both of his sons on TV and just never put two and two together.  Cecilia Suyat Marshall was Filippino-Hawaiian and their sons do have a more exotic "look" than their father did.
AA11510199	everything in her predictions allready happend<br>  a death<br>  a betrayel<br>  and a revelation<br>  or somthin like that|`|qzkWahFeaa	I believe that he would suffer from a loss and have hardship awaiting him. He had the most twisted or difficult path ahead of him.|`|WEMZGN6Gaa	read the book and find out
AA11850523	the same as their USA neighbors
qzkWahFeaa	Well, Edward hears minds and Renesmee projects into minds previous events of her life through touch. I wouldn't say they are opposite, I would say they are just similar. I guess because with Edward, he sees/hears your mind, but Renesmee makes you hear/see her mind.|`|AH9aiEb8aa	Edward hears peoples thoughts. Renesmee puts thoughts into peoples heads.|`|HSHIx96Laa	well edward hears other peoples thoughts and renesmee shows people her thoughts without speaking
IRjm8Artaa	I'd assume it's more a matter of him assuming that OTHERS will lust over the characters in his books - sex sells.|`|42OXwp7Uaa	I've only read half of the first Maximum Ride book and was forced to put it down. The writing was terrible! (no offense to anyone who likes his books) I wonder why his books are bestsellers, though.|`|KtS7SUDWaa	I personally enjoyed the Maximum Ride books. The 4th one kinda sucked though.|`|3KRtxG8faa	never read anyof them didnt want to waste my time
8e9a28782c8446395b12f275754b4b76aa	First of all, it's moat, not motte. They were dug with, of course, shovels. The practice of digging ditches in front of walls to increase defense effectiveness began as far back as the Bronze Age. The Mycenaeans did it, and I suspect it was common practice for other Mediterranean peoples as well. The Romans dug ditches called fossa as a standard part of fortifications. The practice continued through the Middle Ages. We typically consider moats as being filled with water, but that's not a requirement. In order for a moat to fill with water it would either have to be dug to an impermeable bedrock, dug beneath the water table, or lined with clay and gravel. I doubt there was a standard way of going about it, perhaps someone with a background in engineering history could answer that for you.
vUG2ishzaa	Because he was far more ruthless and he was in Russia at the time Trotsky was not.
Iwk92vqyaa	Bella. I say this for these reasons: Her decision to apparently become dumb. Her affinity for falling into glass objects, no matter what  circumstance. Her amazing loss of blood, more than once, taken as 'not very important,' Doc C will fix it. Her lack of regard for anyone but something (not a 'real' vampire even for fiction) who is actually and truly 'cold,' 'stony,' 'too strong' and a 'stalker' and who leads Bella away from friends, family and actual true life. Bella got stupid really quickly in that book. For a girl who was at first considered to be so 'smart'- What happened? She ditches it for a non-guy? Because he pays attention to her when he ignores everyone else? Not so hot an idea to base any relationship on. Bella dumbed down considerably to continue there.<br>  Or was it because he glittered in sunshine, and smelled good to her? Not a good idea.|`|uP9SQhkcaa	Uhm, HELLO?! JAMES. he is trying to KILL her. its pretty obvious, no offense. Anyways, Rosalie is NOT her enemy. (: Bella has a lot of enemies, though. I would say James, Victoria, and Lauren (mean girl, haha).<br>  <br>  Loves,<br>  Alice Danielle|`|AqScVZeCaa	well as an enemy i would say james as edward would kill rosalie for hurting bella, but james and victoria  are the conflicting people|`|0WKkXIyKaa	erm, haven't you read the books?<br>  <br>  I thought her enemies where James, Victoria and Laurent - she does spend the first 3 novels trying to defeat/run away from them/|`|qzkWahFeaa	James, Victoria, and the Volturi. The Volturi in the way that they want to take her away or kill her and whatnot. Rosalie has a perfectly decent explanation for disliking her, but she wouldn't harm Bella.

KADDz1EPaa	1300 Italy was in the era of municipal civilization. There were struggles between the Guelphs and Ghibellines. Some municipalities were allied with the German Empire. Others with the Pope <br>  <br>  Florence was a city rich with its bankers and was exceptional in terms of literature (Dante).<br>  <br>  by el Futigador Italian expert in history
KADDz1EPaa	Early guns keep their spark ; By armament standards, flintlocks were a relatively late invention in 1640. Long before that, Chinese warlords were lobbing missiles at opposing forces, often driven by gunpowder.<br>  <br>  By el fustigador
